In truththese exist only as illusions and delusions in the manufactured movie we are told is\"life\". They are figments of our perception, that's all.Through these years there has rarely been a day in which I have not worked insome way to uncover or communicate the astonishing story of how a network ofinterbreeding bloodlines going back to the ancient world has expanded its controlover the human population until, today, a full-blown global dictatorship is withinits sight and within its grasp. To understand the true background to the horrors ofSeptember 11th 2001, you have to research and understand so many subjects, manyof them considered bizarre or crazy to our conditioned reality. Once the pieces areunderstood then the puzzle has to be put together to allow the extraordinarypicture of human existence to be revealed. So when people ask me why thisinformation has never been made public before there are three main answers: (a)many researchershaveuncovered aspects of it, even large swathes of it, butcommunicating what they know through the mainstream media has beenimpossible; (b) the compartmentalised secrecy behind which the truth is hidden hasbeen extremely effective; and (c) because of the staggering amount of research overso many years that is necessary to understand the pieces even before the puzzleitself can be addressed.Without this background knowledge the manipulators can hoodwink the globalpopulation by explaining away grotesque atrocities like September llth with aridiculous cover story that protects the real perpetrators and justifies the responses,like the \"war\" with Afghanistan, that further their goal of global dictatorship. In mylast three books on these subjects,And The Truth Shall Set You Free, The Biggest Secret,andChildren OfThe Matrix, Ihave presented a total of 1,500 pages detailing thestory of human control and how the same interbreeding bloodlines that producedthe kings and queens of the ancient world now produce the presidents, primeministers, banking and business leaders, media owners and military chiefs of theI"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"2\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want.

Readers of myother books will already be well versed in this information.Bloodlines and the \"divine\" right to ruleThe families that covertly control the system that controls the people are spawnedfrom ancient bloodlines that have a different DNA to the rest of the population. Ithas been described to me by insiders as a DNA \"corruption\". The differences in theDNA are tiny, but highly significant. In fact in DNA terms there is not that muchdifference between humans and mice, but look at the fantastic difference in howthey manifest and what they can do. When you look back through history you findthe theme of the \"divine right\" of kings and queens. What is that? It is the right torule ...because of your bloodline, your DNA. Iwill go into the origins of these rulingfamilies and what is really meant by \"divine\" at the end of the book. It is sochallenging and mind-blowing to most people it is best left until much more hasbeen said. Suffice to say that these bloodlines are not \"human\" in the sense that weperceive the term \"human\". This rule-by-bloodline still openly exists today, ofcourse, with Queen Elizabeth II, an obvious example. She only lives in BuckinghamPalace and enjoys all the power and privilege of a head of state because of herDNA. If she had a different DNA she might be cleaning the throne rather thansitting on it. The same applies to the rest of her family, which is strictly structuredaccording to its DNA relationship to the reigning \"monarch\". As the ancient recordsconfirm, it was the \"royal\" bloodlines (the \"demi-gods\") that were placed inpositions of ruling royal power thousands of years ago. They were the kings andqueens in Egypt, Sumer, the Indus Valley and around the world who claimed thedivine right to rule because of their bloodline. What people don't realise is that thepolitical, business, banking and media leaders are also overwhelmingly operatingwithin a similar DNA hierarchy that decides who does what. This is because theyare of the same bloodlines as the ancient royal and aristocratic families who ruledthousands of years ago. The same interbreeding \"royal and aristocratic\" tribe hascontrolled the world for all this time. Only the positions from which they operatehave changed.Fantastic cataclysms struck the earth around perhaps 11,500 to 12,000 years ago.These destroyed, in stages, vast continents in the Atlantic and Pacific that havebecome known as Atlantis and Mu or Lemuria. The universal stories of the GreatFlood are related to this. After these literally world-shattering events, and othersthat followed, the \"divine\" bloodline installed itself again in various locations. Thishappened most significantly in the Near and Middle East, especially from about"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Alice inWonderland andtheWorldTradeCentreDisaster•The realagenda behind 9/113Figure 1:The highly advanced cultures in the Middle-Near East with Sumer the most powerful and significant. Fromthis region have come many of the bloodlines that thousands of years later continue to control the world4,000BC with an empire based on Sumer in what is now called Iraq, and it waslocated between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Sumer, according to official history,was the start of human \"civilisation\" as we know it, but in fact it was merely the re-start after the Atlantis/Mu upheavals(Figure 1).The bloodline was placed in thepositions of royal and administrative power over the people in Sumer, Egypt,Babylon, the Indus Valley and much further afield, including the Americas andChina. Over thousands of years, these bloodlines expanded out of the Middle andNear East into Europe, and the royal bloodlines of Sumer, Egypt, etc., became theroyal and aristocratic families of Britain, Ireland and the countries of mainlandEurope, especially France, Germany and what is now called Belgium(Figure 2overleaf).Wherever they went these royal and aristocratic lines interbred obsessivelywith each other through arranged marriages and secret breeding programmes. Youcan see the same with the ruling families of today because they are seeking toperpetuate a particular genetic code, the DNA \"corruption\" that can be quicklydiluted by breeding outside of their bloodline circle.The bloodline empiresIn ancient times Babylon was one of the headquarters of the secret society network- the \"Illuminati\" - through which these bloodlines manipulate humanity.

It's just a choice right nowbetweenfear and love.Figure 2:From at least 3000bc, peoples of the Sumer Empire, like the Phoenicians and Egyptians, sailed toBritain and took their knowledge and symbols to those islands. Others began to move across land to settle inwhat we now call France, Germany, and the rest of northern Europe. Wherever they went, the Illuminatibloodlines invariably ruled as kings, queens, and nobilityheadquarters to Rome and it was during this time that we had the Roman Empireand the creation of the Roman Church or institutionalised Christianity. Theheadquarters eventually moved on again into northern Europe after the fall of theRoman Empire and for a period it was based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Thiswas when the Dutch began to build their empire through the Dutch East IndiaCompany and they settled South Africa. In 1688, William of Orange, one of thebloodlines, invaded England from The Netherlands and took the throne as WilliamIII in 1689. William ruled jointly with Queen Mary and then by himself after herdeath in 1694. In that year William signed the charter that created the Bank ofEngland, and the global banking system began to emerge. Banking andmanufactured debt has always been one of the key vehicles used by the bloodlinesto control humanity. From this time the bloodlines and their Illuminati secret societynetwork moved their centre of operation to London and what followed, of course,was the \"great\" and enormous British Empire. This was not the Empire of the\"British\" in truth, but that of the Illuminati bloodlines based in Britain.The hidden handThis vast expansion of the British and other European empires to all parts of theworld exported these bloodlines to every continent, including, most importantly"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"AliceaWonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•The real agenda behind 9/11\t5today, North America. When the European empires began to recede and collapse,especially in the 20th century, it appeared that these colony continents, like theAmericas, Africa, Asia and Australasia, had won their \"independence\". Instead theIlluminati bloodlines were merely exchanging open. control for the far moreeffective covert control - manipulation of events by the Hidden Hand that thepublic has no idea even exists. While these empires were apparently beingdismantled, the Illuminati left in their \"former\" colonies, including the UnitedStates, the bloodline and the secret society network through which they manipulate.Ever since that time they have continued to control events in these \"former\"colonies as part of a long-planned agenda to impose centralised control of theplanet and its people. This is designed to be structured as a world government,army, central bank and currency; a micro-chipped population connected to a globalcomputer; and a society based on constant and total surveillance of every man,woman and child. A ridiculous conspiracy `theory'? Well have another look aroundand you'll see that this is happening today, now, and never more blatantly thansince September 11th. We are seeing unfold by the day the very Big Brother societydescribed by George Orwell (real name Eric Blair) in his famous book, 1984.11believe that Orwell was not writing from his imagination so much as from insiderknowledge of the agenda and this is the very governmental structure that is nowstaring us in the face -especiallysince September 11th. The need for centralisation isobvious. The greater the diversity of decision-making the less control you are goingto have over those decisions. Diversity is the controllers' nightmare and they haveworked constantly to centralise decision-making and increase their power. Thereason that the centralisation in all areas of our lives, political, economic, business,military and media has progressed with a faster and faster pace is a simpleequation. The more you centralise power the more power you have to centraliseeven quicker.The bloodline presidentsThe bloodlines that seek to control the world and our lives today are the samebloodlines that ruled the ancient societies. They are the presidents of the UnitedStates, the prime ministers, the leading banking and business families, the mediaowners and those who control the military. The US presidents are a wonderfulexample of this. There are some 280 million people in the United States today andmany hundreds of millions more have lived in that country since the majorFreemason George Washington was inaugurated more than 200 years ago. Not onlythat, the genetic diversity of the American people has been enormous because of themany locations from which they have come. So you would expect that the 43presidents from Washington to George W. Bush would express some of thatdiversity, surely? After all, one of the mantras supporting the myth of American\"freedom\" is that anyone can become President of the United States. Er, sorry. Thegenetic diversity of the US presidents is incredibly limited and fundamentallyconnected to European royal and aristocratic bloodlines (seeThe Biggest SecretandChildren Of The Matrix).Of the 43 presidents, 34 go back genetically to Charlemagne"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"6\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. ft's just a choice right now between fear and love.(742-814), the most famous monarch of what we now call France and a major figurein the Illuminati story and the bloodline. He was leader of the Franks, after whomwe get the name France, and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. From theIlluminati point of view, he was serious bloodline.In the last weeks of the farcical 2000 US presidential election campaign,Burke'sPeerage,the blue-blood \"bible\" of royal and aristocratic genealogy, confirmed thetheme I am highlighting here. Four years earlier, when Bill Clinton faced Bob Dole,Burke's Peeragesaid that the candidate with the most royal genes had won everysingle presidential election in US history. Clinton and George W. Bush have sincecontinued that unbroken sequence. In a Reuters report of October 17th 2000,BurkesPeerageconfirmed that both George W. Bush and \"opponent\" Al Gore were of royaldescent with Bush the \"bluer\" of the two. Purely by knowing his bloodline andwatching the behind-the-scenes developments, I was able to predict three yearsbefore the 2000 election that George W. Bush would be the next President of theUnited States. Bush is related to every European monarch on and off the throne,including the king of Albania, and has \"kinship\" with every member of Britain'sroyal family, the report said. He is a 13th cousin of Britain's Queen Mother, whodied in 2002 at the age of 101, and her daughter, Queen Elizabeth. Bush is a 13thcousin, once removed, of the heir to the throne Prince Charles, and has a directdescent from Henry III and from Henry VIII's sister, Mary Tudor, who was also thewife of Louis XI of France. Bush is further descended from Charles IT of England.Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director ofBurke's Peerage,said in the Reutersreport: \"It is now clear that Mr Gore and Mr Bush have an unusually large numberof royal and noble descents.\" But only unusual if you don't know the story. Headded: \"In point of fact, never in the history of the United States have twopresidential candidates been as well endowed with royal alliances.\" Brooks-Bakersaid there had always been a significant \"royal factor\" in those who aspire to theWhite House with presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Franklin andTheodore Roosevelt, and Ronald Reagan, among others, all boasting blue-bloodlinks. He said that Al Gore, a cousin of former President Richard Nixon, was adescendant of England's Edward I and has direct links to the Holy Roman Empirethrough Emperors Louis 11, Charles II, and Louis I. This, therefore, makes him adescendant of Charlemagne, the 8th century Emperor. These Charlemagne linksmake Al Gore a cousin of George W. Bush.The secret language - symbolismThe bloodlines and their Illuminati network are obsessed with symbolism and theirsymbols and codes going back thousands of years can clearly be found throughoutAmerican society and the rest of the world. The ancient Illuminati symbol of thepyramid with the capstone missing or the pyramid and all-seeing eye was placedon the dollar bill(Figure 3)in1933/34 by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, oneof the most significant front men for the Illuminati in the United States during the20th century.

The Illuminatilighted torch is held by the Statue ofLiberty. This was given to New York byFrench Freemasons in Paris who knewwhat she and the torch reallysymbolised. There is a virtual mirrorimage of the Statue of Liberty on anisland in the River Seine in Paris. TheStatue of Liberty is, in fact, the symbolicimage of Queen Semiramis, the goddessworshipped by the Illuminatibloodlines when they were based inBabylon. If you look atFigures 4and 5(overleaf)you can see the image ofQueen Semiramis on an ancient coinand her representation as the Statue ofLiberty. The Babylonian trinity was:Nimrod, who was symbolised as a fish;Tammuz or Ninus, the son who died tosave humanity; and Queen Semiramis,the mother goddess who wassymbolised as a dove. The Illuminati use what I call reverse symbolism. They placetheir symbols all around us but present them with the reverse of their true meaning.For example, the dove symbolises peace to most people, but to the Illuminatibloodlines it represents their goddess, Queen Semiramis. The lighted torch meansfreedom and liberty to the population, but to the Illuminati it is the very symbol oftheir agenda and control. The Nazis reversed. the ancient symbol of the swastika tosymbolise the negative and Satanists have reversed the pentagram to pointdownwards for the same reason. Everything is symbolism and ritual to theIlluminati, and always has been. Aftertheykilled President Kennedy in Dallas in1963, the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry placed an obelisk in Dealey Plaza with alighted torch at the top. When they buried Kennedy at Arlington Cemetery inWashington DC they placed a lighted torch, the Illuminati eternal flame, on hisgrave. The spot where people leave their tributes to the murdered Princess Diana inParis is a massive representation of the flame held by the Statue of Liberty. It islocated on top of the Pont de L'Alma Tunnel where the Illuminati arranged for herto die in 1997 (seeThe Biggest Secret).Queen Semiramis, which translates as \"branch bearer\", was symbolised inBabylon as a dove and when the Illuminati bloodlines moved their headquarters toRome this goddess was worshipped as Venus Columba or Venus the Dove. TheFrench word for dove is still colombe. This is why a man who signed his name\"Colon\" is known to official history as \"Columbus\". He was bearing the branch ofthe dove into the Americas in 1492 and was given this symbolic name relating to theFigure 3:The ancientIlluminatisymbol of thepyramidand all -seeing eye on the dollar bill"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"8This \"world\"isonly an illusion and we canchange itany time we want.It's just a choicerightnow betweenfear and love.Figure 4:Thisis howthe Illuminati goddess, QueenSemiramis, the \"branch-bearer\", was portrayed bythe ancientsFigure 5:Semiramisagain,thistime under the guiseof the Statueof \"Liberty\"Illuminati \"Goddess\". So we have the centre of US government located inWashington \"DC\" - the District of Columbia, or the dove, Semiramis. We haveBritish Columbia in Canada, Columbia Broadcasting (CBS), Columbia University,and Columbia Pictures with the symbol of the woman and the lighted torch. Thesymbols abound in relation to September 11th, also. The twin towers, or twinpillars, are ancient Illuminati symbols that go back at least to Atlantis. One of thefoundation legends in the Mythology of the Freemasons and the Knights Templarsecret societies is that of Jachin and Boaz ... the \"Twin Pillars\" of Atlantis, which aresaid to have been erected at the entrance to King Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem. Inthe Old Testament you will find references to this:And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up theright pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the leftpillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.(1 Kings 7:21)And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, andthe other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin,and the name of that on the left Boaz.(2 Chronicles 3:17)You will find the symbol of the twin pillars in Freemasonic architecture and theoriginal ones are said to have been built, according to Freemasonic legend, byinhabitants of Atlantis called \"the children of Lamech\". The United States is the\"New Atlantis\" to the Illuminati. There is a legend of the twin pillars, or twintowers, in which one represented Upper Egypt (the \"north tower\") and the othersymbolised Lower Egypt (the south tower). There is also the mythology of the twinpillars of Hercules that he is said to have placed at the entrance to theMediterranean. The number 11 itself, of course, consists of twin columns and first"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Alice inWonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Thereal agendabehind 9/11\t9plane to hit the twin towers on September 11th was Flight 11. The recurrence of 11in the events of that day are remarkable -but highly predictable for those whostudy Illuminati ritual.' It was 11 years to the day before 9/11 - September 11th1990 - that Father George Bush made a speech to Congress calling for a NewWorld Order. This is the ancient code name for the Illuminati agenda for globalcontrol that the terrorist attacks were designed to advance. The Pentagon was alsotargetted on September 11th. The symbol of the pentagon is the centre of thepentagram, the most obvious symbol of Satanic and Illuminati ritual and 911 is thephone number that Americans call to report emergencies. This is not a coincidence,as anyone who has studied the Illuminati's astonishing obsession with symbolismwill know. In the final chapter I'll explain where this obsession comes from. Thename Capitol Hill is also Illuminati symbolism and named after Capitoline Hill, asacred place for the Illuminati outside Rome during the Roman Empire. (SeeTheBiggest Secretand the symbolism archives on my website for extensive informationabout the Illuminati secret language that can be seen all around us.) Thesymbolism can. also be found in their language and statements. To crack their code,you have to reverse what they appear to say. When they announce that theybelieve something, it means they don't. When they say they will do something, itmeans they won't. When they say they won't, it means they will and so on. It is areal life Alice in Wonderland.. They operate with this coded symbolism in whicheverything is reversed. Thus killing thousands of Afghan civilians becomes\"fighting for freedom, peace and justice\". Reverse \"theirs\" to \"ours\" in thisstatement by George W. Bush after September 11th, for example, and he is actuallytalking about himself and those who control him:\"Theirs is the worst kind of cruelty, the cruelty that is fed, not weakened, by tears.Theirs is the worst kind of violence, pure malice while daring to claim the authority ofGod. We cannot fully understand the designs and power of evil, it is enough to knowthat evil, like goodness, exists. And in the terrorists evil has found a willing servant.\"The IlluminatiThe world's \"elite\" families, no more than 13 at the peak of the pyramid,manipulate their control of humanity through a network of secret societies. Thisnetwork and the interbreeding bloodlines it serves have become known as theIlluminati, the 'Illuminated Ones'. The Illuminati is an organisation within allsignificant organisations. It's like a cancer. All the major secret societies feedcarefully chosen recruits into the Illuminati and these are the ones you find inpositions of power throughout the world. They infest all colours, races, creeds andcountries, and yet, so effective is the compartmentalised secrecy that even the vastmajority of people within these secret societies have no idea what they are reallypart of. Most Freemasons never progress higher than the bottom three levels ofdegree, the so-called Blue Degrees. They have no idea what their organisation isbeing used for. Even most of those who make it to the apparently highest level, like"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"10This\"world\" is only anillusionand we can change itanytime we want.

Only the tiny few, all from particular bloodlines and their offshoots,progress through the official peak of their 'individual' secret society into theIlluminati degrees above that. These are the levels into which the secret societiesfeed the chosen ones, but at least 95% of their members have no idea that theselevels exist, never mind who is in them and what happens there. Among the keysecret societies within the Illuminati web are the upper levels of the Freemasons,Knights Templar, Knights of Malta, Knights of St John of Jerusalem, and the Jesuits,the network that controls the Roman Catholic Church and uses it to serve theIlluminati. The Jesuit hierarchy is extremely powerful within the Illuminati all overthe world and highly significant in the manipulation of global society. Some of thefamily lines involved are the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, House of Lorraine,Habsburgs, and the Thurn and Taxis dynasty from Bergamo, Italy, which expandedinto Belgium, Bavaria, and wider afield. The Thurn and Taxis bloodline is alsohighly significant to the Illuminati although not mentioned by researchers as oftenas some of the others.The freemasonsJim Shaw, a former 33rd-degree Freemason, exposes the Craft in his book,TheDeadly Deception'and confirms what I have just described. He explains howFreemasonry is based on a structure of compartmentalised pyramids(Figure 6).Only a few make it to the top of the 33 degrees of the Scottish Rite or the 10 degreesof the York Rite and even then they still don't know the real secrets. Shaw says hewas surprised when a fellow 33rd-degree Mason said that \"they\" had told him hewas \"going higher\" and the guy left the temple by a different door!,A biggerpyramid encompasses all the major secret societies and at that point they areonesecret society. So you have this vast web of secret societies with millions of membersworldwide who think they know what they are involved in, but, in truth, only afew have any idea of what is going on and who, ultimately, is calling the shots.Albert Pike, who died in 1891, was one of the most pre-eminent figures in worldFreemasonry Among his titles were Sovereign Grand Commander of the SupremeCouncil of the 33rd degree and Supreme Pontiff of Universal Freemasonry. In hisbook,Morals and Dogma,written for higher-degree Freemasons, he reveals the waythe lower levels are misled:'The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of the symbolsare displayed there to the initiate, but he is intentionally mis-led by false interpretations.It is not intended that he shall understand them, but it is intended that he shall imaginethat he understands them ... Their true implication is reserved for Adepts, the Princesof Masonry.'5Exactly. Jim Shaw says that there are two kinds of Freemason.

Theother does all the work, but only keeps to the ritual, and memorises or reads the"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Alice inWonderland and the World Trade CentreDisaster•The realagendabehind 9/1111Figure 6:The MasonicStructurewords without understanding what they really mean. That is correct, but there is athird kind: the very few who know the truth of who really controls Freemasonryand what the rituals and initiations are really designed to achieve. Shaw alsoconfirms from his own experience how the Freemasons manipulate their ownpeople into whatever positions they choose. At work, Shaw's department director, afellow Freemason, advised him to apply for a particular job. Shaw felt he wasunder-qualified for the post and would fail the test paper.' Only through the urgingof his Freemason boss did he apply. When he arrived to take the test he was amazedto see that there were only two other applicants for a job he believed would bekeenly contested. When he turned over the test paper, he saw that the questionswereveryeasy and he finished them quickly. His two rivals, however, were clearlyfinding the paper tough and could not complete it in the allotted time. Shaw got thejob.Why? Because he was not given the same paper as the other two.When he walked out of Freemasonry after realising the scam, the oppositehappened. He found his bosses far less supportive, to say the least. This is just onesmall example of how the Illuminati and their secret society web ensure that their"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"12This 'world\"is only anillusion and we can change it anytime we want.

It is actually astonishing how few people youneed to control in order to dictate your agenda through the whole system if they are(a) in the key positions of decision-making and (b) they have the power to appointthose in the important positions below them. An example: you control the chief ofpolice who decides the policy and he can appoint the heads of the variousdepartments in his force. He introduces Illuminati policy and chooses his majorsubordinates from secret society initiates. They, in turn, can appoint the peoplewithin their departments and can thus choose more secret society initiates for thepositions below them. So it goes on. Once you have control of the top man in anyorganisation, the pyramid is built in his, i.e. the Illuminati's, image. Governmentsare structured in the same way, as are \"security\" organisations like the FBI, CIA,British Intelligence and those who control the Pentagon. They arecompartmentalised pyramids in themselves, but there is also a pyramid thatencompasses all of them and can therefore coordinate a common plan of actionbetween them, exactly as it did on September 11th.Pyramids within pyramidsUnderstanding the pyramid structure is vital to understanding how the few canmanipulate the many on a global scale. The pyramid structure of secret societies ismirrored in government, banking, business and every other organisation andinstitution.

The Illuminati replace the `dolls' with pyramids(Figure 7).Every organisation today is a pyramid. Only the few at the top know thereal agenda of the organisation and what it is trying to achieve.

They are only aware of the individual job they doevery day. They don't know how their contribution (apparently innocent inisolation) connects with those of other employees in other areas of the company.They are compartmentalised from that knowledge and told only what they need toknow to do their job. The only people who know how it all fits together are the veryfew sitting at the top - the bloodline families and their lackeys.The smaller pyramids, like the local branch of a bank, fit into bigger and biggerpyramids, until eventually you have the pyramid that encompasses all of the banks.It is the same with the transnational corporations, political parties, secret societies,media empires and the military. If you go high enough in this structure all thetransnational corporations (like the oil cartel), major political parties, secretsocieties,media empires and the military (via NATO, for instance), are controlled bythe same families who sit at the top of the biggest pyramids. In the end there is aglobal pyramid that encompasses all the others, the biggest \"doll\" if you like. At thecapstone of this you will find the most elite of the Illuminati, the \"purest\" of theirbloodlines. In this way, they can coordinate through apparently unconnected, even\"opposing\" areas of society, the same policies because all roads lead eventually tothem - everything from the food we eat; the water we drink; the \"medical care\" wereceive, including vaccines; the \"news\" we watch and read; the \"entertainment\" weare given; the governments that dictate to us; the military that enforces the will ofthe governments; and the hard drug network aimed at destroying young people.The same families and their gofers control all of these areas and so much more. Thispyramid structure is how they have manipulated the explosion of centralisation inevery area of life: government, finance, business, media and military. It is not byaccident or natural occurrence, it is by coldly calculated design. The outstandingAustralian journalist John Pilger produced a rare and excellent expose ofglobalisation for British Independent Television in July 2001 in which he pointedout that just 200 corporations are now responsible foraquarterof the world'seconomic activity. But there is another level to this that we urgently need tounderstand. This pyramid system means that those '200' corporations are, in effect,oneCorporation controlled by the same force. Globalisation, which I and other\"conspiracy theorists\" were writing about long before it became fashionable, is justanother name for the Illuminati's centralised global fascist state, which I have beenexposing since the early 1990s. \"Glob alisation\" is not just a group of greedycorporations seeking to maximise profit, it is far, far, bigger than that.Manipulating the herdMost people find it impossible to accept that a few people can manipulate thelives of billions and operate through all institutions and countries. I understandthat; but once you have the pyramids in place and you know how to condition themind and reality of the population, it is relatively straightforward. When a fewpeople wish to control and direct a mass of humanity there are certain keystructures that have to be in place. These are the same whether you are seeking tomanipulate an individual, family, tribe, town, country, continent or planet.

It's just a choice right now between fear and love.you have to impose the 'norms', what is considered right and wrong, possible orimpossible, sane or insane, good and bad. Most of the people will follow those'norms' without question because of the baa-baa, herd mentality that hasprevailed within the collective human mind for at least thousands of years.Second, you have to make life very unpleasant for those few who challenge yourimposed 'norms'.The most effective way to do this is to ensure that it is, in effect, a crime to bedifferent. You make those who voice a different view, version of 'truth' andlifestyle, stand out like a black sheep in the human herd. You have alreadyconditioned the herd to accept your norms as its reality and, through arroganceand ignorance, they ridicule or condemn those with a different spin on life. Thispressurises the black sheep to conform and serves as a warning to those others inthe herd who are also thinking of breaking away or challenging the prevailingreality. There is a Japanese saying that goes, \"Don't be a nail that stands out abovethe rest because that's the first one to get hit.\" I could not put it better. This fear ofbeing different and voicing a view that challenges the \"norms\" is overwhelminglythe fear of what other people will think of us. In reality, the fear of what the sheeparound us will say and do if we seek to leave the herd and question its conditionedassumptions. This mentality creates a situation fundamental to the few controllingthe many because it means that the masses are policing themselves and keepingeach other in line. The sheep become the sheepdog for the rest of the herd. It is likea prisoner trying to escape while the rest of his cellmates rush to stop him. If thathappened we would say the prisoners were crazy, how could they do that? Buthumans are doing precisely the same to each other every day by demanding thateveryone conform to the 'norms' to which they blindly conform. This is nothingless than psychological fascism - the thought police with agents in every home,everywhere. Agents so deeply conditioned that most have no idea they are unpaidmind controllers. 'I'm just doing what's right for my children', I hear them say. No,what you have been programmed to believe is right for them and the belief, also,that only you know best.We see this same theme in our daily experiences of people in uniform and othersfrom the masses who are promoted to power over the masses. It's summed up bythe satirical version of the British Labour Party songThe Red Flag,which goes: \"Theworking class can kiss my arse, I've got the foreman's job at last.\" This is all part ofthe divide and rule strategy so vital to ensuring that the herd will police itself.Everyone plays a part in everyone else's mental, emotional and physicalimprisonment. All the controllers have to do is set the 'norms', pull the right stringsat the right time, and make their human puppets dance to the appropriate tune.This they do by dictating what is taught in what we bravely call 'education' andcontrolling what passes for 'news' through the Illuminati-owned media. In this waythey can dictate to the unthinking, unquestioning herd what it should believe aboutitself, other people, life, history and current events.

Butmy views must be \"bizarre\" to this media person because they are different to thoseaccepted. bytheir conditioned mind. Once you control what is considered 'normal'and possible, the whole system virtually runs itself.Obeying the lawIt is these hybrid Illuminati bloodlines, manifesting as political leaders andadministrators of government, that introduce the 'laws' that will best serve theirplan to keep humanity in ongoing servitude. The laws, which the masses have nosay in creating, are then enforced by members of those same masses - soldiers,policemen, security guards and so on. These guys, and many women today, aremere system fodder. They are not encouraged to think for themselves and it wouldnot be good for promotion if they did. They are paid to do as they are told, carryout orders and administer the letter of the 'law' - the law of the elite families. Iremember watching a car park attendant at a botanical garden where manyfamilies were enjoying a Sunday afternoon out. He strode up and down constantlychecking every car in turn looking for any that had outstayed their ticket. When hefound one he was positively orgasmic. My father used to say that rules andregulations are for the guidance of the intelligent and the blind obedience of theidiot. But how many of those in the peaked caps administer the law in a sensible,every-case-on-its-merits, think-for-yourself manner? A mere fraction, and oftenthey are far from popular with those higher up the ladder. Soldiers don't ask forjustification for blowing away men, women and children they have never met andknow nothing about (see Afghanistan, for example). They don't question theirsuperiors about why they have to commit genocide. They just do it because theyare told to do it and those doing the telling are themselves carrying out ordersfrom those above them. In the end, all lines of command lead ever upwards to the13 family bloodlines and their offshoots as they orchestrate their agenda to takeover the planet.The sheepleThe self-policing of the human herd goes far deeper than people in uniform oradministrators of government. It starts with conditioned parents who impose theirconditioning on their children and pressure them to follow their religious, political,economic and cultural 'norms'. One extreme example is those who insist that theiroffspring succumb to arranged marriages because of the rules of their ludicrousreligion. There are the children of Jehovah's Witnesses who have been denied life-saving blood transfusions because their brain-dead parents insist on conductingevery aspect of their lives according to the contradictory dictates of a bookpurveying so many stories of pure fantasy.

There are children of Christian, Jewish,Muslim or Hindu parents who don't accept the religion, but still follow it becausethey don't want to upset their family. Then there is the almost universal fear of whatpeople think of us if we speak a different version of reality or live a different kind oflife.Note that the fear for those who wish to break out of the sheep pen is not thefear of what the elite families, the Illuminati or 'Illuminated Ones', will think ofthem. Most have no idea that such a network exists. No, the fear is of what theirmother or father will think, or their friends and workmates - theverypeople whoare conditioned by the system to stay in the pen. The sheep are keeping the othersheep in line and making life unpleasant for anyone who tries to escape.The herd goes to war - with itselfIt is so easy for a small group of interbreeding family bloodlines to control the lives(in other words, the minds) of billions, once the key institutions of 'information' arein place, as they have been for thousands of years in their various forms. There arenot enough of these manipulators and their stooges to control the populationphysically and so they have had to create a structure in which humans controlthemselves through mental, emotional and, increasingly, physical imposition. Onceyou have the herd mentality policing itself, there is a third phase in this entrapmentof human consciousness. You create factions within the herd and set them to warwith each other. This is done by creating 'different' belief systems (which are notdifferent at all) and bringing them into conflict. These belief systems are known asreligions, political parties, economic theories and 'isms' of endless variety. Thesebeliefs are perceived as 'opposites' when, as I pointed out in my book,I Am Me, IAm Free,they areopposames.The vision of reality and possibility within the pen isso limited that it contains no opposites and the elite have to create the perception ofthem to manufacture the divisions that allow them to divide and rule. I mean, whatis the difference between a Christian bishop, Jewish rabbi, Muslim or Hindu priest,or a follower of Buddha, imposing their beliefs on their children and others? Thereis none because while the belief they seek to indoctrinate may be slightly different,often very slightly, the overall theme is exactly the same - the imposition of oneperson's belief on another. Look at the opposames in politics. The Far Left, assymbolised by Josef Stalin in Russia, introduced centralised control, militarydictatorship and concentration camps. The 'opposite' of this was the Far Right, assymbolised by Adolf Hitler. What did he impose? Centralised control, militarydictatorship and concentration camps. Yet these two opposames were set at warwith each other amid propaganda that claimed they were opposites. The onlydifference between the Soviet Union and the so-called 'West' during the Cold Warwas that the Soviet Union was openly controlled by the few and the West wassecretly controlled by the few. And when you get to the capstone of the pyramidyou find they were thesamefew controlling both 'sides'. The same force operatingthrough Wall Street and the City of London funded all 'sides' in the two world warsand that's provable (seeAnd The TruthShallSet You Free)."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Alice in Worrderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•The real agenda behind 9/11So the methods of manipulation can be summarised thus:•\tYou need to first imprison the human mind with a rigid belief and afundamentally limited sense of reality -- the sheep pen. It doesn't much matterwhat these beliefs may be, so long as they are rigid and discourage free thoughtand open-minded questioning. Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism and allthe rest each make their contribution to human servitude while apparentlyclaiming different 'truths'.•\tYou encourage those who follow these rigid beliefs to impose them on othersand make life very difficult and unpleasant for anyone who does not conform.•\tYou bring these beliefs into conflict, so ensuring the divide and rule you sodesperately need for control by the few. While the masses are busy fighting eachother, and seeking to impose their beliefs and views on each other, they don't seethat the Illuminati have strings attached to all of them. Humans are like mothsbuzzing around a light, so mesmerised by their religious belief, the footballscores, the latest row on a soap opera, or the price of friggin' beer, that they failto notice the preparations being made to smash them on the arse with a swatter.Problem-Reaction-SolutionThere are two techniques of mass manipulation that people need to understand ifthey are to begin to see through the game. One I have dubbed 'problem-reaction-solution' and the other I term the 'stepping-stones approach'. These have been usedfor thousands of years to advance the agenda and, together with fear, they remainthe most effective weapons of the Illuminati. Since I first used the term problem-reaction-solution as an alternative to its previous name, the \"Hegelian Dialectic\", ithas been constantly repeated among conspiracy researchers and otherscommunicating the techniques of control. This is fantastic because to understandthis simple, but devastating, method of human manipulation is to become so muchharder to fool. Problem-reaction-solution is the key to understanding what reallyhappened on September 11th 2001 and why. It works like this: you know that if youopenly propose to remove basic freedoms, start a war or centralise power, there willbe a public reaction against it. So you don't openly and honestly propose suchplans, you play the P-R-S scam. At stage one you create a problem. It could be acountry attacking another, a government or economic collapse, or a \"terroristattack\". Anything in fact that the public will think requires a 'solution'. At stagetwo, you report the 'problems' you have covertly created in the way you wish thepeople to perceive them. Crucially you find someone to blame for the problem, a\"patsy\" like Lee Harvey Oswald when President Kennedy was assassinated orTimothy McVeigh in Oklahoma. You spin the background to these events in a waythat encourages the people to demand that \"something must be done\". These arethe words you want to hear because they allow you to move on to stage three, the17"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"18This\"world\" isonly an illusionand we can change it any timewe want.Ws just a choiceright now betweenfear and love.sting. At this point you openly offer the solutions to the problems you have yourselfcreated.These solutions, of course, involve the centralisation of power, the sackingof officials or politicians that are getting in your way, and the removal of more basicfreedoms as you advance further to your global fascist state. Just ponder on thefreedoms that have been removed because of 9/11. A more subtle part of thetechnique is to propose far more extreme changes than you expect to get away withbecause this allows any opposition to think you have compromised and met themhalfway. But you know that you have other \"problems\" in the pipeline to push theagenda on.With this technique you can so manipulate the public mind that people willdemand or at least allow you to introduce what, in normal circumstances, theywould vehemently oppose. The Oklahoma bomb at the Alfred P. Murrah Buildingon April 19th 1995 was a problem-reaction-solution classic, as I explained inAndThe Truth Shall Set You Freeand will expand upon later. What followed the deathand destruction in Oklahoma were \"anti-terrorism\" laws that sailed throughCongress without challenge and removed fundamental freedoms from Americanpeople. Since September 11th this agenda has been advanced in gigantic leaps. Idon't share the attitudes of people like Timothy McVeigh, nor do I defend disturbedpeople like Osama bin Laden, but that's not the point. Establishing the truth of whathappened is the point, no matter what the views and attitudes of those involved. Ithink it is called justice. The two most effective problem-reaction-solutions in the20th century were the two global wars. They changed the face of the world, as warsalways do, and led to a massive centralisation of power. The United Nations, like itspredecessor the League of Nations, was an Illuminati creation to act as a Trojanhorse, or stalking horse, for world government.Media poodles ... woof, woof, lick, lickThe media play their part to perfection in these 'problem-reaction-solution'scenarios. At ownership level, people like Conrad Black at the Hollinger Group andRupert Murdoch of News international know what is going on. The editors theyappoint might know something about it, as may certain columnists, but most of thejournalists will have no idea. The editor is always there to block anything they writethat is against the interests of the Illuminati - as directed by the owner - and if theyinsist on pursuing an unwelcome story they find themselves looking for anotherjob.Most of the \"information\" that journalists present comes from official(Illuminati) sources anyway. In the immediate aftermath of a major event such asSeptember 11th where are the reporters getting their information? From officialsources. Name me a single piece of relevant information broadcast by themainstream media about what happened on 9/11, how it was done, who did it andwhat the retaliation should be, that did not come from official sources. Exactly.Nothing. We are told that White House sources say this, FBI sources say that, andCIA or Pentagon sources say the other. This is how the Illuminati transmit throughthe media the version of events they wish the public to believe. These reports areblazed across the front pages of newspapers and the top of radio and television"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"AliceinWonderland and the World TradeCentre Disaster•Thereal agendabehind9/1119news bulletins throughout the world, and what they say becomes the 'norm', theofficial \"history\". In the weeks and months that follow, researchers who areinterested in the real truth begin to dig away. Over and over they establish anddocument the proof of how the official version was a lie from start to finish. Butwhere are their reports published? In small-circulation newsletters, self-publishedbooks, and on radio stations that operate with a fraction of the money and potentialaudience of the Illuminati empires. Therefore, years after the official version hasbeen demolished it still prevails in the public mind. Stop anyone in London, NewYork, Cape Town, Sydney, anywhere, and ask them what happened on September11th, or in Oklahoma, the Second World War, or Kosovo. Almost every time theywill give you the official story because that is the only one they have heard.Stepping stonesThe bedfellow of problem-reaction-solution is the stepping-stones approach. Youknow where you intend to lead people, but you realise that if you gave them thetrue picture or went there in one giant leap, you would, once again, facesubstantial opposition. So you travel to your destination in little steps and eachone is presented in isolation and as unconnected to all the others. It is like a drip,drip, drip, to global centralisation. This technique was used most obviously withthe fascist superstate now known as the European Union. After the war if thepoliticians had suggested a centralised Europe with common laws and currencythere would have been an outcry. People would have said they had been fightingHitler to stop just such a European dictatorship and there was no way they wereaccepting another. To overcome this, the Illuminati offered a 'free trade area' andeven used the problem of their manipulated world wars to encourage morecooperation between the countries of Europe. Once they had the free trade area,however, the foot in the door, they began to expand its powers until it became thefully fledged political and economic dictatorship that it is today. The same ishappening with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and AsiaPacific Economic Co-operation (APEC), the 'free trade area' for Asia andAustralia, and the same is planned for the African Union that replaced theOrganisation of African Unity in 2001. 1 said inAndThe Truth Shall Set You Freein1995 that the NAFTA 'free trade area' would be expanded to the whole of theAmericas as the next stepping stone to a centrally controlled American Union. In2001, George W. Bush, an Illuminati bloodline, attended the Summit of theAmericas in Quebec, Canada, at which this expansion of NAFTA throughout theAmericas was agreed.Look at today's newspapers and television news bulletins and you'll see theproblem-reaction-solution and stepping-stones techniques played out day after day.One extremely effective way to see through this manipulation is to keep askingyourself a simple question when faced with these daily situations: 'Who benefitsfrom me believing this version of events, or accepting the solutions and changesbeing offered as a result?' The answer will be almost every time: anyone whowishes to centralise power and suppress more of our freedoms."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"20This\"world\"isonly an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and Jove.Blind faithOver thousands of years, religion has brilliantly served this structure for humancontrol. Religions have created rigid belief systems that should never be questioned.They have imposed those beliefs through fear, indoctrination, isolation, and themass genocide of non-believers. They have fought each other for dominance of thehuman mind, thus producing an explosion of opportunity for the Illuminati todivide and rule for millennia. Another question: \"is it more likely that an Illuminatithat has its origins in the ancient past, long before these religions were created, justhappened to 'get lucky' when such a perfect vehicle for human controlindependently emerged? ... or is it rather more probable that these institutions ofhuman enslavement were purposely created by these very same Illuminati toadvance their agenda?\" Look at where the major religions originated - in the veryMiddle/Near East where the Illuminati had its ancient headquarters. In theaftermath of 9/11 we have seen Islam used to manipulate the people, and all thereligions are used in the same way when the situation suits. But religion is not theconspiracy, and nor are economics, politics and all the rest. They are part of a vastweb of interconnected manipulation designed to persuade the masses to putthemselves in prison and throw away the key. The Illuminati work through everybelief system - religious, political, economic, racial and cultural - and throughevery side in the major 'debates'. The reason is simple. If you want to know theoutcome of a game before the game has even started, you need to control all sides.The manager of a football team cannot dictate the result if he only controls one side.If, however, he is managing both sides, he can ensure the result he wants before aball is kicked. So it is with the Illuminati, the hidden hand behind the events thataffect our lives and our world every day. We should be aware when contemplatingthe events in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania that the Illuminati operatethrough secret societies in the Near and Middle East every bit as much as they do inthe United States and the so-called \"West\".We see this manipulation of both sides in the protests against globalisation. Tocontrol the public perception of these gathering protests the Illuminati haveorganised their own agents provocateur to start the violence we see on the newsbroadcasts. See my websitewww.davidicke.comfor more detailed background tothis, including the account of how mainstream journalists watched the police linesopen at a protest in Spain to allow a group with weapons and masked faces towalk through to the peacefully protesting crowd. This group then started to attackeach other,thus 'justifying' a police charge on the peaceful gathering in whichpeople were battered by these uniformed head cases. Once the police interventionhad begun, the journalists watched the group who started the trouble walk calmlyback through the police lines to be driven away in police vehicles. One was askedif he was a policeman. \"Yes\" was his first reply when caught off-guard, but thenhe denied it. The manipulation of public perception goes on before our eyesminute by minute. September 11th was the most obvious example of this I haveyet seen."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre DisasterThe real agenda behind 9/1121Fresh air \"money\"One of the most important aspects of the bloodline-Illuminati control of humanity isthe money system. The Illuminati financial sting is very simple and spans theperiod from Sumer and Babylon to the present day. It is based on creating moneythat doesn't exist and lending it to people and businesses in return for interest. Thiscreates an enormous debt for governments, business and the general populationand you therefore control them. Vital to this has been permitting bankers to lendmoney they do not have. If you or me have a million pounds we can lend a millionpounds. Very simple. But if a bank has a million pounds it can lend ten times thatand more, and charge interest on it. If even a fraction of the people whotheoretically have money deposited in a bank went today to remove it, the bankswould slam the door in half an hour because they don't have it. Money in the bankis a myth, another confidence trick. When you go into a bank and ask for a loan, thebank does not print a single new note, nor mint a single new coin. It merely typesthe amount of the loan into your account. From that moment you are payinginterest to the bank on what is no more than figures typed on a screen. However, ifyou fail to pay back that non-existent loan, the bank can come along and quitelegally take your wealth that does exist, your home, land, car and possessions, tothe estimated value of whatever figure was typed on to that screen - plus interest.More than that, because money is not brought into circulation by governments, butby private banks making loans to customers, the banks control how much money isin circulation. The more loans they choose to make, the more money is incirculation.What is the difference between an economic boom (prosperity) and aneconomic depression (poverty)? One thing only - the amount of money incirculation. Through this system, the private banks, controlled by the sameIlluminati families, decide how much money will be in circulation. They cantherefore create booms and busts at will. It is the same with the stock marketsthrough which these families are moving trillions of dollars a day around thefinancial and banking system and deciding if they go up or down, soar or crash.Stock market crashes don't just happen - they are made to happen. Why would theIlluminati do this when they have so much money invested in these markets? Wellif you know the crash is coming because you are going to cause it, you know to sellat the highest point and buy back in once the crash has happened. In this way youcan increase your holdings massively by acquiring companies at a fraction of thecost before your manipulated collapse.Most of the \"money\" in circulation is not physical money: cash and coins. It isrepresented by figures passing from one computer account to anotherelectronically via money transfers, credit cards and chequebooks. The moremoney, electronic or otherwise, that is in circulation, the more economic activitycan take place and the more products are bought and sold, the more incomepeople have, and the more jobs are available. But a constant theme of thisIlluminati financial. coup has been to create a boom by making lots of loans andthen pulling the plug, causing a depression or crash. Overpaid economists and"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"22This\"world\" is onlyan illusionandwe canchange it any timewe want.It'sjusta choice right now between fear and love.economic correspondents, most of whom have no idea what is going on, will tellyou that boom and bust is part of some natural \"economic cycle\". It is not. It issystematic manipulation by the Illuminati to steal the real wealth of the world.During a boom many people get themselves into more debt. The vibrant economicactivity means that businesses borrow more for new technology to increaseproduction to meet demand. People borrow more to buy a bigger house and amore expensive car because they are so confident of their economic prospects.Then, at the most opportune moment, the major banks, coordinated by theIlluminati network, raise interest rates to suppress the demand for loans andbegin to call in loans already outstanding. They ensure they make far fewer loansthan before. This has the effect of taking units of exchange (money in its variousforms) out of circulation. This suppresses demand for products and leads to fewerjobs because there is not enough money in circulation to generate the necessaryeconomic activity. People and businesses can no longer earn enough to repay theirloans and they go bankrupt. The banks then take over their real wealth, theirbusiness, home, land, car and other possessions - in return for non-repayment ofa loan that was never more than figures typed on a screen.This has been going on in cycles over thousands of years, especially the last fewcenturies, and the real wealth of the world has been sucked out of the populationand into the hands of those who control the banking system - the Illuminatibloodline families. The same applies to countries. Instead of creating their owninterest-free money, governments borrow it from the private banking cartel and paythe interest and the capital (sometimes) by taxation of the people. A fantasticamount of the money that you pay in taxes goes straight to the private banks to payback loans of \"money\" that governments could create themselves interest free! Whydon't they do it? Simple. The Illuminati control the governments as much as theycontrol the banks. What we call \"privatisation\" is the selling of state assets inresponse to bank-created debt. The world's poorest countries are handing overcontrol of their land and resources to the Illuminati bankers because they can't payback the vast loans made, on purpose, by the banks to ensnare them in this verysituation. The world does not have to be in poverty and conflict. It is manipulatedto be that way because it serves the agenda. \"Third World\" debt was manufacturedto replace physical occupation of resource-rich or strategically situated countriesunder colonialism with today's financial occupation. The way they created thissituation is told in detail inAndThe Truth Shall Set You Free.Once a country isindebted to foreign banks, even though the money is non-existent credit, they areforced to hand over control of their affairs to the bankers, the World Bank and theInternational Monetary Fund, which then dictate economic and social policy atevery level. In the end all roads not only lead to the same cabal, they also lead to thesame word: control.Criminal bankruptcyWhen you begin to look behind the movie screen or, more appropriately, under thestone, you see a very different world to the one portrayed on CNN.

This apparently happened during the five yearsof Geneva Conventions in Switzerland between 1928 and 1932, but it seems thatthey don't publish the volume containing details of the bankruptcy declarations.The bankers said that either the countries declared bankruptcy to the Illuminatibanks or there would be no loans to get them out of the deep global depression atthat time. So they accepted official bankruptcy to the global banking system andthismeant, in effect, that the banks have owned those countries ever since.'Actually, I say countries. In fact, the United States is not a country, but acorporation, as revealed in my previous books and a stream of other publishedworks and studies. No doubt we will find that the situation is the same in othercountries too. This bankruptcy is actually in the United States Congressional Recordof March 17th 1993 (Vol. 33, page H-1303). James Traficant Jr of Ohio told the House:\"Members of Congress are official trustees presiding over the greatest reorganizationof any Bankrupt entity in world history, the US Government.

The UScorporation was created behind the screen of a \"Federal Government\" when, afterthe manufactured \"victory\" in the American War of Independence\", the Britishcolonies exchanged overt dictatorship from London with the far more effectivecovert dictatorship that has been in place ever since. In effect, the VirginiaCompany, the corporation headed by the British Crown that controlled the former\"colonies\", simply changed its name to the United States and other relatedpseudonyms. These include, today, the United States, US, USA, United States ofAmerica, Washington DC, District of Columbia, Federal Government and \"Feds\".The United States Corporation is based in the District of Columbia (QueenSemiramis) and the current president of the corporation is a man called George W.Bush. He is not the president of the people or the country as they are led to believe,that's just the smokescreen. This means that Bush launched a \"war on terrorism\" onbehalf of a private corporation to further the goals of that Corporation. It hadnothing to do with \"America\" and \"Americans\" because these are very differentlegal entities. It is the United States Corporation that owns the US military andeverything else that comes under the term \"federal\". This includes the FederalReserve, the \"central bank\" of the United States, which is, in reality, a private bankowned by controlling stockholders (and controllers of the US Corporation) that arenot even American. This is the bank from which the United States Corporationborrows \"money\" that is repaid with interest by the unknowing Americantaxpayers. The Federal Reserve was manipulated into being in 1913 and dictates theUS interest rate that has a massive knock-on effect on the rest of the world. TheFederal Reserve or \"Fed\" is currently headed by Alan Greenspan, a member ofIlluminati front organisations like the Bilderberg Group, Council on ForeignRelations and Trilateral Commission. His predecessor was Paul W. Volker of ... theBilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations and Trilateral Commission (seeAndThe Truth Shall Set You Free).The United States Corporation is owned by familiesand forces in Europe and the Jesuit-controlled Vatican is very much part of thiscovert ownership of not only the US, but major European \"countries\" also.Aye, aye, captain, er, judgeThe privately owned corporation known as the United States is the holdingcompany, if you like, and the 50 states are its subsidiaries. Therefore these statesalso declared bankruptcy, or had it declared for them by the holding company, the\"Federal Government\", but the people never knew and still don't. You can get thedetail about this elsewhere and I am only summarising the situation to give peoplean idea of how deep this conspiracy really goes.

From that moment you become responsible for financing thecorporation's state of bankruptcy. When you pay taxes or a court or parking fineand such like, you are servicing the bankruptcy by paying that money to\"government agencies\" that are nothing more than debt-collecting agencies for the\"creditor\" banks. The US court system operates under corporate law or the UniformCommercial Code (UCC) to administer the bankruptcy and fleece the sheep to payback the ongoing debt. This is also known as British Maritime (military) Law andthis is why the American flag always has a gold fringe when displayed in the courtsof the United States, and you find the same in government buildings and federallyfunded schools. The gold fringe is a legal symbol indicating that the court is sittingunder British Maritime Law and the Uniform Commercial Code - military andmerchant law not common or constitutional law. Under the Admiralty Law of Flagsthe flag displayed gives notice of the law under which the ship (in this case thecourt) is regulated. Anyone entering that ship (court) accepts by doing so that theyare submitting to the law indicated by that flag. Judges refuse to replace the flagwith one without a fringe when asked by defendants who know the score becausethat changes the law under which the court is sitting. If you appear in a court with agold-fringed flag your constitutional rights are suspended and you are being triedunder British Maritime (military/merchant) Law. The Uniform Commercial Codewas approved by the American Bar Association, which is a franchise, a subordinatebranch, of the British legal system and its hierarchy. As I have been writing formany years, the power that controls America is based in Britain and Europe(verymuch including the Vatican) because that is where the power is located that ownsthe United States Corporation. By the way, if you think it is strange that a court ondry land could be administered under Maritime Law, look at US Code, Title 18 B 7.It says that Admiralty Jurisdiction is applicable in the following locations: (1) thehigh seas; (2) any American ship; (3) any lands reserved or acquired for the use ofthe United States, and under the exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction thereof, or anyplace purchased. or otherwise acquired by the United States by consent of thelegislature of the state. In other words, mainland America. All this is founded onRoman law because the Illuminati have been playing this same game throughoutthe centuries wherever they have gone. The major politicians know that this is howthings are and so do the government administrators, the judges and lawyers, andinsider \"journalists\".Those who realise what is happening and ask the court for the name of the truecreditor or recipients of the fines imposed by the \"legal system\" are always refusedthis information by the judge. The reason is simple. The true creditors in such casesand the ultimate recipient of the fines are the bankers to which the corporation\"country\" is bankrupt. This is why more and more people in the US are refusing toregister in any way with the Federal Government as news and documentation ofthis bizarre situation continues to circulate.

The \"American\" president is simplythe corporation's chief executive officer.What we can doThere are two ways to meet a problem. We can look for a solution or, far moreeffectively, we can remove the cause. I go into these areas in detail in my otherbooks and talks, and I will return to this at the end of this one. But one key \"cause\"we need to eliminate is the way we allow ourselves to be divided and ruled alongthe fault lines of race, religion, political persuasion, income bracket, and the othervirtually endless list of human conflicts and divisions. If a major cause of humancontrol is division then to remove it we mustunite,simple as that. We will neveragree on everything and nor should we. What a boring world it would be if we did.But that does not mean we can't unite behind what we do agree on, and cometogether to protect and restore the freedoms that affect us all. Right wing, left wing,black, white, Christian, Muslim or Jew, everyone is a target for the Illuminati'sglobal fascist state. Unless people stop fighting among themselves in their arrogantand meaningless battles for superiority, we will all be divided and ruled in a globalversion of Nazi Germany or Communist Russia and China.I don't care what your religion may be, or your race or political belief. Whateverit is, you are entitled to it and you can do what you like for all I care, so long as youdon't seek to impose your will and belief on others. What I care about is the right ofeveryone to be free to follow his or her own freely chosen path through this GreatIllusion we call the 'physical' world. But for each of us to be truly free, weallhaveto be truly free. The loss of another person's freedom is a loss of our own also. Themurder of a child in Afghanistan is no less important than the murder of a child inNew York, nor vice versa. We are in this together and we need to grow up and cometogether. The number of people knowingly manipulating the Illuminati agenda is atiny fraction of the global population. They can only do it with our agreement andcooperation through self-interest, ignorance or terminal apathy. The pyramids ofcontrol are only there because we are holding them together. The power of apyramid is at the bottom, not the top, yet we seem blind to that fact. The Illuminatiare only up there because we are holding them up there.Our response must be peaceful because to meet violence with violence andhatred with hatred makes those who protest a mirror of those they protest against.What we fight we become, and it is vital that we don't fight the Illuminati and theglobal agenda, but instead cease to cooperate with it.

Surely before we makedecisions about what to believe we need to know if those who have peddled theofficial version of events can be trusted to tell us the truth. The next three chapterswill be full of names and interconnecting subjects, and I can understand that somemay find it overwhelming at times, but without this information it is not possible toappreciate the true context of September 11th and as this book unfolds that willbecome obvious. First of all, these \"world leaders\" are nothing like as powerful aspeople think they are, except over those below them in the Illuminati pyramid. Likeall the personnel in government, even at apparently exalted levels, they are puppetsof a higher authority in the hidden hierarchy that does not put itself on publicdisplay. The President of the United States, as with the Prime Minister of the UKand elsewhere, is a position for lieutenants of the Illuminati, not generals orcolonels. They are used to play out the game in the public arena and, so long as theydo that and say what they are told to say, their careers will flourish and theirhorrendous secrets will remain \"in-house\". Fail to serve the dragon, however, andyou press the self-destruct button, as with John F. Kennedy and his brother Bobby.There are those, like the Bush family and Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, whowillingly and enthusiastically dance to the Illuminati tune and take the \"power\"and rewards that come with that. Others are caught in the web and believe there isnothing they can do except comply.

They have produced two US presidents and asboth are called George Bush I will overcome the potential confusion in the text bycalling George H.W. Bush either George Bush or \"Father George\", and I'll refer tohis son, the current incumbent, as George W. Bush, \"Boy George\", or \"Dubya\". AsU.S presidents go, Father George is quite high up in the Illuminati compared withmost of them, but he's still small fry compared with those who really call the shots.His son, George \"Dubya\", of course, can just about summon the brain-cell activityto tie his shoelaces. I blame the inbreeding myself. Father George and wife Barbaraare both descendants of Godfroi de Boullion (also known as Godfrey of Boullion)who, in 1099, led European noblemen in the successful Crusade to recaptureJerusalem from the Islamic faith and moved into the King's palace at TempleMount, the alleged site of Solomon's Temple, which has been an historic obsessionfor the Illuminati that continues to the present time. Understanding this obsession isto understand so much about the terrible events in Jerusalem and the focus onTemple Mount by the religions of Christian, Jew and Muslim. Godfroi de Boullionwas the first King of Jerusalem and the Duke of Lower Lorraine, a major region forthe Illuminati bloodline to this day (seeThe Biggest Secret).So when George W.Bush, a descendant of de Boullion through both his mother and father, talked of a\"Crusade\" against \"Islamic\" terrorism after September 11th, that was no slip of thetongue or unfortunate gaffe as it was reported. He knew exactly what he wassaying and why. From this \"Crusade\" by de Boullion came the secret society calledthe Knights Templar, which is widely exposed in my other books. The KnightsTemplar is still a major arm of the Illuminati today with top people in globalpolitics, banking, business and media among its initiates. It was largely through theKnights Templar that the Freemasons, the world's biggest secret society, emerged.George and Barbara Bush are from the Pierce bloodline that changed its namefrom Percy after fleeing England in the wake of the Gunpowder Plot led by GuyFawkes (or so they say) to blow up the English Parliament and kill King James I in1605. This event is still celebrated in the UK every November 5th when effigies ofGuy Fawkes are burned on bonfires all over the country. The Bush ancestor ThomasPercy was one of the main plotters. George and Barbara Pierce Bush (of Merrill,Lynch, Fenner and Smith) are from the same bloodline as the US President, FranklinPierce, who was in the White House from 1853 to 1857. Other Bush relatives includethe Grosvenor families of England and America, the Tafts of Ohio, who producedWilliam Howard Taft, president from 1909 to 1913, and the Delano-Roosevelts, whoprovided President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1933-45) and Theodore Roosevelt(1901-19). The English Grosvenors are the Dukes of Westminster who own primeproperties in the City of London, one of the main financial and secret society centres"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"30This\"world' isonly anillusion and we can change it anytimewe want. It's justa choicerightnow betweenfear and love.for the Illuminati globally. The Grosvenors of America founded the NationalGeographic which is notorious for removing the archaeological treasures of theworld, especially those with religious significance, and relocating them at theSmithsonian Institute in Washington DC. The Institute is controlled by thoseGrosvenor cousins, the Smithsons, who in turn are descended from the Percys - thePierce bloodline that produced the Bushes.' The ancestry of both George Bushes canalso be traced to England's Alfred the Great and to Charlemagne, a highlysignificant figure in the Illuminati and bloodline story, and from whom 34 of the 43US presidents are descended. With both his father and mother having such seriousroyal and aristocratic ancestry, this gives Baby George a mass of bloodlineconnections, as documentedby Burke's Peerage.The Bushes are related to the Britishroyal family, who are big-time Illuminati, and the two are very close. Documentsapparently exist that reveal Bushh family business dealings with the Queen ofEngland through Coutts Bank in London and if anyone can give me more detailsabout that then please let me know.Dark secrets galoreThe Bushes have long been pillars of the infamous Skull and Bones Society based ina windowless mausoleum known as \"the Tomb\" alongside the campus at YaleUniversity at New Haven in Connecticut. Every year 15 bloodline students areinitiated into the Skull and Bones Society and the ratio of Skull and Bones initiateswho end up in positions of power in politics, banking, business, media andintelligence agencies in the United States, in front of camera and behind the scenes,ismassively greater than the general student population. George W. Bush is a Skulland Bones initiate (code name \"Temporary\" interestingly), along with FatherGeorge Bush, and the president's grandfather, Prescott Bush, one of the funders ofAdolf Hitler. Prescott Bush is most famous within the Skull and Bones \"Order\" forraiding the grave of the Native American Apache leader Geronimo. In May 1918Prescott Bush and five other Skull and Bones men ransacked the grave at Fort Sill,Oklahoma. They took turns to stand guard while others robbed the grave and tookaway artefacts and Geronimo's skull. This was taken to the Skull and Bonesheadquarters at Yale where it is used in their sick rituals and ceremonies. Thishorrible story is told in an internal history of the Skull and Bones Society and wasquoted to Ned Anderson, the Tribal Chairman of the San Carlos Apache tribe, whenhe was negotiating to have Geronimo's remains returned to the tribe's custody. A1989 article in the New Yorker said: \"One Bonesman ... recalled during the early 70sseeing perhaps 30 skulls, not all of them human, scattered about the Tomb [atYale].\"IThis is the mentality of the people running our world.The Bush men also have a long association with the diabolical rituals performedby the Illuminati bloodlines every July at a place called Bohemian Grove, located in2,700 acres of very secluded redwood forest near the hamlet of Monte Rio inSonoma County, 75 miles north of San Francisco. This is a ritual and sexualplayground for leading American and foreign politicians, mobsters, bankers,businessmen, media owners and editors, top entertainers, etc., who are initiates of"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre DisasterThe Bush family crime31the Illuminati or serve the agenda in some form. Among them are people likePresidents Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan; Vice President DickCheney; Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Casper Weinbergerand Bush family crony, James Baker; Alexander Haig, the former US DefenseSecretary; Alan Greenspan, the head of the Illuminati's US \"central bank\", theFederal Reserve; David Rockefeller, Illuminati manipulator for at least 50 years;television news anchorman Walter Cronkite; David Gergen, author and adviser topresidents for 30 years and. editor-at-large at USNews and World Report;andpresidents of major media operations like CNN and the Associated Press. In July1991, Dirk Mathison, the San Francisco bureau chief ofPeoplemagazine, owned bythe Illuminati's Time-Warner, sneaked into the Grove three times. On the thirdoccasion he was recognised by a Time Warner executive who threw him out and hisstory was not allowed to appear. Mathison said that John Lehman, a formersecretary of the Navy, delivered a lecture at the Grove that revealed how thePentagon estimated 200,000 Iraqis had been killed a few months earlier in the GulfWar - a figure not made public. Another speaker at the secret Grove gathering wasAl Neuharth, the founder ofUSA Today,who wasidentified in the officialprogramme as chairman of the Freedom Forum - a $700-million foundationdedicated to a \"free press\"!Cathy O'Brien, who was a mind-controlled slave of the Illuminati for some 30years, tells in her book,Trance-Formation Of America,'of how she and her fellowmind-slaves were forced to serve the perversions of their abusers at BohemianGrove. These include satanic rituals, child sacrifices, torture and blood drinking.Cathy says in her book: \"Slaves of advancing age or with failed programming wererituallymurdered at random in the wooded grounds of the Grove and I felt it wasonly a matter of time before it would be me.\" She says that the Grove has a numberof rooms for different perversions, including a Dark Room, a Leather Room, aNecrophilia Room and one known as the Underground Lounge, spelt asU.N.derground on the sign. I know this sounds seriously far out to peoples'conditioned sense of reality, but if you readThe Biggest SecretandChildren Of TheMatrix,as well as many other books by other researchers and victims, you will seethe enormous evidence to support all. this. I will explain why they are obsessed withrituals and blood drinking in the final chapter. These bloodlines can be shown tohave been involved in these sickening human sacrifice rituals since Babylon andbefore, and it continues to this day. InThe Biggest Secretthere is a photograph ofrobed and hooded men at the Grove standing alongside a large fire whileworshipping a 40-foot stone owl - an ancient Illuminati symbol. These world-famous Illuminati initiates at Bohemian Grove burn and sacrifice a human \"effigy\"under the owl at the start of their \"summer camp\" every year. This happens duringa Babylonian-type ritual called the Cremation of Care and in the year 2000 AlexJones, an American radio talk show host, took a hidden camera into the Grove andfilmed the ritual. He was too far away to see if the sacrifice was an \"effigy\" or real,but the human sacrifice rituals go on among the elite of the elite in much moresecret and secluded locations during the \"camp\".

At this point you hear very clearly a blood-curdling scream and one of two things are happening here.

President George W. Bush, like his father and grandfather, is aBohemian Grove attendee and arrived there shortly after the video was shot. TheJones footage appeared in a television documentary on the UK's Channel 4 in 2001,a programme that skimmed the surface of what really goes on at the Grove andmissed a wonderful opportunity. Alex Jones has a tendency to scream at the camera,which doesn't help his case, but he does some great work informing Americans oftheir plight. His own video of the Bohemian Grove footage is far better than the UKChannel 4 version and is well worth seeing. It is available throughInfowars.comThe Bush drug networkAmong the most important functions of the Bush family and the Skull and BonesSociety is putting illegal drugs like cocaine and heroin on the streets of America andaround the world. It was very wealthy aristocratic and other Illuminati bloodlinefamilies in Britain and the United States that launched the global drug trade andstill control it. They use their government agencies to \"bust\" any opposition andleave the field clear for themselves. This is what is happening when you hear newsreports of a \"big drug find\" or some villain or network being jailed for trafficking.The real players never get hit because they also control law \"enforcement\". TheIlluminati drug-running network not only makes vast sums to fund covert projects,it also destroys lives on a massive scale, and creates fear and divide and rulethrough the enormous division and crime generated by those who steal, rob andmug in a desperate attempt to get the money to feed their addiction. The Skull andBones Society is owned by the Russell Trust, an organisation controlled by theRussells, a drug-running bloodline family. They flew the skull and bones flag ontheir ships as they transported drugs for the British Empire from Turkey to Chinaand elsewhere during the Opium Wars of the 19th century. The skull and bones isan ancient Illuminati symbol used in its sacrificial rituals and secret language, notleast by the Knights Templar. Samuel Russell launched Russell and Company in1823 and within seven years it had absorbed the Perkins opium syndicate based inBoston. Russell's head of operations in Canton, China, was Warren Delano Jr, thegrandfather of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the US President during the SecondWorld War who was related to the Bush family. Roosevelt was also a cousin of hisfellow wartime leader, the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. Other famousfamilies (Illuminati bloodline) were partners in the Russell drug network - nameslike Coolidge, Forbes, Perkins, Low and Sturgis. It was Samuel Russell's cousin,William Huntington, and the Bush-related Alphonso Taft, the father of PresidentWilliam Howard Taft, who established the Order of the Skull and Bones in the US in1832 and attracted America's major bloodline families to its dark rituals and"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Afice in Wonderland and theWorldTradeCentreDisaster•The Bush familycrime33grotesque agenda - families that have dominated American politics, business,banking, and covert intelligence operations. They include the Rockefellers,Harrimans, Tafts, Lords, Kelloggs, Goodyears, Whitneys, Vanderbilts, Bundys,Sloanes, Perkins, and ... Bushes. The Skull and Bones men have always had a veryclose association with the US intelligence community and one of its most famous, orinfamous, members is Father George Bush, who served the Illuminati and crimesagainst humanity as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. (You'll find thedetailed and sourced background to the Skull and Bones Society and the Bushconnections inAnd The Truth Shall Set You Free.)Prescott Bush, funder of HitlerThe current president's grandfather, Prescott Bush, was a Senator for Connecticut,the home of the Skull and Bones Society. He was a golf partner of President DwightD. \"Ike\" Eisenhower, a military man who, like Colin Powell, enjoyed a fantastic riseto prominence because of his Illuminati sponsors. But \"Ike\" disappeared from viewafter he warned about the dangers to freedom posed by the \"Military-IndustrialComplex\" (the Illuminati) in the closing days of his presidency. Prescott Bush was akeen and active supporter of the eugenics (master race) movement along with hisbloodline associates, the Harrimans and Rockefellers. It was this clique, led by theRockefellers, that funded the work of Adolf Hitler's race \"purity\" expert, ErnstRudin, to such an extent that he could occupy an entire floor at the Kaiser WilhelmInstitute for Genealogy and Demography in Berlin. Soon after Hitler had abolishedelections and become dictator of Germany in 1933, the Rockefeller-funded, Bushand Harriman-supported, Dr Rudin was commissioned to write the Law for thePrevention of Hereditary Diseases in Posterity, which involved the forcedsterilisation of anyone considered genetically inferior. Father George's massivefunding of \"population control\" programmes is another modern example of thisfamily obsession. Once again the detailed and horrific story of the master racemovement supported by the Bushes, Harrimans, and Rockefellers is told inAnd TheTruth Shall Set You Free.Harry S. Truman, by the way, the Freemasonic Presidentwho ordered the atomic bombing of Japan, was a Rockefeller cousin.Prescott Bush was involved in supporting eugenics and Hitler's crazed masterrace \"philosophy\", and he was directly involved in funding the Nazi war machine.All sides in the First and Second World Wars were funded by the same people,mainly through sources in Wall Street and the City of London (seeAnd TheTruthShall Set You Free).The Illuminati use wars to change the face of society and createthe opportunity to introduce their agenda of constant centralisation of powerthrough the technique of problem-reaction-solution. They manipulate peoples andcountries into conflict and fund the genocide until the status quo society isdestroyed. Once that is achieved they can rebuild that society in line with theiragenda. This is what the two world wars of the 20th century and the endless otherconflicts have really been about - including Afghanistan and the \"war onterrorism\". Prescott Bush helped to finance Hitler through a company called theUnion Banking Corporation (UBC). Fritz Thyssen, a German steel entrepreneur and"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"34This \"world\"isonly an iliusion and wecanchangeitanytime.,we want. It's just a choiceright now between fear and love.banker, funded the Nazis from the early 1920s. His banking operation in Germanywas affiliated through a subsidiary with the W.A. Harriman Company in New York(Brown Brothers, Harriman after 1933), which in turn was funded, at least in itsearlier days, by the House of Rothschild. The Harriman family was prominent insupporting the Russian Revolution, Adolf Hitler and the master race insanity of theeugenics movement. A Fritz Thyssen company controlled the Union BankingCorporation in the US, which had E. Roland Harriman (Skull and Bones Society) onits board along with known Nazis and Nazi financial backers. Prescott Bush, fatherand grandfather of the future presidents, was also on the UBC board and owed hiswealth to the Harrimans. The trio of Brown Brothers Harriman, the Sullivan andCromwell law firm headed by Rockefeller cousin John Foster Dulles, and the UnionBanking Corporation of Prescott Bush and George Herbert Walker (Father George'sgrandfather), represented the interests of the Nazi business cartels in the UnitedStates at the time of the Second World War. John Foster Dulles would become USSecretary of State while his brother, Allen, was the first head of the CIA! In 1942 thegovernment seized UBC assets under the Trading With The Enemy Act, andstopped George Walker and Prescott Bush pouring money into Hitler's regime - atleast in theory. Eight days later, two other Bush-managed companies, the Holland-American Trading Corporation and the Seamless Steel Equipment Corporation,were seized for the same reason. These were followed by another Bush-Harrimanoperation, the Silesian-American Corporation.The Bush-Nazi connection was highlighted again more recently by John Loftus,the president of the Florida Holocaust Museum, who pointed out that Prescott Bushderived a portion of his personal fortune from his affiliation with a Nazi-controlledbank. Loftus, a former prosecutor in the Justice Department's Nazi War CrimesUnit, confirmed that Prescott Bush was a principal in the Union BankingCorporation in Manhattan in the late 1930s and the 1940s, and that leading Naziindustrialists secretly owned the bank at the time. He said they were movingmoney into the UBC through a second bank in Holland even after the United Statesdeclared war on Germany. The bank was liquidated in 1951, Loftus said, andPresident Bush's grandfather and great-grandfather received $1.5 million as part ofthat dissolution. He said he had a file of paperwork linking the bank and PrescottBush to Nazi money. \"That's where the Bush family fortune came from: it camefrom the Third Reich,\" Loftus said in a speech during the Sarasota ReadingFestival.' In his book,Unholy Trinity: The Vatican, The Nazis and the Swiss Banks,Loftus documented the Swiss bank accounts that harboured funds confiscated fromconcentration camp victims, and the involvement of Italian priests in smugglingNazi war criminals to safe havens in Canada, Central and South America, and theUnited States after the war. This is also detailed inAnd The Truth Shall Set You Free,which, like Loftus, exposes the Nazi connections of other prominent AmericanIlluminati families, most notably the Rockefellers and the Kennedys. One memberof the audience who heard Loftus in Florida, Nancy Krauss from Punta Gorda, said:\"I am absolutely shocked. 1 wish this would have come out before the election. Myhusband voted for Bush. I don't think he would have voted for him if he would"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Alice inWonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•The Bush family crime35have known.\"' If people knew what the Bush family had really done, and are stilldoing, they would all be in jail with the key hurled into a very deep ocean.Funding the Russian RevolutionThe Harrimans and their close associate, Prescott Bush, also helped to fund theRussian Revolution. E. Roland Harriman was the brother of W. Averill Harriman(Skull and Bones Society), who was a director of a company called the GuarantyTrust when it was financing Lenin and Trotsky to trigger the Russian Revolution(another Illuminati problem-reaction-solution). Half the board members of BrownBrothers Harriman and their fellow Russian Revolution financers, J.P. Morgan, wereSkull and Bones initiates. Roland Harriman, Prescott Bush and Percy Rockefeller,were in the same Bonesmen group. Averill Harriman, the Henry Kissinger of hisday, would later make vast profits from Russian ventures and be appointed USAmbassador to the Soviet Union to advance Illuminati interests there. The US andSoviet governments were on different \"sides\" in the \"Cold War\"? Sure they were. Itwas all a game to dupe the people. Averill Harriman was also a controlling voice inthe Democratic Party and dictator to President Franklin Roosevelt, he of the drug-running Illuminati bloodline related to the Bushes. Harriman's wife, Pamela, whodied while US ambassador to Paris in 1997, was extremely influential in BillClinton's rise to the presidency, which is why he made her Ambassador to France asa pay back. In turn, her husband, Averill, a \"Democrat\", was very much a mentor toPrescott Bush and the Bush family in general, who are \"Republicans\". As oneheadline at the time of Bill Clinton's run for president put it: \"Bush Camp FinancesClinton Campaign\".' Like I say, the United States, as with the UK and othercountries, is a one-party state masquerading as a free society. Whoever you vote forthe government still gets in: the Illuminati government. Pamela Harriman was alsomarried to Randolph Churchill, son of Britain's wartime Prime Minister, WinstonChurchill (bloodline and cousin to Franklin Roosevelt) and she had affairs with theItalian Fiat boss Giovanni Agnelli (bloodline and major Illuminati major operative)and Baron Elie de Rothschild (bloodline and Illuminati operative), among a stringof others.When you move in Illuminati circles, it is a very small world.George H.W. Bush - \"Father George\"This was the background into which George Herbert Walker Bush arrived in thisworld on June 12th 1924. He was groomed from birth to serve the Illuminati in along list of roles, including US Ambassador to the United Nations, Chairman of theRepublican Party at the time of the Watergate hearings, Director of the CIA, andVice President and President of the United States. The Herbert Walker in his namecomes from his grandfather, George Herbert Walker (Skull and Bones Society),another man heavily involved with Prescott Bush in the manipulation of theRussian Revolution, the expansion of the eugenics movement and the funding ofHitler. The golf trophy called the Walker Cup is named after him. Wherever youlook in George Bush's life you find Illuminati operatives, human sacrificers, childabusers and orchestrators of genocide. George Bush himself is all of these, as my"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"36\tThis \"world\"isonly an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just achoiceright now between fear and love.books and others have well detailed. Father George is very much a power behindthe throne during the presidency of his son, who is only doing what others tell him.Iwill summarise here just a few of the crimes against humanity inflicted byFather George Bush and his dominant partner, Henry Kissinger, another genocidalmaniac. It will give you a flavour of the true mentality behind September 11th andthe subsequent \"war on terrorism\". Bush served the Illuminati in China whileKissinger and the Chinese were supporting Pol Pot in the genocidal war onCambodia that led to the systematic extermination of millions of Cambodians. Bushreturned home in 1975 when he received a telegram from Kissinger saying that hewas being nominated by President Ford (Kissinger in other words) to be Director ofthe CIA. Bush held the post in 1976 and 1977 and he is so fundamentally involvedin CIA activities to this day that in 1999 its headquarters compound at Langley,Virginia, was named the George Bush Center for Intelligence. Maybe his son shouldjoin, he could do with some. The Central Intelligence Agency is part of the so-called\"Inner Fed\" of the secret government that consists of the CIA, the National SecurityAgency, FBI, NASA and the Federal Reserve \"Central Bank of America\". It isthrough \"umbrella\" structures like the \"Inner Fed\" - the pyramids - that acoordinated policy and response can be conducted between apparentlyunconnected agencies and organisations. Much of the funding of this cartel ofmanipulation comes from its involvement in the drugs trade, which the intelligenceagencies and bloodline families like the Bushes control.Father George Bush was not new to the intelligence game and his connectionswith the CIA would appear to go back to the 1950s or even much earlier given theSkull and Bones Society connection to the US intelligence community. InTheImmaculate Deception,'Russell S. Bowen names Bush as a top CIA agent since beforethe agency's failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba on April 17th 1961, which turnedPresident Kennedy's attention to reforming the CIA. Bowen, a retired brigadiergeneral who did some of the Bush family's dirty work, says that Bush worked witha man named Felix Rodriguez and other anti-Castro Cubans.' Intriguingly, the topsecret code name of the Bay of Pigs invasion was \"Operation Zapata\". Bush's oilcompany was called Zapata Oil. Rodriguez would turn up again in the Iran-Contraarms-for-drugs scandal during the Reagan-Bush administration, which made vastquantities of hard drugs available to the young people of the United States. Whenyou look at the personnel in the \"Plumbers Group\" involved in the Watergatebreak-in in 1972, a remarkable number of them were also involved in the Bay ofPigs debacle. William Buckley, a CIA coordinator, said that if he told what he knewabout the Bay of Pigs and. the Kennedy assassination \"it would be the biggestscandal ever to rock the nation\".\" Buckley would later be assassinated in theMiddle East. There is plenty of evidence that George Bush was a long-time CIAasset since before the Kennedy assassination when the family friend and Hitlersupporter, Allen Dulles, was head of the CIA. The Dulles family are bloodline andcousins to the Rockefellers. President Kennedy sacked Allen Dulles in a purge inwhich JFK threatened to break up the CIA into a thousand pieces, but before hecould do that he was assassinated in Dealey Plaza, Dallas, in 1963 and the same"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•The Bush (amity come37Allen Dulles was appointed to the Warren Commission to decide who killed him!There is evidence to suggest that George Bush was far closer to the Kennedyassassination than people have believed.\"Father George at the CIAFrom his office at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, Bush put together histeam. Among them was the infamous Theodore Shackley, whom Bush named as theCIA's associate deputy director for covert operations. Shackley had been the head. ofthe CIA station in Miami during the early 1960s, from where E. Howard Hunt andhis fellow Watergate burglars would emerge. Shackley went on to head the CIAstation in Saigon during the Vietnam War where he masterminded OperationPhoenix. This involved the death of tens of thousands of Vietnamese civilians whowere \"suspected\" of working for the Viet-Cong. (Just being able to read and writewas enough to invite this suspicion, apparently.) Oliver North, the \"star\" of theIran-Contra affair, worked with Shackley on Operation Phoenix, which is reputed tohave murdered 40,000 Vietnamese villagers. Shackley ran a huge assassination anddrug operation in South-East Asia in the 1970s in which two other Bush men,Donald Gregg and Felix Rodriguez, were involved. This operation was threatenedby President Kennedy seeking to withdraw from Vietnam, the Illuminati war thatcost the lives of 50,000 Americans and two million Vietnamese. Bush appointed thesame Theodore Shackley to an important position in his CIA and Shackley wouldlater be recruited as Bush's speechwriter during the 1979-80 election campaign. Theidea that someone like Shackley would be hired to write Bush's speeches defies theimagination. No doubt his other \"talents\" were the real reason for his presence. Thelast I heard, Shackley was living in Medellin, Columbia, home of the drug cartel.How thoroughly appropriate. Thomas Clines, a former second in command at theCIA station in Miami, was another Bush appointee at the CIA who would beinvolved in Iran-Contra, a scandal Bush was to say he knew nothing about.During Bush's tenure at the CIA, the operatives knew they could do virtually asthey liked because their Director had a gift for looking the other way. The powerover the US intelligence operations was concentrated in Bush's hands as a result of aseries of measures introduced by President Ford, a front man for the mob and anabuser of mind-controlled women (seeThe Biggest SecretandTrance-Formation OfAmerica).In the words of theNew York Times,Ford: \"...centralized more power in thehands of the Director of Central Intelligence than any had had since the creation ofthe CIA\".` Among Bush's CIA operatives in South America was the infamous Nazi\"Butcher of Lyon\", Klaus Barbie, who had escaped from Europe thanks to US(Illuminati) intelligence. It was he who masterminded the so-called \"cocaine-coup\"in Bolivia in June 1980 and he used the profits from CIA-supported drug networks tofinance the neo-Nazi overthrow of the government in Argentina when, according toformer US Drug Enforcement agent, Mike Levine, the coup was achieved by troopswearing Nazi armbands.\" Another Illuminati front operation closely connected toBush is Sun Myung Moon's \"Moonie Church\", which is connected to manyprominent politicians around the world, including Ted Heath, the former Prime"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"38\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.Minister of the UK from 1970 to 74 (SeeThe Biggest SecretandChildren Of The Matrix).Bo Hi Pak, Moon's right-hand man, was among the first to arrive in La Paz after theBarbie-Bush \"cocaine-coup\" in Bolivia. Moon, it is claimed, invested $4 million in thecoup and was to massively finance Bush's run for the presidency in 1988. TheWashington Times newspaper, so supportive of Bush, is owned by the Moonies.14The contacts George Bush made at the CIA would be invaluable when hebecame Vice President to Ronald Reagan on January 21st 1981. Reagan's personalfortune dates from a time shortly after becoming Governor of California when hebought some land cheaply and sold it at a vast profit to a group of benefactors whohave never been publicly identified.\" Reagan, a former B-movie actor, was a long-time member of Bohemian Grove and an initiate of the Knights of Malta. This isanother a very significant strand in the Illuminati web. Reagan was 70, the oldestman to be inaugurated as President. His mind was failing and he needed longafternoon naps each day. Almost everything Reagan said, even in relatively off-the-cuff situations when greeting foreign leaders, was written for him on cue cards byhis aides. George Bush was president in all, but name. After the assassinationattempt on Reagan in 1981, his mind further deteriorated. This gave Bush almostcomplete control of affairs and in the background was the power behind the throne:his mentor, Henry Kissinger. Reagan's would-be assassin, John Hinckley, hadconnections to the Bush family. Father George built a network of organisationswithin the government with himself at the head. These were the Standing Crisis,Pre-Planning Group, the Crisis Management Center, the Terrorist Incident WorkingGroup, the Task Force on Combating Terrorism and the Operations Sub-Group.These were subordinate to, and controlled by, the Special Situation Group chairedby Bush. If ever there was a line-up of problem-reaction-solution \"organisations\",then this was it. Through this network would come the arms-for-drugs operationknown as Iran-Contra in which the Reagan-Bush administration illegally sold armsto the hostile regime in Iran (hostile in public anyway) and used the money theyreceived to illegally fund and arm the Contra terrorists in Nicaragua who werefighting to overthrow the elected Sandinista government that the Illuminati wantedremoved. In return for this vital support, the Contras supplied US governmentagencies controlled by George Bush with drugs for distribution on the streets ofAmerica and elsewhere.Iran-contraThe now Vice President Bush hired his former CIA associate, Donald P. Gregg, ashis main adviser on \"national security\" and Gregg brought with him a \"former\"CIA assassinations manager, Felix Rodriguez, whom Bush had known back to thetime of the Bay of Pigs invasion and his period as head of the CIA. Gregg andRodriguez were involved with Theodore Shackley in the assassination and drug-running operation in South-East Asia in the Vietnam War era. The two nowworked out of George Bush's office! It was strictly illegal under US law for thegovernment to supply arms to Iran or to fund and arm the Nicaraguan \"freedomfighters\" (terrorists) called the Contras in their war with the Sandinista"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•The Bush family crime\t39government. It was certainly illegal to accept payment with drugs in return. TheReagan-Bush administration would do all of these things. One of the ways theBush-controlled \"Reagan\" government secretly undermined the Sandinistas wasby mining harbours in Nicaragua. A company called Continental Shelf Associates,Inc.,which is based on Jupiter Island, Florida, carried out these covert operations.Jupiter Island is an interesting place. It became the fiefdom of the Harriman set,including George Bush, who has a home there. Jupiter Island has been a base forgenerations of Illuminati families. Continental Shelf Associates (CSA) lists manyoil companies and government agencies among its clients. They include theRockefellers' Exxon and the Bush-connected oil company Pennzoil. CSA was usedby the US military for coastal mapping and reconnaissance in Grenada before theReagan-Bush invasion in October 1983 and during US operations in the Lebanon.The company was run by Robert \"Stretch\" Stevens. He was a close associate ofTheodore Shackley and Felix Rodriguez when they were all involved in South-EastAsia and the Bay of Pigs invasion. A CSA company at the same address is ActaNon Verba, which means \"action, not words\". A high-level CIA officer quoted byAnton Chaitkin and Webster Griffin Tarpley, inGeorge Bush, The UnauthorisedBiography,said of this CSA subsidiary:\"Assassination operations and training company controlled by Ted Shackley, undercover of a private corporation with a regular board of directors, stockholders, etc,located in Florida. They covertly bring in Haitian and South East Asian boat people asrecruits, as well as Koreans, Cubans, and Americans. They hire out assassination andintelligence services to governments, corporations, and individuals ...\"16Again, Father Bush's close friend Shackley is involved. The bombs planted in theharbours of Nicaragua caused such a row in the US that the laws against suchaction, the Boland Laws as they were called, were further strengthened. But at asecret meeting of the National Planning Group on June 25th 1984, Bush, Reagan andtheir top officials decided to ignore the law. They would fund the Contras throughHonduras, just as they had used El Salvador against the Sandinistas. Bush andOliver North, an official of the National Security Council, travelled together to ElSalvador. On January 18th 1985 the Bush-appointed Felix Rodriguez is known tohave met his name sake (but not thought to be a relative), Ramon Milian Rodriguez,an accountant and money launderer who worked for the Medellin drug cartel. Thismeeting was confirmed by Felix Rodriguez and reported in theMiami HeraldonJune 30th 1987. From his cell in Butner, North Carolina, Ramon told investigativejournalist,Martha Honey:...[Felix offered] ... in exchange for money for the Contra cause he would use hisinfluence in high places to get the [cocaine] cartel US goodwill ... Frankly, one of theselling points was that he could talk directly to Bush. The issue of goodwill wasn'tsomething that was going to go through 27 bureaucratic hands. It was something thatwas directly between him and Bush.\"17"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"40\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.This could easily be done given that Felix Rodriguez was working from Bush'soffice. A memo in early September 1986 sent to Oliver North by retired Army MajorGeneral John K. Singlaub, said that Rodriguez was talking of having \"daily contact\"with Bush's office and this, said the memo, could damage President Reagan and theRepublican Party. Oliver North would also write in his notebook: \"Felix has beentalking too much about the VP [Vice President]\".\" In her 1987 book,Out Of ControlformerCBS NewsProducer Leslie Cockburn presents devastating evidence ofBush's involvement in Iran-Contra and drug running. She says that planeschartered by the CIA and packed with cocaine flew directly into the Homestead AirForce Base in Florida using a CIA code signal. Colonel Albert Carone, who was latermurdered, said in a sworn statement that he remembered seeing Oliver North makemore than 20 entries in his diary detailing how drug profits were being used to buyweapons for the Contras. He said that an entry for July 5th 1985 noted that \"$14million to buy arms came from drugs\".19In 1986, the Reagan-Bush administration admitted that Adolfo \"Popo\"Chamorro's Nicaraguan Contras, the terrorists supported by the CIA, were helpinga Colombian drug-trafficker to transport drugs into the United States, and thetestimony of John Stockwell, a former high-ranking CIA official, revealed that drugsmuggling was an essential component of the CIA operation with the Contras.George Morales, one of South America's biggest traffickers, testified that he wasapproached in 1984 to fly weapons to the Contras. In return, he says, the CIAhelped him to smuggle thousands of kilos of cocaine into the United States via anairstrip on the ranch of John Hull, a self-confessed CIA agent and associate of OliverNorth. As Michael Ruppert, a former drugs specialist with the Los Angeles PoliceDepartment, said:\"The CIA and Ronald Reagan and [CIA Director] Bill Casey and Vice-President GeorgeBush were running the whole operation, we know that now. They circumvented the willof Congress and there was an explosion of drug trafficking all throughout CentralAmerica, coordinated by the CIA.\"20Meanwhile, the other aspect of Iran-Contra was continuing to illegally tradearms for hostages with Iran. Oliver North was heavily involved in the supply ofarms to Iran, via Israel, in return for hostages. The release of the hostages wasexplained in part by the efforts of Terry Waite, the representative of Britain'sArchbishop of Canterbury. Waite was being used without his knowledge by Northwho was quite happy for him to take the credit for the release of hostages when, infact, they were the result of illegal arms sales. As a consequence, Waite wouldeventually be taken hostage himself. Throughout all of this, George Bush wastelling the American people: \"We will make no concessions to terrorists\" - just ashis son is saying today. Even before Reagan was elected, Bush negotiated with theIranians to delay the release of American hostages until after the Presidentialelection of 1980 to ensure that the sitting tenant, Jimmy Carter, would not get thekudos before polling day. So well was this negotiated that 52 hostages flew out of"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre DisasterThe Bush family crime\t41Iran on the day that Reagan was inaugurated after 444 days in captivity. Thisbecame known as October Surprise and no doubt the promise of arms sales to Iranby a future Reagan-Bush administration was fundamental to the deal. I know itshard for us to imagine anyone coldly ensuring that American hostages wouldspend months longer in captivity just to serve Bush's political agenda, but that's thementality we are dealing with here - the same mentality that is behind September11th and its aftermath.In late 1986, the Iran-Contra scandal blew and Ronald Reagan had to admitsome, but only some, of what was happening. He said: \"A few months ago I toldthe American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my bestintentions still tell me that is true but the facts and evidence tell me it is not.\"(I lied.)On October 5th a plane left the Ilopango Air Base in El Salvador with arms andammunition for the Contra terrorists in Nicaragua. The flight had been coordinatedby officials within George Bush's office. As the plane came low to make the drop, itwas grounded by a Sandinista missile. Three people died in the crash, but cargohandler Eugene Hasenfus parachuted into the hands of the Sandinistas. Bush wasalerted in a call to his office by drug-runner and assassin Felix Rodriguez. The truthwas out. Or some of it was. The power of the Illuminati network can be the onlyexplanation for how, despite the overwhelming evidence against him, Bush evadedprosecution even though Buz Sawyer, the pilot of the crashed plane, was found tohave the private phone number of George Bush's office in his pocket! Hasenfus alsostated that George Bush knew about the whole thing. But Bush denied anyinvolvement or knowledge of what happened, and subordinates like Donald Regan,Admiral John Poindexter, Oliver North, Robert McFarlane, and Major GeneralRichard Secord, were sacrificed and scapegoated. They were very much involved,of that there is no doubt, but Bush got away with it, as did Reagan and his Secretaryof Defense Casper Weinberger. North, who was up to his eyes in the intrigue, facedhearings with other scapegoats and staggeringly emerged in the eyes of many as anAmerican hero. On March 16th 1988 a Federal Grand Jury indicted North,Poindexter and others on charges that included conspiracy to defraud the USgovernment. A year later, despite delays due to legal manoeuvring, North wasconvicted of three of the twelve criminal counts that came to court. He was fined$150,000 and was given a three-year suspended prison sentence. Poindexter, theReagan-Bush National Security Adviser, was convicted on five counts of deceivingCongress and was jailed for six months. But both convictions would be set asidebecause it was claimed their testimony to Congress, for which they were givenimmunity, was unfairly used against them. Robert McFarlane, Poindexter'spredecessor as National Security Adviser, admitted criminal charges of withholdinginformation from Congress about the covert support for the Contras. He was fined$20,000 and given two years' probation. Others involved, like CIA Director WilliamCasey, had \"health problems\". In the aftermath of the Iran-Contra revelations,Casey literally could not speak following an operation for a \"brain tumour\" thattook away his ability to talk. Two months later he was dead. During his presidentialelection campaign, Bush pledged to build a \"kinder, gentler, America\". In July 19911"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"42\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.Alan D. Fiers Jr, the head of CIA covert operations in Central America between 1984and 1986, admitted lying to Congress about the CIA's involvement in the scandal.The Tower Commission was appointed to investigate Iran-Contra and was chairedby Bush's friend, the Texas Senator John Tower. Also on the Commission were BrentScowcroft, a Kissinger \"yes man\" and an executive of the Illuminati front, KissingerAssociates, and Ed Muskie, Ronald Reagan's Attorney General and a close friendsince his days as Governor of California. Muskie was himself implicated in Iran-Contra. As you can see, the Commission was thoroughly independent and,predictably, cleared Father George Bush of all blame and involvement. When Bushbecame President he made John Tower his Secretary of Defense. Reporters askedTower if his appointment was a pay-off from Bush. His response:\"As the Commission was made up of three people, Brent Scowcroft and Ed Muskie inaddition to myself, that would be sort of impugning the integrity of Brent Scowcroft andEd Muskie ... We found nothing to implicate the Vice President ... I wonder what kind ofpay-off they're going to get?\"21I can tell him. Bush appointed Brent Scowcroft as his National Security Adviser.The Senate refused to accept Tower's appointment and he began to speak of theinjustice he believed had been done to him. He died in a plane crash on April 5th1991.When the Senate turned down Tower, a decision Bush probably engineered,he selected Dick Cheney as Defense Secretary. Cheney was the senior Republicanmember of the House Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactionswith Iran and that also cleared Bush of involvement in Iran-Contra. Bush still had aproblem, however, with the former Defense Secretary Casper Weinberger, who wasindicted in 1992, with others, for lying to Congress over Iran-Contra. With hispresidency coming to an end, this could have been disastrous for Bush and hepardoned Weinberger and the others to ensure there would be no trial. The pardoncame on Christmas Eve 1992 in the dying days of his presidency after he had lostthe November election to Bill Clinton and a matter of weeks before Weinberger andcompany were due to face a trial that would have implicated Bush. In January 1993the presidency passed to Clinton who continued the cover-up because - as I exposeinAnd The Truth Shall Set You Free -he was also involved, not least with the Contradrug operations at the Mena airstrip in Arkansas where he was Governor. It isactually possible to coordinate a drug-running and arms-running operation fromthe White House and get away with it. Where were the media while all this wasgoing on? Licking arse as usual. One reporter, Gary Webb on theSan Jose MercuryNews,did have the guts to expose how the CIA and the Bush-controlled WhiteHouse had poured crack cocaine into black areas to raise money for the Contras anddestroy the black communities. When he did so, Webb and his newspaper were notonly attacked by the authorities, but by their fellow \"journalists\" and major paperslike theWashington Post, New York Times,andLos Angeles Times.How do thesepeople sleep at night?

The US response? Ineffect: \"Piss off.\" As with all playground bullies, United States governments, likethose in Britain, claim immunity from that which they impose upon others.The Gulf WarHere is another example of the mentality behind the \"war on terrorism\" that hasfollowed the atrocities of September 11th 2001. Today we have the Bush family inthe White House, Dick Cheney as Vice President and Colin Powell as Secretary ofState, and a United States international \"coalition\" goes to war in the Middle-NearEast. In 1991 the Bush family was in the White House, Cheney was DefenseSecretary and Powell was head of the US forces as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs ofStaff, and a United States international \"coalition\" went to war in the Middle East.The Gulf War, if you add together the casualties from the initial conflict in 1991 andthe sanctions and bombing that have followed, has cost the lives of more than amillion Iraqi children - and rising. Already the child and civilian casualties fromthe \"war on terrorism\" are mounting as more mass murder ensues from the samesource. Disputes between Iraq and Kuwait are not new. Kuwait has been underBritish and Illuminati control back to the days when the economic potential of oilwas discovered. Iraq has one of the world's largest oil deposits and attracts theconstant attention of the US and British elite. In fact, countries like Kuwait, Iraqand others in the Middle East, were created by the British and their fellowEuropean powers drawing lines in the sand. Kuwait is a dictatorship, anunpleasant one, and the idea that the Gulf War was to \"free\" Kuwait is justridiculous. If Kuwait is to be free, the dictators of the royal family elite need to giveup their power and the British and US manipulation of that country and its peoplemust end. Neither is in prospect because the way things are suits the Illuminatiagenda. Kuwait is a brutal dictatorship, as is (even more so) Saudi Arabia, anothercountry Father George Bush claimed to be protecting from the tyranny of SaddamHussein in 1991. But after the Gulf conflict what happened? Saddam was left inpower in Iraq and the Kuwaiti royal dictatorship was brought back with Americanand British support to continue their policy of the murder and torture of\"dissidents\" who campaign for little luxuries like freedom and a say in the runningof their own country.Saddam Hussein, the designated villain of the Gulf conflict, was in fact one ofthe gang, at least up to this point. He was a member of the elite Safari Club, whichbegan as a consortium involving Saddam, SAVAK (the secret police of the Shah ofIran), Anwar Sadat, the later-assassinated President of Egypt, and Saudi ArabianIntelligence. It has been implicated in countless coups in Africa to further its goalsand is heavily involved in arms trading and supply. Out of the Safari Club came thePinay Circle, or Le Cercle, named after the French Prime Minister Antoine Pinay. Hewas a major Illuminati asset who attended the first official meeting of the eliteBilderberg Group at Oosterbeek, Holland, in May 1954. Others involved with LeCercle included the Habsburg family, a major Illuminati bloodline.

In America, one of the Le Cercle fronts is alleged to be the CIA-backedHeritage Foundation in Washington. Look at the potential for such an organisationto be a coordinating force between apparently different agencies and countries toachieve a common aim. Le Cercle and the Safari Club are basically the same entity,which is why, as theWall Street Journalreported on August 16th 1990, it was the CIAthat supported the Baath Party in Iraq and installed Saddam Hussein as dictator in1968, just as they did with Colonel Gaddafi in Libya. But it is important toremember that everyone is expendable to the cause if it best serves the agenda.Saddam Hussein was encouraged by the Americans and the British to go to warwith the CIA/British Intelligence-imposed regime of the Ayatollah Khomeini inIran in 1980. The war dragged on for eight years amid appalling suffering and lossof life. But it was good for the oil, banking and armament cartel (all controlled bythe Illuminati), and for divide and rule. The British government armed both sides inthis conflict and some (but only some) of this scandal surfaced through the ScottInquiry into illegal arms sales to Iraq that reported in 1996. The Iran-Iraq War is agrotesque example of problem-reaction-solution. The CIA looked after Khomeiniduring his exile in Paris to ensure he was ready and waiting to take over when theShah, another CIA puppet, had outlived his usefulness. Now Saddam would beused again, knowingly or otherwise, to start another war in the Gulf by invadingKuwait. Author and researcher George C. Andrews reported:\"A little known fact about the Gulf War is that one month before our Declaration of Waron December 15, 1990, Secretary of State James Baker, signed the US Army Reportfrom the 352nd Civil Affairs Command on the New Kuwait [unclassified, and thereforeavailable to those interested]. This report describes in detail how extensively Kuwait willbe destroyed, how the oil wells will be set on fire, and then how it will all be rebuilt'better than before', with despotism, instead of democracy, even more entrenched thanit had been before.

The'blind trust', by the way, is the farce that insists that presidents must hand over alltheir business dealings to a \"trust\" during their term in office. This is supposed toensure they can't make political decisions that affect their own investments andcompanies. Yeah, sounds credible. Bush's 'blind trust' was controlled by his closefriend William S. Farish III, the grandson of William Farish, the President ofStandard Oil New Jersey when they were working with Hitler's chemical and drugcartel I.G. Farben, which ran the slave camp at Auschwitz. While William Farishwas head of Standard Oil, it was supplying the Nazis through Switzerland duringthe war, as established by official inquiries. Today his grandson and Bush \"trustmanager\", William S. Farish III, is the American Ambassador to the UnitedKingdom as Boy George Bush conducts his \"war on terrorism\" in conjunction withTony Blair's British government. William Farish III is also a very close associate ofQueen Elizabeth II and she keeps some of her breeding mares at his Lane's EndFarm, near Versailles in Kentucky, where she has been a regular visitor.\" (Thedetailed background to the involvement of the British royal family with theIlluminati can be found inThe Biggest Secret.)Anyway, back to the Gulf War, or Gulf Slaughter as it really was. Americanreconnaissance advised George Bush around July 16th and 17th 1990 that Iraqitroops were assembling along the border with Kuwait (or so the official story goes).Nothing was done. On July 25th Saddam Hussein met with the US ambassador inBaghdad, April Glaspie, who told him she was acting on the instructions ofPresident Bush. She said the Bush government had \"no opinion on the Arab-Arabconflict like your border disagreement with Kuwait\". Glaspie added that she hadinstructions from the President to seek better relations with Iraq. She then left for asummer holiday, another indication to Saddam that the Americans were notinterested in the whole thing.24While all of this was going on, Bush still had nothingto say in public about the troop build-ups along the Kuwaiti border. By July 31stperhaps 100,000 troops were involved. Still Bush was silent. Two days before theinvasion, John Kelly, an assistant Secretary of State, was asked by a congressionalhearing if the US would defend Kuwait in the event of an attack. He replied: \"Wehave no defence treaty with any Gulf country.\"25On August 2nd Saddam invadedKuwait. Henry Kissinger was operating behind the scenes in the form of BrentScowcroft, the National Security Adviser, a long-time Kissinger aide back to thedays of the Nixon Presidency and an executive of Kissinger Associates. Scowcroftwas urging military intervention and the Bush tone began to change. The UnitedStates told the Saudi Arabians that Saddam was likely to invade their country next- utter claptrap - and Bush ordered US troops to assemble along the \"threatened\"Saudi border. There would be no intervention, the world was told. The US forceswere only there to protect Saudi Arabia, Bush said, and economic sanctions were tobe the weapon used against Saddam. The Saudi Arabians, Germans and Japanesewere pressured into contributing large sums towards American costs.But sanctions were never going to be the real weapon and the rhetoric becameever stronger. Bush labelled Saddam \"the new Hitler\" and said that the Second"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"46\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.World War had shown that appeasement of such people was not the answer. Hemight have added that it is also not the answer to fund both sides in a conflict andto help finance Hitler's war machine, as his father had done. For those who knewthe game plan, it was easy to see what was happening. On August 23rd Kissinger'sman, Brent Scowcroft, said it all: \"We believe we are creating the beginning of aNew World Order out of the collapse of the US-Soviet antagonisms.\"26New WorldOrder is a very old code name for the Illuminati global agenda. The term would beused by Bush in a speech to Congress on September 11th 1990 and enter intopolitical speak around the world to the point of tedium. He described his NewWorld Order as \"diverse nations drawn together in common cause\". Lose thenewspeak and this translates as world government, central bank, army andcurrency controlled by a Big Brother dictatorship - the very structure that 9 / 11brought so much closer. Bush received enthusiastic support for his war against Iraqfrom Illuminati puppets Margaret Thatcher and Francois Mitterand, the 33rddegree Freemason and President of France, who had supported the Nazis duringtheir occupation of his country. Both sent forces to the Gulf alongside theAmericans and the Illuminati \"coalition\" was presented as a United Nationsresponse. Bush said in that speech to Congress on September 11th 1990 - exactly 11years to the day before 9/11:\"Clearly no longer can a dictator count on East-West confrontation to stymie concertedUnited Nations action against aggression. A new partnership of nations has begun, andwe stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment. The crisis in the Persian Gulf, asgrave as it is, also offers a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period ofcooperation. Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective - a new world order - canemerge ...\"27For \"fifth\" read \"first\" and, of course, this is a mirror of the rhetoric we have hadto endure since the attacks on the World Trade Center. Father Bush announced onNovember 8th 1990 that the forces in Saudi Arabia would be substantiallyincreased. The \"defensive\" force was now to switch to offensive mode. A week laterBush left on a tour of Europe and the Middle East gathering support for theinvasion. He met for three hours with the late President Assad of Syria, another toolof the Illuminati, who pledged to increase his contribution to Bush's forces to 20,000men. The Bush \"UN\" forces attacked on Wednesday, January 16th 1991. 120,000 airsorties were unleashed on Iraq, mostly, it turned out, against civilian areas. Theoperation was headed by Bush's Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell,who has ancestral links with many old American and British families. The numberof dead and injured from the bombing of Iraq, the resulting disease and thecontinuing economic sanctions can hardly be comprehended. Conditions for theinnocent civilians in Iraq are unimaginable under the economic stranglehold thathas been imposed since the Gulf War. This is the United Nations in all its glory. It isnot the promoter of freedom, peace, and justice, as its PR proclaims, it is anIlluminati stalking horse for global government. By the way, part of the propaganda"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•The Bush family crime\t47to gain political and public support for the invasion of Iraq was the \"evidence\"given to the Senate by a teenage girl that Iraqi soldiers had thrown Kuwaiti babiesfrom their incubators and sent the incubators to Baghdad. Later it emerged that theteenager was in fact the daughter of the Kuwait Ambassador to Washington and thewhole story was a lie cooked up by public relations firm Hill and Knowlton.2\"How Bush funded SaddamThe public were also not told that it was the Bush government that had armed andfunded the very army of Saddam Hussein that Father George had now sent UStroops to fight. Much of the funding was channelled through a branch of Italy'sBanca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) in Atlanta. Congressman Henry Gonzalesexposed the BNL scandal in 1991 after he noticed that this little branch of the Italiangovernment bank had loaned Iraq $5billion.This money was dispatched to Saddamafter November 1989 when the Bush White House guaranteed bank loans to Iraq ifthey were to be used for the purchase for US farm products. If Saddam defaulted,the US taxpayers picked up the tab for the loan and, since he was always defaulting,that was obviously going to be the outcome from the start. As planned, Saddamspent the money on arms, including purchases from the Matrix Churchill machinetool company in England. This company was the subject of a court case in which theBritish government was implicated. Although many US investigators warned Bushthat the money was being used for arms, the loans were allowed to continue. Theaim was obvious when you look at the other evidence. Bush was doing the same ashis father did with Hitler. He was funding an aggressor so he could start a war withhim. Some of the money given to Saddam by Bush was spent on buying poison gasfrom a CIA front called Cardeon Industries in Chile.\" When the war started,Saddam defaulted on the loans and the US taxpayers footed the bill for Iraq to fighttheir own sons and daughters. The cover-up of this, as usual, led to the targeting ofthe small fry. The whole thing was blamed on the bank manager at the BNL'sAtlanta branch, Christopher P. Drogoul, who could never have sanctioned that sortof money without the highest authorisation. One of the network of Illuminatiprivate \"armies\" is called the Wackenhut Corporation and investigative journalistJohn Connolly exposed in aSpyMagazinearticle\" that Wackenhut had beeninvolved in the arming of Iraq before the Gulf War by transporting the means toproduce the very chemical weapons that Father George Bush and Co were sayingposed such a threat to the world. George Wackenhut, a former FBI operative,started the company with other FBI associates in 1954 and its board has beenpacked over the years with recruits from the FBI, CIA and the military. It has sincemerged with Group 4 Falck, the world's second largest provider of SecurityServices. George Wackenhut is a long-time friend of Father George Bush and hascontributed generously to his political campaigns and those of Boy George andFlorida governor Jeb Bush. John Connolly wrote that:\"...After a six-month investigation, in the course of which we spoke to more than 300people, we believe we know that the [Wackenhut] truck did contain equipment"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"48\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.necessary for the manufacture of chemical weapons and where it was headed [in theWinter of 1990]: to Saddam Hussein's Iraq. And the Wackenhut Corporation - a publiclytraded company with strong ties to the CIA and federal contracts worth $200 million ayear - was making sure Saddam would be getting his equipment intact.\"31A guy called Peter Kawaja said in an American radio interview that he wasinvolved at one time with Product Ingredient Technology in Boca Raton and withIshan Barbouti International (IBI), the builder of Pharma 150, the chemical andbiological weapons complex in Rabta, Libya .32His experiences led him toinvestigate what was going on. He said he went to the CIA and FBI, and operatedfor the US government under a code name because they told him these people wereinternational terrorists and that they were going to prosecute them. Kawaja saidthat he did his own investigation, however, which included \"bugging telephonelines, buildings, and certain other locations throughout the United States\". He saidhe intercepted communications to the Commodity Credit Corporation and theBanca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL). Kawaja said he saw the letters of credit of theBNL, which came from Switzerland, and \"a lot of other communications regardingthe Gulf War that was to come.\" He said he recorded calls going to and comingfrom Baghdad, to and from the United States and London, CIA, FBI, FBI counter-intelligence, US Customs, certain politicians, and numerous other individuals. \"Thisismy information,\" he said in the radio interview. \"It is not second-hand.\" USDistrict Judge Marvin Shoob said the claim that the Atlanta branch of the BNLcould loan $5 billion to Iraq without the approval of the head office in Rome couldonly come out of \"never-never land\". The judge said that manager Drogoul andfour other employees at the branch:..were pawns or bit players in a far larger and wider ranging sophisticated conspiracythat involved BNL-Rome and possibly large American and foreign corporations and thegovernments of the United States, England, Italy and Iraq ... smoke is coming out ofevery window. I have to conclude that the building is on fire.\"33This is the last thing the Father Bush administration and the Illuminati wanted tohear. Judge Shoob was removed from the case and replaced by Judge ErnestTidwell, who refused to allow any evidence to be presented about the CIA and theBush-White House involvement in the bank. Drogoul was persuaded to pleadguilty even though he wasn't. The funding of the Iraqi arms build-up before theGulf War involved the Bush administration, the British government, the Italiangovernment, the Soviet Union and other leading governments controlled by theIlluminati. It also involved another familiar name, Henry Kissinger. As early as 1984his company Kissinger Associates was arranging for loans from the BNL to Iraq tofinance its arms purchases from a little-known subsidiary of Fiat, which was headedby major Illuminati initiate Giovanni Agnelli. Charles Barletta, a former justiceDepartment investigator, was quoted about this in the USSpotlightnewspaper onNovember 9th 1992. The report said:"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•The Bush family crime\t49\"Barletta added that Federal probers had collected dozens of such incriminating casehistories about the Kissinger firm. But Henry Kissinger seems to possess a kind ofimmunity. I'm not sure how he does it, but Kissinger wields as much power over theWashington National Security bureaucracy now as in the days when he was the Nixonadministration's foreign policy czar. He gets the pay-off; others get the blame. Kissingerwill remain unscathed until Congress finds the courage to convene a full-dressinvestigation into this Teflon power broker.\"Home of the brave ..It is appropriate to focus on the Gulf War before we proceed to 9/11 and the \"waron terrorism\", for these are mirrors of each other. Same people, same agenda, samemethods, same mass slaughter of the innocent. Firstly, as with Afghanistan, the GulfWar wasn't exactly a war. My understanding of a \"war\" is that you need two sides,and under that definition, the Gulf War was not a \"war\". It was the militaryequivalent of putting Mike Tyson in the ring with your granny. American soldiershave described this \"war\" as a \"turkey shoot\", which is precisely what it was. TheIraqi army, mainly conscripts who had no choice, may have been armed by the USand Britain, but it was still like trying to stop an elephant with a pop gun. Iraqimen, women and children were subjected to the most intense bombing blitz inhuman history. Hundreds of thousands died in the bombardment and while themedia were showing us pictures provided by the US military of \"smart bombs\" thatcould target a building and go through a toilet window, the truth that was beingsuppressed daily by the military censors was very different. At least 93% of thebombs that rained from the Iraqi skies were not \"smart\" and that's according to thePentagon's own numbers, and 70% of them missed their target. Wade Frazier'sexcellent study of the Gulf \"War\" reveals the background to just one of the devicesused against the Iraqi people:\"The [fuel-air] bomb works thus: there are two detonations; the first spreads a fine mistof fuel into the air, turning the area [about the size of a football field] into an explosivemix of vast proportion; then a second detonation ignites the mixture, causing anawesome explosion. The explosion is about the most powerful 'conventional' explosionwe know of.\"At a pressure shock of up to 200 pounds per square inch (PSI), people in itsdetonation zone are often killed by the sheer compression of the air around them.Human beings can typically withstand up to about a 40-PSI shock. The bomb sucksoxygen out of the air, and can apparently even suck the lungs out through the mouths ofpeople unfortunate enough to be in the detonation zone. Our military used it onhelpless people [in the 1991 Gulf Slaughter].\"34These were the same weapons used in Afghanistan. The Iraqi people, living,breathing, human beings like you and me, were also subjected to a lovely piece of"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"50\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.hardware called a \"Big Blue\", which produces a shock wave only eclipsed bynuclear weapons. As Wade Frazier points out, the power of the shock wave canturn a body into a hamburger. So-called \"bouncing bombs\" were also deployed.These are designed to \"bounce\" to waist height before exploding and ensure abetter chance of splattering people into a thousand pieces. These are called \"anti-personnel\" weapons in the sanitised \"newspeak\" of the Illuminati front men. Thenthere was (and is) the \"Beehive\", which explodes 8,800 pieces of razor-edgedshrapnel in all directions, cutting through a human body like the proverbial knifethrough butter. All these weapons were used against civilian men, women andchildren in the Gulf \"War\" and all the others since, including the \"war onterrorism\". In an oh so rare excursion into reality by the media, John Balzar of theLos Angeles Timesreported in 1991 on the fate of Iraqi conscripts. He saw night-vision \"gun sight\" footage from the briefing room:\"They looked like ghostly sheep flushed from a pen - Iraqi infantrymen bewildered andterrified, jarred from sleep and fleeing their bunkers under a hellish fire. One by one,they were cut down by attackers they could not see or understand. Some were blown tobits by bursts of 30-millimeter exploding cannon shells. One man dropped, writhed onthe ground, then struggled to his feet; another burst of fire tore him apart ... Evenhardened soldiers hold their breath as the Iraqi soldiers, as big as football players onthe television screen, run with nowhere to hide. These are not bridges exploding orairplane hangers. These are men.\"The same reporter wrote:\"The mechanics of death and destruction are a grim affair. The military's scientificapproach and its philosophies - for example, its preference for wounding vital organsover blowing off limbs - can be deeply disquieting to anybody who imagines suchmatters are left to chance. Many people would rather not know about the gruesomedetails\".35\"Nuke 'em, kill 'em all\"This was not a war, it was a mass slaughter by the very forces and controllers whoare now waging a \"war on terrorism\" against anyone they choose to demonisethrough their pathetic media. These protectors of \"freedom\" and \"liberty\" used thesame rhetoric then as they do now to justify the mass bombing of civilians. Theyhide this truth because of the lies so eagerly repeated by journalists who insult ourintelligence and a public that has long forgotten, not only what to think, but evenhow to. Then, as now, no dissent was allowed against the genocide of the innocentby the criminally insane. Talk show hosts, without two brain cells acting in unison,called for nuclear attacks on Iraq and anyone who challenged the \"war\" was eitherstupid or a supporter of evil. While the sheeple followed the fox, or Fox, the USgovernment and their British allies were targeting civilian bomb shelters, killing"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•The Bush family crime\t51hundreds of fathers, mothers and children because \"Intelligence told us that thebomb shelter was actually a military headquarters\". Bullshit. These are the sameidiots (or coldly calculated killers more like) who bombed a town in Afghanistan aweek after the Taliban had left! What people need to realise is that US surveillancesatellites can read your car number plate from space; and look at how theAirmanmagazine described the capabilities of the Global Hawk unmanned surveillanceplane deployed in Afghanistan:\"On an early test, for example, Global Hawk flew at 56,000 feet over the Naval WeaponsCenter at China Lake, California. The images it gathered were so clear that an electro-optical image stands out next to an F/A-18 fighter. An infrared image showed whereconcrete had cooled down from the shadow of a C-130 that had recently taken off.\"36So there are no \"mistakes\" about who or what is located in a bomb shelter. It iscold-blooded murder. For the same reason there are no \"mistakes\" in the failure, atleast officially, to establish the location of Osama bin Laden during the invasion ofAfghanistan. Reporter Peter Arnett of CNN visited the civilian bomb shelter in Iraqand found it was ... a bomb shelter. He also visited a milk factory bombed becauseitwas a \"chemical weapons factory\" and found it was ... a milk factory. In fact hehad been there a year before and it was producing ... milk.The Highway of DeathOn the ground thousands of Iraqi soldiers were buried alive as \"UN\" forces usedbulldozers to fill in their trenches in fundamental contravention of internationallaw. But nothing sums up the mentality of these deeply sick people currentlywaging the \"war on terrorism\" better than the almost unimaginable attacks on the\"Highway of Death\". The Iraqi army was in retreat in the wake of the airbombardment and headed out of Kuwait across the border to Basra. With themwere civilians andprisoners. USpilots attacked the vehicles at the front and back ofthe seven-mileretreatinghuman convoy, so forcing it to a standstill on the openroad. They then systematically bombed the convoy, constantly racing back to theiraircraft carrier to re-arm and return to continue the mass murder. As one pilot said,itwas like \"shooting fish in a barrel\" and thousands died at the hands of the verypeople who now \"fight terrorism\" and promote themselves as morally superior tothose they target. Barry McCaffrey, one of the generals involved in this massmurder, was later appointed by President Clinton to head his \"war on drugs\". Yet,as he conducted these crimes against humanity, Father George Bush's approvalratings soared, just as they did for his son when he continued the long, long, familyassociation with human genocide. The blatant defiance of the Geneva Conventionon the Highway of Death produced no action against the Bush administrationbecause there is one law for America, Britain, France and Germany, etc., and a verydifferent one for those they choose to bomb, kill, and mutilate. An International WarCrimes Tribunal found President George Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle, DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney, Secretary of State James Baker, and military leaders Colin"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"52\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want.

These are the people who have the audacity to put others on trialfor war crimes, like the former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic.Dark knightsThe Illuminati Queen of England was most grateful to these genocidal maniacs,however, and she made Bush's military chiefs Colin Powell and \"Stormin\"' NormanSchwarzkopf, (the commander of Operation Desert Storm) Honorary Knights of theBritish Empire. Schwarzkopf has lied through his teeth about the \"mystery\" diseaseknown as Gulf War Syndrome that has afflicted veterans of that slaughter. Hisfather would have been proud of him. Norman Schwarzkopf senior had been animportant player in the British-American Intelligence coup called Operation AJAX,which removed the Iranian Prime Minister Dr Mohammad Mossadegh in 1953. TheIlluminati wanted him ousted after he nationalised oil production and removed theoil cartel's power over his people. The British bloodline Prime Minister WinstonChurchill was also behind the coup and Mossadegh was replaced by thedictatorship of the Shah of Iran who reversed the oil nationalisation (seeAnd TheTruth Shall Set You Free).It is rare for the Queen to give Honorary Knighthoods andother honours to people outside the Commonwealth, but those she has chosen readlike an Illuminati Who's Who. The titles are dubbed \"honorary\" because theAmerican Constitution forbids the acceptance of titles from the monarch of aforeign state without the permission of Congress. So few of these honours are givenbecause, as a British government official put it: \"One must not debase the currency.\"Iwonder if you think the following names debase the currency: George Bush, thepaedophile, child killer, mass murderer, Satanist and close friend of the Windsors,was made an Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, as was RonaldReagan, Bush's lapdog \"President\"; Henry Kissinger, the orchestrator of genocideon a monumental scale worldwide, was made Knight Commander of the Order ofSt Michael and St George at a ceremony at Windsor Castle; Brent Scowcroft, anexecutive of Kissinger Associates and top adviser to George Bush, was made anHonorary Knight of the British Empire; and Casper Weinberger, another Bush clonewho was charged with offences in the Iran-Contra arms scandal and pardoned byBush, is another Honorary Knight of the British Empire. After the September 11thatrocities, the insider mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, was appointed anHonorary Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire fordoing nothing more than the job he was paid handsomely to do. So why was hesuch a chosen one? For some more realistic background to \"hero\" Giuliani and hisactivities see the website of Robert Lederman, a street artist in New York and aregular columnist for theGreenwich Village Gazette.\"Burying the truthThe crimes for which the Bush family and their masters and associates areresponsible rarely come to light because the media, at the top level, is controlled bythe Illuminati and most journalists either don't realise they are pawns in a game or"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•The Bush family crime\t53they accept it to protect their careers. The accounts are legion of how evidence andfootage that expose the lies, especially in wartime, are banned or confiscated. Oneexample during the 1991 Gulf Slaughter was when the American TV networks NBCand CBS refused to air pictures shot in Iraq of the destruction of civilian areas thatrevealed the Bush government and military accounts to be a grotesque fiction - justas they are in the \"war on terrorism\". The story was blocked by the President ofNBC Michael Gartner and the producers offered it to CBS, where Tom Bettag, theExecutive Editor of the CBSEvening News,said one of them would appear on theshow the following day to tell their story That evening Bettag was sacked and thestory buried. This is the real background to the TV news.\" Footage of the Highwayof Death was also suppressed and, as in the \"war on terrorism\", US casualtiescaused by the enemy were claimed to be \"training accidents\". Bush's lies aboutIraqi troop deployments in Kuwait, provable by satellite images, were also nevershown. This satellite \"loophole in the lies\" was the reason why the US governmentpurchased all rights to satellite pictures of Afghanistan while that country wassubjected to another insane American and British bombing onslaught. We shouldnote, of course, that having said that the CIA-installed dictator Saddam Husseinwas a threat to the world, and with the Iraqi \"army\" destroyed, Father George Bushsuddenly called an end to the \"war\" and pulled the troops out leaving Saddam stillintact. As Norman Schwarzkopf said with an air of disappointment: \"We couldhave completely closed the door and made it a battle of annihilation ... [it was]literally about to become the battle of Cannae, a battle of annihilation.\" Ah, nevermind Norman, but you see your President and those who controlled him wantedHussein to stay put, or at least appear to, so they could play that card over and over.I suspect, however, that the Saddam story is going to lead to some kind of climaxeventually.Look at this America ...The public believe the Gulf War ended in 1991, but in fact it was only beginning.Using the \"threat\" of Saddam, the \"threat\" Bush chose not to remove when it wasthere for the taking, the United States and the UK, the diabolical duo of worldterrorism, have led a campaign of \"sanctions\" against Iraq. They have alsocontinued, unreported, the bombing of civilian targets, a policy maintained by theClinton and Boy George Bush administrations. Investigative journalist John Pilgerwrote of a woman he met in northern Iraq who had lost her husband, children andfather-in-law when they were bombed by two US planes while tending their sheepon open land.\" The sanctions against a country that imports 70% of its food havebeen imposed on a people already devastated by the mass bombing of theirelectricity,water supply, transport and sewer systems, which the British andAmerican governments have refused to allow them to rebuild. A public health teamfrom Harvard University went into Iraq soon after the official bombing andestimated that over 46,000 children under the age of five had already died byAugust 1991 because of the destruction of Iraq's infrastructure.\" But the nightmarewas only beginning. Writer Thomas J. Nagy exposed the coldly calculated way the"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"54\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want.

In an article headed \"TheSecret Behind the Sanctions: How the US Intentionally Destroyed Iraq's WaterSupply\", he wrote that \"the United States knew the cost that civilian Iraqis, mostlychildren, would pay, and it went ahead anyway.\" \" Nagy, who lectures at the Schoolof Business and Public Management at George Washington University, uncovereddocuments from the US Defense Intelligence Agency that reveal a stunningdisregard for human life. A document dated January 22nd 1991 says:\"Iraq depends on importing specialized equipment and some chemicals to purify itswater supply ... Failing to secure supplies will result in a shortage of pure drinking waterfor much of the population. This could lead to increased incidences, if not epidemics, ofdisease.\" They add that the \"most likely diseases during [the] next 60-90 days[include]: diarrhoea) diseases (particularly children); acute respiratory illnesses (coldsand influenza); typhoid; hepatitis A (particularly children); measles, diphtheria, andpertussis (particularly children); meningitis, including meningococcal (particularlychildren); cholera (possible, but less likely).\"42This is a fundamental violation of the Geneva Convention which says:\"It is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove, or render useless objects indispensable tothe survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinkingwater installations and supplies, and irrigation works, for the specific purpose ofdenying them for their sustenance value to the civilian population or to the adverseparty, whatever the motive.\"The US/British-led sanctions against Iraq do all of these things.By 1995 Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was forced to admit on the USSixty Minutestelevision programme that these sanctions had already cost the livesofhalf a millionIraqi children and that was only up to then. The figure is currentlyrunning at some 5,000 dead children a month and passingamillionin total, whilethe perpetrators lead a \"war on terrorism\"! Albright said onSixty Minutesthat shethought the consequences for those children were worth it to stop Saddam. This isthe mentality that controls our world. A report by Richard Garfield of ColumbiaUniversity concluded that the increase in child death rates in Iraq was virtuallyunique in modern health studies.\" Conditions like kwashiorkor and marasmus, theresult of starvation, are now common. We are told of the horrific treatment ofwomen by the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, but not of the same treatment bySaudi Arabia, a brutal, fascist regime, which is on the side of the \"goodguys\"in the\"war against sanity\"; and we are told nothing about the plight of women in Iraq inthe face of the US and British-led sanctions. Some 70% of Iraqi women are nowanaemic. Denis Halliday, the coordinator of the so-called \"oil-for-food\" programme,resigned in September 1998 and spoke out against the genocidal affects of the"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•The Bush family crime\t55sanctions. His successor, Hans von Sponeck, did the same in February 2000. The USgovernment response was to try to discredit the two men. The \"oil for food\" farceprovides the oil cartel with cheap Iraqi oil; 40% of Iraqi's oil, exchanged to buyfood, ends up in the United States at knock-down prices because of the sanctionsimposed by the United States and supported by the Illuminati front, the UnitedNations.The sanctions are \"justified\" in part because of the \"weapons of massdestruction\", including biological weapons, claimed to be stockpiled by SaddamHussein. Well, first, the Iraqi arsenal, whatever it may be, was funded by the USand British governments and their allies. Second, the biggest owner of weapons ofmass destruction on the planet is the American government and by far the greatestuser of them is ... the US government. Only one government has dropped nuclearweapons on another country at the time of writing ... the US government. Britishleaders, too, have an appalling record of genocide and as far back as 1919, whenWinston Churchill was Secretary of State at the War Office, they were usingchemical weapons against Iraq. Churchill said this about the use of poison gas toput down an Iraqi rebellion against colonial rule: \"I do not understand thissqueamishness about the use of gas. I am strongly in favour of using [it] againstuncivilised tribes.\" ' When Saddam Hussein offered in 1990 to destroy suchweapons in Iraq if Israel did the same with theirs, the United States governmentsaid it was not willing to negotiate on that subject - not least because toacknowledge that Israel has a massive nuclear capability would make illegal thebillions of dollars of US aid to that country every year.\" They all know of Israel'snuclear stockpile, but if no one officially admits it exists they can go on withbusiness as usual. As the former United Nations Secretary-General, BoutrosBoutros-Ghali said: \"It would be some time before I fully realised that the UnitedStates sees little need for diplomacy. Power is enough. Only the weak rely ondiplomacy ... The Roman Empire had no need for diplomacy. Nor does the UnitedStates.\"46It appears to see no need to tell the truth, either. In early 1999, it wasrevealed that the Iraqis' claims about United Nations weapon inspections in theircountry was correct. The UNSCOM inspections were being used for spying by theUnited States. TheWashington Postof March 2nd quoted US officials who describedhow members of the UNSCOM team had been planting spying devices for theUnited States during their \"independent inspections\". Scott Ritter, one of theweapons inspectors in Iraq, made it clear that the United States and Britishgovernments were lying about the dangers posed by Iraq - the very \"dangers\" theyhave used to justify their onslaught against Iraqi civilians, especially children. Rittersaid in the June 2000 edition ofArms Control Today:\"Given the comprehensive nature of the monitoring regime put in place by UNSCOM,which included a strict export-import control regime, it was possible as early as 1997 todetermine that, from a qualitative standpoint, Iraq had been disarmed. Iraq no longerpossessed any meaningful quantities of chemical or biological agent, if it possessedany at all, and the industrial means to produce these agents had either been eliminated"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"56\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.or were subject to stringent monitoring. The same was true of Iraq's nuclear andballisticmissile capabilities.'...By the end of 1998, Iraq had, in fact, been disarmed to a level unprecedented inmodern history, but UNSCOM and the Security Council were unable - and in someinstances unwilling -to acknowledge this accomplishment.\"Why? Because it would have destroyed the cover story necessary to continue thegenocide. Add to that the voting record of the United States at the United Nationswhere it has consistently opposed resolutions to limit the production and testing ofbiological and nuclear weapons, as it has on a stream of humanitarian and freedomissues. Robert Cooper, a former diplomat and personal assistant for foreign affairsto British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, admitted inThe Post-Modern State and the WorldOrder:\"We need to get used to the idea of double standards ... [in other words] ...get over it, we are hypocrites (but powerful ones).\" Cooper said that the conflictwith Iraq was to maintain control of oil supplies and that \" ... The reasons forfighting the Gulf War were not that Iraq had violated the norms of internationalbehaviour ...\". Exactly. They just use any excuse to sell a lie to the people toadvance their agenda - as they have with September 11th. When Saddam Husseinused chemical weapons on the Kurdish people, the United States and Britain didn'tsay a word because he was a US ally at the time, fighting the Iraq-Iran war in whichthe US and Britain were arming both sides. The forces of freedom and liberty havealso been bombing Iraq with radioactive weapons and this has led to the birth ofbabies with horrible deformities and disease (see my website). Since thisbombardment began, Iraq has developed the world's highest rate of childhoodleukaemia. At the same time there has been an embargo on medicines andtechnology that would help to reduce the radiation. The genocidal attacks on theIraqi population began with \"Republican\" George Bush, continued with\"Democrat\" Bill Clinton, and within a month of taking office at the start of 2001,George W. Bush, another \"Republican\", was ordering (being told to order) more\"routine\" bombing of Iraq. In truth they are just lackeys for the same one-party stateand that's why the policies never change no matter who is in the White House.The bank of crooks and criminals (BCCI)The funding and manipulation of the Gulf War connects with another scandal, thatof the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. This had close links with theItalian BNL, the bank used by the United States to bankroll Saddam Hussein. Abrief summary of the BCCI debacle is necessary because of the people involved andthe connections from the BCCI through to current events. The BCCI was formed inthe early 1970s and expanded rapidly to boast 400 branches in 78 countries. Itsname is remarkably similar to the Banque De Credit International (BCI) of theMossad agent Rabbi Tibor Rosenbaum, which was used by the British-AmericanIntelligence network involved in the assassination of President Kennedy (seeAndThe Truth Shall Set You Free).Its \"successor\", the BCCI, was a major player in the"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•The Bush family crime\t57drug money-laundering network and was used for this purpose by Illuminatielements within the CIA, British Intelligence and Mossad. Money to fund covertoperations, terrorists groups like those of Osama bin Laden and Abu Nidal, coupsand assassinations throughout the world, and the financing of Iran-Contra andSaddam Hussein, was also channelled through the BCCI. Former US Green BeretAlbert Carone claimed he was a representative of the BCCI while working on covertoperations. He said the bank was founded by the US intelligence community tofinance covert operations worldwide without the approval of Congress.\" In otherwords, to finance the Illuminati agenda. Money could be transferred betweenapparent enemies through this network, as with Saudi Arabian money, which founditsway to Mossad. In this case, Saudi and other Gulf money was laundered throughthe BCCI and transferred to CenTrust in Miami, which was later seized by Federalinvestigators. The BCCI owned 28% of CenTrust. Allegations emerged that RobertGates, the man Bush nominated as his Director of the CIA, had obstructed aninvestigation into drug money laundering by the BCCI. Gates withdrew hisnomination to be CIA Director, as he had once before when implicated in Iran-Contra. The BCCI crashed amid a worldwide scandal in 1991. It was the world'sbiggest banking collapse and cost investors billions of dollars. Three years beforethe crash, Robert Gates was describing the BCCI as the Bank of Crooks andCriminals. The BCCI began to operate in Pakistan in 1972 with most of its fundingprovided by the Bank of America and the CIA. Bank of America also loaned moneyto people to buy stock in BCCI, probably to hide the scale of its control, and the B ofA knew all about money laundering. In 1986, it was fined $7 million for 17,000 actsof washing dirty money. Some researchers say that the Rothschilds control the Bankof America. At the hub of the Rothschild involvement in the BCCI was DoctorAlfred Hartmann who, at the same time, was the managing director of the Swissbranch of the BCCI; the head of the Zurich Rothschild bank, AG; a board member ofN.M. Rothschild in London; and a director of ... Italy's BNL, the bank throughwhich the Bush government covertly funded Saddam Hussein. The involvement ofthe Rothschilds at the heart of the BCCI was never mentioned or investigated by themedia, nor was the alleged involvement of the financier and currency speculator,George Soros, of the Illuminati Bilderberg Group.Here a Bush, there a Bush, everywhere a Bush, BushFather George Bush and his successor Bill Clinton both had considerableconnections with the BCCI. Among them was Jackson Stephens. He is the owner ofStephens Incorporated, a big investment bank based in Little Rock, Arkansas, thehome of Bill Clinton. Stephens was one of the founders of the BCCI. He hadconnections with a company called Harken Energy and arranged a loan for themfrom a Swiss bank affiliated with the BCCI. This would have greatly pleased GeorgeW. Bush, the then President's son, who sat on the Harken board and had a fortuneinvested in the company Another investor in Harken Energy, it emerged afterSeptember 11th, was Khalid bin Mahfouz, the operations director of the BCCI and20% shareholder who was later named by the United States government as a"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"58\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.financial supporter of Osama bin Laden. What a coincidence. Jeb Bush, BoyGeorge's brother and now Governor of Florida, also had numerous dealings withthe BCCI. He was often seen in the bank's Miami office and Father George's deputycampaign manager, James Lake, worked for a major owner of the BCCI at the time.When Bill Clinton, Father Bush's \"opponent\", ran for president, his main financialbacker was the same Jackson Stephens who made the donations via his WorthenNational Bank, which was connected to the BCCI. Stephens was implicated in dealsin which the BCCI secretly and illegally took over the First American Bank ofWashington and others. This was the man who funded the Bushes and the Clintons.Father George's involvement with the BCCI was considerable, according to theChicago journalist, Sherman Skolnick, who made a detailed study of the bank. Hehas claimed publicly, including an interview on Radio Free America, that Bush,Saddam Hussein, and others, used the BCCI to split $250 billion in oil \"kick backs\",the skimming-off of money paid by western oil companies in the Gulf. Otherresearchers and insiders have said the same. Skolnick claims that the recordsimplicating Bush in deals with Saddam and former Panama President ManuelNoriega were in the hands of the Bank of England and that the money waschannelled through the BCCI and Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) branches inthe USA. Henry Gonzales, the chairman of the House Banking Committee,identified links between the BCCI and BNL. Skolnick told interviewer TomValentine on Radio Free America:\"[The BCCI] ... was formed in the 1970s with seed money from the Bank of America,the largest shareholders of which are the Rothschilds of Chicago, Paris, London, andSwitzerland ... The bank is also linked to the financial affairs of former President JimmyCarter and his friend, and one-time budget director, banker Bert Lance.\"Some of the ... Democrats who have been involved in this whole affair have beenpublished, for example, in the May 3rd issue of the Wall Street Journal. During the1988 presidential campaign, additionally, BCCI was one of the major financiers of theMichael Dukakis campaign ... BCCI financed the Democratic Party in the United Statesand arranged deals for Republicans outside the United States.\"48Jimmy Carter personally dedicated a number of BCCI branches and they made an$8.5 million donation to one of his favourite charities. Carter's foreign travel after heleft the White House was paid for by the BCCI and his banker friend Bert Lance wasbailed out of big financial difficulties by Gaith Pharaon, a front man for the BCCI.Andrew Young, Carter's former United Nations ambassador, and a fellow memberof the Illuminati's Trilateral Commission, had a loan of $160,000 written off by theBCCI and was paid to promote the bank to individuals and governments in Africaand Central America. Orrin Hatch, the Republican Senator for Utah, was makingstirring speeches in support of the BCCI even while it was being indicted for drugmoney laundering. This is the same Orrin Hatch who told CNN immediately afterthe planes struck the World Trade Center that officials believed that Osama bin"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•The Bush family crime\t59Laden could be responsible.' The Democrat Clark Clifford and his law partnerRobert Altman, the BCCI's lawyers, were at the centre of the story, also.Pricewaterhouse, the BCCI's auditors for nearly 20 years, were giving the bank alargely clean bill of health while all the corruption was going on. Skolnick saidrecords detailing the alleged Bush-Saddam deals were held in the Chicago branch ofthe BCCI, which was seized by the Federal government in 1988. Skolnick went on:\"The same bank has records showing joint business ventures between GeneralManuel Noriega, former dictator of Panama, and George Bush. In January of 1990, theFederal prosecutor in Tampa had former top officials of Florida's branch on trial. Theywere allowed to escape prison with only a slap on the wrist and a small penalty. Here'swhy: they told the Justice Department that if they were going to prison, they haddocuments from their bank showing that George Bush had private business venturesthrough their bank with a series of dictators including not only Saddam and Noriega,but others as well .....Saddam's oil was shipped to Texas. In 1985 a Texas jury, at the behest of Pennzoil,issued the largest damages verdict in American history against Texaco. Pennzoilclaimed that Texaco damaged them in a deal with Getty Oil. Who owns Pennzoil? GeorgeBush and his friends ... as a result Texaco fell under the domination and supervision ofPennzoil. Where did the kickbacks to Saddam reportedly come from? They came fromdeals between Texaco and its subsidiaries purchasing oil from Iraq.\"50You can leave your lid on ...If you placed end to end all the questions that Father George Bush needs to answer,but won't, they would stretch from Washington to Baghdad. An officialinvestigation was ordered to investigate the BCCI scandal and was chaired byDemocrat Senator, John Kerry, of Massachusetts. It exposed nothing. Senator Kerrywas chairman of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee that received largecontributions from the BCCI and he is also a member of the Skull and Bones Society.The corruption across American politics, media, banking, business and the militaryis simply staggering, and so it is in the United Kingdom wing of the Illuminati,where the BCCI had its main base. The British Prime Minister at the time of thecover-up was John Major who is now a business associate of Father George Bush,who was US President at the time. The British \"inquiry\" report on the bank by LordJustice Bingham decided that the collapse was due to \"a tragedy of errors,misunderstandings, and failures of communication\". For goodness sake, it was oneof the biggest drug money, terrorist-funding, and illegal arms money launderingoperations the world has yet seen. It implicated some of the biggest names in globalpolitics, banking and business, and financed terrorists, drug cartels and covertoperations by British Intelligence, the CIA and others of that ilk. The Bank ofEngland completed the cover-up through an arrangement with Abu Dhabi, thebank's principal owners at the time of the collapse. This agreement allowed"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"60\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want.

In his review ofDirty Money,a book about the BCCI, the journalist Robert Sherrill said:\"Dirty Money clearly leaves the impression that many officials are less thanenthusiastic about digging deeper into the scandal. Could it be because of thatrumoured list of 100 politicians that the BCCI paid off? Or because 'key investigators'have indicated that if they continued their probe it might take them 'into the highestlevels of political power around the world' in ways that would dwarf even the wildestconspiracy theory. Whoa! That would never do.\"51The invasion of PanamaReaders new to this information will no doubt be extremely surprised to see thenames of Saddam Hussein and General Manuel Noriega so closely connected toFather George Bush. After all, didn't he invade both of their countries on the pretextof removing their \"terrorist\" regimes? Ah, but that's the movie version for publicconsumption. The real story, as always, is very different - just as it is withSeptember 11th. The Bush attack on Panama on December 20th 1989 was aboutdrugs, although not in the way it was portrayed by the government and the media.This is another fine example of how the truth of the situation is submerged inpolitical rhetoric and media camouflage. We are told that American troops invadedPanama and abducted President Manuel Noriega because of his drug-runningactivities and to save American children from the evil of drugs. In fact, the oppositewas the case. Noriega was on the payroll of the CIA while Bush was its Director andhe was being paid some $110,000 a year for his \"services\", which included runningdrugs. When Bush was challenged about this after the invasion of Panama, he saidhe had never met Noriega, but then suddenly remembered the meeting. Noriegawas involved in drug trafficking and rigged elections, but the Bush government andthe CIA knew that when they employed him. William Tyree, a former member ofthe elite US Green Beret regiment, said in testimony for a law-suit against GeorgeBush and the CIA filed in 1998 that he flew more than 100 plane loads of cocainefrom Colombia to the Albrook Air Station in Panama between December 1975 andMarch 1976 as part of \"Operation Watchtower\". Looking on as the cocaine wasunloaded, he said, were CIA officers, an Israeli colonel and Manuel Noriega. Tyreefiled the suit in an effort to prove his innocence after being jailed for the murder ofhis wife, Elaine. She kept a diary of her husband's drug-running activities for theCIA and George Bush, and when Tyree began to speak out about his experiences hiswife was murdered, the diary stolen, and he was framed for the killing in 1979.Tyree alleged in the suit that Father George Bush ordered the theft and destructionof his wife's diary. Another Green Beret, Colonel Albert Carone, described how heworked with Oliver North in drug trafficking during Iran-Contra. Carone wasmurdered in 1990 and five other Special Forces colonels also involved have died inmysterious circumstances. Carone's testimony was among the documents presentedby Tyree in the lawsuit, which, of course, was covered up.52"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•The Bush family crime\t61Arnulfo Arias won the 1984 Panama election, but Noriega took power with amixture of extreme violence and fraud. The US Secretary of State George Shultz, amajor Illuminati operator, was dispatched to give legitimacy to Noriega and even todeclare that Panama's democratic principles were a lesson to the Sandinistagovernment in Nicaragua! According to Noriega, his relationship with Bush beganto change during the Iran-Contra period when Admiral John Poindexter, the headof the National Security Council, visited him on December 17th 1985. Poindexterwas prosecuted for his part in Iran-Contra. Noriega told CBS reporter Mike Wallacethat Poindexter demanded that he support the illegal US war against the Sandinistagovernment in Nicaragua. When he refused, Poindexter threatened economicwarfare and the destabilisation of Panama. What Poindexter wanted was forPanama to invade Nicaragua with American support, Noriega said.\" At no pointwas Noriega's alleged involvement in drugs mentioned. But the US DrugEnforcement Administration (DEA) did contact him about drugs. They wrote tocongratulate him on helping them to stop Panama being used as a drug and drugmoney-laundering centre! Just one month later, the Reagan-Bush administrationdemanded that Noriega be removed on the grounds of drugs, corruption, and lackof democracy. This from a government that, through agencies like the CIA, hassupported and imposed some of the most grotesque dictatorships across the worldto suit its own agenda, including the financing of terrorists to murder woman andchildren by the thousand. The same government that said Panamanian democracywas a lesson to Nicaragua. It is not easy to establish the motivation of DrugEnforcement Administration agents because among them are both peoplecommitted to stopping the flow of drugs into America and others equallydetermined to increase it. A number of DEA and CIA operatives have describedhow some officials of the Drug Enforcement Administration are involved inexpanding the availability of hard drugs on the streets of the United States.Noriega's former chief adviser, Jose Blandon, has claimed that the DEA hasprotected the biggest players in the drug empires and that DEA officials paidNoriega $4.7 million to keep quiet. Dennis Dale, who headed a DEA operation inCentral America, said in testimony that \"... the major targets of my investigationsalmost invariably turned out to be working for the CIA\".' In February 1988,Noriega was indicted on drugs charges and all but one were related to activitiesbefore 1984 when he was on the CIA payroll. Economic sanctions against Panamafollowed - the economic warfare that Poindexter had promised. If Noriega hadagreed to support the US with Nicaragua, or hadn't fallen out with Bush, he wouldstill be dictator of Panama instead of sitting in a US jail.When Bush officially became President in 1989, he made the ludicrous statementthat Panama posed an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" to US National Securityand foreignpolicy.USNews and World Reportsaid on May 1st 1989 that Bush hadauthorised $10 million in CIA expenditure on projects against the Panamagovernment. Some of the money was delivered by the CIA's Carlos Eleta Almaran,who had recently been arrested for drug trafficking. Bush ordered those charges tobe dropped after Noriega was ousted.

It's justa choice right now between fear and love.there despite the CIA's best efforts, United States forces invaded Panama.Thousands of civilians, including children, were killed. This was covered up by theBush administration, but I have seen video footage of the devastation in civilianareas caused by the US attacks - areas that housed some of the poorest people in thecountry. The lives of the poor had already been devastated by US economic warfare.Noriega was abducted to America for trial and jailed on drugs charges. The rest ofthe \"free world\", including Britain's Margaret Thatcher, offered not a word ofprotest. The judge at his trial refused to allow any CIA documents to be seen in hisdefence and he was sentenced to 40 years' imprisonment. What, therefore, shouldBush and other government and CIA officials receive if they ever came to trial?They would have to reincarnate many times to complete the sentence. One of thekey prosecution witnesses in the \"trial\" of Noriega was Carlos Lehder. He is a co-founder of the Medellin drug cartel in Colombia and a business partner of the Bushfamily, who are fundamentally involved in the Medellin operation.\" Lehder, realname Carlos Enrique Lehder Rivas, was extradited to the US on drugs charges andgave evidence against Noriega while saying nothing about the Bush connection. Hewas given a much-reduced sentence for his own drug convictions and thenapparently \"disappeared\" from the US prison system.\" The \"leaders\" the Bushregime imposed on the people of Panama to replace Noriega were fundamentallyconnected with the money-laundering and drug-trafficking business. The newPresident, Guillermo Endara, was on official of at least six banks involved in drugmoney-laundering. The money laundered through these sources came from theColombian drug-smuggling ring led by Augusto Falcon and Salvador Magluta,who were reported to be smuggling one ton of cocaine a month into Florida fromthe late 1970s until 1987.57The new Vice President in Panama installed by Bush wasRicardo Arias Calderon whose brother was president of the First InteramericasBank when it was controlled by the Cali drug cartel. Official figures show that drugtrafficking and money laundering in Panama after Noriega was ousted was greaterthan it had been when he was there. The invasion and US (Illuminati) puppetregimes that have followed also ensured that the United States would retain controlof the Panama Canal zone that was officially handed back to Panama in 1999.The truth of what really happened in Panama was suppressed - as it was inAfghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo, Bosnia ad infinitum - by the government and militarycontrol of the media. What happened in Panama happens everywhere thesedisturbed people take their murder machine. The media were not allowed to goanywhere that did not suit the official story and they were presented with \"news\"conferences in which US officials told the reporters whatever they wanted thepeople to believe. Other non-American journalists were arrested and a Spanishnews photographer, Juantxu Rodriguez, was shot dead by US soldiers while he wastaking incriminating pictures of what was really happening. There is, in fact, noindependent footage of the three days of the invasion, only what the Bushgovernment said had happened, and the Bush forces took over Panamaniantelevision stations to broadcast their own propaganda. Can you imagine what theUnited States and Britain would say if any other country did this? These two are the"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•The Bush family crime\t63bullies of the world. It was the same with those who campaigned for democracy oropposed the US invasion. Thousands of such people on the \"dissident\" lists (humanrights campaigners, independent newspaper editors, union leaders and so on) werejailed without trial or even charge. Some stayed there for years. This systematiccover-up hid the fact that thousands of civilians were killed by the Bush invasion,not the 250 he claimed, and that tens of thousands were made homeless. Massgraves have since been uncovered of those who died unreported at the hands ofBush. (See the superb video,The Panama Deception,58which has pictures that Bushand his henchmen worked so hard to suppress).Bush the child abuserGeorge Bush and his associate Henry Kissinger are mass murderers on a scale thatbeggars belief and so are those who support them and make it possible. The list ofIlluminati slaughter and financial manipulation goes on and on with themanufactured wars and the CIA/British Intelligence-imposed dictators and killersplaced in power across the world in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Korea, Nicaragua,Panama, Grenada, Indonesia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan to name only afew. The dead, maimed, starving, destitute and dispossessed that have ensued canbe numbered in billions of our fellow men, women and children. Now they havelaunched a \"war on terrorism\" that allows them to target any country they choose.But then why should people who sexually and violently abuse and murder littlechildren have any emotional attachment to the suffering they daily orchestrate? Farfetched? No, no. If you readThe Biggest Secret, Children Of The Matrix,and otherbooks by researchers and victims of these people, you'll see this is no fantasy.George Bush, for example, is a notorious paedophile, torturer and killer of childrenamong those who have researched this. In a book calledTrance formation OfAmerica,\"Cathy O'Brien, a mind-controlled slave of people like Bush and DickCheney for the first 30 years of her life, tells of her own and her daughter's abuse byBush. Daughter Kelly was only a small child when Bush began his sexual andviolent abuse of her, born as she was into the captivity in which her mother hadlong been imprisoned. This is just one of her experiences with President GeorgeBush, father and controller of George W. Bush in the \"war on terrorism. AlexHouston was her CIA handler in the US government mind-control programmeknown as MK Ultra:\"Kelly became violently, physically ill after her induction into George Bush's'neighborhood' and from every sexual encounter she had with him thereafter, she ran104-6 degree temperatures, vomited and endured immobilizing headaches for anaverage of three days. These were the only telltale evidences aside from the scarringburns left on her skin. Houston forbade me to call a doctor, and Kelly forbade me tocomfort her, pitifully complaining that her head 'hurt too bad even to move'. And she didnot move for hours on end. Kelly often complained of severe kidney pain and her rectumusually bled for a day or two after Bush sexually abused her. My own mind-controlvictimization rendered me unable to help or protect her ..."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"64\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want.

I have overheard of him speak blatantly of his sexual abuse ofher on many occasions. He used this and threats to her life to 'pull my strings' andcontrol me. The psychological ramifications of being raped by a paedophile presidentare mind shattering enough, but reportedly Bush further reinforced his traumas toKelly's mind with sophisticated NASA electronic and drug mind controlled devices. Bushalso instilled the 'Who ya gonna call?' and 'I'll be watching you' binds on Kelly, furtherreinforcing her sense of helplessness. The systematic tortures and traumas I enduredas a child now seem trite in comparison to the brutal, physical and psychologicaldevastation that Bush inflicted on my daughter.\"\"This man was in the White House for 12 years and now his son is president.Such a mentality would not plan and execute what happened on September 11th, anevent that has so massively advanced the Illuminati agenda for a global fasciststate?

From the moment of birth, probably even before if you readof the Illuminati \"in the womb\" techniques described inThe Biggest Secret,he was,like his father, groomed and moulded to serve the Illuminati cause, and a look at hisbackground presents September 11th and current events in a very differentperspective. He attended Yale University and was initiated into the Skull and BonesSociety and later Bohemian Grove before studying, at least in theory, at the HarvardBusiness School. Bush avoided the draft to Vietnam, a war created and perpetuatedby the Illuminati who controlled his father.Washington Poststaff writers GeorgeLardner Jr and Lois Romano revealed in an article in 1999 how two weeks before hewas due to graduate from Yale, Bush arrived at the offices of the Texas Air NationalGuard at Ellington Field outside Houston and said he wanted to sign up for pilottraining.' This was on May 27th 1968 when the Vietnam War was at its peak withsome 350 Americans dying every week and goodness knows how manyVietnamese. In 12 days' time he would have lost his student immunity from thedraft and so he grasped, with his father's help, an escape route from combat byjoining the National Guard. Father George was at this time a Congressman forHouston, and a supporter of the Vietnam conflict and the policy of sendingAmerican soldiers there to suffer and die.Many of the American elite were trying to pull the same trick for their sons andthe National Guard had a long waiting list. Not only that, Boy George had scoredonly 25% in a pilot aptitude test and that was the lowest acceptable grade. That willsurprise no one with a brain who sees him today, and all these factors should haveprevented his admission and, therefore, his avoidance of the draft to Vietnam. Yet,wait for this ... Boy George was sworn in as an airman with the Texas Air NationalGuard on thesame daythat he applied. Colonel Walter B. \"Buck\" Staudt, thecommander of the 147th Fighter Group, even staged a special ceremony later so he67"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"68\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.could be photographed administering the oath for Bush instead of the captain whohad sworn in Bush earlier. Staudt did the same when Bush was commissioned as asecond lieutenant. Lloyd Bentsen Jr, a major Texas Democrat, ensured that his son,Lloyd Bentsen III, was enlisted into the National Guard by Staudt around the sametime as Bush. Both were nominated for promotion to first lieutenant on the ElectionDay in 1970 when Father Bentsen beat Father Bush for a seat in the Senate. OtherVietnam avoiders in the Texas National Guard included the son of RepublicanSenator John Tower and at least seven members of the Dallas Cowboys Americanfootball team. TheWashington Postarticle revealed:\"One address for those seeking help getting in was Ben Barnes, a Democrat who wasthen the speaker of the Texas House and a protege of Governor John B. Connally. A topaide to Barnes, Nick Kralj, simultaneously served as aide to the head of the Texas AirNational Guard, the late Brigadier General James M. Rose.\"An anonymous letter addressed to a US attorney in Texas, produced in a discoveryproceeding for an ongoing lawsuit, charged that Barnes assisted Bush in getting into theGuard. The suit was brought by the former director of the Texas Lottery Commission, whobelieves that Barnes, now a lobbyist, may have played a role in his dismissal.\"In a deposition for the suit, Kralj confirmed that he would get calls from Barnes or hischief of staff, Robert Spelling, `saying so-and-so is interested in getting in the Guard.'Kralj said he would then forward the names to Gen. Rose.\"2When the obvious questions were asked about this at the time of Bush's run forthe presidency, Staudt said that no favouritism had been shown to him. You are aliar Colonel Staudt, as any idiot can see. Talking of which, Bush claimed he did notjoin the National Guard to avoid the Vietnam War that he and his father supported,but rather because he wanted to be a fighter pilot. OK, insult my intelligence somemore. Even on his National Guard application forms he ticked the box saying, \"donot volunteer\" when asked if he wanted to go overseas. Not only did he avoidgoing to Vietnam, he was even able to live in his then home town of Houston whilelearning to be a pilot who was never to face a conflict. He served as an F-102 pilotwith the Texas Air National Guard to avoid the draft to Vietnam and became ahard-drinking, cocaine-snorting, womaniser before \"discovering Jesus\" (I know, Iknow, of course that last bit is ludicrous, but this is the official story). On November5th 1977 the annual anniversary of the Guy Fawkes (Percy-Bush family) plot toblow up the British Parliament, Bush married former teacher and librarian, LauraWelch, who is used to smokescreen his real lifestyle, and they have two teenagedaughters, Barbara and Jenna.Snort, snortBush's drug habit was brought to public attention - and then buried by the media- with the publication of the book,Fortunate Son: George Bush and the Making of a"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Born to be king\t69President,in 1999. The author J.H. Hatfield was subjected to a national campaignof character assassination after he claimed that Bush was arrested on drug chargesin 1972 while serving with the National Guard, but that this had been wiped fromthe record by a Republican judge and friend of his father in exchange for Bush'sparticipation in a community service programme called Project PULL inHouston's inner city. The author cites three anonymous sources to support hisclaim.What is for sure is that suddenly, and for no credible reason, this hard-drinking playboy felt an overwhelming desire to volunteer to work with blackinner-city kids in Project PULL. After Hatfield's character was attacked by themedia and pressure from the Bush camp, the publisher, St Martin's Press,withdrew the book. But in early 2000 it was republished by Soft Skull Press, asmall title on New York's Lower East Side, and the publisher, Sander Hicks,released a document from the Texas Air National Guard, which reveals that Bushwas suspended from flying for failure to take a medical exam in the same periodthat Hatfield says he was busted for cocaine possession. Bush's 175-page NationalGuard service records were obtained by Hicks from the Department of Defensethrough the Freedom of Information Act. They note the verbal orders of the\"Comdr on 1 Aug 72\" suspending Bush, a 27-year-old first lieutenant, for \"failureto accomplish annual medical examination\" while stationed at Ellington Air ForceBase in Houston. Hicks, who says he knows the identity of the three unconnectedHatfield sources, writes:\"Where was George W. Bush in 1972? Our author, J.H. Hatfield, cites three sourcesclose to the Texas governor in the Afterword to Fortunate Son who state Bush had acocaine arrest 'fixed' by his father in Houston in 1972. No one has adequatelyexplained why he had a sudden charitable desire to perform community service atProject PULL, an inner-city youth center. Ironically, government documents note duringthe same period Bush's flying suspension for failure to take an annual medicalexamination, even though the Republican presidential candidate has repeatedlystated he was a healthy young man at the time. Combined with the new introductionto the book that cites an on-the-record admission by Michael Dannenhauer, formerchief of staff to the elder Bush, that George W. was 'out of control' in his abuseof cocaine and alcohol and experienced 'lost weekends in Mexico' in the '70s,the Defense Department document adds further credibility to Hatfield and\"Fortunate Son.\"'3We should also note that this medical Bush failed to take included a drug test.The LondonSunday Timesreported in April 1972 that the Pentagon had ordereddrug tests at least once a year for officers on \"extended active duty\", includingreservists like Bush. Publisher Sander Hicks quotes Michael Dannenhauer assaying: \"There was cocaine use, lots of women, but the drinking was the worst.\"Bush lies yet again when he says that his 1972 flying suspension was because hisdoctor was in Houston while he was in Alabama working on a political campaign.Air Force Lieutenant Colonel (Retired) Lou Kaposta told Soft Skull Press:"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"70\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.\"According to my background of many years as a pilot in the Air Force, you have totake the annual physical as scheduled. You do not have a choice about when, whereor how. You're in the military; the individual's desires don't count. Everybody knowsthat.\"4Former Staff Sergeant Mark Wilson, a veteran of the Texas Air National Guard,said there was \"something fishy\" about Bush's explanation. He told Soft Skull Pressthat Bush was stationed very near to Maxwell Air Force Base at the time and couldeasily have travelled there. Wilson also pointed out that Bush's initial physicalexam, while still at Yale in 1968, was done at Westover Air Force Base inMassachusetts.' So why did Bush only want to be examined by \"his doctor\" at thevery time that Hatfield claims he was arrested for drug offences? James HowardHatfield, the 43-year-old author of Fortunate Son, was found dead in his hotel roomin Springdale, Arkansas, on July 18th 2001. Police said he had committed \"suicide\"from an overdose of prescription drugs. Hatfield left a wife and a daughter. PopeJohn Paul II was reported to have commented on Hatfield's death to reportersoutside the Basilica of St Peter after saying mass:\"Imet Jim Hatfield in Chicago when Fortunate Son was getting reprinted. He shook myhand and gave me a signed copy. I gave him my blessing and told him to go forth andspeak the truth. He said, 'I am already doing that, Father'. We had a laugh together.They tell me he's dead now ... very tragic. He will be remembered in a series of specialmasses. I am sure that he is in heaven with our Lord, Jesus Christ, who said [inMatthew 5:1-2]: 'Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you, and say all kindsof evil against you for my sake. Rejoice and be glad for great is your reward in heaven,for they persecuted the prophets who were before you.\"'6Michael C. Ruppert, a former Los Angeles Police Department narcoticsinvestigator, goes further in his monthly newsletter,From The Wilderness.'He saysthat George W. Bush and his brother, Jeb, now Governor for Florida, were filmedin a 1985 \"sting\" by the US Drug Enforcement Agency at Tamiami airport outsideMiami. Ruppert quotes statements made by Terry Reed, who took part in drugoperations for the CIA and the Bush family involving the notorious and self-confessed drug smuggler Barry Seal, who was murdered when he began to talktoo much. (SeeAnd The Truth Shall Set You Freeand Reed's book,Compromised:Clinton, Bush and the CIA.)'Ruppert says they arrived on the Bush plane King Airfrom the Intermountain regional airport at Mena, Arkansas, to pick up two kilosof cocaine from Seal. Mena was the location of the infamous and well-documented Mena airstrip drug operations involving the then ArkansasGovernor, Bill Clinton (seeAnd The Truth Shall Set You Free).There are someinteresting connections between this area, the Rockefeller family, Wal-Mart storesand China highlighted on the website of researcher and investigative journalistSherman Skolnick.'

Terry Reed quotes in his book aconversation with Barry Seal about the Bush family drug operations. He saysthat Seal told him:\"Ever hear the old expression, it's not what ya know, it's who ya know? Well, whoeversaid that just hadn't caught the Vice President's kids in the dope business, 'cause I cantell ya for sure what ya know can definitely be more useful than who you know ...\"Reed asked Seal if he was saying that Father George Bush's kids were in thedrug business:\"Yup, that's what I'm tellin' ya. A guy in Florida who flipped for the DEA [DrugEnforcement Administration] has got the goods on the Bush boys. Now I heard thisearlier from a reliable source in Colombia, but I just sat on it then, waitin' to use it asa trump card, if I ever needed it. Well, I need to use it now. I got names, dates,places ... even got some tape recordin's. Fuck, I even got surveillance videos catchin'the Bush boys red handed. I consider this stuff my insurance policy ... Now this isreal sensitive shit inside of US Customs and DEA and those guys are pretty muchunder control.\"10Barry Seal's \"insurance\" did not prove too effective, however, because he wassilenced before he could tell his story to a bigger audience. In February 1986, soonafter he began to speak out, he was murdered at Baton Rouge, Louisiana. It wasblamed officially on two Colombian hitmen with Mac-10 machine guns, but whilethey may or may not have been the actual killers, the assassination was ordered bythe highest levels of the United States government to stop his revelations about theBush and Clinton involvement in the drug racket through Mena, Arkansas. Clintonsaid at a press conference at the time that he knew very little about Seal, but anumber of people reported seeing them dining together at Fu Lin's, one of Clinton'sfavourite restaurants in Little Rock.\" Noelle Bush, the 24-year-old daughter of JebBush, was arrested in January 2001 for prescription drug fraud involving an anti-anxiety drug similar to Valium.12Iunderstand her need for that after being broughtup by the Bush family and living with Jeb at the governor's mansion in Florida.With stunning hypocrisy, Jeb Bush said at the time: \"Unfortunately, substance abuseis an issue confronting many families across our nation ...\"13Yes, but not everyfamily has made billions from making those substances available on the streets ofAmerica. Stewart Webb is a private investigator who has uncovered the Bush familyconnections to the drugs trade and the major American financial firms who launderthe money for them. He said:\"George Jr., Jeb and Neil Bush were all party to the crimes involving drugs and gunmoney laundering through Silverado Savings in Denver.

Webb also highlights the Bush family involvement infinancial fraud and murder, but his calls for a Grand Jury investigation into hisfindings have been ignored.The Bush - Bin Laden connectionYou will have noted earlier how Father George went to war against former businessand CIA associates like Saddam Hussein and Manuel Noriega. Such people arefriends while they are useful and foes when they are either a liability or more usefulas enemies in the battle for control of human perception. These are fodder in a gamethat is far bigger than such people understand. You might expect, given this pattern,that the Bush and bin Laden families would have a history of connections andcooperation. And yes, so they have. The official story is that the bin Laden familyhas broken ties with Osama, their terrorist relative, but the only evidence we havefor this are statements made by the bin Laden family and US Intelligence andgovernment sources. What the hell kind of proof is that when they all have a stakein the public believing this version of events? Many others doubt these claims, and Iagree. To say all ties have been severed is nonsense. TheSan Antonio Express-Newsquoted Yossef Bodansky, the director of the House Task Force on Terrorism andUnconventional Warfare, as saying that \"Osama maintains connections\" with someof his nearly two dozen brothers, but he would not elaborate.\" The FBI must havehad their doubts because it subpoenaed banks used by the bin Laden family insearch of records detailing their financial activities, according to a source quoted bytheWall Street journal.\"The BBC'sNewsnightcurrent affairs programme revealed that far from acceptingthat the bin Laden family is innocent of any criminal activity, members of their clanwere being investigated by the FBI before September 11th. Reporter Greg Palastpresented an FBI document with the code 1991-WF-213589, which revealed howagents of the Washington field office were investigating Abdullah bin Laden, thepresident, treasurer and US Director of the World Assembly of Muslim Youth(WAMY) on the grounds of national security.\" WAMY has been suspected offunding terrorism, including the al-Qaeda* network of Osama bin Laden. Hisbrothers, Abdullah bin Laden and Omar bin Laden, another FBI suspect, lived inthe Washington suburb of Falls Church, Virginia, at 3411 Silver Maple Place. This isclose to the headquarters of WAMY in the basement at 5613 Leesburg Pike, and twoblocks away is the house at 5913 Leesburg where four of the alleged hijackersnamed by the FBI after September 11th are said to have stayed.\" This area is close tothe CIA headquarters at Langley. WAMY says it's a charity, but about the same timeas the 9/11 attacks in the US, the Pakistani authorities expelled WAMYrepresentatives. Officials in India also claimed that WAMY was funding anorganisation connected to bombings in Kashmir. The Philippines military said thatWAMY was funding Islamic insurgency.19* There are several different spellings of al-Qaeda and I have chosen this version. Other spellings willappear in some direct quotes."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Born to be king\t73George W. Bush, who claims to be so determined to stop the funding of Osamabin Laden, has not frozen WAMY's assets, and Joe Trento, a \"national securityexpert\", toldNewsnightthat the FBI wanted to continue its inquiries into WAMYand Abdullah bin Laden, but was not allowed to do so. Trento said he had obtaineda secret file which revealed that FBI investigations considered that WAMY fitted thepattern of organisations funding terrorism that had been bankrolled by the Saudiroyal family (who are \"advised\" by Father George Bush) and some of the 20,000Saudi princes. Back in the early 1990s WAMY was being named as a channel forpublic and private Saudi donations to hardline Islamic organisations. One recipientof WAMY support has been the Students Islamic Movement of India that supportedPakistani-backed terrorists in Kashmir and wants an Islamic state in India.20Reporter Greg Palast said thatNewsnighthad uncovered a long history of shadowyconnections between the US State Department, the CIA and the Saudis. MichaelSpringman, the former head of the American visa bureau in Jeddah from 1987 to1989, toldNewsnight:\"In Saudi Arabia I was repeatedly ordered by high-level State Department officials toissue visas to unqualified applicants. These were, essentially, people who had no tieseither to Saudi Arabia or to their own country. I complained bitterly at the time there. Ireturned to the US, I complained to the State Department here, to the GeneralAccounting Office, to the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and to the Inspector General'soffice. I was met with silence.\"What I was protesting was in reality an effort to bring recruits, rounded up by Osamabin Laden, to the United States for terrorist training by the CIA, who then returned toAfghanistan to fight against the then Soviet Union.\"21This was during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and their war with theCIA-backed Mujaheddin, including Osama bin Laden. In the period Springman istalking about here, between 1987 and 1989, Father George Bush, the former head ofthe CIA, officially took control of the White House after being president, in fact ifnot name, under Ronald Reagan.Newsnightalso quoted \"a highly placed source in aUS intelligence agency\" as saying there had always been \"constraints\" oninvestigating Saudis and that, under President Boy George Bush, it had becomemuch worse. FBI agents felt that their investigations into the Saudi connection werebeing obstructed from the highest level in Washington,Newsnightreported, despiteterrorism against Americans being blamed on Osama bin Laden and his Saudi-based backers. These included the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993,which killed six people and injured a thousand, and the Khobar Towers at a USmilitary complex in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, three years later in which 19 Americansdied and some 500 were injured. This was blamed on Osama bin Laden and yet hisfamily business, Bin Laden Construction, was given the contract by the US toreplace it!22"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"74\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want.It's just achoice right now between fear and love.Bush blocks bin Laden investigationNewsnightreported that after George W. became president, FBI agents were told to\"back off\" investigations into the bin Laden-Saudi connection. Greg Palast said thatjust a few days after September 11th, and while Muslim \"suspects\" were beingrounded up all over America, a special charter flight flew 11 members of the binLaden family out of the United States to Saudi Arabia from the same Boston Airportfrom which the attacks on the World Trade Center had been launched. As Imentioned, Yossef Bodansky, director of the House Task Force on Terrorism andUnconventional Warfare, said that bin Laden maintains connections with some of hisnearly two dozen brothers, although he would not elaborate.\" Osama bin Laden hasbeen ostracised and disinherited by his family? Like hell he has and the Bushes, thebin Ladens and the Saudi royal family are all extremely close. This is confirmed byJean-Charles Brisard and Guillaume Dasquie in their French book,Bin Laden: TheForbidden Truth.Brisard is a private intelligence analyst who compiled a report forFrench intelligence in 1997 about the financing of \"bin Laden's\" al-Qaeda terroristnetwork and Dasquie is editor ofIntelligence Online.Brisard says they prove in theirbook that at least until 1998 bin Laden was able to use economic and financialstructures in Saudi Arabia and had contacts with various Saudi officials. After all, theSaudis were supporting the Taliban, who were protecting him in Afghanistan. \"InSaudi Arabia, the left hand ignores the right hand,\" Brisard says, \"and the FBI wasfully aware of the situation.\"24Brisard reveals in his book that John O'Neill, the FBI'sformer deputy director and head of anti-terrorism, resigned in July 2001 because theBoy Bush State Department was blocking the investigation into the bombing in theYemen of theUSSCole,an attack blamed on bin Laden. Brisard says that O'Neill toldhim: \"The main obstacles to investigating Islamic terrorism were US oil interests andthe role played by Saudi Arabia in it.\" When Brisard asked him why the US wasunwilling to go after the states that host bin Laden, he said \"because of oil\". Brisardrevealed in an Internet interview: \"I quote [O'Neill] saying that everything about binLaden and al-Qaida can be explainable through Saudi Arabia.\"25In the greatest of \"coincidences\", John O'Neill left the FBI to become head ofsecurity at the World Trade Center and died in the attacks on September 11th. It wasapparently his first day in the job. Lawyer Michael Wildes gave some 14,000documents to the FBI implicating Saudis in the funding of terrorism. They camefrom a defecting Saudi diplomat represented by Wildes, but the lawyer says thatFBI agents told him they were \"not permitted\" to read them and would not takethem .26He said of the FBI:\"They're cut off at the hip sometimes by supervisors or given shots that are beingcalled from Washington at the highest levels ... You see a difference between therank-and-file counter-intelligence agents, who are regarded by some as the motor poolof the FBI, who drive following diplomats, and the people who are getting the shotscalled at the highest level of our government, who have a different agenda -it's unconscionable.\"21"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Born to be king\t75In the wake of September 11th, FBI Special Agents were furious with the waytheir investigations into potential terrorists and their funding were blocked. Onefiled an official complaint with legal representation from David Schippers, the manwho led the attempted impeachment of Bill Clinton, and Judicial Watch, the privateWashington organisation that investigates and prosecutes official corruption. FBISpecial Agent Robert Wright, Jr, who spent four years tracking terrorist moneylaundering in the United States, believes that if investigations had been allowed tocontinue, the attacks on the World Trade Center could have been stopped.\" Wrighttold the media in May 2002 that the FBI operation, code-named \"Vulgar Betrayal\",confiscated funds that were directly linked to Saudi Arabian businessman YassinKadi, also known as Yassin al-Qadi, who has since been identified as one of the\"chief money launderers\" for Osama bin Laden. Wright said that FBI management\"intentionally and repeatedly thwarted and obstructed\" his efforts to expand theinvestigation to arrest other terrorists and seize their assets. In August 1999 he wasremoved from the operation, which was then shut down. \"As a direct result of theincompetence and, at times, intentional obstruction of justice by FBI management toprevent me from bringing the terrorists to justice,\" he said, \"Americans haveunknowingly been exposed to potential terrorist attacks for years.\"29Long beforeSeptember 11th lawyer David Schippers tried himself to warn Attorney GeneralJohn Ashcroft about the concerns of FBI agents that a terrorist attack on lowerManhattan was planned, but he never received a reply. Schippers was contacted bya number of genuine FBI agents about their concerns. He described theinvestigations into the funding of terrorism:\"This agent here in Chicago filed the affidavit where he laid out the whole way that themoney moves, the way that its handled, how it comes out of the Middle East into theChicago area, not only Chicago, but into the United States, how it's covered, how theoperatives are covered, and then how the money gets back, how it's transferred back,and where it's kept while it's here. And that affidavit ran like 30 pages - laid it out ...He had to go through hell on earth in Washington. He had to fight like a tiger. Everybodyin his own bureau and in the Department of Justice was against him and still is.3oBush and bin Laden: business partnersSo why would the US government want to block investigations into Osama binLaden and other terrorist networks? Here's why. Boy George was a disastrousbusinessman when he followed his father, or \"Poppy\", into the oil and gas industry,but he was always bankrolled or manipulated out of trouble by his father and hisfriends. He launched his own drilling company in June 1977 in the Texas oil town ofMidland. It was called Arbusto Energy and the \"bust\" in the name was veryappropriate. \"Arbusto\", however, means \"shrub\" in Spanish (again spot on),although it seems his family believed it translated as bush. Now ... one of theinvestors in Baby Bush's Arbusto venture was one Salem bin Laden, a close friendof King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, and brother of the \"world's most wanted man,\""},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"76\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.Osama bin Laden. The Saudi Bin Laden Group, formerly Bin Laden BrothersConstruction, is one of the biggest construction companies in the Middle East withsome 40,000 employees, and it has long associations with the US government andprominent American families. This was the company that helped to build Americanairfields in Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War and, as we shall see, built the caveand tunnel complexes with CIA funding that the United States bombed during theattacks on Afghanistan after September 11th. Charles Freeman, president of theMiddle East Policy Council (funded by the bin Laden family) and former USambassador to Saudi Arabia, says: \"If there were ever any company closelyconnected to the US and its presence in Saudi Arabia, it's the Saudi Bin LadenGroup.\"31Wayne Fagan, a San Antonio attorney who represented Salem bin Ladenfrom 1982 to 1988, told theSan Antonio Express-Newsthat his client was \"a goodfriend of the US government\".32Salem bin Laden, investor to George W. Bush,became head of the bin Laden companies with the death in a plane crash of thefamily patriarch, Sheikh Mohammed bin Laden, in 1968. The Sheik left hisindustrial and financial empire to some 54 sons and daughters from a list of wives.Salem bin Laden, the oldest son, took over the estate in 1972.Salem bin Laden became a business partner of George W. Bush through amiddleman called James R. Bath, a close friend of the Bush family and best buddyof Boy George. They \"served\" in the same Texas Air National Guard unit. Indeed,the document obtained by Soft Skull Press, which reveals how Bush was suspendedfrom flying in the same period that J. H. Hatfield said he was busted for cocaine,shows that his friend, Major James R. Bath, also failed to take his annual medicalexamination and was suspended from flying! It was shortly after Father Georgebecame director of the CIA in 1976 that Salem bin Laden appointed Bath, the veryclose friend of \"Dubya\", to represent his \"business interests\" out of the Bush familystronghold of Houston, Texas. Bill White, a former real estate partner of Bath, saidthat Bath told him he was an asset of the CIA and that \"he had been recruited by[Father] George Bush himself in 1976 when Bush was director of the agency ... hesaid Bush wanted him involved with the Arabs, and to get into the aviationbusiness\". During this early period as an asset of Bush's CIA, Bath was at BoyGeorge's side when he ran unsuccessfully to be governor of Texas in 1978 and Bath(the bin Laden family?) helped to finance the campaign. Bill White's claims forcedBath to admit in sworn depositions that he represented four wealthy Saudi Arabianbusinessmen as a trustee and used his name on their investments in return for a 5%commission on their business deals. At the same time Bath, the buddy of BoyGeorge, was both put on the CIA payroll by Father George to get involved with theArabs and the aviation business, and appointed by Salem bin Laden and other binLaden-connected Arabs as their Texas representative. This connection led to Salembin Laden investing in George W. Bush's Arbusto oil company.The allegations of Bill White that his former partner James Bath channelledmoney from Middle Eastern clients to American companies to influence thedecisions of the Reagan-Bush administrations were \"investigated\" by the FinancialCrimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a division of the Justice Department. But,"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre DisasterBorn to be king\t77of course, nothing came of it. White told a Texas court in 1992 that Bath and theJustice Department had \"blackballed\" him professionally and financially because herefused to stop revealing his knowledge of the Arab money paid into the bankaccounts of American businesses and politicians. At the time of this justiceDepartment \"review\" of Bill White's evidence, a senior position in the departmentwas held by Robert Mueller. This same Robert Mueller was appointed head of theFBI by George W. Bush and took over just two weeks before September 11th. This isthe FBI from which the official story of 9 / 11 has come. The head of the JusticeDepartment's criminal division under President Father George, which cleared majorplayers in the BCCI scandal, including Bush, was also ... Robert Mueller. Having afew little doubts about Mueller's FBI version of September 11th? Yeah, me too.Boy George, the bin Ladens, and the BCC1By 1977, using Bath as the middleman, Salem bin Laden was investing in Dubya'sArbusto drilling company. This association continued, not least through theIlluminati's BCCI, which provided \"banking services\" for the Medellin drug cartel,Khun Sa (a major player in the heroin trafficking out of Asia), Manuel Noriega,Saddam Hussein, and terrorists like Abu Nidal, who, according to the formerGerman Defence Minister and overseer of German intelligence, Andreas von Bulow,is an \"instrument of Mossad\", the Israeli intelligence agency.\" The BCCI was alsothe main route for the funds of CIA covert operations that involved the Iran-Contrascandal and the funding of Osama bin Laden and others in Afghanistan who wereresisting the Soviet Union occupation in the 1980s during the Reagan-Bush era. Theresult of this CIA funding through the BCCI and other sources was the creation ofthe Osama bin Laden network and the coming to power of the Taliban regime. TheBush family were massively involved with the BCCI and these super-rich MiddleEastern families, like the bin Ladens. Ed Rogers, Father George's White Housepolitical director, who sat in on presidential meetings, left to work for Sheikh KamalAdham, the American representative of the BCCI and significantly a former chief ofSaudi intelligence and a friend of Adnan Khashoggi, the infamous arms dealer.Khashoggi is a business associate of Father George Bush and one-time brother-in-law to Mohamed al-Fayed. When Father Bush was asked if he was concerned that asenior member of his staff had left to represent a Saudi sheikh accused of being akey player in the BCCI scandal, he said Rogers was free to do whatever he choseand Bush's only concern was that the White House was \"beyond any perception ofimpropriety\"' Note ... not beyond impropriety, just any perception of it. Rogerswas hired to ensure good communications between the sheikh and Bush. As aSenate investigation into the BCCI revealed, Rogers left the White House and waspaid $600,000 to do next to nothing. It was the same with his assistant, HaleyBarbour, who would turn up later as the chairman of the National RepublicanCommittee. The Senate investigation concluded that hiring Rogers and giving\"gifts\" of money to the president's son, George W. Bush, were designed to influenceFather Bush's policies in relation to the BCCI.35Like his father, Salem bin Laden diedin a plane crash near San Antonio on Memorial Day, May 29th 1988. It is amazing"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"78\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.how dangerous flying can be when you get involved with the Bush family and theirIlluminati associates. Indeed it was considered an unexplainable \"freak\" accidentwith bin Laden, a very experienced pilot, inexplicably turning his ultralight aircraftthe wrong way on take-off and hitting power lines. Or so the story goes.Bush associate finances bin LadenBush buddy James Bath made his fortune from commissions for investing themoney of Salem bin Laden and another Saudi who becomes very significant in thetale. This is Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, another investor in a George W. Bush oilcompany. Bin Mahfouz was the operational director of the BCCI and a controllingshareholder with a 20% stake between 1986 and 1990. He is one of the world'srichest men and ... a financial supporter of Osama bin Laden's terrorist network!His sister is a wife of Osama bin Laden, as revealed by CIA Director James Woolseyin his testimony to the Senate in 1998.;hKhalid bin Mahfouz and Salem bin Ladenwere closely associated and Dubya's close friend James Bath worked for both ofthem, as he did for Gaith Pharaon, the BCCI's front man in Houston's Main Bankand a close associate of bin Mahfouz. In 1978, Bath bought Houston's Gulf Airportfor Salem bin Laden and when he died in the \"ultralight crash\" ownership passedto bin Mahfouz. He has a big estate in Houston, the home base of Father George.Bath was also president of Skyway Aircraft Leasing Ltd, a Texas air chartercompany registered in the Cayman Islands, which was really owned by binMahfouz according to published reports in the early 1990s.\" There was a longassociation between Boy George's associate James Bath and bin Mahfouz. Bathreceived a \"loan\" of $1.4 million from him in 1990.Khalid bin Mahfouz is from the Yemen, as were the bin Ladens originally. Hewas for many years the banker to Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and to Father GeorgeBush. Bin Mahfouz was known as \"the king's treasurer\" in Saudi Arabia. Yet afterthe terrorist attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in the 1990s, whichwere blamed on Osama bin Laden, President Clinton's Secretary of State MadeleineAlbright informed the Saudi Defence Minister, Prince Sultan, that bin Mahfouz hadchannelled tens of millions of dollars into terrorist groups through accounts inLondon and New York. According toUSA Today,quoting \"intelligence sources\", binMahfouz and other Saudis combined to transfer $3 million to various Osama binLaden front operations in Saudi Arabia in 1999.'° The paper reported that a yearafter bin Laden was blamed for the attacks on US embassies in Africa, Khalid binMahfouz and other wealthy Saudis ordered the National Commercial Bank (ownedby bin Mahfouz and used by the bin Laden family)39to transfer funds to the CapitolTrust Bank in New York City. This money was deposited with Islamic charitiesconnected to the bin Laden network in the United States and United Kingdom.41The organisations alleged to have been used by bin Mahfouz and associates to fundterrorist groups, especially bin Laden, include: the London-based Advice andReformation Committee; Blessed Relief, an African aid group whose directorsincluded bin Mahfouz's son, Abdul Rahman Mahfouz; a Kenya branch of HelpAfrica People, controlled by people later convicted or indicted for the US embassy"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Born to be king\t79bombings in Kenya and Tanzania; the International Islamic Relief Organization,which has been linked with terrorist bomb plots in the Philippines and India; theKenya branch of Mercy International, a war and famine relief group where evidenceused to convict the embassy bombers was found; and a list of other organisations,some of which have been named by President Bush since September 11th as frontsfor terrorism (he should know).\"Here's another example of how small the world is at this level. The Capitol TrustBank through which at least some of these funds for Osama bin Laden are said tohave been channelled is run by bin Mahfouz associate Mohammad Hussein Al-Amoudi, who is also alleged to have funded bin Laden. Al-Amoudi's lawyer hasbeen Vernon Jordan, the close associate of Bill Clinton and friend of MonicaLewinsky. Jordan was for many years a senior executive in the law firm Akin,Gump, Strauss, Hauer and Feld in Washington, along with several close friends ofthe Bush family. In January 2000 Jordan moved to the New York investment bank ofLazard Freres, but retains close connections to the law firm he has served since1982. He also sits on the boards of major corporations like American Express, theRevlon Group, Xerox Corporation and Dow Jones.\" Akin, Gump represent someinteresting combinations of people and organisations. These include bin Mahfouzand Al-Amoudi, who are alleged to have funded Osama bin Laden; they alsohandle the affairs of many leading Saudis through the Akin, Gump office in thecapital, Riyadh; and they represent the Texas-based Holy Land Foundation forRelief and Development, which had its assets frozen by the US Treasury pending aninvestigation into alleged connections to the Palestinian terrorist group, Hamas.43Bin Mahfouz retained the services of Akin, Gump during the \"investigation\" intothe BCCI.\"The National Commercial Bank in Saudi Arabia, reported to be the world'sbiggest private bank, was owned by bin Mahfouz, but he was forced to step backwhen an audit by the Saudi government revealed that $2 billion was \"missing\".There has, of course, been much speculation into where, or more to the point, towhom, that money went. I emphasise again, the National Commercial Bank is oneof the major banks used by the bin Laden family empire and the royal family ofSaudi Arabia. Bin Mahfouz was put under \"house arrest\" and the last I heard hewas \"living in luxury at a military hospital in the northern city of Taif, where he isallegedly undergoing treatment for a drug problem\". Taif is only a short distancefrom the bin Laden family headquarters in Jeddah. Bin Mahfouz also had to handover the Irish passports he had bought for millions of dollars for himself, ten of hiswives, and business associates. Nothing really changed, however, because anotherfamily member, Mohammed bin Mahfouz, took over the National Commercial Bankalong with close family business associate, Mohammed Hussein Al-Amoudi, who isbased in Ethiopia and heads a vast network of companies involved in oil, banking,mining and construction. These include the Capitol Trust Bank that was named bythe Clinton administration as a vehicle for funding Osama bin Laden 's al-Qaedanetwork. The bin Mahfouz and Al-Amoudi families control three private SaudiArabian oil companies and are partners with United States firms in a series of major"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"$0\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.oil development and pipeline projects in central and south Asia. Of course, theBushes, Vice President Dick Cheney and many others in the US government areclosely involved with the oil cartel. The Mahfouz-Al-Amoudi companies, Delta Oil,Nimir Petroleum and Corral Petroleum, formed international consortiums withUnited States oil giants Pennzoil (Bush family), Texaco, Unocal, Amerada Hess andFrontera Resources. Unocal is a Texas-based group that has been planning to build amassive pipeline across Afghanistan, but could not do so while the Taliban was inpower. Despite their connections with Osama bin Laden, these US companies, binMahfouz and Al-Amoudi, have not had their assets frozen in the Bush sham to\"stop money reaching terrorist organisations\". The American publication,VillageVoice,was therefore right to conclude:\"It is most curious that the son of former CIA Director George Bush does business withthe brother of Osama bin Laden in the setting up of businesses which seem very tied tothe CIA - while at the same time a woman with CIA ties and who is married into thefamily of former CIA Director Richard Helms represents the Taliban, protector of Osamabin Laden. This coziness among the CIA and bin Laden families all suggest to me thatperhaps Osama bin Laden may still very much be a CIA-protected operative, and makesme very nervous about who really orchestrated the 9/11 attacks.\"45What a tangled web we weave ...Once again, bin Mahfouz, the financial supporter of Osama bin Laden, was aninvestor in a George W. Bush oil company. Dubya's original company, Arbusto,went through changes of name with each financial failure. It became BushExploration when Father George became US Vice President and in September 1984this survived only by merging with Spectrum 7 Energy Corporation. With BoyGeorge appointed president of Spectrum, this of course also failed, and mergedwith Harken Energy in 1986. He was a shareholder, director and adviser to Harkenand, a year later, with Harken now in trouble, along came the \"investment\" byOsama bin Laden supporter, Khalid bin Mahfouz.46He paid $25 million to acquire a17.6% stake in the company through his US representative, Abdullah Taha Bakhsh.Mahfouz at the same time was a 20% controlling shareholder in BCCI, which officialinvestigations revealed to be financing terrorist groups, unlawful \"intelligence\"operations and laundering vast amounts of drug money. Despite being a leadingfigure in the BCCI while it perpetrated the biggest financial fraud in history, binMahfouz escaped all liabilities, except for a $225-million-dollar settlement agreedwith New York \"prosecutors\". This was pin money for him. With the Bush familyso heavily involved in the BCCI it is not a surprise that it should be connected to thecompanies of George W. Bush.Hey, Jack's backAbdullah Taha Bakhsh also purchased a 9.6% stake for bin Mahfouz in the WorthenBanking Corporation in Arkansas, owned by another significant character in the"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre DisasterBorn to be king\t81story, Jackson Stephens, who funded Bill Clinton's presidential campaign and muchof his political career. Bakhsh's purchase was identical to the shares in Worthen soldby three investors, Bill Clinton, Pat Robertson, the television \"evangelist\" (seeChildren Of The Matrix),and Mochtar Riady, the head of an Indonesian family thathas close connections to the Chinese communists.\" Jackson Stephens was a majorfinancial supporter of Bill Clinton, but is also a close associate of the Bush family inAmerica's one-party state. He was also closely connected with the BCCI and theBush banker and bin Laden funder, Khalid bin Mahfouz. In a sworn statement forhis lawsuit against Father George, the former Green Beret, William Tyree, said thatStephens \"paid off politicians from Arkansas to look the other way and ignore theCIA cocaine operation at Mena, Arkansas.\"48In 1987, Stephens, who was alsolinked to the Clintons' Whitewater property scandal through the Worthen Bank,invested $25 million in ... Boy George's Harken Energy. The deal was set up inGeneva and the money paid through Union des Banques Suisses and Banque deCommerce et de Placements, a Geneva branch of the BCCI. The deal was signed byStephens and Abdullah Taha Bakhsh, the representative of bin Mahfouz. Stephen'scompany, Stephens Inc., donated $100,000 to Father George's re-election campaignin 1991, despite being a funder of Bill Clinton. His wife, Mary Anne Stephens, ranFather George's presidential election campaign in Arkansas in 1988 and when BoyGeorge was manipulated into the presidency with the fixed vote in Florida in 2000,Jackson Stephens made a considerable contribution to the cost of his inaugurationbash. Forget the \"two-party\" or \"multi-party\" state deal. It doesn't exist. These guysare masks on same face. When you observe the fundamental and constantconnections between the Bushes, the bin Laden family, their cronies and investors,and the BCCI, including its operational director Khalid bin Mahfouz, it is soberingto note that a 400-page French parliamentary report, published on October 10th2001, said that the Osama bin Laden financial network bore a striking resemblanceto that of the BCCI.Loser takes it allDubya's family and business connections made him a fortune from his failed oilcompany in its various incarnations. With Arbusto failing, he was made presidentof the company that bought it, Spectrum 7 Energy, and was given 14% of its stockwhile other Arbusto investors were paid 20 cents on the dollar. When Spectrum 7lost $400,000 in six months Bush sold to Harken Energy and again received a largestock holding and a big salary as consultant and director. While Father George wasUS President in 1990, his son's Harken Energy was given a lucrative contract by thegovernment of Bahrain even though Harken had never drilled a well overseas oroffshore. The deal was brokered in part by David Edwards, one of Bill Clinton'sclosest friends, and a former employee of Stephens Inc., owned by JacksonStephens. Clinton himself is a gofer for the Bushes and Rockefellers. The contractwas awarded to Bush's company thanks to Sheikh Kalifah, the Prime Minister ofBahrain, another BCCI shareholder.\" Jonathan Beaty and S.C. Gwynne in theirbook,The Outlaw Bank: A Wild Ride Into the Secret Heart of the BCCI,write that"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"82\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.\"Knowledgeable oil company sources believe that the Bahrain oil concession wasindeed an oblique favor to the president of the United States but say that SaudiArabia [home of bin Laden] was behind the decision.\"\" Choosing a small companywith no track record was indeed a strange decision unless you know thebackground and personnel. Harken immediately subcontracted the work to theCIA-connected Global Marine and no oil was found. Bahrain officials say they hadno idea that the President's son was involved with Harken when they awarded thecontract. No, honest, they really said that.Above the lawInsider trading - using privileged information to trade stocks - is strictly illegal andyet how can the following not be considered so? Two months before Iraq invadedKuwait on June 20th 1990, Boy George suddenly sold two-thirds of his stock inHarken Energy, and the 121,140 shares netted him $848,560 - that's $318,430 morethan they were worth according to Dr Arthur F. Ide, the author ofGeorge W. Bush:Portrait of a Compassionate Conservatives'Eight days after Bush sold his stock, Harkenannounced second quarter losses of $23 million, Saddam Hussein then invadedKuwait and the value of the company plummeted 75%. As Ide wrote: \"George W.broke the law to [sell his shares] since the transaction was an insider stock sale.\"52Bush was cleared, however, by an investigation by the Securities and ExchangeCommission (SEC), an Illuminati front dealing in financial law. It prosecutes thosethe Illuminati want to destroy and clears the ones they want to protect. AnAssociated Press report pointed out:\"At the time of the investigation, Bush's father was President of the United States andthe SEC was run by one of his biggest political supporters, Richard Breeden. The SEC'sthen-general counsel, James R. Doty, was another staunch presidential supporter whoas a private attorney was George W. Bush's lawyer when he purchased his share of theTexas Rangers baseball team.\"53Yet another stitch-up and there's more. Bush was defended in the investigationby the Dallas attorney, Robert Jordan. When he became US President, Boy Georgeappointed Jordan as his ambassador to Saudi Arabia - a country that was to becomeextremely important a few months later when the \"war on terrorism\" waslaunched. This is, of course, the base of the bin Laden family and other Bush andterrorism funders like Khalid bin Mahfouz. Jordan has no diplomatic experience,but that's not the point. As always it is his loyalty to the Bush family that counts.Must be genetic ...When faced with questions about his bin Laden connections, President Dubyadenied at first ever knowing his long-time friend and bin Laden family businessassociate, James Bath. This was an outrageous and a ludicrous lie. He then agreedthat Bath had invested in Arbusto and that he knew he was a representative ofSaudi Arabian interests (the bin Laden family and Khalid bin \"BCCI\" Mahfouz)."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Born to be king\t83Bush also lied to theWall Street journalwhen he said he had \"no idea\" that the BCCIwas involved in Harken Energy's finances. In fact, Harkeri s affairs were awashwith people directly connected to the BCCI. TheJournalquite rightly concluded that\"The number of BCCI-connected people who had dealings with Harken - all sinceGeorge W. Bush came on board - raises the question of whether they mask an effortto cozy up to a presidential son.\" ' In fact, it goes far, far, deeper than that. The Bushfamily is crooked to the core and the children have been brought up to be that wayDubya's brother Neil Bush was fined $50,000 in 1990 and banned from bankingactivities for his role in taking down Silverado Savings and Loans, a failure that costtaxpayers $1.3 billion and resulted from the \"Reaganomics\" policies of the 1980sthat were orchestrated by the real power in the Oval Office, George Bush. FatherGeorge was US President when Silverado collapsed. A Resolution TrustCorporation suit against Neil Bush and other officers of Silverado was settled for$26.5 million. He voted to give $100 million in \"loans\" (bad ones it turned out) totwo of his business partners while failing to tell his fellow board members atSilverado that they were his business partners. Federal banking investigators alsofollowed the trail of defaulted loans to Neil Bush oil ventures like JNB International,an oil and gas exploration company that was awarded drilling concessions inArgentina even though it had no experience of international oil and gas drilling.Heard that story somewhere before? Neil Bush now runs an \"educational software\"company called Ignite out of Austin, Texas, and in January 2002 he was the keynotespeaker at an \"international forum\" in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, home of the bin Ladenfamily, and they were the main backers of the event.\"The Carlyle Group - a name to rememberKhalid bin Mahfouz, the financial backer of Osama bin Laden and George W. Bush,is also an investor in the Carlyle Group, the international consulting and investmentfirm of Father George. It was founded in 1987 and named after the favourite NewYork hotel of the company's initial investors, the high-Illuminati Mellon family, theclose friends of the British royal family and the force behind the lie that fluoride isgood for you (seeAnd The Truth Shall Set You FreeandThe Biggest Secret).TheCarlyle Group also has very close links with the bin Laden family, who have beenboth clients and investors. Father Bush has been a paid consultant to the Bin LadenGroup. Reports in theWall Street Journalsay these Carlyle investments have beenearning the bin Laden family some 40% a year on their money since 1995.56So whenthe US boosts its military spending, as it has so massively done in the \"war onterrorism\", bin Laden family investments in a defence contractor like Carlyle clearlybenefit. According to theNew York Times:\"Carlyle has ownership stakes in 164companies which last year employed more than 70,000 people and generated $16billion in revenues. About 450 institutions - mainly large pension funds and banks- are Carlyle investors ... \"5'Carlyle owns a wide range of companies involved in\"health care\", real estate, the Internet, bottling plants, the media (including, it isreported, the French newspaper,Le Figaro),as well as companies producing tanks,aircraft parts and a long list of other military equipment. It is now a major player in"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"84\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.defence contracting and telecommunications and invests in companies that dobusiness with governments or are affected by government regulations. TheWallStreet journalcalled the Carlyle Group \"... a well-connected Washington merchantbank specializing in buyouts of defense and aerospace companies.\"58Almost two-thirds of Carlyle's investments are in defence and telecommunications companiesthat are fundamentally affected by changes in government spending and policybecause they know they can influence both, especially if one of your leading lightshas his son in the White House. Dubya, himself, was an investor and board memberof the Carlyle subsidiary, Caterair.Well, well, what a line-upFather George sat on the Carlyle board and is still very much involved as aconstantly active senior consultant who nets, apparently, between $80,000 and$100,000 for every speech he makes on its behalf. He is also the senior adviser toCarlyle's Asian Partners fund.\" Another Carlyle stalwart is James Baker, Bush'sSecretary of State at the time of the Gulf War, and the man who was allocatingcontracts to American corporations to clear up the oil fires in Kuwait even beforethe conflict began. Baker is on the Carlyle board, as is former Reagan-Bush DefenseSecretary, Frank Carlucci, who is the Carlyle chairman and managing director.Carlucci was number two at the CIA during the Vietnam War, assistant director ofthe CIA during the Jimmy Carter presidency, and both Secretary of Defense andNational Security Adviser to Ronald Reagan (George Bush). He is also a pastchairman of Nortel Networks Corp., which has been a partner of the Bin LadenGroup in telecommunication deals. Karl Evanzz in his book,The Judas Factor: ThePlot to Kill Malcolm X,6°says that Carlucci's appointment as consul and second-secretary of the US Embassy in Stanleyville, the Congo, was a cover for a CIAoperation that included the plot to assassinate the recently elected President PatriceLumumba in 1961. When someone is freely elected to serve the people and not theIlluminati they must be removed. Five months after Lumumba was assassinated,Carlucci was arrested, expelled from the Congo, and returned to the US. He wasexpelled again in 1965, this time from Tanzania, after he was implicated in the CIAassassination of the Burundi Prime Minister Pierre Ngendandumwe. This is theman who now heads the Carlyle Group with its fundamental connections to theBush and bin Laden families.In relation to the agenda behind the \"war on terrorism\", it is important to notethat Carlyle's Carlucci and James Baker are close friends and associates of thecurrent US Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. Baker was a classmate ofRumsfeld at Yale University and Carlucci was Rumsfeld's roommate at Yale.,'Secretary of State Colin Powell has also described Carlucci as his \"mentor\". Carlucciadmits that in February 2001 he met with Rumsfeld and Vice President DickCheney, the Gulf War Defense Secretary to Father George, to talk about militarypolicy. This was at a time when Carlyle had several defence projects worth billionsof dollars under consideration. How hilarious, therefore, are the comments ofCarlucci when he said: \"I've made it clear that I don't lobby the defense industry. I"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Born to be king\t85will give our Carlyle bankers advice on what they might do and whom they shouldtalk to. But I do not pick up the phone and say you should fund X, Y or Z.\"62Thenthere are the claims of David Rubenstein, one of Carlyle's founders and a formeraide to the Jimmy Carter administration that was served at the CIA by Carlucci.Rubenstein said: \"Mr [Father George] Bush gives us no advice on what do with thefederal government. We've gone over backwards to make sure that we do nolobbying.\"63To quote Santa Claus: \"Ho, ho, ho.\" But even funnier was the claim byDaniel A. D'Aniello, a Carlyle managing director, that \"We are greatly assisted byBaker and Bush ... [because] ... It shows that we are associated with people of thehighest ethical standards.\" That's about as wrong as any sentence has ever been inall human history. Charles Lewis, the executive director of the Washington-basedCenter for Public Integrity, hit the button when he said:\"Carlyle is as deeply wired into the current administration as they can possibly be.[Father] Bush is getting money from private interests that have business before thegovernment, while his son is president. And, in a really peculiar way, George W. Bushcould, some day [some day??] benefit financially from his own administration'sdecisions, through his father's investments. The average American doesn't know thatand, to me, that's a jaw-dropper.\"64The connections go on and on. Dallas attorney Robert Jordan, who defendedGeorge W. Bush against claims of insider trading and was appointed Bush'sambassador to Saudi Arabia, is a corporate lawyer in the Dallas office of Houston-based Baker Botts, lawyers to the Carlyle Group. The current \"Baker\" in Baker Bottsis James A. Baker III, Father George's Secretary of State and a major player in theCarlyle Group. Baker Botts has an office in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and the firm'sclient list includes \"more than half of the Fortune 100 companies\" and the Bush oilcompany Pennzoil. The former UK Prime Minister, John Major, was also hired as aEuropean consultant to Carlyle and was made chairman for Carlyle Europe in May2001. He has travelled with Bush promoting Carlyle interests. Major was PrimeMinister when the BCCI scandal broke in 1991, just as Bush was president in theUnited States. Lord Howe, who was Deputy Prime Minister and Home Secretary inMajor's government, also sits on Carlyle's European board. Howe made a crucialcontribution to the removal from office of Margaret Thatcher when the Illuminati,via its Bilderberg Group, had decided she had become a liability because of heropposition to the European superstate.Other Carlyle directors and consultants include Fidel V. Ramos, the formerPhilippines President; Richard Darman, Father George's former Budget Director;Robert Grady, former assistant to Father George; Park Tae Joon, former PrimeMinister of South Korea; Arthur Levitt, former chairman of the Securities andExchange Commission (SEC); Michael Orloff, former general director of the WorldHealth Organization; J.H. Binford Peay, retired US Army General; JohnShalikashvili, former chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff; Karl Otto Pohl, formerpresident of Germany's Bundesbank; and Sami Baarma, director of Pakistan's Prime"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"86\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.Commercial Bank in Lahore, which is owned by ... Khalid bin Mahfouz. Baarma(also Baarama) is a director of Lebanon's Credit Libanaise, which is owned by theMahfouz family. This Carlyle line-up of global influence also involves the past orpresent chairmen of BMW.; drug giant Hoffman-LaRoche; Nestle; LVMH-MoetHennessy; Louis Vuitton; and Aerospatiale, the French Airbus partner. Suchconnections have ensured massive growth for Carlyle. As theNew York Timesarticlenoted of Father George's role:\"In getting business for Carlyle, Mr Bush has been impressive. His meeting with thecrown prince [of Saudi Arabia] was followed by a yacht cruise and private dinners withSaudi officials, including King Fahd, all on behalf of Carlyle, which has extensiveinterests in the Middle East.\"And Mr Bush led Carlyle's successful entry into South Korea, the fastest-growingeconomy in Asia. After his meetings with the prime minister and other government andbusiness leaders, Carlyle won a tough competition for control of KorAm, one of Korea'sfew healthy banks.\"The article goes on:\"In a new spin on Washington's revolving door between business and government,where lobbying by former officials is restricted but soliciting investments is not, Carlylehas upped the ante and taken the practice global. Mr Bush and Mr Baker wereaccompanied on their trips by former Prime Minister John Major of Britain, another ofCarlyle's political stars. With door openers of this calibre, along with shrewd investmentskills, Carlyle has gone from an unknown in the world of private equity to one of itsbiggest players. Private equity, which involves buying up companies in private deals andreselling them, is a high-end business open only to the very rich.\"65Carlyle and the bin LadensThe Washington-based Judicial Watch, a law firm that investigates and prosecutesgovernment corruption, has highlighted the staggering fact, reported in theWallStreet journal,that Father George works for the bin Laden family through theCarlyle Group and has met with them at least twice in November 1998 and January2000. Baker and Carlucci have also made the pilgrimage to the bin Laden family'sheadquarters in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Father George issued a statement throughhis chief of staff, Jean Becker, to say he only recalled one meeting with the bin Ladenfamily - in 1998 - but when Becker was read Bush's thank you note after anothermeeting with the bin Ladens, she suddenly confirmed they had in fact met twice.Yes, and the rest. This connection with the bin Ladens has continued while Osamabin Laden has been the world's most wanted man and the FBI, according to newsreports, subpoenaed bin Laden family business records. However, Charles Freeman,president of the Middle East Policy Council and former US Ambassador to Saudi"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Born to be king\t87Arabia, says that two of the bin Laden brothers have told him since September 11ththat the FBI has been \"remarkably sensitive, tactful and protective\" of the familybecause of its \"long standing friendship with the US\". Another former US President,the Rockefeller-funded Jimmy Carter met with ten of Osama's brothers early in 2000on a fundraising trip for the Carter Center in Atlanta.\" He met with Bakr bin Ladenin New York in September 2000 and the bin Ladens handed over $200,000 to theCarter Center. Casper Weinberger, the former US Defense Secretary to Reagan-Bushwho was charged over Iran-Contra and pardoned by Bush, is now the chairman ofthe New York publisher, Forbes Inc. He confirmed that Forbes executives and staffalso made two visits to the bin Laden family headquarters in Jeddah.6'The CarlyleGroup, of course, is far from the only connection between the Bush and bin Ladenfamilies as we have seen, but this alone is outrageous in the circumstances. LarryKlayman, the chairman and general counsel of judicial Watch, said:\"This conflict of interest has now turned into a scandal. The idea of the President'sfather, an ex-president himself, doing business with a company under investigation bythe FBI in the terror attacks of September 11 is horrible. President Bush should notask, but demand, that his father pull out of the Carlyle Group.\"68But of course that didn't happen because both Bushes are up to their eyes in allthis and Daddy calls the shots anyway. The Carlyle Group, clients to Osama binLaden's family and associated with bin Laden funder Khalid bin Mahfouz, was oneof the major financial supporters (together with Enron) of George W. Bush's run forthe presidency! Wake me up.Looking after daddyThe LondonTimesreported an investigation into the illegal investment of publicfunds in the Carlyle Group through a web that leads back to George W. Bush.Reporter Tom Rhodes revealed the role of Wayne Berman, a former AssistantSecretary of Commerce in the Father George administration, who represents Carlyle.His company, Park Strategies, was involved in the transfer of $800 million in 1998from the Connecticut state pension fund into private ventures and $50 million of thiswas placed in a Carlyle fund. As a result of this information, Berman, who deniesany wrongdoing, resigned as a \"pioneer\", one of 400 elite supporters selected to raisemoney for Boy George's presidential campaign. Rhodes goes on to explain howDubya was also connected to investment of public funds in Carlyle. A month afterhe became Texas Governor, he was given a campaign contribution of $25,000 fromThomas Hicks, a multi-millionaire who Bush later placed on the Board of Regents atthe University of Texas along with Tom Loeffler, a former Republican congressmanand Washington lobbyist for Hicks, and Don Evans, an oil company executive, closefriend of Bush, and later his presidential campaign manager. With support fromBush, Hicks used his own investment company as the university's broker andformed a corporation called the University of Texas Management Company to investthe university's assets, totalling some $13 billion. Shortly afterwards, the Hicks-"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"88This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.controlled, Bush-appointed and supported regents handed over $10 million to theCarlyle Group, which employs his father! When Don Evans released the names ofthe Dubya's \"pioneers\" at the heart of his record-breaking presidential fundraisingcampaign, they included Steven Hicks (the brother of Thomas Hicks), Tom Leoffler,Wayne Berman, three partners in Vinson and Elkins (the law firm that serves ascounsel to the University of Texas Management Company), and two other men whobenefited from Texas University investments. Oh yes, and the Texas teachers pensionfund invested $100 million with Carlyle. The board that made this decision wasappointed when George W. Bush was Texas Governor.\"What a cheekWhen you see all the connections between the Bushes and the Middle Easternfinancial networks supporting people like Osama bin Laden, it is hard to evencomprehend the level of pure, undiluted, bare-faced, hypocrisy that George W.Bush had to summon in the wake of September 11th when he told a White Housenews conference about his \"crackdown\" on those who do business with terroristsand the supporters of terrorists. He said in the White House Rose Garden onSeptember 24th:\"US banks that have assets of these groups or individuals must freeze their accounts.And US citizens or businesses are prohibited from doing business with them.\" He saidit was \"a strike on the financial foundation of the global terror network. If you dobusiness with terrorists, if you support or succour them, you will not do business withthe United States.\"That applies to everyone it seems, except the Bush family, and their masters andcronies. I wonder what this means for the major British bank, Barclays plc, which isa \"core investor\" in a merchant bank set up on Guernsey in the Channel Islands in1996 by Khalid bin Mahfouz, Osama bin Laden's brother-in-law? Barclays went intobusiness with bin Mahfouz five years after he was involved in the world's biggestbank fraud, the BCCI.7°Saudi Arabia, a 51st state (one of many)The endless connections between the Bushes, the Saudi Arabian royal family, eliteSaudi business families, like the bin Ladens, and the terrorist networks, becomesunderstandable when you consider that Father George Bush, his masters andassociates, control Saudi Arabia. Cathy O'Brien, a mind controlled slave to peoplelike Father Bush and Dick Cheney for decades, saw at first hand what is reallygoing on behind the smoke and mirrors. She writes in her book,Trance-Formation OfAmerica:\"Saudi Arabia threaded in and out of most operations in which I was involved, primarilydue to their purchase and routing of weapons, drugs, and blond-haired, blue-eyedprogrammed children. According to George Bush's claims, Saudi Arabia was in essence"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre DisasterBorn to be king\t89a controlled financial arm of the United States. Saudi Arabian King Fahd and hisAmbassador to the US, Prince Bandar, provided a front for the unconstitutional andcriminal covert operations of the US. This included the arming of Iraq and theNicaraguan Contras; US involvement in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International(BCCI) scandal; and funding the Black Budget through purchase of our nation's childrento be used as sex slaves and camel jockeys.\"Since the US 'won' control of the drug industries through the so-called Drug Wars,Saudi Arabia played an integral part in their distribution. It was my experience thatBush's claim of having Saudi Arabia King Fahd as his puppet was, in fact, reality.\"71Cathy also tells of how she was forced by Dick Cheney, then US DefenseSecretary, to have sex with King Fahd, which, to a large extent, was part of theoperation to blackmail him into total compliance, should he ever think of refusingan order. Who are the financial advisers to the Saudi royal family? The CarlyleGroup. Who was their banker? Khalid bin Mahfouz, funder of Osama bin Laden.Are we to believe that the Bush family and their associates who have so muchcontrol over Saudi Arabia could not have caught Osama bin Laden years ago anddestroyed the business networks close to King Fahd that have funded him andothers? So why didn't they do it? Because they wanted that funding to happen andthey wanted bin Laden to be built up into a global monster because it suited whatthey had planned in New York and Washington for September 11th 2001.Anthrax scares are good for businessOh yes, some more facts about the Carlyle Group. As a major defence contractor, itbenefits massively from wars like those in Afghanistan and others in the \"war onterrorism\". According to the investigative journalist Sherman Skolnick, Carlyleowns a major slice of BioPort, the company that controls the US supply of theanthrax vaccine much used in the wake of September 11th when mysteriouspackages containing anthrax were posted to various addresses in America. Thevalue of the vaccine soared after the packages began to appear and one of the majorbeneficiaries has been ... yes ... yes ... the bin Laden family - another investor inBioPort!72So, too, is Fuad El-Hibri, a Saudi businessman close to the bin Ladenfamily, who is President and Chief Executive Officer of BioPort Corporation.\" Youcould not make this up. Another beneficiary is Admiral William Crowe, formerhead of the Joint Chiefs of Staff when American-produced weapons-grade anthraxwas being supplied to Saddam Hussein for use in the war against Iran. He served atthe Pentagon for a time under Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci, now chairmanof the Carlyle Group. Admiral Crowe, a member of the Illuminati's Council onForeign Relations and former US Ambassador to London, now owns 13% of BioPortCorporation and sits on the board. BioPort has one customer, the US Department ofDefense, and one product - anthrax vaccine. It is the only US Corporation with alicense to make anthrax vaccine and the licence was acquired in 1998 by buying thelaboratory where the vaccine is made, the Michigan Biologic Products Institute."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"90This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.President Bush is not keen for the people to know the background to BioPort and itsowners. Investigative reporter Sherman Skolnick writes:\"Under the disguise of invoking national emergency provisions, George W. Bush hasordered National Guard sentries to guard the BioPort facility in Lansing, Michigan. Bushhas ordered, under pretext of 'national security', that employees and officials of BioPortare forbidden to discuss with reporters, commentators, and researchers, the nature ofthe ownership of BioPort Corporation. This was done to preclude details of this privatecorporation from being publicly disclosed. This presidential edict was quietly put throughjust prior to the beginning of bombing by the US of Afghanistan. Despite this clamp-down on disclosure, some very patriotic employees of BioPort have informedindependent-minded commentators of the reputed ownership and operations details ofBioPort Corporation.\" \"BioPort's sole customer is the US Department of Defense, which has pouredmillions of dollars into the company to keep it going while it has supplied only 4%of the contracted vaccine. The Defense Department advanced $18 million oftaxpayers' money in 1999 and another $24 million in 2000 and yet now the investorsin the company, like the Bushes and bin Ladens, make fantastic profits because ofthe anthrax scare. Similarly, in 1996 when the Khobar Towers US military quartersin Saudi Arabia was hit by a terrorist truck bomb blamed on Osama bin Laden, hisfamily business made a fortune with the contract from the US military to replace itand build military barracks and airfields for US troops!75The anthrax drug, Cipro,which increased its sales by 600% after October 2001, is produced by the GermanIlluminati company, Bayer, formerly part of I.G. Farben, the very heart of Hitler'swar machine and the operation that ran the concentration camp at Auschwitz (seeAnd The Truth Shall Set You Free).Eberhard von Kuenheim, a former chairman ofBayer, works for the Carlyle Group. President George W. Bush has resisted allpressure to remove Bayer's patent and open the way for much cheaper genericversions, even though Bayer was apparently charging $350 for a drug you can buyin India for $10 to $20.\"Ken who?\"The Enron Corporation was the biggest financial backer of George W. Bush in hispresidential election campaign and has been financially supporting his career sincehe was governor of Texas. You would, therefore, expect that it would be a cesspit ofdeceit and corruption. It was formed in 1985 by the merger of Houston Natural Gasand Internorth, and was based in the Bush home base of Houston, Texas. Thefollowing year Kenneth Lay, a member of the Illuminati Trilateral Commission, andclose friend and associate of the Bushes, was made chief executive officer and laterbecame chairman. Enron threw money like confetti at Bush and more than 250senators and congressmen, and it bullied and manipulated a massive expansion ofits global holdings helped by the nose-in-the-trough politicians on its payroll acrossthe world. The technique was simple. The Illuminati forced the \"liberalisation\" and"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre DisasterBorn to be king\t91\"opening up\" of national energy supplies in developing countries and elsewhere,and Enron then secured the contracts to supply energy in those countries, oftenfunded by \"foreign aid\" and World Bank money. Everywhere they went, powerprices soared at the expense of local people and, in California, they conspired withother power companies to create false \"shortages\" and blackouts to justify massivemulti-billion-dollar investment by the state for increasing energy supply. However,Enron was using deeply corrupt accounting administered by the Arthur AndersenGroup to hide its fantastic debts and exaggerate its earnings by hundreds ofmillions. Eventually, like its banking \"mirror\" the BCCI, the house of straw camedown amid a frenzy of document shredding in December 2001 in the biggestcorporate bankruptcy in American history. Those responsible, like chairmanKenneth Lay and CEO Jeffrey Skilling, made multi-millions by selling their sharesat the top of the market before, as they knew, the share price would collapse to thefloor. Shareholders, including thousands of Enron employees who had beenencouraged to buy shares by the company, lost everything, including, forthousands, their jobs. Kenneth Lay alone sold shares worth $119 million before thecollapse and no wonder he could afford to donate $290,000 to the George W. Bushpresidential campaign. Skilling sold some 10,000 shares a week to secure $66.9million, and a group of 29 Enron executives and directors received $1.1 billion byselling 17.3 million shares between 1999 and mid-2001. They knew what wascoming, but they cut and ran while thousands of workers and small shareholderslost billions and many their retirement pensions.PaybackBut right up to the end, George W. Bush and Dick Cheney were trying to provideKenny Boy with value for money. Lay served on the Bush transition team after hisrigged November 2000 \"election\", and he helped to interview candidates for theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission. This oversees the gas pipelines andelectricity grids that are fundamental to Enron's business!76Curtis Hebert, thechairman of the Commission, said he was \"offended\" by Lay's efforts to lobby forEnron and Hebert later resigned.77Enron executives were appointed to prominentpositions in the Bush administration. Larry Lindsey, his Chief Economic Adviser,and Robert Zoellick, his leading trade negotiator, were both advisers to Enron andthe Secretary of the Army, Thomas White, was an Enron executive before joiningthe Bush administration.71Karl Rove, Bush's senior adviser, was an Enronshareholder who took part in many government meetings about energy policy. InFebruary and March 2000, soon after the Bush inauguration, Kenneth Lay metVice President Cheney and energy policy was modified to suit Enron. In May,Cheney issued a statement opposing caps on energy prices in California after amemo from Lay suggesting that he do just that. In all, Lay and Enron wereconsulted six times before Cheney announced his energy policy.79Cheney hasrefused to make public the documents and details of what was discussed at thesemeetings or even allow access to the General Accounting Office, the investigativearm of Congress. The White House \"energy task force\" was controlled by the"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"92\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.energy industry and part of its final report involving the policy on globalwarming was taken almost word for word from a policy paper issued by anenergy industry trade group.\"\"When the Enron scandal broke, of course, President Boy Bush did what the Bushfamily always do. He lied. He played down the relationship and referred to Lay asjust a \"supporter\". Charles Lewis, Director of the Center of Public Integrity, saidthere was no doubt about the very close ties between Enron and Bush: \"Enron wasthe number one career patron for George W. Bush. There was no company inAmerica closer to George W. Bush than Enron.\" \" Then in February 2002 some twodozen letters written by Lay to the then Governor Bush were released from Texasarchives after requests by the media and the watchdog group, Public Citizen. Theyinclude holiday and birthday greetings and get well notes. In one letter sent in 1997,Bush says: \"Laura and I value our friendship with you.\" A note in the same yearfrom Lay to Bush thanks him for his support for Enron's efforts to supply electricityfor Philadelphia, then governed by Tom Ridge, who was appointed head ofHomeland Security by Bush after 9 / 11. \"I very much appreciate your call to TomRidge a few days ago,\" Lay wrote, \"I am certain that it will have a positive impacton the way [Ridge] and others in Pennsylvania view our proposal.\"\"2Bush first metLay in the late 1980s and yet he said he only knew him after he became governor ofTexas in 1994. Eventually White House Communications Director Dan Bartlett hadto admit to theChicagoTribunethat the relationship between Bush and Lay probablybegan in 1987 and 1988 when they worked on Father Bush's presidential electioncampaign. \"He met him through his father and through his father's politicalactivity,\" said Bartlett. \"He does not recall specifics.\"\" I bet he doesn't. Bush andEnron were one unit and both share a life-long addiction to deceit and corruption.Other \"Enron\"-type accounting scandals have followed with companies likeWorldcom. This is, in part, a manifestation of the cesspit in which the globalcorporations operate, but it is also connected to the Illuminati plan to crash theworld economy by destroying confidence in it. With the economy in ruins theywould have a problem-reaction-solution to bring in their centralised control ofeverything. Incidentally, Richard Breeden, the man appointed court monitor ofWorldCom after the accounting scandal broke, was the Father Bush-appointedChairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission that cleared Boy George ofinsider trading with Harken Energy.Coup on AmericaAfter Boy George's business failures in the oil industry, in which he massivelybenefited financially thanks to other people's money, he turned to baseball. He anda group of partners bought the franchise of the Texas Rangers in 1989. Bush was thegeneral manager and this was part of the strategy designed to give him a positiveprofile in Texas with a view to him running for governor again. This he did with themoney power behind him and he was elected Governor of Texas in November 1994,after which he became the most enthusiastic enforcer of capital punishment inAmerica. The plan soon became clear - another Bush was being groomed for the"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Born to be king\t93presidency. He was re-elected governor on November 3rd 1998 with 68.6% of thevote. Two years later, almost to the day, he was the 43rd President of the UnitedStates, as I had predicted he would be some three years earlier. You only had toknow his bloodline and see the way his political profile was being raised to realisethat he was the chosen one. As a result, his presidential campaign broke all recordsfor fundraising and, before June 2000, he had attracted donations of $37 millionthanks to Enron, the Carlyle Group and the rest of the Illuminati campaign to puttheir man in the White House.His \"opponents\" were the Arizona Republican, John McCain, in the race for theRepublican nomination for president, and the then Vice President Al Gore for thepresidency itself. Both of these \"opponents\" knew they were not meant to winbecause Bush was the president-in-waiting. The Illuminati had enough dirt onboth of them to stop any true expose of George W. Bush during the campaigns.Gore is also bloodline although his DNA connections are not as impressive asBush's in the Illuminati genetic hierarchy. Again with Gore's insider knowledge ofthe Bush family he could have destroyed Dubya, but with Gore also heavilyinvolved in the same horrific behaviour, and well aware of the dire consequencesof crossing his masters, Bush was given an easy ride. In the same way, theDemocratic \"challenger\" Michael Dukakis knew his role and his place when hefaced Father George in the 1988 election before Bush gave way, as planned, toClinton. But even with all the aces in his favour, George W. Bush was such anunimpressive candidate that Gore won the popular vote across the country by halfa million in November 2000. In a truly representative election, that should havebeen enough to put Gore in the White House, but that wasn't the plan so it was notallowed to happen. The US system means that you win presidential \"points\" orvotes for an \"electoral college\" based on the states you win (some states are worthmore than others) and it all came down, infamously, to the result in Florida, thestate governed by Bush's brother, Jeb, who, naturally being a Bush, is anothermonumental crook. Even though the vote in Florida was so obviously rigged (toanyone with any brain cell activity), note how meekly Al Gore accepted it in theend and slipped quietly away. He knew what had happened and he knew why,and he knew better than to cause trouble serious enough to stop Bush taking thethrone. As Chicago investigative reporter, Sherman Skolnick, has pointed out, theFlorida judiciary is notoriously controlled by the CIA,' which, in turn, is veryclosely associated with Father George, who had his own son, Jeb, running Floridaduring the \"election\". Sorry Al, darlin', you never stood a chance, mate. Not thathe would have been any better had he won. A media consortium of theWall StreetJournal,Washington Post, New York Times,and CNN commissioned the NationalOpinion Research Council at Chicago University to inspect 170,000 disallowedvotes in Florida to prove who really won the 2000 presidential election. The resultswere ready by the end of August 2001 and media reports suggested that the countwould show that Gore beat Bush in Florida conclusively and should have beenpresident. But after 9 / 11 the media consortium said that the recount had beenpostponed due to a \"lack of resources and lack of interest\" in the story after the"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"94\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want.

A lack of interest in whether you have alegitimate president when he is taking you into an open-ended war across theworld? \"Our belief is that the priorities of the country have changed, and ourpriorities have changed,\" said Steven Goldstein, the Vice President of corporatecommunications at Dow Jones and Co, the owners of theWall Street Journal.\" Mybelief is that the media priorities actually remain very much the same -suppressing information that doesn't suit those in power. Little things, you know,like the fact that the president is an impostor.What happened in Florida was a coup on America and yet the vast majority whowatched it unfold had no idea that an unelected dictator had been imposed on their\"Land of the Free and Home of the Brave\" or, as someone rightly put it: \"The Landof the Fee and Home of the Slave.\" An investigation by the US Commission on CivilRights reported that Florida officials (controlled ultimately by Governor Jeb Bush)had been responsible for preventing citizens from voting in the election. The reportcalled this \"widespread\". The commission said the officials were \"grossly derelict\"in the way they conducted the election. Jeb Bush and Florida Secretary of StateKatherine Harris, both Republicans, were especially highlighted in theCommission's report for ignoring \"mounting evidence\" of problems with outdatedvoting technology in a number of counties, and for ignoring requests for guidanceand assistance from local elections officials. These \"technical problems\" were usedas an excuse to discount tens of thousands of votes, mostly those of black andimmigrant workers most likely to vote for Gore. Remember Bush eventually \"won\"the state by 537 votes. Yet in Palm Beach County, 19,000 ballots were \"double-punched\" and discarded, and in precincts heavily populated by Haitian-Americans,there were reports of ballots that were pre-punched for Bush. Tens of thousands ofother people were told they could not vote at all, even though they were carryingvoter registration cards. Palm Beach County was the location of a vote fraud in thelate 1990s in which the Republican mayor was forced to resign because he hadbenefited from an absentee vote fraud organised by his supporters. The FloridaDepartment of Law Enforcement arrested 58 people.Miami Heraldcolumnist DaveBarry wrote:\"Florida's No 3 industry, behind tourism and skin cancer, is voter fraud. Here in Miami,we've had elections where the dead voters outnumbered the live ones. Elsewhere in theState there have been reports of irregular voting procedures, including one Palm BeachCounty precinct where the 'ballots' given to voters were actually pizza coupons.\"a'Bush buys the electionBBCNewsnightreporter Greg Palast, a rare journalist worth the name, revealed thatthe Jeb Bush administration in Florida paid a private company called DatabaseTechnologies (DBT) $4 million to remove from the voter lists the names of peoplewho had committed serious crimes.\" Palast obtained a document marked\"confidential and trade secret\", which says that the company was paid the money"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre DisasterBorn to be king\t95to make telephone calls to verify they got the right names. But they didn't do it.Palast said there was nothing in the State of Florida files that says these telephonecalls were made and this wrongly barred thousands of Democrat voters who didnot have criminal records from voting in Florida. The first list from DBT of votersthey said should be barred from voting included 8,000 names supplied by GeorgeBush's state officials in Texas! They claimed these names were all serious criminalsbarred from voting, but, as Palast said, it turned out that almost none were. Whenthis was challenged, DBT issued a new list naming 58,000 felons, but one countythat checked the names relevant to its voters found that this list was 95% wrong.One of those named, Reverend Willie Whiting, had never spent a night in jail in hislife. Palast went to Tallahassee to question Jeb Bush's Director of Elections inFlorida, Clayton Roberts. \"We want to know whether George W. Bush won theelection or did brother Jeb steal it for him,\" Palast said. Roberts agreed to talk untilhe realised that Palast had a copy of the secret document relating to DBT and hecalled the State Troopers to remove Palast and his colleagues. Palast said that hehad not asked his most difficult questions before the troopers arrived. These were:Did Governor Jeb Bush, his Secretary of State Katherine Harris, and her Director ofElections, Clayton Roberts, know they had wrongly barred 22,000 black Democratvoters before the elections? After the elections did they use their powers to preventthe count of 20,000 votes for the Democrats? In Palm Beach, voting machinesmisread 27,000 ballots, but Jeb Bush's Secretary of State, Katharine Harris,prevented these votes from being counted by hand. She did the same in Gadstone,one of Florida's poorest and most Democrat counties, where the machines did notcount one in eight ballots. This same Katherine Harris was Co-Chair of the Bushpresidential campaign!The illegitimate presidentThe US Commission on Civil Rights confirmed that African-American voters wereten times more likely than white voters to have their ballots rejected and that an\"overzealous\" state-wide campaign to reduce voter fraud resulted indisproportionately denying eligible African-American voters from casting ballotson election day. It also said that African-Americans (overwhelmingly voters forGore if you look at history) were more likely to have been erroneously removedfrom voter registration rolls than Hispanic or white voters. The report criticisedlocal election supervisors in counties hardest hit by voting problems. It said theyshowed a \"lack of leadership\" in protecting voting rights. When the official countand recount using technology gave the election to Bush by a fraction, despite thosethousands of votes lost to Gore, the Democrats called for a hand count. This was theonly way to count the thousands of votes that were misread by voting machines.This was the only fair way to decide an election that was deciding the president.But the Bush camp was determined that this would not happen because they knewwhat the outcome of a fair count would be: Bush was going to lose. So on to thescene came ... oh yes, ladies and gentlemen please welcome ... James A. Baker III,the Secretary of State to Father George during the Gulf War, and a major force in the"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"96\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want.

Baker told the media inTallahassee, Florida, that he and the Bush camp were applying for a federalinjunction to stop a hand count. They were doing this, he said in typical Illuminatireverse language, to ... \"preserve the integrity and the consistency and the equalityand finality of the most important civic action that Americans take: their votes in anelection for president of the United States. We feel we have no other choice.\"R9Noother choice if they wanted Bush to win. They also knew that if they could have thedecision made by the Bush-controlled Supreme Court they were home. In the end,the issue did indeed go to the Supreme Court where, on December 12th 2000, theygave the presidency to Bush by five votes to four, voting on party lines. Thedecision was utterly perverse because they agreed that in order to have equal voterprotection in Florida the whole state should be recounted, but they ruled that therewas not enough time to do this - even though there were still weeks to go before theelectoral votes of all the states had to be officially accepted.\"' On this insane basisthey gave the presidency to Bush! This is how the man who has taken the worldinto a \"war on terrorism\" came to power.Another point about that Florida election. If you remember, the televisionnetworks that night first called Florida for Gore, then too close to call, and then forBush. Well this is what happened.91In the early hours of election night, November8th, the Fox News Channel, owned by Rupert Murdoch, declared that Florida hadgone for George W. Bush and that he was the new president. The other televisionnetworks repeated this within minutes. The man at Fox who recommended thisdecision was John Ellis, who headed the network's decision desk. Ellis, it turns out,is the first cousin of George W. Bush and brother Jeb, the Florida Governor, and, byhis own admission, he had been in constant contact with them all night.\"Investigative reporter Kate Randall revealed:\"Shortly after 6 p.m. two waves of exit polls from the Voter News Service (a consortiumset up by the major TV networks and Associated Press) showed the Florida vote goingfor Democratic candidate Al Gore. John Ellis received a call from the Bush campaign inAustin and told them the bad news. At 7.52 pm the major networks, including Fox,called Florida for Gore.\"Just after 8 pm, Jeb Bush phoned Ellis and asked him, 'Are you sure?', to whichEllis responded, `We're looking at a screen full of Gore.' It was at this point that theBush campaign - aided by information to which they were privy via their familyconnection at Fox - went into overdrive to reverse what appeared to be a Democraticvictory.\"93The Bush camp called a press conference at the Texas governor's mansion inAustin and said that, in their view, the vote was too close to call in Pennsylvaniaand Florida. The conference broke with previous election-night procedure in whichcandidates don't speak to the media until one of them has conceded. As Randallwrote:"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Born to be king\t97\"The actions of the Bush campaign constituted a bald-faced attempt to co-opt a servilemedia into stampeding public opinion in its favor. The TV networks broadcast theinterview even as large numbers of voters were still heading to the polls.\"94John Ellis, the Bush cousin at Fox, claims that exit polls by the Voter News Serviceshowed a change in Florida in Bush's favour between 8pm and 9pm. After that, allthe television networks withdrew the call for Gore and said Florida was too close tocall.Newsweekreported that, after midnight, Bush's lead in Florida began todiminish, but despite this, at 2.16am,Fox Newscalled Florida for Bush on thedirection of Bush cousin, John Ellis. Again, within minutes, the other networksfollowed. Ellis toldNew Yorkermagazine that 16 minutes before this decision he hadbeen on the phone to the Bush brothers: \"It was just the three of us guys handing thephone back and forth - me with the numbers, one of them a governor, the other thepresident-elect. Nowthatwas cool.\" Randall sums up this grotesque example ofmedia bias: \"In other words, the Republican candidate, and the governor of the statewhere the outcome of the race would be determined, had a direct line - throughtheir cousin - to a media outlet that would broadcast their 'victory' nationwide.\"\"With this announcement by Fox, Gore called Bush to concede the election and wasabout to make his speech giving the presidency to Bush when he heard that, in fact,Bush's lead (even with all those lost Gore votes) was down to a few thousand andfalling. Randall quite rightly asks: \"Did Ellis, fearing that the networks might moveFlorida back into the Gore column, decide to make a pre-emptive strike in the hopeof stampeding the other networks and conning Gore into making a prematureconcession? Did the Bush campaign have a hand in Ellis's call?\" It certainly helpedBush that's for sure. Mark Fabiani, Gore's communications director, said: \"To have anetwork like Fox call it and everybody follow suit was a tremendously damagingthing. It took literally 24 to 48 hours to convince people that Gore had won thepopular vote.\" But, of course, Rupert Murdoch, supporter of Tony Blair in Britain,defended Ellis. No one who believes in fair play and media impartiality would dothat, but this, it goes without saying, is not a problem for Murdoch.This is only a fraction of the horrific background to the Bush family that is takingthe world further and further into a war against freedom, decency, and justice. AlMartin, a retired Lieutenant Commander with the US Naval Reserves and NavalIntelligence, is the author ofThe Conspirators: Secrets of an Iran-Contra Insider.\"Martin claims to have seen at first hand the government drug trafficking, illegalweapons deals and an \"epidemic of fraud\" - corporate securities fraud, real estatefraud, insurance fraud and bank fraud.

It makes them feel at home, see. There are fewbetter examples of this than their fellow Bohemian Grove attendee, Dick Cheney,the White House Chief of Staff to President Ford; Father George's Defense Secretaryat the time of the Gulf conflict; and Vice President to George W. Bush during the\"war on terrorism\".Cathy O'Brien in her book,Trance-Formation Of America,tells of her horrificexperiences of Cheney when she was a victim of the Illuminati/CIA mind-controlprogrammes and Cheney was Defense Secretary to Father George, who sexuallyand violently abused her and her little daughter, Kelly. Cathy details in her bookhow she was involved in drug running operations under instructions from Cheney,some of which involved Bandar bin Sultan (Cheney called him \"the Sultan\"). BinSultan was the deeply corrupt US ambassador to King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, theGeorge Bush puppet and close associate of the bin Laden family and terroristfinanciers like Khalid bin Mahfouz. Cathy also describes the constant and sickeningbrutality that she and her daughter suffered from Cheney and Bush. This was justone occasion:\"Bush attempted to sell Cheney on the idea of pedophillia through graphic descriptionsof having sex with Kelly. Both were already sexually aroused from drugs and anticipation.Cheney demonstrated to Bush why he did not have sex with kids by exposing himself toKelly and saying: 'Come here.' Upon seeing Cheney's unusually large penis, Kelly reeledback in horror and cried `No!' which made them both laugh. Bush asked Cheney for hisl iquid cocaine atomizer as he got up to take Kelly to the bedroom. When Cheneyremarked how benevolent it was of Bush to numb her with it before sex, Bush replied:`The hell it is. It's for me.' He described his excited state in typical vulgar terms andexplained that he wanted to spray cocaine on his penis to last longer.\"Cheney said: `I thought it was for the kid'.102"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•\"Big Dick\" Cheney\t103\"Bush explained: 'Half the fun is having them squirm.' He took Kelly's hand and led heroff to the bedroom.\"Cheney told me that since I was responsible for Bush's assault on my daughter ... Iwould 'burn' (in hell). He burned my inner thigh with the fireplace poker and threatenedto throw Kelly in the fire. He hypnotically enhanced his description of her burning totraumatize me deeply. As he sexually brutalized me, I heard Kelly's whimpers comingfrom the bedroom. As her cries grew louder, Cheney turned on classical music to drownout her cries for help.\"'Another time, Cathy tells of what happened when she asked Cheney, amid yetanother brutal beating session, if she could go to the toilet:\"Cheney's face turned red with rage. He was on me in an instant, slamming my backinto the wall with one arm across my chest and his hand on my throat, choking mewhile applying pressure to the carotid artery in my neck with his thumb. His eyes bulgedand he spit as he growled: 'If you don't mind, I will kill you. I could kill you - kill you -with my bare hands. You are not the first and you won't be the last. I'll kill you any time Igoddam well please.' He flung me on the cot-type bed that was behind me. There hefinished taking his rage out on me sexually.\"2This is the same Dick Cheney who is US Vice President telling the world who wemust bomb and slaughter to win the \"war on terrorism\". It is also worth noting theunbelievable hypocrisy involved when Boy George, the son of a paedophile andassociate of Cheney, announced an initiative in August 2002 to \"protect America'schildren\". Richard Bruce Cheney was born in Nebraska in 1941 and was brought upin Casper, Wyoming. He is yet another of the clique to hail from Yale, home of theSkull and Bones Society, but he dropped out before eventually securing a degree inpolitical science at Wyoming University. Cheney then headed for Washington wherehe joined the Nixon administration as a special assistant to ... Donald Rumsfeld, theDefense Secretary today in the \"war on terrorism\". Rumsfeld at that time was thefirst director of the Office of [Illuminati] Economic Opportunity. When Nixonresigned over the Kissinger-engineered Watergate scandal in 1974 (seeAnd TheTruth Shall Set You Free),Rumsfeld joined the White House staff as assistant to thenew president, Gerald Ford, another abuser of Cathy O'Brien, and a man who,thanks to Watergate, never had to be elected and never would have been if thevoters had been given a say. That was another coup on America. Ford's intellectualcapacity was akin to that of George W. Bush and the famous saying that he couldn'twalk and chew gum at the same time was right on. Cheney moved with Rumsfeldand eventually became Ford's Chief of Staff between 1975 and 1977 when he wasstill in his early thirties. After the first of several heart attacks, he was elected asCongressman for Wyoming and remained in office until Father George made himDefense Secretary when he was elected president in 1988. Cheney is yet another ofthe bloodline cliques which are keen to send others into battle, so long as they never"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"104\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.have to go. He also avoided the draft to Vietnam when he was given defermentsbecause he was a student and a \"registrant with a child\". Just like President\"Dubya\", he told his Senate confirmation hearing that he \"would have beenobviously happy to serve had I been called\". Funny how they never are, though. In1964, Cheney married his wife, Lynne, another Washington insider. She was head ofthe National Endowment of the Humanities from 1986 to 1993 under Reagan andthen Bush (or, in truth, Bush and then Bush). She later became a senior fellow at theAmerican Enterprise Institute (where Cheney was also involved between 1993 and1995) and was co-host of CNN's appalling \"debate\" showCrossfire Sundayfor threeyears until 1998. Mrs Cheney was on the Lockheed Martin board from 1994 untilJanuary 2001 - the very company that the then Texas Governor George W. Bushtried to contract to run the Texas welfare system. Fortunately, public protestsstopped him. Bruce Jackson, the Lockheed Martin Vice President, was a financechair of the Bush for President campaign.Dick Cheney became best known during the Gulf Slaughter in 1991 when heworked to ensure the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians, nowmore than a million when you include the sanctions. Alongside him in thatadministration were President Father George (Carlyle Group), Secretary of StateJames Baker (Carlyle Group) and Colin Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs ofStaff. Cheney stated that his \"defence\" policy was \"Arms for America's friends andarms control for its potential foes.\" Which, of course, was baloney. The policy was\"Sell second-rate arms to countries that we can then demonise for being armed anddangerous, thus giving us the excuse to use our state-of-the-art weapons to blowthe shit out of their civilian population.\"Big Dick and big businessAfter Bush's pre-arranged defeat to his subordinate associate Bill Clinton in 1992,Cheney moved into \"private business\" to serve the Illuminati in another waypending his return to Washington with Little George nine years later. Cheneybecame fantastically wealthy as a director of elite companies like Morgan Stanley,Union Pacific, Procter & Gamble, and Ross Perot's Electronic Data SystemsCorporation. His most important appointment, however, came in 1995 when hebecame the Chairman and Chief Executive of the (yet again) Texas-basedHalliburton Oil. This was founded in 1919 and owns a highly significant subsidiarycalled Brown & Root. Cheney had no experience in the oil industry, but that's notwhy Halliburton offered him the job. He had other \"qualities\" that would expandtheir business. While Cheney was Defense Secretary (and before and afterwards),Brown & Root has been awarded hundreds of millions of dollars' worth ofconstruction contracts in war zones like Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti after they hadbeen devastated by US bombing and manipulation. In the same way, in July 1999, aBalkan Assistance and Reconstruction Conference in Washington DC was arrangedfor Balkan government officials to meet with executives from Cheney'sHalliburton/Brown & Root and other US corporations to plan the financial andpolitical needs for the occupation and operation of the Balkans. The technique is"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•\"Big Dick\" Cheney\t105this: you control the political decisions to start wars that suit your agenda; you lendthe governments money to buy armaments from you and they use your oil to fightthe wars; then, when all this has devastated the target country and its population,you get yourself awarded the contracts to rebuild what you have destroyed. Cheneyis the biggest shareholder in Halliburton with a stake of some $45.5 million and thecompany's board includes Lawrence Eagleburger, who held State Department postsunder President Father George and is an executive of the notorious KissingerAssociates (seeAnd The Truth Shall Set You Free).Paying for the privilegeHalliburton and Brown & Root have long used political patronage and funding toexpand business and profits. Brown & Root's ticket to the top came through itspolitical contributions to President Lyndon Johnson from the time he ran for Senatein 1948. TheAustin Chronicleonce called him \"the candidate from Brown and Root\"'Thanks to Johnson they made billions on government contracts, including thoserelating to the Vietnam War after Johnson reversed the policies of the assassinatedJFK and plunged America deeper into the conflict. During Vietnam, Johnson gavehis personal funders contracts for airports, pipelines and military bases.' Accordingto biographer Ronnie Dugger, author ofThe Politician: The Life and Times of LyndonJohnson,'much of the money he was paid by Brown & Root came in cash. \"It was atotally corrupt relationship and it benefited both of them enormously,\" says Dugger,\"Brown & Root got rich, and Johnson got power and riches.\" Using the same tactics,the contracts have flowed from government ever since. Michael C. Ruppert, a formerLos Angeles police officer, wrote in a study of Brown & Root:\"From Bosnia and Kosovo, to Chechnya, to Rwanda, to Burma, to Pakistan, to Laos, toVietnam, to Indonesia, to Iran to Libya to Mexico to Colombia, Brown & Root'straditional operations have expanded from heavy construction to include the provision oflogistical support for the US military. Now, instead of US Army quartermasters, theworld is likely to see Brown & Root warehouses storing and managing everything fromuniforms to rations to vehicles.\"6Both Halliburton and Brown & Root were funders of a now infamous companycalled Permindex, a British Intelligence front organisation headed by the CanadianLouis M. Bloomfield, which, it is now well documented, was the centralcoordinating network behind the assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas(Texas again) in 1963. (SeeAnd The Truth Shall Set You Freefor the detailedbackground.) Permindex also ran death squads in Europe, Mexico, CentralAmerica, the Caribbean and the United States. Clay Shaw is the only man to betried for involvement in the assassination, but the New Orleans District Attorney,Jim Garrison, failed to secure a conviction because the key prosecution witnesseshad this strange habit of dying from less than natural causes. Shaw, a Britishintelligence operative who worked for Churchill during the Second World War, rana division of Permindex in New Orleans. After the assassination, Halliburton"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"106\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.purchased Brown & Root. The connections from Permindex involved a stream offamous companies, banks and personalities, including the Bush family and theBronfman gangster family in Canada through its Seagram liquor operation.'Halliburton, at Cheney's say-so, bought and merged with Dresser Industries in an$8 billion deal in 1998 to create the biggest oil-drilling services company in theworld. George W. Bush's grandfather Prescott Bush was on the board of DresserIndustries for 22 years in his capacity as a partner in Brown Brothers, Harriman, thefunders of Hitler and the eugenics movement, which owned Dresser. The Presidentand Chairman of the Dresser board was Henry Neil Mallon, Prescott's Skull andBones buddy, who was among those involved in raiding the grave of the Apachechief Geronimo at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, in 1918 to steal his skull and take it back toSkull and Bones headquarters at Yale. It was Mallon, apparently, who burned theflesh and hair off the skull after Bush and friends had stolen it. Father George'scrooked son, Neil Mallon Bush of Silverado Savings and Loans fame, was namedafter the Dresser President, and Father George began his oil career with thecompany. There is, researchers suggest, a photograph that includes Prescott Bush,and George and Barbara Bush holding an infant George W. in front of the DresserIndustries executive plane.'Snouts in the troughCheney says he stands for small government and against government handouts.What he means, naturally, is he believes in that for everyone else, not himself.Halliburton received in five years some $4 billion (at least) in government contractsand loans insured by the taxpayer. The government, through the US Export-ImportBank, also guaranteed credits worth $489 million to a Russian oil company to thebenefit of Halliburton, through Brown & Root. This company, according to Russianand American sources and documents, is connected to drug trafficking andorganised crime.' Before Cheney took over at Halliburton, its business with the USDefense Department was worth around $300 million a year. When Cheney, theformer Defense Secretary, arrived their government contracts soared to more than$650 million, according to theBaltimore Sun.\"It's the same story with loans andguarantees from the government's Export-Import Bank and the Overseas PrivateInvestment Corporation: $100 million in the five years before Cheney, but at least$1.5 billion under his leadership. In return for political support and loan guarantees,Halliburton donated vast sums to political candidates and parties after Cheney'sarrival, and the lobbying budget doubled: $300,000 a year on lobbying politiciansbefore Cheney and $600,000 with him at the helm. Halliburton has also benefited.from US \"aid\" to various countries, which was then spent by the recipients on hiringHalliburton. TheLos Angeles Timesobtained State Department documents thatshowed how government officials helped Halliburton to win major contracts in Asiaand Africa.\" This is the way the Illuminati families and agents operate. They controlthe government decisions through the Illuminati one-party state and operatecompanies, like Halliburton and the Carlyle Group, which benefit from thosegovernment decisions and policies. This is how, once Cheney took over, Halliburton"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster\"Big Dick\" Cheney\t107was able to expand so rapidly and become the fifth largest defence contractor in theUS, so benefiting enormously from conflicts like the \"war on terrorism\". It has aworldwide operation involving 130 countries and is America's biggest non-unioncompany.\" No wonder Cheney was given a $34 million \"retirement package\" whenhe left in the summer of 2000 to be the running mate of Boy George. This was afterfive years on a salary of $1.3 million a year, plus bonuses of millions more, stockoptions worth some $45 million,\" and his sale of 100,000 Halliburton shares thatnetted him $5.1 million.14The \"retirement package\" also included 400,000 unvestedstock options due to \"vest\" over three years. This means that the higher the value ofHalliburton stock in this period the more money the Vice President will accrue, andthe oil industry depends very much on government policy. TheBaltimore Sunof June10th 2002 reported that Halliburton was being investigated by the Securities andExchange Commission for accounting irregularities. An \"aggressive accountingpractice\" at Halliburton approved by the (Enron/Worldcom) accounting firm ArthurAndersen was said to be behind the investigation, and involved allegations ofcounting $100 million in revenue that had not yet been received.Working with terroristsCheney's Halliburton has worked closely with some of the most appalling terroristdictatorships on the planet. He talks of \"constructive engagement\" in which youwork with such regimes and pass on American values. No need. The values ofsuccessive US and British governments are a mirror of those employed by thesevery terrorist dictatorships. For Cheney, this is nothing to do with \"values\" - hedoesn't have any - it is about working with anyone at any price to ensure moremoney and power, and the advancement of the Illuminati agenda. Dick Cheney wasthe Defense Secretary in the Gulf Slaughter supposedly aimed at Saddam Husseinin 1991. Yet he made big profits for himself and Halliburton after 1998 throughdeals with ... Saddam Hussein's Iraq. The LondonFinancial Timesreported thatCheney oversaw $23.8 million worth of contracts for the sale of \"oil industry\"technology and services to Iraq. He used Halliburton subsidiaries in France, Italy,Germany and Austria to hide the Cheney-Halliburton connection. Among thesecompanies were Dresser Rand and Ingersoll-Dresser Pump.\" These contractstogether were worth more than any other US company doing business with Iraq.TheInternational Herald Tribunereported that \"Dresser-Rand and Ingersoll-DresserPump Co., joint ventures that Halliburton has sold ... have done work in Iraq oncontracts for the reconstruction of Iraq's oil industry, under the United Nations' Oilfor Food Program.\"16A Halliburton spokesman admitted in theTribunearticle thatthe Dresser subsidiaries had sold oil-pumping equipment to Iraq via their Europeanagents. So get this: staggeringly, these Halliburton group contracts were helping torebuild the oil infrastructure of Iraq destroyed by the bombs dropped by UnitedStates planes commanded from the Pentagon by the then Defense Secretary DickCheney! At the same time Cheney was supporting sanctions against Iraq that haveso far produced around a million dead children. (What happened there to\"constructive engagement\"?)"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"108\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.The oil cartel benefits enormously from cheap oil pumped by Iraq in the UnitedNations' (Illuminati) \"oil-for-food programme\". Many Illuminati companies andfront men are benefiting from contracts with Iraq and other brutal dictatorshipswhile supporting sanctions that are killing thousands of Iraqi children every month.John Deutsch, the former head of the CIA, is a director of Schlumberger, the secondlargest US oil services company, which also does business, through subsidiaries,with Iraq. Halliburton has struck deals in Iran and Libya, even though they were onthe State Department's list of terrorist states. The Halliburton subsidiary Brown &Root was fined $3.8 million for violation of US sanctions against Libya. Cheney,incidentally, lied on US television (it comes so easy to him) when he was askedduring the 2000 presidential campaign on ABC'sThisWeekprogramme aboutHalliburton's deals with Iraq while he was in charge. He had this brief exchangewith interviewer Sam Donaldson, who then just let the matter drop:Donaldson: \"I'm told, and correct me if I'm wrong, that Halliburton, throughsubsidiaries, was actually trying to do business in Iraq?\"Cheney: \"No. No. I had a firm policy that I wouldn't do anything in Iraq - evenarrangements that were supposedly legal.\"What's that they say? Liar, liar, pants on fire? The Gore camp didn't raise thisexplosive information because they were up to their eyes in corruption too.Anything goesA number of pressure groups have sought to expose the support by Halliburtonunder Cheney's leadership of the brutal military dictatorship in Burma throughtheir involvement in pipeline construction. Among Halliburton's partners,according to published reports, has been the British company Alfred McAlpine.Readers of my other books, likeThe Biggest Secret,will need no introduction to theMcAlpine family. EarthRights, the human rights group based in Washington DC,condemned Cheney's Halliburton for two pipeline projects in Burma, the buildingof which led to rape, murder, indentured labour, the forced relocation of villagesand other crimes against humanity.\" The regime in Burma (also known asMyanmar) has been condemned constantly by the U.N. General Assembly, theInternational Labor Organization, Amnesty International, the European Union andthe US government, which withdrew its ambassador and imposed sanctions.Funnily enough, these sanctions laws specifically exempt the work that Halliburtondoes. Katie Redford, a human rights lawyer for EarthRights, said: \"Halliburtonpartners and subsidiaries, both before and during Dick Cheney's tenure as CEO,have been contractors for pipeline projects that have led to crimes against humanityin Burma.\"18The International Labor Organization said the junta in Burma is guiltyof \"an international crime\", possibly \"a crime against humanity\", through itsexploitation of forced child labour. Tens of thousands of people have been abused,murdered and driven from their homelands by the Burmese army, thousands have"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•\"Big Dick\" Cheney\t109been tortured, and the jails are full of political prisoners. The junta is also one of theworld's major producers and traffickers of heroin. All this matters not a jot to DickCheney. In fact to him it will be all the more reason to get involved. Also workingwith the Burmese terrorists on the oil pipelines has been Unocal (Union Oil ofCalifornia) - the company that proposed a pipeline across Afghanistan, but said theTaliban had to go before it could happen.Cheney sought to overcome any obstacles to his company's business dealings withone of the world's most oppressive regimes by using USA-Engage, the lobbyinggroup that opposed investment sanctions against Burma. He was also on the board ofthe National Foreign Trade Council that helped to pressure the Supreme Court tooverturn a Massachusetts state law that imposed penalties on companies trading withBurma. When it suits Cheney's agenda he is against even financial sanctions againstan oppressive terrorist regime. When it suits him another way, he is in favour of blitzbombing the country and killing thousands of civilians, as in Iraq and Afghanistan.\"Halliburton has both denied involvement in Burma and said that it has not tried tohide its involvement. Go figure.Wall Street Journalreporter Peter Waldman points outthat when Halliburton proclaimed its \"success story\" in December 1996 with a pressconference to announce several big contracts in Asia and Europe there was nomention of one of their biggest deals of the year - in Burma.\" A spokeswoman forHalliburton said she was not able to establish why the company failed to mention theBurma contract for its subsidiary, European Marine. I think I can help her there. Shealso declined to explain the massive revenue increase - some 77% - for EuropeanMarine in 1997, the year that most of the Burma work was done. I'm sure I can be ofsome assistance to her there, too. The Halliburton contract was mostly for work onthe pipeline offshore and the company claimed that it had no dealings with theBurmese people or the military. This is simply not true. A 1996 report by the U.N.Special Rapporteur on Burma, Judge Rajsoomer Lallah of Mauritius, revealed thatpeople were forced to work offshore as well. He found that in 1995 the militaryordered about 200 villagers to go to Heinze Island, an uninhabited shoal in theAndaman Sea where Burmese forces set up a base camp to guard construction workon the offshore pipeline. Peter Waldman told the story in hisWall Street Journalreport:\"On Heinze Island, Judge Lallah found, the villagers were required to work for two weekswithout pay, clearing land, building bamboo barracks and constructing a helicopter padhigh atop a steep hill - probably for later use by the Western companies that built thepipeline, according to Burmese human-rights monitors. The villagers were forced to paytheir own transportation costs to the island; those who refused to go were arrested andsent into rebellious areas to serve as porters for the military, Judge Lallah wrote.\"21...and there's moreBurma is only one in a long list of Cheney-Halliburton deals with dubious andterrorist regimes.

EarthRightsrevealed that a Halliburton contract with Indonesia was cancelled by thegovernment when they investigated those that had been corruptly awarded. Onecorporate watchdog organisation in Indonesia said that Halliburtori s engineeringdivision, Kellogg Brown & Root, was among 59 companies that used \"collusive,corruptive and nepotistic practices\" with the family of the former presidentSuharto, a vicious and corrupt dictator installed by British and Americanintelligence to serve the interests of the corporate giants owned by the Illuminati.22That's why Indonesia is now one of the sweatshop capitals of the world wherepeople living in abject poverty work a fantastic number of hours a week for pitifulpay so that big-name clothing and sportswear companies can accrue staggeringprofits by making the products there for next to nothing while selling them for highprices in the West. It's called \"globalisation\" and \"free trade\".In Nigeria, Halliburton worked with Shell and Chevron, which were bothimplicated in gross violations of human rights and the environment. (BritishPetroleum, Esso, Du Pont, ERAP, Texaco, and Total also have interests in Nigeria.)Cheney's firm increased its involvement there after the military dictatorshipexecuted several environmental activists and violently prevented protests againstthe oil industry. Halliburton was accused of complicity in the shooting of aprotestor by Nigeria's Mobile Police Unit. In another incident, highlighted by theNew York-based pressure group, Human Rights Watch, soldiers using a Chevronhelicopter and Chevron boats attacked villagers in two small communities in DeltaState, Opia and Ikenyan. They killed at least four people and burned most of thevillages to the ground. More than 50 people were still missing, Human RightsWatch reported. Chevron, who merged with Texaco a month after 9/11, claimed itwas a \"counterattack\" resulting from a confrontation between local youths andsoldiers at a Chevron drilling rig. Community members denied there was any suchconfrontation. Condoleeza Rice, the current US National Security Adviser to Bushand Cheney, was a director of Chevron from 1991 and she took charge of publicpolicy for the board. She even had a Chevron oil tanker named after her. Rice wasinvolved in negotiating Chevron investments in the vast untapped reserves of oil inthe Caspian Sea region before leaving to join her long-time buddy, George W. Bush.As National Security Adviser she is very much involved in the \"war on terrorism\",which has removed the Taliban regime and opened the way for oil and gaspipelines across Afghanistan. These are the very pipelines designed to tap the vastgas and oil reserves around ... the Caspian Sea.It's the oil, stupidBefore we can understand one (of many) reasons for September 11th and the \"war onterrorism\" we have to understand the plans of the Illuminati with regard to thefantastic oil and gas reserves of the Caspian Sea region.

The biggest Caspian fields are inKazakhstan and Azerbaijan (both in Halliburton's portfolio, and Cheney sat on thestate of Kazakhstan's Oil Advisory Board). Lesser reserves are located in Georgia,Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Armenia. The projected value of this, based onaverage prices in the 1990s, is $5 trillion, a very conservative estimate. This is theregion in which the United States is locating troops in the name of the \"war onterrorism\". The real reason is to secure control of the oil and gas reserves and thepipelines that will take them to market. William Ramsay, a US Deputy AssistantSecretary of State for Energy, Sanctions and Commodities, said that Caspian oil is\"crucial to the world energy balance over the next 25 years.\" He also revealed that:\"... there already exists a kind of outline of a new Silk Road running through theCaucasus and beyond the Caspian.

Doug Bereuter, Chairman of the US House [ofRepresentatives] Sub Committee on Asia and the Pacific, confirmed that Americanpolicy goals in this region are the \"independence\" of the new states and their ties tothe West (yeah, right), breaking Russia's monopoly over oil and gas transport routes,encouraging the construction of East-West pipelines that do not transit Iran, anddenying Iran dangerous leverage over the central Asian economies.\" ResearcherGeorge Draffan wrote in an article on the battle for Caspian oil:\"The 1995 Dayton Accords led to a major NATO military operation to `pacify' Bosnia-Herzegovina. For the multinational corporations working alongside NATO, one of themost important rewards will be the construction of a trans-Balkan pipeline to bring oilfrom the Caspian Sea region to Europe.\"The European Union, the US government, and a gang of multinational corporations(including BP, Amoco, Exxon, Unocal, Caterpillar, Halliburton/Brown & Root, andMitsubishi) are using all the military, political, and economic tools at their disposal todestroy and recreate the infrastructure and economy of south-eastern Europe in theirown image. The conflicts of interest between government officials and corporateexecutives are blatant and revealing.\"Recent NATO military action in Yugoslavia is part of a long strategic (economic) battleto control the Balkans. The current focus is to secure oil and gas pipeline routes fromthe oilfields of the Caspian Sea to the consumers of Europe. Multinational oilcorporations from the US, Britain and other European countries, and Russia are signingmultibillion-dollar contracts with Kazakhstan.\"27This includes Cheney's Halliburton and, incidentally, all the US Army camps inBosnia for the \"peacekeeping\" operations are built and run by Halliburton's majorsubsidiary Brown & Root. War is so great for business. Condoleezza Rice'sChevronTexaco is leading a Caspian Pipeline Consortium developing Caspian-Kazakhstan oil deposits. Others in the trough are BP-Amoco, Exxon-Mobil andUnocal. They are seeking to access these reserves from Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan andTurkmenistan, the three countries that surround the Caspian together with Russiaand Iran. The Russians want a pipeline north from the Caspian into their territory tothe Black Sea. Russian military action, claimed by President Putin to be a responseto Chechnya and al-Qaeda terrorism, has \"coincidentally\" taken place near theprojected routes of the pipelines. Putin is a \"former\" KGB operative and head of theFederal Security Service (FSB) and anything he says should be disbelieved by reflexaction.When you look at the frenzy to control and access these oil and gas reserves,the pattern of conflict and terrorism across this whole Middle East and Caspianregion starts to make coordinated sense. Author Michael Griffin wrote inReapingtheWhirlwind\"that the Taliban's rise to power in Afghanistan can be linked to a\"single, golden theme\", which he identified in places like Chechnya, Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia and Turkish Kurdistan:"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•\"Big Dick\" Cheney\t113...\"each represented a distinct, tactical move, crucial at the time, in discerning whichpower would ultimately become master of the pipelines which, some time in thiscentury, will transport the oil and gas from the Caspian basin to an energy-avid world.\"29Different place, same namesThe oil cartel and its political cronies and associates are working together tomaximise their power and profits. One example is the Azerbaijan InternationalOperating Company (AIOC), which is a consortium involving the country's state oilcompany together with Pennzoil (Bush), Unocal, Exxon, British corporations BP-Amoco and Ramco Khazar, Lukoil (Russia), Den Norske Stats Olieseiscap(Norway), Turkie Petrollari (Turkey), Itochu (Japan) and Delta Nimir Khazar (SaudiArabia). Note that Pennzoil, a major player in the project, was created when FatherGeorge Bush's Zapata Oil took over Penn Oil in 1963. Baker and Botts, the law firmnow headed by James Baker, Bush's Carlyle Group associate, handle Pennzoil'slegal affairs. Thomas Petzinger, a business journalist on theWall Street Journal,would later write: \"For 25 years, the internal legal department at Pennzoil had beenalmost indistinguishable from Baker and Botts.\"30Pennzoil's partner in the project,Delta Nimir, is controlled by our old friends Mohammed Hussein Al-Amoudi andKhalid bin Mahfouz, both of whom have financial ties to \"Osama bin Laden's\" al-Qaeda. Bin Mahfouz has funded George W. Bush's oil company and the CarlyleGroup of Father George. Other business partnerships involving bin Mahfouz, Al-Amoudi, and leading US oil giants include the following: the Nimir Petroleum(Mahfouz family) deal with ChevronTexaco to develop massive oil fields inKazakhstan that are said to contain up to 1.5 billion barrels of oil; the Delta Oil (Al-Amoudi family) partnership with Amerada Hess to develop oil fields in Azerbaijan;and Delta-Hess is part of a consortium hoping to build a $2.4 billion oil pipelinefrom Azerbaijan to Turkey.One of the directors of the US and Saudi-dominated Azerbaijan InternationalOperating Company is Brent Scowcroft, a former US National Security Adviser, anexecutive of Kissinger Associates, and a very close associate of Father George Bush.The plans of this consortium involve a thousand-mile pipeline from Baku on theCaspian across Azerbaijan and Georgia to the Turkish port of Ceyhan on theMediterranean, which was projected to cost $3 billion. Oil is a main reason (alongwith drugs) for the Turkish and other attacks on the lands of the Kurds and themassive expansion of the Turkish armed forces. Turkey has already murderedthousands of Kurds, destroyed thousands of villages and produced millions ofrefugees. The horrors of September 11th have provided the excuse for both Britishand American forces to be dispatched to the very region necessary to secure controlof the Caspian oil reserves and pipeline projects and for enormous increases inspending on \"defence\" and \"security\". As I was writing this chapter, PresidentBush announced a $48 billion increase in US defence spending to $379 billion andsaid he would spend whatever it takes to keep the American people safe. What'sthat about there being no money for the poor and hungry? These vast increases"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"114\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want.

Ethnic cleansing of Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous region of Azerbaijan, has led to sanctions and restrictionson US aid to the country. This was made law through section 907 of the 1992Freedom Support Act. Cheney has pressed for the repeal of this section to releasefunds for the oil cartel's operations in Azerbaijan and has lobbied constantly forsanctions to be lifted on Iran and other countries to ease through the Illuminati oilagenda he represents. He is also among those lobbying for the Azerbaijan-Turkeypipeline on behalf of the Azerbaijan International Operating Company. His fellowlobbyists include James Baker, Father George's Secretary of State, oil companylawyer, and director of the Carlyle Group; Zbigniew Brzezinski, National SecurityAdviser to Jimmy Carter and founder of the Illuminati's Trilateral Commission;Lloyd Bentsen, former US Secretary of the Treasury; John Sununu, former WhiteHouse Chief of Staff to George Bush; Tim Eggar, the former British Energy Ministerand now CEO of Britain's Monument Oil; Malcolm Rifkind, the former BritishForeign Secretary and now a director of the British oil corporation, Ramco; oh yes,and Richard Secord, the former US Air Force Major General charged for his part inFather George's Iran-Contra affair, has been helping to train the Azerbaijani army.By 1997, Pennzoil, Unocal, Amoco and Exxon had invested $5 billion inAzerbaijan and, as we have seen so many times, forcibly controlling the populationto ensure unchallenged control for the oil cartel is a constant strategy. Compliantdictatorships are good for business and I include \"democracies\" in that also. TheAzerbaijan government is now serving the interests of this American and Britishtakeover of the Caspian region by selling off ports, railroads, the national airline,airports and other state-run enterprises to \"foreign investors\". It is an identical storyin the Balkans where the same thing is happening. Governments are installed aftermanipulated wars that will sell off major state assets to the Illuminati corporationsand award contracts to their companies for \"reconstruction\". Contracts for theBalkan region, are estimated to be worth 30 billion. Then there is the money(taxpayers money) paid out for \"reconstruction\" and \"aid\" by the World Bank andthe International Monetary Fund (IMF), both of which are 100% Illuminati (seeAndThe Truth Shall Set You Free).Most of this money also ends up with the corporationsand this is why the projects funded by this diabolical duo are designed to benefitbusiness interests and not local populations. NATO, the world army in all butname, is nothing more than the means for the Illuminati cartels to bully and bombtheir targets into submission so this process can unfold - that's the real reason forthe Balkan occupation by foreign troops.This strategy was promoted by Zbigniew Brzezinski, the founder of the TrilateralCommission and major Illuminati insider, in his 1997 bookThe Grand Chessboard.He"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster\"Big Dick\" Cheney\t115said that control of Uzbekistan was the key to dominating the region and its oil andgas reserves. This is why the US has had \"military advisers\" in Uzbekistan for along time and this \"support\" has been increased still further in the \"war onterrorism\".Writing of the need for the United States to dominate the region,Brzezinski says: \"The three grand imperatives of imperial geostrategy are toprevent collusion and security dependence among the vassals, to keep tributariespliant and protected, and to keep the barbarians from coming together.\"31I thinkdivide and rule would put it more succinctly. An article by writer Nicholas Lemannin theNew Yorkeralso revealed that after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989Dick Cheney formed a group to plan a strategy for the 1990s and beyond.\" Thisgroup included the current Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, the currentDeputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, the current Secretary of State ColinPowell, and Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, currently Cheney's chief of staff. The aim was to\"shape\" the world in their desired image or, as another member, Zalmay Khalilzad,put it ... to \"preclude the rise of another global rival for the indefinite future\".Lemann says he was shown a copy of the document Cheney's group put togethercalledDefense Strategy for the 1990s: The Regional Defense Strategy, Secretary of Defense,Dick Cheney, January 1993.This was the month that Bill Clinton was inaugurated,and Cheney and Father Bush left the White House. This \"strategy\", planned in theearly 1990s, is pretty much what the Bush and Cheney government is doing today -a government that includes the key people who put the document together. The\"war on terrorism\" was a response to September 11th? Ha, ha, ha. Whoop, whoop,whoop. It's the way they tell 'em.So why Afghanistan?All of this brings me to Afghanistan and the Texas-based oil giant Unocal, one of theworld's leading independent natural gas and crude oil exploration and productioncompanies. It has been a project-partner many times with Cheney's Texas-basedHalliburton. The Burma pipeline is one example of this and as Cheney said in his1998 speech to the \"Collateral Damage Conference\" presented by the Washington\"think tank\", the Cato Institute: \"About 70 to 75% of our business is energy related,serving customers like Unocal, Exxon, Shell, Chevron and many other major oilcompanies around the world.\" Both Halliburton and Unocal have business andcrony connections to the Bush family, as indeed do Chevron, Shell, and Exxon cometo that. In October 1997, Unocal led an international consortium that beat offcompetition from the Argentine company, Bridas, to sign a $2 billion contract withTurkmenistan for the CentGas project (Central Asia Gas), a massive pipeline thatincluded 750 metres across western Afghanistan. It would connect the vast naturalgas reserves of Turkmenistan (possibly the world's biggest) to a plant and ports onthe Arabian Sea coast of Pakistan - yet another military dictatorship controlled bythe \"West\" (Illuminati). An oil version was also planned and extensions into Indiawere being considered. How fascinating that in that same month, on October 27th1997, a press release from Cheney's Halliburton announced that the company hadreceived a Letter of Intent from Petronas Carigali (Turkmenistan) to provide"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"116\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want.

It went on:\"Halliburton, in conjunction with alliance partners, Dresser Industries and WesternAtlas, will provide a combination of 10 services ... Halliburton will be the leadcontractor and project manager in addition to providing technical services. The valueof the award is estimated to be US $30 million for the total project.\" This no doubtwas Halliburton's contribution to the Unocal pipeline across Afghanistan(Figure 9).Taliban we love youTurkmenistan's dictator President Niyazov said he had a promise of support for thepipeline from both the ruling Taliban and from anti-Taliban factions in Afghanistan.Turkmenistan's official negotiator on the pipeline project was Yosef Maiman, a\"former\" agent with the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, which, at the highestlevel, is the same organisation as the CIA, British intelligence, and so on. TheTaliban were keen to go ahead because it would net them some $100 million a year,but to make the project work Unocal needed the US State Department to formallyrecognise the Taliban government that had seized power with it's usual extremeviolence in 1996 from the factions of the Mujahadin that had fought, with CIAsupport, to remove the Soviet Union from the country. The Taliban killed and"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster\"Big Dick\" Cheney\t117castrated the former president Najibullah, and hung his body and that of hisbrother from traffic lights at the entrance to the Presidential Palace. In September1996, a day after the Taliban took power in Kabul, a US State Departmentspokesman, Glyn Davies, said that the United States saw \"nothing objectionable\" inthe Taliban inflicting its strict interpretation of Islamic law. Unocal and partnershired some big names to press the case for a deal with the Taliban. Among themwere Henry Kissinger, the former Secretary of State and one of the major Illuminatimanipulators of the past 40 years; Robert Oakley, the US Ambassador to Pakistanduring the Reagan and Bush administrations; and the Afghan-born ZalmayKhalilzad, a former adviser on Afghanistan in the Reagan (Bush) State Department.This is the same man appointed by President George W. Bush as Special Envoy toAfghanistan and Khalilzad is a former adviser to Unocal on the pipeline project!The journalist and cartoonist, Ted Rall, says that Khalilzad worked for the ReaganAdministration in arming the CIA-funded Mujahadin during the Soviet occupationof Afghanistan. This was the period when the Osama bin Laden network wasformed with American government money and it eventually led to the coming topower of the Taliban. Khalilzad was also part of Dick Cheney's \"strategy group\" inthe early 1990s and argued that it was \"vital\" to prevent a rival to the United States'supremacy from emerging and \"to be willing to use force if necessary.\"33When theTaliban were removed by the \"war on terrorism\" following 9/11, the head of thenew government in Afghanistan was named as Hamid Karzai who, according tothe French publicationLe Monde, isa former consultant to ... yes ... Unocal.' RobertOakley was also Ambassador to Somalia and Zaire, a head of \"counterterrorism\"for Reagan and Bush, and one of the US government officials ensuring that CIAfunds reached the Afghan resistance groups, including that of Osama bin Laden,during the Soviet occupation between 1979 and 1989. Oakley later worked forDelta-Nimir, the joint operation of the bin Mahfouz and Al-Amoudi families, thefunders of Osama bin Laden and associates of the Bushes. Delta-Nimir was apartner of Unocal in the Afghan pipeline project and was already a major investorwith Unocal in the oil fields of Azerbaijan, as I have outlined. At the same time asworking for the Unocal consortium, Oakley and Khalilzad were also advising theUS State Department.\" Another of those hired to \"advise\" and lobby on behalf ofthe Turkmenistan government in the early 1990s was Alexander Haig, the Knightsof Malta initiate and formerly a Reagan-Bush Secretary of State, commander ofNATO forces, and one-time military assistant to Henry Kissinger.Unocal gave the Taliban a fax machine to speed communications and funded ajob training programme through the University of Nebraska in the Talibanstronghold of Kandahar to train people to work on the pipeline. Unocal flewTaliban officials to the United States for talks in early December 1997 and spentseveral days at their headquarters in Sugarland, Texas, enjoying star treatment.Sugarland is part of Houston, the home of the Bush family operations. The visit alsoincluded meetings with the State Department in Washington. There was no talkwhatsoever about Taliban support for terrorism and Osama bin Laden, and no talkof handing him over. Instead Unocal \"offered them a generous cut of the profits\","},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"118\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.according to journalist John Pilger.36Dick Cheney was in Texas at this time as headof Halliburton, which stood to gain enormously from the Unocal-Taliban pipeline.Oops, sorry, Taliban we hate youWhat scuppered the Unocal deal, among other things, was the mounting outrageamong women's groups at the Taliban's unbelievable abuse of women and theirbasic human rights. American women's groups began to organise protests againstUnocal and the Feminist Majority Foundation in Los Angeles petitioned theCalifornia State Government to revoke Unocal's charter in response to theirnegotiations with the Taliban. It became impossible for the Taliban regime to berecognised. Then, in 1998, came the bombings of US Embassies in Kenya andTanzania, which killed 224 people, 12 of them American. Osama bin Laden wasblamed for these outrages and President Clinton ordered the bombing of targets inAfghanistan and Sudan, two countries said to be protecting him. He also froze binLaden's assets (it says here) and banned US firms from doing business with him.The Bush family must have been out of the country at the time and didn't hear thatone. With these developments Unocal's plans were in ruins and they pulled out ofthe pipeline deal on December 4th 1998. John J. Maresca, Unocal's Vice President forInternational Relations, had told the House Committee on International Relationsthat the \"Taliban government in Afghanistan is an obstacle\" to the pipeline projectand that \"construction of the pipeline cannot begin until a recognized governmentis in place in Kabul that has the confidence of governments, lenders, and ourcompany.\" In the wake of September 11th, that isexactlywhat has happened, andthe Afghanistan pipeline is now going to be built! This is all just a co-incidence, ofcourse, and nothing to worry about. As the US Government Energy Informationfact sheet on Afghanistan said in December 2000:\"Afghanistan's significance from an energy standpoint stems from its geographicposition as a potential transit route for oil and natural gas exports from Central Asia tothe Arabian Sea. This potential includes proposed multi-billion dollar oil and gas exportpipelines through Afghanistan, although these plans have now been thrown into seriousquestion ...\"Not, however, for long, it seems, thanks to September 11th and the bombing intooblivion of the Taliban. This invasion was ordered by the Bush administration,including Vice-President Dick Cheney. In May 2002, Mohammad Alim Razim, theMinister for Mines and Industries in the Interim government of \"Unocal's\" HamidKarzai, announced plans to build the pipeline and he said that Unocal was the\"lead company\".37The BBC reported that the pipeline was expected to be built with\"funds from donor countries for the reconstruction of Afghanistan\". Put anotherway, the people that made a fortune from the invasion of Afghanistan through theirarms sales will now have much of the cost of their pipeline met by taxpayers, er,sorry, \"aid to help the poor people of Afghanistan rebuild their country\".38Beforethis announcement, the BBC had reported how \"oil experts\" had dismissed the"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•\"Big Dick\" Cheney\t119suggestion that the \"war on terrorism\" in Afghanistan was in any way about oil. Itis so comforting to know that the academics understand what is happening in theworld and thus can pass on their stunning insights to their students. Paul Stevens,Professor of Petroleum Policy and Economics at Dundee University, said: \"Therewas discussion of the pipeline to carry gas to Pakistan, but it was abandoned waybefore current events because of political, economic and stability problems. So theidea that oil is now driving this war is totally unrealistic. It would be more sensibleto be considering a pipeline on the moon.\"39Which is where, on this evidence,Professor Stevens might choose to relocate. It's made of cheese you know.The drug connection (naturally)Anyone who has done even basic research into the Bush family and their networkof placemen will always look for the drug connection, such is the enormousinvolvement they have with the global drug cartel. So it is with Vice President DickCheney, the long-time Bush crony and beneficiary. Michael C. Ruppert is a formerofficer with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) who also worked for itsOrganized Crime Intelligence Division. He now produces an excellent newslettercalledFrom the Wilderness.\"In his edition of October 24th 2000, headed \"HalliburtonCorporation's Brown & Root is one of the major components of the Bush-Cheneydrug empire\", Ruppert highlights the role played in the Bush-Cheney drug networkby the Halliburton subsidiary Brown & Root. This company is fundamentallyconnected to the US military, the intelligence agencies and their operations aroundthe world, including Bosnia, Kosovo and Macedonia, and employs 20,000 people inmore than 100 countries. The Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) was a CIA-backedoperation and was used, in part, as the excuse for the US and British-controlledNATO to bomb and invade Serbia and Kosovo in support of Illuminati drug and oilpipeline interests. According to theChristian Science MonitorandJane's IntelligenceReview,the Kosovo Liberation Army controls 70% of the heroin entering westernEurope. At the same time Cheney's Brown & Root was making billions with its USgovernment supply and support contracts in the same region, as it still does today.\"It is amazing how the location of Brown & Root operations for the government andthe drug running by government agencies tend to synchronise again and again, andthis was highlighted in a report by the Center for Public Integrity (CPI)\" whichsuggests that drug money was involved in the financial success of Halliburtonunder Dick Cheney's leadership between 1995 and 2000 and, in particular, throughits subsidiary Brown & Root. Then there are those \"loans\" given by US governmentagencies that paid for Brown & Root contracts abroad. Michael Ruppert writes:\"The loans had been granted by the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas PrivateInvestment Corporation. According to [CIA operative] Ralph McGehee's [publication] 'CIABase' both institutions are heavily infiltrated by the CIA and routinely provide NOC [nonofficial cover] to its officers. One of those loans to Russian financial/bankingconglomerate, The Alfa Group of Companies, contained $292 million to pay for Brown andRoot's contract to refurbish a Siberian oil field owned by the Russian Tyumen Oil Company."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"120\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.The Alfa Group completed its 51% acquisition of Tyumen Oil in what was allegedly a riggedbidding process in 1998. An official Russian government report claimed that the AlfaGroup's top executives, oligarchs Mikhail Fridman and Pyotr Aven, 'allegedly participatedin the transit of drugs from Southeast Asia through Russia and into Europe.' These sameexecutives, Fridman and Aven, who reportedly smuggled the heroin in connection withRussia's Solntsevo mob family, were the same ones who applied for the ... [USgovernment] ... loans that Halliburton's lobbying later safely secured. As a result Brownand Root's work in Alfa Tyumen oil fields could continue - and expand.\"After describing how organized criminal interests in the Alfa Group had allegedly stolenthe oil field by fraud, the [Center for Public Integrity] story, using official reports from theFSB (the Russian equivalent of the FBI), oil companies such as BP-Amoco, former CIAand KGB officers and press accounts, then established a solid link to Alfa Tyumen andthe transportation of heroin. In 1995, sacks of heroin disguised as sugar were stolenfrom a rail container leased by Alfa-Echo and sold in the Siberian town of Khabarovsk. Aproblem arose when many residents of the town became 'intoxicated' or 'poisoned'.\"43The Center for Public Integrity (CPI) story also says that the Russian FSB (\"FBI\")report stated that within days of this incident, agents from the Ministry of InternalAffairs raided Alfa-Echo (or Eko) buildings to discover drugs and other\"compromising documentation\", and it was claimed that Alfa Bank has laundereddrug funds from Russian and Colombian drug cartels. The CPI reported that the leadWashington attorney for the Russian Tyumen Oil Company was James C. Langdon,Jr of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer and Feld. This is the same Akin, Gump which, as Ihighlighted earlier, represents the bin Laden financers Khalid bin Mahfouz andMohammed Hussein Al-Amoudi, and the Texas-based Holy Land Foundation forRelief and Development, which had its assets frozen by the US Treasury pending aninvestigation into alleged connections to the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas. BinMahfouz retained the services of Akin, Gump during the \"investigation\" into theBCCU\" The most famous name at Akin, Gump is Vernon Jordan, the associate of BillClinton and friend of Monica Lewinsky, and the firm is awash with cronies of theBush family. The Center for Public Integrity report highlighting the drug connectionto Cheney's Halliburton and Brown and Root also says that the Akin, Gumpattorney James C. Langdon Jr \"helped coordinate a $2.2 million fund raiser for[George W.] Bush ... He then agreed to help recruit 100 lawyers and lobbyists in thecapital to raise $25,000 each for W's campaign.\" What a web.A personal storyMichael Ruppert also tells of his own experience with the government, Brown &Root, and drugs in1977while he was with the Los Angeles Police Department. Hesaid he travelled to New Orleans in June of that year to try to salvage hisrelationship with Nordica Theodora D'Orsay, or \"Teddy\", a CIA contract agent,who had suddenly disappeared. She had wanted him to participate in heroperations from within the Los Angeles Police, but he said: \"I had refused to get"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•\"Big Dick\" Cheney\t121involved with drugs in any way and everything she mentioned seemed to involveeither heroin or cocaine along with guns that she was always moving out of thecountry.\"45The Director of the CIA at this time was ... Father George Bush. Ruppertsaid he knew that Teddy's \"work\" involved the CIA, Los Angeles PoliceDepartment, the royal family of Iran, the Mafia and drugs. Ruppert says he foundTeddy living in an apartment in Greta, New Orleans, equipped with \"scramblerphones, night vision devices and working from sealed communiques delivered bynaval and air force personnel from nearby Belle Chasse Naval Air Station\". Teddy,he writes, was involved in \"something truly ugly\" - arranging for large quantitiesof weapons to be loaded onto ships for Iran and working with associates of NewOrleans Mafia boss Carlos Marcello to coordinate the boat service delivering majorshipments of heroin to the city. The boats arrived at Marcello-controlled docks, hesays, \"unmolested by even the New Orleans police she introduced me to, alongwith divers, military men, former Green Berets and CIA personnel\". He continues:\"The service boats were retrieving the heroin from oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, oil rigsin international waters, oil rigs built and serviced by Brown and Root. The guns thatTeddy monitored, apparently Vietnam era surplus AK 47s and M16s, were being loadedonto ships also owned or leased by Brown and Root. And more than once during theeight days I spent in New Orleans I met and ate at restaurants with Brown and Rootemployees who were boarding those ships and leaving for Iran within days. Once, whileleaving a bar and apparently having asked the wrong question, I was shot at in anattempt to scare me off.\"46Disgusted with what he saw, Ruppert says he returned to California andreported all he had seen, including the Brown & Root connection, to the LosAngeles Police Department. As a result, he says, he was forced to leave the LAPD atthe end of 1978 under threat of death.

Ruppert says he and his attorney wrote to the politicians, theDepartment of Justice, the CIA, and contacted theLos Angeles Times.The FBI and theLos Angeles Police Department claimed he was crazy.

(Fuller became Chief of Staff to Vice PresidentFather George Bush from 1981 to 1985.) Ruppert says he later learned more of thebackground to what he witnessed in New Orleans:\"in 1982, then UCLA [University of California] political science professor Paul Jabberfilled in many of the pieces in my quest to understand what I had seen in New Orleans.He was qualified to do so because he had served as a CIA and State Departmentconsultant to the Carter administration. Paul explained that, after a 1975 treatybetween the Shah of Iran and Saddam Hussein, the Shah had cut off all overt militarysupport for Kurdish rebels fighting Saddam from the north of Iraq. In exchange, theShah had gained access to the Shat al-Arab waterway so that he could multiply his oilexports and income. Not wanting to lose a long-term valuable asset in the Kurds, theCIA had then used Brown and Root, which operated in both countries and maintainedport facilities in the Persian Gulf and near Shat al-Arab, to rearm the Kurds. The wholeoperation had been financed with heroin. Paul was matter-of-fact about it. In 1983 PaulJabber left UCLA to become a Vice President of Banker's Trust and Chairman of theMiddle East Department of the Council on Foreign Relations.\"48What Michael Ruppert says fits with my own full-time research since 1991,which has listed endless examples of what he describes all over the world asIlluminati governments, corporations and organised crime inter-connect. Ruppertsuggests that ...\"the relationships between key institutions, players and the Bushesthemselves suggest that under a George \"W\" administration the Bush family and itsalliesmay well be able, using Brown & Root as the operational interface, to controlthe drug trade all the way from Medellin to Moscow\". Brown & Root, the companyultimately controlled by Vice President Dick Cheney from 1995 to 2000, had nopresence in Colombia apparently until 1997 when it suddenly began to acquirenearly a million square feet of warehouse space. \"Watch that space\" would seem tobe the best advice going on past experience. What do they know about Colombiathat the public do not? One of the most obvious Bush-US Government drugoperations was the already discussed Iran-Contra period in the 1980s in whichOliver North was a major figure. Cathy O'Brien tells inTrance-Formation of Americaof attending drugs parties in which the drug-running North was among theguests.49Cheney was a vehement defender of North's Iran-Contra activities whileserving on the House Intelligence Committee, and supported his election campaignfor a Senate seat in Virginia in 1994. Fortunately North didn't make it.So there you have some of the appalling background to Dick Cheney who, withFather George, is the immediate power behind the throne, or high chair, of PresidentBush. It would not surprise me in the least if Boy George was assassinated in a staged\"terrorist attack\" to dramatically increase the problem-reaction-solution possibilitiesof the \"war on terrorism\". After all, his code-name in the Skull and Bones Society was\"Temporary\" and if Bush were to go, who would be president?

Before I focus specifically on the events ofthat day and their aftermath I will briefly summarise some essential informationabout the other famous names that have sold us the lie about 9/11 and used it tojustify the \"war on terrorism\". Used car, anyone?Colin Powell and Richard ArmitageIput these two together because they are so close to each other and they now headthe US State Department in the \"war against sanity\". George W. Bush namedPowell as his Secretary of State and Powell chose Armitage as his deputy. ColinLuther Powell is seen by most Americans as some kind of \"war hero\", a man youcan trust. In fact, like those around him in the Bush administration, he is a terroristunder any accepted definition of the word. Colin Powell moralising about the needto \"stop terrorism\" is like Bill Clinton delivering a lecture on celibacy. The Bushfamily has sponsored his career and he was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,the military head of U.S forces, when Father George and Dick Cheney launched theGulf War in 1991. It was obvious that when the Bushes, Cheney and Powell gottogether again at the start of 2001, with Boy George as the voice of his father, thatthe United States would find itself in another war. I wrote on my websitedavidicke.comon Bush's inauguration day, January 20th 2001:\"Powell, like the Bushes and Cheney, is bloodline and that's why he is to be the newSecretary of State.

It's just a choice right now between fear and love.It took only months.The rise and rise of Colin PowellFather George appointed Powell as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, USDepartment of Defense, in 1989. At 52, Powell became the youngest head of theJoint Chiefs and the first African-American. In this position he would serve theBush Illuminati agenda in the manufactured \"wars\" not only in Iraq, but also inPanama, Somalia and elsewhere. Many researchers have demolished the Powellmyth and some are detailed in the sources at the end of this chapter.' They haveexposed his long record of breaking international human rights legislation - andworse - in the Iran-Contra scandal, the invasions of Grenada in 1983 and Panama in1989, the Gulf War, and others. His confidants and sponsors say it all, really. Apartfrom Father George, these include Casper Weinberger and Frank C. Carlucci, bothformer Secretaries of Defense; Richard L. Armitage; Vernon E. Jordan, Jr; and DickCheney.2Weinberger was charged over Iran-Contra, but was pardoned by GeorgeBush in the last days of his presidency; Carlucci is a former number two at the CIAand now chairman of the Bush-and Baker-dominated Carlyle Group; Dick Cheneyspeaks for itself; Vernon E. Jordan is the friend of Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinskyand a lawyer with Akin, Gump, et al, which represents the Osama bin Ladenbackers and Bush family business associates, Khalid bin Mahfouz and MohammadHussein al-Amoudi. Jordan is a serious insider with more than 50 honorarydoctorates at U.S universities including Yale and Harvard, and is connected to astream of Illuminati organisations like the Bilderberg Group, the TrilateralCommission, the Council on Foreign Relations, Joint Center for Political Studies,Brookings Institution, Ford Foundation, American Express, Bankers Trust, and DowJones. Powell described Richard Armitage in his book,My American Journey,'as \"mybrother and my bodyguard\". According to aLos Angeles Timesarticle by JohnBroder: \"Some of Powell's advice comes from others through Armitage, thusinsulating Powell from directly consulting people who might then be identified ashis 'advisers'.\" In short, Powell and Armitage are real close.The other drug-running \"Dick\"Interesting, then, that Armitage is another Bush family clone and confidant whoserved under Father George and Ronald Reagan, and has been widely implicated insome deeply unpleasant activities. Armitage has been accused by many sources ofinvolvement in drug running, hit squads, and CIA dirty tricks on behalf of USadministrations (the Illuminati). James 'Bo' Gritz, a former Operations Colonel inthe Green Berets, says he investigated claims that US prisoners of war from Vietnamwere still being held many years after the end of the conflict when they should havelong been released. In his 1991 book,Called To Serve,and an accompanying video,'Gritz named Richard Armitage, Powell's close friend and deputy Secretary of Statein today's \"war on terrorism\", as a major middleman between the US governmentand General Khun Sa, then the leading \"warlord\" operating in the Golden Triangleof the international opium trade. Gritz wrote:"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•The rest of the gang\t127\"If Richard Armitage was, as Khun Sa avowed, a major participant in parallelgovernment drug trafficking, then it explained why our efforts to rescue POWs had beeninexplicably foiled, time after time ... If it was true, Richard Armitage would be the lastman in the world who would desire to see prisoners of war come home alive.\"5Gritz said that Khun Sa told him the United States government had purchasedall of the opium supply for 1989 - some 900 tons. When Gritz returned to Burmafivemonths later, Khun Sa agreed to be interviewed on video and name thenames of the US government agents he worked with, although he said the nameswere old ones and not the current operatives. He said the government official incharge of buying the opium crop was Richard Armitage and that he was workingwith the notorious Mafia boss in Florida, Santos Trafficante. Khun Sa said he waspaid $300,000 a ton for the opium while officials of the US government wereselling it on the streets of America and elsewhere for $1 million a ton. This is amajor way that the Illuminati fund their covert projects without using traceablesources. Gritz approached President Father George Bush to reveal what he haddiscovered, but Bush didn't want to know for a simple reason - he was heavilyinvolved himself. These claims of involvement in drug running and armstrafficking by Armitage have reportedly been supported by staff at the USEmbassy in Bangkok and his appointment was ended by the United StatesAmbassador to Thailand at the time, Morton Abramowitz. Among those whohave exposed the gruesome activities of Armitage is the excellent researcher andwriter, David Guyatt, and you can read his comprehensive article about Bush,Armitage, and the CIA-sponsored cocaine and heroin network in South-East Asiaon his website.6Guyatt writes:\"Behind the scenes, a virtual war was in progress as the department of Justice and theFBI fought to indict Armitage for his narcotics and other criminal activities. AttorneyGeneral Thornburg, a political appointee of President Bush, powerfully resisted thesemeasures. Significantly, however, Armitage was also under scrutiny by FederalInvestigators working for the President's Commission on Organized Crime, with a focuson foreign organized criminal activity in gambling and drug trafficking.\"Meanwhile, yet another investigator who believed Armitage was 'dirty' was frustrated inhis investigations by Frank Carlucci, the Secretary of Defense [now chairman of theCarlyle Group], and other powerful patrons. In 1975 during Armitage's CIA tour inVietnam, Carlucci was number two at the CIA. Because of the numerous high levelobstructions, investigations into Armitage's criminal activities were curtailed, but notbefore some damaging information had been gathered ... Such was the strength of theinformation developed on Armitage that he was forced to abandon his nomination forSecretary of the Army, and, in fact, all other official US government posts.Subsequently, Defense officials stated privately that Armitage would never again bepermitted to darken the doors of the Department of Defense. [Instead he darkens thedoors of Colin Powell's State Department.]"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"128\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.\"Known as 'Mr Phu' (literally meaning 'Mr Rich') amongst the Vietnamese community,Armitage, despite his disgrace, was still able to count on the enormous power of hispolitical patrons and avoided criminal prosecution. Knowing far too much about USgovernment 'dirt' during the previous three decades provided him with an instant 'donot go to jail' card.\"7Armitage withdrew from his nomination by Father George to be Secretary of theArmy in 1989 because he would have faced a confirmation hearing amid reportsthat organisations representing US war veterans were preparing to oppose him inthe light of his activities in South-East Asia. Armitage has also been linked, alongwith characters like Theodore Shackley and Thomas Clines, to Project Phoenix, theCIA mass-murder unit in South-East Asia that I mentioned earlier. Former CIAofficer Ralph McGehee, who has since tried to tell some truth about the agency, saysthat between 1968 and 1972, the Phoenix, or Phuong Hoang, Operation rounded uphundreds of thousands of Vietnamese and them turned over to the Vietnamesepolice for \"questioning\" (brutal torture).' Tens of thousands (at least) weremurdered through Project Phoenix, most of them perfectly innocent civilians. Bylate 1975, Armitage is reported to have been working out of Bangkok and reportssuggest that in the period 1976 to 1979 he was involved with Shackley, Clines andIran-Contra operative Richard Secord, in setting up a number of corporations andsubsidiaries around the world including Lake Resources, Stanford TechnologyTrading Group, Companie de Services Fiduciaria, CSF Investments and UdallResearch Corporation. During this time, Secord was in Iran coordinating the sale ofUS military aircraft and weapons to Middle Eastern countries.'Oil, drugs and the upper reaches of politics constantly go together. AfterArmitage did not become Secretary of the Army, Father Bush made him a personalenvoy holding the rank of Ambassador and under this guise Armitage went to theformer Soviet Union to assist it with its \"economic development\" in 1989. This wasjust as the race for control of the Caspian oil and gas fields was really getting underway after the \"fall\" of Soviet Communism and new drug routes were beingorganised, which include Azerbaijan. Interestingly, Armitage is a member of theUnited States Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce along with ... Dick Cheney. Theyare also both members of the Illuminati \"think tank\", the Aspen Institute, which ismentioned in some of my other books. Armitage is reported to have visited Burmain 1997 on a trip sponsored by the Burma/Myanmar Forum, a group in WashingtonDC that enjoys major sponsorship from Unocal.'° This is the same Richard Armitagewho is now Deputy Secretary of State to his extremely close friend, Colin Powell;the same Armitage who tells the world who is responsible for September 11th andwho should be bombed and murdered in response. Armitage knows theAfghanistan region well. He was an American \"adviser\" during the war betweenthe Afghanistan Mujahadin and the Soviet Union when Osama bin Laden'snetwork was funded and armed into existence by the CIA.

They have become sounding boards for just about anything theother guy wants to discuss. Often they talk, if only briefly, two or three times a day.\"Newsweekreported that Armitage \"may be Powell's closest friend\".Frankie's everywhereThe guy who protected Armitage from prosecution for crimes against humanity inboth South-East Asia and on the streets of the United States was Frank C. CarlucciIII, the former Assistant Director of the CIA during the Jimmy Carter presidencyand both Secretary of Defense and National Security Adviser to Ronald Reagan (i.e.George Bush). He is now chairman of the Carlyle Group. Colin Powell has referredto Carlucci many times as his \"mentor\"!!! This does not surprise me a bit givenCarlucci's background and the desperate company that Powell chooses to keep.Karl Evanzz says in his book,The Judas Factor: The Plot to Kill Malcolm X,12thatCarlucci's appointment as Consul and Second-Secretary of the US Embassy inStanleyville, the Congo, was a cover for a CIA operation that included the plot toassassinate the recently elected President Patrice Lumumba in 1961. Five monthsafter Lumumba was assassinated, Carlucci was arrested, expelled from the Congo,and returned to the US. He was expelled from Tanzania in 1965 after he wasimplicated in the CIA assassination of the Burundi Prime Minister PierreNgendandumwe. Carlucci would later be appointed to major positions, includingSecretary of Defense, by Bush and Reagan because, clearly, he was just the sort ofcharacter they needed for their agenda. This is the man that Colin Powell calls his\"mentor\" while lecturing the world on the outrages and dangers of terrorism!Colin Powell, this is your lifeWith a line-up of characters like these supporting Colin Powell it is clear that he isbloodline and that he would, by definition, have an interesting \"history\". ColinPowell was born in 1937 into a family of Jamaican immigrants and was brought upin the South Bronx area of New York City. He decided to make the Army his careerand was commissioned as a lieutenant in 1958. It was Colin Powell who\"investigated\" the infamous My Lai Massacre. This was when members of the USArmy's Americal Division entered the hamlet of My Lai 4 in South Vietnam onMarch 16th 1968, tortured and murdered hundreds of civilians, and raped countlesswomen and young girls. The horror was reported by Tom Glen, a soldier who toldof his own involvement at My Lai in a letter to General Creighton Abrams, thecommander of US forces in Vietnam, but his claims were dismissed and covered up.Major Colin Powell, the Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations, G-3, atAmerical Division headquarters, was ordered to investigate the claims and \"reportwithin three days with a suggested reply to Glen\", according to an article inTheNew Republic.\"Powell's report decided that Glen's story was not true except,possibly, for \"isolated instances\". He added: \"In direct refutation of this portrayal isthe fact that relations between Americal soldiers and the Vietnamese people areexcellent.\"The New Republicarticle concluded that a proper investigation of the"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"130\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.charges made by Tom Glen may have led to a legitimate inquiry into the My LaiMassacre and into others that \"included a company that had gone along with TomGlen's on March 16th 1968 and committed a separate massacre of ninety people atMy Khe, for which no one was ever punished\". However, Powell did not choose toinvestigate the My Lai massacre and it was only later when a second soldier, RonRidenhour, gave details to a congressman that the army was forced to investigatepublicly and Powell's original \"investigation\" was shown to be a sham and a cover-up of the atrocities against Vietnamese civilians. But Powell, who knows how to fallin a bog and come out clean, even managed to secure a Legion of Merit citationduring the Ridenhour investigation. Clearly from early in his military career, ColinPowell's desire to see justice done and terrorism punished would not appear to behis guiding light.When he returned to the United States, Powell's career began to progress rapidlyunder the Illuminati sponsorship of characters like Weinberger and Carlucci. Heattended George Washington University and thanks to his powerful backers heprogressed through the hierarchy at the Pentagon. He became National SecurityAdviser in 1987 to Reagan-Bush, a post previously held by people like HenryKissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski, who are both extremely significant players inthe Illuminati web (SeeAnd The Truth Shall Set You Free).National Security Adviser,like Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Secretary of State, is a major Illuminatiappointment and Powell has been all three. While he was Senior Military Assistantto Secretary of Defense Weinberger during the Reagan years, he played a major rolein operations like the invasion of Grenada and the US bombing (based on false\"evidence\") of Libya. It was also during this period with Weinberger that Powellwas implicated in the Iran-Contra affair in which Weinberger was fundamentallyinvolved. Weinberger kept details of the illegal transfer of arms to Iran in a personaldiary that he compiled at meetings of the National Security Council. Yet Powellsupported Weinberger in denying the existence of the diary before later having toadmit the claims were true. Powell told the Iran-Contra investigation under oath:\"The Secretary, to my knowledge, did not keep a diary. Whatever notes he kept, I don'tknow how he uses them or what he does with them. He does not have a diary...\"But in a later sworn statement, he said:\"During the period I worked with Secretary Weinberger ... I observed on his desk asmall pad of white paper ... I viewed it as his personal diary ... Knowing SecretaryWeinberger as I did and knowing the routine way he would jot down notes on thesepads ... I considered them a private diary.\"Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence Walsh said Powell's testimony was \"at leastmisleading\", but \"did not warrant prosecution.\" Funnily enough, the Iran-ContraSpecial Counsel's report said virtually the same about Powell's best buddy, RichardArmitage: \"Independent Counsel declined to prosecute Armitage because the OIC's"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•The rest of the gang\t131limited resources were focused on the case against Weinberger and because theevidence against Armitage, while substantial, did not reach the threshold of proofbeyond a reasonable doubt.\" From the National Security Archive comes thisaccount of Powell's involvement:\"Weinberger testified before the [Senate Select] Committee [on Intelligence] that laterthat day he received a call from Poindexter informing him of the President's action [tosend weapons to Iran]. Weinberger ... instructed military aide, Major General ColinPowell, to arrange the transfer of the weapons ... to the CIA, and that the matter was tobe closely held at the direction of the President. General Powell had had previousdiscussions with North about the program and about Israel's problems in gettingreplacement TOW's [missiles] ... According to Armitage and a CIA official, Powellworked with Major General Vincent Russo of the Defense Logistics Agency to providethe material securely and without any loss of funds for the Army.\"14Powell's best buddy Richard Armitage was also involved with Oliver North.According to North's book,Under Fire,15they served together on a secret CIA \"anti-terrorism unit\" that North chaired. Powell, as National Security Adviser to Reagan,threatened to stop all US aid to South American countries that would not supportthe Contra terrorist war in Nicaragua and he would have been further drawn intothe investigative web of Iran-Contra had George Bush not outrageously pardonedPowell's boss, Casper Weinberger and others involved in the scandal in the closingdays of his presidency. Powell would have been very relieved. His career hasincluded leading US forces in George Bush's drug-related invasion of ManuelNoriega's Panama in 1989 after he became Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.Thousands of Panamanian civilians were killed and whole areas of civilian homeswere destroyed. This was covered up by controlling where the media could go,incinerating bodies and dumping corpses in mass graves before they wereidentified, and taking control of all registration by taking over hospitals andmortuaries. Two years later, Powell led US forces in the Gulf War in which at least200,000 Iraqis died, according to a speech at Bohemian Grove shortly after theconflict by John Lehman, Reagan's first Navy Secretary. Under Powell's leadershipin Iraq, civilian areas were targeted, conscripts were buried alive in their trenchesby bulldozers, more than 40 tons of radioactive material was scattered across thedesert by bombs using depleted uranium, oil refineries were set on fire, andthousands of civilians, prisoners and retreating Iraqi soldiers were coldly andsystematically murdered on the infamous \"Highway of Death\". This, and so muchmore, under the leadership of \"war hero\" Colin Powell, the friend of so manydeeply disturbed people, and now the US Secretary of State helping to dictate the\"war on terrorism\". Powell claims he never once received an illegal order duringhis military career (utter claptrap) and yet the actions of his troops in those Iraqimassacres alone should have prompted charges relating to war crimes.

He has served on the boardsof America Online (AOL) and Gulf stream Aerospace, which makes planes forgovernments like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and for Hollywood movies stars. Thecurrent Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, also served on Gulfstream's board andhad stock worth $11 million when US defence contractor, General Dynamics in1999, bought the company. I don't know what Powell made from the deal, but he isreported to have earned $4 million in increased stock value when AOL merged withthat Illuminati front, TimeWarner. His son, Michael K. Powell, was the onlycommissioner at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) who said themerger deal should be allowed to go through without scrutiny. He denied anyconflict of interest with his father's shareholding in AOL at the time, which wasworth some $13 million according to newspaper reports. The FCC calls itself an\"independent\" United States government agency (I love it), which regulates\"interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite andcable\"... [in the] ... \"50 states, the District of Columbia, and US possessions\" .16Infact,Michael K. Powell, a 1999 Henry Crown Fellow of the (Illuminati) AspenInstitute, does not appear to be in favour of much regulation of media corporations,an attitude that suits the gang perfectly.

He was elected to Congress from his home stateof Illinois in 1962 and joined the Richard Nixon administration (controlled byIlluminati Secretary of State Henry Kissinger) in 1969.

These were: member ofthe President's General Advisory Committee on Arms Control - ReaganAdministration (1982 - 1986); Reagan's Special Envoy on the Law of the Sea Treaty(1982 - 1983); senior adviser to Reagan's Panel on Strategic Systems (1983 - 1984);member of the US Joint Advisory Commission on US/Japan Relations - ReaganAdministration (1983 - 1984); President Reagan's Special Envoy to the Middle East(1983 - 1984); member of the National Commission on the Public Service (1987 -1990); member of the National Economic Commission (1988 - 1989); member of theBoard of Visitors of the National Defense University (1988 - 1992); member of theCommission on US/Japan Relations (1989 - 1991); Federal CommunicationsCommission High Definition Television Advisory Committee (1992 - 1993);chairman, Commission on the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States (1998 -1999); member of the US Trade Deficit Review Commission (1999 - 2000); andchairman of the US Commission to Assess National Security Space Managementand Organization (2000).\"How helpful all these government connections proved when as head of G DSearle, he used his Washington insider contacts to ensure that the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) gave the go-ahead to market the infamous artificialsweetener, aspartame. Rumsfeld was to Searle what Cheney was (is) to Halliburton.(Idescribe the manipulation of the FDA decision inChildren Of The Matrix.)Aspartame consists of two synthetic amino acids, phenylalanine (50%) and asparticacid (40 %) bound in methanol (10%). FDA documents released under the Freedomof Information Act in 1995 reveal that the consequences of this horrendoussubstance include blindness and death. Others, according to scientists, are braintumours, brain lesions, headaches, mood swings, skin polyps, insomnia,depression, suppression of intelligence and effects on short-term memory.Investigative author and food specialist Carol Guilford calls aspartame a\"molecular holocaust\".\" This is the mind suppressant (sorry \"sweetener\") for whichDonald Rumsfeld was hired by Searle in 1977 to win government approval. InJanuary 1981, with the Rumsfeld's friends in power under Bush and Reagan, he tolda sales meeting, according to one attendee, that he would \"call in his markers\" andget aspartame approved by the end of the year. Immediately the then commissionerof the Food and Drug Administration had his authority suspended and the job wasgiven to Dr Arthur Hull Hayes, a professor and contract researcher for the DefenseDepartment. His first major decision was to approve the use of aspartame in dryfoods and his last, in 1983, was to approve it for soft drinks. This was despite all theevidence of its consequences and the opposition of his own board of inquiry. Hayesthen left the FDA to become a senior adviser to the public relations firm of ...Rumsfeld's G D Searle. Rumsfeld earned millions for manipulating a truly horriblesubstance into widespread use and he picked up a $12 million bonus when Searlewas bought by the Nazi-connected Monsanto, the promoter of genetically modified(GM) food. Orrin Hatch, the Mormon senator from Utah, also took money fromSearle for pressing their case on aspartame, and he worked to suppress independent"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"134\tThis\"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want.It's just achoice right nowbetweenfear and love.studies into its safety. Hatch was also the man who promoted the BCCI and saidimmediately after 9 / 11 that the authorities believed that Osama bin Laden could beresponsible. The Food and Drug Administration in America, like its equivalent inother countries, is an Illuminati front to block products that are good for humanityand to push through, without proper testing, those that suit the agenda. Thishappened with aspartame thanks to Rumsfeld. First, the FDA approved its use onthe basis of ridiculous data and then had to withdraw that permission in the face ofstudies showing that it caused seizures and brain tumours in animals. But the FDArestored approval in 1981 thanks to Dr Arthur Hull Hayes, despite the unanimousopposition of a Public Board of Inquiry, which had reviewed the scientific data andrecommended a delay. Dr Ralph G. Walton, a Professor of Psychiatry at NorthEastern Ohio University College of Medicine, reviewed all the studies on aspartameand found 166 with relevance for human safety. All of the 74 studies funded by theaspartame industry gave it the all-clear, but 92% of those independently fundedrevealed safety problems. Which ones would you believe?The reason this poison was approved against all the evidence is simplecorruption. A commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, an actingcommissioner, six other operatives, and two attorneys assigned to prosecuteNutraSweet for submitting fraudulent tests, left the organisation to work for ...NutraSweet, a trade name for aspartame. One genuine scientist working for the FDAwrote to a US senator: \"It's like a script for Abbott and Costello. It works like this:'approve our poison, and when you stop being a bureaucrat we'll make you aplutocrat! After it's licensed we'll pay off the American Dietetics, the AmericanDiabetes Association, the American Medical Association and anyone we need who'sfor sale'.\" The man orchestrating all this was Donald Rumsfeld, now US \"Defense\"Secretary in the \"war on terrorism\". Clearly a man you can trust. By the way, theMonsanto Corporation of St Louis, Missouri, expanded the accredited uses foraspartame after taking over Rumsfeld's G D Searle in 1985. Monsanto is anIlluminati company to its fingertips and the promoter of genetically modified food,another part of the Illuminati assault on the human mind and body. It is using thesame methods to win approval for genetically modified food as it did for aspartame.The current Bush administration is awash with people connected to Monsanto.A few other \"characters\"John Ashcroft, George W. Bush's Attorney General, is one of the Monsanto fundedinsiders in Boy George's US government. Ashcroft is another with his snout in thecorporate trough with Microsoft and Enron among his benefactors. When the Enronscandal broke, with President Bush's biggest funder collapsing amid documentshredding and fantastic corruption, we had the farcical situation in which AttorneyGeneral Ashcroft could not take part in the subsequent investigation because hehad taken money from them! In the November 2000 election for the Senate,Ashcroft failed even to beat a dead man. His opponent, the Missouri Governor MelCarnahan, died in a plane crash with his son and campaign adviser while flying in aCessna to a campaign rally. Carnahan's name stayed on the ballot paper and more"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre DisasterThe rest of the gang\t135people voted for him than Ashcroft. It was the first time anyone had posthumouslywon election to the Senate. He couldn't do any worse than the live ones, that's forsure. Ashcroft was soon back in Washington, however, when the incomingPresident Bush named him as US Attorney General. This is the man who has beendismantling basic human freedoms in the United States since September 11th withan enthusiasm and glee that can only be described as orgasmic. He was appointedby Boy George to replace the deeply corrupt Janet Reno, she of Waco mass murderfame. Attorney General is another big Illuminati-nominated post. Ashcroft is amember of the \"Religious Right\" that has spawned Bush family clones like themonumental hypocrite Pat Robertson (seeChildren Of The Matrix)who has used his\"ministry\" and massive public donations to his \"humanitarian projects\" to expandhis business empire in places like the Congo when it was ruled by his friend, thevicious and corrupt dictator, Mobuto Sese-Seko. Show me a member of the\"Religious Right\" and I'll show you a hypocrite, or, at least, it has never failed yet.Anyway, this is the \"spiritual\" home of John Ashcroft, the freedom-destroyingAttorney General, who has seized on the deaths of thousands in New York andWashington to cast aside basic human freedoms.Ashcroft describes himself as a Christian conservative who doesn't smoke, drinkor dance. He is against abortion because it takes a human life created by God, andyet supports the death penalty and the murder of men, women, and children, intheir thousands every month in Iraq, and mass murder in many other parts of theworld like Afghanistan. Ashcroft's claim to fame before he became an officialfreedom-buster for the Bush administration was his \"war on drugs\" and addictivesubstances (like the many Father George Bush headed while running drugs himself).Ashcroft demands the death penalty for such offences. Bad news, eh, Georgie? At thesame time Ashcroft has taken $44,500 from liquor companies since 1993, including$20,000 from the St Louis-based Anheuser-Busch. He has also been lauded by thebooze industry in a video tribute produced by the Beer Institute of America. WhenMother Jonesmagazine questioned this contradiction, Ashcroft said: \"It is a productthat it is in demand [yes, like drugs] and when it's used responsibly it's like otherproducts.\" Ashcroft also accepted money from the tobacco industry for his 1994Senate race and said of tobacco that people should be free to make bad choices.Unless Ashcroft decides otherwise, that is. Here you have another hypocrite with aselective morality that changes by the sentence to meet the needs of the moment.This is the guy, people of America, who is taking your freedom away.The \"anti-terrorism\" terroristJohn Negroponte is President Bush's Ambassador to the United Nations, clearly avital role in the \"war on terrorism\". Negroponte knows all about the subject from hisdays as US ambassador to Honduras between 1981 and 1985 where he helped tocoordinate America's covert war against the Sandinista government in Nicaragua.During his spell in Honduras, US aid to that country soared from $3.9 million in 1980to $77.4 million in 1984. This funded so many US bases and so much weaponry thatthe country became known asUSSHonduras.A four-part series in theBaltimore Sun"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"136\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want.

Murdering teachers and slitting thethroats of midwives were a speciality.\"19I can see why Bush chose him, then.Wendy \"pathet lao\" ChamberlainThe US Ambassador to Pakistan who has played a pivotal role in the vitalrelationship between Pakistan and the United States since September 11th is WendyChamberlain, who is described innocently in an official profile I read as a \"motherof two\". The lady is rather more than that, as you would expect as an appointee ofGeorge W. Bush, or, more accurately, of those who control him. (Forgive me if I findit hard to believe that Boy George is making the foreign policy decisions when,during his election campaign, he thought Nigeria was a continent, failed to namethe presidents of Chechnya, Pakistan and India, confused Slovakia and Slovenia,and asserted that Greeks were called 'Grecians' and East Timorese were EastTimorians.)20Before Bush sent Wendy Chamberlain to Pakistan in the weeks before9/11, she was Deputy Assistant Secretary at the International Narcotics and LawBureau of the State Department. But she is best known for her period as USAmbassador to Laos while that country was controlled by the terrorists of thePathet Lao regime. She got along with these terrorist dictators extremely well, itwould appear. Philip Smith, director of the Lao Veterans of America, led theopposition to Chamberlain's appointment to Pakistan from the 350,000-strong Laoand Hmong exile community in the United States. \"The freedom-loving people inPakistan, Afghanistan and South Asia need to be informed and aware that WendyChamberlain has a deplorable track record of utter and total appeasement,\" he said.\"She has never met a military general or dictatorship that she did not like.\" A lettercirculated on the Internet by the Lao Veterans, dated June 29th 2001, urgedconfirmation hearings to block Chamberlain's appointment to Pakistan andrevealed some of the \"highlights\" of her period in Laos:\"The Laotian and Hmong-American community is overwhelmingly opposed to theconfirmation of Wendy Chamberlain as Ambassador to Pakistan given her deplorabletrack-record of total appeasement in Laos (see news report from Washington, DC, inAgence France Press, June 26th 2001).

We, therefore, ask that you putan immediate \"hold\" on her confirmation on the Senate floor to send a powerfulmessage that State Department officials involved in countenancing crimes againsthumanity and gross human rights violations against the relatives of Lao and Hmong-Americans will not be rewarded with promotions - especially a promotion to such animportant position. Moreover, by putting a \"hold\" on Chamberlain on the Senate Floor, itwill send an important message that a new policy toward Laos is needed-not the weakand pandering policy of appeasement that Chamberlain so vigorously promoted and thatcost so many innocent people their lives.\"Clearly, Ambassador Chamberlain has never met a military general or dictatorship thatshe did not like - and did not work to appease. She is utterly unfit for a seniorAmbassadorship in Pakistan, a country of immense importance to US national securityinterests, compared to the tiny, third-world nation of Laos, which she, somehow, totallybungled at the cost of many lives. It should be noted that Ms Chamberlain serveddisgracefully as US Ambassador to Laos where she \"went native\" (dressing in nativecostumes at late-night parties with Pathet Lao communist generals where shefrequently drank excessively and submissively catered to every whim of the militaryjunta at the expense of the United States and its citizens). Indeed, Chamberlain workedovertime to appease the military generals in Laos - while the relatives of Lao andHmong-Americans died at the cruel hands of the regime. She also countenanced themassacre of thousands of Hmong and Lao civilians and opposition leaders in Laosduring her deplorable tenure. Moreover, she did nothing to gain access or intervene toreopen Xeng Khouang (Xieng Khouang), Sysamboun \"Special Zone,\" and other often-closed areas of Laos - including the Lao gulag system in Sam Neua and elsewhere -where military crackdowns and ethnic cleansing operations occurred against thousandsof Hmong and Lao people.\"21She sounds like a perfect Bush appointment. In fact, Chamberlain's behaviour inLaos was so disgraceful that the US House of Representatives took theunprecedented step of introducing legislation in response.\" House Resolution 332cites Chamberlain's behaviour and methods that included the collaboration withcommunist Pathet Lao officials (terrorists) over the disappearance of two Hmong-Americans. This was the lady appointed by Bush to the key post of Ambassador toPakistan months before 9 / 11 and the \"war on terrorism\" in which Pakistan wouldbe of major importance. Bush, or rather his masters, also appointed Christina Roccaas US Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia weeks before 9/11. Her bureau isresponsible for US foreign policy and relations with Afghanistan, Bangladesh,Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Rocca is a career officerof the CIA going back through the Father Bush and Reagan years at least to 1982.She, like Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, was involved in CIAoperations relating to the war between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union whenOsama bin Laden's terrorist network was funded and armed into being by the CIA.Rocca has shown a keen interest in Afghanistan and Pakistan affairs for many years."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"138\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want.

This is the grandson of William StampsFarish, the president of the Rockefellers' Standard Oil, New Jersey, (now Exxon),when they were supplying Hitler and the Nazis with fuel during the Second WorldWar. A letter written by Standard Oil Vice President Frank A. Howard, to William S.Farish was released by the US Justice Department at the time. Remember that I.G.Farben was at the very core of the Nazi war machine and ran concentration campslike the one at Auschwitz. The letter to Farish said:\"...In England I met by appointment the Royal Dutch [Shell Oil] gentlemen from Hollandand ... a general agreement was reached on the necessary changes in our relationswith the I.G. [Farben], in view of the state of war ... the Royal Dutch Shell Group isessentially British ...I also had several meetings with the [British] air ministry ...\"I required the help to obtain the necessary permission to go to Holland ... Afterdiscussions with the [American] Ambassador [Joseph Kennedy, JFK's father] ... thesituation was cleared completely ... The gentlemen of the Air Ministry ... very kindlyoffered to assist me in re-entering England.\"Pursuant to these arrangements, I was able to keep my appointment in Holland (havingbeen flown there on a British Air Force bomber), where I had three days of discussionwith the representatives of I.G. They delivered to me assignments of some 2,000 foreignpatents and ... we did our best to work out complete plans for a modus vivendi whichcould operate through the term of the war, whether or not the US came in.\"William S. Farish refuelled Nazi shipping and submarines in Spain and LatinAmerica during the war and it was the Standard Oil/I.G. Farben enterprise thatopened the Auschwitz Camp on June 14th 1940, and used the slave labour of Jews,political opponents, gypsies, and others to produce artificial rubber and gasolinefrom coal. Farish was very close to Hermann Schmitz, the chairman of I.G. Farben.Standard Oil hired the Illuminati publicist Ivy Lee to promote I.G. Farben and theNazis in the United States (seeAnd The Truth Shall Set You Freefor the detailedbackground). In this same period, Prescott Bush, President Bush's grandfather, washelping to fund the Nazis and so you would expect the Bushes and the Farishfamily to be close. Farish's grandson, William S. Farish III, became a very closefriend and associate of Father George and a bosom buddy of the Queen of England.She has visited his Lane's End ranch in Kentucky many times, taking her horses tobreed with Farish's prize stallions.

Blair, who should by law be an accountable Prime Ministerrunning the country in cooperation with his cabinet, has become \"President Blair\",running his own agenda in league with unelected \"advisers\". Mo Mowlam wasBlair's former Secretary for Northern Ireland and she was the only member of hissycophantic, spineless, bunch of shady main-chancers (his \"cabinet\") that I wouldtrust to tell me the time. After she left the government, she told the BBCdocumentary, Cabinet Confidential: \"Tony's acting more like a president than a primeminister and in that situation the cabinet itself is dead\". Mowlam suggested that theunelected advisers have more power than the cabinet in relation to the primeminister. \"They seemed to be operating instead of the cabinet,\" she said, and shecontinued:\"He makes decisions with a small coterie of people, advisers, just like the president ofthe United States. He doesn't go back to cabinet, he isn't inclusive in terms of othercabinet ministers and if he really wants to get the support of the public and the supportof Parliament there has to be more people included.\" 24As in Nazi Germany, you are not allowed to speak out against Herr Blair.Freedom of speech and having a right to an opinion is only accepted if Blair agreeswith what you say. The difference is that in Nazi Germany they assassinated you forchallenging the Fuhrer and in Blair's Britain they assassinate your character.Mowlam was \"Our Mo\" when she was in the Blair cabinet and \"Mad Mo\" whenshe started challenging high command. One of Blair's \"BIGs\" - Buffoons inGovernment - who has dismissed her in such terms is the punch-throwing and inmy view oaf of a Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott. Along with ForeignSecretary Jack \"straw man\" Straw, Prescott is perhaps the number one \"BIG\" in theBlair cabinet from where I'm sitting. Blair, in truth, has become a dictatormasquerading as a democratic prime minister and since September 11th he hasbeen a law unto himself. The BBC documentary showed how Blair's \"war cabinet\"included his unelected director of communications and strategy, Alistair Campbell,and the newly appointed head of government relations, Sally Morgan. Campbell, aformer tabloid journalist, is paid by a Civil Service that is supposed to be politicallyimpartial and yet he is a Labour supporter whose role in the Blair circle is to spinnews and events to present his \"boss\" in the best light and to get the people to seethe world in a way that suits Blair's agenda. None of this is a surprise to mebecause to my eyes Blair has always had a large notice on his forehead warning:\"Not to be trusted\". I felt this long before he became Prime Minister. I have said in"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"140\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.previous books and talks that he was an Illuminati place man put in power to servethe cause, which included taking the UK into the European single currency,dropping the pound sterling, and absorbing British independence into theEuropean fascist superstate. I wrote that years ago and that is precisely what he isdoing, helped by the pathetic Liberal Democrats of Charles Kennedy. Anyone whosupports the Euro single currency is supporting their own financial imprisonmentby unelected bankers working to the Illuminati agenda for global control.The chosen oneTony Charles Lynton Blair was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on May 6th 1953. Hisfather, Leo, was a law lecturer at Edinburgh University, a major educational centrefor the Illuminati. Blair grew up in the industrial city of Durham, which is mostfamous for its cathedral, and also lived in Australia for three years. He waseducated at the Durham Choristers School before returning to Edinburgh to attendthe prestigious (if you like that sort of thing) Fettes College. Blair went on to OxfordUniversity and then took a legal apprenticeship at the chambers of AlexanderIrvine, a Queens Counsel and influential in the Labour Party. Blair became abarrister specialising in industrial and employment law, and met his lawyer wife,Cherie, during his apprenticeship. They married in 1980 and have four children,Euan, Nicky, Kathryn and Leo (who, on May 20th 2000, became the first child to beborn to a sitting prime minister in 152 years). Blair's brother, William James LyntonBlair QC, also went into law from this \"ordinary family\" and has been a consultantwith the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. In 1983, Blair waselected to Parliament as the Labour MP for Sedgefield, near Durham in the north-east of England, and began a rapid rise the top. He was given a number of jobs inthe Labour shadow cabinet during the long years of Labour opposition to MargaretThatcher's Conservative government and her successor, John Major, who is nowEuropean representative of the Carlyle Group.At some point in the Blair story he clearly became the chosen one for somepowerful forces and within 24 hours of the sudden death of the then Labour Partyleader John Smith from a heart attack, the whole of the British media had alreadydecided that Blair was his successor. I still think there is more to know aboutSmith's death. The wave of support for Blair within a Labour Party that had beenout of government for so long was fuelled by the media message that here was theonly person who could lead them back to Downing Street. Blair was elected leaderof the party in July 1994, a year after he had been invited to attend his first meetingof the Illuminati's secretive Bilderberg Group in a hotel at Vouliagment, Greece.Blair took control of the Labour Party at every level and has transformed it into afiercely centralised dictatorship, a personalised, customised vehicle for his (theIlluminati's) agenda. It has become a vacuum of principle in which Blair's word islaw. And Blair is controlled by the shadowy figures that decide what his word willbe.With the media propaganda machine behind him, Blair, at 44, became theyoungest British Prime Minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812 when he was electedby a landslide on May 1st 1997. Months earlier I had said in public talks that not"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•The rest of the gang\t141only would Blair be the next UK prime minister, but that he would be elected onMay Ist - an extremely important date in the Illuminati ritual calendar (seeTheBiggest Secret).In the UK it is the sitting prime minister who decides the date of thegeneral election. In this case that was John \"Carlyle Group\" Major, the Conservativeleader.Major chose May 1st.Dancing for RupertOne of Blair's most significant supporters is the major Illuminati media tycoonRupert Murdoch. His News Corporation has some 800 subsidiaries and owns theUKTimes, Sunday Times,and the downmarket tabloids theSunandNews of the World.His holdings also include Sky Global Networks, which owns the satellite televisioncompany BSkyB. Murdoch controls Twentieth Century Fox, the Fox TV network,New York Post,and close to 200 newspapers worldwide, to name only some of hisholdings. Murdoch had always thrown his UK newspapers behind the Conservativecandidate in UK elections, but when Blair became Labour leader, all that suddenlychanged. Blair was now his man. This has been incredibly beneficial for Blair and italso ensures access on demand to the UK Prime Minster for Murdoch. It was allegedthat after the 1997 election win Blair rang the Bilderberger Italian Prime MinisterRomano Prodi to help Murdoch to expand his empire in Italy by buying into theMediaset empire. This was owned by another Illuminati media and political frontman, the convicted crook Silvio Berlusconi, who became, staggeringly, Italian PrimeMinister. Murdoch's daughter, Elisabeth, a News Corporation executive, is a closefriend of Blair's long-time spinner Peter Mandelson.One major example of this Blair-Murdoch relationship came in May 2002 whenBlair's government announced plans to change the rules on media ownership toallow Murdoch to expand his holdings in Britain against all the principles of mediadiversity. A year earlier Murdoch visited Blair at Downing Street to \"discuss hisconcerns over Britain's cross-ownership laws\".2'These \"concerns\" were related torules that prevented him from owning a terrestrial television station because hisnewspapers have a 33% share of the UK market and he also owns the satellite TVnetwork BSkyB. But with all of his newspapers supporting Blair during electioncampaigns, Murdoch has no problem telling the Prime Minister what to do, and theeasing of media regulations means that Murdoch can now buy the terrestrial stationChannel 5 if he wishes. Blair also opened the way for corporations outside ofEurope to own British television companies. The major ITV network, once ownedby many companies in the various regions of the country, will be allowed to becomeone centrally owned operation. The rules will now permit this network to bebought by Illuminati corporations like Disney and AOL/TimeWarner and it alsoallows the ITV network and Channel 5 to be owned by the same people. Channel 5is currently controlled by the Illuminati media giant Bertelsmann, which is reportedto have ambitions to dominate the UK commercial television market.

It's just a choice right now between fear and love.radio station, and newspaper groups can buy radio stations. The rules preventingone radio group owning more than 15% of the market are scrapped. All thesechanges by Blair are precisely in line with the Illuminati agenda for centralisation ofmedia power. Like I say, Blair is a 100%, wholly owned subsidiary of the Illuminati.We are full of sleaze if you please ...From the moment Blair walked into Downing Street he has slavishly pursued theIlluminati agenda, pressing for further centralisation of the European Union andconceding more and more power to the Brussels bureaucrats over British law andsociety. He has all along been preparing to replace the pound sterling with the euroas I said in my books back in the 1990s and he has backed every Illuminati militaryintervention by deploying British forces and supporting the American governmentat every turn in the former Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and the \"war on terrorism\" ingeneral. He has also showered government jobs and patronage on his friends,supporters and associates in the same way the Bushes do in America. \"Tony'sCronies\" has become a common phrase in British political life. Also like the Bushes,he enjoys massive support from the top business leaders and corporations as thegap between rich and poor (which the Labour Party was formed 100 years ago toclose) gets wider and wider under Herr Blair. On May 14th 2001, before Blair wonhis second term, 58 business leaders wrote a letter to Rupert Murdoch'sTimesnewspaper urging business to support a Blair victory. They were chairmen or chiefexecutives and a number had been knighted or given other \"honours\" by Blair, whohas turned the United Kingdom political scene into a mirror of that headquarters ofpolitical slush and sleaze, the United States. Indeed Blair insists that he andPresident Bush think alike.21Blair's Downing Street \"Chief of Staff\" Jonathan Powell is supposed to be animpartial civil servant who is paid by the taxpayer. Yet he once worked for theLabour Party raising money through \"donations\" from business. Clearly he's stillworking for the Labour Party, it's just that they aren't paying for him - the peopleare. The deeply corrupt Enron Corporation donated money to Blair's Labour Partyand saw changes unfold in government energy policy that suited their agenda. Blairsays the two were not connected. Then there was the bizarre story of LakshmiMittal, the Indian steel tycoon and one of the richest men in Britain. At the end ofMay 2001, Mr Mittal gave 125,000 to the Labour Party shortly before the generalelection in which Blair won his second term. After his victory Blair sent a letter tothe Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase supporting the takeover of Sidex, itsnationalised steel company, by Mr Mittal's firm, LNM. Days later Romania awardedthe 300 million sale to Mr Mittal in the face of French competition. Mr Blair said hesent the letter because he was supporting a \"British company\" and not because ofthe very large cheque Mr Mittal had given his party. This is a lie. Mittal's LNM is amulti-national corporation registered in the Caribbean tax haven of the DutchAntilles and of the 125,000 people it employees worldwide, fewer than 100 live inthe UK!27Not only that, but Mr Mittal's empire is in direct competition with Britishfirms that do employ British people. When the story broke, the lies poured out of"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Alice inWonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•The rest of the gang\t143Downing Street as always. They said that Mittal's donation was made after thegeneral election (lie); they said his company was British (lie); that Blair had onlysigned the letter drafted by the Foreign Office as a matter of routine (lie - the letterwas amended and rewritten by Blair's office); they said it was only a letter ofcongratulation and did not affect the deal (lie - the British Embassy in Bucharestsaid it was an important factor in clinching the contract). Mittal's wife also gave5,000 to the constituency fund of Keith Vaz, Blair's former Minister for Europe,who faced a major Parliamentary investigation into his financial activities andbehaviour that led to him being suspended from Parliament for a month. I cannotstress it enough - these are the people telling you what happened on September11th and who was responsible! A website called Red Star Research keeps tabs on theHerr Blair Bunch of special advisers and business leaders that influencegovernment policy and pay the Labour Party bills.\"The cynical nature of Blair and his government was highlighted in May2002in aPanoramadocumentary on BBC television. This revealed how Blair had spent recordsums of taxpayers' money on \"government information\" advertisements in theweeks before the general election that gave him a second term. In the12monthsbefore the election the government was the UK's biggest buyer of advertising with arecord£192million being spent - up70%on the previous year - and almost half ofthat money was used between January and March2001in the run-up to the election.A record£49million was spent in the March alone. Government advertising ispurchased through a government department called COI Communications, which issupposed to be independent of party politics. The advertising itself is supposed to beused to inform the public about changes in the law and policy. Instead, asPanoramaclearly demonstrated, Blair used this taxpayers' money to promote his governmentin an effort to increase his support at the coming election. What cynical corruption ofthe system, what contempt for the people he claims to represent. Tony Blair, againlike Bush, is one of the most blatantly and transparently insincere politicians I haveever seen in a profession that is largely insincere by reflex action. His \"off the cuff\"remarks are carefully rehearsed and worded - as with his \"spontaneous\" tribute toPrincess Diana on the day she was murdered in Paris in1997(seeThe Biggest Secret).It turned out he had been rehearsing the \"spontaneity\" all morning with his spinnerAlistair Campbell. You can always tell when Blair has been rehearsing an\"emotional, heartfelt, statesmanlike\" and \"spontaneous\" response because he keepspausing between words and looking down in the contrived manner of some C-movie actor. Blair also strenuously denied that Diana's death was anything morethan an accident, and resisted an independent investigation.Tony two-tonguesJournalist John Pilger highlighted a classic example of Blair double-speak when hewrote of ... \"the grotesque hypocrisy of Tony Blair weeping for the children ofDunblane, then sending machine guns that mow down children in East Timor...\"29With Blair and his ministers and officials working as the sales and marketing team,Britain is the second biggest exporter of arms in the world (second to guess who?)"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"144\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want.

Theseweapons are used by terrorists of all kinds in the Middle East and across theworld.' In 1975, Britain sold arms abroad worth $470 million. By 1995 it was 4.7billion .31Ironically, but appropriately in the circumstances, on the morning ofSeptember 11th 2001 as those planes were hijacked, a protest was under way in theDocklands area of London against the biggest \"arms fair\" - death and terror marketplace - yet held in Britain. While Tony Blair was in front of the cameras condemningterrorism, British arms manufacturers were down the road in Docklands seeking tosell weapons for terrorism with the full support of Tony Blair. Nothing captures thecold, calculating, heartless approach of the Blair government better than the case ofJo Moore, the Blair crony and adviser to the former Transport Secretary StephenByers.Within an hour of the second plane crashing into the World Trade Center,and while the rest of the world looked on in stunned horror, Jo Moore was sendingan e-mail to Blair government colleagues saying that the disaster had provided agood opportunity that day to \"bury\" controversial stories they did not want to bepublicised. Blair and Byers both had a very public opportunity to stand for commondecency in their government by sacking Ms Moore. They refused to do so despitethe public outrage that followed, and it was only much later after another stormbroke in her department that she was told to go. I'll take no lectures on moralityfrom Tony Blair, thank you very much.What a fantastic cesspit of sleaze, corruption, mass murder, drug running andterrorism we have had to wade through in these last five chapters. And pinchyourself: these are the same honest, fair, just, peace-loving, big-hearted, thoroughlytrustworthy characters that have told us what happened on September 11th, whowas responsible, and what should happen as a consequence.

I guess if the technique keepsworking, why change it? In my other books you will find many of these recountedin detail, but here are some of the problem-reaction-solutions of enormousrelevance to the events of September 11th. For those who are new to thisinformation the parallels will be startling.The Oklahoma bombThere was a \"rehearsal\" for what happened on September 11th. It came some sixyears earlier on April 19th 1995 when a massive bomb, or bombs in truth, destroyedthe Alfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City and 168 people, many of themchildren at a day care centre, were killed. All the classic features were there: theproblem of a \"terrorist attack\" on a US federal building; the villain or \"patsy\"named immediately as Timothy McVeigh; the reaction of understandable outragefrom the people as they saw the devastation and believed the government's versionof events; and the solution, with a series of measures that removed civil libertiesand targeted the so-called Christian Patriot or militia movement that had beenhaving considerable success exposing the global conspiracy in the years before. Itwas claimed that McVeigh was connected to the militia underground and hisalleged accomplice, Terry Nichols, was also portrayed as some white supremacistand racist even though his two marriages had been to a Mexican and a Filipino.McVeigh was executed and Nichols is currently serving a life sentence. \"Anti-terrorism\" bills were rushed through Congress in days and at least some had clearlybeen written and printed before the bombing. They included all the elements ofdestroying civil liberties that have been still further extended as a result of 9/11.Within 24 hours of the carnage, President Bill Clinton was calling for \" ...an easingof restrictions on the military's involvement in domestic law enforcement\". Onceagain this was achieved to an even greater extent after September 11th.147"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"148\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.Clinton also used the bombing to urge the media to ban \"anti-governmentextremists\" from their papers, screens and microphones, and he attacked thealternative talk radio shows that are designed to give the public a rare opportunityto hear and communicate information that differs from the official line. Thebombing was said to have been a response by McVeigh to the murder of men,women and children by the United States government at Waco, Texas, on April 19th1993. One of the government agencies blamed for Waco was the Bureau of AlcoholTobacco and Firearms (ATF), which had offices in the Murrah Building and theofficial story says that they were the target. In \"response\" to the bombing, one bill'proposed by the Democrat Charles Schumer, now the Senator for New York State,included five-year prison sentences for publicly engaging in \"unseemlyspeculation\" and publishing or transmitting by wire or electronic means \"baselessconspiracy theories regarding the Federal government of the United States\".Naturally, the government would decide if it was \"baseless\". Schumer had alsovehemently dismissed evidence of the mass murder in Waco in a way that beggaredbelief.His fascist bill never became law, but you watch them try again wheneverthey think they can succeed. Already the FBI \"Joint Anti-Terrorism Task Force\" hasissued flyers urging the public to call with information about possible \"terrorists\"within the United States. The flyers say that among the people to watch for are\"'defenders' of the US Constitution against the federal government and UN\";people who make \"numerous references to the Constitution\"; those who \"attemptto police the police\"; and \"Lone individuals\"?Oklahoma fantasyThere is another tell-tale sign with these set-ups and stings, be it Oklahoma, theKennedy assassination or September 11th. The official story is so full of untruthsand glaring contradictions that anyone with half a brain could take it apart. The USgovernment claimed that a fertiliser and fuel oil bomb left by McVeigh in a Rydertruck destroyed the Murrah Building. He was executed by lethal injection on June11th 2001 and became the first federal execution for 38 years. Actually, I say he wasexecuted; there are those who question even that. Susan Carlson, a reporter forWLS-AM Radio in Chicago, witnessed the \"execution\" at Terre Haute, Indiana, andsays that McVeigh \"... appeared to be still breathing or what appeared to be shallowbreathing, even after being pronounced dead and his eyes remained open\".3McVeigh had said he was micro-chipped while serving in the US forces and tounderstand, perhaps, why he would not vigorously defend himself when he couldnot possibly have been responsible for that scale of death and devastation wewould need to know what was going on and being said or threatened behind thescenes. Significantly when McVeigh was first arrested he was given a \"mentalassessment\" by Louis Jolyon West from the University of California. What thenewspaper reports of this did not say is that West is one of the most notorious CIAmind controllers in America, as my books and many others have revealed (seeAndThe Truth Shall Set You FreeandThe Biggest Secret).Another interesting coincidence isthat two years before the Oklahoma bomb, Martin Keating, the brother of"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre DisasterPlay it again, scam\t149Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating, wrote a book calledThe Final Jihad.This was anovel about a terrorist attack on the \"Oklahoma City Building\" by a man calledThomas McVeigh. Keating dedicated the book to the \"Knights of the Secret Circle\".The provable lieThe FBI said the Murrah Building was destroyed by a single ammonium nitratetruck bomb in a 20-foot Ryder rental truck parked outside by McVeigh. Theproblem is that this is provably impossible. You have only got to look at the smallcrater left where the truck was standing to see that the explosive power could neverhave brought down the Murrah Building and there are other little details like thefact that while some pillars closer to the truck bomb did not fall, others furtheraway did. Retired Brigadier General Benton K. Partin said from the start that thefuel-fertiliser device in the Ryder truck could not possibly have brought down theMurrah Building. Too many facts, he said, simply didn't add up. Partin is no anti-government \"extremist\", although that was the way he was portrayed in order todiscredit his devastating information. He was chairman of the Republican Party inFairfax County, Virginia, for four years and among a long list of US Air Forceappointments he was Commander of the Armament Laboratory, the top researchand development facility at Elgin Air Force Base in Florida. During his 31 years ofactive duty he became a highly acclaimed expert in weapons systems andexplosives, and his Air Force and civilian career record is extremely long andimpressive. Partin's detailed assessment of the bombing has been widely quoted inthe alternative media, but virtually ignored in the mainstream even though itdestroys the official story. Actually, make thatbecauseit destroys the official story.Partin's report, dated July 30th 1995, says that the serious damage and demolitionto supporting columns inside the building could only have been caused by devicesattached to, or placed within, the columns. It was simply not possible for that to beachieved by an explosion from outside the building. Yes, the truck bomb could haveshattered windows and scattered considerable debris, but the laws of physics meanthat it could not bring down concrete pillars that distance away. Partin pointed outthat \" ...most people fail to appreciate how inefficient a blast is in air and howdramatically its destructive potential drops off just a few feet from the explosion\".'The main columns in the Murrah Building were made to survive pressure of morethan 3,000 pounds per square inch. There is no way, as Partin's report points out, fora fuel-fertiliser bomb that far from the building to generate more than a fraction ofthat pressure. However, Partin says that the fantastic damage to the MurrahBuilding could have been caused by a total of just 150 pounds of explosive if it waslocated in the right places on the right support columns.5Dr Rodger Raubach, aPhD in physical chemistry and member of the research faculty at StanfordUniversity, said: \"General Partin's assessment is absolutely correct. I don't care ifthey pulled up a semi-trailer truck with 20 tons of ammonium nitrate; it wouldn'tdo the damage we saw there.\"' Faced with these facts about the impossibility of atruck bomb causing the damage, the \"McVeigh bomb\" began to miraculouslyincrease in size. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and other"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"150\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.government agencies originally said the bomb contained 1,200 pounds ofammonium nitrate and fuel oil (ANFO). But, as if by magic, it was to become 4,000pounds and eventually 4,800. I even heard 7,000 pounds quoted in the mediaaround the time of McVeigh's execution in 2001. But a study by the US Air Forceconfirmed that even at 4,800 pounds, the story does not make sense:\"It is impossible to ascribe the damage that occurred on April 19th, 1995, to a singletruck bomb containing 4,800 pounds ... In fact, the maximum predicted damage of thefloor panels of the Murrah federal building is equal to approximately 1% of the total floorarea of the building.\"Itmust be concluded that the damage at the Murrah federal building is not the resultof the truck bomb itself, but rather due to other factors such as locally placed chargeswithin the building itself.This report was not presented at McVeigh's trial, together with 4,000 pages ofother evidence that the FBI claimed to have \"lost\". The FBI, the same FBI now\"investigating\" 9/11, also interviewed General Partin but did nothing when heshowed that the official story was impossible. He sent copies of his detailedengineering analysis, including colour photographs, to every member of Congressand more than 1,000 media organisations. Only a handful of replies came back.They would rather the orchestrators of mass murder remain at large than revealthat the government and its agencies are lying at every turn. Yet people still say tome that if the conspiracy I am exposing were true the media would tell us about it!Researcher J. Orlin Grabbe and others have revealed that a secret Pentagon reporton the bombing came to basically the same conclusions as Partin. Grabbe says thePentagon commissioned nine explosives experts to write reports and accepted twoof them as the \"official\" report.' He says he spoke to both experts, but they declinedto be interviewed because of \"confidentiality agreements with the Pentagon\".Grabbe says that sources familiar with the Pentagon report told him that theconclusions were the same as those of General Partin, except that the Pentagonreport concluded there were demolition charges placed on five columns, not thefour suggested by Partin.These findings are not only supported by the science, but by witness accounts.Many said they heard more than one explosion. A 500-page report by the OklahomaCity Bombing Investigation Commission said that many witnesses \"have testified tohearing a second bomb\" and that \"explosives experts contend that the extent of thedamage to the building could not have resulted from a single truck bomb ...\"9Theseismographic record at the Oklahoma Geological Survey (OGS) at the Universityof Oklahoma recorded two \"seismic events\" at the time the Murrah Building washit and a geophysicist at the OGS, Dr Raymon L. Brown, toldNew Americanmagazine that the simplest explanation for this was that there were \"two separateexplosions\".10Witnesses support this. After rescuers arrived on the scene there weremany reports of other bombs being found and defused, and the area was evacuated"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre DisasterPlay it again, scam\tL51several times. Volunteers at the site and television viewers remember how thepolice and fire authorities warned that another device, or devices, had been foundin the rubble. If you watch recordings of stations like KFOR-TV, Channel 9 News,and Channel 4 News from that morning you see the reporters and witnesses talkingof other bombs on the site that had not exploded. (You can see this footage in thevideo911 - The Road To Tyranny,presented by Alex Jones. It is available throughInfowars.com)Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating tells one interviewer: \"Reportsthat I have is that one device was deactivated, apparently there's another device ...\"A television presenter quotes the FBI as saying that the explosion was caused by a\"very sophisticated device and had to have been done by an explosives expert\". Aspokesman for the rescue teams says that they are not able to get into the wreckageto retrieve the injured because of the unexploded bombs still in the building. Areporter with KWTV said that he had just seen a bomb squad truck going towardsthe Murrah Building to defuse another device. Senator Charles Key's OklahomaBombing Investigation Committee confirmed these reports. It concluded: \"There issufficient evidence to confirm that law enforcement agencies in Oklahoma City, aswell as Washington DC, had sufficient prior knowledge of the impending disaster,yet took minimum measures to avert the bombing. Documents and witnessessupport this conclusion.\" The report said there were at least four sightings of otherbombs in the building.\" According to police logs and firefighter witnesses, it wasthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) that removed these unexplodedbombs from the scene. This is the organisation that was supposed to have beenMcVeigh's target in the official cover story. We were told at different times that otherbombs were found, no other bombs were found, and that bombs were found, butthey were \"dummies\" used for training by the ATF. Soon all of this was forgottenand the official version of what happened dominated the media.Rubble troubleThe rubble from the Murrah Building contained the proof of where the bombs werereally located, what they were, and how many there were. All that was required toestablish what had happened beyond doubt was for explosives experts to go in anddo their analysis. General Partin made this very point and requested that the site beprotected so this investigation could take place. He wrote to the Oklahoma SenatorDon Nickles and delivered the letter personally to his Washington office and thoseof some 23 other senators and around 30 congressmen on May 18th 1995. He wrote:\"Iam concerned that vital evidence will soon be destroyed with the pending demolitionof the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. From all the evidence I have seen in thepublished material, I can say with a high level of confidence that the damage pattern onthe reinforced concrete superstructure could not possibly have been attained from thesingle truck bomb without supplementing demolition charges at some of the reinforcedcolumn bases. The total incompatibility with a single truck bomb lies in the fact thateither some of the columns collapsed that should not have collapsed or some of thecolumns are still standing that should have collapsed and did not.\"12"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"152\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want.It's just a choiceright now between fear and love.Instead of listening to General Partin, the government hired a company calledControlled Demolition to bring down the rest of the building and take the rubble toa private landfill site operated by BFI Waste Systems. Here the remains of theMurrah Building were kept under guard by the Wackenhut Corporation, one of theIlluminati's private armies, which I mentioned earlier in relation to the chemicalweapons equipment shipped by Wackenhut to Saddam Hussein before the GulfWar. George Wackenhut, a former FBI operative, started the company with otherFBI associates in 1954, and recruits from the FBI, CIA, and the military havedominated its board. George Wackenhut is a long-time friend of Father Bush andhas funded his political campaigns along with those of Boy George and Floridagovernor Jeb Bush. McVeigh's defence team and independent explosives expertswere refused access to the rubble that would have revealed all. If that is not themost blatant admission that there is something to hide, I don't know what is.Ironically, on its own website Controlled Demolition says of the Murrah contract:\"When a crime scene involves the detonation of explosives, and the possibility ofundetonated materials exist, an experienced contractor is needed to preserveevidence critical to ongoing investigations while dealing with any explosivesdiscovered.\" \" So why was McVeigh's defence not allowed access to any virginremains to conduct such investigations? Controlled Demolition says it was hired towork at the Murrah Building and instigate a \"timely implosion\" of the ruins. Thecompany says on its website:\"[At the request of] ... the General Services Administration (GSA), and subsequentlythat of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Controlled Demolition Incorporated(CDI), was able to assist in analysing the integrity of the unstable Alfred P. MurrahFederal Building in Oklahoma City. Controlled Demolition's team coordinated withrescue and body retrieval efforts by authorities, salvaged evidence for the FBI'sinvestigation, prepared the building for implosion, and completed the demolitionsequence in a continuous work program. Controlled Demolition Incorporated isequipped to work closely with governmental agencies under complex project scenariosthat demand professionalism and attention to detail while working under difficult site,political and emotional conditions.\"14The company is owned by the Loizeaux family and headed by Mark Loizeauxout of Baltimore, just a short drive from Washington DC. In February 2000, aFederal Grand Jury indicted Mark Loizeaux, Douglas Loizeaux and ControlledDemolition on charges of falsely reporting campaign contributions by asking familymembers and employees to donate to the campaign of Elijah E. Cummings, aDemocrat Representative for Maryland. TheBaltimore Sunreported that the illegalcontributions allegedly occurred between 1996 and 1998, but the Loizeaux brothersand the company were acquitted in September 2000. Controlled Demolitioncertainly seems to be well respected by the United States government and itsagencies because it has been awarded federal contracts worth billions. Six yearsafter it carried away the remains of the Alfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma and"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Play it again, scam\t153took it to a safe place guarded by Wackenhut, Controlled Demolition was hired bythe government again for an even bigger job ... removing the remains of the WorldTrade Center.Same old storyAs with 9/11 the government's version of the Oklahoma bombing is a mass of liesand manipulation. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, or the ATF as it isknown, was supposed to be McVeigh's target. How convenient and strange,therefore, that no ATF agents were killed or injured because they were miraculouslynot in the office that morning. There were no badge-carrying federal agents in thebuilding, only civilian workers.\" When these facts became known, the ATF wheeledout agent Alex McCauley who told of the heroic efforts to help to rescue victims byhimself and a fellow agent, who was said to have fallen three floors in an elevatorand survived. But Duane James, the building maintenance supervisor, provedtechnically and logistically that the story was a lie. It was \"pure fantasy\", he said,and the ATF had to retract the story and admit that McCauley was nowhere nearthe building let alone in it. They will not, however, say where he or any of theirother personnel were.\" Federal Judge Wayne Alley was not in his chambers acrossthe street from the Murrah Building either. He told theOregoniannewspaper that hehad decided not to go to work that day because \"there had been talk\". He said:\"Let me just say that within the past two or three weeks, information has beendisseminated ... that indicated concerns on the part of people who ought to know, thatwe ought to be a little more careful ... My subjective impression was there was areason for a dissemination of these concerns.\"17In other words, he was warned off and took the advice. Witnesses who spokewith ATF agents at the scene have confirmed this. When asked if any of their menwere injured they said they were not in the building because they had been tippedoff through their pagers not to go into work that day. Tiffany Bible, a paramedicwho was at the Murrah Building within minutes of the blasts, swore in an affidavitthat she found the ATF in full combat gear (which apparently takes half an hour toput on) and they said they had been warned not to go to work that day.Why was the bomb squad on sitebeforethe bombing?Glenn and Kathy Wilburn, who lost two small children in the bombing, workedconstantly and passionately for years to uncover the truth of what happened. Theyconducted and documented more than 300 hours of interviews, and persuadedpeople to talk who had remained silent for fear of the consequences. Theyestablished beyond question that a heavily armed bomb squad had been indowntown Oklahoma near the Murrah Building that morning before the bombsexploded. Many people saw them, including Oklahoma lawyer Daniel J. Adomitis,who was heading for a charity board meeting at 7.30am, an hour and a half beforethe explosion:"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"154\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.\"There was this fairly large truck with a trailer behind it. It had a shield on the side ofthe door that said 'bomb disposal' or 'bomb squad' below it. And I really found thatinteresting. You know, I'd never seen anything like that in person.\"18Some parents saw these people in their bomb squad uniforms as they droppedtheir children off at the day care centre at the Murrah Building, children they wouldnever see alive again. Eventually, after months of denial by the FBI and othergovernment agencies, the Sheriff's Department had to admit that the bomb squadhad been there. The Wilburns were bitterly attacked by other bereaved families asthey challenged the government story and they were denounced as \"conspiracytheorists\". But in the end other families also became convinced that the authoritieshad prior knowledge of the bombing - just as they had about 9/11. The Wilburnsand many other families filed legal claims against the US government alleging theyhad \"detailed prior knowledge of the planned bombing of the Murrah Building yetfailed to prevent the bombing from taking place\" and claimed that ATF agents were\"alerted not to go to work on April 19th 1995\".19A few more little gems about the Oklahoma bombing. In early April, shortlybefore the attack, a Ryder truck was photographed from the air within the concretewalls of a military compound near Camp Gruber-Braggs, Oklahoma, and you cansee these pictures on the Internet.\" Danny Colson, the FBI's director of the terroristtask force, toldTimemagazine in 1999 that when he heard of the blast he had drivento Oklahoma from his home in Dallas at speeds of 100 miles an hour to support therescue operation and the \"investigation\". Oops, Danny boy, caught by the roundones there darlin'. Colson checked into the Embassy Suites Hotel in Oklahoma at12.20am on April 19th ... just 9 hours before the bomb went off.\" Why? The FBI saidit found McVeigh's truck rental agency from a vehicle identification number (VIN)on the Ryder truck's rear axle. This axle was somehow found both in the bombcrater (Mayor of Oklahoma press statement) and three blocks away (FBI). Must beone hell of an axle. Wherever it was found, the FBI story is another provable lie.Rear axles of vehicles manufactured in America were not imprinted with a VIN andthe Ryder rental company did not add them to the axles either. The FBI also saysthat McVeigh rented the truck with both his real ID and a false ID. This same FBIhad to admit shortly before McVeigh's first scheduled execution that they hadwithheld 4,304 documents from his defence team and he was given a month-longstay of execution because of this. The FBI's \"star witness\" against McVeigh wasMichael Fortier, who admits doing a deal to testify for the prosecution in return forlighter sentences for gun offences. He told the court that he and McVeigh had madethemselves familiar with the Murrah Building weeks before the bombing toestablish the location of the ATF offices. Well in that case why did McVeigh stop at agas station in the Ryder truck that morning and ask the way to the building? Whywould he do that anyway when he knew he would be recognised and reported afterthe bombing? In that one moment he connected himself to the Ryder truck and theMurrah Building. Why? If he had spent so much time locating the ATF offices, whydid he park the truck on the side of the Murrah Building furthest away from the"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Play it again, scam\t155ATF section when he could have left it directly underneath? We are also asked tobelieve - and depressingly many do - that having connected himself with the Rydertruck and the Murrah Building before the bombing by stopping at the gas station,he then proceeded to \"get away\" undetected in a highly visible yellow cartravelling at nearly 100 miles an hour with expired licence plates, and that when hewas stopped by the police for a traffic violation a man who had just murdered 168people and maimed hundreds made no attempt to avoid arrest even though he wasarmed and a highly trained soldier. It's nonsense, of course it is, but these are thepeople telling us what happened on September 11th, who did it and who we shouldbomb in retaliation.McVeigh was arrested so conveniently for a traffic offence immediately after thebombing for the same reason that Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested in a cinemaimmediately after the Kennedy assassination and Osama bin Laden was named asthe culprit after 9 / 11. They are the patsies required by problem-reaction-solution tohide the real orchestrators. Just as 9/11 was a massive version of what happened inOklahoma, so Oklahoma was a repeat of the Kennedy assassination. Lee HarveyOswald was a US agent who was placed in the right place at the right time withoutbeing told exactly why he was there. He realised this after Kennedy was shot andran.When he was arrested he said he was a patsy, a stooge, and would have said soin court. That's why he was paraded in public to allow another government agent,Jack Ruby, to shoot him and kill the evidence (seeAnd The Truth Shall Set You Free).In the same way, very possibly, McVeigh was a government stooge who parked theRyder truck without knowing the full story. This would explain why he saw noproblem in stopping at the gas station to ask the way to the Murrah building andwhy he made such a \"getaway\" and offered no resistance to the police officer.McVeigh apparently said that he was not told what the project was really all aboutand had been trapped, \"framed\", and made a patsy to cover up high-level USgovernment complicity.22Father Bush and the Iraqi connectionI almost completed a section without mentioning the Bush family, but naturally thatcouldn't last. It will stagger Americans to learn that at the end of the Gulf War in1991 President Father George Bush arranged for around 4,000 officers from themilitary and intelligence agencies of Iraq, mostly from the Republican Guard, torelocate in the United States; 2,000 of these officers became resident in ... Oklahoma.Another 500 went to Lincoln, Nebraska. Father Bush arranged for their funding,housing and employment, and this has been continued by Bill Clinton and BabyBush. Jayna Davis, a former reporter with NBC affiliate KFOR-TV in Oklahoma, hasworked tirelessly since the bombing to uncover the true story. In 1996 theNew YorkTimesCompany bought her television station and stopped her reports, but she hascontinued to uncover devastating information. She has established that more than70 witnesses saw McVeigh with other men and that more than 20 of these sightingsinvolved men with Middle Eastern features. A sketch of a man with \"olive skin\"seen with McVeigh was released by the FBI immediately after the bombing and he"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"156\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want.

But the FBI has withheld at least 12 surveillancecamera videos showing what happened and who was there that morning, and 1,034fingerprints taken by the FBI have never been checked.23Jayna Davis' lawyer isDavid Schippers, who led the impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton andrepresents FBI agents who had their investigations into terrorist suspects blockedby their superiors before 9 / 11. Schippers said of the FBI's manipulation of witnessevidence relating to Oklahoma:\"Some of these people who gave affidavits were interviewed by the FBI during thecourse of the investigation. They were interviewed about the second person they sawand the agents tried to make them say that the second person was Nichols. Everysingle one of these people said absolutely not, it was a Middle Eastern type individual.Now, listen to this, none of those 302s, none of those investigative reports, have eversurfaced.\"24Jayna Davis has produced a detailed dossier and interviewed witnesses whohave said they will testify that they saw McVeigh with a former Iraqi soldier wholived in Oklahoma City at the time of the bombing. This man surrendered duringthe Gulf War and was resettled in the United States from a detention camp in SaudiArabia.\" Immediately after the blast, the FBI put out an All-Points Bulletin forMiddle Eastern-looking suspects seen fleeing the scene in a brown Chevroletpickup with tinted windows and a bug shield.\" As James Patterson, an editorialwriter on theIndianapolis Star,remarked: \"Something here doesn't pass the smelltest.\"27The FBI has refused to release the videotapes collected from surveillancecameras around the Murrah Building because they are \"part of the investigation\"(the traditional excuse), but TV reporter Brad Edwards located a source who hadseen parts of them. Edwards presented a reconstruction for viewers on NewsChannel 4 of what his source claimed to have seen:\"The source said that the tapes show two men inside [the Ryder truck]. One stronglyresembling Timothy McVeigh gets out of the driver's side, steps down, he then appearsto have dropped something on the step up into the truck. He bends down and appearsto pick something up off the step. Then he turns and walks directly across this streettowards the General Electric building. All this time John Doe number two is still insidethe Ryder truck's cab sitting on the passenger side. Time passes. The surveillance tapeis time-lapse photography. Without knowing exactly the time interval between shots oursource can't be sure how long John Doe number two sat in that cab. What was he doingall that time? Then the tape shows John Doe number two getting out of the passengerside of the Ryder truck. Again the tape shows that a bombing witness accuratelydescribed what happened next to News Channel 4 ... the tape shows John Doe twogetting out, shutting the passenger side door. He steps towards the front of the truckand is momentarily out of the frame of the surveillance camera. But shortly he appearsback in frame walking towards the rear of the truck, still on the sidewalk in the front ofthe Murrah Building.\"28"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Play it again, scam\t157The source said that \"John Doe\" wore a baseball cap, was taller than the manresembling McVeigh, and had an olive complexion. This was supported by manywitnesses, including a man interviewed with a blacked-out face and featured in thereport by Brad Edwards:\"Iwas standing in the building and I looked out the window and I seen the Ryder truck and Iseen a man get out of the Ryder truck. He was olive complexion and he was ... he hadblack curly hair. He was wearing a baseball cap but his curls were sticking out of his hat. Itwas very short in the back but you could still see the curls in his hair. He was not American,he was foreign, you could tell by his skin, his face, and the way his face was ...\"Senator Charles Key, who helped to produce a report on Oklahoma, said hisunderstanding was that there is a video showing McVeigh and John Doe 2 gettingout of the Ryder Truck and into another pick up. \"Where is that video ... are wegoing to get to see it?\" he asks. Erryou must be joking, the FBI replies. Incidentally Iwas on a radio show in America in May 2002 talking about the way the FBI hadrefused to release these surveillance camera tapes. A former FBI agent came on theline saying loudly and vehemently that he worked on the case and there were nosurveillance tapes. It took a member of the public to come on tell him that not onlydid the tapes exist, the FBI had admitted this on the national news! In 2001 the FBIsaid it was not going to release the tapes at all because of \"national security\" (thesecurity of the official lie). When McVeigh went on trial the FBI did not use thetapes in prosecution because they would have destroyed its story. If only McVeighand no one else had been on the tapes, the world would have seen them withinhours of the blast. Rule number one of cover stories: if letting the public seesomething would support your cover story you let them see it. If the public seeingsomething would destroy your cover story you don't let them see it. Surveillancecameras are part of the Illuminati system of control, but they are also a problem forthem when they carry out their public operations. Therefore we have a clear redflag test on these occasions - are we allowed to see the surveillance camera tapes ofthe scene in question? There are 17 surveillance cameras working 24 hours a dayalong the route of the last journey taken by Princess Diana between the Ritz Hoteland the Pont de L'Alma tunnel in Paris. But at that time, of all times, every singleone of the 17 cameras was \"not working\" - or so we are told. James Patterson of theIndianapolis Starwrote that critical evidence that several Middle Eastern men mayhave been connected to the Oklahoma bombing appeared to have been kept fromthe public by the FBI. He added:\"Officially, the FBI has dismissed the possibility of a John Doe No. 2, an olive-skinnedman whose sketch they released immediately after the bombing, or other suspects. Butcurrent and former FBI agents in Oklahoma City say they received documents pointingto another person or even a cell of Middle Eastern operatives. At a minimum, Congressshould question one former FBI agent who says he obtained 22 affidavits and morethan 30 witness statements describing sightings of Middle Easterners with McVeigh.\"29"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"158\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.Hoppy Heidelberg, a prominent Oklahoma horse breeder, was dismissed fromthe grand jury \"investigating\" the case when he went public with his complaintsthat the \"investigation\" was a sham. He said he was not allowed to ask forwitnesses, even though it was his lawful right, and one of the areas he wanted toexplore was the reports of the \"John Doe 2\". He said he was visited by FBI agentsbrandishing guns who said that if he knew what was good for him he would shutup. Apparently state, local and federal police detained dozens of Middle Easternmen after the bombing as they tried to leave the United States, and these included\"former\" members of the Iraqi Republican Guard. It has been reported that in theirpossession were bomb-making materials, but President Clinton insisted they werereleased. David Schippers, the Chief Investigative Counsel for the House JudiciaryCommittee Impeachment Hearing of Bill Clinton, said that the same team thatcarried out the Oklahoma bombing also carried out the September 11th attacks. Hesaid that he understood a former Iraqi Republican Guard officer called Al-HussainiHussain, who had been mentioned by reporter Jayna Davis as a possible John Doe 2in her investigations into Oklahoma, later worked at Boston Logan Airport wheretwo of the 9 / 11 flights took off.\" Larry Johnson, a former Deputy Director of theState Department's Office on Counterterrorism, toldFox Newsthe same. He said hebelieved that Al-Hussaini Hussain was John Doe 2 in Oklahoma and he added:\"The thing that really concerns me relative to 9 / 11 [is that] when he left Oklahomaaround 1996 and 1997, he went to work at Logan Airport in Boston. We don't knowwhere he is now.\"31Jayna Davis has testified under oath before a grand jury, and in1997 she attempted to hand over a large part of her evidence to the FBI, but those incontrol were not interested.\" They have shown a similar lack of interest whenoffered information about Osama bin Laden, which would have dismantled theofficial story. Former FBI agent Dan Vogel offered to testify at a hearing of TerryNichols, the man convicted with McVeigh, that he had received from Jayna Davis 22affidavits from witnesses who had seen McVeigh with Middle Eastern men in themonths, weeks and days before the attack and on the morning it happened. Hewanted to testify that he had sent the package to FBI agent Henry C. Gibbons, butthe witness statements were not made public. However, Judge Linder ruled thatVogel could not make this devastating testimony because the [In] JusticeDepartment did not want the evidence to be heard and would not authorise thetestimony.\"Waco revisitedThe FBI and the ATF were, with others, responsible for the mass murder of men,women and children at Waco, Texas, on April 19th 1993. If they had something onDavid Koresh, the leader of the Branch Davidians, they could have arrested himmonths earlier when he often left the compound. But these people are mentallydisturbed and the plan was for a ritual murder by fire. Adolf Hitler and the Nazis,who were serious black occultists (see my previous books) chose the same day,April 19th, to burn the Jewish ghetto in Warsaw in 1943. The Nazis torched theghetto block by block and then flooded and smoke-bombed the sewers when the"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre DisasterPlay it again, scam\t159Jews tried to use them to escape. What the ATF and FBI did at Waco was virtuallyidentical. According to the occult law followed so slavishly by the Illuminati andtheir agents, April 19th and 20th are dedicated to their god Baal and demand bloodsacrifice. The Columbine High School shooting at Littleton, Colorado, was on April20th 1999 and also involved the ATF and the FBI; so did Oklahoma - on April 19th.I cannot stress enough the obsession these people have with occult ritual and Iexplore this in detail inThe Biggest Secret. Twobrilliant documentaries,Waco: TheRules of Engagement(1997) andWaco: A New Revelation(1999) devastatingly exposethe mass murder by the FBI and ATF, and the involvement at the highest levels ofthe US government.\" TheRules of Engagementwon an Emmy for best investigativejournalism. The follow-up,A New Revelation, isactually narrated by former FBISpecial Agent Dr Frederic Whitehurst. It was Dr Whitehurst who exposed thecriminal manipulation of evidence and the stunning \"incompetence\" at the FBIcrime laboratory. The documentaries reveal how the authorities used \"flash-bang\"devices to start the fire that engulfed the Mount Carmel compound at Waco afterfilling the compound with high explosives and poisonous gas. The devices werefound at all locations where the fires started, but were claimed to have beensilencers and gun parts. They also show how \"shape\" charges were placed bymilitary operatives at the top of a concrete walk-in-cooler that became a \"bunker\"where the women and children sought to escape from the lethal concentrations ofCS gas. The \"shape\" charges blew a hole in the concrete roof, killed everyoneinside, and caused the partial disintegration and fusing together of some of thebodies of the women and children because of the pressure and heat from the blast.Military explosives expert General Benton Partin supports this version of events,and shape charges have also been identified by some researchers in relation to theMurrah Building in Oklahoma and the World Trade Center towers on September11th. Gene Cullen, a CIA service officer, is among the sources that confirm howDelta Force, the elite (and brain dead) unit of the US military, was at the compoundduring the \"siege\". Delta Force fired on anyone who tried to flee the compoundthrough the only escape route, and they either died this way or in the inferno. TheFBI claims to have tapes of the Davidians planning to set the compound alight, butthey have never produced them because they are lying. The FBI, the source of theofficial story of September 11th, has some very decent, dedicated people workingat the foot soldier levels. But the FBI and related agencies are controlled higher upthe pyramid by some of the most unbalanced and corrupt people currentlyresident on planet earth. What was the outcome for the FBI and ATF after Waco?Their funding was increased. After Oklahoma? Same. After September 11th? Whatdo you think?The FBI, like the ATF, is a deeply corrupt organisation - and the FBI is the sourcethrough which the official version of September 11th has been sold to the world.The Illuminati elements within the United States government and others, not leastthe British, have a long and horrendous history of terrorist activity. They often useforeign front men to carry out the attacks, but it is they who plan and orchestratethem.

He survived, but more than 80 worshippers were killed. Robert \"Iran-Contra\" McFarlane, Reagan's National Security Adviser, said that the bombers\"may have been trained by the US, but the individuals who carried it out wererogue operatives\" and the CIA in no way sanctioned or supported the attack.\" Surethey didn't and, by the way, spaghetti grows on trees.Pearl HarborGeorge W. Bush called the events of September 11th \"Our Pearl Harbor\" and foronce he was right, although not in the way he wanted us to believe. Interestingly,months earlier a blockbuster movie had been released by Hollywood amid massivepromotion about this very attack by the Japanese Air Force on Pearl Harbor,Hawaii, in 1941. It was the attack that took the United States into the Second WorldWar. To this day popular accounts of history portray President Franklin DelanoRoosevelt, a Bush family relative, as a man who \"strove in vain to ward off war\".'This is yet another gross misrepresentation. Both the Roosevelts and the Delanos arebloodline and I mentioned earlier that his grandfather, Warren Delano, was a majoroperator in the drug networks operated by the Russell family, the founders of theSkull and Bones Society. Delano also worked in the drugs network of the Britishgovernment in Asia, China and the Far East in general. When Roosevelt wasseeking re-election as president in 1940 he repeated the same mantra: \"... while I amtalking to you, mothers and fathers, I give you one more assurance. I have said thisbefore but I shall say it again and again and again; your boys are not going to besent into any foreign wars!\"\" He even had the nerve to add that: \"You can thereforenail any talk about sending armies to Europe as deliberate untruth.\"\" This is whatpeople wanted to hear and he was re-elected. Roosevelt, however, an Illuminatistooge to his fingertips, knew that the sons and many daughters of America weregoing to war again very soon. What he needed was an event of such magnitude thatAmerica would go to war while, at the same time, Roosevelt would be cleared ofany responsibility for going back on his clear and constantly repeated pledge of theelection campaign. The Illuminati plan, long known by Roosevelt, was to engineeran attack on the United States that would so anger public opinion that peoplewould agree to go to war against the aggressor and join the European conflict also.As a member of Woodrow Wilson's administration in the First World War,Roosevelt would have been well schooled in manipulating public opinion withengineered events. In 1939, Senator P. Nye of North Dakota said that he had seen aseries of volumes called The Next War. These included one entitled Propaganda in theNext War and these were written before there was any talk of a Second World War.As Senator Nye revealed, the material included the plan for manipulating publicopinion into accepting American involvement in another global conflict, whichthese documents revealed was coming. The propaganda document, whichoriginated in Britain, said:"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Play it again, scam\t161\"To persuade her [the United States] to take our part will be much more difficult, sodifficult as to be unlikely to succeed. It will need a definite threat to America, a threatmoreover, which will have to be brought home to every citizen, before the Republicagain take arms in an external quarrel ...\"The position will naturally be considerably eased ifJapanwereinvolved,and this mightand probably would bring America in without much further ado. [My emphasis.] At anyrate, it would be a natural and obvious effect of our propagandists to achieve this, justas in the Great War, they succeeded in embroiling the United States with Germany ...\"Fortunately with America, our propaganda is on firm ground. We can be entirelysincere, as our main plank will be the old democratic one. We must clearly enunciateour belief in the Democratic form of government, and our firm resolve to adhere to ...the old Goddess of Democracy.\"39Sound familiar in the months since September 11th? The Council on ForeignRelations (CFR) is an Illuminati front in the United States formed and dominated bythe Rockefeller family. It is part of a web that includes the Bilderberg Group, TrilateralCommission, and the London-based Royal Institute of International Affairs. Thisnetwork is described in detail inAnd The Truth Shall Set You FreeandThe Biggest Secret.Itwas the Council on Foreign Relations that devised the plan to antagonise Japan tosuch a degree that it would attack the United States. At the forefront of this wasRoosevelt's Secretary of War, Henry Stimson, a founder of the CFR. In his diary hewrote, \"We face the delicate question of diplomatic fencing to be done so as to be surethat Japan is put into the wrong and makes the first bad overt move.\"4°The CFR'sWar and Peace Studies Project sent a memo to Roosevelt suggesting that aid be givento China during her conflict with Japan and that Japanese assets in the US be frozen, atrade embargo imposed and Japan refused access to the Panama Canal. I canrecommend an excellent book calledPearl Harbor, The Story of the Secret War,byGeorge Morgenstern, which sets out how the Japanese were goaded into the attack onPearl Harbor on December 7th 1941.41Roosevelt, an Illuminati bloodline whollyowned by the Council on Foreign Relations, set about provoking Japan into an attackwith a number of measures, including the targeting of Japanese oil supplies. For fouryears before the attack the Roosevelt administration had been intercepting anddecoding secret Japanese messages. They knew that the Japanese intended to alerttheir diplomatic centres around the world of a decision to go to war through a falseweather report during the daily Japanese-language short-wave news broadcast. Theforecast of \"east wind rain\" indicated war with the United States; \"west wind clear\"would mean a decision to go to war with Britain, and British and Dutch colonies inthe east; \"north wind cloudy\" meant war with Russia.As a Congressional investigation heard in 1945, the messages indicating adecision to go to war with the United States and Britain, though not with Russia,were intercepted and decoded on December 3rd 1941 - four days before PearlHarbor.42These messages subsequently went \"missing\" from Navy files. Other"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"162\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.decoded messages gave Roosevelt prior warning of the attack, but the public werenot told and nor were the sitting targets in Hawaii. On January 27th 1941, JosephGrew, the US Ambassador to Tokyo, had written to Roosevelt to say that in the eventof war, Pearl Harbor would be the first target.' In all, Roosevelt had informationfrom eight different sources indicating a probable attack.' The historian RobertStinnett revealed the results of 17 years of research into the Pearl Harbor conspiracyin his book,Day of Deceit: The Truth About FDR and Pearl Harbor45His researchincluded more than a million documents obtained under the Freedom of InformationAct, which show that knowledge of the Japanese plans was kept from commandersin Hawaii - the very same men who were later made scapegoats for what happened.Stinnett uncovered a memo written on October 7th 1940 by Lt Commander ArthurMcCollum, who headed the Far East section of US Naval Intelligence. McCollumconfirms the policy of systematically provoking the Japanese to attack the UnitedStates in order to provide the political and public motivation for the declaration ofwar. The attack was purely to manipulate American public opinion into agreeing totake part in another Illuminati war that had long been planned, and no one wasmore duped than the Japanese. They had been tricked into attacking the US both bythe Americans and the Germans. The German Foreign Minister, Joachim vonRibbentrop, had been pressing the Japanese to attack the United States. OnDecember 6th 1941 Hitler had added to the Japanese resolve by indicating thatGerman forces were about to enter Moscow. On December 8th, the day after PearlHarbor, the Germans were found to be in retreat from the Russian front. More than3,000 people were killed at Pearl Harbor, about the same as the official death toll onSeptember 11th, and they were yet more victims of the Illuminati agenda. The dayafter Pearl Harbor, Allen Dulles, an Illuminati agent, Hitler supporter and cousin tothe Rockefellers, was appointed to the staff of the Office of the Coordinator ofInformation. This later became the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and then theCIA. It was he who was sacked by John F. Kennedy as head of the CIA and thenserved on the Warren Commission to \"investigate\" the JFK assassination. The PearlHarbor plan worked brilliantly as public opinion reacted exactly as required to theattack on American soil. The United States was involved in another war in Europeand \"our boys\" who, according to Roosevelt, were not going to be sent into anotherEuropean conflict, were now on their way, many of them to die. Winston Churchill,the Illuminati bloodline Prime Minister in Britain and a relative of Roosevelt and theBushes, said of the news: \"That is what I have dreamed of, aimed at, and worked for,and now it has come to pass\".46He might have added: \"and I always knew it wasgoing to\". The influence on Roosevelt of the Council on Foreign Relations, with itsmembership throughout the government, banking, commerce, media and military,cannot be overestimated. Roosevelt's son-in-law, Curtis Dall, said:\"For a long time I felt that [Roosevelt] ... had developed many thoughts and ideas that werehis own to benefit this country, the USA. But he didn't. Most of his thoughts, his political`ammunition', as it were, were carefully manufactured for him in advance by the Council onForeign Relations - One World Money Group. Brilliantly, with great gusto, like a fine piece of"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Play it again, scam\t163artillery, he exploded that `ammunition' in the middle of on unsuspecting target, theAmerican people - and thus paid off and retained his internationalist support.\"4'The Roosevelt mansion on East 65th Street in New York was actually next door tothe Council on Foreign Relations and it was a committee known as the InformalAgenda Group, packed with members of the CFR, which wrote the proposal for theUnited Nations and handed it to Roosevelt who made it public on June 16th 1944 asif he was the architect.' Henry Louis Mencken writes inThe American Language49thatthe term \"United Nations\" was first mentioned by Roosevelt in a meeting withChurchill at the White House in December 1941 - the month of Pearl Harbor.\" Some74 members of the Council on Foreign Relations were in the US delegation at thefounding meeting of the United Nations, which was created from the start as avehicle for eventual world government. The Rockefellers donated the land on whichthe UN building in Manhattan is built, as they did the site of the headquarters of theearlier League of Nations in Switzerland. This was their first attempt to create astalking horse for the global centralisation of political power. The Rockefellers werealso responsible for the building of two other famous buildings in Manhattan ... thetwin towers of the World Trade Center. The Council on Foreign Relations, foundedin 1921, has its members in key positions throughout the US government, military,and media today, and many of the people telling us what happened on September11th and who was responsible are from the ranks of the CFR - just as they were withPearl Harbor, the Oklahoma bombing and so many other problem-reaction-solutionsof the last 80 years.Operation NorthwoodsIn April 2001, just four months before September 11th, a book was published byJames Bamford, who was formerly the Washington Investigative Producer forWorldNews Tonightwith Peter Jennings on ABC Television. It was calledBody of Secrets'and revealed a plan hatched 40 years ago by America's top military leaders, theJoints Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon, to commit acts of terrorism in US cities, killcivilians and blame it on the Cuban president Fidel Castro. The plan was calledOperation Northwoods, and was designed to win public and international supportfor an invasion of Cuba that would remove Castro. Bamford quotes military leadersas writing: \"We could blow up a US ship in Guantanamo Bay and blame Cuba\",and \"casualty lists in US newspapers would cause a helpful wave of nationalindignation\". The Joint Chiefs of Staff also proposed to kill the astronaut John Glennduring the first attempt to put an American into orbit and blame that on Cuba, thedocuments reveal. If Glenn's rocket exploded, \"the objective is to provideirrevocable proof ... that the fault lies with the Communists et all Cuba [sic],\" saythe Northwood documents. Bamford writes:\" ...the plan, which had the written approval of the Chairman and every member of theJoint Chiefs of Staff, called for innocent people to be shot on American streets; forboats carrying refugees fleeing Cuba to be sunk on the high seas; for a wave of violent"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"164\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.terrorism to be launched in Washington DC, Miami, and elsewhere. People would beframed for bombings they did not commit; planes would be hijacked. Using phoneyevidence, all of it would be blamed on Castro, thus giving Lemnitzer [the Chairman ofthe Joint Chiefs of Staff] and his cabal the excuse, as well as the public andinternational backing, they needed to launch their war.\"52The plan was to stir up so much hatred for Cuba in the United States that thepeople would support an invasion and even demand that this was done. Theyintended to explode plastic bombs, arrest Cuban agents and release previouslyprepared documents falsely substantiating Cuban involvement. The plan includedattacks on the now infamous US base at Guantanamo Bay on Cuba where, since theinvasion of Afghanistan, the \"Land of Freedom\" has kept untried and uncharged\"terrorists\" in disgraceful, inhuman, conditions. These attacks on the base would beblamed on Castro. The documents speak of \"a series of well co-ordinated incidents... in and around Guantanamo to give genuine appearance of being done by hostileCuban forces\".\" A Memorandum of July 27th 1962 says that the operation wouldmean an enormous increase in Cuban and American casualties.' The techniques tobe used included: starting rumours; using clandestine radio; landing friendlyCubans in uniform \"over the fence\" to stage \"attacks\" on the base; capturing(friendly) Cuban saboteurs inside the base; starting riots near the base main gateusing friendly Cubans; blowing up ammunition inside the base and starting fires;burning aircraft on the base and blaming Cuba; throwing mortar shells into thebase; capturing assault teams approaching from the sea or Guantanamo City;capturing a militia group which storms the base to sabotage a ship in harbour;sinking a ship near the harbour entrance; blowing up an unmanned vessel in Cubanwater and blaming it on Cuban aircraft that would naturally come and investigatewhat had happened; issue false casualty lists to the US media to whip up publicopinion against Cuba; and, look at this ... \"conduct funerals for mock victims.\"55The Northwoods documents also call for the use of Soviet Union MIG-typelookalike aircraft flown by US pilots to harass civil aircraft, attack surface shippingand destroy US military \"drone\" (remotely controlled) aircraft to give theimpression it was all done by Communists. \"An F-86 properly painted wouldconvince air passengers that they saw a Cuban MIG ...\" one document says.\" It wasfurther planned to stage the mock shooting-down of a US Air Force plane ininternational waters by simply getting the pilot, using a made-up name, to reportthat he was under attack and then stop transmitting. He would then fly back to hisbase where the plane would be repainted with a new tail number and the pilotwould resume his real name. A US submarine would send aircraft to search forwreckage in the sea and this would be found to confirm the attack and blame it onCuba. James Bamford's book is a history of the biggest intelligence operation inAmerica, the National Security Agency (NSA), which makes the CIA look like awhimpering poodle. Bamford says the NSA was not involved in OperationNorthwoods, but I don't agree. I don't buy the \"it was just the Pentagon\" line at all.Of course the NSA would be involved in such an operation, as it would have been"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Play it again, scam\t165in 9 / 11. Bamford says the plans for these terrorist acts against American targets hadthe written approval of all the Joint Chiefs of Staff, headed by Eisenhower'sappointee, Army General Lyman L. Lemnitzer, and were presented by RobertMcNamara, the [Illuminati] Defense Secretary, to President Kennedy in March 1962.Eventually the \"civilian leadership\" rejected them and three days later PresidentKennedy told Lemnitzer there was virtually no chance of ever using overt force totake Cuba. Operation Northwoods remained secret for 40 years until thesedocuments came to light. Bamford told his former employers atABCNews:\"These were Joint Chiefs of Staff documents. The reason these were held secret for solong is the Joint Chiefs never wanted to give these up because they were soembarrassing. The whole point of a democracy is to have leaders responding to thepublic will, and here this is the complete reverse, the military trying to trick theAmerican people into a war that they want but that nobody else wants.\"57Why, one is right to wonder, do they allow the public to hear of this these onlymonths before a very similar plan unfolded on September 11th 2001? Bamford writesthat even after the original plans were rejected, others continued to be developed,such as creating a war between Cuba and another Latin American country thatwould allow the US to intervene. It is no good people claiming their leaders couldnot have been behind the horrors of 9/11 when the documents exist to show that thePentagon had planned in detail something very similar 40 years ago. And wait forthis ...Operation Northwoods also planned the hijacking of civil aircraft. Thedocuments say it was possible to create an incident that would convince the peoplethat the Cuban aircraft had shot down a chartered civil airliner on a flight from theUnited States to Jamaica, Guatemala, Venezuela or Panama. The destination wouldbe chosen so the route would cross Cuba and the plan was to replace the civil airlinerwith an identical one remotely controlled from the ground and painted in the samecolours. The real plane would be landed at an Air Force base and the passengers,boarded under aliases, would be taken off. The remotely controlled replacementwould then be flown over Cuba, send a distress signal and be destroyed by radiosignal. And all this was planned 40 years ago. Imagine what the technology is liketoday by comparison? James Bamford writes inBody of Secrets:\"An aircraft at Elgin AFB would be painted and numbered as an exact duplicate for acivil registered aircraft belonging to a CIA proprietary organization in the Miami area. Ata designated time the duplicate would be substituted for the actual civil aircraft andwould be loaded with the selected passengers, all boarded under carefully preparedaliases.

Thedrone aircraft meanwhile will continue to fly the filed flight plan. When over Cuba thedrone will be transmitting on the international distress frequency a \"May Day\" messagestating he is under attack by Cuban MiG aircraft. The transmission will be interrupted bydestruction of the aircraft, which will be triggered by radio signal. This will allow ICAO[International Civil Aviation Organisation] radio stations in the Western Hemisphere to tellthe US what has happened to the aircraft instead of the US trying to 'sell' the incident.\"Forty years later, in New York and Washington, something remarkably similarhappened on 9/11 and, for Fidel Castro, read Osama bin Laden. Also it was clearlypossible 40 years ago for transmissions to be made from an aircraft in which therewere no pilots or passengers on board. You can see from these examples, and Icould quote so many more, that the problem-reaction-solution techniques that wereemployed on September 11th are nothing new. Like I say, if it keeps working, whychange it?SOURCES1\tH.R. 25802http://www.rense.com/genera[17/fly.htm3\tMSNBC, video streaming, June 11th 2001; see alsohttp://www.skoinicksreport.com/claffair2.htmi4Oklahoma City Bombing, Expert Analysis:http://www.cowan70.freeserve.co.uk/miscellaneous/oklahoma bombing expert analysis.html5http://www.brasscheck.com/OKBOMB6Oklahoma City Bombing, Expert Analysis:http://www.cowan70.freeserve.co.uk/miscellaneous/oklahoma_bombing_expert analysis.html7\tCase Study Relating Blast Effects to the Events of April 19, 1995.

This becomes obviouswhen you observe both the attacks and their aftermath. In this chapter I will outlinethe official story of what happened and the response that followed. I should stressthat many of the \"facts\" in this official version depend on which spokesman oragency you speak to because they often contradict each other.The US government and its \"security\" agencies like the CIA and FBI say theyhad no idea that a terrorist attack was planned on that beautiful east coast morningas tens of thousands of people began their working day in the office complexes ofManhattan and at the headquarters of the American military at the Pentagon inWashington DC. These \"security\" agencies employ together perhaps 100,000 peoplein the United States and worldwide, and devour some $35 billion from UStaxpayers every year (and that's only the official funds). Yet they claim not to haveuncovered one single piece of information to suggest that some \"19 Arab terrorists\"(part of a network of perhaps 50, it is suggested) were planning to simultaneouslyhijack four US commercial aircraft in American airspace and crash them into thevery symbols of US military and financial power. The first they knew, so the storygoes, was when it was far too late to respond. That is an outrageous lie to be filedwith all the rest and has been revealed as such.The ProblemAt 7.59am that Tuesday morning, American Airlines Flight 11, a Boeing 767, took offfrom Logan International Airport in Boston heading for Los Angeles. On boardwere 81 passengers, two pilots and nine flight attendants. Following along therunway soon afterwards was United Airlines Flight 175, another Boeing 767, whichdeparted at 8.14am, also for LA. It was carrying 56 passengers, two pilots and sevenflight attendants. At 8.01am, and 150 miles to the south, United Airlines Flight 93169"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"170\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.pulled back from the gate at Newark, New Jersey, and the Boeing 757 began itsroutine journey across America to San Francisco with 38 passengers, two pilots andfive attendants. But for some reason, which United Airlines could not explain whenI asked them, the take-off was delayed and it did not leave the ground until 8.42.Meanwhile, at 8.10, American Airlines Flight 77 left Washington's DullesInternational Airport for Los Angeles with 58 passengers, two pilots and fourattendants aboard a Boeing 757.American Airlines flight 11Figure 10: the course of Flight 11 according to aircraft tracking company Flight ExplorerThe official story claims that shortly after American Airlines Flight 11 took off fromBoston at 7.59 bound for Los Angeles, Arab terrorists hijacked the plane using smallknives and box cutters. The pilot and co-pilot of Flight 11 were John Ogonowskiand Tom McGuinness, a former F-14 Navy Tomcat pilot described as \"big andburly\". Around 14 minutes into the flight they were instructed by air traffic controlto make a 20-degree turn to the right, according to a \"federal official familiar withtranscripts of the air-traffic-control conversations of all four flights\".' The pilotreplied in the normal way of ground to air communications by repeating theinstruction and giving the flight code: \"20 right, AAL11\". Very soon after this, thepilot was asked to climb to 35,000 feet, but there was no response. The following isclaimed to be a transcript of the exchange that took place at about 8.13am, 14minutes into the flight:Boston Control Center:\"AAL11 turn 20 degrees right.\"AAL11:\"20 right AAL11.\"Controller A:\"AAL11 now climb maintain FL350 [35,000 feet].\"Controller A:\"AAL11 climb maintain FL350.\"Controller A:\"AAL11 Boston.\"Controller A:\"AAL11, ah, the American on the frequency how do you hear me?\"Controller B breaks in:\"This is Athens.\""},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Problem-Reaction-Solution\t171Controller A:\"This is Boston. I turned American 20 left and I was going to climb him;he will not respond to me now at all.\"ControllerB:\"Looks like he's turning right.\"Controller A:\"Yeah, I turned him right.\"ControllerB:\"Oh, O.K.\"Controller A:\"And he's only going to, um, I think 29.\"ControllerB:\"Sure that's fine.\"Controller A:\"Eh, but I'm not talking to him.\"ControllerB:\"He won't answer you. He's nordo [no radar] roger. Thanks.\"2So the first sign of a problem that morning was shortly after 8.13am and it isclaimed that only at 8.40 - 27 minutes later - did the Federal AviationAdministration (FAA) inform NORAD, which guards North American airspace,that Flight 11 had been hijacked. Why? We shall see that this is against allprocedures detailed in the Federal Aviation Administration and Pentagoninstruction manuals. The FAA is the civilian government operation that runs theair traffic system in the United States while NORAD, the North AmericanAerospace Defense Command, is an American and Canadian militaryorganisation that is supposed to protect North America against attacks by\"aircraft,missiles, or space vehicles ... ensuring air sovereignty and air defense ofthe airspace of Canada and the United States\".3Iwill have a great deal more tosay about these organisations in due course. It is claimed that after contact waslost with Flight 11, a controller heard a voice from the cockpit at 8.24am that said:\"We have some planes. Just stay quiet and you will be OK. We are returning to theairport. Nobody move.\" The controller is said to have replied: \"Who's trying tocallme?\" But there was no response. Another \"radio transmission\" said to havebeen heard by controllers at 8.33am was: \"Nobody move please. We are goingback to the airport. Don't try to make any stupid moves.\" Two minutes lateranother instruction is said to have been: \"Everything will be OK. If you try tomake any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane. Just stay quiet.\" Ifthat's true, the pilots had time to switch on the microphone in the cockpit, which,the official version says, allowed air traffic controllers to hear the hijackers. Eitherthat or the hijackers were confusing the aircraft radio with the intercom. Strangely,the secret four-digit alert code that warns the ground that a plane has beenhijacked was never sent and that's the first thing a pilot is supposed to do in suchcircumstances. It was the same story with all four aircraft. There was only oneother contact between Flight 11 and air traffic control, the official story goes. Thatwas when controllers were asked for a route, or air corridor, to JFK Airport inNew York, although by whom is not stated by officials. I asked the media office ofthe Federal Aviation Administration who in the cockpit made this request andthey said they did not have that information. Why? The transponder, or IFFbeacon, which allows an aircraft to be more easily tracked on radar and suppliesother information, was switched off at 8.20 over the Hudson River and the planeturned sharply and headed for New York. Losing the transponder would have"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"172\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.made it harder to track the plane, but, I emphasise, it was still very muchtrackable by conventional radar.\"Attendants call from plane\"We are told that flight attendant Madeline Amy Sweeney, a 35-year-old mother oftwo, made a call from the plane to American Airlines Flight Services ManagerMichael Woodward at Boston Logan Airport and said there were four hijackers onboard (the FBI claims there were five). She said they had stabbed two flightattendants, we are told. She is claimed to have said: \"A hijacker cut the throat of abusiness class passenger and he appears to be dead.\" The terrorists, Sweeney said,\"had just gained access to the cockpit.\"4This begs the question of why the pilotshad not sent the hijack code if things were happening on the plane before thehijackers gained access to the cockpit. The FBI report to the media on this allegedconversation says that even as Sweeney was relating details about the hijackers toWoodward, the men were storming the front of the plane. I ask again: if all hellwas breaking lose in the plane and passengers were being attacked why no hijackcode from the cockpit and why wasn't the cockpit door immediately secured fromthe inside? According to Woodward, when the plane changed direction and beganto descend Sweeney called the cockpit, but there was no reply. Sweeney is said tohave told Woodward the seat numbers of the hijackers and that the plane wasgoing down. Her final words were given as: \"I see water and buildings. Oh myGod. Oh my God.\" American Airlines later released an account of a conversationit says took place during the flight between attendant Betty Ong and airlineofficials. They say that Ong pressed number 8 on a seatback GTE Airfone and gotthrough to an American Airlines reservations agent who called the systemoperations control centre in Fort Worth, Texas. The time was 8.27am, around 12minutes after the cockpit first failed to respond to air traffic instructions. CraigMarquis, the manager on duty, said that Betty Ong told him that two flightattendants had been stabbed and one was being given oxygen. A passenger hadbeen slashed in the throat and looked dead and the hijackers were in the cockpit.She said that the passengers had been sprayed with something that made her eyesburn and she was having difficulty breathing. She said there were four hijackers(again not the five the FBI claims) and she said they were in the first-class seats,2A, 2B, 9A, and 9B. These numbers were slightly different to those given by theother attendant, Madeline Amy Sweeney, and both were different to those givenby the FBI. I asked the FBI why there was such a discrepancy, but they said theycould not answer questions because of the \"ongoing investigation\" and I wouldhave to apply through the Freedom of Information Act in years to come to findthe information I wanted! (SeeAppendix Iand 2.) Betty Ong is claimed to havesaid that the wounded passenger was in seat 10B. Marquis asked Betty Ong if theplane was descending. \"We're starting to descend. We're starting to descend,\" sheis said to have replied. At 8.46am, 48 minutes after leaving Boston, Flight 11crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center at the 96th of the 110floors."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Problem-Reaction-Solution\t173The FBI later listed five hijackers on Flight 11, thus ignoring the fact that calls,apparently from two separate flight attendants actually on the flight, both said four.Iwill use the names and spellings from the indictment of Zacarias Moussaoui, whowas accused of involvement in the planning of the attacks. The indictment relates tohis appearance before the United States District Court for the Eastern District ofVirginia, Alexandria Division, in December 2001. Among those named by the FBI asa hijacker of Flight 11 was Mohamed Attaran Egyptian, who it says was at thecontrols when the plane struck the World Trade Center. The FBI also claims he wasthe overall leader of the 9/11 terrorists. The other hijackers on Flight 11 were namedon the indictment as Satam al-Suqami, from the United Arab Emirates, and AbdulAlomari, Wail al-Shehri, and Waleed al-Shehri, all from Saudi Arabia. Al-Suqami,the FBI tells us, was the only one of the five who was not a trained pilot.United Airlines flight 175Figure 11:The route of Flight 175Captain Victor J. Saracini, aged 51, and 38-year-old first officer Michael R. Horrockswere at the controls of Flight 175 when it pushed back from Gate 19 at Boston'sLogan Airport. This was seven gates along from Flight 11, which had left from Gate26 about 15 minutes earlier. The official stories of what happened to the two planesare very similar. Flight 175 took off about 8.14am and nothing seemed amiss in theinitial climb. At 8.37, with AA Flight 11 now known to be in trouble, a controller issaid to have asked Saracini and Horrocks if they could see American Flight 11ahead of them.Controller:\"Do you have traffic? Look at, uh, your twelve to one o'clock at about, uh,ten miles south bound to see if you can see an American seventy six seven out thereplease.\"UAL175:\"Affirmative we have him, uh, he looks, uh, about twenty yeah about twentynine, twenty eight thousand.\"Controller:\"United 175 turn five turn thirty degrees to the right I [want to] keep youaway from this traffic.\"5"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"174\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.We are then told there were no further communications between the groundand Flight 175 until 8.41, that's just five minutes before Flight 11 crashed into theWorld Trade Center. At this time one of the pilots on Flight 175 is claimed to havecalled the controller and said, using the pilot code for Boston: \"We heard asuspicious transmission on our departure from B-O-S. Sounds like someone keyedthe mike and said, 'Everyone stay in your seats'.\"' Again I asked the FederalAviation Administration for more information on this exchange, but they said theycould not comment. Just 90 seconds after that exchange between cockpit andcontroller, Flight 175 veered off-course over northern New Jersey and headedsouth before turning back in a U-turn towards New York at some 400 miles anhour, aiming for the World Trade Center.' That is just 90 seconds between noproblem and the plane being taken over by hijackers and flown off-course? Onceagain the transponder was switched off and there was no hijack code from thepilots, as with all four aircraft involved. Howard Dulmage, an aviation attorneyand pilot, said: \"You think four times in one morning one of those crews wouldhave done that. That means they had to be upon them before they could react.\"'Well that's one way of explaining it, anyway, but there are others. A female flightattendant is said to have spoken to a mechanic at an airline maintenance centre inSan Francisco that takes in-flight calls from attendants reporting items that needreplacing or repairing. The mechanic, we are told, reported the conversation about8.50am to Rich \"Doc\" Miles, the manager of the United Airlines System OperationsCenter in Chicago. He says the mechanic told him that the attendant had said: \"Ohmy God. The crew has been killed; a flight attendant has been stabbed. We've beenhijacked.\"9The line then went dead. If this is all true then, according to the officialtimeline, the hijackers stormed the cockpit, killed the crew, took over the controls, aflight attendant rang the airline mechanic, and he called Rich \"Doc\" Miles to reportwhat she said, all in the space of around seven minutes. Messages were sent to thecockpit computer without reply. Passenger Peter Hanson, a software salesman,apparently used his cellphone to ring his parents in Easton, Connecticut, at aboutgam, some 45 minutes after take-off, and said that hijackers with knives had takenover the plane and stabbed a stewardess. Soon after, he called again and before theline was lost he is said to have told his father Lee that the plane was \"goingdown\". Hanson's wife Sue, son Peter, and their two-year-old daughter Christinewere also on the plane. Around this time, it is claimed, an unidentified stewardessrang an emergency number from the back of the plane and described howcolleagues had been stabbed. At 9.03am Flight 175 smashed into the south towerof the World Trade Center on live television amid a fireball that no one who saw itwill ever forget.The FBI says the hijackers of Flight 175 were led by Marwan al-Shehhi of theUnited Arab Emirates, a close friend and associate of Mohamed Atta. FBIstatements claim that Al-Shehhi piloted the aircraft into the south tower. Also onthe plane, the FBI tells us, were Fayez Ahmed (also Banihammad Fayez) andMohald al-Shehri, both Saudis who had undergone flight training, and Ahmed al-Ghamdi and Hamza al-Ghamdi, also from Saudi Arabia."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Problem-Reaction-Solution\t175American Airlinesflight 77Figure 12: The USA Today version of the route of\tFigure 13: The other version of Flight 77 publishedFlight 77\telsewhere in the mediaIn the cockpit that morning as Flight 77 took off from Washington Dulles at 8.20amwere 51-year-old Captain Charles F. \"Chic\" Burlingame III and first officer DavidCharlebois, who was 39. Burlingame was a graduate of the \"Top Gun\" fighter pilotschool and was such a perfectionist that one colleague said that he would carry a setof small paint brushes to dust the instruments. He had once worked at the Pentagonwhile a Navy reservist not far from where his flight would crash that morning. Hisfather was in the Navy and Air Force for 23 years and he and his wife are buried inthe Arlington National Cemetery close to the Pentagon. Among the passengers wasa former American Airlines pilot called Wilson \"Bud\" Flagg, a retired NavyAdmiral once posted to the Pentagon; Brian Jack, a head of fiscal economics in theoffice of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld at the Pentagon, where he had workedfor 25 years; three engineers from plane makers, Boeing; and Barbara Olson, wife ofthe US Solicitor General, Theodore \"Ted\" Olson, and a contributor to CNN.Flight Explorer is a company that tracks commercial flights in real time usingdata provided by the Federal Aviation Administration, and can be accessed on theInternet.\" There are, however, two published versions of the route of Flight 77, bothsourced to Flight Explorer. The version published inUSA Today (Figure 12)includesa very strange \"loop\" deviation from its course as it turned north over WestVirginia, then west, before turning south and returning to its authorised route.\" Thisloop is not included in the course data published by other media organisations, andthis serious deviation happened well before the transponder was is said to havebeen turned off and the plane turned around to head back for Washington. If thisdid happen, what on earth were the air traffic controllers doing in that time andwhat was the reason given by the cockpit before the aircraft returned to its agreedroute? I asked the Federal Aviation Administration that very question, but itwouldn't comment. I contacted Flight Explorer to ask for confirmation that theUSATodayversion was correct and I was sent the route inFigure 13.About 8.50am we aretold that the cockpit stopped responding to controllers and six minutes later thetransponder was turned off. A controller is said to have called the aircraftrepeatedly asking: \"American 77 indy radio check, how do you read?\" At 9.02am,"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"176\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want.

Some reports say that a military C130(Golfer 06) took off from the Andrews Air Force Base near Washington to identifythe plane and reported it was a Boeing 767 (it was a 757) moving low and very fast.This was Flight 77, we are told, with the Pentagon as its target.It is said that one of the terrorists told the passengers that they were going to dieand they should phone their families. We are told that former federal prosecutorand CNN contributor Barbara Olson rang her husband, Ted Olson, US SolicitorGeneral, at his office in the Justice Department at about 9.25, according to mediareports. Olson says he was watching television coverage of the World Trade Centerwhen his secretary told him: \"Your wife is on the phone.\" Olson said that Barbara,his third wife, told him that her plane had been hijacked using box cutters andknives. She said nothing about the number of hijackers or their nationality.\" Thereappear to be several published versions of their conversation and in one she saidthe pilots were with her. Ted Olson told her about the World Trade Center and shesaid: \"What should I tell the pilot?\" before the line went down. Olson said he calledthe Justice Department command centre who told him they had no idea the planehad been hijacked. His wife rang back and said the plane was circling, but the linewas lost again, he said.\" Olson was the lawyer who argued the case before theSupreme Court for George W. Bush to be elected president after the Florida fiascoand has been a vehement advocate of Bush's anti-terrorism laws since September11th. On March 17th 2002, Ted Olson was defending the United States before theSupreme Court against charges of murder by the CIA. Olson said that day:\"It's easy to imagine an infinite number of situations where the government mightlegitimately give out false information. It's an unfortunate reality that the issuance ofincomplete information and even misinformation by government may sometimes beperceived as necessary to protect vital interests.\"By 9.42, some 80 minutes after take-off, Flight 77 was seen approachingWashington DC, it is claimed. The plane is said to have made a sharp turn anddescended very steeply from 7,000 feet to near surface level. It is reported to havecrossed a highway, clipping street lamps, before striking a helicopter pad andexploding into a five-storey section of the Pentagon, one of the world's biggestbuildings, at 9.43. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was in an office at theopposite end of the building to the impact and such is the size of the Pentagon hefelt only a \"jarring thing\". A total of 190 people died in the plane and the Pentagon,we are told. The FBI announced to the media that five hijackers were on boardFlight 77 led by Hani Hanjour. He had a commercial pilot's license and was said atfirst to have been at the controls when the plane struck the Pentagon until it wasclear from his flight instructors that he was a terrible pilot even in small planes. He"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Problem-Reaction-Solution\t177is a Saudi and so were the others named by the FBI as being on the plane. Theywere Majed Moqed, Salem al-Hamzi, Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaf al-Hamzi. Thelatter two were the only accused who appeared on the terrorist alert list.United Airlines flight 93Figure 14: The route of Flight 93Flight 93 left Gate 17 at Newark International Airport at 8.01am, bound for SanFrancisco, and took off at 8.42am after a long and unexplained delay. At the controlswere the 43-year-old captain Jason Dahl, from Littleton, Colorado, and the 36-year-old first officer LeRoy Homer of Marlton, New Jersey. They flew west overPennsylvania and into northern Ohio where they received a message from UnitedAirlines warning all pilots of a potential \"cockpit intrusion\". The cockpit of Flight93 confirmed receipt of the message and because of its late departure this was theonly one of the four planes that had prior warning of possible trouble. It is said thatFlight 93 was hijacked some 30 minutes after take off, that's around 9.10am, andafter the two planes had crashed into the World Trade Center. We are told it was9.16 when the Federal Aviation Administration told its military colleagues atNORAD that Flight 93 may have been hijacked, but the official story says that it wasnot until 9.40 that the transponder signal was lost. The hijackers are said to haveforced their way into the cockpit wearing red bandanas around their heads and oneof them warned he had a bomb attached to his waist. The official version says thehijackers told the passengers they were taking the plane to another airport. Airtraffic controllers apparently claim that they heard two short radio transmissionsaround the time the \"cockpit was stormed\" and in one they heard a pilot say: \"Getout of here\". An unnamed government official quoted in the media said there wereat least four radio transmissions in which the phrases \"bomb on board\", \"ourdemands\" and \"keep quiet\" were heard.\" A lot of these alleged conversationsremind me of a low-budget movie.ABC Newsclaimed to have secured a tape ofthese transmissions in which a hijacker says: \"We'd like you all to remain seated.There is a bomb on board.

At 9.45 ToddBeamer, a 32-year-old employee of the computer software company Oracle, is saidto have spoken to airphone supervisor Lisa Jefferson after his credit card wasrefused when he tried to call his family. A summary of the 15-minute conversationwas faxed by the Verizon phone company to his wife in which he said that the pilotand co-pilot appeared to be dead and the hijackers were flying the plane. Butanother passenger, Lauren Grandcolas, is reported to have phoned her husbandJack in San Francisco to say: \"We have been hijacked. They are being kind. I loveyou.\"\" Beamer is said to have stated that one hijacker was guarding 27 passengersat the back of the aircraft with what he was told was a bomb around his waist. He isreported to have said that two other hijackers were in the cockpit and another wasguarding first class. Beamer sent love to his wife, who was five months pregnant,and his two small sons. The last words the phone supervisor is said to have heardhim say were: \"Are you guy's ready? Let's roll.\"\" His wife Lisa, who never spoke tohim directly, said she recognised the phrase as one he used with their sons. Acontact that knows members of the Illuminati High Council in the United Statestold me that Verizon is a major Illuminati operation. At 9.42 Mark Bingham, a 31-year-old rugby player and an enormous man at six feet five, called his mother AliceHoglan from the plane. \"Mom, this is Mark Bingham,\" he said, sounding verynervous. \"I want to let you know that I love you. I'm calling from the plane. We'vebeen taken over. There are three men that say they have a bomb.\"19The FBI andBeamer said there were four. Jeremy Glick, a former national judo champion, talkedto his wife, Liz, on an airphone and asked if it was true about planes crashing intothe World Trade Center. He said the passengers were taking a vote over whetherthey should try to take back the plane. \"Honey, you need to do it,\" she told him.Glick's mother-in-law told CNN that he also called her and said that \"one of thehijackers had a red box he said was a bomb and one had a knife of some nature\".\"She said he asked her if reports about attacks on the World Trade Center were trueand she told him they were. He left the phone for a while, she said, returning to say:\"The men voted to attack the terrorists.\" Thomas Burnett Jr, a 38-year-old father ofthree girls, called from the plane four times and in his last call he told his wife thatthey planned to challenge the hijackers. \"I know we're all going to die,\" he told her,\"There's three of us who are going to do something about it. I love you, honey.\"\"Flight attendant Sandy Bradshaw called her husband Phil, a US Airways pilot.\"Have you heard what's going on?\" she said. \"My flight has been hijacked. Myflight has been hijacked with three guys with knives.\" Note again that the FBI saysfour, just as it names five for Flight 11 when the attendants were reported to havesaid four. Sandy said she was in the galley filling jugs with boiling water and sheended: \"Everyone's running to first class. I've got to go. Bye.\"22The official versionis that passengers attacked the hijackers and the plane smashed into a field atShanksville, Pennsylvania, at 575 miles an hour. The time given for the crash variesconsiderably. NORAD, the official military defenders of North American airspace,told me it happened at approximately 10.03, many other reports say 10.10, and still"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre DisasterProblem-Reaction-Solution\t179others 10.37. This last time is some two hours and 38 minutes after the first hijackedplane left Boston. By now thousands of people were dead and the world was intrauma at the unspeakable horror of what had happened. The FBI said the fourhijackers on Flight 93 were Saeed al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Haznawi, Ahmed al-Nami,and Ziad Jarrah.Television brought the shocking scenes to hundreds of millions of people as thenorth tower burned from the collision with Flight 11. Then, 18 minutes later, aspeople were watching those pictures, Flight 175 careered into the south tower amidan enormous explosion of flame. It is estimated that some 20,000 people could havebeen working in each of the towers at that time in the morning and the officialdeath toll was a little under three thousand. At 10am, less than an hour after theimpact from Flight 175, the south tower collapsed as a horrified world looked on.Half an hour later the north tower went the same way. The official explanation forthe imploding collapse was that the fuel fire had weakened steel supports and thefloors above the impact began to fall, creating an ever more powerful chain reactionas floors crashed upon floors until the whole building fell like some enormoushouse of cards. Among the dead were 341 fire fighters together with other rescuerswho had rushed into the buildings to help and been killed in the sudden collapse.The President and the pet goat storyPresident Bush was in Florida on the morning of September 11th for a long-standing photo opportunity at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School at Sarasota.The official story says that he began the day with a four and a half mile jog, twolaps of a golf course on Longboat Key.23There are inexplicably conflicting reports ofwhat Bush did that morning and when he knew about the first plane to strike theWorld Trade Center. I will go into these strange events in Sarasota in some detaillater.One of the official reports was that Bush was told about Flight 11 by his WhiteHouse Chief of Staff Andrew Card on the way to a classroom where he wasscheduled to promote his \"education\" policy.24The official tale is that Bush went toa private room and spoke on the phone with his National Security AdviserCondoleezza Rice. We are told that at this point the crash of Flight 11 could havebeen considered just a \"terrible accident\", but this is a lie, as we shall see. Afterhearing about Flight 11 crashing into the north tower of the World Trade Center,President Bush acted decisively. He went into the classroom to hear childrenreading a story about a pet goat. Bush entered the classroom at about gam withEducation Secretary Ron Paige and Florida Lieutenant Governor Frank Brogan.They paused for media photographs and Bush sat down in front of the 18 childrenfrom the second grade. As the children read to him he said: \"Really good readers -whew!\" Bush interrupted at one point, saying, \"This must be Sixth Grade.\"25This isa guy who has just been told that a commercial airliner has smashed into one of thetwo biggest buildings in America in the heart of downtown New York. Chief ofStaff Andrew Card then appeared in the classroom and whispered into Bush's earto tell him about the crash of the second plane, Flight 175. This was the picture seenall over the world along with headlines like: \"The Moment Bush Knew\". Yet still he"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"180\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.stayed in the classroom listening to children reading about a pet goat. It was onlyaround 9.30 - 26minutesafter hearing of the second crash and some 45 after the first- that Bush reacted. He went into the school library to announce:\"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America. Two airplanes havecrashed into the World Trade Center in an apparent terrorist attack on our country. I amgoing to conduct a full-scale investigation and hunt down and find those folks whocommitted this act. Terrorism against our nation will not stand.\"26Those folks?Those folks?Bush's behaviour that morning was, at the very least,criminally inept and incompetent, but it was more than that, as I shall highlightlater. Bush was taken to the presidential plane, Air Force One, and it was naturallybelieved that he would head for Washington at this time of terror and chaos for hiscountry. Instead he embarked on a day-long tour of the skies that included stops atBarksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, and the US Strategic Command at Offutt AirForce base in Nebraska. He did not arrive in Washington until 7pm - ten hours afterAndrew Card walked into the classroom and told him of the second crash. Even theofficial story says that Bush did not call Vice President Cheney to put the USmilitary on high alert status until 10 o'clock that morning when he was in Air ForceOne. Between 9.05am when he was told of the second crash in New York and themoment when he picked up the phone to put the US military on high alert status anastonishing55minuteshad elapsed. It was in this period that Flight 77 crashed intoan unprotected Pentagon. When understandable questions were being asked aboutBush's unexplained dash to Louisiana and on to Nebraska after his nation hadsuffered such a massive terrorist attack, White House spokespeople said that theyhad received a phone call giving a secret code to say that Air Force One was thenext target. Like most of the 9/11 story this turned out to be a solid gold lie andlater had to be admitted as such.I have seen reports that Father George Bush was in the White House with Cheneywhile the attacks were happening27and an Air Force source also said that this wastrue. These reports say that Bush left Washington by private jet at 10am that morningwhile other air traffic was being grounded. This is not that far from the official story,which says that he and wife Barbara were at the White House the night before andflew out of Washington on the morning of 9/11. Father Bush told CNN that theywere flying to St. Paul, Minneapolis, when the first news was flashed to their SecretService detail about the attacks. Their plane was diverted to Milwaukee, Wisconsin,and they were taken to a motel beyond the city limits where they could only followevents on television like everyone else, it is claimed.\" If Father George Bush was notactively involved in events then I have a seafront home in the Gobi Desert.Herr Blair hears the newsFrom the start, President Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair were singing, asalways, from the same song sheet. Blair was in Brighton on the south coast ofEngland when the World Trade Center was struck. He was due to make what was"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre DisasterProblem-Reaction-Solution\t181going to be a difficult and less than well-received speech to trades unionists, but thiswas cancelled and he headed back by train for London. According to media reports,Blair called his Foreign and Defence Secretaries, Jack Straw and Geoff Hoon. Thethree agreed, the reports say, to build \"... an international alliance which includedthe rest of Europe, Muslim nations, China and Russia.\"29But why would Blair andhis yes-men do this immediately after the American attacks when they should havehad no idea who was behind them according to the CIA and FBI? Not even theAmericans had officially mentioned any suspects at that stage. We are talking ofactions taken immediately after the attacks and Blair is already preparing for whatbecame known as the \"war on terrorism\". Back in London, Blair told a newsconference that Britain would stand \"shoulder to shoulder\" with the United States.This was, in effect, a blank cheque speech, as events were to confirm. In the hoursand days that followed, the culprit or \"patsy\" was already being dusted down -Osama bin Laden. His name would be repeated like a mantra by Bush, Powell andBlair until he became guilty, not by evidence, but by constant repetition. During hissummer holiday a month before 9 / 11 Blair had read security reports on Osama binLaden and Islamic fundamentalism, and read parts of the Koran to \"... try andunderstand aspects of the faith and fathom out whether a justification for terrorismcould really be found, as often argued, in its pages\".\" What a coincidence.Once upon a time in fairyland ...The television networks were naming Osama bin Laden as the likely culprit in thehours after the planes struck the World Trade Center and Colin Powell, theSecretary of State, first mentioned that Osama bin Laden was a \"prime suspect\" twodays after 9/11. Powell told the media: \"We are looking at those terroristorganisations who have the kind of capacity to conduct the kind of attack that wesaw.\" Really? Did he mean the CIA and the Pentagon? No, as it turns out. Askedwhether he was referring to Osama bin Laden, he answered: \"Yes.\" Once binLaden's name was in the ring, the \"evidence\" began to emerge in support of thetheory that the attack was carried out by extreme Islamic fundamentalists. Anofficial \"investigation\" was launched by two Bush family gofers: Attorney GeneralJohn Ashcroft and the two-weeks-in-the-job FBI chief, Robert Mueller. The FBIimmediately named 19 Arab men as responsible for the hijackings. This wasremarkable in itself because this same agency, along with the CIA, had told us it didnot have even a glimmer of an idea that the biggest terrorist attack in Americanhistory was being put together for months before September 11th and, in Mueller'swords, almost certainly years. But now the names and pictures of those involvedwere suddenly produced. What fantastic detective work! The problem was, as weshall discuss later, that more than a third of the names on the FBI \"hijacker\" listwere found to be still alive! Maybe they parachuted just before impact? Anythingbecomes possible when the official story needs propping up.The \"biggest investigation in American history\" with 4,000 officers and 3,000support personnel apparently deployed by the FBI alone was helped by somestaggering good fortune. This included the fact that the bag of \"mastermind\""},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"182\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.Mohamed Atta failed to make it on to Flight 11 and this presented the FBI with\"incriminating evidence\" together with the contents of abandoned hire cars inairport car parks. The FBI said it found a Saudi passport, an international driver'slicense, a copy of the Koran, \"some kind of religious tape\", and, yes, yes, avideotape on how to fly Boeing 757s and 747s.31What a piece of luck. But even thiswas eclipsed by the miraculous find, widely reported in the media, of a passportfrom one of the hijackers that was discovered in the street a few blocks from theWorld Trade Center. Somehow, while some two thousand bodies have never beenfound, a paper passport that had been in the pocket or bag of a hijacker hadsurvived the impact of a commercial airliner at some 400 miles an hour and thefireball that followed. It had fallen from the plane and wafted down to be found,still recognisable and identifiable, in the street. If that is possible, maybe the still-alive hijackers did parachute after all. We were also told, again despite twothousand bodies disappearing without trace, that a stewardess with her hands tiedbehind her back was discovered soon after the attacks - just as the official story wasbeing heavily promoted.\"The ReactionThese miracle finds and the constant repetition of the official story served to supportthe script to which Bush, Blair and their \"teams\" were all working. Arab hijackershad stormed the cockpits, the trained pilots among them had taken over the controls,and the planes were deliberately aimed at their targets in a mass suicide and murderattack on America. What's more, the hijackers were working for Osama bin Ladenwho was based in Afghanistan and protected by the Taliban regime. Once this coverstory was established immediately after September 11th nothing was allowed tochallenge its supremacy. This is how it was and this is how it is. End of story. If youquestion anything we tell you then clearly you are supporting terrorism. Or, as Bushput it: \"You are either with us or against us.\" (Roughly translated that means: \"Youeither don't have a brain or you do.\") This was the story parroted hour after hour,week after week, by the mainstream media across the world. The media is amegaphone for the official version of events. Official sources tell the media whathappened and the media repeat this slavishly and call it \"news\". The BBC and itslike, for example, reported the \"hijacker passport\" story without any reference to thefact that it was clearly ridiculous. No, really, the FBI told us, so it must be true.Timothy Lee Harvey bin LadenColin Powell attended a meeting of the National Security Council at the WhiteHouse after 9 / 11 and it was agreed that he, Bush and deputy Secretary of StateRichard Armitage would work to build an \"international consensus\" againstterrorism.What a trio to lead the world in a moral crusade against those whopursue crimes against humanity! Pinch me, please. The message was: Osama binLaden is the Mr Big behind 9 / 11 and as the Taliban are protecting him inAfghanistan they would have to be removed as well if they did not hand him over."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre DisasterProblem-Reaction-Solution\t183By Tony Blair's own admission, no evidence whatsoever was produced that wouldhave stood the test of a courtroom. But that mattered not. Bush, Blair, and theirhandlers and henchmen had decided that was the story and that was the end of it.When the Taliban asked for evidence against bin Laden before handing him over,Bush replied: \"They are harbouring a terrorist and they need to hand him over.There's no need to discuss innocence or guilt. We know he's guilty.\"33What aperfect summary of the arrogant dictatorship that runs America and the widerworld. Don't do as I do, do as I say. Powell and Blair embarked on their \"whirlwinddiplomacy\" to gather support for the Anglo-American \"war on terrorism\". This\"diplomacy\", as usual, involved telling their hosts around the world about theconsequences for them and their countries of not doing what was demanded.Powell publicly warned Pakistan: \"... as we gather information and as we look atpossible sources of the attack, it would be useful to point out to the Pakistanileadership at every level that we are looking for and expecting their fullestcooperation and their help and support\".'Pakistan President General PervezMusharraf knew the score and Pakistan's military dictatorship, with a horrendousrecord of supporting terrorist groups, joined the \"war on terrorism\". This involvedhanding over decision-making to Bush, Powell and the rest of Americangovernment mafia, but then that was no problem for the Pakistan authorities andtheir intelligence network because that is a branch of the CIA anyway. Musharraf\"won\" five more years in office in a \"referendum\" in late April 2002, which wasdescribed by the Human Rights Commission in Pakistan as a \"humiliating fraud\".35Obviously they moved the gang in from Florida to ensure the right result.Terrorists \"fight\" terrorismThe criteria for joining the anti-terrorism \"coalition\" was not your record ofsupporting terrorism because on that basis the United States and Britain wouldhave been denied membership before anyone. No, the criteria was: will you dowhat the United States and Britain tell you to do? If yes, you're in and againstterrorism; if no, you are a supporter of terrorism. These guys really are the bullies ofthe world. They had the nerve to wheel out the \"first ladies\", Laura Bush andCherie Blair, within 24 hours of each other to condemn the Taliban for theirtreatment of women. Yes, the Taliban's sick ideology was horrible, but not a wordwas said about the appalling treatment of women by Saudi Arabia, where I livedfor some months in the late 1970s. The difference between the condemnation of theTaliban and the silence about Saudi Arabia was simply that the Taliban was thetarget to be demonised to justify the invasion of Afghanistan while the Saudis whojoined the \"war on terrorism\" are an arm of the United States and the Carlyle Groupof Daddy Bush, Baker and Carlucci. This is the peace-loving, justice-supporting,Saudi Arabia that is the home of Osama bin Laden and much of his funding; theSaudi Arabia that conducts a terrorist war against its own people to keep thetyrants and hypocrites in the Saudi \"royal\" family in power as poodles of the USgovernment; and the Saudi Arabia that continues to chop off people's heads andhands according to their Nazi religious \"law\". Saudi Arabia is controlled by a"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"184\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.deeply disturbed terrorist regime - the \"royal\" dictatorship - and hypocrisy rules,OK? This becomes even more blatant when you consider that it was Saudi and USsupport that underpinned the Taliban. Who are the \"advisers\" to the Saudi royalfamily? Father George's Carlyle Group. Who are very close to the \"royal\" House ofSaud? The bin Laden family. Who owned the National Commercial Bank the Saudiroyal family uses to conduct its business affairs? Khalid bin Mahfouz, funder ofBush family businesses, 20% shareholder in the BCCI, and named by the USgovernment as a funder of Osama bin Laden. Who controls that bank now?Mohammed Hussein Al-Amoudi, a close business associate of bin Mahfouz, andanother man named as a funder of Osama bin Laden's network. What was the banknamed by the US government as a source of the funding for bin Laden? TheNational Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia. Who were part of the consortium withUnocal to build the pipelines across Afghanistan? Delta (Al-Amoudi) and Nimir(bin Mahfouz). No wonder Saudi Arabia was considered one of the good guys byBush and Blair while the Taliban were condemned and bombed into oblivion. Ithink, however, that demonising Saudi Arabia to advance the agenda may be partof the plan also sometime in the future. Everyone and everything is expendable tothese people when it suits the agenda.Secretary of State Colin Powell, reading from the script, pledged \"to make surethat we go after terrorism and get it by its branch and root\".' That did not, ofcourse, include his own involvement in terrorist activity on behalf of the UnitedStates government or anyone who took orders from that government. Sanctionsagainst Pakistan in response to its nuclear weapons programme were removed byPresident Bush when the Pakistani leadership agreed to play ball. Funny howPakistan and India having nuclear weapons was so dangerous that sanctions wereimposed, but suddenly, when they agreed to follow orders from Bush and hismasters after 9/11, that \"nuclear threat\" immediately diminished. The next thingyou know they are both threatening to use them against each other. But whatarrogance to say that the US and Britain can have nuclear weapons by right, but anylesser political and economic power must not. NATO and the United Nations alsoplayed their parts in the 9/11 movie. The UN Security Council has only fivepermanent members - the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia. Thesefive have the power of veto over \"substantive issues\". The Security Council has, intruth, been dominated by Britain and America, so naturally it would follow theparty line after September 11th with a call for \"all necessary means\" to be used toovercome the threat of terrorism. NATO rolled over and purred, not least becausethe NATO Secretary General was Lord Robertson, a close associate of Tony Blairand his former Secretary of Defence. Like Blair, Robertson attends meetings of theIlluminati's Bilderberg Group and was invited to the one at Turnberry in Scotlandshortly before being named Secretary General of NATO in 1999. The last six headsof NATO have been from the Bilderberg Group. The day after September 11th, the19-member NATO Council, \"encouraged\" by Robertson, invoked for the first timeArticle Five of its founding charter. This says that an attack on one member is anattack on all of them. Clearly copies of the script had been widely distributed."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre DisasterProblem-Reaction-Solution\t185Puppet parliamentsBoth Houses of Congress authorised Bush to \"use all necessary and appropriateforce\" against those responsible, including any nations supporting them, and the UKparliament gave Blair similar unquestioned backing to do the same (when he evenbothered to ask). This meant that within days of the attacks the Bush-Blair Illuminati-serving Axis of Evil (the real one) had all it needed to wage a war that had been yearsin the planning. While both the US and UK governments had long failed the poor,homeless, and deprived through a \"lack of money to do everything we would like\",suddenly, as with all wars, money was no object. Funny how there is a shortage ofmoney to keep people alive and help them achieve a decent quality of life, but there isnever a shortage of funds to spend on killing and maiming them. There is a simplereason for this: when there is something the Illuminati want to happen to advancetheir agenda, the Illuminati produce the funds to make happen. Congressimmediately sanctioned $40 billion for the \"war on terrorism\" and within monthsBush announced a $48 billion increase in defence spending to \"fight the war onterror\". This was an increase of almost 15%, the biggest in 20 years, and it brought U.Smilitary spending to $379billion.The money has been assigned, so we are told, tosalary increases for military personnel (dictators always look after their soldiers) andthe latest precision weapons, missile defences, unmanned vehicles and high-techequipment for ground troops. A large chunk will also go to \"homeland defence\"(control of the people) and Bush called for the hiring of 30,000 airport securityworkers and an extra 300 FBI agents - an FBI which, with 4,000 operatives already,did not, we are told officially, have the slightest clue that the biggest terrorist attack inhistory had been in the planning for years. The CIA budget is also due to increase byan estimated $1.5 billion or $2 billion by 2003, although we can't know the true figurebecause the CIA budget is classified.37\"I have a responsibility to prepare the nationfor all that lies ahead,\" Bush said. He was right, too. A responsibility to the Illuminatihierarchy to prepare the nation for what they have already planned will lie ahead.Forever John WaynePresident Bush, like Reagan and all American leaders, has a massive built-inadvantage in his pursuit of a dictatorship at home and mass murder abroad. It is thecollective mind of America. Individually Americans are overwhelmingly wonderfulpeople and a joy to know and be with. They are almost always helpful, kind, andfriendly. But the collective mind, the national mind if you like, can be barely one-dimensional when it falls for the manipulations of its government. There is a part ofthe American collective psyche that is forever John Wayne. It sees only good guysand bad guys, cowboys and Indians, black and white. Many Americans (though it ischanging) see the world in these terms and their access to foreign news and eventsis so sparse and slanted in the US media that they have virtually no idea what ishappening beyond the American borders, or even inside them come to that. Insteadthey let their leaders tell them what is happening and they are sold a fantasy basedon the cliched script of a movie starring John Wayne or Sylvester Stallone.

Bush's speechwriters targeted exactly this responseafter 9/11 by providing quotes like: \"I can hear you and the rest of the world hearsyou and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.\"Get on yer horse Big Jaaahn. This planet ain't big enough for the both of us. TheRambo response - no subtleties, no shades of grey, shoot first and ask no questions- is used to manipulate the emotions of the American psyche and to activate machoman and macho woman. Mainstream radio talk show hosts are classic expressionsof this with their mindless calls to \"nuke 'em\" whenever the bullies in governmentpick yet another fight with a country that has no means of credible defence. Amongthe public responses quoted in the media in the aftermath of September 11th wasthat of Joan Renshaw, a grandmother in Atlanta: \"I'm angry. I'm hoping we wipethese people out, and if we need to, wipe out the country that is hosting them. Justget rid of them all.\"' Then there was Phil Beckwith, a former Navy Chief PettyOfficer from Wyoming: \"I know just what to do with these Arab people. We have tofind them, kill them, wrap them in pigskin and bury them. That way they will nevergo to heaven. Bury Osama bin Laden with a pigskin, donate blood for the people inNew York and God bless this great country.\"39We have the same collectivementality in Britain, although there appears to be a much greater outbreak ofscepticism here among the general public. Calls in America and elsewhere for apeaceful response to September 11th were lost in the clamour and lust for revenge.One banner encapsulated the situation when it said, \"An Eye for An Eye Makes theWorld Blind\". But such sentiments were dismissed as weak and cowardly, or even,as support for the terrorists. Add all these political and public responses togetherand it meant only one thing: thousands of civilians in Afghanistan who had neverseen Osama bin Laden, including children who had never even heard of him, werenow doomed to die from bombs dropped on their already devastated settlementsby the forces of \"freedom\" and \"justice\".The Solution\"War\" with AfghanistanAs in Iraq, the \"real men\" of the American and British Air Forces bravely flew outof range of the ancient technology that passed for the Afghanistan air defenceswhile dropping state-of-the-art bombs and missiles on civilians.

Theycalled it the worst terrorist attack in history. Yet a study by Professor Marc Herold ofthe University of New Hampshire concluded that between October 7th andDecember 7th 2001 at least 3,800 Afghanistan civilians (men, women, and childrenwith no connection whatsoever to 9/11) died from American and British attacks.This figure was a \"very, very conservative estimate,\" Professor Herold said. \"I thinkthat a much more realistic figure would be around 5,000,\" he suggested, \"You knowfor Afghanistan, 3,700 to 5,000 is a really substantial number.\"41Professor Herold'sfigures were based only on deaths reported in the mainstream media and did notinclude those in remote areas of Afghanistan and those unreported in the press (Godonly knows how many that would be). Nor does the figure include those who diedbecause the air strikes prevented their access to hospitals, food or electricity, or thosewho were injured and died later. Add together all of the Afghan civilians who diedas a result of the US-British bombardment and you will have a figure of many, many,thousands more than those who died on September 11th. If 9/11 was the \"worstterrorist act in history\" what does that make the attacks on civilians in Afghanistan,never mind Iraq? They said that what happened in America was \"evil\" and thenresponded by killing even more civilians in a far-away country. In the newspeak ofthe Illuminati they called this mass murder of the innocent \"Operation InfiniteJustice\" and then \"Operation Enduring Freedom\".

Theyflew to Kabul to meet Afghans who lost members of their own families in the Bush-Blair bombing.

Whether the dead are Americans or Afghans or Iraqis makesno difference to the Illuminati. They see them as the same cattle, the same cannonfodder, on the road to global control. One of the few news reports to tell any truthabout the calculated attacks on Afghan civilians was written by Catherine Philip intheWeekend Australianof November 3rd-4th 2001. Filing from Quetta in Pakistan,she told a chilling story of what so many Afghan villagers experienced. Under theheadline \"Massacre in the Moonlight - Alarm of a Different Kind\", she reported:\"When Zamina Ahmed was awakened by the warplanes roaring overhead and heard thedeafening boom of a bomb dropping close by, her first thought was to get out of thehouse. Grabbing her son, Sabir, 5, she ran into the courtyard of the sprawling familycompound, searching for a safe place to hide.\"Behind her in the house, her daughter, Shaida, 14, cowered in her bed, too terrified torun. As the door banged shut, she heard the deafening rattle of gunfire from the sky.She looked out of the glassless window in time to see her mother slump lifeless to theground. 'The moon was shining and in the light, I saw her fall to the ground with Sabirstill in her arms,' Shaida said. 'I knew she had been shot'.\"Naseer Mohammed, 20, and his niece, Najia, 14, had nearly made it out of thecompound when the bullets started raining down. One bullet caught Najia squarely inthe chest, killing her instantly. Mr Mohammed ran on to find cover, leaving her bodysprawled on the dusty ground.\"Hiding in the entrance to a nearby cave, he watched as the gunships - believed to beAmerican AC130s, deployed to hunt down and kill Taliban forces and terrorists from theal-Qaeda network - circled over the village firing repeatedly at the people as they fledtheir homes.\"'When they dropped the first bomb, everyone ran out and then they began firing on thepeople,' Mr Mohammed said. 'I was very frightened and confused. I wondered why arethey doing this to us.' The attack lasted an hour. By the time it was over, 18 membersof the family were dead, five of them children. All were killed by gunfire after they raninto the open.\"'Just because I hid in a room, I am alive,' Shaida said. 'Those who ran into the yardwere killed.' Survivors arriving across the border in Quetta, Pakistan, say as many as17 other civilians died in the attack on Chowkar Karez village on the evening of October"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Problem-Reaction-Solution\t18922, bringing the total of dead to 35. The accounts they give of the attack are strikinglyconsistent. Without exception, they say the first bomb was dropped around 11pm, thatmost people immediately ran outside in fear and were then mown down by gunfire fromthe circling gunships. 'They were huge planes,' Mr Mohammed said. 'If the Taliban andOsama bin Laden are the targets then why were they shooting at us?'\"Whatever happened in Chowkar Karez, it does not appear to be a simple case of abomb going astray. The gunners who strafed the village clearly believed that there wassomething there that they had to destroy. On the night of October 23, the day after thefirst attack, the planes returned, circling overhead and firing into the houses. Thattime, the people stayed inside. In the morning, they left. None of the villagers seemsure if they would return. For those who survived, the wounds go as deep asshrapnel.\"43This is just another every-day story of America and Britain making war onterrorism. It was Iraq revisited with many more like it destined to come until thepeople of this world emerge from their comatose state. Andrew Gumbel, writing inthe UKIndependentof November 3rd, also reported the massacre of Chowkar Karez.He wrote that \"Western journalists and human rights organisations published theclearest evidence yet of mass civilian casualties caused by the American bombingcampaign yesterday\". He went on:\"Visiting journalists counted 18 fresh graves but were told the villagers had not beenable to sort out the many severed limbs and body parts to give each person their ownfinal resting place. 'As we buried the dead, the planes came again,' said an old farmercalled Mangal, who claimed to have lost 30 relatives including 12 women and 14children. 'We had to work quickly. Not everyone got their own grave' ...\"44The Pentagon confirmed that an AC-130 Spectre gunship attacked the village(several were involved, not only one, the villagers said), but a spokesman claimed itwas a \"legitimate target\". However, anything is deemed a legitimate target to thesedisturbed people. \"There was a positively identified Taliban encampment, whichincluded al-Qa'ida collaborators, in the vicinity of Chowkar that was struck inOctober,\" a Pentagon parrot told theWashington Post.\"The encampment was fullydeveloped and was a legitimate military target under the law of armed conflict.\"45The same law, I take it, that says that those who defend themselves against suchattacks from a foreign aggressor cannot be called prisoners of war because theyweren't wearing uniforms. In other words, America's law, Britain's law, Illuminatilaw, which constantly changes to fit the moment and has no regard for life.Intellectual prostitutesThe reports of Afghan casualties and the targeting of civilians I have featured hereare rare because of the media management orchestrated through the political andmilitary network and the Illuminati-owned media like CNN, a subsidiary of AOL-"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"190\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want.

The New York-based organisation called FAIR (Fairness and Accuracyin Reporting)46highlighted the extraordinary comments by Walter Isaacson, thechairman of CNN or, as I call it, Claptrap No News or the Criminal News Network.As reported by theWashington Post,\"Isaacson \" ... ordered his staff to balanceimages of civilian devastation in Afghan cities with reminders that the Talibanharbors murderous terrorists, saying it 'seems perverse to focus too much on thecasualties or hardship in Afghanistan'.\" Isaacson had the nerve to tell theWashington Post: \"Iwant to make sure we're not used as a propaganda platform.\"\"No kidding. These guys have no shame. Howard Kurtz, thePost'smedia reporter,quoted a memo from Isaacson to CNN's international correspondents thatadmonished reporters covering civilian deaths not to \"forget it is that country'sleaders who are responsible for the situation Afghanistan is now in\". He suggestedthat journalists should put the responsibility for civilian deaths with the Taliban, notthe American military. Kurtz also quoted a memo from Rick Davis, CNN's head of\"standards\" and practices, which recommended the following sample commentsfor news presenters to say after reports of Afghan civilian casualties:\"We must keep in mind, after seeing reports like this from Taliban-controlled areas, thatthese US military actions are in response to a terrorist attack that killed close to 5,000innocent people in the US' or, 'We must keep in mind, after seeing reports like this, thatthe Taliban regime in Afghanistan continues to harbor terrorists who have praised theSeptember 11 attacks that killed close to 5,000 innocent people in the US' or 'ThePentagon has repeatedly stressed that it is trying to minimize civilian casualties inAfghanistan, even as the Taliban regime continues to harbor terrorists who are connectedto the September 11 attacks that claimed thousands of innocent lives in the US\"'49Davis added that \"even though it may start sounding rote, it is important thatwe make this point each time\". During its US broadcasts CNN \"quickly switched tothe rubble of the World Trade Center\" after showing images of the damage inKandahar and the news anchor \"reminded viewers of the deaths of as many as5,000 people whose biggest crime was going to work and getting there on time\".s°So what was the biggest crime of Afghan children then? Appalling as CNN may be,this outrageous manipulation of news can be found all over the world. TheNewYork Timesreported that such policies were being implemented at other televisionnetworks. \"In the United States television images of Afghan bombing victims arefleeting, cushioned between anchors or American officials explaining that suchsights are only one side of the story\", theNew York Timessaid.\"While themainstream media spews out the official story of 9 / 11 those who question or exposeit are virtually denied access.

The same has happened to mewhen presenters and reporters have asked me to appear and then the invitation iswithdrawn close to airtime accompanied by one of those \"Er, urn, er,\" stuttering\"explanations\" that insult the intelligence.How does anyone believe the media is going to tell us the truth when the veryforces that are desperate to deny us the truth own the press and broadcasting? Thethree major US television networks, CBS, NBC and ABC, are an excellent case inpoint. The giant Westinghouse owns CBS, and NBC is controlled by General Electric.These are both companies that make a fortune from wars and the Illuminati agendaas a whole. In 1996 Disney bought ABC. This has been an Illuminati operation sinceMickey Mouse and is constantly named in relation to mind-control programmes (seeThe Biggest Secret).The \"Watergate\" journalist Carl Bernstein has written thathundreds of prominent US media owners and journalists have knowingly worked forthe CIA, including William Paley of CBS, Arthur Sulzberger of theNew York Times,Henry Luce ofTime-Life,William Buckley of theNational Review,and Ben Bradlee oftheWashington Post.52Journalist Deborah Davis also reveals the CIA-media connectionin her book,Katherine the Great,an investigation into the long-time publisher of theWashington Post,the late Katherine Graham.\" The book was apparently \"pulled frombookstores and pulped\" after objections from Graham, but Davis took her publishersto court for censorship and won. It was republished with Sheridan Square Press in1991.5'Davis writes that by the 1950s the CIA \"owned respected members of theNewYork Times, Newsweek,CBS, and other communications vehicles, plus at least four tosix hundred reporters, according to a CIA analyst.\"55What must it be today? AsRobert Lederman, a New York writer, artist and campaigner, put it: \"The media is notinfluenced by the CIA - the media is the CIA.\"51A man behind this media takeoverwas Frank Wisner, who orchestrated Project Paperclip, the CIA operation thatarranged for a long list of Nazis to escape from Germany at the end of the war tocontinue their work for the Illuminati in the United States, South America andelsewhere. If the media is telling you something it is because that is what theauthorities want you to believe. As someone once said in a television drama: \"A liecan go around the world before the truth has got its boots on.\" This is possiblebecause of media owners like Katherine Graham, publisher of theWashington Postand a member of the Illuminati's Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations andTrilateral Commission. She said in a speech at CIA headquarters in 1988:\"We live in a dirty and dangerous world. There are some things the general public doesnot need to know and shouldn't. I believe democracy flourishes when the governmentcan take legitimate steps to keep its secrets, and when the press can decide whetherto print what it knows.\"57This is the mentality that is telling you what happened on September 11th, whowas responsible, and what should happen as a result. These are also the people whoare \"reporting\" the wars and giving you the government propaganda to justifythem. Comforting, isn't it?"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"192\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.Bye, bye freedomAcross the world, the deaths of those 3,000 Americans and citizens of 80 nationshave been used to promote the destruction of basic freedoms. Even when I was inNew Zealand two months after 9/11 they were proposing new \"anti-terrorism\"laws to \"protect the public\". How on earth anyone in New Zealand is in any moredanger now than they were on September 10th 2001 would defeat anyone with amodicum of intelligence. Enough to move your eyelids would be sufficient to seewhat a nonsense that is. But common sense is not the motivation here. The aim andthe game is for the Illuminati to activate its operatives and unthinking stooges touse the excuse of the World Trade Center disaster to further imprison the humancattle. Gary Hart of the Council on Foreign Relations talked of \"a continuing tradeoff between security and liberty and freedom going forward into the 21stcentury\".58US Attorney General John Ashcroft set about his task with undisguisedrelish, and the dismantling of freedoms and the increase in governmentsurveillance has been introduced with what the American Civil Liberties Unioncalls \"dizzying speed\".59Ashcroft and the Bush administration rushed through the\"USA Patriot Act\" in response to the 9/11 attacks and I have no doubt it wasalready drafted well before those planes took off from Boston airport. In fact JamesX. Dempsey and David Cole reveal in their book,Terrorism and the Constitution:Sacrificing Civil Liberties in the Name of National Security,60that the most extremeelements of the \"anti-terrorism\" laws introduced after Oklahoma and September11th were developed \"long before the bombings that triggered their finalenactment.\" Dempsey is a former assistant counsel to the House JudiciarySubcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, and Cole is a professor of law atGeorgetown University and an attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights.They document how it was the Reagan-Bush and Bush-Quayle administrationsthat first proposed some of the \"most troubling provisions\" that were to becomelaw after Oklahoma and September 11th, but Congress had rejected them asunconstitutional. These included giving power to the Secretary of State todesignate groups as terrorist organisations without judicial or congressionalreview. But then came the Oklahoma bombing and attitudes began to change aspeople like Senator Orrin Hatch from Mormon Utah aggressively supported theintroduction of the Bush proposals. Hatch is the man who dismissed anysuggestion that the authorities were responsible for Waco; who took money fromRumsfeld's Searle pharmaceuticals to support aspartame; who made stirringspeeches in support of the BCCI; who called those who questioned the \"anti-terrorism\" laws after 9/11 as nothing more than \"Senate egos\"; who told the mediaimmediately after the September 11th attacks that Osama bin Laden was the likelysuspect. Nice man. \"Senator Hatch wanted to make it more difficult for federalcourts to order retrials of prisoners where state courts had violated the USConstitution\", according to Dempsey and Cole. In the wake of Oklahoma thedismantling of basic freedoms first proposed by Father George Bush became lawand even more so after September 11th. A coincidence? Not a chance."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Problem-Reaction-Solution\t193As I mentioned earlier, whenever the Illuminati use words the real meaning isthe very opposite of how they are presented. For example, the control of the worldeconomy by a few global corporations owned by the same people is called \"freetrade\" and a dictatorship is called a democracy or a \"democratic front\". In this case,removing the very freedoms on which the United States claims to have beenfounded is called an act of patriotism or a \"USA Patriot Act\", a term that derivesfrom the very deliberate naming of the legislation as \"Uniting and StrengtheningAmerica by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and ObstructTerrorism Act\". The government demonises \"patriots\" and \"patriotism\" when theAmerican Patriot movement challenges the tyranny of government and the globalconspiracy, but \"patriotism\" is promoted when it means doing whatever thegovernment tells you. This is an old, old, trick. Theodore Roosevelt definedpatriotism in far more sensible and mature terms. He said:\"Patriotism means to stand by the country. It does not mean to stand by the presidentor any other public official, save exactly to the degree in which he himself stands by thecountry. It is patriotic to support him insofar as he efficiently serves the country. It isunpatriotic not to oppose him to the exact extent that by inefficiently or otherwise hefails in his duty to stand by the country. In either event, it is unpatriotic not to tell thetruth, whether about the president or anyone else.\"As Samuel Johnson said: \"Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.\" ThePatriot Act, and other legislation and presidential decrees, have basically giventhose that control the American government the legal right to do whatever theylike.Many of these new \"laws\" have been implemented through a scamintroduced by the Boy George administration called the \"emergency rule-makingauthority\", which exempts the Attorney General from respecting the normalnotice and comment period for such changes. Crucially for Americans, thedefinition of a terrorist in the Patriot Act is designed to apply to them also. The actdefines terrorism as activities that \"involve acts dangerous to human life that area violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State; or appear tobe intended 'to intimidate or coerce a civilian population' and \"to influence thepolicy of a government by intimidation or coercion\". That could be defined asalmost anything, including legitimate peaceful protest. President Bush issued a\"Military Order\" on November 13th 2001 that makes legal the potentiallyindefinite detention of any \"non-citizen\" accused of terrorism, and permits the\"trial\" of such defendants by a secret military commission with no provision forjudicial review.\" The person can therefore be chosen by the President to go beforea secret tribunal, which can \"try\", convict and sentence him, including imposingthe death sentence, without making any of its evidence or the defence caseavailable to the public. Indeed the public would not have to be told the tribunalhad even happened. Christopher Pyle, Professor of Politics and ConstitutionalLaw at Mount Holyoke College, says that military tribunals do not need toestablish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt or even \"a preponderance of evidence"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"194\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.pointing to guilt\". He adds: \"The court just needs to convince the majority of themilitary officers present - all of whom see themselves as being 'at war' with thisprisoner ... that he has been involved in a terrorist act.\"62This Presidential Orderwas issued without a formal Congressional declaration of war and withoutCongressional authorisation to use military tribunals. Professor Pyle said he hasno idea how Bush even had the power to make such laws. \"Where does thePresident get the right to do this?\" he says. \"He claims the right to do this asPresident, as commander in chief, pursuant to the resolution passed in Congressafter the September 11th attacks and pursuant to several statutes in US code. Butthere's nothing in either the Congressional resolution or federal law that allowsthe President to override the legislative process.\"\"This fascist order from Bush for secret military \"trials\" applies to any individualthe President claims to have \"reason to believe\" is: (a) a member of al-Qaeda; (b) inany way involved in \"acts of international terrorism\" (a term that is not defined bythe order); or (c) has \"knowingly harbored\" either of the above. Administrationofficials have announced that they intend to use President Bush's \"Military Order\"in any case in whichtheydecide that an open public hearing would not beconsistent with the needs of security. Bush spokesmen say the order applies only tothose accused of war crimes, but the jurisdiction of the order does not include anysuch restriction.\"' The order therefore gives a liar, crook and promoter of capitalpunishment like George W. Bush, and his successors, the right to ignore the UnitedStates criminal justice system whenever it suits him or the agenda he serves. Watchfor these laws being extended to include US citizens when an excuse for that can bemanufactured. Yet the vast majority of Americans stand by and watch this happen,even cheer in support while believing they live in the \"freest country in the world\".You have almost got to laugh. Almost. The following are some of the other powersincluded in the \"Patriot Act\" and related new laws that were introduced onlybecause of the September 11th attacks. Much of the information is supplied by theAmerican Civil Liberties Union.\"The Patriot Act allows federal agents to search a person's home secretly; monitoranyone's Internet browsing whenever they choose; expand wiretaps without anyneed for permission from a judge (not that this would be hard to get, to say theleast); seize voicemail messages; and give secret grand jury testimony to the FBI andintelligence agencies. Law enforcement officers now have the legal right to shareintercepts of telephone conversations and Internet communications with the CIA,National Security Agency, Department of Defense and other federal agencies withno court order required and there are, in effect, no restrictions on the subsequentuse of recorded conversations. The Act does not prohibit the CIA and otheragencies from sharing with foreign governments the surveillance informationgleaned from a criminal investigation, even if this could put at risk a person'sfamily living abroad. This information can include medical records, mental healthrecords, financial records, video rental records, fingerprints, DNA samples from aperson's hair, employment records, \"employment-based\" drug-testing records andimmigration records maintained by non-profit agencies. Before this, FBI agents had"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre DisasterProblem-Reaction-Solution\t195to seek such permission from a judge or through a grand jury subpoena issued inconnection with a criminal investigation. These safeguards are no longer necessary.They can do what they want.Section 215 of the Patriot Act grants FBI agents authority to obtain an order froma \"FISA\" court or any federal magistrate requiring any person or business toproduce any books, records, documents or items. FISA is the US ForeignIntelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 that was \"updated\" across the millennium toallow wiretaps of American residents who would otherwise be beyond the FBI'sauthority. Under the Patriot Act a judge has no discretion with these FBI requests.He or she must issue the order after receiving an FBI application that claims to beinvolved in a foreign intelligence investigation. It doesn't have to be true; they justhave to say it. This means that the FBI can secretly conduct a physical search orwiretap to obtain \"evidence of a crime\" without proving the probable cause of acrime. All they need to do is claim \"intelligence authority\", even when the personwhose home they wish to break into, or whose telephone they want to tap, is anAmerican. Given the FBI's horrific and well-documented history of investigatingpeople merely because of their race or political views, it is easy to see how thesepowers will be used. TheNew York Timesalso reported that Attorney GeneralAshcroft was considering a plan to relax restrictions on the FBI by giving themgreater freedom to spy on religious and political organizations.66All these new lawsmake the FBI and the CIA, in effect, the same organisation - exactly what theIlluminati want in their agenda of centralisation and globalisation. The Patriot Actmeans that the CIA can now easily spy on American citizens, a role it has beenforbidden to take, at least in law, since the Church Committee exposed appallingabuses of its surveillance of American citizens in the 1970s. But now the Patriot Actallows disclosure to the CIA of \"foreign intelligence information\" obtained inconnection with a domestic criminal investigation, without defining \"foreignintelligence information\". This, says the American Civil Liberties Union, represents\"extraordinary extensions of the previous powers of the foreign intelligenceagencies, including the CIA, to obtain information about Americans\".67All this willhappen without a court order.Ashcroft's Department of \"Justice\" can now monitor conversations between\"suspects\" and their lawyers (when they can get one). All \"Justice\" Departmentofficials require is \"reasonable suspicion\" (and they decide what that means) tobelieve that a prisoner \"may\" use communications with attorneys or their agents\"to further or facilitate acts of terrorism\". The regulation requires that the Directorof the Bureau of Prisons \"shall ... provide appropriate procedures for themonitoring or review of communications between that inmate and attorneys orattorneys' agents who are traditionally covered by the attorney-client privilege. Thisincludes pre-trial detainees who have not been convicted of any crime and aretherefore presumed innocent, and material witnesses and individuals who are beingheld on suspected immigration violations and are not accused of any crime.Under the Patriot Act, financial institutions now monitor daily financialtransactions even more closely than before and are required to share this information"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"196\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.with federal agencies, including intelligence agencies like the CIA. These provisionsgo far beyond searching for terrorist funds or money laundering (like the Bush-connected BCCI) and involve snooping on perfectly innocent financial transactionsby American citizens. Once again the \"fight against terrorism\" is being used tomassively increase surveillance of the very population these new laws are supposedto be \"protecting\" from terrorism. Section 358 allows law enforcement andintelligence agencies to gain easy and secret access to credit reports. These agencieswould not have to ask a judge for permission and the person involved would neverknow what had happened. It is another \"do what you like\" invasion of privacy, withthe agencies having no requirement to justify their actions with evidence of a crime,suspicious activity, or even relevance to an investigation.When it comes to the government being open to the same scrutiny, however,that's another story. Ashcroft has sought to undermine the American Freedom ofInformation Act with a change of policy that encourages federal agencies to resistFreedom of Information Act requests whenever they have legal grounds to do so.He has told them to withhold information whenever they could argue a \"soundlegal basis\" for doing so. On one hand, they are introducing laws to gather moreinformation about people while, on the other, seeking to prevent them knowing,under Freedom of Information, what is on government files.\"Homeland security\" (homeland control)The Patriot Act was claimed to be the result of two weeks of \"closed-doornegotiations\" between Congress and the Bush administration. Bullshit.Congressman Ron Paul said they were not even allowed to read the Patriot Billbefore they were asked to vote on it, and the \"sunset clauses\" that people were ledto believe limited the period the laws are in force turn out not to apply to the mostimportant areas that remove basic freedoms. The legislation, as always in thesecases, was already drafted and waiting before those planes struck the World TradeCenter. Coordinating this invasion of privacy and the vast expansion of surveillanceunder the guise of fighting terrorism is the Office of Homeland Security, moreaccurately known in my house as the Office of Homeland Control. It is amazinghow often that, by swapping the word \"security\" for \"control\", you get the truthabout an organisation or situation. In fact you can do this with all the Illuminatistatements. Reverse them and you see what they really mean. The Office ofHomeland Security - a classic Big Brother title - was created by Bush immediately\"after\" September 11th and is headed by the President's pal Tom Ridge, the formerGovernor of Pennsylvania. After he was elected Governor in 1993 he introducednew anti-crime laws, some of which were ruled unconstitutional.\" Ridgecampaigned for all juveniles to be tried as adults and for them to serve adultsentences in adult prisons. He reversed a three-to-one ratio of granting parole to athree-to-one ratio against.' Under Ridge's leadership, the state police were orderedto raid the headquarters of people preparing to protest at the 2000 RepublicanNational Convention in Philadelphia. Some 500 people were arrested before theycould protest and most were never convicted of any offence. Ridge and Bush both"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Problem-Reaction-Solution\t197have the same approach to \"law enforcement\". Ridge presided over the first stateexecution in Pennsylvania since 1960 and then embarked on a policy of signing astream of execution warrants, just as Bush did as Governor of Texas. It was Ridgewho pressed for the legislation that introduced the \"three-strikes law\" and a fasterdeath penalty process. The three-strikes law was a stunning piece of insanestupidity that mandated life prison sentences for anyone convicted of three felonies.This treats a murder as a \"strike\" in the same way as filling out a false driver'slicence application. I can see why Bush chose Ridge to head \"Homeland Security\".Ridge's role is to create an ever more centralised pyramid of government agenciesthat will allow even fewer people to dictate the policy and actions of what aresupposed to be \"independent\" organisations like the FBI and CIA. As Bush saidwhen he announced the appointment of Ridge:\"Today, dozens of federal departments and agencies, as well as state and localgovernments, have responsibilities affecting homeland security. These efforts must becoordinated at the highest level.\"70In short, centralise and solidify the pyramid to ensure ever more control overever more people by ever fewer. Dick Cheney appointed Admiral Steve Abbot asRidge's number two. Abbot was Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the US EuropeanCommand during the conflict in Kosovo and was Deputy Director of Operations forthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (Colin Powell) at the end of the FatherGeorge Bush administration. In May 2001, four months before September 11th, DickCheney launched a review to \"strengthen preparedness against an act of domesticterrorism, particularly one using a weapon of mass destruction\".\" Admiral Abbotwas appointed to lead this Cheney group as Executive Director of the VicePresident's National Preparedness Review. Abbot is a Rhodes Scholar. These arecarefully chosen overseas students, like Bill Clinton, who are sent to England tostudy at Oxford University. These elite scholarships are named after Cecil Rhodes,one of the most infamous Illuminati operatives of the last 200 years (seeAnd TheTruth Shall Set You FreeandThe Biggest Secret).The Office of Homeland Security isdominated and controlled by the military through the Pentagon and it is theIlluminati goal to have domestic \"law enforcement\" conducted by the military, justas any fascist or communist state would do. Airport security is already controlledby the military because of 9 / 11 and that is designed to get the people used tohaving soldiers around calling the shots in public places. The military running theairports is just the start. As Timothy Edgar, a Legislative Counsel with the AmericanCivil Liberties Union, says: \"The military's mission is not to respect constitutionalliberties. Itsmission is to use overwhelming force to defeat and kill the enemy.\"72But then that's the idea. To the Illuminati and their henchmen like Bush, Cheney, etal., the peoplearethe enemy. Herr Bush announced in April 2002 another strand inAmerica's centralised fascist state. It is Northern Command, or NORTHCOM. Thisis headed by a four-star general and will \"coordinate\" with the Office of Homeland\"Defense\". The first head of NORTHCOM was widely predicted in the media to be"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"198\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.Ralph Eberhart, the head of NORAD and Space Command at Cheyenne Mountain,whose inaction on September 11th was a disgrace. NORTHCOM will coordinate\"homeland defence\" for North America and Mexico and this is the first time thatMexico comes under a Pentagon command as the global state continues to unfold.General Richard Myers, the head of the joint Chiefs of Staff, said NORTHCOMwould \"streamline the Pentagon's various agencies and commands now assigned tosupport homeland defense roles, putting them under one commander.\"73Take awaythe Orwellian language and you are left with: \"It will further centralise the militarycontrol of the United States.\"Most sinister of all is the \"Citizen Corps initiative\", the Bush (Illuminati) plan torecruit a million workers as informants who will report any suspected \"terroristactivity\" among their colleagues, friends, and clients. These informants will bedrawn from \"truckers, letter carriers, train conductors, ship captains, utilityemployees and others\". The American Civil Liberties Union said the Orwellian\"Terrorist Information and Prevention System\" (TIPS) threatened to turn local cableor gas or electrical technicians into government-sanctioned peeping toms. What wasthat I was saying about the masses policing each other? Now it's official. This is thewhole thrust of the Illuminati agenda - to get the people to keep the people in lineand act as a global intelligence gathering network in which no one will know whois a \"friend\" and who is a government spy. Like I say, they want a global version ofNazi Germany. Read George Orwell's book, 1984, if you want to now what theyhave planned.Federal evil malevolent agency (FEMA)One of the key organisations in the Illuminati armoury for their domesticdictatorship and homeland control in the United States is the Federal EmergencyManagement Agency, or FEMA. It is supposed to be there to respond to disastersand emergencies, but in truth that is only a tiny part of its operation, the part that isofficially funded through government agencies. The real role of FEMA is the onefinanced covertly by the profits from the multi-billion-dollar Illuminati-intelligenceagency drug racket. Former Green Beret William Tyree launched a lawsuit againstthe CIA and Father George Bush in September 1998 claiming that they had allowedthe drug profits to fund FEMA's covert activities without the knowledge ofCongress.' FEMA was created through a presidential Executive Order, anundemocratic, dictatorial outrage, in which the President introduces laws withoutdebate in Congress. An Executive Order issued by the President only has to appearin a legal newspaper called theFederal Registerto become law, and great swathes ofthe Illuminati's fascist-state-in-waiting has been put together in this way. Amongthe founders of FEMA was Zbigniew Brzezinski, the man behind the TrilateralCommission at the behest of David Rockefeller.

Ben Bradlee jr writes inGuts and Glory: The Rise and Fall ofOliver North76that the Iran-Contra \"star\" helped FEMA to stage a nationalemergency rehearsal in April 1984 known as Rex-84 Bravo. This was a practiceexercise in readiness for martial law and a FEMA takeover in the event of a\"national emergency\". TheMiami Heraldreported in 1987 that North was involvedwith FEMA in exercises involving the rounding-up of refugees and\"troublemakers\". Former Green Beret Colonel Albert Carone, who was murdered in1990, said in a sworn statement for the William Tyree lawsuit that he worked withNorth in CIA-Mafia drug operations and he also confirmed North's use of drugprofits to create and fund FEMA. He said that FEMA violated the United StatesConstitution and \"established a succession to the Office of the President in the eventof an emergency that circumvented the Vice President and the Speaker of the Houseof Representatives\".\" Colonel Carone added: \"Colonel Ollie North worked ondeveloping a plan known as FEMA, which would in an ill-defined nationalemergency, allow the US Military to take control of the United States to ensureNational Security.\" According to Carone's statement, the term \"FEMA\" originallymeant \"Federal Emergency Military Action\", but was renamed \"ManagementAgency\" because the public would more easily accept it. Carone said that aNational Security Council directive issued in 1981 states: \"Normally a state ofmartial law will be proclaimed by the President. However in the absence of suchaction by the President, a senior military commander may impose martial law in anarea of his command where there had been a complete breakdown in the exercise ofgovernment functions by local authorities.\" That directive, which allows a militarytakeover inside the borders of the United States, was signed by ... Frank Carlucci,now chairman of the Carlyle Group.FEMA and associated agencies have been given sweeping powers bypresidential executive orders to take control of all areas of life during a \"nationalemergency\" - whenever the Illuminati front men in government decide to invokethem. In such circumstances FEMA can force the population to live and workwherever they are told. People can be moved from their homes and have theirproperty seized, including farms and businesses. Their children can be taken awayfrom them and FEMA has the power to take over all communications, food andenergy sources, health care, finance, education, welfare and transportation,including your personal vehicles. The Postmaster General can order that all men,women and children are registered.\" It is also FEMA that controls the network ofconcentration camps, or \"detention centers\", in the United States that are in placeand waiting for the dissidents and \"troublemakers\" when the Illuminati fascisttakeover is complete. Yes, concentration camps in America, of which more later.Foreigners today, Americans tomorrowBy observing the treatment of foreign nationals since September 11th we can see thefuture for Americans in their own land and for the rest of the world also.

Anser Mehmood, a Pakistani truckdriver in New Jersey, was allowed no contact with his family for three months afterhe was arrested without charge in early October 2001. His wife and four childrenwere forced to sell virtually every possession because they no longer had anyincome and were heading back to Karachi simply to survive while their husbandand father awaits his fate. Mohammed Rafiq Butt, another man detailed, died ofheart failure at the Hudson County Jail in Kearny, New Jersey, on October 23rd.79TheWashington Postreported how two Pakistani immigrants were held for 49 daysbefore being charged with overstaying their visas and an Israeli was held for 66days before being charged with entering the country illegally.\" A Saudi national DrAl Bader Al-Hazmi, a radiologist at the Texas Health Science Center, was heldwithout access to either his lawyer or his family for seven days. After nearly twoweeks in detention, Dr Al-Hazmi was released with no charges against him. TheWall Street journalfeatured the case of Tarek Mohamed Fayad, an Egyptian nationaland a dentist in California. He was detained by the FBI on September 13th andtransferred to the Brooklyn Detention Center in New York City. TheJournalsaid itwas a month before his lawyer was able to locate and talk to him.' Some sevenmonths after 9/11 Judge Shira Scheindlin ruled that a Jordanian student had been\"unlawfully detained\" by Ashcroft's Injustice Department because, like so many, hehad been jailed purely to ensure that he gives evidence to a grand jury. The judgesaid that \"... since 1789, no Congress had granted the government the authority toimprison an innocent person in order to guarantee that he will testify before a grandjury conducting a criminal investigation\".\" Ashcroft, of course, said he wouldappeal. Not to me he doesn't. We don't know how many innocent people have beendetained in America without trial or charge since 9/11 because Ashcroft's operationhas refused to say how many have been jailed without charge or trial, and on whatbasis. The public have no idea who they are, where they are or in what conditionsthey are being kept. A look at the disgraceful, inhuman, treatment of the uncharged,untried, inmates at the US military base at \"Camp X-Ray\" at Guantanamo Bay inCuba, however, will probably give you a fair idea of the indignity to which they aresubjected. As Groucho Marx said: \"Military justice is to justice what military musicis to music.\" This is America, the \"Land of the Free\"? What an illusion. All thiswhen members of the bin Laden family were allowed to leave Boston Airport forSaudi Arabia just days after 9/11 with no problem at all because of their friends inhigh places like President Bush.Britain's fascist state rolls onIn Britain, the Blair government and his \"socialist\" Home Secretary David Blunketthave also been sweeping away still more freedoms and civil liberties. Blunkett, theone-time \"left-wing radical\" on Sheffield council, is now just another cap-touchingestablishment puppet. How the mighty fall. Following the Illuminati script after9/11, the Blair government now allows foreign-born \"terrorist suspects\" to bedetained without trial, a move described by the civil rights group Liberty as \"afundamental violation of the rule of law\".\" Internment without trial breaches the"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Problem-Reaction-Solution\t201European Convention on Human Rights and this can only be overridden if a stateof emergency is declared. So what did Blair and Blunkett do? They declared a stateof emergency, thus bypassing Article 5 of the Convention. The UK has jailed\"terrorist suspects\" on no evidence whatsoever. Lotfi Raissi, a 27-year-old Algerianpilot, was arrested days after September 11th and accused by the FBI - yes, themagain - of training pilots involved in the attacks. He was jailed by the Britishauthorities in a high-security prison for five months while extradition proceedingstook place to hand him over to the American government. But on February 12th2002, a judge released him because the FBI had produced nothing to back up itsludicrous claims. The FBI said he was an Islamic fundamentalist when he is marriedto a white Roman Catholic! His wife and brother lost their jobs because of thiscriminal injustice and his brother Mohammed said: \"They've destroyed his life, hisfuture and his dream.\"\" But rather than accept they were wrong, apologise and payhim compensation, the American government announced that they would stillcontinue to pursue his extradition on two counts of falsifying an application for aUnited States pilot's licence. One of these involves failing to declare an old tennisinjury!My God, these are the people \"investigating\" 9 / 11 and telling us whathappened. Fortunately a judge later dismissed the US claims, and Raissi and hisfamily were left to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives.Tony Blair has long targeted civil liberties. He has sought to reduce the numberof trials for UK citizens that are heard by a jury, and laws were passed long before9/11 to erode rights to data privacy and other freedoms. Blair is an Illuminati gofer.They put him in power and they have kept him there, so obviously you wouldexpect him to slavishly pursue their agenda, as he has on every front. New \"anti-terrorist\" laws mean that telecommunications companies are instructed, under theguise of \"national security\", to keep data on phone calls, faxes and e-mails. Britainalready has more surveillance cameras per head of population than anywhere elsein the world and I saw one school featured in a BBC children's televisiondocumentary that had installed nearly 40 cameras and the children couldn't movewithout being followed on a TV screen. All this is ensuring that children grow upsurrounded by surveillance and accept the Big Brother society as part of everydaylife.New laws have increased the rights of government agencies to spy on thepopulation's financial transactions and freeze \"suspected\" terrorist funds. Whodecides who is \"suspected\"? They do of course.Freedom, RIPNine months after September 11th it emerged that the Blair government wasplanning devastating advances in the Big Brother fascist state through somethingcalled the Regulation of Investigatory Powers, or R.I.P, Act. TheGuardiannewspaperrevealed that ministers proposed to dramatically expand the number of people andorganisations who could demand to be given personal data on the population. Thepolice, intelligence services, Customs & Excise and the Inland Revenue already hadthese powers, but the Blair government planned to increase the list to include sevengovernment departments, every local council in the country, any fire authority, the"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"202\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.National Health Service in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and 11 other publicbodies. These organisations would be able to demand, without a court order, thatphone companies, Internet service providers and postal operators give them detailsof a person's phone calls, the source and destination of e-mails, the identity ofwebsites they have visited and the location of their mobile phones, which wouldreveal the location of the user to within a few hundred yards.\" The government saidthese expanded powers were needed to \"fight terrorism\". Clearly this is anoutrageous lie. John Wadham, director of the human rights organisation, Liberty,said: \"This list demonstrates an issue that many people may not have realised: it isnot just the police who will be looking at our communications records, it ispractically every public servant who will be able to play this game.\"86Ian Brown,director of the Foundation for Information Policy Research, said he was appalled at\"this huge increase in the scope of government snooping\" and how these powerswere being handed to \"a practically endless queue of bureaucrats in Whitehall andtown halls\".\" Simon Davies, director of Privacy International, said:\"The Home Office has absolutely breached its commitment that this law would notbecome a general surveillance power for the government. The exhaustive list oforganisations who will be able toaccessdata without a court order proves that thisamounts to a systematic attack on the right to privacy.\"88The laws have fundamental implications for journalists and Internet users andservers. Steve Rawlinson, Chief Technical Officer of Claranet, said it dealt with a lotof requests from the police for private information, but many of these were a\"fishing expedition\" and they told the police they were not satisfied there weresufficient grounds. The new laws meant they would have no choice but to handover private data. Journalists complained that they would no longer be able to keeptheir sources private, but most of them should have thought of that when they wereridiculing those who were telling them this was coming. Maybe they will now wakeup to the fact that the fascist conspiracy they have been ridiculing and claimingdoes not exist is targeting them and their children as much as anyone else. HomeSecretary David Blunkett had the nerve to propose these new laws after pledging inthe wake of September 11th that he would not give anyone the power to routinelymonitor phone calls or e-mails between individuals. In the summer of 2002 Blunkettalso announced laws that force airlines to provide the government with details ofevery passenger they check-in on an international flight, including the name,address and passport number. The airlines said this would create chaos andmassively increase the queues for check-in. But why should Blunkett and companycare? While the people are queuing, they'll be in the VIP lounge.\"Airy fairy\" freedomsThe response of the Ashcrofts and Blunketts to legitimate concerns about the loss ofbasic freedoms has been depressingly predictable. It's an old, old, technique: don'taddress the concerns in an adult way as part of your duty as a public servant - seek"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Problem-Reaction-Solution\t203to discredit those who question and challenge your role as a public dictator.Blunkett called the concerns of civil rights campaigners \"airy fairy\" and, employingthe usual technique of painting a polarised picture of black vs white, he said in atelevision interview on London Weekend Television: \"We could live in a worldwhich is airy fairy, libertarian, where everybody does precisely what they like andwe believe the best of everybody and then they destroy us.\"\"9That, of course, is notwhat freedom campaigners are suggesting, and Blunkett knows it. But he says thatsimply to discredit those who challenge his decisions and to present a false pictureof the situation to the public. The UK Foreign Secretary Jack \"straw man\" Straw, aman I would not trust to run a market stall, said that \"naive\" campaigners againststronger Internet surveillance laws have hurt the anti-terrorism campaign. If youdon't support what we demand and accept without question the erosion of yourown freedoms, you are helping terrorists. Straw also sought to justify thedismantling of freedom when he told the media: \"The most fundamental civilliberty is the right to life and preserving that and sustaining that must come beforeothers.\"\" This is the same Straw who was a vehement supporter of the bombing ofAfghanistan that killed thousands more civilians than the attacks in America. Brain-cell activity never was an essential criteria for being a politician, in fact it can be aserious handicap to career advancement. Then there was one Kevin Hughes, amember of Blair's Labour Party, who said during the steam-rollered parliamentary\"debate\" on the anti-terrorism laws that opponents of the plan were from the ...\"yoghurt-eating, muesli-eating,Guardian-reading,sandal-wearing fraternity\".\"What a prat. In the US, of course, Attorney General Ashcroft takes the same line.When challenged on his attacks on basic freedoms, he told the Senate JudiciaryCommittee:\"To those who pit Americans against immigrants, citizens against non-citizens, to thosewho scare peace-loving people with phantoms of lost liberty, my message is this: Yourtactics only aid terrorists for they erode our national unity and diminish our resolve ...They give ammunition to America's enemies and pause to America's friends. Theyencourage people of good will to remain silent in the face of evil.\"92More black is white, more smoke and mirrors. Orrin Hatch, the aspartamesupporter and senator for the Illuminati Mormon stronghold of Utah, told hiscolleagues on the committee that criticism of White House plans was nothing morethan \"Senate egos\". He said: \"I would implore my colleagues, let's keep our focuswhere it matters: on protecting our citizens.\"93Yeah, yeah, OK, Orrin, you've doneyour job and I'm sure they will be very pleased with you. Senator Russell Feingoldwas the lone vote in the Senate against this silent invasion by federal and statedictatorship. He provided confirmation that at least some common sense andprinciple still survives - just, only just - in Washington. He said:\"If we lived in a country that allowed the police to search your home at any time for anyreason, if we lived in a country that allowed the government to open your mail, eavesdrop"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"204\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.on phone conversations, intercept your e-mail communications, hold people in jailindefinitely on suspicion that they were up to no good, then the government would nodoubt discover and arrest more terrorists. But that would probably not be a country inwhich we would want to live. That would not be a country in which we could, in goodconscience, ask our young people to die for. In short, that country wouldn't be America.\"94Such voices of sanity are so few. In the US Congress, the British Parliament, andtheir like across the world, fundamental attacks on freedom went through withhardly a murmur of serious challenge from politicians or public - all thanks to 9/11.Coincidence?Bush hides daddy's secrets ... and his ownBut get this: while the Bush government was issuing an explosion of new laws anddirectives to gather ever more information about the population and impose evergreater surveillance, he took time out on November 1st 2001 to issue an ExecutiveOrder that gives Bush and former presidents (like his father) the right to vetorequests to open any presidential records. Even if a former president wants hisrecords to be released, the Executive Order permits President Bush or any sittingpresident to assert executive privilege to stop this, and Boy George and formerpresidents are now given an indefinite amount of time to ponder any requests. Thisis a blatant move to hide the grotesque secrets of his father, other presidents andhimself, particularly, in his case, in relation to 9/11. How coincidental, too, that thiswas invoked just as records of the Reagan-Bush administration were due for releaseunder the Presidential Records Act, a post-Watergate law intended to ensure therelease of administration records 12 years after a president leaves office.95So who benefits?What happened on September 11th was the most glaring and obvious example Ihave seen of the technique I have dubbed problem-reaction-solution. 9 / 11 hadevery element in enormous abundance. First you covertly create the problem andimmediately name the person or people \"responsible\" to divert attention from anyopen-minded speculation or questioning about who was really behind it. Second,you report the problem through the media in the form that you wish the public tobelieve. Third, you offer the solution to your problem amid the manipulated publicclamour for you to \"do something\". The atrocities in America, and their aftermath,have provided an excuse for an open-ended problem-reaction-solution in the formof the \"war on terrorism\". How can you tell when you have won a war onterrorism? You can't. They have launched a war without end in which they canattack any country or target they can demonise as either \"terrorists\" or \"supportersof terrorists\". That was the idea. As British Prime Minister Tony Blair saidimmediately after September 11th:\"This is a moment to seize. The kaleidoscope has been shaken, the pieces are in flux,soon they will settle again. Before they do, let us reorder this world around us.\""},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster•Problem-Reaction-Solution\t205And on September 12th, at a televised event organised by the Rockefeller-Illuminati Council on Foreign Relations, the former presidential candidate GaryHart said:\"There is a chance for the President of the United States to use this disaster to carryout ... a phrase his father used ... and that is a New World Order.\"That phrase was delivered in a speech by Father George in relation to the Gulf\"War\" on September 11th 1990 - 11 years to the day before 9/11. As I said in theopening chapter, the antidote to P-R-S is the question: \"Who benefits?\" This alwaysreveals the force behind the \"problem\". Who benefits from 9 / 11? One group andone group alone - anyone who wants a massive increase in surveillance and controlof the people, individually and collectively; the further centralisation of globalpower; a systematic destruction of basic freedoms and civil liberties; an excuse toinvade, devastate and take over any country they choose to target; and a fantasticincrease in public spending on the military for operations at home and aboard.Whoever was behind 9 / 11 has achieved all of these aims and so much more. Whowants such a society? The Illuminati and their agents in government, as I have beenexposing for more than a decade. They want centralisation of power in all areas ofour lives until the world government, central bank, currency, army, police force,intelligence agency, and micro-chipped population are in place. They want anexcuse to send their armies into any country whose regime is not playing ball, orwhose land and resources they desire to control. One event has given them all ofthese things since September 11th 2001. Are we really to believe that those two factsare not connected, that all this is all mere \"coincidence\"? Are we really?Iwas interviewed on a Los Angeles radio station in the days after 9/11 by acouple of hosts who were not the sharpest pins in the box to say the least. I said thatthe attacks had been organised within their own borders by Illuminati groups thatcontrol the federal government and the military, and that they would soon see newlaws introduced by that same federal government that would remove fundamentalfreedoms from American society. The idea that agencies of the United Statesgovernment could have been involved in the attacks against American people wasmore than their neuron pathways could process and the hosts decided that I musteither be \"mad\" or \"on something\". So I made them an offer to come back on theshow a month later and I said that if massive erosions of freedom had not occurredin America by then I would hold my hand up and say I was wrong. They said OK, itwas a deal; they would call me in a month. The erosions of freedom duly took place.They never called."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"206\tThis \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want.
