Leads turn cold and paths of inquiry hit deadends. In the case of Jeffrey Epstein, even in death, the rabbit hole spiralsever downward, proving to be infinitesimally profound and complex.Disturbing questions about the convicted pedophile first surfaced on a nationalscale back in 2008, when Epstein received a sentence of just eighteen months inprison—and that, with work release—following the Palm Beach Police Department’sdiscovery of more than thirty of his teen sex abuse victims.Former US Labor Secretary Alex Acosta had helped prosecute Epstein at the time,and in the face of critiques, Acosta steadfastly insisted he had simply securedthe best deal possible. But when pressed as to whether Epstein had scored alighter sentence because he was a member of international intelligence, Acostaoffered a non-denial denial—in classic politician form.“This was a case that was brought by our office, it was brought based on thefacts and I look at the reporting and others, I can’t address it directlybecause of our guidelines, but I can tell you that a lot of reporting is goingdown rabbit holes,” said Acosta.Now, through the looking glass of a dogged and extraordinary investigation, wehave discovered that the rabbit hole goes deeper than anyone ever could haveexpected. The world has known only half of the sordid saga that is the life anddeath of billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.Until now.Dead men like Epstein tell no tales, but we can. In this book, we’ll tell a taleof sex victims, dead bodies, spies, death threats, and an internationalconspiracy the likes of which we have never seen before.Everyone knows that Epstein used his mathematical genius and ruthless ambitionto slither into high society, where he posed as a billionaire investor andcharming philanthropist.His mysterious riches, gaudy private jet, and impenetrable mansion fortressesallowed him to unleash his insatiable appetite for underage girls with impunityfor decades. That is beyond dispute.Now for the first time, however, this unprecedented examination sheds light onan even shadier side of Epstein’s dark and twisted life, a story that traversesthe globe from the White House, to Manhattan, through New Mexico, Palm Beach,Paris, the US Virgin Islands, and the Israeli Mossad, ending at the Kremlin inRussia.image [../Images/star.jpg]Epstein, at least on the surface, was once the epitome of a jet-settingbachelor. The secretive self-made man who rose from blue-collar Brooklyn to theheights of luxury was a close confidant of presidents, prime ministers, A-listmovie stars, and even British royalty.But for years, there were disturbing whispers that the enigmatic billionaire wassecretly running an underground sex-trafficking ring—pimping out the young girlsunder his control to the richest and most influential men in the world.Epstein and his powerful pals didn’t do much to hide their perversions.Whether on his private jet, dubbed the “Lolita Express,” at his mansions aroundthe world, or on his own private island, Epstein traveled with a roster of youngwomen by his side. For those men invited to join him, it was a global pedophileplayground.Yet these weren’t periodic seedy sexcapades. The horrors orchestrated by Epsteinwere carried out on a daily basis.A massive police investigation in Florida ended with a whimper in 2007. Afterjust a few months in jail, Epstein was back at it again, flaunting his freedomand his debauchery around the world for more than a decade.In the summer of 2019, though, the possibility of justice at last seemed real asfederal agents officially charged Epstein with organizing the most extensivechild sex ring in history.Some of his brave victims—now adult women—came forward to break their silenceand confront their abuser. It seemed his sickest misdeeds would finally berevealed, and those who took part in the corrupt conspiracy would be thrust intothe spotlight.The public was poised to finally learn the awful truth, and to hold all thoseinvolved accountable.But hopes for long-overdue justice were shattered on August 10 when Epstein wasfound dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City.The verdict: suicide.The timing: convenient, to say the least.The man at the center of the monstrous scheme, the devil who might have finallyconfessed to save what was left of his soul, was forever silenced.With no one else charged in the indictment, the criminal case against Epsteinhimself was dropped. There would be no public trial and no further firsthandevidence unleashed. It seemed that Epstein had ultimately escaped criminalpunishment and had silenced his victims yet again.But that story is not over.image [../Images/star.jpg]For the past eight years, this team of investigators has followed the trail ofEpstein’s darkest secrets, wherever they led. We conducted dozens of hours ofinterviews with those who knew Epstein best, secured previously unreleaseddocuments under Freedom of Information Act laws, uncovered and questioned newvictims and witnesses—including his onetime chauffeur and his New Mexico“massage therapist” recruiter—obtained recordings of a defiant Epstein himselfprotesting his innocence, and uncovered photos inside his sex dens of sin andonboard his private jet, the Lolita Express.At times, we faced pushback.At times, the facts stopped adding up.That was when we knew we had to dig deeper into Epstein’s dark world.Luckily, in this case the law would aid our efforts to expose him. Many of ourprevious investigations into the life of Jeffrey Epstein were hamstrung by thesimple fact that he was still alive.When an individual is still living, it can be virtually impossible to obtainpolice files, deposition audio, sealed court documents, or any evidence relatedto their case. But when a person dies, this information can finally be madepublic with little restriction.This reality is what allowed us to deliver Epstein: Dead Men Tell No Tales, anunprecedented probe into his life and death aimed at uncovering the real truth.The death of inmate 76318–054 allowed us more access into his personal life thanever before. Here, for the first time ever, we have compiled the shockinginformation that ultimately led to credible leads and disturbing new evidence.We have pieced together the scattered puzzle he left behind.Through it all, we fought tirelessly with law enforcement officials to unsealdocuments and obtain clues that might otherwise have been overlooked. Wetraveled to New York, Florida, Paris, Russia, and New Mexico in search of thetruth, leaving no stone unturned as we uncovered an epic drama of crime, wealth,betrayal, and international intrigue.We did it all for years with one goal in mind.We sought an answer to the question the whole world has been asking: How—andwhy—did the man that President Donald Trump once called a “terrific guy” becomeone of the world’s most evil criminals? And why was he able to evade truejustice for so long?image [../Images/star.jpg]The story of Jeffrey Epstein—as the world knows it—is shocking, and tragic. Thefull and real story—as revealed here for the first time—is so scandalous that itraises pressing questions that implicate the world’s elite.How much did Epstein pals President Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and PresidentDonald Trump know about Epstein’s perversions—and did they take part?How might they have helped him to continue his abuse, and to escape justice forit?What responsibility might they have for his sudden, shocking death?And will we ever know the truth of the sprawling tale of espionage and blackmailat the heart of this scandal?The answers to these questions—and more—will be revealed through this compellinginvestigation sitting in your hands.Be warned, however: Our reporting is, at times, graphic, disturbing, anddistressing, as his victims expose the brutal details of living their worstnightmare.Be prepared: Our findings also will send shock waves through the establishmentand the highest levels of the world’s watching, waiting glitterati.Be assured that you will finally learn the definitive facts about how it allcame to a brutal end in a grim Manhattan jail cell.Was Epstein’s death suicide—or murder?If murder, who was behind it?And most importantly: who could be next?—DYLAN HOWARD, MELISSA CRONIN & JAMES ROBERTSON"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1AUTOPSY OF A SCANDALFar from the hectic pace of central Manhattan, the cab horns and clamor die downas you enter the leafy streets of the Upper East Side.There, the stately and historic homes stand proud and quiet, decades of historybehind their stony gray facades. One seems to hold even more stories than theothers. Four buildings combined, it stretches across an entire block, consumingall the streetfront. Gargoyles crouch on the cornices. A thirty-foot wooden doorstands impassive and foreboding at the center. Bill Cosby and Woody Allen areamong the neighbors. Inside, there is a massive study, one like Sherlock Holmeswould inhabit. A towering bookcase lines the back wall, an oil painting—perhapsan Old Master—in the center. Behind that painting, a safe. Inside that safe,hundreds of CDs and DVDs. On those, thousands of files. Photos and videos.Sexual. Showing young girls. Some, with old men.FBI agents stumbled upon this hidden trove of evil during a massive raid on the$56 million, 21,000-square-foot property, the home of billionaire financierJeffrey Epstein, on July 6, 2019. Hours before, Epstein had been arrested in NewJersey on charges of sex trafficking.The files and their disturbing contents were the final legacy of a man who diedtrying to keep the secrets of a life filled with depravity; what he left behind,testaments to his sins.That New York fortress was a town house turned torture chamber, filled withoddities such as a painting of former president Bill Clinton in a blue dress andhigh heels, and a life-sized female doll hanging from a chandelier.In the rooms that once hosted Manhattan’s elite—from Mort Zuckerman to Googlecofounder Sergey Brin, magician David Blaine, Donald Trump, Chelsea Handler,Harvey Weinstein, former Clinton presidential aide George Stephanopoulos,Charlie Rose, and journalist Katie Couric—security cameras peered out from everynook and cranny.Tucked deep inside the house, a dark room was stacked with monitors recordingevery moment. Close at hand was a printer.In another hidden room among the seven stories, a massive professional-gradeprinter loomed in the shadows. On the walls in that hideaway were blown-upphotographs of female bodies—their heads and faces cropped out of the frame.Deep in one dark hallway hung a giant blown-up photo of a grinning Epsteincarrying a blonde four- or five-year-old girl on his shoulders. He had nochildren or nieces.The same day as the New York raid, hundreds of miles away, agents swarmedEpstein’s Caribbean island, Little St. James—Little St. Jeff, to locals—andfound more chilling relics. Through the window, we saw dozens of orange evidencebags stacked and ready for analysis. More photos of topless girls covered thewalls. His mysterious temple—painted in the colors of the Israeli flag—at last,was breached. (Oddly, investigators found buckets of paint, ladders, andscaffolding inside, as if it had been recently renovated.) Still more files wererecovered; dozens of secret cameras, discovered.As fossilized bones sketch the outlines of prehistoric beasts, so too do theseremnants of one man’s life spin out into fearsome forms upon contemplation.What purpose would it serve Jeffrey Epstein—a man who had everything—to recordand curate the most private moments of others?The evidence points overwhelmingly to one possibility: blackmail.In a world of disturbing secrets and deception, Epstein’s international web ofblackmail was the aspect of his life that he most desperately tried to hide. Wasit the one thing that could have truly destroyed it all?Even more importantly, how was this web of blackmail connected to yet anotherquestion hanging over Epstein and his dark legacy: How did he amass a fortune torival some of the richest individuals in the world?Epstein was estimated to have been worth roughly $500 million at the time of hisdeath, despite not having any public means of income. Financial documentsuncovered in recent weeks show hundreds of millions of dollars flowing into hisshady businesses in the US Virgin Islands: Southern Trust and Financial Trust.Local officials had given him an extremely lax tax deal. No one really askedquestions.For Epstein, the money kept rolling in—and out—right up to the end.Two days before his death was reported, he secretly signed a new will thatplaced his millions into a trust, forever hiding its movements. Listed as theexecutors were Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, two longtime associates.Epstein’s former colleague Steven Hoffenberg claims that Indyke and Kahn hadonce been tasked with investigating Epstein’s financial misdeeds at investmentgroup Towers Financial in the 1990s, an investigation that ended with Hoffenbergsentenced to twenty years in prison for running a Ponzi scheme that the SECconsidered to be one of the largest in history—at least, prior to BernieMadoff’s crimes a decade later. Epstein, however, skipped off scot-free.Why were those men chosen as executors?Who really inherited Epstein’s trust?If he really died, why has his fortune not been seized as evidence in theongoing investigation into his crimes?Moreover, if no one inherited those millions . . . is it because he’s stillalive?If so, where is Jeffrey Epstein?Will he ever meet justice?The answers are there, in what Epstein left behind. In his connections, hiscrimes, his financial dealings and fears, lies the truth.One of the most disturbing stories in recent memory, Epstein’s tale may also bethe most complicated. Yet, it is lying right in front of you.All you have to do is put together the pieces."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2THE BIRTH OF A MONSTEROn July 6, 2019, federal agents swarmed a private jet at New Jersey’s privateTeterboro airport.As an unsuspecting Jeffrey Epstein walked off the plane, he was apprehended,handcuffed and placed under arrest—for sex trafficking.The events of that day not only shocked the convicted pedophile, a man who hadlong evaded justice but also, stunned the world, a world that had thought hisreign of lawless horrors would continue forever.As Epstein descended through the clouds to his ultimate destiny, he surely hadno idea what awaited him on the tarmac.In those final last moments of blissful ignorance, he would have passed over thevery place where it all began. Looking from the windows of his plush privatejet, once known as the “Lolita Express,” Epstein could have looked down upon thetidy streets and neatly appointed homes of Sea Gate, Brooklyn, the quaintmiddle-class neighborhood in which he was raised.As he walked those streets decades before, no one ever could have expected whatwas to come: how high he would rise, how far he would fall, and how thoroughlyhis life, his reputation, and his circumstances would change.image [../Images/star.jpg]Born on January 20, 1953, Jeffrey Epstein was the cherished first child ofschool aide Pauline and gardener Seymour.On the day of his birth, Dwight D. Eisenhower was sworn in as the thirty-fourthpresident President of the United States, and shared an ominous warning in hisinauguration address: “We sense with all our faculties that forces of good andevil are massed and armed and opposed as rarely before in history.” How littledid he know.Epstein’s parents had married only months earlier, when Pauline was alreadypregnant with Jeffrey. Both were children of Jewish European immigrants, andmany of their family members had been killed in the Holocaust. Nothing in theirbackground could have hinted at the hellish crimes their son would commit.A year after Jeffrey’s birth, his younger brother Mark was born. The two boyswere raised in the quiet enclave of Sea Gate.Epstein’s childhood friend Gary Grossberg spoke exclusively to reporter AndyTillett about his quiet young life with his charming friend, Jeff—and thesurprising way his friend’s life has turned out.“Sea Gate was a very, very beautiful, happy family community,” Grossberg began.“If you go out to Sea Gate, Coney Island was there, and it was just very, veryprivate. The beach was there, the ocean was there. It was very, very charming,very charming.”He continued:It was great. It was wonderful. The Epsteins are just lovely, lovely people.Absolutely the best. No doubt about it. No doubt in my mind. His mother, justthe most wonderful woman. In fact, you know something? When I speak to you, Ispeak to you with his mother’s heart. Okay?You’ve got to remember this was in the seventies, and life was very different.There was no Internet. There was no high-profile cable TV. There was no media.There was no nonsense. . . .I was actually close with Mark, his brother, but Jeff was a friend.We didn’t share a lot of time because he was a year older than us, and he was ina different grade. And due to his magnetic personality and well-being, he was indifferent circles. . . .He was always a gentleman, always very kind with everyone. And he did a lot ofthings for a lot of people. . . .Always did things right. The Epsteins, they’re like that. They’re good, kindpeople, whether it’s in education, philanthropy, the facilitation of people.They were around people who were doing these types of things.People are not talking about that. They’re only talking about the individualswho were so-called around him. So it’s just unfortunate that this particularsituation came down and turned into a cancer.Jeffrey’s a very good-looking guy, number one. Very, very talented. He’s gotmoney and people, women. They became jealous, whatever it may be. And so I don’tbelieve all these stories about all this nonsense. I’m not saying that therewere no improprieties, because who knows, I wasn’t there. But I can only tellyou about the caliber of the individual that people are talking about. . . .I only knew and know of the Epsteins in a very, very wonderful way, and it’simportant for people to speak the truth. And as I say, I don’t believe any ofthese stories about any of that stuff going on because I don’t know him thatway. I’m telling you the truth. And I’m not trying to hide anything. I’m lettingyou know exactly. I don’t believe it.I truly believe that this was politically motivated. I guarantee you that hewould have never been arrested if Alex Acosta was not on Trump’s cabinet. If hewasn’t connected, if there was no election, if there was nothing happening . . .it’s shit. Everything had happened. It’s very sad.”Like most children in the neighborhood, Epstein attended local public schoolswith Grossberg, later entering the Lafayette High School in South-CentralBrooklyn.Already making his mark, Epstein skipped his freshman and sophomore years, andjoined the math team, where he competed with Brenda Solovitz. In an exclusiveinterview with our team, Solovitz said Epstein still seemed like a normal guy inhigh school, too.At that time, he seemed to be just like a normal person. I don’t know of himdoing anything outrageous. He was no worse and no different to the rest of us atthat point.“He probably came to my house as part of the math team. Sometimes I made alasagna and they’d all come over for lunch, but that was it really.I don’t know what he did, but he seemed normal to us. There was nothing abouthis behavior that seemed off.He was really bright, and he was in the honors classes I was in, and certainlywe moved in the same classes. He seemed fine, just seemed normal, y’know? Hewasn’t standoffish from people. He was funny sometimes. He fit right in. Hedidn’t seem like a geek. To me, he seemed like a normal person.His father worked in the parks department and that wasn’t unusual at that time.A lot of us came from lower middle—what used to be middle class, but we lived inhousing projects and things like that. It was just our fathers’ luck, but wedidn’t have a lot of money.To me he was a normal guy, a really bright normal guy.From there, though, Epstein’s path would grow rockier as his dark side began toemerge. In 1969, sixteen-year-old Epstein graduated from high school two yearsearly and entered the prestigious Cooper Union college in lower Manhattan. AtCooper Union, he took advanced math classes and made extra cash by tutoringclassmates. But suddenly and inexplicably, he dropped out in spring 1971.Just a few months later, Epstein enrolled instead at New York University’sCourant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, where he studied the mathematicalaspects of heart physiology. But in June 1974—when the go-go 1960s had given wayto the gas lines and financial downturn of the 1970s—Epstein again quit school,having failed to receive a degree from either institution.It remains something of a mystery as to why he dropped out of both institutions.Still, the decision to end his academic career would not slow ambitiousEpstein’s rise through Manhattan’s elite.That fall, the twenty-one-year-old college dropout was hired to teach math andphysics at the Dalton School, one of Manhattan’s most prestigious privateschools. Located on the ritzy Upper East Side, Dalton then cost roughly $3,000 ayear to attend—more than $15,000 in modern currency. Today, the annual tuitionhas ballooned to more than $50,000.When Epstein arrived, the school was filled with rich kids from the upperechelon that he was desperate to enter. Soon-to-be celebrity students whoattended Dalton while Epstein was a teacher included Dirty Dancing star JenniferGrey, Maggie Wheeler (Janice from Friends), media mogul Rupert Murdoch’sdaughter Prudence, and Michael J. Fox’s future wife Tracy Pollan, who starred inthe 1980s sitcom Family Ties.In an unusual twist of fate, Epstein was hired at the prestigious institutiononly months after authoritarian headmaster Donald Barr had stepped down. Barrwas the father of current US Attorney General William Barr, the man who wouldlater be responsible for prosecuting Epstein, in 2019.As headmaster, the elder Barr had turned the notoriously progressive school intoa punishingly conservative institution. Girls were sent home for wearing shortskirts; boys, for having long hair. Teachers were forbidden from wearing casualor eccentric clothes, the colors and cuts that had been fashionable just a fewyears before. And if students were busted for smoking weed, they could onlyavoid expulsion by undergoing therapy. Barr was the Dalton dictator, and heconsidered his orders “ukases”—an Imperial Russian term for edicts made by aczar.“They think they can cheat on tests, steal from one another’s lockers andexploit each other emotionally so long as they have the right opinions about thewar or civil rights or something else,” Barr said at the time. “That is notmorality.”Halfway through the 1974 school year, the conservative headmaster clashed withthe Dalton board of trustees and resigned in protest. His replacement, Dr.Gardner Dunnan, rolled back some of the stricter codes of conduct, givingEpstein—a predator in the making—the perfect hunting ground.With no outdoor hangout areas, students socialized in the hallways, and Epsteinfrequently inserted himself into these groups. At the time, most students viewedhim as a quirky young teacher who cared more about gossiping than grading.“I won’t say that the girls didn’t like him, but they thought he was odd,”former Dalton alumna Karin Williams said of the young teacher. “You noticed him.He stood out as this young guy in this weird coat.”(Williams is referring to the full-length fur coat Epstein wore to school, thekind favored by the men who lorded over the streetwalkers off Times Square, orwho waited at Penn Station to swoop in on fresh-faced new arrivals to the city.)Under that coat, Epstein kept the top two buttons of his shirt open, exposing agold chain necklace. Most girls didn’t take him seriously, and perhaps that wasprecisely how Epstein wanted them to think of him: laid-back and approachable.“I was a 14-year-old and he helped me through a time when there wasn’t anybodyelse to talk to,” Dalton graduate Leslie Kitziger told the New York Times in a2019 exposé on Epstein’s Dalton years. “He listened . . . I felt like he reallycared that I was having a rough go.”Former student Scott Spizer even remembered Epstein popping up at a boozystudent party, and recalled the special attention he gave to the girls.“I can remember thinking at the time, ‘This is wrong,’” Spizer told the Times.“He was much more present amongst the students, specifically the girl students,during non-teaching hours. . . . It was kind of inappropriate.”What’s more, Dalton alumnus Mark Robinson claimed that Epstein wasn’t the onlyfaculty member cruising the halls for sexual conquests.“There were a number of teachers who looked at the student body as their nextmeal,” Robinson alleged.But Epstein didn’t get far. Amid complaints about his lackadaisical teachingstyle, the Dalton school board terminated Epstein after the 1976 school year.“It was determined that he had not adequately grown as a new teacher to thestandard of the school,” said Peter Branch, head of the high school at the time.Branch only recalled getting complaints about Epstein’s poor academic abilities,though—not his personal habits.True to form, Epstein somehow managed to turn that failure into a stepping-stoneto even greater success: a job on Wall Street.During a parent-teacher conference, the twenty-three-year-old had managed todazzle one student’s financier father. So, when Epstein was fired from Dalton,the broker connected Epstein with Alan Greenberg, a Wall Street bigwig who waspoised to become chief executive officer of multibillion-dollar globalinvestment bank and brokerage firm Bear Stearns.“This parent was so wowed by the conversation he told my father, ‘You’ve got tohire this guy,’” Greenberg’s daughter Lynne Koeppel recalled to the MiamiHerald. “That was Jeff. He was very smart and he knew how to woo people, how toschmooze . . . If that was his plan, it worked.”Later that year, Epstein landed a job at Bear Stearns as a low-level juniorassistant to a floor trader. He swiftly rose through the ranks, and within fouryears he had become a limited partner, taking on mega-millionaire clients likeSeagram president Edgar Bronfman. For Epstein, it was a boyhood dream come true.But it wouldn’t last."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3FOLLOW THE MONEYBy 1980, Jeffrey Epstein’s life was a fast-paced collage of frantic days on WallStreet and glittering nights among Manhattan’s elite. He had managed to climbinto yet another exclusive circle of society, and for the first time—it musthave seemed—nothing was off limits.As he began his finance career, Epstein was heralded as an uncommon genius fromthe start, chosen personally by Wall Street icon Alan Greenberg to be hisprotégé. (Greenberg served as Bear Stearns’ CEO from 1978 to 1993 and aschairman of the board from 1985 to 2001. He also served as a non-executivedirector of Viacom.)“Bear Stearns never had any training program,” Epstein said in a recentlyunsealed interview we obtained. “There was no course to begin. Alan Greenbergsaid he wanted me to learn each area of the business.“He thought the best place for me to start would be on the floor of the AmericanStock Exchange and then later move up to the trading desk and learn all thedifferent areas of the firm, including the margin department. He was amazing.”But in less than a year, Epstein found his niche. He analyzed the portfolios ofwealthy clients and came up with cunning money-saving schemes.Getting in on Wall Street before the 1980s banking boom allowed Epstein to builda spectacular network of connections that made him the toast of Manhattan duringone of the most prosperous decades it had ever seen. In just a few short yearswith Bear Stearns, Epstein had made millions of dollars, was traveling full-timeby chauffeured limo, had billionaires relying on his financial advice, and wascarousing around town with stunning women on both arms.A close friend from that period, Vanity Fair contributing author JesseKornbluth, recalled how Epstein became a rising star of the social scene in anexclusive interview with investigative reporter Andy Tillett, who contributed tothis book.I would say Jeffrey Epstein’s money, how much there is, how he got it, is acomplete mystery, and not just to me.I met Jeffrey Epstein in 1987, at a party given by Pepsi-Cola. He was with ablue jeans manufacturer. We chatted, and he seemed interesting. We decided we’dcarry on this conversation again elsewhere.Jeffrey was Peter Pan. He looked young, was fit, cheerful, and self-amused. . .. He had an ironic smile, which is congenial to me, since I find a lot of thingsironic as well. I guess the final thing to say is, New York was not then,because of the huge interest in finance, populated by very interestingheterosexual men. There were many interesting gay men, but heterosexual mendoing business, not so much. Jeffrey was one of the few.New York’s the big leagues. You’ve got to be good to do it here, at the level ofa Madoff, or an Epstein. He actually seemed not just smart, but accomplished.Those are very attractive qualities, and he was unmarried, so he was the idealextra man. He was invited places. He made his way rather quickly. There wasnothing about him of the freak and pervert that he would come to be.Still, Kornbluth said, when he got to know Epstein more intimately, the whizkid’s carefully constructed façade began to crack.Brighter minds than I say that he had actually really very little ability. Thathis mind skittered. That when the conversation turned serious, he made an ironicjoke and changed it. This makes it incredibly puzzling that, say, someone likeLeon Black, a major financier with a large, large department of tax experts,would say, “Jeffrey, you’ll be my tax adviser.” These sorts of things make nosense. As for his education, we know there was none. He came from Brooklyn, wasa high school graduate. His parents weren’t distinguished in any way.Harry Evans once described his wife, Tina Brown, as being cunning like a desertrat. That was a compliment. I think Epstein was, too. He had enough knowledgethat he could talk for five minutes about anything, and for six minutes aboutnone.I had no reason to disbelieve his fantastic stories. I was not then a novelist.On the other hand, I was interested in confirming.He sometimes helped dictators hide their money. He sometimes helped Americansrecover the money that dictators had. It seemed cheerfully amoral, and that iswhat interested me and make me want to write about him. I said, “Jeffrey, let mesee you work.”I saw him in two places. One, he had this vast office that used to be at RandomHouse. It was largely empty, and you couldn’t tell what work was being donethere.Another time, we arranged to meet in the lobby of a Park Avenue building, and wetook the elevator up to a law office, where Jeffrey was going to serve asubpoena. He didn’t get past the receptionist, and I found the whole eventpuzzling. On the one hand, you’re recovering millions and millions of dollars.On the other hand, you’re doing what a process server does.Those incidents rattled Kornbluth, and he began to doubt if Epstein really wasthe man he claimed to be. But there was one disturbing interaction that trulyended their relationship once and for all.I was about to be married to an extremely beautiful historian, who had justpublished a book of military history.The night before we were to be married, we had separate phones, and he calledher on hers and said, “Since you’re going to be married tomorrow, this is yourlast night of freedom. Why don’t you can come over and sleep with me?” At first,she didn’t take it seriously. It was just the sort of flip thing that any numberof friends would have said. But no, he was actually serious. That was a majortell.Then, a few days later, days after our marriage, someone purporting to be mecalled a number of women, including some of our friends saying, “It’s JesseKornbluth. I’d love to go out with you.” They called us to say, “Somebody,Jesse, is impersonating you.” Who would do that?My wife’s theory is, “It had to be Jeffrey.”Meanwhile, Epstein was growing ever more desperate—and reckless—in his pursuitof money and influence.In early 1981, one of Epstein’s colleagues at Bear Stearns tipped off managementthat Epstein was testing the boundaries of the law. After an investigation,Epstein admitted he had loaned $20,000 to a friend, Warren Eisenstein, who thenused the money to invest in stocks, with Epstein’s insider knowledge guidinghim. It was unethical, and potentially illegal. Epstein wasn’t fired, but he wasfined $2,500 and passed over for a partner promotion.That was humiliating in itself, but a few days after that there was an even morepainful blow. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) opened aninvestigation into Epstein’s client Edgar Bronfman, and Epstein was accused ofillegal securities violations.Depending on who you ask, Epstein was either unceremoniously fired at thatpoint, or quit in a blaze of glory. Either way, it left the unabashed socialclimber in a very undesirable position.No longer a Wall Street wunderkind, Epstein was jobless, homeless, and runningout of funds. He had to get creative.Desperate Epstein bent the rules even further and began taking on controversialblack-market clients, like Saudi Arabian businessman Adnan Khashoggi, the manwho had been implicated when the Iran-Contra Affair became public in 1986.(The Iran-Contra Affair was a secret US arms deal in 1985 that traded missilesand other arms to Iran. Officially, the deal was struck to free Americanshostages held by terrorists in Lebanon. Secretly, however, the Americangovernment had sold the weapons and used the proceeds to support armed conflictin Nicaragua. The controversial scheme—and the ensuing politicalscandal—threatened to bring down the presidency of Ronald Reagan. The hub ofmuch of the Contra activity was in Arkansas, while Bill Clinton was governor.)Epstein’s involvement was to help Khashoggi broker global armament deals, whichwas more than just old guns in crates; it included the sale of major weaponrylike the AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System) aircraft.Meanwhile, according to a US Defense Intelligence Agency report, Khashoggi wasalso one of the biggest drug traffickers doing business in Colombia in the 1980sand 1990s.But Adnan Khashoggi was not only an arms dealer; he also worked with and for theCIA. During this period, Epstein was known to boast that he was a CIA agent aswell. Khashoggi was not his only link. Epstein’s old Dalton connection DonaldBarr had worked for the OSS before becoming a headmaster. Barr’s son WilliamBarr would later work for the CIA as well.After Epstein’s death, the FBI would find he’d used an Austrian passport with afake name to enter the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, and Spain during thatperiod. His lawyers have insisted it was to avoid an anti-Semitic attack—not toavoid the attention of the authorities in the United States.Despite his growing social network, Epstein certainly was spiraling further andfurther away from the exclusive circles of proper society that he’d alwayswanted to inhabit.Then in 1987, he got what seemed like a lucky break, meeting Steven Hoffenbergof Tower Financial Corporation, a leading debt collection and corporate raidingagency at the time. Hoffenberg recalled that heady period in a series ofexclusive interviews with our team.“Towers Financial was a publicly traded company involved in accounts receivablecollection and financing and asset financing and was raising money on WallStreet in the capital markets,” Hoffenberg told reporter Doug Montero.Jeffrey Epstein applied to Towers Financial for a position in investment bankingvia an introduction from his employer in Europe named Douglas Leese who was veryunhappy with Jeffrey Epstein’s behavior. . . . Epstein submitted expenses forhundreds of thousands of dollars that were inappropriate. They wanted todischarge Jeffrey Epstein.They realized, though, that he had a great ability on Wall Street and thiscompany was partners overseas with Towers Financial. They asked me if I wouldinterview him and consider him for the investment banking division of TowersFinancial. That’s what occurred. That’s how I met him.The time frame of our first meeting in New York City at Towers Financial’sheadquarters was in the eighties, probably more like ’86, ’87. Jeffrey Epsteinhad worked in Europe. . . . He was very heavily involved in the illegal side ofthe business, of the money laundering, the spying, the arms sales. I’m surethere was some legitimate components that wouldn’t be criminal, but the majorityof his work product was criminal.At this late hour of many years later, I like being concise and I don’t want tomisquote, but I can tell you that they sold armament throughout the Middle Eastand around the world. There was a sale of aircraft, I believe. The AWACS or theair force protective planes for spying, they were involved in that . . . andthey were involved in all types of armament being sold. They did work apartnership with Adnan Khashoggi’s group in Saudi Arabia regularly and sellingarmament with Adnan Khashoggi’s folks in Saudi Arabia and throughout the MiddleEast.Nevertheless, Hoffenberg said:I was very impressed with the unbelievable personality and unbelievable abilityof Jeffrey Epstein to become a friend and the uncanny ability that he had as amastermind criminal on Wall Street.Jeffrey Epstein was a brilliant, brilliant Wall Street mastermind in criminalityfor securities fraud. I was greatly impressed with his demeanor, his ability tounderstand complex securities underwritings and sales to investors. He was alsobroke. He was literally without funds because he got into trouble in Europe andhad gotten into trouble at Bear Stearns.He was extraordinarily gifted. Very talented, very personable, very able to getto be liked at once by people, and a mastermind of criminality on Wall Street.He was so unusual as an executive and had so much ability. It was just verysurprising how gifted he was.His ability to sell you securities when you weren’t looking to acquiresecurities was remarkable. He would end up convincing you to buy securities inTowers Financial and you weren’t even considering that. He had that gift andthat ability.He was a master manipulator.But Epstein’s manipulations weren’t always done through legal means. By theearly nineties, the authorities had set their sights on Towers—and Epstein—foroperating a multimillion-dollar Ponzi scheme.Hoffenberg explained:The securities violations at Towers Financial was branded as a Ponzi crime. Youraise money from one investor to pay another investor. That’s the simpledefinition of Ponzi. Jeffrey Epstein participated full time and was a mastermindin that part of the Towers Financial crimes.Towers Financial got into an awful lot of legal problems and litigations andended up going into bankruptcy. Trustees were appointed to operate the company .. .Jeffrey Epstein had a very strong relationship with the lawyers that the trusteehired. Actually, the trustee in bankruptcy at Towers Financial, a man named AlanCohen, hired one of Jeffrey Epstein’s best friends and lawyers, Indyke and Kahn,to investigate Jeffrey Epstein at Towers Financial, which is remarkable.Jeffrey Epstein manipulated that occurrence without question. Absolutely, it wasa brilliant manipulation, shockingly.The outcome was just as jaw-dropping.“Epstein was not punished in the crimes at Towers Financial,” Hoffenberg said.“Jeffrey Epstein’s ability as a master criminal got him out of the penalty boxfor all of that. That’s what happened continuously in his other criminal chargesas well.”Hoffenberg, meanwhile, was sentenced to twenty years in prison, a $1 millionfine, and $463 million in restitution.Epstein didn’t just escape justice, however. Hoffenberg claimed he moved on tonew adventures—with millions in his pocket.“Epstein was able to fund his criminal enterprise Financial Trust Company and J.Epstein and Company,” Hoffenberg alleged. “There was another. I believe it wasInternational Asset Collections. He was able to fund it with the assets andmoney from the Towers Financial crimes.”Meanwhile, Epstein did have one reputable high-profile client: Les Wexner,founder and CEO of The Limited, a company that includes the lingerie empireVictoria’s Secret. Epstein first crossed paths with the billionaire businesstycoon in Palm Beach in the mid-1980s. Epstein reportedly stopped Wexner frominvesting in the stock market shortly before the 1987 crash, and as a result,Epstein and Wexner became very close, very fast.“They had a very deep bond, a very deep friendship and a very deep businessrelationship for a number of years,” explained Hoffenberg.Epstein took a hands-on approach to cleaning up Wexner’s vast holdings. Heunloaded bad investments, tightened Wexner’s budgets, streamlined his profitableassets, and even fired deadweight.By all accounts, Wexner was impressed—and grateful.At the time Epstein began working with Wexner, the State Department was hislandlord. According to property records, Epstein rented a posh apartment fromthe State Department at 34 E 69th Street from 1992 to 1995, for the cool sum of$15,000 per month. The home featured carved oak doors, a white marble foyer, abook-stacked library, a marble central staircase, antique furnishingsthroughout, and—perfect for Epstein—a steam room.Life for Epstein was good, but Wexner could make it even better.In 1989, Wexner had purchased the 40-room Herbert N. Straus Mansion atManhattan’s 9 E 71st Street for a cool $13.2 million. At the time, it was thehighest-ever recorded residential real estate sale. The fifty-two-year-oldcompletely gutted and renovated the interior of the 1933 stone masterpiece. Healso added security cameras, closed-circuit TVs, telephones, and heatedsidewalks to melt the snow.When the renovation was finished, Wexner gave it to Jeffrey Epstein. On January11, 1996, The New York Times reported, “Reached in Florida last week, Epsteinsaid the house was now his.”The way that Epstein became lord of that manor has always been something of amystery. Strangely, that initial property transaction was never recorded in NewYork City records online. When Epstein transferred the property between two ofhis own shell companies in 2011, property records recorded no original purchaseprice. Highly unusual, the document indicates that when Epstein acquired thehome from Wexner, the transaction did not involve money.The following year in Palm Beach, Florida, Epstein purchased a14,000-square-foot residence on posh El Brillo Way for $2.5 million, not farfrom Trump’s sprawling Mar-a-Lago estate.For the first time in a decade, Epstein was back on top. Still, there wasfurther he could go.In 1991, Epstein convinced Wexner to give him full power of attorney over hisbusiness affairs.“People have said it’s like we have one brain between the two of us,” Epsteinsaid at the time. “Each has a side.”As for Wexner, he said of Epstein, “I think we both possess the skill of seeingpatterns. Jeffrey sees patterns in politics and financial markets, and I seepatterns in lifestyle and fashion trends.”“He is always a most loyal friend,” Wexner continued. “He does not pick a fight,but if there is a fight, he will let you choose your weapon.”Epstein’s friendship with Wexner won him some legitimacy among the businessworld’s elite, but the stories of his sleazy backroom dealings continued. StuartPivar, an art collector who was also friends with Epstein at the time, toldreporter Andy Tillett that Epstein’s ability to spin the truth was unsurpassed.“He ruined a lot of people commercially from doing all kinds of terrible rottendeals, because he was basically a terrible, bad man,” Pivar said. “He outgrewhis normalcy, let’s put it that way. Jeffrey did things that people don’t do.“He liked to fool people. When you walked in [to his apartment] there was a hugeMax Beckmann and I went over and said, ‘Jeffrey, wow, that’s magnificent!’ Hesaid, ‘That’s a fake!’“He had fooled me and he liked the idea. He likes to fool.“Jeffrey would make things up you know, believe it or not. Why did he do that?Just as a game. He liked to keep things interesting . . . a form of practicaljoke that people don’t do. But Jeffrey did things that people don’t do.”In those early days, some questioned whether Epstein’s life of glamour andintrigue was as tenuous as the 1980s financial boom that went bust.Laura Goldman mingled with Wall Streeters during that period, and told reporterMarc Lupo that it was clear that no matter how Epstein tried, he didn’t quitefit in.“Well, I had some questions when I met Jeffrey Epstein. Of course, he said hewas a hedge fund billionaire. But I had some doubts about that because I went toWharton with some of the leading investors on Wall Street ’til this day. Went toschool with Steve Cohen, Gotham Securities, Joel Greenblatt, and none of themwere doing business with him.“I said to myself, ‘Well, these are some of the greatest investors of all timeand Jeffrey Epstein doesn’t have money with them. So does he have as much moneyas he says?’”In any case, it was clear that money wouldn’t be enough to get Epstein where hewanted to go. He needed something else."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4LADY GHISLAINEJeffrey Epstein continued his messy rise through the ranks of New York society.Across the ocean, British publishing magnate and aristocrat Robert Maxwell wascoming to the end of the line.The two men—separated by several time zones and a few decades in age—could havebeen friends in another life.Both had risen from humble circumstances to the heights of the elite. WhileEpstein’s parents lived among Holocaust survivors, Maxwell and his family hadfled the Nazis, moving to England from Czechoslovakia before World War II began.Maxwell then served with the exiled Czechoslovak Army, fought on the beach atNormandy, and parlayed his fame as a war hero into a publishing empire. Later anelected Member of Parliament, Maxwell traveled over land by helicopter, and bywater in his 180-foot yacht Lady Ghislaine—named for his beloved youngestdaughter.That yacht would ultimately take him to his watery grave.At 4:45 a.m. on November 5, 1991, just off the coast of the Canary Islands,Maxwell calmly radioed the members of the Lady Ghislaine crew to lower the heatin his cabin. It was his final order. Just a few hours later, fishermen foundthe tycoon’s naked body floating in the North Atlantic.At the time of his death, no one knew that Maxwell’s businesses were on theprecipitous edge of collapse. Within weeks of his demise, a $560-million-dollarhole was discovered in the pension funds of his companies. An embezzler ofalmost unimaginable scale, he had illegally raided the funds to prop up hisempire. As The Guardian noted, when the full extent of his crimes was uncovered,fawning headlines such as “The Man Who Saved The Mirror” were swiftly replacedby epithets like “Maxwell: The Robber.”When it comes to the official verdict on how Maxwell died, opinions remainmixed. One conclusion: heart attack. Another: drowning. Worse still: anassassination.“He was a man who could not face the ignominy of jail, of being shown to be aliar and a thief—and he very much knew that was coming,” Roy Greenslade, aformer editor of one of Maxwell’s newspapers, the Daily Mirror, told TheGuardian. “So I am a suicide theorist. I believe Maxwell threw himself off.”But Ken Lennox, then the Mirror’s senior photographer, who saw the publisher’snaked corpse shortly after it was pulled from the sea, is convinced: It was anaccident.“He used to get up at night and pee over the stern of the ship. Everybody knewthis. And he weighed about 22 stone [309 pounds] at this time. The railings werewire. So I think he lost his balance, because he was very top-heavy,” Lennoxsaid. “He was Teflon man. I don’t think he committed suicide.”According to author Martin Dillon, his favorite daughter Ghislaine, then thirty,wasn’t buying it either.“She was the one who felt that he had been murdered,” Dillon, author of RobertMaxwell, Israel’s Superspy, told our team in an exclusive interview.“Maxwell wasn’t the kind of guy who just sort of fell into the water because hewas standing in the back of the boat.”So, who did it?Dillon points to evidence that he claims is clear: “The evidence that Maxwellwas working with Mossad is the evidence of people like Rafi Eitan. Rafi Eitanwas one of the most famous of all the Mossad agents, so he went on the record tosay that Maxwell was an agent—much against the wishes of his former colleaguesat Mossad, but he did. And he wasn’t the only one. We had some very, veryimportant people make the same claims. Since our book was published, otherpeople have come up with other evidence, and the British knew that Maxwell wasworking for the Mossad.”Investigative reporter Seymour Hersh also alleged in his book The Samson Option:Israel’s Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy that Maxwell was tied tothe Israeli Mossad. Hersh was sued for the allegation, but later received anapology.Even more convincingly, files from the British Foreign Office released in 2003reveal that British intelligence had reason to believe Maxwell was a spy. In afile titled “Captain Ian Maxwell,” a British intelligence officer called theboorish publishing baron “a thoroughly bad character and almost certainlyfinanced by Russia.”Intelligence officer Digby Ackland wrote in one 1959 report, “Capt. Maxwell’squestionable activities have been brought to the notice of the Foreign Office onseveral occasions over the past 10 years.”Maxwell’s son Kevin denied that the reports were legit, but Maxwell familyfriend Laura Goldman insists that the mogul was a double or even triple agent.“Robert Maxwell traveled in very rarefied circles. He had information aboutgovernment ministers, about scientific discoveries, about Internet and datainformation. I think that was valuable to many governments,” she told Marc Lupo,a reporter who worked with these authors on Epstein: Dead Men Tell No Tales. “Myfeeling is that he probably was an agent to the Russians, the Israelis, and theBritish. I believe that Ghislaine continued his work.”According to Dillon’s sources, that’s a valid belief.“If I was running Mossad operations I would want Ghislaine Maxwell on mypayroll,” he said. “I would want her working for us, because she has access tothe kind of people whose views are very important in terms of the way in whichthe world functions.”Soon, Epstein was part of the mix as well. (By 2004, documents obtained by thisteam reveal, he was the custodian of correspondence and files belonging toRobert Maxwell, which were stored at his Palm Beach home.)Although it has been reported that he first encountered Ghislaine after herfather’s death in New York, one insider—a former high-ranking official for theorganization that is said to have killed Maxwell—has insisted their connectioncame far earlier.Ari Ben-Menashe, a former Israeli spy and alleged “handler” of Robert Maxwell,said of Epstein: “Maxwell introduced him to us, and he wanted us to accept himas part of our group.”Ben-Menashe claimed that Epstein and Ghislaine were already dating in the late1980s, and that Maxwell Senior grew fond of the young upstart.“Epstein was hanging around with Robert Maxwell and the daughter was hangingaround there too, and that’s how they met,” he told our team’s James Robertsonin an interview from Montreal. “Just two young souls, they met.”“Maxwell sort of started liking him, and my theory is that Maxwell felt thatthis guy is going for his daughter,” Ben-Menashe said. “He felt that he couldbless him with some work and help him out in like a paternal [way].”According to the former spy, the ultimate order to embrace Epstein and involvehim in the ongoing arms deals came from “the bosses” at Israeli intelligenceheadquarters.“They were agents of the Israeli Intelligence Services,” he told Robertson.“Later on [Ghislaine] got involved with Israeli intelligence together with him.But not in this arms deal with Iran business,” Ben-Menashe also told Zev Shalev,former CBS News executive producer and investigative journalist for the websiteNarativ.“These guys were seen as agents. They weren’t really competent to do very much.And so they found a niche for themselves—blackmailing American and otherpolitical figures.”In closing, Ben-Menashe told Robertson, “Mr. Epstein was the simple idiot whowas going around providing girls to all kinds of politicians in the UnitedStates. See, fucking around is not a crime. It could be embarrassing, but it’snot a crime. But fucking a fourteen-year-old girl is a crime. And he was takingphotos of politicians fucking fourteen-year-old girls—if you want to get itstraight. They would just blackmail people, they would just blackmail peoplelike that.”image [../Images/star.jpg]Even in the early years, the Maxwells surrounded themselves with bold-facednames.Two years before media magnate Maxwell fell to his death from the LadyGhislaine, he made Donald Trump the guest of honor at a May 1989 bash, we wereable to confirm. Also present was Maxwell’s cherished daughter Ghislaine.Did the men compare super-yachts? Maxwell had bought his from Saudi Arabia’sKhashoggi family: the relatives of arms dealer Adnan. Trump, meanwhile, hadpurchased his from Adnan directly—a purchase that was reported the very sameyear as the Maxwell party, 1989, in The Superyachts by Boat International.Perhaps taking a cue from Maxwell, Trump named his yacht after his daughter aswell: Trump Princess. Daughter Ivanka was then just eight years of age.For Trump, the purchase was a strange one. “I’m not into [boats],” he once said.“I’ve been on friends’ boats before and couldn’t get off fast enough.”So why make the purchase for nearly $30 million? Whatever the reason, it linkedTrump to two of the most powerful—and dangerous—men in the world: Maxwell andKhashoggi. Later, those same connections would lead Trump down a shady path toEpstein.The Maxwell family’s connections were just as strong across the politicaldivide.According to a 1992 New York Times article, then-Governor Bill Clinton’s closefriend Howard Paster moved from Clinton’s gubernatorial campaign to become thehead of Hill and Knowlton, a publicity firm representing Maxwell’s firm, MaxwellCommunication P.L.C. Other clients of Hill & Knowlton included Saudi Arabia,Kuwait, Adnan Khashoggi, and the controversial Bank of Credit and CommerceInternational.Ghislaine would later become close friends with the Clinton family, working inconjunction with the Clinton Global Initiative, vacationing on a yacht withChelsea Clinton in 2009—and even appearing as a guest of honor at Chelsea’s 2010wedding to Marc Mezvinsky.Had Ghislaine and her father established themselves as Epstein’s handlers inorder to blackmail prominent Americans, including the Clintons?In the meantime, Ghislaine and Epstein had their eyes on even more targets."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5THE LITTLE BLACK BOOK AND THE LOLITA EXPRESS“People think intelligence is just about tracking down terrorists, but if youcould get into the company of people, former presidents, people who are workingon some of the newest software and scientific developments. . . . That’s whatintelligence really is.”—Espionage expert Martin DillonWhen Robert Maxwell died in 1991, Ghislaine hopped a plane and moved toManhattan. Many people we spoke to believe she was ready to continue herfather’s legacy. Guaranteed $100,000 a year from her father’s trust for the restof her life, she found easy entrée into Manhattan society and was soon rubbingshoulders with billionaires and beauties in the City of Big Shots. So much so,Maxwell family friend Laura Goldman said that Ghislaine made social climbing herfull-time job.In the nineties, I spent a lot of time in New York, and I met Ghislaine Maxwellat several parties, openings. Basically, if there was an opening, she was there.She is one of the most intelligent people I met. She’s lively, energetic.I never quite understood what she did for a living, or if she did anything for aliving. But she was a nice person.What people don’t understand about the Maxwells, though, is they’re veryUpstairs, Downstairs. If you’ve seen Downton Abbey or other British dramas,they’re very upstairs and there’s a big separation. I really think she wasraised not to worry about the other people. They were a means to an end.Ghislaine saw something of value, however, in Jeffrey Epstein.Said Goldman, “Ghislaine Maxwell was nice to every lady in the room. But sheonly had eyes for one person, and that was Jeffrey.”I think it’s kind of apparent that they’re kindred souls. I believe that theydefinitely slept together, I just don’t believe they really dated. I think thatthe connection between them was that he had the cash and she had theconnections.Most of what I know about Ghislaine’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein camefrom her sister Isabel. Isabel really thought that her sister couldn’t quit him,could not quit Jeffrey Epstein. She loved him and wanted to marry him.When you’re someone who’s dealt with abuse, you always think if you do one morething right, that person will marry you, love you, and whatever. He wasn’t goingto do that. But I really believe that she loved him, she cared for him, andwanted to marry him—and would do anything to make that happen.Just how far would Ghislaine go?Seemingly overnight, Ghislaine became Epstein’s closest confidante, best friend,and, eventually, something more. Meanwhile, Epstein’s new relationship with theEuropean heiress drew the attention of the movers and shakers in the kingdoms ofNew York and Palm Beach.With Ghislaine by his side, Epstein had his passport to a whole new world. Nowno longer just another flashy Wall Street nouveau riche hopeful, he wasbeginning to be seen as a serious player with serious influence.Under Ghislaine’s guiding hand, Epstein threw lavish dinner parties withexclusive guest lists at his Upper East Side mansion, and more raucous affairsat his Palm Beach mansion. At first, the purpose of these early dalliances wasto win friends and business connections. But darker elements were bubblingbeneath the surface.While Ghislaine and Jeffrey posed happily for the cameras at exclusive events,they went even further to cultivate an inglorious secret social set behindclosed doors—on Epstein’s private jet, later known as the Lolita Express.A three-engine 727 jetliner, the Lolita Express was actually a commercial linerretrofitted for personal use. Photos of the interior suggest what kind of useEpstein had in mind.Plush and carpeted on almost every surface, the jet looked more like a 1970sadult film set than a mode of transportation, as our exclusive photo insertshows.Rather than individual seats, banquettes lined the wall or curved together incozy semicircles. The floor was padded.In the back, there was a suite with a bed and secret shower.The jet could host twenty-nine people comfortably, but Epstein and Maxwell morefrequently hosted intimate affairs in the sky.Flight logs we obtained in 2015 read like a who’s who of early 1990s society.From Hollywood, there were actors Kevin Spacey, comedian Chris Tucker, actorRalph Fiennes, magician David Blaine, singers Jimmy Buffet and Courtney Love.Media moguls Charlie Rose and Bill Wallace make an appearance. From the world oftech, Bill Gates. Political leaders such as Tony Blair, Ehud Barak, andconservative scion David Koch.Then, there was President Bill Clinton.Clinton is never named in Epstein’s little black book of contacts, although hisclose friend and counselor Doug Band is, along with a listing for “42.” (Clintonwas the forty-second president.)In the flight logs for Epstein’s Lolita Express, however, there was no suchobfuscation. According to the logs, Clinton first hitchhiked on Epstein’sinfamous Lolita Express in February 2002. They were joined by Ghislaine, her“assistant” Sarah Kellen, four members of the Secret Service, and five peopleidentified only as “male,” “female,” or by their initials.According to the three-letter airport designations in the documents, the privatejet flew from Miami International Airport to Westchester County Airport in NewYork State, where the Clintons have lived since 1999. On paper, it seems like aninnocuous trip made by powerful men accustomed to brokering political andfinancial deals in unusual settings. But that notion changes when put intocontext.President Clinton has claimed that he only traveled on Epstein’s Lolita Expresson four occasions.Epstein and Clinton actually buddied up for six trips between 2002 and 2003, toEurope, Africa, and Asia. On their “humanitarian trips” to Africa, Clinton wentwithout his usual security detail, and without chaperones. The men, it seemed,had hit it off.“Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropistwith a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knowledge of 21st centuryscience,” Clinton said at the time, oozing his trademark characteristicsincerity. “I especially appreciated his insights and generosity during therecent trip to Africa to work on democratization, empowering the poor, citizenservice, and combating HIV/AIDS.”Although Clinton referred to a single “trip” in his statement, in truth, theyflew on Epstein’s jet thirteen times during that eight-day overseas outing.What’s more, they were routinely joined by controversial characters, likeHollywood actor—and accused pedophile—Kevin Spacey, who joined them on three ofthose flights, and Epstein’s “personal massage therapist” Chauntae Davis, whogot onboard in Cape Town and flew with them to Paris. Davis has since comeforward with tales of Epstein’s sexual abuse. (Spacey has denied all allegationsof impropriety against him.)“On almost every trip that I did go on, there were young girls around,” Davisclaimed.In total, Clinton actually made twenty-seven trips with soon-to-be registeredsex offender Epstein.Clinton’s press secretary would later insist that all of their flights weretaken “in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation” and that every legincluded the applicable staff, foundation supporters and members of the secretservice. Clinton denied that he ever knew of anything untoward happening onboard.At least one person, however, was suspicious. Cameron Humphries was director ofthe Santa Fe airport, just miles from the 10,000-acre Zorro Ranch, which Epsteinpurchased in 1993. He told reporter Katy Forrester, who collaborated on thisbook, that many people suspected how the Lolita Express had earned its name.“When I was the manager there, it wasn’t unusual to see large private aircraftflying. You know, Santa Fe is a destination, and a lot of people fly in with aprivate aircraft,” Humphries said.He continued:What is unusual is to have somebody fly in with a large commercial type ofaircraft that’s been converted into their own private aircraft. I rememberdistinctly one afternoon there was a 737 that was sitting on a ramp. It wasobviously a private aircraft and I was just curious, and so I asked one of theemployees from the fixed base operator there.A fixed base operator is a company that handles private aircraft instead of thecommercial aircraft. They take care of the fueling and all of that. I asked oneof the employees if they knew who owned it, and they had said “Jeffrey Epstein,”and I had never heard the name before. This employee said, you know, “There’s arumor that he has a ranch here in New Mexico and that he flies in prostitutes.Some of them may not be of age of consent.” Young girls was kind of theimplication. He made it clear to me that it was a rumor, but I was really justappalled by this idea, if it were true.I didn’t know anything about him. I’d never heard the name before, so I didn’tknow if he’d been in prison or not or whatever, but I was so appalled by thisidea that I called our airport law enforcement liaison officer and I said, “Heylisten, this is just a rumor, but there’s this guy named Jeffrey Epstein thatflew his private aircraft in, and apparently he’s also flying in underage womento his ranch.” I didn’t know the guy, I’d never met him before, but you know, Iwas just so upset about this idea of this man flying around the country withthat kind of impunity that I felt like I needed to tell somebody, so I reachedout to our law enforcement officer.He said that he had heard the rumors as well, and that it was his understandingthat there was a federal investigation ongoing. That there was probably not muchthat they could do locally, but that he would certainly report it up. That waskind of the end of it for me, you know? After reporting it, knowing that that atleast I had said something. I’ll tell you, it was frustrating because it’s a bitof a black hole, right? You report it, and then what?The rumors were out there, so people knew it. And not only did people know it,there were people that were complicit in it. Why did it take so long?Meanwhile, Epstein’s escapades were also starting to raise eyebrows on the EastCoast.There, his team of drivers questioned why he had so many young girls aspassengers.Speaking here for the first time in print, Epstein’s longtime chauffeur.“I came forward in the hopes that I could help somebody, in the hopes that thisdoesn’t happen to somebody else, in the hopes that these girls that are nowseeking justice could find something,” the chauffeur, who asked to remainanonymous, said. “My story may help, but I’m still afraid of what could happen.”From 2001 to 2011, this professional driver made more than five hundred runs forEpstein, his girls, and his associates.“Back then, before 9/11, we used to actually pull up to the plane,” thechauffeur recalled. “There were times when you’d have five cars outside of theplane and he would get in one and Ms. Maxwell and the girls would get inanother, and then people I didn’t recognize would get in other cars because itjust seemed like he wanted to keep everybody separated.”The main port of call for Epstein’s mile-high crime wave was Teterboro Airport.Located on the New Jersey side of the Hudson River, it is a thirty-minute driveto Epstein’s uptown residence. The pimp and his posse used the transportationhub more than seven hundred times.“I was astonished that somebody could fly around like that,” he said. “He had ahectic schedule. He flew a $32 million jet like we drive our cars. . . . We hadguys that were big time bankers, hedge fund managers and all that, that werecustomers of ours, celebrities that had jets. Nobody flew like he did. It wasunbelievable.”Epstein certainly made an impression.“Epstein was an arrogant, aggressive guy who was in total control of thesituation,” the chauffeur said. “He would sit back there and just direct you andgive you orders. He was the king in the car. . . . I wasn’t even in the car asfar as he was concerned. He was more interested in the girls and joking andplaying with them and pinching them on the cheek.”He continued:The girls seemed a little nervous and [Ghislaine] just kept reassuring them,“Don’t worry, everything will be okay. You’ll be fine. Just do what I told youto do. And when it’s all over you’ll be very happy. You don’t have to worryabout anything and we’ll get you home as soon as you’re done.”They were young. They would fly in on his jet all the time. . . . I mean it’sobvious. How could you have so many of these girls coming and going out ofthere? I mean, if we just dropped them off and left them there and picked themup in two weeks, you’d say, “Oh, well maybe it’s his niece or whatever.” Butwhen you’re dropping them off for two hours and driving them right back,something’s up.One time, he was with two girls. I assumed they were relatives or nieces. . . .But I didn’t think anything of it at the time.We picked him up at Newark Airport and we took him and these two young ladies. Iguess they were about sixteen, seventeen years old. These girls today, they lookolder than they are. But we took him and these two girls to his apartment onSeventy-first Street.Like I said, I thought it was his nieces or something or his daughters, becauseat that time nobody even had a clue what was going on. But as time went on,myself and other drivers assumed something was fishy because we kept picking upthese teenage girls and he couldn’t have that many nieces! We would sometimestake them there to the apartment. And we were told to wait two, three hours andthen drive back to the point.So at that time we started getting suspicious and a lot of the drivers startedsaying, “You know what, I don’t even want to drive for this guy anymore becausethere’s something wrong.” But needless to say, I needed the money at the time, Iwasn’t married that long. I was in the process of buying a house. I wasn’t in aposition to turn down rides. I didn’t know what was going on.So I continued the work, and looking back today when I see all this stuff that’scome out, I feel terrible that maybe I could have done something to preventpeople from being hurt at the time. When you look back, what are you going todo?This was years before he was arrested. Nobody knew for sure, but we used to say,“Oh, I’ve got to go pick up the pedophile.” And then all this comes out and itwas true.The chauffeur also was responsible for shuttling Epstein’s pilot Dave Rodgersand his co-pilot Larry Visoski to their regular accommodations in the captain’sbuilding on Sixty-sixth Street.“I drove them a lot,” he admitted. “They never talked about where they went orwho was on the plane. The only way I could gauge who was on the plane was theperson that I was picking up. So they never talked about that kind of stuff. Iguess, you know, he must have had them on a tight leash.”When Epstein was arrested in 2008, Rodgers and Visoski were grounded for morethan a year. But Epstein found other ways of using them. According to thechauffeur, the pilots were ordered to drive the felon’s Bentley from Florida toTexas to get it armor plated.“Epstein was afraid that somebody was going to try to shoot him,” the chauffeurclaimed, recalling how the pilots “complained they had to drive all the way outthere with the car because he was so paranoid.”“But they did it because they did whatever he was told to do. . . . You’ve gotthis guy that’s overpowering them and giving them money. It’s a sad state ofaffairs.”“We were like a courier service, so to speak,” he said. “I overheard themtalking one time that they had a safe there. Dave mentioned to Larry thatJeffrey called and wanted him to take the stuff that was out of the safe andbring it to him. So I don’t know what it was, but there was a safe in thatapartment.”Indeed, there was a safe—one that police cracked open after Epstein’s secondarrest, finding thousands of pictures and videos of unsuspecting subjects insexual situations.Looking in the proverbial rearview mirror, Epstein’s personal chauffeurreflected on Epstein’s gigantic web of blackmail, likening him to a mob boss.“He was like the Godfather of the sky,” the driver concluded. “He could dowhatever he wanted, whenever he wanted, and nobody could touch him because hehad money, he had influence, and he had dirt on all these people. And he wasable to control and manipulate everything because everybody was afraid of him.Nobody would want that stuff to come out.”Today, the chauffeur has regrets about not coming forward sooner. Although, heand the other drivers certainly had their reasons.“It just seems that these people with power and money and prestige, when they’reinvolved in something, they will go out of their way and do anything they can tosilence everybody.”“Epstein was paranoid years ago that someone was going to kill him and now he’sdead,” the driver explained. “They say it was suicide and whether it was or itwasn’t. You know what? Karma’s a bitch and you get what you’ve got coming. Ithink he was guilty of all that stuff and all the proof that’s coming out saysthat it was true. So my feeling is that he got just what he deserved. It’s justa shame that it happened so soon before these people could get their justice.But the bottom line is, he’s gone and it’s just another piece of garbage out ofthis world.”For the chauffeur, though, this tale has a particularly chilling ending.“The guy who owned the company that I worked for, the Wednesday before Epsteinkilled himself, he died mysteriously in New Jersey,” the chauffeur revealed. “Idon’t know if it’s connected in any way, but it just seems funny that the guywho owned the company for all those years mysteriously died three days before hedid.”“I don’t know, it’s crazy. But I don’t want to end up like that.”More and more, it was becoming clear that Epstein was not just a jet-settinginternational playboy. Those around him, however, continued to keep theirsilence. Are they responsible for what followed?Model and actress Alicia Arden told these authors that she was sexuallyassaulted by Epstein in 1997. Although she filed a police report, she claims, noone would listen to her allegations about the powerful businessman.In May 1997, my good friend knew Jeffrey Epstein. She was in finance at thetime, and I guess he was too, although no one seemed to know anything about him.I didn’t even know who he was. I didn’t hear of his name at all. So sheapparently knew of him because she worked legitimately in finance. So she methim at the Beverly Hills Hotel.She went in there in a different matter, of wanting to work with his company, orhis company coming over to work with hers, or merging in some capacity. Somecapacity in the finance world. And then he started telling her that she wasreally pretty, and “Do you want to model for Victoria’s Secret?”She was not a model, and she didn’t want to do that. She said, “No, I don’t wantto model. But my friend Alicia does. You should meet her.” So then Jeffrey said,“Have her call me. I work for Victoria’s Secret. I could get her in thecatalog.” And she said, “Oh, great. She would love that.” And then he told her,“Any other girls that you know of, have them call me.” So then I did.I called him and he told me to send my pictures to him, to his apartment onMadison Avenue, in New York. At the time, I was excited. I thought I was reallygoing to get a picture or job in the Victoria’s Secret catalog, because he toldme that he worked for that. I was like, “This is great!” I was excited that Ihad kind of a hookup, where I’m not really going to go on an audition with a seaof girls.I bought more Victoria’s Secret lingerie, and I had a photographer shoot me inmore pictures, in that specific brand, and then I sent those photos along withmy existing book of pictures, my tear sheets.I was not a model who was starting out. I had an array of work in tear sheets,and beautiful pictures. So I took all these extra pictures for him, along withthe existing ones, and I Federal Expressed them to his apartment in Manhattan,on Madison.He called me and said he got the pictures, and they were great, and he’s goingto have a woman named Kimberly, his secretary, call me to set up a time. So shedid, and she said he was coming out there, to Santa Monica, California. And,“Would you like to meet him in the afternoon or the evening?”It’s not normal with all these modeling and acting jobs I’ve done, andauditions, for someone to call me and say we’re going to meet in a hotel room. Ihave been in auditions in hotels, but there’s other people, and you know thatthe casting is there. There’s like a sign at the door, and you have to sign in,and you’re there with a lot of other people. But I didn’t think that there weregoing to be other people there that day. I thought, “This is a hookup. This is amajor in, to getting in the Victoria’s Secret catalog, because my friend met himand then the secretary’s calling me, and he’s already seen my pictures. So helikes me. I’m not going to have to go on a casting with other girls. He’s justgoing to hire me, because he’s already seen my pictures, and I’ll get at leastone picture in the catalog.” So I was very happy about that.I wanted to go in the afternoon. I thought that was better. I still hadreservations about going into a hotel. But I thought, you know, this is SantaMonica, California, and this is Shutters. It’s a very expensive, beautifulhotel. But I never went back, for anything, after I went there that day.So it was set up in the afternoon. I was very excited. I mean I just visualizedpositive things, like, “I’m going to get in the Victoria’s Secret catalog, andhere’s my portfolio, and just walk in and show my pictures to him, and then hecan ask me about photos.” Usually they ask you, “Where did you do that magazine?Did that come out? When was that? When did you take that picture?”But I was just really expecting to already have the job, because of what hadhappened. My friend met him, the secretary called me, he said he worked forVictoria’s Secret, and I thought, “Oh I’ll get at least one picture. There’s nota casting with all these other girls, or a sign-in sheet. It’s just me meetinghim, thinking like that picture would be great in the catalog.”Well, so I got there, and I walked in the front door, and he was kind of in theback, like in a kitchen, at a table. These hotels are kind of like, you couldlive there. It looks like a mini apartment. And they’re on the beach.He was kind of in the back, in a USA sweatshirt, and black sweatpants, andbarefoot. Usually they are dressed a little bit more professional than that, thepeople who are auditioning.I was sitting on the couch, kind of like I am now, and he was kind of far awayfrom me. I went to give him my portfolio, and then I went back to the couch.Then he was looking through it. I had a tendency sometimes to want to kind ofstuff my bra a little bit to look bustier. I don’t know why I was doing that,because nowadays they don’t like you to do that in swimsuits and lingerie. But Idid that, and then he was looking at my pictures, and then he was saying, “Oh,you look a little bustier in this picture, and you look a little bustier in thatpicture.”So I said, “Well, Jeffrey, I photograph different all the time. I’m veryathletic. I could look bustier or not.” Sometimes I would pad bras or wear twobras. I didn’t really have to do that. I just kind of did it, and so he wouldmake a comment on that.Then he was looking and then he was saying, “Oh, well you look a little bithippy in this picture.” I said, “I mean I can photograph any way that you want.It’s just the angle of the picture, the lighting, the photographer, or if I’mput in a skirt.” So then he wanted me to come closer to him.I got up off the couch, and then I walked closer to him, to the kitchen table.So he wanted me to come closer to him, and he said, “Well, let me see your hipsand your butt.” And he was just starting to look at me, and he said, “I need tomanhandle you.” So I came closer to him, and he was touching my chest, and mystomach, and then moved down to my hips and my butt.He was kind of like evaluating my body, and then he started to lift up my skirt,kind of assisting me in undressing, and trying to take off my top. And I justthought, “You don’t do this in a normal audition at all.” So he was lifting upmy skirt, and my top, and touching me, and he said, “I want to manhandle you.”He said the word “manhandle” twice. And I’ve never heard that word from anyoneever again in my entire life. Not from anyone, like professional,nonprofessional, friends, or anything. I’ve never heard that word.So he was touching my hips and my butt, and my buttocks and wanting to lift myskirt up and said he wanted to manhandle me. So I started to feel uncomfortable.And I just thought, “I have to get out of here before anything really badhappens.” I had a friend who was raped and murdered around that time, so Ialways thought about that. I said to myself, “I never wanted to be raped.Never.” I felt if I didn’t leave, it could lead to that.So, he was touching me. My shirt was kind of coming off. I just put it all downand got my book and went to leave. When I was doing that, he was putting ahundred dollars on the table.I was like, “I don’t need that, Jeffrey. I’m starting to feel like a prostitute.I don’t need that. I’m not here for that.” So I left it, and then I took myportfolio and I walked out of the hotel room.I filed a police report. They weren’t taking me seriously enough to even file.And then I went back a week later and did it anyway.I guess the police officers ended up calling him, and he said, “Oh no. I don’tknow why she’s doing that. She doesn’t know what she’s talking about.” Meaningme. But I documented everything he said, in a report, and I’ve never done thatin my entire life, before or after that. I never needed to do that, but I felt Ineeded to [do that], with him. And I documented everything. It’s all in writing,saying that I went in there, and what happened.If the police officers would’ve taken me seriously and kind of investigated him,all those years ago, then maybe . . . It’s very upsetting, because I’ve thoughtabout that for a long time. If the police officer and the Santa Monica PoliceDepartment would’ve investigated him, and taken me seriously, then I think hecould have saved all the girls, the high school girls from being raped andattacked. Then maybe the girls could’ve been saved.But I really wasn’t taken seriously. My family, my friends discouraged me.Everyone discouraged me from going over there and filing the police report,because I wasn’t physically raped.I was assaulted, and I felt I could’ve been raped. He was touching me and takingmy clothes off, and I felt if I didn’t get out of there, it could’ve been worse.So did it need to be worse? Did I need to be raped? Did I physically need to beraped for anyone to take me seriously?It could’ve saved all the girls from being attacked. And I don’t know, hiscircle of friends, they just kind of put it under the cover, and socialized withhim at events. That’s what I saw in the news.No one cared. Not just the police officers, but no one in his circle cared tosee what he was doing.For some of Epstein’s friends, it was more that they did see what he was doing,but they just didn’t care—because they were doing it, too.What was it that brought these leaders of industry, media, and politics into theinner circle of a college dropout?Maxwell family friend Laura Goldman has a theory, as she explains here:I believe that Jeffrey Epstein was a genius, a savant, at understanding richpeople.This is what I know. Rich people are cheap, and rich people love nice things.What I believe that Jeffrey Epstein understood that and he provided people likeBill Gates, Bill Clinton with private planes, luxurious private planes and theyjust ate it up. It’s a sad commentary on our society.He understood that waving a private plane in front of Bill Clinton would makehim a friend for life. He understood that offering a ride on the Lolita Expressto Bill Gates and offering to talk to him about philanthropy would entice BillGates.He understood your weak point. It may be that he was exceptionally good at itand exceptionally good at understanding rich people, but it is the method of allbullies to do that.Epstein also paid for prestige, literally.He gave $180,000 to the West Palm Beach nonprofit organization Ballet Floridaand earmarked some of the cash for “therapeutic” massages. He gave $25,000 to ajunior tennis center in Maryland, $30,000 to a preschool in New York, $15,000 toan all-girls private school a few blocks from his mansion in Manhattan, and,perhaps least unsurprisingly, nearly $100,000 to his former employer, Dalton.From the 1990s through 2018, Epstein also gave hundreds of thousands of dollarsto politicians on both sides of the aisle, including the Clintons and theirfoundation, President George H.W. Bush, Ohio Senator John Glenn, New YorkSenators Charles Schumer and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Senate Majority Leader BobDole, Ohio Governor John Kasich, former Secretary of State John Kerry, and NewMexico Governor Bill Richardson (who would later be named in court documents asa coconspirator, a claim he vehemently denies).This is not a case of guilt by association. All of those men insist they had noidea what Epstein was doing. But ultimately, there were people who knew what wasgoing on and could have had stopped Epstein’s exploitation . . . and no one did.“They either indulge in these behaviors, or they like that someone does,”Goldman said of the uber-rich. “Why hasn’t been Bill Gates been forced to answerwhy he was on the Lolita Express? Why is Leslie Wexner still CEO of The Limited?Anyone that allegedly facilitated Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes should serve aminimum of twenty years in jail. I do not think those people are redeemable.There’s no way to rehabilitate them.”Epstein’s former friend Kornbluth, meanwhile, suggests that powerful men areconditioned to believe that presumption of guilt “does not apply” to them.No one says “no” to them. No one. The idea that these men would have sex with anunderage girl, and that that would cause them any trouble, any blowback, itdoesn’t occur.”Worst of all, Goldman said, are the British aristocracy.“I think that the French and the English and the aristocracy of Europe aredeviants,” she told Marc Lupo.At least one is."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6RANDY ANDYJeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell were playing a dangerous game, cultivatingfamous friends in the name of an international blackmail and intelligencescheme. The Duke of York—also known as Prince Andrew, eighth in line to theBritish throne—was their ultimate trophy.According to Maxwell family friend Laura Goldman, Epstein came into PrinceAndrew’s life because Ghislaine Maxwell “became friendly” with hisscandal-scarred ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York.“Fergie introduced Ghislaine to Prince Andrew and then Ghislaine introducedPrince Andrew to Jeffrey Epstein,” she said.Prince Andrew had divorced Sarah “Fergie” Ferguson in 1996, and was living it upas one of the world’s most eligible bachelors. Fergie was front-page tabloidfodder herself, photographed having her toes sucked by a Texan millionaire inwhat was the royal family’s biggest scandal ever—at least, at the time.Fergie stayed in touch with Epstein well after the divorce. In 2005, she left aphone message for Epstein at his Palm Beach home, obtained by this team, thatnotes she was “expecting” his call. In 2014, she admitted she’d taken cash fromEpstein to help settle her postdivorce debt.Meanwhile, Andrew was working as a British trade envoy, tasked with using hisposition to promote British business and drive investment around the world. Itwas a role he relished, because it also catered to the fast-paced lifestyle towhich he had always been accustomed. He even earned the nickname “Air MilesAndy” because of his jet-setting. As he traveled the world, little did he know,he would soon overtake his ex as the most scandalous royal ever.Andy also earned another nickname because of his bad boy behavior: “Randy Andy,or “Handy Andy.” In Epstein, the raucous royal found a kindred spirit.Their bond became so tight, Epstein and Ghislaine were invited as guests ofhonor to a June 2000 party at Windsor Castle, the Queen’s weekend home.Called “Dance of the Decades,” the party was the most exclusive royal event inyears, celebrating the birthdays of Andrew, who was turning forty, PrinceCharles, who was fifty, Princess Margaret’s seventieth, and Prince William’seighteenth. Obviously, the Queen and Prince Phillip were on hand to celebrate.A few months later, Andrew was again partying with Epstein, this time at HeidiKlum’s Halloween party in New York, with Ghislaine as his date. The costume shechose for accompanying one of Britain’s highest royals? A prostitute.In December, Andrew and Epstein returned to England for a weekend at the royalSandringham estate—the Queen’s country home. After Christmas, the pair was thenphotographed together in Phuket, Thailand, relaxing on a luxury yacht andsurrounded by topless girls. Queen Elizabeth was not amused.Still, the scandal didn’t end Epstein and Andrew’s friendship.A few months later, Andrew made the long trip out to Epstein’s New Mexico ZorroRanch. Deidre Stratton personally waited on his every need during that visit,and spoke publicly for the first time to reporter Katy Forrester, one of thecollaborators on this book.I had to serve him. I’m guessing 2001. Three days, maybe.There were pictures of him with Ghislaine and him and Jeffrey in the house. Ihad been told that Jeffrey and Andrew went way back.You know, at that time he was very, very pleasant. You could understand hislifestyle. We put him in a three bedroom, it’s called the Lodge. It’s reallyvery nice and the setting of it was gorgeous. There was this beautiful deck thatoverlooked this great kind of valley that was really stunning, and it was niceenough that they sat outside. So that would indicate late summer, early fall.But that’s where he stayed and his bodyguard stayed down at what we called RanchCentral. For him to just be out on his own, I’m sure was very different for him.And of course, we all felt like, “What do we do? We’re like fish out of water.Do we curtsy to this man?” And we were told no, because we’re not Britishsubjects. So we didn’t have to show any particular, you know, whatever to him.He wasn’t married at the time, and I thought he was very gracious. He was sogracious. He didn’t act appalled at all that here he was put up in this remotemanufactured home out in the sticks and given someone like me to serve him.Which, I’m no footman. I guarantee that. And so I just thought he kind ofthought it was novel.I offered to come up there and fix his breakfast. So he goes, “No, I want totry.” So when I got up there later to tidy up, you could smell burnt bacon. Andhe’s like, “I didn’t do so well.”He had a croissant with cream cheese or something. But I remember him trying tocook his own breakfast. Isn’t that cute? And he couldn’t even fry bacon.I do recall one other thing. I had to serve him some kind of food and I usedgarlic in it. Later, he told me that as a child he ate a whole bulb of garlic,and since that time garlic just turns him nauseated. I do recall that, and hewas very good natured about that. I bet he was hungry, but he was good-natured.I don’t know what he did. I don’t recall him being very sporty.Still, Andrew found other means of entertainment.“At the time, Jeffrey had this, supposedly she was a neurosurgeon, quite young.Not young, young, young, but beautiful, young and brilliant,” Strattonremembered.“She stayed in the home with Andrew and at one point we had all these differentteas that you could pick the tea that you wanted. She asked me to find one thatwould make him more horny, that he hadn’t been interested in her. I’m guessingbecause she understood her job was to entertain him.“Jeffrey probably had her on retainer and she knew what her job would be. Shouldbe, you know, to make these people happy. That’s what I thought. I do recallthem sharing at least one dinner.”Why would Epstein have invited a British royal out to the middle of nowhere, andset him up with a strange woman?Stratton supposed, “I have read where the island was set up with cameras whereJeffrey could tape these men with their underage people and use it as blackmail.I mean that’s the oldest game in the book, isn’t it?”image [../Images/star.jpg]Around the same time, a few months before or after Prince Andrew’s New Mexicostay, Ghislaine and Epstein flew to London to meet up with their favoriteBritish party pal. Along for the ride, according to allegations, wasseventeen-year-old Virginia Roberts.“That first time in London I was so young,” Roberts would later tell a reporterfor the National Enquirer. “Ghislaine woke me up in the morning and said,‘You’re going to meet a prince today.’ I didn’t know at that point that I wasgoing to be trafficked to that prince.”According to Roberts, Ghislaine stated something to the effect of, “He’s comingback to the house and I want you to do for him what you do for Epstein.” Later,Roberts would claim that she had been Epstein’s personal sex slave for months atthe time.Roberts alleged the encounter with Prince Andrew took place at Ghislaine’sLondon home.A photo taken at the same location would later emerge, showing Prince Andrewwith his arm around Virginia’s bare midriff, and a grinning Ghislaine in thebackground.Roberts continued:She asked Andrew how old he thought I was. He guessed 17. They all kind oflaughed about it, and Ghislaine made a joke that I was getting “too old” forJeffrey.He was groping me. He touched my breasts. He touched my ass. He was not my type,but I’d been trained not only to not show my emotions, but to do what [was]wanted.He started licking my toes, between my toes, the arches of my feet.He proceeded to make love to me. . . . He wasn’t rude. It wasn’t like rape, butit wasn’t like love, either. It was more like, “I’m getting my business done.”Andrew didn’t use a condom during their encounter, she claimed: “Jeffrey knew Iwas on the pill.”To wrap up the night, Roberts alleged that she and Andrew took a bath together,and that Epstein paid her $10,000 the following day.There was more horror to come.According to Roberts, there was another, equally terrifying encounter, one thatbegan with the prince arriving “smiling ear-to-ear.”He looked like a kid whose parents were taking him to Disney World. I took himupstairs to the “dungeon.”He was fondling me and we undressed and he lay on the table facedown. I did mynormal routine, which was to start with the feet, up the calves, tickling thethighs, up the buttocks, up the back. On this occasion I don’t think I made itup to his shins when he flipped over.I was just another person he was bedding. He couldn’t have cared less about meas a young woman. . . . He was being treated to sex for which someone else waspaying.From the snickering noises he was making, he was really enjoying the wholething, but I felt like a total prostitute. He never even said, ‘Did you enjoyit?’ I was there for just one purpose.Another young girl under Epstein’s control, Johanna Sjoberg, claimed to havebeen present during that encounter as well, and recounted a grotesque scene:Prince Andrew using a puppet of himself to grope the young girls’ breasts.“He thought it was funny because it was him,” Sjoberg stated in a 2016deposition, obtained in our investigation.During another trip, at Epstein’s private island, Roberts’s description of athird encounter with Prince Andrew was even more debauched.She claimed:A group of Russian girls who didn’t speak a word of English turned up with amodeling agent who was a friend of Jeffrey’s. That night there was a dinner andAndrew was there. He said ‘hi’ to me.Jeffrey directed us with hand gestures because the Russian girls didn’t speakEnglish. We were told to start kissing and touching and to use sex toys on eachother. The girls obviously had been trained. Jeffrey and the prince werelaughing . . . and then they undressed and then I performed a sex act onthem—Jeffrey first and then Andrew. It was disgusting. There was no pleasure init.Prince Andrew left the following night.Buckingham Palace strongly disputes Roberts’s claims, as does Prince Andrew. In2015, a judge ordered them to be struck from the court record in a legal casethat she had filed.“I just wish to reiterate and to reaffirm the statements which have already beenmade on my behalf by Buckingham Palace,” the prince stated at the time, denyingher allegations. “My focus is on my work.”However, certified voice stress expert Michael Sylvestre, who analyzed audio ofAndrew’s statement, concluded the prince showed “extreme” tension while makingthe statement.“He’s lying. Andrew knows the statement made by Buckingham Palace was not true,”Sylvestre claimed.Sylvestre ran the clip through the DecepTech Voice Stress Analysis Machine, acomputerized version of the Psychological Stress Evaluation, which is used bymore than fifty law enforcement agencies in the United States. The test is saidto be superior to a conventional polygraph. The machine senses stress levels inthe voice; frequent “peaks” on the readout indicate that the speaker is beingdishonest.The DecepTech Voice Stress Analysis Machine prints out elevated lines on a chartwhen it detects deception. The readout of Andrew’s evaluation, Sylvester says,is clear: “The deception started pretty much from the beginning. The chart showshe was definitely not reiterating or reaffirming what was said by the palace.”Sharing the same conclusion is body language and speech expert SusanConstantine, who noted that Andrew failed to mention what he was “reiterating orreaffirming”—a sign that he’s trying to deceive.“A deceptive person naturally leaves out incriminating information and won’tspeak of it or put himself into the event. He also refused to describe thesexual allegations,” she said.“Historically, with people who are trying to be deceptive, especially when itcomes to sexual offenses, they won’t name the crime.“A truthful person would say, ‘I did not have sex with the person,’ because theyknow they are innocent.”It wouldn’t be the last statement of denial that Prince Andrew would make inregard to Epstein."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7DIARY OF A SEX SLAVEPrince Andrew wasn’t the only associate of Jeffrey Epstein to cruelly takeadvantage of one of the financier’s teens. By this time, Epstein had developedan entire roster of young, vulnerable, women that he pimped out to his powerfulcontacts as a means of gaining influence and leverage.One of these sex slaves was Virginia Roberts.Like many of the girls targeted by Epstein, Roberts had experienced a roughchildhood: When she was twelve, a close family friend sexually abused her. Shedeveloped an eating disorder and ran away from home and started living on thestreets at age thirteen.Virginia told the story of her dark early years in a secret handwritten diaryobtained by this investigation.“I was on the streets,” Roberts began.There, she wrote: “I was picked up by a 67-year-old man who did exactly whatJeffrey did with me, abuse and violate my youthfulness.”That man—a far cry from the hero he initially seemed to be—was Ron Eppinger,boss of the modeling agency Perfect 10. His business was actually a front forinternational sex trafficking, and he soon made Roberts his personal “employee.”Roberts claimed Eppinger got her hooked on opioids, the highly addictive classof drugs that include heroin, synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, and painrelievers such as oxycodone, Vicodin, codeine, and morphine. Under hisdrug-fueled spell, according to Roberts, Eppinger committed “outrageous acts ofhedonism.”Shortly after her fourteenth birthday, Roberts described, Eppinger “gifted” herto a wealthy client named Charlie, who continued the abuse and degradation.The FBI eventually raided his home, and Roberts’s father arrived to save her.Eppinger later pleaded guilty to charges of alien smuggling for prostitution,interstate travel for prostitution, and money laundering.Reeling from the nightmare, Roberts checked into the Growing Together substanceabuse treatment facility in Lake Worth, Florida.There, the horror continued. Growing Together was “the most controversialdrug-treatment program in Palm Beach County,” Florida’s Sun Sentinel newspaperwrote in a 1990 investigative report. Former patients claimed they experienced“torture” and “brainwashing,” and left with “PTSD like a Vietnam War veteran.” Alater New York Times investigation found “physical and sexual abuse appears tobe common there.”“I still can’t get the screams out of my head from hearing kids dragged down thehall by the hair on their heads,” a former graduate of the program told theBroward Palm Beach New Times in 2004. “The crimes that were committed there havenever been told in public. Nobody has ever put these people on trial.”“Could things like this happen in an institutional setting? Yes,” GrowingTogether Executive Director Pat Allard told the paper, while denying thecharges. “Would it blemish the institution? Yes, it would. Would anyone condoneit? Absolutely not.”The facility later closed.Roberts wrote that she was locked in a “white room” during her stay and thatfights with orderlies were a regular occurrence.With the help of her father and brother, though, she managed to escape. Robertsslowly got back on track and decided to pursue a career in massage therapy. Inthe summer of 1998, she landed a job in the spa at the newly anointed Mar-a-LagoClub—owned by Donald Trump. She was optimistic about the future.While studying at work one day, Roberts was approached by a “striking beautifulwoman” who lived a mile down the street. It was Ghislaine, and she offered thefifteen-year-old a job with “a very wealthy gentleman who was always on thelookout for a new masseuse.”“I agreed,” Roberts remembered, confessing that it sounded like “the legit breakI had been wanting.”The excited young girl told her father about the encounter. Admittedly, he wasskeptical, and a little confused.“I thought it was a job where she was just going to learn massage therapy,” helater said. “That is what she told me. I did not know it was going to be allthis other stuff.”To make sure everything was kosher, Roberts personally brought his daughter overto Epstein’s mansion for the first visit. He discussed the situation withGhislaine, who introduced him to Epstein.“He came across as a nice guy,” her father would claim. “I had no idea what hewould end up doing. If I had known differently, I would never have let her workthere.”Satisfied, the hoodwinked father left Roberts in the hands of the sex predators.Wasting no time, Ghislaine brought the aspiring masseuse to Epstein’s masterbathroom.“Bedazzled by the décor, I shook out of my entranced state and tried not to gawkat the naked man that lay atop a massage table,” Roberts wrote. “I acted calmand cool. [Ghislaine] introduced Jeffrey Epstein as a multi-­billion-dollarbanker and stock broker that took delight in a massage at least once a day.”Ghislaine then showed her the ropes, starting at the toes and working her way upEpstein’s body.“They really had me convinced they were smart, intellectual people wanting tohelp me learn a trade,” Roberts explained.Everything changed, however, when Epstein rolled over. First, Ghislaine took herown top off and briefly pressed her chest against Epstein, Roberts alleged.Next, Ghislaine started undressing the teen, who was too stunned to resist.“I was asked to indulge Jeffrey in oral sex while Ghislaine caressed me frombehind, cupping my small breasts and feeling me inside,” Roberts later describedin one of her secret diaries.“I was inclined to scream out of humiliation for being so damned naïve.”She added:Jeffrey moaned out of delight and pulled up my chin to look at me then guided myhips to sit on top of him. He next forcibly entered me and used his hips togratify his sexual needs. As soon as it was over, I quickly got dressed, and notsure how to keep my composure, just kept quiet. They both thanked me for a jobwell done as I had passed my trial.Epstein paid Virginia $200 for her two-hour session and had an employee driveher home.“I was now a hired prostitute,” she later described.Stuck in a “state of shock,” the embarrassed teenager didn’t dare tell herfather. Her previous confession about the family friend, and her subsequent timewith a sex trafficker, had torn her family apart. She had finally rebounded intosomething “normal.” So when the offer to return to the mansion came in, Epsteinand Ghislaine seemed, at the time, the lesser of two evils.For Roberts, escaping a life as the personal sex slave of the rich and powerfulseemed inescapable.Over the next few weeks, the pair thoroughly abused Roberts under the pretext of“domestic sex slave” training, she wrote.“It was everything down to how to give a blowjob, how to be quiet, besubservient, give Jeffrey what he wants,” she claimed. “A lot of this trainingcame from Ghislaine herself . . . and then there’s Jeffrey who’s telling you, ‘Iwant it this way, go slower.’”(Ghislaine has strongly denied Roberts’s allegations, but she certainly didtrain staffers in some ways. This team obtained a phone message from insideEpstein’s home that recorded a call from Ghislaine. Epstein’s assistant wrotethat the message was “would be helpful to have [redacted] come to Palm Beachtoday to stay here and help train new staff with Ghislaine.”)As for Epstein, however, Roberts was hardly the first victim. She was, though,perhaps the pedophile’s pet project, and soon she became their most sociallyvaluable asset.According to Roberts’s recollections, the trio moved between Epstein’s New Yorkand Palm Beach mansions, where she was given her own luxurious rooms at eachproperty. Their daily activities began to include the use of sex toys, Robertsclaimed, which were kept piled in a laundry basket. Roberts said she also wasinitiated into sadism and masochism, otherwise known as S&M, the practice oftaking or causing abuse during sex.“It was basically every day and was like going to school,” she wrote in thediaries.“You just become this numb figure who refuses to feel and refuses to speak. Allyou do is obey.”Roberts was under the impression that her masters eventually planned to hook herup with one of their rich and powerful friends so she would be “set up forlife.” She had no clue that she would be pimped out as the sexual plaything tomany individuals in Epstein and Maxwell’s social circle.Shortly before Roberts’s sixteenth birthday, she wrote in the diaries, Epsteinand Ghislaine broke the news.“They wanted me to be able to cater to all the needs of the men they were goingto send me to,” Roberts claimed. “They wanted me to produce things for them inaddition to performing sex on men. They told me to pay attention to the detailsabout what the men wanted, so I could report back to them.”When Roberts looked openly confused, Epstein explained to the child that hewanted to “have something on them.” More than just a sex slave, he was nowmaking Roberts a cog in his personal spy wheel.“Epstein specifically told me that the reason for him doing this was so thatthey would ‘owe him;’ they would ‘be in his pocket,’” Roberts alleged.She supposed, “Epstein thought he could get leniency if he was ever caught doinganything illegal, or more so that he could escape trouble altogether.”To get her started, Epstein and Ghislaine sent Roberts to Little St. James with“a professor” and told her to take care of him as she had Epstein, she wrote inthe diary. After receiving a favorable report from the john, the diabolical pairthen continued sending Roberts into the dens of predators around the world. Shestarted making $400 an hour working for Epstein, she wrote, and moved in withhim full-time.“I mean, in some ways, we were a little fucked up family,” Virginia later toldthe Miami Herald. “It was, ‘Jeffrey needs to have sex at least seven times a day. . . but in the meantime, we’re gonna sit back and have some popcorn whileyou’re giving a blowjob and watching Sex and the City. It was just a reallyscrewed up kind of little family unit.”Epstein and Ghislaine took her on wild shopping sprees, had her meals preparedby a personal chef, and even celebrated her sweet sixteen on the orgy island.They also offered to double her salary for recruiting more girls, she alleged.“Jeffrey would send me out to go talk to pretty girls, the younger the better,”Roberts wrote. “I would offer them money to come meet my gentlemen friend andtell them I’d show them how to massage. . . . I never brought back a girl thatever said no, or didn’t want to participate in an erotic massage for money.”Roberts’s diary corroborates the fact that documenting the underage exploits ofthe rich and powerful was a major component of Epstein’s master plan. He hadinstalled security cameras in every room of his properties, and throughout hisCaribbean island. Epstein also employed full-time AV techs to monitor dozens ofvideo feeds.“Kill two birds with one stone Jeffrey thought,” Roberts wrote. “Free porn toshare with his pedophile friends and when the occasion called for it, a securitysystem all at one expense.”Meanwhile, Epstein continued to maximize his assets by sending his Boeing 727into overdrive.“It’s called Lolita Express for a reason,” Roberts wrote. “That was a vessel forhim to be able to abuse girls and get away with it.”Among the men who she claims violated her in Epstein’s mile-high club were TheSimpsons creator Matt Groening (who gave her a personally inscribed sketch ofHomer and Bart); model scout Jean-Luc Brunel (another reported sex traffickerwho could secure passports for minors); cofounder of MIT’s artificialintelligence lab, Marvin Minsky; and former US Senate Majority Leader GeorgeMitchell. (“I have never met, spoken with or had any contact with Ms. Giuffre,”the Maine senator has denied. At the time of this writing, Groening has notissued a public denial. Brunel is missing. Minsky is dead.)As for Epstein’s friend Donald Trump, Roberts wrote that he was a not-unfrequentpresence in their twisted world, but she never saw him indulge: “I didn’tphysically see him have sex with any of the girls. . . . I can’t say who he hadsex with in his whole life or not, but I just know it wasn’t with me when I waswith other girls.” In a later court deposition she even denied that he’d everflirted with her.By late 2001, Ghislaine began shuttling Roberts around in a privately-ownedhelicopter. Even more discreet than the Lolita Express, the helicopter createdstill more opportunities for abuse.In court documents unsealed in July 2019, Roberts alleged that she was forced togive “massages” to then-twenty-five-year-old filmmaker and environmentalistAlexandra Cousteau, the granddaughter of famous French explorer JacquesCousteau.Roberts said that Epstein “instigated that she and I reenact as lovers inlesbian acts of foreplay and penetration” with a strap-on penis.“The allegations by Virginia Giuffre née Roberts regarding Ms. Cousteau are 100percent false,” Cousteau’s lawyer wrote in an email statement soon after thecourt files were released. “Ms. Cousteau never had intimate relations withGiuffre, and does not even recall ever having met such a person.”(Cousteau does have, however, links to one of Epstein’s closest businesspartners: Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Epstein had a framedphoto of “MBS” in his Manhattan mansion and often claimed the controversialSaudi royal had visited his property there many times, these authors can reveal.In 2019, it was reported that MBS ordered the assassination of journalist JamalKhashoggi, nephew of Epstein’s infamous pal Adnan Khashoggi. In September 2019,Cousteau was named as one of the featured speakers at a conference sponsored bythe United Nations and a foundation headed by MBS.)Meanwhile, shortly before Roberts’s eighteenth birthday, it was time for her tomeet Prince Andrew.As Roberts tells it, it was the darkest time of her life. The young girl hadbeen inhumanely used and abused, and had even suffered a miscarriage. She hadn’tknown she was pregnant, she wrote, or who the dead baby’s father was. Epsteinhad promised to cut back her hours if she brought in more girls, she claimed,but the fresh faces only dragged the weary working girl into more threesomes.Roberts would soon age out of Epstein’s preferred bracket—women fourteen toseventeen. According to Roberts, though, they still could make use of her.“Ghislaine starts talking to me about how I would feel about having a child,”Virginia recently alleged, claiming that she was offered $200,000 a month and ahouse in exchange for the baby.The idea terrified her. After years of being emotionally, physically, andmentally degraded, Roberts had reached rock bottom. She began plotting herescape.Roberts managed to convince Epstein and Ghislaine to send her to Thailand insearch of legitimate massage training. Epstein agreed under one condition: thatshe bring back “a Thai girl.”In the summer of 2002, Roberts fled to Thailand, where she met and fell in lovewith martial artist Robert Giuffre. Newly empowered and determined to begin herown life on the other side of the world, the girl made one final call to hercaptors, Ghislaine and Epstein.“He said, ‘Have a nice life,’ and hung up,” Virginia said of her brief goodbyephone call with Epstein. “I thought, ‘I’m off the hook, I’m off the chain, I cango, I can live free.’”Roberts and her new man eloped, moved to Australia, and started a family.Still, despite her wish for freedom, the nightmare wasn’t over.In 2007, while pregnant with her second child, Virginia claimed she received acall from Ghislaine.“I was like, ‘How the hell did she just find me?’” Roberts wondered. “‘I’ve beenout of their lives for so long.’”According to Roberts, by then going by the name Virginia Giuffre, Ghislainewanted to know if she had “talked to anybody.” The former sex slave informed herthat she hadn’t, she claimed. Seemingly satisfied with her answer, Ghislaineordered her to “stay quiet.”“The next day Jeffrey calls me, with his lawyer on the phone, and he asks me thesame questions,” Giuffre recently alleged.Concerned, the new mother wondered what was going on. The next day, the FBIcalled and asked about her sexual history with Epstein. She demanded the officerverify his employment.“About six months later, I get a knock at the door and it’s the AustralianFederal Police,” she said. (The Australian Federal Police is like the FBI, thenational and principal federal law enforcement agency.)Officials gave her a detailed document about what Jeffrey had done, and howshe’d been identified as a victim: “Jane Doe #3.”Remarkably, more than nine thousand miles from Epstein and Ghislaine, she wasstill so frightened by the long-arm of the lawless pedophile, she refused toassist the officers.Little did she know that a massive investigation was unfolding across the worldin her home state of Florida—one that could finally bring Epstein to justice."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8DONALD TRUMP AND THE PALM BEACH PEDOPHILEPalm Beach in the late eighties and nineties was the perfect playground for aman like Jeffrey Epstein: decadent, debaucherous, and deeply corrupted.“I spent a lot of time in Palm Beach at that time,” said Maxwell family friendLaura Goldman.She continued:Palm Beach is a live-and-let-live kind of place. Lots of rich libertarian types.I don’t think that they mixed with their neighbors, because they didn’t wanttheir neighbors to know what they were doing. I think the police force downthere is pretty ineffective. We’ve seen that they are. I think that people arethere on vacation, they didn’t want to rock the boat.I spent a lot of time in Palm Beach at that time. I’d been to their house onBrillo Way. It was kind of not my scene and there were lots of young ladies.Even though I was much younger then, they were even younger than me, and Ireally couldn’t compete in that scene.Now I feel bad because I got a sense that something was off. I didn’t really payattention to what was off. Now, when I see what’s happened to all these girls, Ifeel incredibly terrible that I didn’t ride by more often, like a bike crusader,and stop it.Everybody knew that he was looking for young girls. But I didn’t realize, one,that they were young, that young, and I didn’t realize that he was traffickingthem. But it doesn’t surprise me that the Palm Beach police looked away.People don’t understand about Palm Beach in the nineties and at that time, therewas no South Beach. So, Palm Beach was where all the decadent people went. ThePalm Beach police kind of looked the other way.I visited with other people Jeffrey Epstein’s house in the late nineties. Inoticed that it wasn’t the grandest house on the block, but it was the mostprivate.Another visitor, Epstein’s former attorney Alan Dershowitz, told thisinvestigation’s reporter, Jen Heger, that the home held many secrets.Insisting he knew nothing of Epstein’s illegal escapades, Dershowitz described,“In his house in Palm Beach, there were two stairways. One of them, you were notallowed to go up.”“He had locked doors,” Dershowitz continued. “I was never in that part of thehouse. The same thing is true in his house in New York.”Those doors were finally opened, however, during a later police raid on thehome. After years of relentlessly hounding the local authorities, these authorswere able to obtain the official video. The following is a description of itscontent:Many guests entered the home through the kitchen, a bright and airy space with ablack and white checkered floor and cozy bar stools around the island. Headingthrough there to a back staircase, however, it got literally darker.Carpeted in lilac and bound by white walls, the staircase spiraled up to theupper level, home to several bedrooms, bathrooms, and of course, the massageroom.It all begins innocently enough. At the top of the staircase is a landing withpink carpeting and a comfy pink couch. There’s a photograph of palm trees andthe ocean.Turning left, you enter a den of several tiny bedrooms—rooms scarcely big enoughto hold both a bed and a dresser, but bright and bedecked with cheap art. Innearly every room, the only item of clothing to see was a white robe. In anotherbedroom, there was a teddy bear.Moving back across the landing and to the right, the atmosphere changes. First,there is an antechamber of sorts, a dark room with chairs, similar to a waitingarea. On the wall, a close-up photo shows hands tightly gripping someone’s leg,fingers digging into the flesh. On another wall hung a photo so graphic it wasthe only image blurred from the police video. [Attorney Spencer Kuvin wouldlater tell our team that one of his clients, a victim of Epstein, remembered onephoto “of a young girl who could have been no more than twelve or thirteen yearsold with her panties pulled down around her ankles bent over.”] Dominatinganother wall was a 3-D rendering of a woman’s torso, seen from the back, and cutoff just below and above the rear end. The curves protrude inches from the wall.Moving deeper into the next room, that same rear view is re-created in apainting. Another painting shows a nude woman lying down with her legs spread,dark pubic hair at the center of the frame; her breasts, very small.Moving deeper still: the massage room. Immediately upon entry, there is a largeink drawing of Ghislaine smiling softly and looking toward the massage table, asif she presides over what would happen there. Below her, a small model airplanecalls to mind the Lolita Express. At the back of the room, the massage table.There are oils, lotions, and a large vibrating “massager” (later described bymultiple victims as an instrument of sexual assault). More stacked towels, morehanging robes. His bedroom is nearby.In Epstein’s personal quarters, the “art” becomes even more disturbing. Onephotograph captures a wet woman in the shower, from behind. A line drawingdepicts a naked woman’s torso from the side. Yet another, directly from thefront. Yet another, a naked woman curled in the fetal position. Not far away,stacks of personal stationery bearing his name.In a closet filled with men’s clothes, dozens of small, personal photographs areframed, collage-style on the walls. Most show young women. Most of them aretopless. There’s also a picture of Epstein and a brunette standing in front ofthe United States Presidential Seal, in what appears to be the White Housebriefing room.Still more candid photos of female companions bedeck the walls of his personalgym, downstairs and off the pool. One image shows a blonde toddler, missingteeth, grinning into the camera as she climbs out of a pool. Another, a blondetoddler in a dress. Still another, a young blonde girl with no pubic hairstretched out naked and apparently unconscious on a beach. An extremely tightcloseup of a female rear end.Tucked away in the gym bathroom, there is a photo of an arrogant-looking man—notEpstein. Featured in our photo insert, the man has an amber, almost orange hairsculpted into a perilous combover. His hand, rather small, is raised casually inthe air as his elbow rests on the arm of his chair. He wears a billowy,ill-fitting button-down and slacks, staring pompously, with his lips pursed,into the camera. Behind him, a young brunette in a white tank top stands withher hands just above his shoulders, as if she was in the midst of giving him amassage. Behind her, another young brunette returns the favor, massaging thefirst girl’s shoulders as well. Behind the second brunette, a blonde in thechunky black sandals popular with nineties teens grins at the camera whilemassaging the second girl. A four-way massage, as only Epstein couldorchestrate.Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein were close friends during that heady Palm Beachera.“I’ve known Jeff for 15 years,” Trump told New York magazine in 2002, placinghis first connection with Epstein in 1987, two years before he would step footon Robert Maxwell’s Lady Ghislaine yacht.“He’s a terrific guy,” Trump continued. “It is even said that he likes beautifulwomen as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.” If he believedthat, why didn’t he report Epstein to the police? Perhaps he didn’t think thegirls were that young. Or perhaps it was because he was, in some form, Epstein’swingman.In the early nineties, following Trump’s divorce from Ivanka Trump, the two wereconstant companions.A recently unearthed archival video from 1992, recorded by NBC News, shows thetwo pervy playboys whispering and laughing, surrounded by women at Trump’sMar-a-Lago—the same place from which Virginia Roberts had been recruited. Nextto them was an editor for the National Enquirer, Larry Haley, who was reportedto have been assigned full-time to the Trump “beat” for the scandal sheet.In 2000, Trump and Epstein were photographed attending an event on the sameproperty with Prince Andrew and Trump’s wife Melania.According to insiders, Trump had full privileges at Epstein’s Palm Beach home,as well. He’s since denied ever being close with Epstein, but attorney SpencerKuvin, who represents one of Epstein’s victims, claims the evidence suggestsotherwise.“We knew from deposition testimony that we took in the civil cases from a few ofthe people that work within Mr. Epstein’s home that Donald Trump was more thanjust a casual acquaintance of Mr. Epstein,” he told reporter Doug Montero.We knew that because even on one occasion, we were aware that Mr. Trump had cometo the house and stopped by and just ate in Mr. Epstein’s kitchen. And just satthere, and chatted, and ate in the kitchen with him. So, this was more than justa casual acquaintance. This was somebody that he knew and that they spoke withone another, they socialize with one another.We also knew that Epstein and Trump had gone to parties together at Mar-a-Lagothat Mr. Trump had arranged. We knew that one of the victims that came forwardand accused Epstein of essentially turning her into a sex slave was found atMar-a-Lago originally, she was working there, and that’s where Epstein got herfrom.So, we also know through stories that have come forward now from two young girlsthat were sisters that were in the New York area, that Mr. Trump had stopped byMr. Epstein’s New York home on occasion as well. So as far as high-profilefriends, we certainly knew that Mr. Trump was a close friend of Mr. Epsteinduring those exact years that Mr. Epstein was molesting these young girls. . . .These are two gentlemen that definitely ran in the same circles.Later, Epstein’s flight logs would show an entry for Trump on the LolitaExpress. Not only was his phone number found in Epstein’s little black book; butalso, more than a dozen additional ways to contact him.After Epstein’s crimes became public, Trump attempted to distance himself. Hereportedly barred Epstein from Mar-a-Lago in 2008, and said in 2019, “I knew himlike everybody in Palm Beach knew him,” insisting, “I was not a fan.”Indeed, during those years Epstein was an inescapable and infamous figure inPalm Beach, one who made little effort to conceal his dark deeds from friends,acquaintances, and even strangers. Although few were invited upstairs or intohis more personal quarters, his home was small, and the images could easily havebeen discovered.As Epstein threw raucous parties for Palm Beach’s elite, was he toeing the line,taking some small thrill from the possibility of being exposed? Or was he usingthe sexual images and young women throughout the property as bait?Kuvin told Montero: “We had heard that Mr. Epstein had created videos ofhigh-profile individuals inside of his home and kept them as insurance. Andmaybe he had provided women to some of these individuals, or young girls.”Maxwell family friend Laura Goldman attended one such debaucherous party at thePalm Beach mansion, and was disturbed by what she found.“There was a bar in Palm Beach in the nineties called Chuck & Harold’s,” Goldmanexplained. “It’s not there anymore. Somebody there invited me to the party. Mostof the crowd at that place at the bar scene were old Palm Beach, Wall Streetersand that kind of people.”She continued:The reason I went to Jeffrey Epstein’s house in the first place was the rumorwas that he was throwing wild parties. Nobody knew who he was, really, at thattime because it was before he took Bill Clinton on his plane. I thought, “Oh,well, let me check this out!” Then I got there and I thought, “Maybe I shouldn’tcheck this out.”I noticed there were some drugs around. I noticed girls. And I noticed a lot ofmarried men that didn’t seem to be there with their wives, which is sort of whyI’m not mentioning who was there . . .In the nineties, drug use wasn’t quite as common on Wall Street as it is now, oras open. I noticed at the party that people were wandering off to private roomsand God only knows what they were doing in there: drugs, women, whatever.So I said, “Oh, maybe this isn’t the party scene for me.”Many of Epstein’s party guests never could have guessed that what happenedduring the daytime at the house on El Brillo Way was even more disturbing.In 2005, a mother called Florida’s Palm Beach Police Department, frantic,claiming that her fourteen-year-old daughter had been enticed to Epstein’snearby mansion. There, the woman claimed, the teenager was paid $300 to strip toher underwear and massage the fifty-two-year-old. Her secret had been discoveredwhen school administrators found the cash on her after a playground fight.On her word, Detective Joseph Recarey launched a year-long undercoverinvestigation into Epstein and exactly what was happening behind the walls ofhis mansion. What he found was worse than even the seasoned investigators couldhave imagined.Ultimately, they spoke to thirty-four victims. The girls’ stories were chillingin their similarity.In a buried videotaped police victim interview we obtained, one skinny andskittish young woman reveals the horrible secret she’d been hiding for years.“Every girl that meets Jeffrey starts off with giving him a massage,” she said.“The more you do with him, the more you make. Basically, if you take off yourclothes, you’re going to make more. If you let him do things to you, you’regoing to make more.”“By do things, you mean touch you?” a detective asked.“Yes, touch you in inappropriate places,” she answered. “I did it naked, but Iwouldn’t let him touch me or anything like that. So after that, he says, ‘Youknow what, listen, I’ll pay you $200 for every girl you bring to me.”“It was like a train,” she said. “I brought my friends, they brought theirfriends, and it went on and on.”“Did Jeff know anybody’s real true age or he didn’t care?” a detective asked.She said, “I don’t think he cared. He told me the younger, the better.”A cache of police victim interview videos obtained by Epstein: Devil in theDarkness reveals a chilling detail. Police entered the videos into evidencemarked with the victims’ birthdates. Recorded throughout 2005, the anonymousdates are a haunting reminder of just how young Epstein’s victims were, evenyears after their abuse by Epstein:6/1/868/09/8612/30/869/21/8612/30/862/8/876/6/876/18/876/30/8710/10/872/29/883/8/884/19/884/21/887/28/88One young victim recruited for Epstein by a high school friend wassixteen-year-old Michelle Licata. Licata spoke to our reporter MarjorieHernandez, describing the horror of El Brillo Way.“Life before Jeffrey Epstein was football games, cheerleading competitions,”Licata said. “When I met Jeffrey Epstein I was, I think about sixteen years oldand I had just started a job at Publix. I was a cashier. I was trying to getinto a different crew of friends that I wanted to hang out with. . . . There wasa girl that I went to high school with and she was part of that group.”Licata continued:I can’t remember what class we were in, but she was sitting right next to me.She was writing me a note. She asked if I wanted to make some extra money forChristmas. Having seven brothers and sisters, I thought that this is going to bethe year that I’m going to get everybody something. That’s exactly what I wantedto do.She was writing me a note and said, “Do you want to make some extra money?” Iwas like, “Yeah! I mean, how do you do that?” She said that she’s done it andthat you just massage old guys. I was like, “Okay.”I was like, “Do you have to have a license, like a massage license to do that?”She said no. Then she said, “But if you tell anybody, I will kick your ass.” Iwas like, “Okay.” I didn’t understand why she’d want to beat me up if I saidthat. Maybe she was embarrassed because she had to massage old guys, likewrinkly old men. That’s the vision that I had in my head. Maybe that’s why Iwasn’t supposed to say anything. She took the note and crumpled it up and threwit away.I was working at Publix at the time and she came picked me up. Then she startedto take me down to Palm Beach. . . . When we started going down there, I waslike, “Well this would make sense. It’s where rich people live. She said you canmake some money. That’s where you would go.”What I had envisioned in my mind was completely different than what was about tohappen. I realized it when we pulled into someone’s driveway. I was thinking itwas going to be like a building or a facility or something where there’s massagetables, but it was not like that at all.I remember her just saying, “If somebody asks just say that you’re eighteen. Idon’t think that they’re going to ask, but just say that you are.” I was like,“Okay.” Once again still thinking that it’s . . . You have to have a massagelicense. Maybe you had to be the age of eighteen to get that license? That’s theway that I was thinking about it.We walked in through the back door. . . . There was a lady, I think two ladiesthat walked in behind us. One kept on walking past and then one was there andshe was telling me, “Hi. I’m so-and-so.” I don’t remember her exact name. Shehad a clipboard in her hand. She looked like this model, really beautiful, tall,skinny blonde girl. . . .She told me to write down my name and my number on the counter. . . . Then she’slike, “I just want you to come follow me.” . . .We walked out of the kitchen and we’re going up this staircase. It was like halfa spiral staircase. She was just prepping me to go into this room and she wastelling me, “So the temperature’s going to be cooler, Jeffrey’s going to be inthere. He’s going to be making some phone calls. There’s going to be somelotions on the counter. Just go ahead and start massaging him and just listen towhat he says and what he wants you to do and just go ahead and do that.” I waslike, “Okay.”I went in there and there was . . . Like she said there was lotion set up on avanity. There was already money sitting out.Jeffrey Epstein came in and he introduced himself. He asked me what my name wasand I told him, “Hi, I’m Michelle.” He looked like he was about to get on thephone and just go and do business, make phone calls.When he came into the room, he had on a towel and that was it. He had it wrappedup around him and he just walked in. He still had on the towel when he waslaying on his stomach and he just got onto the phone. He said there’s lotion andhe set a timer. There was a timer on the table and he set that. He was asking meto . . . He got on the phone.He was like, “Just go ahead and massage my feet.” Every once in a while, “Goahead and massage my calves. Go ahead and massage this and that.” I was likeokay, this seems to be normal. This would be a massage like any normal place.Then he got off the phone and he started talking to me.That’s when I knew this was going to go wrong. When he started asking me verypersonal questions about my sex life. He was asking me how many guys I’d everbeen with. Do I have a boyfriend? You look so beautiful.You’re fighting back and forth like, “I don’t understand what’s really going on,but this old man is telling me to do things.” Then also you don’t really knowwho is this person, who is he? Does he have a gun? Is he going to kidnap meright now and lock me up in some kind of basement?Then on top of it, putting his hand on my hip and spinning me, like, “Do a spinfor me. Let me see what you look like.” It’s like okay, but you’re not reallysure if you said no, what would happen? That’s what I was afraid of is if I sayno, am I going to be killed?What are my options for getting out of this room alive? Because so far, my mindhas been wrong since pulling into a house and a driveway it has gone wrong. Itjust keeps getting worse and worse. We’re not at this place that I thought we’regoing to be going to. There’s one person and now he is looking at me. Now he’sgetting into a place into my head that is a very personal place. He is digging.He is digging in . . . That to me is worse than what he could do or touch me.He took this really private place and he turned it into a nightmare for a reallylong time. It still haunts me. . . . I mean, here I am. I wrote down in myplanner that I stayed on the phone until 4:00 in the morning with a boy. That’swhat I thought was just so awesome. Then to have or I think I wrote, I kissedso-and-so. I mean, that’s where my mind was. That’s the level of sexuality thatI was at.At this point I was in my bra and my underwear and I remembered the bra becauseit was one particular bra that I ever had really that was like that. It clippedin the front. He had popped it off. He just kept telling me he liked that and todo that. It just got more just grabby and turning me and looking at me. I justkept thinking if that timer could just hurry up, I would just really love to getout here. . . .He knew that I was uncomfortable. He continued anyways. He was really going totown on himself. He kept going and then at one point he just, I guess finishedand he jumped up, wrapped his towel around him. He said, “Okay, thank you. Iwould really love to see you again. There’s $200 there for you. Your number andyour name make sure it’s downstairs before you go. I will call you and have youcome back.”I was just thinking, “Oh my God, you’ve got to be kidding. You’re out of yourmind. You’re out of your mind if you think I will ever be here again in myentire life.”I just went back downstairs. . . . I guess my friend saw the terror on my face.I was just freaked out and she said, “What happened?” I was like, “I will tellyou in the car. Just get out of here right now. I want to go home.”We got in the car and she’s like, “What?” I was like, “He was trying to fingerme and stuff.” She’s like, “That’s it? That’s not a big deal. He tried to dothat with my last friend.”I was like, “What’s your last friend? How many people have you brought?” It waslike this feeling of just being used as someone’s play toy. I just put mysunglasses on and I looked out the window. It was like forty-five minutes’ driveback to my car.I was just crying without her knowing the whole way home. I was just thinkingabout, I don’t know. How’s anybody ever going to love me?Ashamed, Licata told only her very best friend what had happened, and tried tomove on. A year later, she got a visit from the police.“I was seventeen, and some men in some black suits showed up at my house,” shetold Hernandez. “My brother answered the door and he was like, ‘Michelle there’ssome men in black suits looking for you. Why?’ I was like, ‘I have no idea.’I went out there and I was talking to them. They said, “Do you know JeffreyEpstein?” I was like, “No.” I thought it was some kid. I thought some kid diedin school.They kept talking and I’m trying to think of like, “Was I doing something inhigh school?” I was still thinking, “Who did I hang out with at school that mayhave wanted to hurt themselves or kill themselves?” and I was like, “What’shappening?”Then they said Palm Beach. It all just came back, rushed all through my body.I was just like, “Oh my God. I was like, I’m in trouble. These men have found meand I’m going to go to jail.” I thought I was going to jail.I met up with them in a parking lot, which is still really sketchy, in a parkinglot right next to my work. We’re in their car and they had a recorder and theywere recording me.They didn’t explain a whole lot, just like, “Well this has happened to othergirls. It’s okay you can tell us what happened.” There wasn’t any like, “Hey,let’s get together. Why don’t you come down to the station while we do this?”You would think any normal police investigation would be like fingerprints orsomething, or I don’t know what their goal was that day, but it didn’t make mefeel safer to talk to them.The police, when I was talking to them and in the car with them, they were justasking me what happened. They just wanted to know what I knew. What informationI had. Do I remember anybody that was there? How did you end up there? They justasked me to tell my story to them as to what happened.Apparently it was because there was one girl that came out and actually saidsomething. I think she told her mom, and her mom brought it to the police’sattention. Then because Jeffrey Epstein had a bunch of names and phone numbersand stuff that he had in his possession, and I think they found something ofthat nature and that’s how they could find the girls. Because they told me thatthey found my name and my phone number in his house. They wanted to ask me somequestions about what was happening there.I recently just listened to the recording from that day. I remember justsounding so terrified that I was in trouble. That I was so young, I was such alittle girl still when I was saying stuff. I was like, “So he was masturbating.”You could tell I didn’t even really know the right words were to tell these men,these once again older men, that were recording me in a car, in a parking lot.That happened.Then I think the FBI sent a lady to come meet up with me and we spoke togetheras well in the parking lot of a hospital. She recorded our conversation. It wasjust her and I, then I redid the story.After I gave my statement to the Palm Beach police department and the FBI agentI was never contacted again by the law and by the justice system. I was neverkept up to date as to what was going on.It’s like this really long process of literally nothing happening. It is likewe’re talking about this guy, we have all this evidence of what he’s been doingand yet how many years has it been going on, and how long has literally nothinghappened, nothing.After a yearlong investigation, police had completed interviews with dozens ofgirls like Michelle. Detectives even picked through Epstein’s trash anddiscovered incriminating messages on scraps of paper documenting phone calls.“She is wondering if 2:30 is OK . . . She needs to stay in school,” read onedocument obtained during the course of our investigation.Another slip of paper suggested that Epstein had had a bouquet of roses sent toone teen at her high school following a school performance.An Amazon packing slip addressed to Epstein that we obtained reveals he’dordered some seriously disturbing reading material: Slavecraft: Roadmaps forErotic Servitude, Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves,and SM 101: A Realistic Introduction.Was his sexual exploitation confined to young girls? A piece of note paperobtained by cops and recovered by our team shows that someone jotted down theurls “TonyaWorld.com [http://TonyaWorld.com]” and “Trannsvicious.aol.com[http://Trannsvicious.aol.com].” The former is still live at the time of thiswriting, featuring “T-Girls from All Over the World,” “Ethnic SheMales,”“Thousands of SheMales,” and “Direct Contacts” for the models on the site.Armed with such details from their surveillance work, the police finally got thego-ahead to raid the home on El Brillo Way.A Palm Beach Police Department incident report obtained by the authors of thisbook describes the scene in Det. Joseph Recarey’s own words:As we entered onto the property, we encountered the house manager, JanuszBanasiak, who was in the guest portion of the house. . . . The members of thePolice Department entered the house and announced we had a search warrant.Several interior decorators were located on the property. I spoke with MarkZeff. . . . Mr. Zeff stated he is the designer for Mr. Epstein’s homes. Headvised he was contacted in March of 2005 to do a complete overhaul on thehouse. He advised he was on the phone with Mr. Epstein when officers announcedthe search warrant. Mr. Epstein was then made aware of the search warrant. . . .I entered the residence and located two covert (hidden) cameras. The firstcamera was a covert wall clock in the garage area. I traced the wire behind theclock and removed the RCA wire and unplugged the camera. The other covert camerawas located within a desk clock beside Epstein’s desk.”Detective Joseph Recarey had actually been inside Epstein’s home before: back onOctober 5, 2003, when Epstein accused “a former disgruntled houseman” ofstealing money from the house. He described what his team expected to find inhis October 18, 2005, Affidavit & Application for Search Warrant, obtained bythis team: “I observed several covert cameras, which would capture and recordimages of anyone within the residence. Epstein had purchased covert cameraswhich were built in wall clocks and table clocks. These images were thendownloaded onto a proprietary spyware software for later viewing.”Recarey noted that Epstein “told me that he had purchased a spy camera from astore on Okeechobee Blvd. and had set up the camera which was in a clock in hisoffice.”Indeed, when they got permission and raided the home on October 20, 2005, theyfound a trove of files and recording materials. Evidence logs obtained by thisteam catalog the haul: * 12 phone message books, filled with names and messages from his famous friends * 3 file folders of similar messages, ripped off of pads * 1 bag of shredded paper, found in his office * 1 orange folder marked “Massages” * More than 123 photographs * 4 VHS tapes * 2 CDs marked “Happy birthday” * 63 CDs * 1 DVD * 16 Zip CDs * 12 8mm video tapes * 5 memory cards, as would be used in a digital camera * 11 floppy disks * 1 zip drive * 3 computer CPUs * 1 Maxell CD-RThey also found other items that hinted at the depravity the house had hosted: * 4 massage tables * 1 black framed photo of a nude girl * 1 green framed photo of a nude girl * 2 twin torpedo vibrators * 1 bottle of joy jelly * 3 X-rated videotapes: Sex In City, Eat in Janine, and I Love Lesbians Four * Penis- and vagina-shaped soaps * 1 school transcriptStill, something seemed off. Epstein’s pals, interior decorator and architectDouglas Schoettle were there when the raid occurred, and seemed unperturbed. Thematerials they managed to get their hands on weren’t a slam dunk for conviction.Some of Epstein’s recording devices and computers had been removed, cords lefthanging when cops arrived. Had Epstein been tipped off?“The place had been cleaned up,” former detective Michael Reiter later told NBCNews.Still, by May 2006, Detective Recarey believed the case was bulletproof.Recarey amassed a Probable Cause Affidavit filled with damning evidence againstEpstein. The official document even included a description of Epstein’sdistorted genitalia.“It was thick towards the bottom but was thin and small towards the headportion,” a victim said, calling it, “egg-shaped.”Another victim told cops it’s “like a teardrop.”“It’s really fat at the bottom and skinny at the top,” she continued, makingreference to “some sort of birth defect on his thing.”But once the case got into the hands of the higher ups, the case did not proceedhow the cops were expecting.According to Reiter, Epstein’s high-powered defense team, which included KennethStarr and Alan Dershowitz, seemed to know details about the cops’ case evenbefore they emerged. (Starr was best known for heading an investigation ofmembers of the Clinton administration; Dershowitz for serving on the legal“Dream Team” alongside Johnnie Cochran and F. Lee Bailey in the 1995 O. J.Simpson murder trial.)“We believed that the content of our probable cause affidavit eventually, sometime after we presented it to the state attorney’s office, ended up with thedefense attorneys,” Reiter said.“Because minute details that nobody else knew that were in those documents werebeing refuted and contrary information provided by the defense.”Furious, Reiter demanded that the state attorney, Barry Krischer, remove himselffrom the case. That didn’t go anywhere, so Recary brought the Department’sevidence to the FBI.When it became clear that the federal probe would encounter similar roadblocks,Reiter arranged a meeting with the prosecutor in charge of the case, US AttorneyAlex Acosta: President Trump’s future secretary of labor.Acosta put on a good show. Reiter said, “I left that meeting thinking, ‘This guyhopefully is going to do his job.’”Reiter would be wrong."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/InsertA1-01.jpg]Epstein’s unassuming home on El Brillo Way in Palm Beach was the site of hisworst abuses.

I understand you may have information on a case that we’relooking into.Victim: I’m not gonna get in trouble for anything I say, right? . . .P: How do you make money with Jeffrey?V: There’s two ways. . . . Every girl that meets Jeffrey starts off with givinghim a massage. The more you do with him, the more you make. Basically, if youtake off your clothes, you’re gonna make more. If you let him do things to you,you’re gonna make more . . . touch you in inappropriate places . . . He uses hishands, and I wouldn’t really call it a vibrator, I guess like a massager. I didit naked, but I wouldn’t let him touch me or anything like that. My friend toldme that she knew a girl that slept with him and made $1000.So after that he’s like, “You know what? I’ll pay you $200 for every girl thatyou bring to me. I don’t want you to massage me anymore, just bring girls tome.”So for every girl that I brought to Jeffrey, I would make $200.He would tell me make sure these girls know what to expect, what they want.Because when I get into that room, they need to know.[One girl] came to me saying she needed money. . . . I basically told her aboutit and she was like, “Um what do you have to do?” I told her, I was like, “Themore you do, the more you make.”You’re gonna take your clothes off. But the more you do, the more you make.She gave him a massage and she basically let him like touch her, down there . .. When she got in the car I was like, “How much did you make?” and she said,$300, and I just knew right then that she did more. I asked her like, “What didyou do?” She’s like, “Well I started doing the massage and my clothes came off,and he put his fingers inside me.” . . .P: How old were you when you were approached to go see Jeffrey?V: Umm . . . 16 or 17.P: How many girls have you brought to him?V: Oh . . . a lot.P: Who else was underage?V: What do you mean, like under 18? All of them.P: Did Jeff know anybody’s real true age, or did he care?V: I don’t think he cared. He told me, the younger the better. I tried to bringhim a woman who was 23 and he didn’t really like it . . .Police Victim Interview BV: It was in high school, everybody was trying to make money. I had two jobs.P: Do you have any formal massage training?V: No . . . It seems really weird, the whole situation. There were more girls inthe house. And then we just go upstairs it was a massage room and he came likeyou know and I give him a massage.P: Did you recall anything weird when you were going up the stairs?V: The pictures.P: Pictures of what?V: Naked people . . .V: I sit down there and she tells me, “Just wait a second.” So she comes backand we put down the little bed for the massage. And she’s like, “OK there’s somelotion and he’ll be right out.” So he comes in and says, “OK . . . just amassage.” He took his clothes off, and he was in like a towel.P: At any point did he ask you to remove your clothes?V: Yeah. And I say no. [sic]P: So you continue with the massage?V: Yeah. It was kind of weird I guess.P: How much did he pay you?V: $200.P: During the time that you’re massaging him on his chest, is he touchinghimself?V: Yes . . . Well you know he started getting a little excited. And he startedtouching himself and I told him to stop.P: You mean by touching himself, you mean he was masturbating?V: Yes. He like had his hand under the towel. . . .P: He offered you more money to get naked?V: Yes. Well, he told me just to take my shirt off. I was just scared that hewas going to do something.P: Did you ever get naked while doing the massages?V: Once, but it was in my underwear. It was never completely naked. I thinkthere was one where I took my bra off, but that was it. He offered me more moneyif I have [sic] sex with him, and I said that’s never gonna happen. It’s notwhat I’m gonna do for money.P: Did he offer you more to do more things?V: Yah. $100 more just to take my shirt off. He tried to talk to you just tomake you comfortable with the situation. Like go where are you working. How muchdo you make at your work. He starts saying you can make more with me. I didn’tfeel like it was right.Police Victim Interview CV: She took me over to the house. She waited downstairs. I just went upstairsand gave him a massage and that was it. She’s like oh do you know do you need tomake any extra money. . . . This older guy in Palm Beach, he gets a lot ofmassages from girls. He asked me to take my shirt off, so I took my shirt off.P: So, were you in a bra or were you topless?V: I ended up being topless, yeah . . . for a while I was doing it like once aweek for a few months. Probably somewhere around there . . .P: Did you ever take your panties off and be completely nude?V: Every now and then yeah.P: He touch himself?V: Yes . . . he would masturbateP: Did you ever bring anybody to the house?V: Yes I did. Neither one of them wanted to go back though.Police Victim Interview DV: I was short on rent one month and she told me all I had to do was give him amassage and he would give me $200. . . . I thought about it and I was like Ireally need the money. I asked my parents and they couldn’t give me the money. Iasked everyone I knew. So, I went there, and I gave him the massage and it was aweird situation.P: Did you provide the massage with clothing on?V: All I had was underwear on. She did not tell me that. I was absolutelysurprised when I got there. I knew nothing. He had a towel over his privateparts and he was just laying on a table and I was just massaging from the kneedown for about 45 minutes . . . ten minutes before we were getting ready toleave he asked her to leave because we were in the room together, and he askedme to massage his chest and he had the towel on. And about 5 minutes into it hetook the towel off and started pleasing himself, which I was very uncomfortablewith. Like I wanted to leave right when I got there.I’m sorry I don’t like thinking back on it, it was so . . .When he started pleasing himself he got up and went over to a drawer and hepulled out this vibrator thing and then he pulled down my panties . . . it waslike this stick with a knob on it. He didn’t like stick it inside me but he putit on me.He just got up and walked out. He’s like, “OK you can put your clothes on,” andhe closed the door. After he walked out and when I went out, I went downstairsand he was down there and there were like there other girls there. I guess theystayed there or something.P: Did he say anything to you while you were doing the massage?V: He was talking about art and everything like that and you know just thepaintings on the walls that he had and stuff like that. The whole situation wasodd. Before we even got out of the car when we just pulled up she said, “Don’tsay anything. Don’t speak unless you’re spoken to.” So I was like, “What thehell are you getting me into?” So, I didn’t say anything and there werepictures, pencil drawings of naked people. It looked really weird. . . . I am soashamed that I did that because it’s not like me . . .Police Victim Interview EV: I told her that I didn’t want to be left alone with someone because I wasmolested when I was 12, so just like me being alone like right now I’m kindauncomfortable and I told her that like I’m not going if you’re not gonna bethere with me and I was unaware that I was gonna be alone with him for that tenminutes and I thought I was gonna die . . .Jane Doe #1: An anonymous victim who spoke in court against Epstein on August27, 2019, seventeen days after his death.“I still feel like I am learning the ways that he’s impacted me.“Even though Jeffrey Epstein brought it to a grand scale, on some level, a lotof girls could relate to the trauma we are talking about.”Jane Doe #2: An anonymous victim who spoke in court against Epstein on August27, 2019, seventeen days after his death“I think each of us has a different story and different circumstances for why westayed in it, but for me, I think he was really strategic in how he approachedeach of us. Things happened slowly over time. It was almost like that analogy ofa frog being in a pan of water and slowly turning the flame up.“A lot of us were in very vulnerable situations and in extreme poverty,circumstances where we didn’t have anyone on our side.”Jane Doe #3: An anonymous victim who spoke in court against Epstein on August27, 2019, seventeen days after his death“My world kind of spiraled after that. I stopped going on modeling castings. Igained weight. I became depressed. I stopped going out with my friends. And onlyfive months after I had been in New York City to pursue my dream, I left. I leftthe modeling industry, I left New York City, and I totally switched my careerpath.”Jane Doe #4: An anonymous victim who spoke in court against Epstein on August27, 2019, seventeen days after his death“We will always carry irreparable damage and pain throughout our lives afterthis. It’s something that’s never going to go away. Whoever we marry in ourlife, whatever future we have in our life, it’s always going to be somethingthat’s always there for us.”Jane Doe #5: An anonymous victim who spoke in court against Epstein on August27, 2019, seventeen days after his death“You paid for your freedom. You violated my rights. You should have to pay forthem, just as anyone else. You got a plea deal no one else would have been ableto get. You used your money to get out of paying the price for your actions.”Jane Doe #6: An anonymous victim who spoke in court against Epstein on August27, 2019, seventeen days after his death“Jeffrey Epstein stole my innocence. He gave me a life sentence of guilt andshame. I do not consider myself a victim. I see myself a survivor.”Jane Doe #7: An anonymous victim who spoke in court against Epstein on August27, 2019, seventeen days after his death“I used to be relatively carefree, inquisitive, hopeful, and excited about life,but my life changed because of Jeffrey Epstein. My perspective on life becamevery dark when I was unknowingly recruited by one of his agents. Jeffrey Epsteinruined me.”Jane Doe #8: An anonymous victim who spoke in court against Epstein on August27, 2019, seventeen days after his death“I cannot say that I am pleased he committed suicide, but I am at peace knowinghe will not be able to hurt anyone else. However, the sad truth remains. I,along with other people, will never have an answer as to why. I will never havean apology for the wrongdoing. And most importantly, Epstein will not be justlysentenced for his crimes.”Jane Doe #9: An anonymous victim who spoke in court against Epstein on August27, 2019, seventeen days after his death“When I was fifteen years old, I flew on Jeffrey Epstein’s plane to Zorro Ranch,where I was sexually molested by him for many hours. What I remember mostvividly was him explaining to me how beneficial the experience was for me andhow much he was helping me to grow.“I remember feeling so small and powerless, especially after he positioned me bylaying me on his floor so that I was confronted by all the framed photographs onhis dresser of him smiling with wealthy celebrities and politicians.”Jane Doe #10: An anonymous victim who spoke in court against Epstein on August27, 2019, seventeen days after his death“Epstein targeted and took advantage of me, a young girl, whose mother hadrecently died a horrific death and whose family structure had deteriorated. Hisactions placed me, a young girl, into a downward spiral to the point where Ipurchased a gun and drove myself to an isolated place to end my suffering.”Jane Doe #11: An anonymous victim who spoke in court against Epstein on August27, 2019, seventeen days after his death“He promised me that he would write me a letter of recommendation for Harvard ifI got the grades and scores needed for admission. His word was worth a lot, heassured me, as he was in the midst of funding and leading Harvard’s studies onthe human brain, and the president was his friend.“I had never even kissed a boy before I met him, and never throughout thehorrific abuse did Jeffrey Epstein kiss me even once. When he stole myvirginity, he washed my entire body compulsively in the shower and then told me,‘If you’re not a virgin, I will kill you.’ And then I wasn’t a virgin anymore.”Jane Doe #12: An anonymous victim who spoke in court against Epstein on August27, 2019, seventeen days after his death“They told me to go upstairs and directed me to Jeffrey Epstein’s office. Mr.Epstein had a white robe on and we chatted very briefly. I had my portfolio ofphotos, but he didn’t even look at it. Suddenly, he took his robe off and gotclose to me. I got up to leave, but the door was locked.”Chauntae Davies“I began my massage, trying not to let him smell my fear and obvious discomfort,but before I knew what was happening, he grabbed onto my wrist and tugged metowards the bed. I tried to pull away, but he was unbuttoning my shorts andpulling my body onto his already naked body faster than I could think. I wassearching for words but all I could say was, ‘No, please stop,’ but that justseemed to excite him more.”Marijke Chartouni“She told me he went to Cooper Union. He was a mathematical genius. That he hadfavorite girls that he would take to Chanel for fifteen-minute, all-you-can-buyshopping trips. She told me his right-hand person had connection to the arts andthe fashion world, and she could help me.”Jennifer Araoz“He robbed me of my dreams. He robbed me of my chance to pursue a career Ialways adored. He stole my chance at really feeling love because I was so scaredto trust anyone for so many years that I had such severe anxiety. I didn’t wantto leave my house, let alone my bed.“The fact that I will never have a chance to face my predator in court eats awayat my soul. Even in death, Epstein is trying to hurt me. I had hoped to at lastget an apology, but this evil man had no remorse or caring for what he did toanyone.”Alicia Arden“He was touching my hips and my butt, and wanting to lift my skirt up. He saidhe wanted to manhandle me. I filed a police report but I really wasn’t takenseriously. My family, my friends discouraged me because I wasn’t physicallyraped. I was assaulted, he was touching me and taking my clothes off, and I feltif I didn’t get out of there it could’ve been worse.“So did it need to be worse? Did I need to be raped for anyone to take meseriously?”Teala Davies“I was going to start this statement by saying that I was a victim of JeffreyEpstein. But that’s not the case. I’m still a victim of Jeffrey Epstein. I’mstill a victim because the fear of not being heard stopped me from telling mystory for so many years. . . . I’m still a victim because I am fearful for mydaughters and everyone’s daughters. . . . I’m still a victim because theseventeen-year-old Teala was manipulated into thinking she had found someone whocared, someone who wanted to help.”Courtney Wild“Jeffrey Epstein robbed myself and all the other victims of our day in court toconfront him one by one, and for that he is a coward.”Anouska De Georgiou“Something I think is very important to communicate is that loss of innocence,trust, and joy that is not recoverable. The abuse, spanning several years, wasdevaluing beyond measure and affected my ability to form and maintain healthyrelationships, both in my work and my personal life. He could not begin tofathom what he took from us.”Michelle Licata“What happened to me occurred many years ago when I was in high school, but itstill affects my life. I was told then that Jeffrey Epstein was going to be heldaccountable, but he was not. In fact, the government worked out a secret dealand didn’t tell me about it. . . . The fact that I mattered this time and theother victims mattered is what counts.”Theresa J. Helm“That experience for the last seventeen years has been a dark corner in mystory. . . .

We are survivors, and the pursuit of justice should notabate.”Annie Farmer (Speaking on behalf of her sister Maria Farmer)“Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell not only assaulted her, but as we’rehearing from so many of these brave women here today, they stole her dreams andher livelihood. She risked her safety in 1996, so many years ago, to reportthem—to no avail—and it is heartbreaking to her and to me that all thisdestruction has been wrought since that time.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10“HE’S INTELLIGENCE”More than “34 confirmed minors” had found the bravery to share the details oftheir darkest nightmares with strange men in police uniforms. Jeffrey Epstein’semployees had stood up to share what they knew, even though their livelihoodswere at stake. The Palm Beach Police Department had put together one of thestrongest and most jaw-dropping cases in recent memory, proudly passing it offto prosecutors.Then, there was a fumble. Or more accurately, an entirely new play began tounfold behind the scenes.United States Attorney Alex Acosta had personally assured Detective Reiter ofthe Palm Beach Police Department that he was on the case. The only problem,Acosta said, was that he’d simply been stymied in his efforts to bring Epsteinto justice by the maneuverings of his legal team since delivering thefifty-three-page indictment that charged him with grooming, paying, and coercingunderage girls to have sex with him.Victory for the victims was still in their grasp, but Acosta had his own plans.In October 2007, the Miami Herald reported, Acosta secretly met with one ofEpstein’s attorneys, Jay Lefkowitz, over breakfast at the Marriott in West PalmBeach. Amid vacationers and traveling businessmen, they struck one of the mostoutrageous sweetheart deals of all time.According to the sentencing document obtained by this team, Epstein would: 1. Plead guilty to minor felony state charges of “Procuring a person under 18 for prostitution.” 2. Epstein and “any potential co-conspirators” would be immune from such charges moving forward. 3. Epstein would agree to register as a sex offender.According to the sentencing document, the nature of Epstein’s charges would haverequired a “lowest possible prison sentence” of 21.5 months. Instead, thatdocument showed Epstein would serve twelve months in prison and ten months ofprobation. A box was checked noting that this was a “mitigated departure,” or adecision to impose less severe penalties than the sentencing guidelinesrecommended. Ultimately, the final sentence was eighteen months.The facts of that plea deal are by this point in time widely known. What mostpeople don’t realize, however, is that Palm Beach County prosecutors actuallyhad offered Epstein another plea deal back in 2006. An even sweeter deal, itwould have helped him avoid grand jury proceedings and jail time altogether,likely sweeping the entire investigation under the rug. The plea deal, issued ina letter from Assistant State Attorney Lanna Behlohlavek to Epstein’s attorneyGuy Fronstin and obtained by this team reads:By this letter, I am confirming the offer of settlement to your client, JeffreyEpstein. Should you accept this settlement, the state will not proceed withGrand Jury proceedings tomorrow.Plea to Aggravated Assault with the Intent to Commit a Felony, a third degreefelony.Adjudication will be withheld, and your client will be placed on 5 yearprobation with the following conditions: no contact direct or indirect withvictim [redacted]; no contact with minors unless supervised by an approved adultwith knowledge of the underlying facts, but in no case shall the supervisingadult be [assistants] Nadia Marcinkova or Sarah Kellen; psycho-sexual evaluationand successful completion of any recommended treatment . . . ; full payment ofthe costs of the investigation by the Palm Beach Police Department; and mayapply for early termination of probation after three years if there are noviolations.Epstein rejected the deal. What part of that list of demands was too much forhim? Was he confident at that time that he’d skate entirely?Even when he was finally sentenced to prison, in 2008, he seemed nonplussed bythe whole situation. Relaxing on Little St. James at the time, Epstein told aNew York Times reporter that he fancied himself a real-life Gulliver,shipwrecked in a world that was so much smaller than he was.“Gulliver’s playfulness had unintended consequences,” Epstein said. “That iswhat happens with wealth. There are unexpected burdens as well as benefits.”“I am not blameless,” he admitted. Although his lawyers insisted Epstein wasunaware of the girls’ ages, he claimed he’d taken steps to ensure noimproprieties would take place in the future.He told the Times he’d hired a full-time, male masseur to replace his roster ofteens. He said he’d assembled a “board of directors of friends to counsel him onhis behavior.” Considering the behavior of his “friends” at that moment intime—and that they were essentially the coconspirators that allowed him to getaway with the worst of crimes—one could make a reasonable case that wasn’t thebest idea.Heading off to prison in Miami, Epstein confessed he was “anxious” butconfident: “Your body can be contained,” he told the reporter, “but not yourmind.”In yet another sign of his arrogance, he set his email to auto-reply, alertingfriends that he was “on vacation.”In truth, Epstein’s time behind bars would be more of a retreat thanretribution. To start, he was not sent to federal prison like most sex offendersin the state. Instead, he was given a private wing at the Palm Beach CountyStockade Facility, where he enjoyed the care of his own personal securityguards.Even then, remarkably, he spent little time within the confines of the jail.Just over three months into his sentence, Epstein was granted work release,allowing him to leave the premises for up to seven days a week, up to sixteenhours at a time. That period included up to two hours at his Palm Beach sex den.In principle, it was shocking. In practice, it was illegal. Florida lawprohibits anyone who has committed three violations in five years from beinggranted work-release. Epstein pleaded guilty to charges involving one victim.But in 2018, the Southern Florida Assistant US Attorney, Maria Villafaña,announced that she’d found “inaccuracies and omissions” in Epstein’swork-release file, claiming that he had actually made three violations andtherefore should not have ever been given release.What’s more, of more than twenty inmates on work release at that time in thesame prison, Epstein was the only sex offender.Disturbingly, he could have used that time to commit even more crimes. SouthFlorida’s Sun Sentinel newspaper reported that they found more than one instancein which Epstein was not under the direct supervision of guards. What’s more,there is no record of who visited him when he was “working” at a nondescriptWest Palm Beach office building, because those logs have been destroyed.There are records, however, of who visited him in prison. Although a departmentmemo had barred Epstein from seeing “family members, girlfriends, children,friends or minors,” there are recorded visits by Sarah Kellen and NadiaMarcinkova. Both women have been identified in federal court as two of hispotential “co-conspirators.”Kellen, who sometimes goes by Sarah Kensington or Sarah Vickers, was describedas the “lieutenant” in one lawsuit, just below Ghislaine in the chain ofcommand. In multiple lawsuits, she has been accused of scheduling girls for sexsessions with Epstein in his Palm Beach mansion. The involvement of Marcinkova,who later used the last name Marcinko, is somewhat curious. Police records showthat investigators had indications that Marcinkova might have been underageherself when she became involved with Epstein and declined to answer questionsabout the sex scheme when she was deposed in a lawsuit, invoking the FifthAmendment. Her lawyers later said she was one of his victims.Miami Herald reporters Sarah Blaskey and Nicholas Nehamas found that Epsteineven made a prison commissary purchase that seemed like a likely gift for aguest: two pairs of small women’s panties, size 5. Too small to fit an averageadult woman, however, they certainly weren’t for Kellen or Marcinkova. . . .As for all crooks, Epstein found, there was a workaround that could make life inprison tolerable: Corruption. Epstein paid a pretty penny for his privileges.According to records obtained by these authors, one of his nonprofitorganizations paid $128,000 to the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Department tocover the cost of his personal detail. They were even known to refer to him as“the client” instead of as “the perp.”Ultimately, Epstein—one of the sickest sex fiends to ever walk the planet—onlyserved thirteen months before he was released on “good behavior.”Overall, it was outrageous. At the time of this writing, the Florida Departmentof Law Enforcement is conducting an investigation into how his case was handled.Florida State Senator Lauren Brook was one of the forces behind the inquest.“Epstein enjoyed an unprecedented and deeply troubling level of leniency andluxury while incarcerated,” she said. “We need answers if we wantaccountability.”So, who was responsible for Epstein’s incredible, once-in-a-lifetime sweetheartdeal?Then–US Attorney Alex Acosta has insisted it wasn’t him. Acosta was asked abouthis role in the debacle while being vetted by Trump’s transition team, beforetaking up his position as Secretary of Labor. He insisted he’d only had onemeeting about the deal, according to reporter Vicky Ward—a claim that matchesthe Miami Herald’s reporting on the West Palm Beach Marriott breakfastrendezvous.Acosta had “been told to back off,” because Epstein was “above his paygrade,”Ward wrote, that “Epstein ‘belonged to intelligence’ . . . and to leave italone.”But exactly who was the “intelligence” agency pulling the strings? Epstein’splea deal mysteriously hinted at the “valuable consideration” he’d been givenfor information he’d provided to federal prosecutors behind the scenes. Thenature of that information has never been made public, and many assume that itis connected to his work as a federal witness in the prosecution of individualsconnected to the 2008 collapse of his former employer, Bear Stearns.However, also in 2008, several of Epstein’s famous associates were involved ineven more pressing international crises.George W. Bush was entering the final months of his oversight of the bungledIraq War, and Britain was one of the country’s last remaining allies as part ofthe much-fêted Coalition of the Willing, referring to the US-led Multi-NationalForce in Iraq. Surely, he had reason to keep Epstein quiet, and to preventPrince Andrew’s name from being dragged through the mud in a highly publicizedand scandalous trial.In addition, former pal Bill Clinton’s wife Hillary was in the midst of herfirst presidential campaign. Epstein’s Palm Beach pal Donald Trump had even comeout to support her, calling her a “wonderful woman” who would make a greatpresident. As for Trump, he had just launched Celebrity Apprentice, and wasriding high in his new career as a reality television star.Also in 2008, Mohammed bin Salman had finished college and was launching hispolitical career in Saudi Arabia by joining the Saudi Cabinet.Notorious Saudi arms trader Adnan Khashoggi was in the midst of a reputationoverhaul. “Selling an image,” the New York Times reported at the time, “heprefers these days to be remembered as ‘Mr. Fix-It’ rather than the arms dealerinvolved in the Iran-Contra scandal.”All of these people would have had an incentive and motivation to keep the peacewhen it came to Epstein—and what he knew.“Epstein was sort of flying very important people around the world, providingyoung girls for some of them,” said author Martin Dillon, after conversationswith sources in the Mossad. “Building files. It’s how the intelligence serviceswork.”“They call it the honey trap,” Dillon said, referring to the time-honoredintelligence practice of spies using the lure of sex to entrap targets. “Butit’s much more sophisticated than that.”The honey trap—or “love trap,” as it is sometimes known—has a long and salacioushistory in American espionage. According to a 1975 Washington Post report, “Foryears, the Central Intelligence Agency operated love traps in New York and SanFrancisco, where foreign diplomats were lured by prostitutes in the pay of theCIA.”“Through hidden one-way mirrors, CIA agents filmed the sexual adventures andlater tried to blackmail the victims into becoming informants.”The article noted, “The CIA possibly got the idea from the Russians, who havelong used sex blackmail to entrap Westerners into spying for them.”CIA reps told the Washington Post reporters that they “had never heard of this.”But for Epstein, the playbook was already written.Dillon explained:If you’re an intelligence community, and you have someone like Epstein, who’skind of a celebrity, who can attract celebrities, who can be in part ofconversations about world events about the most secret things. If you could putpeople like Clinton on his planes and you can put Ehud Barak, a former PrimeMinister of Israel and a former general, then he is a guy who really matters toyou.If he is going to be your friend, he is going to work for you. He is going to bean asset for you. Look what he can do. He can give you information on all thosepoliticians; on their private behavior, their peccadilloes, all these things areimportant to intelligence communities.Former CIA counterterrorism specialist Philip Giraldi said he also has “littledoubt” that Epstein was running an intelligence operation, and that hisknowledge helped him escape justice.“There is no other viable explanation for his filming of prominent politiciansand celebrities having sex with young girls,” Giraldi wrote in the AmericanHerald Tribune in August 2019. “Epstein clearly had contact with former IsraeliPrime Minister Shimon Peres and Ehud Barak and [Epstein’s client Leslie] Wexneralso had close ties to Israel and its government.”In addition to flying on the Lolita Express, former Israeli Prime Minister EhudBarak also visited Epstein at his Manhattan home. In January 2016, he wasphotographed entering the property, followed by four young women soon after.“I was there, for lunch or chat, nothing else. So what?” said Barak in astatement when the visit was reported. “I never attended a party with him. Inever met Epstein in the company of women or young girls.” He also admitted tohaving visited Little St. James, but said he did not attend any parties or seeany young girls there either.According to Giraldi, former Palm Beach County state attorney Barry Krischeralso may have been responsible for swaying Acosta in 2008, behind-the-scenes.Krischer had won the prestigious Anti-Defamation League (ADL) Award ten yearsbefore. (The ADL is a US-based Jewish organization with a long history ofdomestic spying allegations.)“The Jewish state regularly tops the list for ostensibly friendly countries thataggressively conduct espionage against the US,” Giraldi claimed. “Mossad wouldhave exploited Epstein’s contacts. . . . Those blackmailed would undoubtedly inmost cases cooperate with the foreign government involved to avoid a majorscandal.”Fallen into the hands of the American justice system in Florida, he could haveprovided information far more explosive than whatever was happening at BearStearns.Indeed, Epstein’s attorney Kenneth Starr at one point went over Acosta’s head toRepublican appointees at the Department of Justice, demanding that they drop thecase. The attorney general in 2008, who likely would have received the request,was Michael Mukasey—an Orthodox Jew with such deep ties to Israel, that he hasbeen accused of having dual citizenship.In retrospect, it’s clear that Epstein’s blackmail files were at the heart ofhis epic sweetheart deal. It wasn’t just the contents of those files that hisfriends and enemies wanted kept quiet, however. It was the fact that the dealitself seemed most dangerous.As part of the plea deal, Acosta and his team agreed to try to keep the detailsof their arrangement out of the press. The New York Times covered Epstein’ssentencing in a fluffy report set on his “palm-fringed Xanadu in the Caribbean.”“To prosecutors, Mr. Epstein is just another sex offender,” reporter LandonThomas Jr. insisted, despite all evidence to the contrary. Epstein “admits” that“his behavior was inappropriate,” Thomas wrote—perhaps in the understatement ofthe century. The article even featured tough talk from a member of Acosta’s teaminsisting that Epstein would get no house arrest, a claim that Thomas apparentlydid not question.It was later revealed that Thomas had asked Epstein for a $30,000 donation tohis favored charity. After the donation was uncovered, Thomas left the New YorkTimes under a cloud of controversy.Even worse than the media secrecy that surrounded the deal was the fact that itwas deliberately hidden from the victims. A letter from one of Epstein’sattorneys to Acosta makes the plot clear: As part of the plea deal, Acosta wouldbe barred from informing “any of the identified individuals, potential witnessesor potential civil claimants” about the details or even the existence of theagreement.Spencer Kuvin was an attorney representing several Epstein victims at the time.He described how he and his clients were kept in the dark to veteran crimereporter Doug Montero.“I’m in the courtroom and Mr. Epstein pleads guilty,” Kuvin recalled.” At thispoint, we still don’t know on behalf the victims what he’s pleading guilty to.We don’t know how long he’s going to stay in jail, we don’t know what thenon-prosecution agreement that he entered into says, what it says for thevictims, what it says about him, what charges he’s admitting to or what is thestandard of all of the allegations that he’s admitting to at the time. He’s justwhisked off and that’s it.”He continued:We go back to our offices and I call the US Attorney’s Office and they stilldon’t give us any information. They don’t tell us what he pleaded guilty to,they don’t even tell us that there’s a non-prosecution agreement. I learnedabout it later, on behalf of my client through, again, a source that tells me,‘Hey, did you know that there’s a document out there that’s a non-prosecutionagreement that you should get ahold of because it effectively talks about yourclients and certain victims that he’s pleading guilty to.As attorneys, there were about four or five of us at the time representingvarious different victims to get ahold of this non-prosecution agreement. Mr.Epstein’s lawyers fought us and wouldn’t produce it, refused to produce theagreement. We had to go to court and over a period of a year, this is one yearafter the federal government enters into an agreement with Mr. Epstein to notprosecute him, essentially having him plead guilty to the same exact chargesthat these girls have accused him of.We, on behalf of the victims still don’t have the agreement and the judgefinally orders that it be produced to the victims. They then, on behalf of Mr.Epstein, appeal that decision from the judge. So we still don’t get a copy of ituntil it goes through the appellate court system, which lasts another six toseven months before we finally, ultimately get ahold of this deal.We see when we open the deal and take a look at it, that it gives immunity tonot only Mr. Epstein but also his coconspirators, some which are specificallynamed. Then in the language of the document, it includes any and all potentialother coconspirators in this non-prosecution agreement.So the federal government enters into a deal, which essentially gives not onlyMr. Epstein immunity but all of the other people that potentially could havebeen coconspirators bringing women or girls to his home. It was an unbelievabledeal.We had never seen something so broad before, we had no idea why they would enterinto such a deal. What was the motivation? Why would you give this man such adeal like this?You know, if this had been Joe Plumber working in Palm Beach and had abused oneminor, two minors, he could be sitting behind bars for sixty to seventy years.This is a man that had abused probably over forty young girls, and now you’regiving them this deal and giving immunity to all those coconspirators? It justnever made any sense.None of it made sense. The speed with which they entered into the deal, thebreadth or the scope of the investigation, which, by the way, didn’t even gooutside of Palm Beach at the time. For some unknown reason, the US Attorney’sOffice, Mr. Acosta, decided to keep it within Palm Beach. It just never made anysense.The only thing that we could think on behalf of the young girls was that maybeMr. Epstein had traded information and given the federal government informationthat nobody knew about, that they weren’t telling us. . . . But we never knewbecause they wouldn’t tell us, and they wouldn’t tell the victims.In this case, it seemed, silence was golden. But who would benefit from Epsteinkeeping his mouth shut?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11THE HUNT FOR JUSTICEMonths and even years after the sexual assaults that changed their lives,Epstein’s victims stood in the shadows, trying to move on with their lives whilealso awaiting the justice that would allow them to do so—justice that wouldnever comeAttorneys like Spencer Kuvin who had stood by them through the investigationbegan to help them file civil suits in an attempt to find some kind of closure.“After the FBI conducted all of their investigations, and talked to all of theseyoung women, by then, some of these women had actually come forward and decidedto go ahead and file civil lawsuits against Mr. Epstein,” Kuvin said “I wasretained by not only that first victim, but also two other girls who werecourageous enough to step forward and file a suit against Mr. Epstein.”“When the first cases were resolved, the young girls were extremely upset at theway that the US Attorney’s Office handled that case,” Kuvin explained.” Really,they kind of felt revictimized by the system itself, by the US Attorney’soffice, because nobody seemed to care about them.”“I think that’s why they really focused as much as they did, because they knewas attorneys on their behalf, we were fighting vigorously to get Mr. Epstein andto get admissions out of him and to conduct investigations. We were deposingunder oath his house manager and the police chief and the lead investigator andhis cook and his pilot and him. You know, the US Attorney’s Office wasn’t doingthat. We were, on behalf of the victims.”Indeed, Epstein had been able to evade a trial, but it was in the civil casesthat he had to answer tough questions for the very first time, leaving prison tosit for uncomfortable depositions that were recorded on tape.“I took Mr. Epstein’s deposition twice,” Kuvin said. “On the first occasion thatI took his deposition, as I walked in the room, he really attempted as best hecould to maintain eye contact. He had a big grin on his face, always lookedsmug.”He continued:You got the feeling that he always felt as though he was the smartest man in theroom but yet he always wanted to try to ingratiate himself and be friendly witheveryone that was around.He had two lawyers protecting him during the deposition that I took. The firstone, his criminal lawyer and his civil lawyer, they sat there objecting toquestions constantly, while Mr. Epstein would just sit back and smirk. He’d lookover to them during questioning if he was concerned whether he should assert hisfifth amendment right or just go ahead and answer questions.He would periodically answer questions that he knew were insignificant, that hecould talk about, like where he may have gone to school or where he grew up.While at the same time objecting to other questions that were basic such as“what’s your address in Palm Beach” that he thought may be able to incriminatehim.I asked him, in his first deposition, the most significant question right at thebeginning: whether or not in fact his private parts were the shape of an egg? Hesmirked almost to the point of a laugh.His lawyers became indignant, and then he got up and walked out of a deposition.After that, I went to court and filed a motion for sanctions against him forwalking out on me and the judge granted my motion for sanctions and awarded me$800 for the time I spent having to go back and take a second deposition of him.In the second deposition, I asked even more salacious questions of him which henever agreed to answer. Questions about sex toys that were found in his bedroom,massage oils found in his bedroom, women that he either knew, places he hadgone, things he had done, sexual positions. And the goal of all that was to seeif I could get him angry, or upset, or throw him off to where he would actuallyspurt something out that could incriminate him.Having said that, during the entire time, all he would do is just smirk, smile,sit back in a very creepy way, and just read a prepared statement that hislawyers would give him regarding his Fifth Amendment.After the whole thing was said and done, from both the first and the seconddeposition, I guess the best way to describe it is just creepy. This was a guythat when you got in a room with him, after you left the room, you felt like youneeded to take a shower.I met him a third occasion at a mediation where we resolved some of the casestogether, and he was there along with his lawyers. And during that process hereally took over and wanted to talk about how . . . Well, put it this way, hetook over the discussions and not his lawyers. And he, I think, always felt asthough he was the smartest man in the room even beyond his own legal team.But even on that occasion, I can’t recall ever reaching across the table andtrying to shake the man’s hand. Even though he was an adversary on the otherside of the case, he always seemed to want to try to be friends with everyone.Saying, “How are you? How are you doing?” And, “Nice to meet you.” And it wasjust as though he could not get out of that routine of trying to make everyonehis friend.Eventually, Kuvin’s civil cases were settled and the victims involved gotundisclosed payouts. The cash did not, however, buy their silence; they werefree to discuss the case and the allegations at will moving forward. It was justthe exact amount of their settlements that were kept quiet.Kuvin explained, “On behalf of the victims, we wanted to protect the girls,frankly, because we didn’t want friends or people outside of litigation knowingwhat type of money these young girls may have gotten from Mr. Epstein.Obviously, with money comes hangers-on and other people that may be involved intheir life and property. So we kept the amounts confidential to protect thegirls as much as anyone else. But the facts of those settlements, they wereallowed to talk about to anyone they chose to talk to.”Bradley Edwards, another high-profile victims’ attorney, later admitted in courtdocuments that his three clients had received a total of $5.5 million insettlements.Still, it wasn’t entirely a happy ending for anyone involved. During the courseof that litigation and the police investigation that had preceded it, Kuvinclaims, Epstein’s team had gone all out on the girls, with rough-and-tumbletactics designed to exploit their every weakness and perhaps intimidate theminto silence, adding insult on top of the many psychological injuries they hadalready suffered.“I was followed,” one Epstein victim, who asked not to be identified, told theseauthors. “I received death threats on the phone. The life of my daughter wasthreatened, and at one point, a car tried to run me off the road. I am convincedEpstein was behind it all. He wanted to frighten me into not cooperating.”Kuvin recalled, “I can tell you that in representing the victims of Mr. Epstein,and going through some of the litigation, and seeing some of the hard-nosedtactics he had against my clients, having them followed by his privateinvestigators, having black trucks drive up to their house and quickly driveaway or sit outside their home, having his investigators interview people intheir families, looking online at all of their backgrounds and information. As alawyer on behalf of those clients, there were days where I definitely walked outto my car and I would remote start my car. Call it a hunch, call it a fear, callit just good practice. It was definitely something that concerned me.”“As far as the victims, I can tell you more so the parents than victims werevery angry,” he continued. “And as a parent myself, I can tell you that I wouldhave had my own personal thoughts about what I would want to see happen to Mr.Epstein outside of the court system.”Indeed, court documents obtained by this investigation show that Epstein’sattorneys trolled the victims’ social media pages for “evidence” of improprietythat they then submitted in the case in order to impeach them as witnesses. Forexample. attorneys circled and starred innocuous posts by the young girls, poststhat would later be used against them.Victim Michelle Licata, who filed a civil suit against Epstein, told reporterMarjorie Hernandez that the experience was like psychological warfare.It was really weird. It was me going back and forth from where I lived toFlorida and meetings psychologists. It was Jeffrey Epstein’s psychologists andpsychiatrists and therapists. They were asking me a lot of questions and then Ihad to go to my own therapists and my own psychologist.Then I had depositions on cameras with his lawyers and my lawyers. I felt it waslike a cat-and-mouse game. Let’s see how long we can keep her mind going whilewe figure out some kind of sweetheart deal.They were asking me questions about things that had happened in my life. Theywere talking to me about, “So you don’t think that this was very traumatic inyour life and that’s probably why you’re so ‘screwed up’?” Pretty much, that’swhat they were saying. “These little things that happened in your life, youdon’t think that’s the reason for why you are angry at the world?”That’s when I got on to his lawyer about what he does. I was like, “If you thinkthat what happened to me in my life compares to anywhere near to what hashappened with me and your client,” I was like, “you’re crazy.” Making those twocomparisons, no. This is why I’m messed up in my life. Stop talking to me aboutthose things. They were trying to do exactly what Jeffrey Epstein did.They were trying to go into your subconscious, into your mind and try and findyour weak spots, and try and see what they could use against you in the court oflaw. These people were giving me thick books and packets of lawyer talk and Ihad to fill out these questions about “how many people have you slept with? Nameevery single person you’ve ever done anything with?”I called up my lawyer. I was like, “Kissing or sex?” And she said they want toknow every single person. I’m like, “And what does this word mean? What’s adeposition?” I was still nineteen years old not knowing what was going on.They went after just me. They were trying to make me look bad against myself, totry and make me feel like I wasn’t credible. I was like, “No, I wasn’t a hooker,and no I wasn’t a stripper.” I mean, I was in high school. I was friends withthis girl that brought me there. I mean, what are you expecting to find? “Whendid you start sleeping with these guys?” I’m like, I mean do you want dates orwhat do you want from me? I don’t know.It was a nightmare. This whole process is a never-ending nightmare. I just wishthat somebody would do something and shut it down and get it done and over withand let everybody have their lives back.But the fight for justice was far from over. Almost immediately after Epstein’ssecret sweetheart deal was exposed, two victims filed a lawsuit against the USgovernment itself.Identified only as Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2, the plaintiffs were two victimswho claimed that the federal government had not notified them of Epstein’s pleadeal—a violation of the Crime Victims Rights Act. That law, passed in 2004,grants all victims the right to prior notice of any court proceedings in theircase, as well as the right to appear and speak at any hearing, as appropriate.In Epstein’s case, neither right had been granted.Perversely, the government at first tried to argue that the CVRA did not apply,because federal charges against Epstein had never been filed due to the verysame plea deal they had covered up. The court firmly rejected that position.Since the non-prosecution agreement at issue had prevented any future federalcharges against Epstein, a judge ruled, the victims did have legal standing tocoverage under CVRA. With that established, the judge deferred any judgment asto whether they were entitled to relief or damages until more evidence could begathered.At that time, in 2015, two more victims attempted to join the case: Jane Doe #3and Jane Doe #4. This team broke the story: The new victims claimed that sincetheir circumstances were so similar to the first two plaintiffs, adding them tothe case would cause little delay. What’s more, in new court documents, the twovictims made even more explosive claims.Jane Doe #3, later revealed to be Virginia Roberts Giuffre, took aim atGhislaine Maxwell:In 1999, Jane Doe #3 was approached by Ghislaine Maxwell, one of the main womenwhom Epstein used to procure under-aged girls for sexual activities and aprimary co-conspirator in his sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme.In fact, it became known to the government that Maxwell herself regularlyparticipated in Epstein’s sexual exploitation of minors, including Jane Doe #3.Maxwell persuaded Jane Doe #3 (who was then fifteen years old) to come toEpstein’s mansion in a fashion very similar to the manner in which Epstein andhis other co-conspirators coerced dozens of other children (including Jane Doe#1 and Jane Doe #2).When Jane Doe #3 began giving Epstein a “massage,” Epstein and Maxwell turned itinto a sexual encounter, as they had done with many other victims.Epstein then became enamored with Jane Doe #3, and with the assistance ofMaxwell converted her into what is commonly referred to as a “sex slave.”Epstein kept Jane Doe #3 as his sex slave from about 1999 through 2002, when shemanaged to escape to a foreign country and hide out from Epstein and hisco-conspirators for years.From 1999 through 2002, Epstein frequently sexually abused Jane Doe #3, not onlyin West Palm Beach, but also in New York, New Mexico, the US Virgin Islands, ininternational airspace on his Epstein’s private planes, and elsewhere. Epsteinalso sexually trafficked the then-minor Jane Doe, making her available for sexto politically-connected and financially-powerful people. Epstein’s purposes in“lending” Jane Doe (along with other young girls) to such powerful people wereto ingratiate himself with them for business, personal, political, and financialgain, as well as to obtain potential blackmail information.Filed in the last hours of 2014, the documents were incredibly explosive—and werushed to parse them. Roberts clearly, emphatically, and unemotionally accusedEpstein, Maxwell, and their coconspirators of doing the kinds of things thatonly had been whispered about for years.At the time, police had not released files or videos to us, and we had fewdocuments that described the horrors Epstein had committed in the victims’ ownwords.It was a new level of disturbing.What’s more, for the first time, Roberts unleashed on Prince Andrew:Jane Doe #3 was forced to have sexual relations with this Prince when she was aminor in three separate geographical locations: in London (at GhislaineMaxwell’s apartment), in New York, and on Epstein’s private island in the USVirgin Islands (in an orgy with numerous other under-aged girls).Epstein instructed Jane Doe #3 that she was to give the Prince whatever hedemanded and required Jane Doe #3 to report back to him on the details of thesexual abuse.Maxwell facilitated Prince Andrew’s acts of sexual abuse by acting as a “madame”for Epstein, thereby assisting in internationally trafficking Jane Doe #3 (andnumerous other young girls) for sexual purposes.“Epstein also trafficked Jane Doe #3 for sexual purposes to many other powerfulmen,” the court filings claimed, “including numerous prominent Americanpoliticians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-knownPrime Minister, and other world leaders. Epstein required Jane Doe #3 todescribe the events that she had with these men so that he could potentiallyblackmail them.”Indeed, in the years after Epstein was released from prison, hisinformation-gathering and blackmail system went into overdrive like neverbefore. Despite the fact that he was a convicted sex felon, still facinglawsuits and allegations in Florida, the highest levels of society stood waitingto welcome him back from prison with open arms.Epstein walked right into them."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12THE SMARTEST MEN IN THE WORLDAfter Jeffrey Epstein’s arrest and the subsequent flood of lawsuits, he wasconsidered radioactive in the political realm. Bill Clinton and other bold nameson D.C.’s Beltway and beyond insisted that they’d had no idea what Epstein wasdoing with the young girls around him; the implication being, now that theyknew, they would never talk to him again.However, one of the most prominent Lolita Express passengers didn’t seem to mindbeing linked to and even photographed with a sex felon: Britain’s Prince Andrew.In what now seems like a catastrophic misstep that launched the most sensationalscandal in Buckingham Palace history, Prince Andrew remained a public ally ofthe convicted pedophile even after his release from prison. The Prince was aguest of honor at Epstein’s Manhattan “welcome home from prison” bash when hefinished his sentence in 2010.Organized by an old-school publicist, Peggy Siegal, the event had a star-studdedguest list of New York’s elite. Did they know exactly who was hosting the party?Among those who joined Epstein and Andrew that night were news anchor KatieCouric, talk show host Charlie Rose, comedian Chelsea Handler, filmmaker WoodyAllen, and President Clinton’s former senior advisor, George Stephanopoulos.Just a few months before, Siegal had organized another high-society event at themansion: A Yom Kippur dinner for 120 people—including their children.Despite Epstein’s sex offender status, he and Prince Andrew seemed chummier thanever in 2010. They were photographed strolling together through Central Parkduring one visit, and Andrew was even caught on video poking his grinning faceout Epstein’s front door to say goodbye to a departing young brunette.Following the release of that video, Buckingham Palace once again found itselfhaving to issue another statement to “clarify the facts”—this time personallysigned by Prince Andrew himself.It read:At no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness orsuspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest andconviction. I have said previously that it was a mistake and an error to see himafter his release in 2010 and I can only reiterate my regret that I was mistakento think what I thought I knew of him was evidently not the real person, givenwhat we now know. I have tremendous sympathy for all those affected by hisactions and behaviour. This is a difficult time for everyone involved and I amat a loss to be able to understand or explain Mr. Epstein’s lifestyle. I deplorethe exploitation of any human being and would not condone, participate in, orencourage any such behaviour.For Epstein, it was becoming clear that his time rubbing shoulders withlawmakers and royals was over. Luckily, there was an entirely new class ofmovers and shakers for him to exploit: brilliant scientists and tech gurus whowere building the future—and could make his wildest dreams of ultimate powercome true.Epstein had already shown an interest in cultivating such circles.In 2006, he hosted a conference at the Ritz-Carlton on St. Thomas, whichattracted the likes of Stephen Hawking. During one night of the conference,guests were shuttled over to Little St. James for a barbecue and submarine tour.According to reports, the sub was custom-fitted for Hawking’s wheelchair. Aphoto of the event shows him being personally attended to by a young blonde withher hair in a ponytail.Unlike politicians, however, scientists seemed more willing to overlook hisstatus as a heinous sex offender. Yet again, Ghislaine would pave the way.In 2009, Epstein was still in prison when he began planning his grand return tothe establishment. Ghislaine’s sister, Isabel, was in a relationship withleading visual theorist Al Seckel, and he worked with Epstein to plan atriumphant 2010 scientific conference on St. Thomas and Little St. James.Just three months after Epstein’s prison release, Seckel granted him a long,discursive interview that was published on the front page of Epstein’s new—andbizarre—science blog, JeffreyEpsteinScience.org[http://JeffreyEpsteinScience.org].On the blog, Epstein clearly defined his new, post-prison identity, carefullyleaving out the bad bits.Jeffrey E. Epstein serves as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of theFinancial Trust Company. Mr. Epstein started his career at Bear Stearns with aneducational background in physics. He has been a Trustee of the Institute OfInternational Education Inc. since October 2001.He serves as a Director of Financial Trust Company. Previously, Mr. Epstein wasa Member of the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations aswell as the New York Academy of Science. He is also a former RockefellerUniversity Board Member. Currently, Mr. Epstein is actively involved in theSanta Fe Institute, the Theoretical Biology Initiative at the Institute forAdvanced Study, the Quantum Gravity Program at the University of Pennsylvania,and also sits on the Mind, Brain & Behavior Advisory Committee at Harvard.Jeffrey Epstein’s philanthropic affiliations include The COUQ Foundation. He isa member of the Edge Group, an internationally respected group of thinkers andachievers.Of course, he forgot to mention the one qualification that would define hislife: he was a registered sex offender.Refreshed and reinvigorated, Epstein entered his new milieu with a splash.On November 6, 2010, Epstein and Seckel announced the “Mindshift” conference,which would be hosted and funded by Epstein, on St. Thomas and Little St. James.They boasted of a star-studded guest list of science icons: Nobel Prize–winningphysicist Murray Gell-Mann, bestselling author and theoretical physicist LeonardMlodinow, MIT professor and artificial intelligence researcher Gerald JaySussman, neuroscientist Christof Koch, Nobel Laureate Frances Arnold, SiliconValley wunderkind Paul Kirkaas, and more.In the following weeks, Epstein posted interviews with more leading scientistson his new website. Then, in January, the Mindshift conference took place asadvertised. Isabel Maxwell attended as Seckel’s guest, along with the othernotables.Isabel’s friend, Laura Goldman, said, “That was in 2010, after the 2008 charges.They obviously forgave him.”The same month as the conference, Seckel was listed on Epstein’s website amongthe scientists supposedly funded by the pedophile.But then something unexpected happened. In March 2011, Seckel and Isabel Maxwellwere charged with fraud by a mysterious company called Ensign Consulting. Basedin the US Virgin Islands—like so many of Epstein’s businesses—Ensign claimedthat Seckel had advised the company on investments, only to run off with morethan $500,000 for himself.Almost at the same time as the lawsuit became public, Seckel’s interview withEpstein was removed from his science website. By the end of the month, theentire website was gone. Days after that, Seckel was in a terrifying car wreckthat totaled his Lexus.Suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, Seckel issued a signed “declaration” in May2011 clarifying his relationship with Epstein.I have no personal knowledge of Epstein’s private life. Mr. Epstein has notdiscussed his private life with me and our discussions have been strictlylimited to intellectual or philanthropic subjects. . . .I have never met nor had any discussions with any woman or girl who was underthe age of 18 (or previously underaged) who I know to have had intimate ornon-intimate contact with Mr. Epstein. . . .I understand that there has been a subpoena issued to depose me based on alleged‘credible’ information that I have been in the presence of Mr. Epstein and womenor girls under the age of 18. I have not. Nor have I witnessed any sexualbehavior or even innuendo by Mr. Epstein. . . .I further understand that I have been identified as having been in Mr. Epstein’spresence at the same time as famous or “high-profile” people were present. Otherthan those in the scientific community, I am unaware of any persons in ourmutual presence who could be described this way.”Was there truly an ongoing investigation into Epstein at that time? None everbecame public.More importantly, just who was Al Seckel protecting with that decree? Himself?The answer is not immediately clear.What is certain, however, is that from there, Seckel’s life took a dramatic turnfor the worse. Hounded by the Ensign lawsuit, he and Isabel—now his wife—filedfor bankruptcy and fled to France. More messy lawsuits and humiliation followed.Then in spring 2015, Seckel went hiking in France and vanished.A massive search ensued, with participants even including those who had attendedhis conference with Epstein. By June 2015, Seckel’s rental car was found at theside of a cliff. About a month later, his body reportedly was found at thebottom of that same cliff. The cause of death was unclear. Some reports claimedthat like Robert Maxwell, who fell from his yacht and drowned, Seckel’sunfortunate end had been precipitated by a “heart attack.”A few weeks later, Tablet magazine published an explosive article—written whenhe was alive—that claimed Seckel had cultivated information-­gatheringrelationships with powerful people in the worlds of science, politics, media,and more. What’s more, the article claimed that Seckel had been actively tryingto sell the correspondence and personal files of his father-in-law, RobertMaxwell, a businessman and Mossad spy, in the weeks before his death. Did hetake them from Epstein and Ghislaine? In 2004, this team found, Epstein washolding such documents at his Palm Beach home, years before meeting Seckel.In any case, he’d be found dead before he found a buyer.image [../Images/star.jpg]Despite the tech luminaries who visited Little St. James, it was never reallythe hub of Epstein’s scientific pursuits. Instead, Epstein cultivated scientificconnections at his 10,000-acre Zorro Ranch, outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico.In 2010, Epstein donated $25,000 to the nearby Santa Fe Institute, devoted to“the big questions” about science. Already, he was insinuating his way into hisnew crowd. Over the years, he would donate a quarter of a million dollars to thefacility, claiming on his website that he was “actively involved” in theInstitute, presumably by way of his donations. The Institute would later insistthey had no idea about his background.In some sense, though, Epstein made Zorro Ranch an institute of his own.“Our important people were mostly scientists,” Deidre Stratton, the woman taskedwith recruiting young massage therapists for Epstein in New Mexico, toldEpstein: Dead Men Tell No Tales. “Jeffrey helped back their research.”Stratton continued:He would often have . . . you know, like the guy that won the Nobel Prize fordiscovering the quark in quantum physics.A guy that won the Nobel Prize for a DNA discovery, people that help to foundMicrosoft. Those were the kind of people that were there.Scientific and brilliant. They would have very erudite conversations over meals.You would pick up a word here and there. Obviously, you couldn’t really hear thewhole thing.They would invite them to lunch and Ghislaine would have this tablet and shewould write down the facts that they would tell them. At one point she told me,“Well, you get the information from an expert and then you get rid of them.”Like Epstein’s other properties, Zorro Ranch was both over the top anddisturbing in the details.Ean Royal lived with his ranch-hand father on the property in the years afterEpstein’s Florida prison stint.“It was super lavish,” Royal said.He continued:There was an observatory room that had a telescope. Loads of books. Like alittle study, it had a balcony and you could look out through this telescope andkind of look wherever because you had an open sight. This was on the secondfloor.There was this huge parlor room. Almost looked like something you’d find inSherlock Holmes. You’d walk in there. There was this really nice brown desk onone side. You got couches in the middle, and then you got loads of bookseverywhere. Of course books were all over. It’s totally like a Gatsby thing. Allfor show. It really looked like there could’ve been a secret room. Like if Ipulled one of the books, the shelf would move over or something.It was mind-blowing. Like, he had a freaking stuffed sheep in the elevator. Iwould get into the elevator, and you’d be just standing next to this stuffedanimal. Like taxidermy. A straight taxidermy animal. Not like a fake. Just inthe elevator. Just chilling.Beautiful furniture. And it just didn’t make sense. Because it’s like, “Man, youhave all of this stuff, and no one even uses it. This house is empty 80 percentof the time, and we just come in to maintenance it. We just check it out.” I hadthat conversation with my dad a lot. I was like, “Why is this here if he doesn’teven use it?’ You have all this vacation ranch and land, and you don’t even useit? That’s insane.”Even stranger is the fact that hat to this day, the FBI has not raided theproperty; at least, according to public reports and local witnesses.“It’s very weird to me that they haven’t, because there’s a vacation ranch outin the middle of freaking nowhere. Like literally nowhere. Like on acres ofranch,” Royal said.“Acres of land. Why wouldn’t they check it?”He added:Especially when they have the multimillion-dollar mansion, and then basically atiny little town at the base of the ranch with all of these different housingsfor people to live in, and then housings for vehicles, and then all of theanimals there. The front of it is a vacation ranch.But, why would it just be a vacation ranch? When I was younger, I was alwayskind of curious. It was like, “So he’s spending all of this money just to run avacation ranch that he doesn’t even come to?” I’m like, “He has all of theseanimals, and all of these people that just maintain the ranch.” And it seemslike the whole point of it was to just bring people there for some reason,whatever it may be, to be entertained.Because if he had guests over, like I said, the guests would have entertainment.They would go shooting, they would go horseback riding. But as far as anythingoutside of that, they couldn’t have just been going to do that. You know what Imean?They wouldn’t just go to the ranch to shoot some guns and ride horses.Especially if they’re important people. I’m sure what would happen is Epsteinwas buttering them up, and giving them this as a gift, and then trying to getsomething out of them or from them, or whatever it may be. Basically, butteringthem up before he pitches whatever ideas, or thoughts he might have to do withwhatever, which is why governors would end up being there. Politician would endup being there.According to Stratton, the ranch did feature unique entertainment for itsguests.“I’ll tell you one thing that happened, like every time practically,” Strattonsaid.“They had a goat that looked like Merlin, long horns, long hair. It wasobviously a male goat, if you know anything about goats.“Anyway, so they had this little game where they would have the girls or a girl,whomever, they were entertaining down to the stables and the stable lady namedShanna, she would already be sitting on a stool milking the goat. It was staged.“She he had this little jar with a little milk in it. So then the next thingthey would say is, ‘Would you like to try to milk the goat?’ So of course, thegirl sat on the stool and Shanna would reach her hands under there to his like‘udder,’ which was actually his sexual organs and tried to milk him.“Well, nothing would happen. Then suddenly they’d go, ‘Oh, it’s a male goat!’“That poor goat. I started feeling badly for the goat.”image [../Images/star.jpg]Epstein’s employees were required to keep quiet about what they saw and heard onthe ranch.Nancy Sowle, owner of the local general store, told us that the air of secrecysurrounding the ranch was unmistakable—and oppressive.“Everything was so secretive up there,” Sowle said. “The employees had to signthat they would never disclose any information. It was just all very secretive,and as you found out, you can’t get past the gate and what have you. It bothersme that there are people like that, obviously, but I guess based on everythingelse that we’ve heard about Epstein and all of these other locations, it’supsetting. But it’s not surprising, also, that it occurred out here.“I don’t know,” Sowle continued. “I think maybe people move out here becausethey think that we’re so far away from the media and other things, so maybethat’s why he decided to build up here.”Ean Royal remembered: “My dad was super secretive about it, of course, becausehe was told that was his job. It’s like, ‘Don’t say anything. Don’t say hisname.’ All of this stuff.“I would ask my dad and he was like, ‘I can’t tell you. I can’t tell you hisname.’ Then I think at one point he could tell me his first name. So, I learnedJeffrey is Jeffrey.“I didn’t have any personal connection with Jeffrey, but from what I understand,and how secretive everything was, like if there was a man that had nothing tohide, why was he hiding everything? You know what I mean? I would definitely saythat he’s a monster. He was hiding stuff. He was doing a lot of stuff with a lotof important people. But if he’s talking to politicians and people who are inpower and actually interacting with them and bringing them to his ranch, he’sgot an evil M.O. [modus operandi].”Epstein’s ultimate goal was—if not evil—certainly unusual. In the early 2000s,he made it clear to several close friends that he had embraced transhumanism,the belief that science and technology would eventually allow humans to evolvebeyond the confines of the body.Indeed, as he said before prison, “Your body can be contained. But not yourmind.”In pursuing that goal, he hoped to use Zorro Ranch as his testing ground.We have independently corroborated through sources that Epstein planned todeep-freeze his body—specifically his head and penis—so that he could be thawedin the future, supposedly when science had advanced enough for reanimation.Another aspect of his master plan allegedly included impregnating dozens ofwomen to strengthen the Earth’s gene pool—with his own genes. Scientist JaronLanier, who once overheard Epstein prattle on at a dinner party, said Epsteinhad “based his idea for a baby ranch on accounts of the Repository for GerminalChoice, which was to be stocked with the sperm of Nobel laureates.” (Originallynamed the Hermann J. Muller Repository for Germinal Choice, the Repository was asperm bank that operated in Escondido, Calif., from 1980 to 1999. The Repositorywas commonly believed to have accepted only donations from recipients of theNobel Prize, although it did accept donations from non-Nobelists, also.)Of course, Epstein’s big idea was nothing new. The Nazis had called it eugenics.To Epstein’s former attorney Alan Dershowitz, such talk was commonplace withEpstein, if seriously disturbing. “At one point, at a meeting, he talked aboutsomething that sounded too eugenics for most of us,” Dershowitz told ourreporter.“There was a lot of [talk] about how eugenics had been misused in the 1930s, andnone of us wanted to have anything to do with anything that sounded eugenic.”According to Dershowitz, “Mostly he was interested in evolutionary biology thatdidn’t relate to human beings, related to what Darwin had done and others haddone. That’s why he was particularly interested in Stephen Jay Gould.” (Goulddied in 2002, long before Epstein’s crimes became public.)“But he never ever discussed with anybody I know, any of those weird ideas.”Had he, Dershowitz claimed: “He would have been laughed out of Harvard.”Perhaps that is why he kept such discussions to carefully selected companions athis New Mexico enclave. To Epstein, acceptance by academics—and by Harvard, mostof all—was paramount.Epstein’s former friend Jesse Kornbluth explained the obsession: “I went toHarvard, and Harvard was extremely meaningful for Jeffrey.“If you look at pictures of him in later life, he’s wearing a Harvardsweatshirt, he’s giving money to Harvard. He owns an office in Harvard Square,and is palling around with Harvard scientists. Harvard was the kind ofvalidation he sought, and it was validation which I had already acquired.”As with most things he wanted, Epstein tried first to buy his way into Harvard.University President Lawrence S. Bacow sent an email to students and alumnialmost exactly one month after Epstein’s death that laid bare the extent of hiscontributions:Our review to date indicates that between 1998 and 2007, Epstein made a numberof gifts to support various faculty and institutional research activities acrossthe University. The largest of these was a $6.5 million gift in 2003 to supportthe Program for Evolutionary Dynamics.The University received other gifts, which totaled approximately $2.4 million,based on current information. Each of these gifts from Epstein and hisaffiliated foundations to Harvard University predates his guilty plea in June2008. To date, we have uncovered no gifts received from Epstein or hisfoundation following his guilty plea.Moreover, we specifically rejected a gift from Epstein following his convictionin 2008. We have also recently learned that Stephen Kosslyn, a former facultymember and a beneficiary of Epstein’s philanthropy, designated Epstein as aVisiting Fellow in the Department of Psychology in 2005. We are seeking to learnmore about the nature of that appointment from Dr. Kosslyn, who no longer worksat the University.Epstein’s cash bought him respect on campus. In June 2003, a writer for TheCrimson penned a fawning article about Epstein’s contributions. (Oddly, it wouldbe that freshman author’s last contribution to the paper.)Noting that Epstein “donated $30 million this year to Harvard for the foundingof a mathematical biology and evolutionary dynamics program,” the articleboasted of his “bevy of eminent friends that includes princes, presidents andNobel Prize winners.” One such colleague was then-President of Harvard, Lawrence“Larry” Summers: “The two serve together on the Trilateral Commission and theCouncil on Foreign Relations, two elite international relations organizations,”the article explained.Separately, Epstein also was a top donor for Harvard’s Hasty Pudding theatertroupe as late as 2018. (The group announced in October 2019 that they would bedonating to an anti-sex-trafficking nonprofit following the revelation.)The nature of Epstein’s role as Visiting Fellow remains murky. He did, however,use his time and vaunted placement at Harvard to cultivate even more importantfriendships.One of the leaders of the psychology department in the time that Epstein wasthere was Stephen Pinker. Popular among students, Pinker was known for his cloudof curly white hair and bestselling books, such as The Language Instinct and Howthe Mind Works.In 2007, when Epstein was facing monstrous allegations in Florida, Pinkercontributed his professional opinion to a disturbing legal document in the case,one that argued Epstein was not guilty of using the Internet to lure teenvictims. Actually, the document implied, any luring had been done in person.Pinker has said that being categorized as a friend or even coconspirator ofEpstein is seriously misguided. In a statement, he called it an “annoying irony”that his association with Epstein would be a black mark on his record, since “Icould never stand the guy, never took research funding from him and always triedto keep my distance.”As with most statements of denial regarding Epstein, that last sentence raisesan eyebrow. Pinker appears in the flight logs for the “Lolita Express” in 2002,long before Epstein got his official position at Harvard. Even moredisturbingly, he was photographed lunching and chatting with Epstein at a 2014lunch—more than five years after he became a convicted sex felon.Pinker explained away the chilling photo on the social media site Twitter: “Ihave no relationship with Epstein & have taken no funding from him. Our circleshave occasionally overlapped: In 02, my lit agent invited me to join a group ofeast-coast TED speakers Epstein flew to CA. In 14, Krauss seated me next to himat a lunch, & someone snapped a photo.”But the very next year, Pinker tweeted a link to a legal argument from thedefense in Virginia Roberts Giuffre’s civil lawsuit—a document that refuted herclaims.So far, the scandal has only managed to subject Pinker to hundreds of angrytweets and dozens of probing blog posts.As for Pinker and Epstein’s pal Lawrence Krauss, who also appeared in the 2014lunch photo, he has not emerged unscathed.There is more of a paper trail connecting Krauss to Epstein than the one thatsmeared Pinker’s reputation. Voice messages to Epstein from Krauss obtained bythis team show several calls from the scientist to Epstein’s Palm Beach home.One, sent on January 7, 2004, read, “Thank you for the evening last night inNYC.” Epstein’s secretary wrote, “You can call him about time and money.”Just over a year later, on February 28, 2005: “He has sent you some faxes thathe would like to follow up.”Later than that message, but undated: “He had meeting with filmmaker and hesympathize [sic] with project.”In 2018, Krauss left his post at Arizona State University amid a cloud ofscandal—actually, one that had very little to do with Epstein.The theoretical physicist and astrophysicist faced an onslaught of sexualmisconduct claims at the height of the #MeToo movement. In just one disturbingexample of the allegations, a woman claimed he had grabbed her breasts at aritzy conference gala. Dr. Krauss denied the claims: “To be clear, I have neverharassed or assaulted anyone and have most certainly not exhibited genderdiscrimination in my professional dealings at the university or elsewhere.”Down the road from Harvard, at MIT, Epstein’s contributions were even cloudier.In September 2019, Joichi Ito stepped down from MIT’s Media Lab after the NewYorker reported he had tried to cover up donations from Epstein.A convicted child molester, Epstein was actually on MIT’s list of “disqualified”donors following his prison stint. Ito took his money anyways, the New Yorkerreported, camouflaging nearly $2 million in donations.Ito was shameless in his greed. In one email, he wrote of an Epstein donation:“Make sure this gets reported as anonymous.”Epstein also channeled funds from his famous friends like Bill Gates to the lab.In another email, the lab’s then–director of development and strategy, PeterCohen, wrote, “This is a $2M gift from Bill Gates directed by Jeffrey Epstein.For gift recording purposes, we will not be mentioning Jeffrey’s name as theimpetus for this gift.” (Gates’s rep denied Epstein had anything to do with thedonation.)What did these men get from their associations with Epstein? Beyond the thrillof flying high on private jet flights and secluded Caribbean islands, the appealwas obvious: Epstein donated millions in grants and gifts through his many“foundations” each year, and advertised that fact on the front page ofJeffreyEpsteinScience.com [http://JeffreyEpsteinScience.com].The company of beautiful young women, of course, would have been an added bonus.For Epstein, the value of these men was not just in the way it made him—acollege dropout—seem like a legitimate intellectual leader by association. Thediscoveries and research of these men could have had serious applications in theworlds of armament, technology, and surveillance.In short, their lunchtime chitchat became Epstein’s offerings to theinternational intelligence community."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13CAUGHTBy early 2019, it seemed that the world had forgotten about Jeffrey Epstein andhis crimes. To him, it may have seemed—at last—that he’d gotten away with itall.The civil cases in Florida were moving slowly through the justice system. InDecember 2018, he paid to settle a lawsuit with victim attorney Bradley Edwards,preventing any trial and silencing his victims yet again. Several women had beenready to take the stand, but they were pushed yet again into the shadows ofsilence.More than ten years after Jane Does #1 and 2 had filed their lawsuit against theUS government regarding Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement, that too had yet tobear legal any fruit. But by February 2019, that all changed.On February 7, 2019, the Department of Justice confirmed that they had begun aninvestigation into whether there had been “professional misconduct” in theunusual handling of Epstein’s secret plea deal.Two weeks later, US District Judge Kenneth A. Marra ruled in favor of Jane Does#1 and 2 in Florida, agreeing that the United States government had indeedbroken the law during their handling of the nonprosecution agreement.“Particularly problematic was the government’s decision to conceal the existenceof the [nonprosecution agreement] and mislead the victims to believe thatfederal prosecution was still a possibility,” Marra wrote, referring to onecommunication that told the plaintiffs to remain “patient.”“When the government gives information to victims, it cannot be misleading.”He continued:Epstein and his co-conspirators knowingly traveled in interstate andinternational commerce to sexually abuse Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2 and others, theycommitted violations of not only Florida law, but also federal law.In addition to his own sexual abuse of the victims, Epstein directed otherpersons to abuse the girls sexually. . . . Epstein worked in concert with othersto obtain minors not only for his own sexual gratification, but also for thesexual gratification of others.The net was closing in.image [../Images/star.jpg]Flying on a private jet from Paris, landing at a private airport, skipping thebaggage claim to head straight to the luxury ride awaiting—it was the only wayto travel for someone of Jeffrey Epstein’s milieu. For Jeffrey Epstein, July 6,2019, had promised to be yet another serene and sumptuous evening in the life ofa billionaire.As the plane taxied down the tarmac, however, the sun setting on the horizon, helikely realized that there was going to be a change of plans. Epstein’s bubbleof wealth and privilege was popped, perhaps once and for all. Federal agentsstood ready on the tarmac, swooping in to handcuff and arrest him as soon as hewalked off the infamous “Lolita Express” for the very last time.At the same time, federal agents swarmed his Manhattan palace, ready to openevery drawer and search the rooms where visitors had never set foot. A crowbargot them through his massive solid oak front doors, as onlookers watched,shocked.To no one’s surprise, authorities found ample evidence to confirm that Epsteinwas trafficking girls for sex. In his safe, they discovered hundreds ofsickening nude pictures of young victims, and the graphic photographs matchedthe most disturbing details that Epstein’s victims had provided.He also had curated an organized library of digital videos that identified thenames of his “friends” and the young girls they had violated. Federal agentsseized all of it. They also recovered heaps of cash and diamonds, and a fakeexpired passport with Epstein’s picture plastered inside. It listed hisresidence as Saudi Arabia. (In court, Epstein’s lawyers argued that he’d neverused the phony passport, but the document itself indicated that it’d been usedto get into the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Saudi Arabia. Epstein’sattorneys said in a filing submitted to court that he obtained the passportbecause he felt it could give him some protection if he fell victim to anairline hijacking or a terrorist incident, and that it’d been expired for morethan three decades.)Importantly, the trove of evidence was not just proof of Epstein’s sex crimes;the materials also corroborated the victims’ claims that Epstein secretlyrecorded them in the act. Epstein and his coconspirators seemed poised forcertain doom, as a copy of the voluminous evidence list was turned over to USDistrict Judge Richard Berman.Two days later, the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New Yorkhosted a joint press conference with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Entering the room, reporters were greeted with a massive blown-up photo ofEpstein, and a phone number imploring potential victims to call the authorities.Manhattan US Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman—an appointee of President Donald J.Trump—approached the podium to deliver the jaw-dropping news: Jeffrey Epsteinhad been indicted for sex trafficking. It was a day that had seemed like itwould never come. For those of us who’d covered the case for years, andcertainly for the victims, it had a surreal quality. Did we dare hope forjustice this time around?Berman began to speak:Today, we announce the unsealing of sex trafficking charges against JeffreyEpstein. The charges allege that Epstein sexually abused young girls by enticingthem to engage in sex acts for money.Epstein was arrested this past Saturday evening at Teterboro Airport aboard hisprivate jet that had just landed from Paris, France. Epstein was taken to theMetropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan.And later today he will be presented before a Magistrate Judge Pitman and latera conference before District Court Judge Berman.The United States attorney’s office will take the position at that presentmentand that conference that Epstein should be detained pending trial. Epstein ischarged in a two-count indictment. First conspiracy to commit sex traffickingand second the substantive crime of sex trafficking of underage girls.Beginning in at least 2002 and continuing until 2005, Epstein is alleged to haveabused dozens of victims by causing them to engage in sex acts with him at hismansion in New York and at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida.The victims, all underage girls at the time of the alleged conduct, were givenhundreds of dollars in cash after each encounter either by Epstein or by one ofEpstein’s employees. The underage girls were initially recruited to provideEpstein with massages and often did so nude or partially nude.These massages became increasingly sexual in nature and would typically includeone or more sex acts as specified in the indictment. As alleged, Epstein alsopaid certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly abused. Thisallowed Epstein to create an ever-expanding web of new victims.This conduct, as alleged, went on for years and it involved dozens of younggirls, some as young as 14 years old at the time that they were allegedlyabused. As alleged, Epstein was well aware that many of his victims were minors.And not surprisingly, many of the underage girls that Epstein allegedlyvictimized were particularly vulnerable to exploitation.The alleged behavior shocks the conscience. And while the charged conduct isfrom a number of years ago, it is still profoundly important to the many allegedvictims now young women. They deserve their day in court and we are proud to bestanding up for them by bringing this indictment.Combating sex trafficking and exploitation of children is a priority for thisoffice and for the Department of Justice as the sexual abuse of a minor can havedevastating effects on victims often lasting for years. That is why my officewill not rest until the perpetrators of these types of crimes are brought tojustice.Victims’ voices, including the many voices of Epstein’s alleged victims must beheard. To that end I want to say to anyone who was watching this or hearingabout our prosecution, if you believe you are a victim of this man JeffreyEpstein. Or you have evidence or information leading to the conduct alleged inthe indictment unsealed today, we want to hear from you. Please call. 1-800-CALLFBI, that’s 1-800-CALL FBI.The charges unsealed today reflect the hard work not only of this office, but byour law enforcement partners at the Federal Bureau of Investigation.The FBI had failed to bring Epstein to justice back in Florida. Why should hisvictims believe that it would play out differently this time around, in anotherjurisdiction? William Sweeney, Assistant-Director-in-Charge of the New Yorkoffice of the FBI, stepped forward with a message. He began:Preserving the innocence in children is one of the most importantresponsibilities we carry as adults. Purposely failing children in any way isnot an option.And yet there are some in society who have chosen to blatantly disregard thisresponsibility, using whatever means they have at their disposal to lurechildren into a life which they should never have been exposed. As we allegetoday, Jeffrey Epstein is one of those people.At approximately 5:30 p.m. on Saturday evening we arrested him at TeterboroAirport without incident. Epstein has been charged with one count each of sextrafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy.For at least a four-year period, covering the entirety of 2002 through 2005, heis alleged to have sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls at hishomes in New York City and in Palm Beach, Florida.The girls were recruited in a variety of ways, usually by employees of Epsteinand sometimes by fellow victims. The victims typically received hundreds ofdollars in cash. The estimated dozens of victims were as young as fourteen yearsold at the time of recruitment.Children who provided up steam massages while they were nude or partially nude.Children who were asked to engage in direct and indirect sex acts for money.Children who were enticed to do all these things at the hands of a man more thanor nearly three times their age. Those who had been victimized by child sexualpredators are frequently haunted by memories of these crimes well into theiradulthood, often for the rest of their lives. They bear the burden of someoneelse’s criminal behavior.Too often, adults in our society have turned a blind eye to this type ofcriminal behavior alleged here. We have seen the excuses. The ignorance of manywho didn’t even bother to understand that this behavior is this persistentscourge against our society’s vulnerable youth. And the willful blindness as towho the real villains are in this type of outrageous crime.The villains are the adult perpetrators, not the children. Victims of child sextrafficking come from all walks of life. They are our neighbors, our students,young adults looking for help, vulnerable foster children, the list goes on andon and on.To the victims who may be listening or get word of today’s charges, the teamstanding here before you represents FBI Special Agents, NYPD detectives,analyst, victim specialist, prosecutors who make it their mission to listen toevery individual who’s been exploited and to advocate for the most vulnerableamong us.We are parents, we are community members, we are human beings. But as an FBISpecial Agent and the head of this office, I have the privilege to represent andstand among many who make it our mission to put predators behind bars where theybelong, regardless of the predator’s power wealth or perceived connections.Today, I’m asking everyone to take a good look at this man. If you have beenvictimized in any way or if you are somebody who has any additional informationabout his alleged illegal behavior, we want to hear from you. Whatever age youare now, whatever age you were then, no matter where or when the incident orincidents took place. . . .Your bravery might just empower others to speak out about crimes committedagainst them. It’s important to remember there never was nor will there be anexcuse for this kind of behavior. We know that reliving these events can bebrutal. We are here to work side by side with you as you go through thisprocess. You should know that in the eyes of the FBI you come first.Then, Berman jumped in again: “We’re going to take some questions. But first letme preface it by saying that there’s been a lot of speculation in the mediaabout individuals affiliated or associated with defending Jeffrey Epstein.”“As you know, Justice Department guidelines prohibit us from talking about suchindividuals, and so I just want to let you know that if that question comes upabout any individual, my answer will be, no comment. And that will be across theboard no comment.” That part of the investigation, regarding the coconspirators,was clearly ongoing.The first question raised by reporters was: If Epstein was bound by thenotorious Florida nonprosecution agreement, how had prosecutors been able tobring new charges?Berman explained, “Jeffrey Epstein entered into a non-prosecution agreement withthe Southern District of Florida. That agreement only binds—by its terms onlybinds to Southern District of Florida. The Southern District of New York is notbound by that agreement and is not a signatory to that agreement.”The same would be true for his coconspirators.image [../Images/star.jpg]Meanwhile, Epstein had a lot of time to consider his next move as he sat lockedup in a eight-by-eight jail cell. Immediately after his arrest, Epstein had beentaken directly to the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a rust-colored federaldetention facility in the heart of Lower Manhattan.The “MCC” is where New York’s most cold-blooded criminals are incarcerated whileawaiting trial or bail. At the time, the MCC was the temporary home of Mexicankingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán and Trump’s presidential campaign chairmanPaul Manafort. Previous inmates included mob boss John Gotti, financialfraudster Bernie Madoff, and the 1993 World Trade Center bomber Ramzi Yousef.In other words, it was secure. Or so people thought.Located a few blocks from the Brooklyn Bridge and bustling Chinatown, MCC is oneof several federal buildings in the immediate area. The US Attorney’s office,NYPD headquarters, and City Hall are directly nearby. It is, in essence, meantto be the most secure area of the Big Apple.Like each of the other eight hundred felons at MCC, Epstein was booked, strippedof his identity, and given his inmate number: 76318–054. He was taken to theninth floor (also known as 9-South), which is a special housing unit for violentinmates and new arrivals who require protective custody. Epstein had to be keptout of the general population, it was thought, because every felon would hit himup—or rough him up—for money.But segregation came at a price.In 9-South, all 120 inmates are divided into sixty two-man cells. Epstein waslocked up in cell number 123 with fifty-two-year-old Nicholas Tartaglione, abrawny retired policeman charged with executing four men in upstate New York.The cells in 9-South don’t have bars. Each eight-by-eight-foot unit iscompletely sealed off by a solid door, which has a narrow rectangular window anda “trap” where food trays are placed. The slot is also used to cuff inmatesbehind their back before the cell door is opened. Besides a bunk bed and aprominent toilet, each cell has a sink, a small shower in the corner, and afixed desk and stool. A single frosted-glass window gave Epstein a few inches ofdaylight from the outside world.Inmates are locked up for twenty-three-and-a-half hours a day. For the remainingthirty minutes, they are permitted to walk around a small portion of the tier:In Epstein’s case, it was the “M-Tier.” But according to an inmate who was in9-South with Epstein, the 9-South guards “never let you out of the cell.”“It’s a nightmare,” the inmate told our investigator. “It’s a hellhole for allof us. There are roaches and rats and it’s never cleaned. The cell is rancid andthey wouldn’t give Epstein anything to clean it. . . . That place is out ofcontrol.”Two days after his arrest, on July 8, Epstein was let out of his cell to attendhis first court hearing, where he was officially charged with sex traffickingand conspiracy to traffic minors for sex.Not surprisingly, an arrogant Epstein pleaded not guilty. The judge scheduledhis bail hearing for July 12.Until then, Epstein and his attorneys planned to use every waking moment to plottheir strategy.“Epstein was taking over one of the only two rooms to meet lawyers in,” hisjailmate recalled. “He always tied up the lawyer’s meeting room because he neverwanted to be in that cell. That pissed off the inmates and the guards because itseemed like special treatment.”Worse, other witnesses claimed that Epstein and his lawyers routinely sat therein silence. His legal team, it seemed, was only there so he could stretch hislegs outside the confines of his cell.To further insulate himself from the harsh realities of prison, Epstein had hislawyers transfer money to the commissary accounts of several other inmates, onejail insider told these authors. The recipients could then use the “storecredit” to purchase perks like toiletries, snacks, and stationery.Social chameleon Epstein was at it again in an entirely new crowd, using hismoney to get people in his pocket.But prison was not like his private island. When Epstein started throwing moneyaround, it had an unintended consequence—one that may have proved deadly.“The guards hated that Epstein got special treatment because of his money,” hisformer jailmate told us exclusively. “The guards treated Epstein worse than anyother inmate.”Inmates had to call the guards if they needed more toilet paper or cleaningsupplies, for example, but the guards specifically ignored Epstein and made him“wait for everything,” the jailhouse source claimed.“They would never bring it when Epstein asked,” his jailmate claimed. “Theywould always come if Epstein’s bunkie (bunkmate) asked for anything, but neverif he did. They would always say the guard on the next shift would take care ofit, then that guard would say he knew nothing about it.”In his hasty attempt to win over his new peers, far from the glitz, glamor—andfreedom—of life past, Epstein had irreversibly alienated the true prison powerplayers.The day after his first court hearing, Epstein and his victims got an unexpectedsurprise. Facing heavy criticism for his handling of Epstein’s 2008 case, formerMiami prosecutor Alexander Acosta resigned from Trump’s cabinet under enormouspressure. Pressure, perhaps, for a public whipping boy to take the fall.“I thought the right thing was to step aside,” Acosta said, claiming that hiscontinued presence as head of the United States Department of Labor wouldjeopardize President Trump’s goal of “putting the American people first.”“This was him, not me,” Trump declared. “I said, ‘You don’t have to do this.’”Still, one might wonder if Trump was relieved to dissolve one of the conspicuouslinks between him and America’s most famous pedophile, dating backdecades—decades the public did not know about until this book.Acosta stepped down and announced that he would devote his time to helpingEpstein’s rapidly expanding list of victims. At the time of this writing, it’sunclear what form that mission will take, if any.Back at MCC, however, Epstein and his legal team plotted their next move.Shockingly, it seemed they truly believed he was going to make bail. Epsteincould have begun to daydream about a return to his mansion, with around theclock chaperones in tow, and an ankle bracelet to keep track of his every move.At the bail hearing on July 12, the shape of their argument emerged.Epstein’s attorney focused on the fact that all of the New York accusationsagainst him were alleged to have taken place before 2005. The next fourteenyears, free of any public claims, supposedly proved Epstein’s first jail termhad “worked.”“He wasn’t a predator that couldn’t control his conduct,” Martin Weinberg toldthe judge. “He disciplined himself.”The attorney argued that Epstein was not a “future danger” to girls and could betrusted in the real world.“It’s not like he’s an out-of-control rapist,” counsel insisted.But Judge Berman was not convinced.“How do you know that?” the Judge pressed, clearly skeptical that the “passageof time” was the proper way to measure the danger of having Epstein on theloose.Assistant US Attorney Alex Rossmiller seized on that line of thinking.“They concede that he has to discipline himself,” the attorney answered. “Thisidea that he has ‘disciplined himself’ is a concession that he has an appetitefor children.”In a Hail Mary play, Weinberg suggested setting Epstein’s bail at $100million—or more. But Rossmiller’s determination to keep Epstein captive wasunshakable.“What the defendant is asking for here is special treatment, to build his ownjail, to be limited in his own gilded cage,” the defense attorney continued. “Aperson who needs these conditions should be detained. . . . He has everyincentive to flee if he is released.”Judge Berman already knew all about the talented Mr. Epstein. He had beenbriefed on the pictures, the videos, the money, and the fake passport inEpstein’s safe. He was aware of Epstein’s habit of “generosity” to those whocould help him get his way.Judge Berman had been appointed to his seat on the District Court for theSouthern District of New York by Epstein’s former pal, President Bill Clinton.As a steward of the law, Berman wanted to see all of the evidence. He alsowanted to hear from Epstein’s victims.But first, and most of all, was the pending question of whether to keep Epsteinbehind bars.Court adjourned until his decision could be rendered.While Judge Berman was considering the evidence, however, a new chapter to thestory began. On July 17, an eighteen-year-old woman—identified in her claim asKaitlyn Doe—filed a lawsuit claiming that Epstein had sexually violated her inOctober 2008, while he was on work release from prison at his West Palm Beach“Florida Science Foundation” office. She claimed that a deputy was standingoutside the door the entire time and did nothing to thwart the attack.According to Doe, the meetings were scheduled to discuss her “necessarysurgeries.” Not only did Epstein force her to perform sex acts, according to thefiling; but also, Doe claimed he demanded that she marry one of his femalerecruiters—a non-US citizen who needed a green card.“Jeffrey Epstein, through his brazen and powerful organization, was quiteliterally able to commit federal sex trafficking offenses at his work releaseoffice, during his jail sentence,” court documents obtained for this book state.The victim’s attorney, Brad Edwards, came forward to claim that Epstein used his“work” during prison to sucker many women into sex.“They believed they were going there for something other than a sexual purpose,”Edwards said. “Not one of the individuals was a prostitute. These were allpeople who at that time wanted something. They came over under false pretensesand he manipulated them.”Upon learning about the claim, Florida Governor Ron Desantis ordered animmediate—if woefully belated—investigation into Epstein’s work-release programand the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s office.The following day, unsurprisingly, Epstein’s request for bail was denied.In his written order, Judge Berman stated:The Government’s evidence against Mr. Epstein appears strong. The evidenceincludes testimony of victims, some of whom were minor girls when they wereallegedly sexually abused by Mr. Epstein; other witnesses, including potentialco-conspirators; physical evidence, including passports reflecting extensiveforeign travel; sexually suggestive photographs of nude underage girls; pleadiscussions; and police reports describing witness tampering and intimidation .. .This newly discovered evidence also suggests that Mr. Epstein poses ongoing andforward-looking danger. . . . Mr. Epstein’s dangerousness is considerable andincludes sex crimes with minor girls and tampering with potential witnesses . ..Mr. Epstein’s alleged excessive attraction to sexual conduct with or in thepresence of minor girls—which is said to include his soliciting and receivingmassages from young girls and young women perhaps as many as four times aday—appears likely to be uncontrollable . . .The Court finds that the Government has shown by a preponderance of the evidencethat Mr. Epstein is a flight risk. . . . The Court is also concerned for newvictims. . . . The Government’s motion for remand (detention) is granted and theDefense motion for pretrial release is denied.Epstein’s legal team immediately protested, filing an appeal. Either missing orwillfully ignoring the enormous scope of the ruling, they focused on Epstein’sfake passport. They claimed it had been used to disguise his Jewish heritage inthe Middle East, where he could have been a desirable target for kidnappers. Formany, that seemed like a stretch.A trial date was set for mid-2020 and Epstein was sent back to his cell. Thejudge ordered that he would stay there up until the trial.Of course, he would not."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14DEAD OR GONENights at the MCC prison were never quite silent. But on July 23, whatever peacethat reigned there was shattered at 1:28 am, when guards heard a cry for helpcoming from within cell #123. They rushed to the cell, peered through the narrowcell door window, and saw inmate 76318–054—Jeffrey Epstein—crumpled in a fetalposition on the concrete floor.His face, feet and hands were light blue. He seemed motionless. He looked dead.Epstein’s cellmate, Nicholas Tartaglione, was still shouting for assistance asthe guards opened the door. They entered the cell and ordered the hulking andagitated Tartaglione to turn around. After securing him, the guards grabbedEpstein’s limp body and lifted it as if they were about to dispose of an oldrug.Our investigation uncovered a fellow inmate who actually witnessed the incidentfrom across the prison hall.“The main guy watching Epstein the night he tried to kill himself had alwaysseemed like he didn’t want anything to do with him,” the cellblock neighbor toldus exclusively.I heard Epstein’s bunkie call for help, and when they opened the door I sawEpstein on the floor.When they carried him out of the cell, they dropped him on the floor face-first.He didn’t make a sound because he was out cold. I heard his head hit the floorwith a thud. I thought he was dead.Then they lifted him up cuffed him and dropped him AGAIN—this time face-first onthe stretcher. They throw him facedown onto it. It looked like there were markson his neck. They must have revived him with CPR.Indeed, the MCC medical staff successfully revived Epstein and kept him in theinfirmary for the rest of the evening. They suspected his injuries were due tofoul play, but Tartaglione firmly denied that conclusion. He pointed out that heactually saved Epstein’s life—a claim our prison witness corroborates.“I don’t think Epstein’s cellmate had anything to do with it,” the jailmateinsisted. “They were good with each other. Epstein’s cellmate seemed to watchout for him. There was no way he attacked him.”That left only two other scenarios: Epstein’s wounds were self-inflicted. Or,someone else had managed to enter and exit the cell.Certainly, Epstein’s transition from the high life to prison life had been therockiest of roads. Had he reached his breaking point in the five days sincebeing denied bail? It seems incredibly unlikely. If shape-shifting Epstein hadone enduring quality, it was a belief that he was above the law.That presented the second possibility. One that was much more nefarious. WhileEpstein tried to silence his victims, was someone else trying to silence him?Certainly, the walls of the MCC would prove no match for a team as sophisticatedas the Kremlin or Mossad. At that time, however, it was a line of investigationthat the Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice—led by William Barr,remember, the son of Epstein’s old Dalton connection—did not seem interested inpursuing.The event had left Epstein startlingly pale and gaunt, but prison officials feltthat the neck abrasions didn’t reflect an earnest suicide attempt. In theiropinion, Epstein had staged the incident to garner sympathy from the court.Indeed, the marks on his neck were not immediately visible when he appeared incourt again just a few days later.“We don’t know at this point whether his injuries are caused by a suicideattempt or an attack by others,” victims’ attorney Gloria Allred said at thetime.“However he sustained his injuries, we want him to be forced to face a jury andrespond to the serious charges that he is facing.”To that end, the MCC’s most notorious new inmate was relocated to the moresecure suicide prevention wing. But for Epstein, it only made life behind barsworse.Epstein’s new home was a solitary confinement unit, where conditions were evenmore dire than in 9-South. The few “luxuries” that he had been allowed therewere revoked while he sat alone in his suicide-risk room.All objects that Epstein could potentially use to inflict bodily harm were notallowed. He had no clothing or bed linens to strangle himself with, only a gownand bedding “blanket” made of paper that prevented him from self-harm. He had nobooks, no mail, and wasn’t provided with anything to pass the time. He had afixed desk and stool, but no reason to use it. He had a shower, but the faucethad an “off” timer to prevent him from drowning himself in a clogged drain. Thiswas by design.For meals, Epstein was given crude, single-ingredient sandwiches. At night, thelights never went out, so the guard stationed outside his cell could observe himat all times.Epstein also wasn’t allowed visitors or phone calls during his observationalperiod. If he wanted to die, he’d have to—literally—bash his own brains out.While on suicide watch, Epstein had daily psychiatric evaluations. However, theywere very brief in length. A single psychologist serviced both the MCC and the1,600-inmate Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, a workload that wasobscene by any standard.After a few days in this veritable torture chamber, the cold reality of hispredicament must have set in.For nearly five decades, Epstein had spoiled himself with an unbroken chain ofinstant gratification. He did what he wanted, when he wanted, and how he wanted.He ate well and considered restaurants filthy. He practiced yoga and showeredseveral times a day. He slept with the A/C at polar temperatures and startedevery day with the same special bran muffin. He had butlers, chauffeurs, andprivate chefs.Life in the suicide ward, for a soulless individual like Epstein, would havebeen intolerable. So, as he had done for years, he decided to use someone elseto better his situation: He blamed his injuries on cellmate Tartaglione.“It’s simply, patently false to say that Epstein did anything other than try tokill himself,” said Tartaglione’s attorney Bruce Barket, who confirmed thatEpstein and Taraglione were “friends” and that MCC “cleared” his client ofwrongdoing.But Epstein’s lawyers convinced prison staff, and he used his silver tongue toconvince his shrink that he had been cured—of his suicidal impulses, at least.“Once an inmate is placed on suicide watch, the watch may only be terminated bya Bureau [of Prisons] psychologist following a face-to-face evaluation of theinmate,” Assistant Attorney General Stephen E. Boyd would later confirm.“Mr. Epstein was later removed from suicide watch after being evaluated by adoctoral-level psychologist who determined that suicide watch was no longerwarranted.”But according to forensic psychiatrist Dr. Ziv Cohen, who has made the rounds atMCC, “Any case where someone had a proven or suspected serious suicide attempt,that would be unusual to within two to three weeks take them off suicide watch.”Such protocol is in place to protect the prison’s residents. But to some,Epstein’s well-being was the last thing on the guards’ minds.“The guards were happy Epstein was trying to kill himself,” his jailmate toldthese authors. “They laughed at him. The guards definitely didn’t like Epstein.I think they took him off suicide watch and put him back on 9-Southintentionally.”In any case, on July 29, Epstein shuffled back to his former digs, where herejoined Tartaglione.Former warden Cameron Lindsay, who was a member of the US Department ofJustice’s Senior Executive Service when he retired from the Federal Bureau ofPrisons, told reporter Doug Montero that Epstein’s speedy removal from suicidewatch was “shocking.”“For someone this high profile, with these allegations and this many victims,who has had a suicide attempt in the last few weeks, you can take absolutely nochances,” Lindsay explained. “You leave him on suicide watch until he’s out ofthere.”For Epstein, that would be a while. During a brief hearing on July 31, the FBIconfirmed that they were actively analyzing the evidence taken from Epstein’sManhattan residence and needed time to thoroughly explore all the material.Judge Berman set Epstein’s trial date for June 2020.Physically, Epstein showed up for the hearing that day; but mentally, thecriminal mastermind seemed to be elsewhere. The defendant’s notorious smirkinglips were stuck in neutral position. He wore thin-framed glasses and a dark blueprison uniform. His elbows rested on the courtroom table and his hands remainedlocked as if involuntarily begging. He said nothing, he did nothing, and heshowed no reaction to the proceedings. For those present, it was a jarringtransformation from the super-villain they’d seen before.“When I saw him come in, he looked out of it,” victims’ attorney Gloria Allredtold reporter Jen Heger about that day in court. “He looked tired, a little bitconfused. That’s not a surprise given conditions of jail, which are verydifferent than the home of a billionaire.”As FBI agents described the blackmail treasure trove they’d found in Epstein’sNew York home and on Little St. James, perhaps Epstein was conducting a mentaltour of his other properties and hideouts, inventorying what investigators wouldfind at each location—or rather, what he hoped they wouldn’t find.With lots of powerful friends, and even more powerful enemies, Epstein had towonder if someone would find it all and turn it in to guarantee their freedom.If the situation were reversed, he had to know he would.Less than thirty minutes after he arrived in the courtroom, Epstein was takenback through the passenger tunnel and locked in his cage.Summoning a desperate resolve, however, the evil sex villain decided that hestill had one more fight in him.On August 1, Epstein was granted a meeting with his longtime friend DavidSchoen, an Atlanta-based attorney.“Mr. Epstein had asked me to take over his defense and I agreed,” Schoen toldreporter Andy Tillett, “but subject to meeting with his longtime lawyers to seeif they would accept me in that role, or if I would have to put together my ownteam.”When Epstein and Schoen finished their lengthy meeting, they agreed to meetagain the following week.Schoen told Tillett: “We never had that meeting.”Schoen says Epstein was in good spirits, but several witnesses contend that overthe next few days, Epstein lost his grip. They described him as “disheveled” andreported that he was “sleeping on the floor . . . like a pig in a sty.”Had he lost it, or was that all another act? Or was he worried about somethingelse entirely?Whether he knew it or not, Epstein had only forty-eight hours to live.On August 8, he met with his attorneys to update his last will and testament.Epstein’s legal declaration protected his fortune in a sealed trust that couldonly be distributed to a named Trustee (or Trustees). That meant that onlyauthorized people were allowed to touch what was left of his estate—still ahealthy $500 million or more. Unless his victims were named as Trustees, theywouldn’t be able to recover any court settlements. It was the perfect plan.The executors would be his longtime lawyers, Darren K. Indyke and Richard D.Kahn. Each would receive $250,000 for their efforts. Oddly, Epstein namedbiotech entrepreneur and Harvard immunologist Boris Nikolic as a backup. Nikolicclaims he has no idea why Epstein would have named him in the document.However, the men once moved in similar circles. Nikolic was chief scientificadviser to Epstein friend Bill Gates, who had close ties to Epstein for manyyears.Gates has insisted, “I didn’t have any business relationship or close personalfriendship with him,” but a recently uncovered photograph shows Gates withNikolic inside Epstein’s NYC mansion, alongside former Treasury Secretary andPresident of Harvard, Larry Summers. The New York Times found that that visitwas one of several during 2011, with at least one continuing “late into thenight.” The paper reported that Gates emailed colleagues at the time: “Hislifestyle is very different and kind of intriguing although it would not workfor me.” (A rep claimed his email referred to Epstein’s interior design.)After his first visit to Epstein’s home, on January 31, 2011, Gates reportedlyemailed colleagues: “A very attractive Swedish woman and her daughter dropped byand I ended up staying there quite late.”That woman was reportedly former Ms. Sweden Eva Andersson-Dubin, and herfifteen-year-old daughter. Epstein appeared to have had an affinity for thegirl. At least two times in documents obtained from his home, the handwrittenphrase “Eva’s little girl on the boat,” appears, totally without any othercontext.The next month, Gates and Epstein were spotted chatting in Long Beach at the TEDconference. They were back in New York by May, when Gates again visitedEpstein’s home and bragged about it over email.Also at the May meeting was James Staley, a high-ranking JP Morgan official. JPMorgan and Gates’s foundation were then in talks to create the Global HealthInvestment Fund, which would support the development of health-relatedtechnologies around the world. Epstein was desperate to get involved, reportedlyinsisting to potential partners that his status as a registered sex offendershould not affect the potential deal: According to the New York Times, he saidat one gathering that his crimes had been “no worse than stealing a bagel.”That deal never materialized, but Epstein and Gates saw each other several timesin New York and Palm Beach as late as 2014. They did not see each other in theyears leading up to Epstein’s most recent arrest.Did Gates’s adviser stay in touch? He insists he was “shocked” to find himselfnamed as a backup executor for Epstein’s estate. No matter the logic behind thatchoice, Epstein’s decision to put his assets in a trust would lock the money ina special account. Its origins would be untraceable, and his agents couldutilize the funds for his defense, comfort, or even bribes. Epstein was takingpositive action, putting players and pieces in motion.The very next day, on August 9, Epstein was blindsided by a new threat: a courthad voted 2-to-1 to unseal all files relating to Virginia Roberts Giuffre’s 2017defamation lawsuit against Ghislaine. The voluminous document dump was fast andfurious, exposing the shocking extent of Epstein’s perversions and his networkof rich, famous, and powerful sexual predator pals. Everyone from Prince Andrewto the Palm Beach police were about to get taken down.Reporters scrambled to comb through the documents, finding new allegations andnew names, such as former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, billionaire GlennDubin, and former Democratic Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell. Robertsclaimed Epstein forced her to have sex with all those men—a claim they alldenied. The unsealing seemed like a shot across the bow to Epstein and hiscoconspirators. It was about to get ugly. Most of all, for Epstein.In his cell that evening, as Epstein pondered what horrors were to come, hiscellmate was not there. For some reason, Tartaglione had been moved to anotherunit, and Epstein had not been assigned another. Both of those developments werehighly unusual, and the reason for those decisions is unclear. No matter why,Epstein was alone—and no one was watching.During the overnight shift, MCC had eighteen guards holding down the entirefacility. Built for just 474 souls, the facility was known in recent years to bestuffed with up to eight hundred. As a result, many of the workers had to put inovertime. That night, the 9-South guards tasked with watching Epstein were onthat list. One had logged eighty hours that week working “doubles.” The otherwas a former correctional officer who volunteered to pick up shifts at theunderstaffed institution.Although both men were low-level staff members, they had to have known thatEpstein was the most vital to prosecutors. In addition, they could not have beenignorant of the fact that Epstein had almost died just days ago. Unfortunately,both coincidentally decided that something else was more important.For three hours beginning at 3:30 a.m., the 9-South guards failed to do sixmandatory visual checks on Epstein. These rounds were to occur every thirtyminutes. Not one happened. According to Bureau of Prisons officials, the twoguards happened to fall asleep at their posts, at the exact same time and forthe exact same duration.At approximately 6:20 a.m., the guards awoke and began their breakfast rounds.When they looked in on Epstein at 6:25, they saw the full weight of his bodysuspended by a bedsheet that was twisted around his doughy throat.The guards hurriedly entered the cell. One of them severed the knotted sheetthat connected the inmate to the top bunk while the other guard triggered analarm.They let Epstein drop like an anchor.The sex felon’s cold, rigid body had turned a chilling blue and he wasunmistakably lifeless. He had been dead for a while.Radios throughout the prison blasted, “Body alarm on South. Body alarm onSouth.”At 6:33 a.m., EMS took control of the situation and administered CPR. They knewimmediately, however, that there was no bringing him back.Nevertheless, Jeffrey Edward Epstein was taken to New York Presbyterian LowerManhattan Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 7:36 a.m.Even though Epstein was found hanged, his cause of death was listed as: “PendingFurther Study.”As his body was being wheeled to the medical examiner, a New York Post streetphotographer managed to snap one last scandalous photo of the monster.But even that would not be enough to convince the world that Epstein was dead.A verdict of suicide was not sufficient to answer the many lingering questions.Why was Epstein on suicide watch one week—and remarkably, off of it the next?Why, on the night of Epstein’s death, was his cellmate gone?Why would a suicidal man ever have been left alone?Why was the camera outside Epstein’s cell “broken”?Why did the guards fall asleep at exactly the same time, and then later falsifytheir logs?When the autopsy report was finalized, there were even more questions.New York City Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Barbara Sampson completed herexamination in roughly twenty-four hours, but then announced she was not readyto release her findings.“The ME’s (Medical Examiner’s) determination is pending further information atthis time,” she said in a public statement. “My office defers to the involvedlaw enforcement agencies regarding other investigations around this death.”The examiner also added this unusual tidbit: “At the request of thoserepresenting the decedent (Epstein), and with the awareness of the federalprosecutor, I allowed a private pathologist (Dr. Michael Baden) to observe theautopsy examination.”Epstein’s lawyers had asked Dr. Baden to confirm their client’s cause of death.The infamous former New York chief medical examiner had also been an expertwitness for O. J. Simpson during the football legend’s high-stakes murder trialin 1995, and was chairman of the House Select Committee on Assassinations’Forensic Pathology Panel that investigated the assassination of John F. Kennedy.The question on many minds was this: Why would Dr. Sampson need an observer?Did the dead man’s representatives fear she would tamper with the findings forsome unarticulated reason?Or did the estate hope to have a hand in shaping those findings for some purposeof their own?After carefully reviewing “all investigative information, including completeautopsy findings,” Dr. Sampson declared on August 16 that Jeffrey Epstein had,in fact, hanged himself.“In all forensic investigations, all information must be synthesized todetermine the cause and manner of death,” she stated. “Everything must beconsistent; no single finding can be evaluated in a vacuum.”The official story was that Epstein had secured one end of his bedsheet aroundhis neck. It would have been sturdy enough to do so, since he had been moved offsuicide watch, with its paper sheets. Then, the ME claimed, he tied the otherend to the top bunk in cell #123, and leaned forward.In the process, sources told the Washington Post, Epstein broke several bones inhis neck, including his hyoid, a small U-shaped bone above the Adam’s apple thathelps keep your throat open.That particular detail was explosive. Although a broken hyoid does occur in 27percent of suicides by hanging, it’s more often seen in cases where there isgreat force applied during the event, such as someone jumping from a height.That is, a hanging unlike Epstein’s supposed lean into death.Hyoid breaks are much more common in other incidents; they occur in 50 percentof all murders by strangulation.Questions swirled even faster with that revelation. Adding tension to the doubtand fear in the air, Epstein’s own family was not given a copy of the autopsyreport, leaving them unable to confirm or rule out the Post’s bombshellreporting.“We are not satisfied with the conclusions of the medical examiner,” Epstein’sattorneys said in a statement. “We will have a more complete response in thecoming days.”Even with so much at stake, the world and even Epstein’s family was forced towait. Nearly two weeks after the medical examiner released the findings of thereport, we learned from a source close to Epstein’s legal team that his familyhad not been given a copy of the official report.“Family lawyers were calling the NYC Medical Examiner daily,” the insider toldinvestigator Jen Heger. “It is extremely unusual to have issued a deathcertificate, but not to have given a copy of the autopsy report to the family.”“The family is entitled to a copy per New York law before it’s made public,” thesource added. “Clearly that did not happen in this case.”“The Medical Examiner just kept putting off the lawyers, saying, ‘It’s not readyyet,’ but the death certificate couldn’t have been issued without a completedautopsy report. It was clear they were stalling.”In the meantime, in response to growing public demand, United States AttorneyGeneral William Barr took action. Barr—the son of Epstein’s old Daltonpal—reassigned MCC Warden Lamine N’Diaye and the acting head of the US Bureau ofPrisons, Hugh Hurwitz.The MCC put the two negligent 9-South guards—whose names have been keptconfidential—on administrative leave. Criminal investigators subpoenaed over adozen MCC employees, as the Department of Justice vowed to uncover the truth.“We will get to the bottom of what happened, and there will be accountability,”an angry and embarrassed Barr told the public. “Let me assure you that this casewill continue on against anyone who was complicit with Epstein.”In the months to come, however, the news of the DOJ investigation was minimal.The public was left to decide on their own what really happened inside theMetropolitan Corrections Center that fateful night.In the course of this investigation, we spoke to dozens of people. When asked,every person close to the case believed at the time of this writing that hisdeath was NOT a suicide.EPSTEIN VICTIMS’ ATTORNEY GLORIA ALLRED: “At this point, I don’t feel there areenough facts to say definitively that it was suicide. Even though the medicalexaminer for the city of New York, who did the autopsy, has ruled that the causeof death was suicide, I’m not prepared to say without knowing all the facts andthat we can 100 percent conclude that it is suicide.“Again, there are more questions than answers, and I’m not going to engage in aconspiracy theory, but I would like to know what all the facts are. Now incourt, I did agree with the defense that their needs to be more of aninvestigation.“Even if we thought it was an attempted suicide attempt [the first time], thatshould have been a red flag to protect him. So, there are more questions thananswers at this point.“Why the three fractures in his neck consistent with suicide, but alsoconsistent with strangulation?“Why were the guards not checking every thirty minutes?“Why did he not have a cellmate at that time?“Were the guards’ records where they were supposedly monitoring him tamperedwith and changed?“Why would the guards, some of them, claim the Fifth and not provide interviewsto the investigators?“This is a major, major problem.EPSTEIN VICTIMS’ ATTORNEY LISA BLOOM: “I’m not ready to conclude that it wassuicide. The fact that he had just changed his will, I think a couple daysbefore, is significant to me that does point toward suicide. But . . . I’m goingto take it at face value, say, “He sure wasn’t acting like somebody who wasgoing to kill himself!” . . .“The injuries to his neck could have been from suicide. It also could have beenfrom somebody strangling him. I know from the many, many murder cases that Iused to cover on Court TV where I for eight years watched murder cases, amedical examiner saying it’s suicide, it’s really an opinion. And there areprobably also medical examiners who would say, “Well it’s not suicide.”“So I think there should be at least a second or a third opinion by an objectivemedical examiner. I think we should get to the bottom of it and there should bea full investigation.EPSTEIN VICTIMS’ ATTORNEY SPENCER KUVIN: “When Mr. Epstein was reported to bedeceased, my clients, obviously had some hesitation as to whether or not it wasaccurate or whether or not this was another disappearing act by Mr. Epstein,some elaborate scheme to be able to get out of all of this. . . .“Personally, knowing what I know about the system and about the jail that he wasin, there are a number of things that I question. Professionally and speakingwith people that have worked inside jails like this, I question, number one, howis it possible that they don’t have video of what occurred? I was contacted evenafter his supposed death by a guard that worked inside of the MCC that wasadamant that every section and square inch of that jail is covered by cameras.“We now know through reporting that at least two cameras were sent to the FBIcrime lab because they were supposedly broken or not working correctly. Youcouldn’t write it better in a crime novel, it just doesn’t make sense. A lot ofit doesn’t make sense.“It doesn’t make sense how he was taken off a suicide watch. It doesn’t makesense that his one cellmate that he had, that could have possibly preventedanything like this or been witness to something like this, was moved out just aday before the incident occurs.“It doesn’t make sense that two guards that are supposed to be watching him aresupposedly sleeping and just gone for hours. None of it makes sense.“I question, number one, most importantly, is it true? Did he somehow pull off aHoudini and somehow just disappear despite all of the reporting and despite allof the evidence that came out and despite all the information that’s out there?“Second, I question . . . who got paid? Because someone clearly, likely got paidoff. Someone, somewhere has got some secret account offshore that has a lot ofmoney in it now, that didn’t before he was dead. . . . whether someone actuallytook him out so that he couldn’t talk, so that he couldn’t tell stories that heknew about people who are powerful, rich, famous, royalty, whatever it may be,we’ll never know.“Unless, of course, there are some videos somewhere, again, that exist, that arein the hands of the federal government or the FBI of what happened inside thatjail on that morning.EPSTEIN FRIEND, ATTORNEY DAVID SCHOEN: “I also don’t believe it was suicide. Idon’t believe conspiracy theories either, but I don’t believe suicide forseveral reasons.”Interview after interview, we heard the most respected minds in the countryattest that Epstein’s death could not have been a suicide. Except, that is, forone: Epstein’s former attorney and friend Alan Dershowitz.We asked Dershowitz point-blank: “Do you believe these conspiracy theories thatsomebody else came in and killed him?”Dershowitz was unequivocal in his response:I’m not a conspiracy person. . . . The simplest, most obvious explanation isthat he decided he didn’t want to spend the rest of his life in prison. Hedidn’t think he was going to have a fair shot, and decided to take his own life.I think it would’ve been virtually impossible for anybody to get into theprison. If he had been with a cellmate, that might be different. But alone inthe prison, locked door, even with sleeping guards, I think the most likelyexplanation is the most obvious one, that he tried to kill himself and thenultimately succeeded.Even Dershowitz, however, had one caveat: “I think you should alwayssecond-guess any governmental investigation. I don’t think they’re going to findanything very different about the cause of death. I think that an investigationmight, however, find some things about the circumstances that would allow him totake his own life.”image [../Images/star.jpg]When it comes to the circumstances of Epstein’s death, the incident bears astriking similarity to the notorious death of one of the twenty-first century’smost famous Mossad agents.Ben Zygier was born in Australia in 1976, and reportedly became an agent of theMossad in the early 2000s, when he was working as a businessman in the MiddleEast. In early 2010, it was reported that he had been imprisoned in Israel forthreatening to expose other Mossad agents. The conditions of his confinementwere so secretive that he was known simply as “Mr. X” to guards.By the end of that year, Mr. X was dead, via “suicide.” Like Epstein, Zygier hadmet with his attorneys shortly before his death, and was said to be in goodspirits at the time. Despite a history of suicide attempts, he had been placedin a cell that was not suicide-proof, and had no cellmate. Supposedly, he usedhis sheet to tie a noose to the bars of his window, and killed himself byleaning forward. Members of the rescue crew claimed he had been able to do itout of view of the security cameras that swept his cell.Amid public outcry following his death, an Israeli judge conducted aninvestigation and found “orders had been given to prevent suicide” and “thesewere not upheld.” The judge also found strange bruises on Zygier’s body andtraces of a tranquilizer drug in his system. She ultimately concluded that she“could not rule out the intervention of another person who intentionally causedhis death.”At the end of it all, the Israeli government reportedly paid his family $1million.Despite rumors that Epstein’s death may have been a hit by the Mossad, themethod of his death does not seem to carry the fingerprints of Israel’s secretsecurity force, which tends to prefer simple shootings. In the list of confirmedIsraeli assassinations since 1970, there is not one incident of strangulation.(The Israeli government has a policy stating that targeted killings are legal.)What about other killer spies? The Kremlin obviously seems to prefer poisoning.The MI6 claims they do not carry out assassinations at all—a lie. The onlynation with a history of mysterious deaths by strangulation is one heavilylinked to Epstein: Saudi Arabia.At the time of this writing, the murder of Washington Post journalist JamalKhashoggi—strangled by a Saudi hit squad in an Istanbul embassy—still dominatesthe headlines. But it isn’t the first scandalous Saudi strangling.We have uncovered that way back in 1986, a Saudi Royal Family relative was foundstrangled to death in a hotel room across the Potomac River from Washington,D.C. An AP report at the time said police “had established no suspects ormotives in the slaying.”In February 2010, Saudi Prince Saud Abdulaziz bin Nasser al Saud was convictedof murder and sentenced to life in prison after strangling his aide to death ina hotel room. In 2013, he was flown back to Saudi Arabia, where it was said thathe would serve out the rest of his sentence.In 2011, well-known Shia spiritual leader Usama Al-Atar claimed he had beenstrangled nearly to death in prison after his arrest while making a hajjpilgrimage to Medina. Insisting his arrest had been motivated by religiousextremism, the Canadian citizen was later freed when his government intervened.Epstein’s links to Saudi Arabia during his time as an arms trader in the 1980sand early 1990s—led by Iran Contra kingpin Adnan Khashoggi—are beyond dispute.But new reporting has placed him in Riyadh even more recently.Flight data obtained by this investigative team shows that just hours before theUnited States 2016 election that would elect President Donald J. Trump,Epstein’s jet flew from Paris to Riyadh, where it landed at 6:35 p.m. localtime.Two days later, at 3:47 p.m. local time on November 9, the same aircraftdeparted the Saudi capital, flying in the opposite direction back to Paris. Atthe time, it would have been 8:47 a.m. in New York—not long before HillaryClinton would concede to Trump.Epstein’s friend and colleague, Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, was in Riyadh at thetime. (Epstein kept a personal photo of him in his Manhattan home.)Also in Riyadh over that period was Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who met with MBSand advisers on November 9.Epstein and Bezos were already acquaintances, having both attended the Edgefoundation “billionaire’s dinner” in 2011 and 2014, years after Epstein pleadedguilty to soliciting underage prostitution.It’s unclear if Epstein met with any of the men, or what he might have said.What aspect of the Trump/Clinton election would have necessitated an unusualquickie trip to Riyadh?What’s more, what aspect of Trump’s unthinkable win made it possible for Epsteinto return to Paris?If Clinton had been elected, would he have stayed in Saudi Arabia? He did have afake passport listing his residence as in the Middle Eastern country.Was Epstein afraid of the Clintons in the years before his arrest and death?Or someone else?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15ONCE UPON A TIME IN RUSSIAIn the hours and days following the announcement of Jeffrey Epstein’s death,people across America were watching closely for reports about what exactly hadhappened. So, it seems, was the Kremlin, also known as the lair of PresidentVladimir Putin.As the news broke, many social media accounts confirmed to be Russian bots beganactively promoting salacious and bizarre conspiracy theories surroundingEpstein’s death. The Russian state television channel, RT, led off one nightlybroadcast with some of the more outrageous claims. Even President Trump got inon the action, retweeting a post from conservative commentator Terrence K.Williams that read:Died of SUICIDE on 24/7 SUICIDE WATCH? Yeah right! How does thathappen#JefferyEpstein [https://twitter.com/hashtag/JefferyEpstein?src=hash] hadinformation on Bill Clinton & now he’s deadI see #TrumpBodyCount [https://twitter.com/hashtag/TrumpBodyCount?src=hash]trending but we know who did this!RT if you’re not Surprised#EpsteinSuicide[https://twitter.com/hashtag/EpsteinSuicide?src=hash] #ClintonBodyCount[https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClintonBodyCount?src=hash] #ClintonCrimeFamily[https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClintonCrimeFamily?src=hash]Senator Marco Rubio, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, confirmedthat Russian bots and trolls were actively promoting such outlandish theories.“The immediate rush to spread conspiracy theories about someone on the ‘otherside’ of partisan divide having him killed illustrates why our society is sovulnerable to foreign disinformation and influence efforts,” Rubio tweeted.“It’s sad (and frightening) to see so many Americans on both sides . . .unwittingly helping them,” he continued, adding that Putin “has weaponized ourpolarization.”But why would Putin have a stake in promoting conspiracy theories aboutEpstein’s death?In one interpretation, it could have been a simple smoke screen, meant toobscure the truth. In another, it could have been a deterrent aimed at anyoneasking further questions about the nature of his death.Who would publicly question the official suicide story when it would mean beinglumped in with a bunch of Kremlin bots? Having the courage to do so mightrequire some additional assurance, some inside proof.image [../Images/star.jpg]John Mark Dougan, a former Palm Beach County Deputy Sheriff, told our team thathe’s certain Epstein was murdered—and he knows why.“I don’t believe for one minute it was suicide,” he said.The world’s intelligence agencies couldn’t risk the chance of Epstein’sblackmail files ever going public, Dougan claims. Those files are explosive, andhe knows. Because he has them.Dougan served as a Deputy Sheriff in Palm Beach at the time Epstein was inprison after securing his secret plea deal. Now, he lives in Russia, where hehas been granted political asylum.Epstein’s prison time “was an absolute shitshow,” Dougan told author JamesRobertson from the dark streets of Moscow. “I’ll tell you why. He was able toleave jail basically anytime he wanted. Right? This is really unheard of.“But he was able to leave jail as long as he had two deputies go with him on anovertime detail. They were paid as an overtime detail. Now, overtime detail,this is Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office, by contract are selected out of arandom pool. This was different. These deputies that would go with him werehandpicked by the sheriff. And there were guys specifically who would look theother way while he was bringing underage girls into his office and into hishome. Unbelievable.”Palm Beach Police Detective Joseph Recarey had run the initial investigationinto Epstein’s crimes. But once in prison, the case was under the jurisdictionof the Sheriffs. Dougan says Recarey gave him full access to everything he knewabout the infamous inmate.“We basically had the entire case file,” he said. According to Dougan, Recareyalso gave him materials that were not in the “official” filings as well.When asked if he was aware of any blackmail tapes made by Epstein, Dougan wasunequivocal:Absolutely. They weren’t tapes so much as DVDs. I don’t know if these werefootages or not, but every bedroom in Epstein’s houses had multiple cameras inthem.He used to keep records of everybody. He used to store everything. So the PalmBeach Police Department, they knew that there were thousands and thousands ofthese DVDs. Except . . . Now, this is very interesting.When they went to search for them, they were gone.It’s not really a question of who would have had access. The question you shouldbe asking is: Who had knowledge that the search was coming? And the answer tothat is the Palm Beach County State Attorney’s Office and the Palm Beach CountySheriff’s Office. Because the State Attorney’s Office and Sheriff’s Office,they’re the ones who have to take the warrants and take them in front of thejudge to get them signed off. There were elements within these two organizationsthat didn’t want to see anything happen to Epstein.How far would Epstein’s protectors go to keep their prized asset safe?Joseph Recarey, the police officer who had original access to the blackmailfiles, died suddenly after a “brief illness” at the age of fifty in 2018.“It’s funny, because back in May when everything started to happen with Epsteinagain, when all the ruckus started to get raised again, he mysteriously died,”Dougan said. “I knew this guy, man. He was fit as a fiddle. He was fifty yearsold. And he died of a sudden illness. That’s what they wrote. ‘He died of asudden illness.’ It was unexplained.”Two years before, Dougan had fled for Russia, taking his own tranche of thetapes with him. He still has them today. Encrypted. Hidden.“Do I think that Epstein was probably put up to getting some wealthy people tosleep with some underage women so those people could be blackmailed by Westernintelligence agencies? Absolutely I do,” he said.Among those targets, Dougan claims, was Prince Andrew. A September 2019 reportin Britain’s Times of London revealed that the MI6 were “concerned that Russiamay have obtained kompromat, compromising material, on Prince Andrew.”Dougan insisted to our team that he is not a Russian asset. But in any case, theKremlin is likely very happy to have the Epstein blackmail files within theirborders.After the claims about Prince Andrew surfaced, Dougan released the followingstatement:Although we worked in different law enforcement agencies, former Town of PalmBeach Police Department Detective Joe Recarey, who was the lead detective on thesolicitation-of-minors case against billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, was a friend. Iwas shocked, as were family and friends, to learn of his unexpected death at age50 just over a year ago.Joe Recarey was very aware of my efforts to uncover breaches of public trust bythe Palm Beach County Sheriff’s office via my award-winning investigativewebsite. In late 2009 or early 2010, Joe asked me to scan all the documents aswell as copy hundreds of DVD disks he had on the Jeffrey Epstein case to keepthem safe. He had lost faith in Barry Krischer, the Palm Beach County state’sattorney at the time of the investigation. I would meet with him occasionally toget more documents to store, the last time being in 2015.I have never looked at what was given to me by Joe Recarey, other than the filenames, types, and sizes. The FBI seized my computers in 2016 which hadeverything Recarey gave me. The FBI and other intelligence agencies may besurprised to have discovered that I kept an off-site backup that was sent to mein 2017, after I was safely established in Russia.According to news reports, US intelligence agencies apparently analyzed thefiles and communicated with British authorities. If Britain’s SecretIntelligence Service, commonly known as MI6, has concerns about any ties betweenPrince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein, they got it from their Washingtoncounterparts, not me.Of course, this means the FBI has seen everything and has more knowledge of thecontents than I do because it was not my business to look deep into the files: Iwas simply acting as Joe Recarey’s computer “safety deposit box.” It also meansthat the FBI has the same exact data that I possess and are in a position toknow everyone who is implicated in the videos, recordings, and documents. Ifmedia reports are accurate, it seems the FBI has knowledge that Epstein filesinvolve Prince Andrew in some manner, since they made it a point to contact MI6and warn them.The Epstein data is encrypted in a TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt container and has beengiven to a few people. They cannot look at the contents because they do not havethe decryption keys. Others have the decryption keys, but they do not haveaccess to the encrypted containers. My contacts are on five continents and donot know each other. The Epstein files stay secure and unreadable to everyone. Ido not have a physical copy in my immediate possession, because of securityreasons.This is to make sure my family and friends remain safe. I have made arrangementsthat it can only be decrypted in the event of my arrest, if I go missing for anextended time, or in case of my unusual or untimely demise. I have a system inplace to connect people with the encrypted containers to those who have thedecryption keys.I have made elaborate security precautions because of ongoing legal issues,threats, and harassment. The FBI has tried to arrest me twice since I’ve been inMoscow by pushing Interpol via a sealed indictment. Both times they failed. Lastyear, the FBI sent 10 agents and Federal Marshals to a US company that I docontract work for, unsuccessfully trying to intimidate them.I will not be divulging any of the information I may know of or possess, becausethe secrecy of the data I have access ensures the safety of me and my lovedones. I hope the growing concerns and reports about Jeffrey Epstein’sinternational sex-trafficking empire, and his relationship with the rich andpowerful people like the Duke of York, will generate official and news mediainvestigations which will uncover all the facts.Not long after releasing that statement, Dougan took matters into his own hands,inviting journalist Ron Chepesiuk to review the materials and confirm theirexistence. A longtime friend of Dougan, Chepesiuk flew to Moscow on September24, 2019.There, according to Chepesiuk, Dougan cracked open the Epstein blackmail filesfor the very first time.“He just wanted to verify,” Chepesiuk told our team. “He suggested it and Isaid, ‘It’s to verify that they have something there.’ He said, ‘I’m not goingto show it to you long.’”What happened next shocked the journalist:So what happened was, it was less than five minutes, and a couple of randomscenes from the thing. It was obviously surveillance tape of a bedroom and therewere a couple of younger, may even have been underage, I don’t know, they werevery young.It was far away and it looked like it was coming from a wall. The camera and allthat. It looked like surveillance in a TV show. So I just assumed that it wascoming from a camera probably facing, on a wall.”And there was some older men and I didn’t look at them. It was very hard to seeit from afar. I wanted to, but they were definitely dealing with some sex, youknow? So that was it. Then he closed it up, and took it again and saved whateverhe was doing. I didn’t want to know.I didn’t want to have the responsibility of trying to identify people so Iwasn’t really interested in trying to identify people. I just wanted to look atit and verify that it was what it looked like, surveillance tapes.Pretty disgusting. Didn’t want to be a voyeur. I’m not into that sort of thing.That was it. That was it. It was verified, and that was it.I guess he wanted to have somebody else say that he had them. We had developed agood working relationship and he trusted me. He just wanted to verify that,because I don’t think he ever looked at the tapes until that moment because hegot them from this guy in law enforcement in Palm Beach. He never, what I cangather, really was interested in the contents.He was a straight shooter, he gave his word that he would take care of them, andthat’s what he did. But he wasn’t really interested in what was going on inside.But he’s been forced to pay more attention to it because of what broke inEngland with the Prince Andrew connection.That’s also the reason, Dougan says, that he fears for his life.“Now I have the very peculiar problem of worrying about being hunted down byMI6,” he claimed.Chepesiuk said that during his visit, there were indeed red flags.“John said that he noticed a car following him,” he recalled.“Here in Moscow there’s a lot of twists and turns so if you’re moving, twistingand turning and here’s a car that’s always on your, always in sight, you beginto wonder if that car is following you.”“John said the car was behind him right back into the city. It’s about thirty orforty kilometers. It’s way out there that the alternative airport route inMoscow. So it was a long journey to have this car in the back of you all thisway.”Dougan says he’s right to be concerned. Recarey’s sudden death in 2018—at theage of fifty—shocked those who knew him, as well as those who have followed theEpstein case.Few people have noted, however, that he was not the only mysterious death in thePalm Beach area during that period. In April 2018, almost exactly one monthbefore Recarey’s death, attorney Alan Ross, who represented an Epstein victim inthe early civil suits, died of a similarly fast-acting cancer at agesixty-eight.Before that, the houseman who cleaned Epstein’s sex toys, Alfredo Rodriguez,died of a fast-acting, six-month cancer in 2015, almost exactly at the same timeas Virginia Roberts Giuffre’s civil case brought the Epstein story—and PrinceAndrew’s part in it—back into the open. He was only sixty.“Of course, he knew all about Prince Andrew,” Rodriguez’s widow, Patricia Dunnsaid at the time.Recarey’s Floridian wife told Epstein: Dead Men Tell No Tales that he passedfrom cancer, too.Was it just a coincidence that these three men, all in Florida, died similardeaths that seemed timed to developments in the Epstein case? Poisoning byarsenic, heavy metals, and radioactive substances are all known to cause cancerin humans.Dougan says he’s not taking any chances. His family left behind in the UnitedStates, he wonders if he’ll ever see them again.“Look, somebody has to expose the evil people, I guess you would say. Somebody’sgotta do it, right? And somebody has to pay the price. Am I happy that I’ve donewhat I’ve done? Yeah. I’m very happy with what I’ve done so far.”“But now you’re asking me, is it worth it for me to have lost my children? Idon’t know, man. I mean, no.”With the blackmail tapes now in the Kremlin’s grasp and with the potential tocirculate worldwide, some now have a lot more to lose."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16THE COCONSPIRATORSLess than six months before the 2016 election, reporters covering thepresidential campaign trail were rocked by an incoming missile: An anonymouswoman listed as “Katie Johnson” filed a lawsuit in California accusing Epsteinof raping her at his Manhattan home back in 1994, when she was just thirteen.The claims were similar to those in other lawsuits that had been filed againstEpstein in the past, except for one thing: Donald Trump was listed as an allegedcoconspirator and fellow rapist.The moment the lawsuit came across our collective computer screens in thenewsroom of employer American Media, Inc., our team sprang into action. AuthorHoward summoned reporters Melissa Cronin, Doug Montero, Sharon Churcher, GinaBacchiocchi, and Robert Hartlein to investigate.Court documents listed Johnson’s address in Twentynine Palms, California, notfar from author Cronin’s Palm Springs home. Speeding out to knock on Johnson’sdoor, Cronin’s mind raced with questions: Who would she find there? Aftercovering Epstein’s crimes for years, would this be the moment to crack it allopen?Flying through the desert in her car on speakerphone with the reporting team inNew York, Cronin turned onto a dusty side street. She had beaten every otherreporter there. But she didn’t find Johnson. Instead, at the lawsuit’s addresswas a boarded-up, abandoned home. Neighbors called it a “crack house,” and saidit had most recently been occupied by squatters.Canvassing businesses in the small, windswept town, Cronin found that no one hadever heard of a “Katie Johnson,” nor knew anything about the lawsuit, Epstein,or Trump. Indeed, a “neighbor,” Danny Mira, told us that no one had lived at thehome since its owner, David Stacey, died in October the year prior.Mira said he and other neighbors had kept a close watch on the home because itwas overrun by drug addicts who squatted there while Stacey was hospitalized inthe final days of his life.The neighbors, with the help of police, managed to clean up the home severalmonths before Stacey’s death. Sharon Rose, a local Realtor, told us the propertywent into default shortly after Stacey’s death and was officially taken over bythe bank on April 11—fifteen days before the woman filed her suit.What’s more, the phone number the woman listed on the court documents was notconnected, and she also told the court she had less than $300 to her name insavings.It was clear the lawsuit was some kind of a red herring. Speculation ran wild:Had the Clintons planted this to smear Trump and torpedo his campaign? Had Trumpplanted this in a canny bit of reverse psychology? (I.e. If the suit weredismissed for being fake, other claims against him would seem fake andillegitimate as well.)The truth was even stranger. The man behind the Katie Johnson lawsuit was aformer Jerry Springer producer who called himself “Al Taylor,” a.k.a. notoriousgossip peddler Norm Lubow. (Lubow was also behind a 2011 story that claimedJustin Bieber had impregnated a fan, Mariah Yeater.)Lubow’s wingman was a conservative antiabortion donor, Steve Baer, who alsohappened to be a “Never Trumper.” Taylor claimed to have met Johnson and heardher story at a party several years before.Her attorney, Tom Meagher, said she was motivated to come forward at last, withTaylor’s backing, to ensure that her rapist would not become president.Trump’s team told author Howard the accusations in the lawsuit were“unequivocally false” and “politically motivated.” Even for Trump skeptics, theentire lawsuit seemed fishy from the start.First, why had she filed from a nonexistent address? Why had no one seemed tohave ever met her?An attorney that represented Johnson admitted even he had trouble tracking herdown. For reporters, it was just as difficult.Journalist Emily Shugerman said Johnson’s reps promised her a video interviewwith the plaintiff, only to cancel on her several times. Were we all beingcatfished?Armed with this information, author Howard told attorney Lisa Bloom that our owninvestigation was turning up red flags, and warned Bloom of a lack ofcorroborating evidence. These types of conversations are routine in the world ofjournalism, and New York Times reporters have revealed that they also warnedBloom in this case.Bloom waded in regardless, and announced that she would unveil Johnson at apress conference in November 2016, just days before the election.When the hour came, Johnson was nowhere to be found.“Jane Doe has received numerous threats today. . . . She has decided she is tooafraid to show her face,” Bloom told the gathered reporters. “We’re going tohave to reschedule.”The case was soon dismissed in California for procedural issues, and “Johnson”refiled in New York, only to drop it again.Today, many still believe that the Katie Johnson suit was another case of avictim silenced by the crushing jaws of the justice system, another cleverescape for Epstein and Trump.However, our team has been unable to confirm that “Katie Johnson” ever existed.For us, the whole caper is eerily reminiscent of the conspiracy trolls thatsurfaced after Epstein’s death. Plant one crazy fake lawsuit about an Epsteincoconspirator, and all the other potential revelations seem just as insane byassociation.When approached in an effort to learn the truth about Johnson, Taylor toldHoward: “You know I have details about the Clintons’ involvement in the wholeKatie Johnson affair.” He refused to go on further for fear of retribution fromthose involved in what he characterized as a fictitious scheme.By the time “Katie” had first appeared in 2016, however, Epstein’s realcoconspirators must have been getting nervous.Depositions in the Jane Doe case and Virginia Roberts Giuffre’s lawsuitcontinued to reveal new allegations and names on an almost weekly basis. In2015, Giuffre’s claims against Prince Andrew had dropped a bombshell onBuckingham Palace (claims he, of course, denied).image [../Images/star.jpg]Ever since Epstein’s 2008 plea deal secured immunity for his “unnamedco-conspirators,” the world had wondered who those people were. With his deathin August 2019, it seemed as if the world might never know.For Epstein victim Michelle Licata, it was chilling:He wouldn’t have been able to commit suicide. Would he have been able to bemurdered? Sure.I mean, there are a lot of people that are just walking around like, ‘You needto shut this down. . . . He is blowing my cover,’ is what it felt like.It was like all these people’s dirty secret started coming out one after anotherafter another. I can see those people that are the people that are paying tokeep themselves out of jail and out of prison.Those people are like, “Look I don’t care what it takes. You need to shut thisup. You need to, I don’t know, make him disappear. Make the story disappear.Make these girls be quiet.” That’s what’s happening.I mean, it seems like they are letting us talk, but that’s what’s happening.Will those coconspirators let the victims keep talking forever? Thisinvestigation has learned of death threats to at least one victim who spoke outrecently.In addition, victim Alicia Arden told us that she fears she has been blacklistedfrom working in the entertainment world since filing her police report.“I feel that I may have been blacklisted by Jeffrey Epstein’s network. Ithought, did someone say something? ‘Oh we don’t want to work with Alicia,because if we do anything to her, she’ll go file a police report.’ So I thoughtthat that could have blacklisted me a little,” she told author Cronin.“Because the girls that you see now, that have other Hollywood predators in thenews, I don’t see them working very much. They’ve brought up what happened tothem, and they’ve talked about what happened to them, and they’ve beenblacklisted. Why shouldn’t we be able to come out and talk about that?”Meanwhile, the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, atleast, has vowed to continue the fight to bring coconspirators to justice.On the day of Epstein’s death, Manhattan US Attorney Geoffrey Berman released astatement that said: “To those brave young women who have already come forwardand to the many others who have yet to do so, let me reiterate that we remaincommitted to standing for you, and our investigation of the conduct charged inthe Indictment—which included a conspiracy count—remains ongoing.”Attorney Gloria Allred revealed to our team:When I was in court while we were waiting for the court hearing to begin, Ispoke with the United States Attorney, Mr. Berman, before the hearing began, andI introduced him to my client in the courtroom, and he did assure them in mypresence and he assured me that they are continuing their investigation of anypotential co-conspirators.We should always keep in mind that when Mr. Epstein was indicted in this latestproceeding, there also in the indictment was not only the indictment of Mr.Epstein but the indictment also talked about unnamed co-conspirators. So evenbefore his death, the Justice Department was interested in that.And it maybe that now that he is deceased, more victims will be more willing tospeak about who may have been in that chain to recruit them, to manage them, topay them.Allred also noted that as the search for evidence continues, it may turn up newnames—and more proof.“I understand there’s a grand jury that has been looking into the circumstancesof Mr. Epstein’s death,” she told us.“There are many civil cases that are and will be ongoing, seeking discovery,seeking to find out the truth, and then there’s the criminal investigation,which is probably more powerful than anything else, because the United Statesgovernment has more resources than anyone else has.“So I don’t think any businessperson or celebrity or powerful man should resteasy and think, “Oh, well, there’s not enough evidence.”“Well, maybe there is.”Indeed, two weeks after Epstein’s death, authorities in France announced thatthey were launching their own investigation into sex crimes that might haveoccurred in Epstein’s Paris home. In September 2019, they raided the poshapartment near the Arc de Triomphe, as well as the home and offices of hisassociate, modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel. Brunel was named as a coconspiratorin the unsealed Virginia Roberts Giuffre documents. He founded the MC2 modelingagency in 2005, reportedly with $1 million in seed money from Epstein.Phone messages to Epstein from Brunel, found in Epstein’s Palm Beach home andobtained by this team, suggest that Brunel may have connected Epstein with youngmodels. The undated messages from Brunel to Epstein, as captured by Epstein’sassistants, read:He just did a good one . . . She spoke to me and said, “I love Jeffrey.”Jean-Luc “is in serious conversation about Alina’s butt and he needs yourprecision.”“He has a teacher for you to teach you how to speak Russian. She is 2X8 yearsold not blonde. Lessons are free and you can have your 1st today if you call.”“Jean Luc spoke to the doctor about your symptoms. It’s Bratislavian various. Itcan be cured but you have to move. It can cause atrophy of the muscle which canshorten your sex life.”The day we submitted this manuscript to the publisher, Brunel announced that hewas willing to work with French prosecutors. On that day, his location was stillunknown.Homayra Sellier, the president of sex-trafficking-prevention organizationInnocence in Danger, was behind the push for the investigation in France.She explained:We had women who came forward and they wanted to have juridical help to see whatcould be done with their testimonies, with their stories in France,” she said,“in order to be a good citizen and to respect their duty as a mother, as awoman, as a citizen. So, they were guided to our juridical team, and they wereforwarded at the discretion of the prosecutors and those who are doing theinvestigation.In general terms, I believe that one of them concerns Mr. Epstein. Maybe alsomore, the other partners, or the other friends of his.From my understanding, when he was operating in Paris, in France, it was veryvery very similar to the way he was operating in the rest of the world. He hadfriends who were recruiting young girls for modeling. Many of them wererecruited to do those so-called massages, and they were going to his house.Then, once they were there . . . it was not a massage; at least, not for all ofthem.I think his activity in France must have been quite big. I do think he hadfriends, maybe others who were putting him in touch with models.Honestly, I think what happened in France is very, very, very similar to whathappened in the US. You know this black book that was found or given orwhatever? In that black book, there are apparently over sixty, seventy names ofFrench people and there is a big number of women who are named as masseuses. Butthis is very similar to those who were going to his house in New York. So, it’sthe same operating system because it worked for him there, why would he changeit?According to Selliers, coconspirators around the globe could be exposed.“I am not sure that the investigations will stop with the US and France,” shesaid. “I had a call from some people who live in Belgium, and they were sayingthat people would like to expand the course of action in Belgium. Maybe thenGermany. There were German models who were friends of Mr. Epstein, and who weregoing in his house, going to his parties. Even hosting parties with him.”Criminal investigations are not the only hope for future justice, however.Several victims have already filed civil lawsuits in the hopes of gettingclosure—or cash—from Epstein’s estate. Gloria Allred, Lisa Bloom, and SpencerKuvin all represent victims continuing the fight, and each said that Epstein’scoconspirators should not think for a second that they’re off the hook.“To the men in power, I hope they’re afraid,” Bloom said.Allred, her mother, warned that more lawsuits are on the way:Victims should know that they can file a civil lawsuit as a Jane Doe. That isour plan, at least for most if not all of our victims. We’re going to be filingas Jane Does.Members of the public do not need to know who they are, and they won’t know whothey are. Of course, a defendant has the right to know who’s suing him, but thepublic does not need to know.Shockingly, Epstein’s coconspirators are trying to co-opt that strategy fortheir own devious devices. On September 3, 2019, an unnamed “John Doe” filedcourt papers begging a judge to block his name from being released in the eventthat Virginia Roberts Giuffre succeeded in unsealing more documents from hercivil lawsuits.The mysterious John admitted he didn’t even know if he would be mentioned in thedocuments, but he would be taking no chances. His attorneys said they knew theexplosive filings could include a “range of allegations of sexual acts involvingthe Plaintiff and non-parties to this litigation, some famous, some not; theidentities of non-parties who either allegedly engaged in sexual acts withPlaintiff or who allegedly facilitated such acts.” His attorneys did not confirmwhether Doe could be considered famous or not.Aside from Epstein’s famous friends, his former staffers and “recruiters” likeGhislaine Maxwell are also now stalked by the searchlight as they hide outaround the world.One, Nadia Marcinkova (a.k.a. Nadia Marcinko), was yet another pretty youngblonde in Epstein’s roster of sex slaves. Brought from Yugoslavia at the age ofsixteen, she quickly became one of Epstein’s favorite companions.During the Palm Beach investigation, a sixteen-year-old victim told cops thatEpstein had forced her to perform oral sex on Marcinkova. Still, when policeswooped in on Epstein, Marcinkova was spared. His non-prosecution agreementspecifically named her as a coconspirator who would receive immunity fromfurther prosecution, along with other alleged victims-turned-­recruiters,Adriana Ross, and Sarah Kellen. (His assistant, Lesley Groff, was also named.)That immunity agreement is only valid, however, in Southern Florida—not NewYork.When asked about Marcinkova’s role in the global sex ring, and whether she couldbe prosecuted, her attorneys told the New York Times: “Like other victims, NadiaMarcinko is and has been severely traumatized” and “needs time to process andmake sense of what she has been through before she is able to speak out.”Marcinkova was unique among Epstein’s girls in that she was able to attractattention outside of his inner circle. She trained as a pilot under hissponsorship, and built a huge YouTube following as the sassy and sexy “GlobalGirl.” Now, other female pilots and aviation community members are disgusted tolearn about what she may have witnessed or done.“What Nadia Marcinko knows is a lot,” said Florida air safety investigatorChristine Negroni. “She has seen everything. When we talk about Jeffrey Epsteinand the kind of information he took to the grave, he is not the only one who hasthat kind of information.”Negroni continued in an exclusive interview:She is also very, very aware of what happened in that house and his network ofpeople, many of whom flew on his airplanes, many of whom have been reported tohave participated in some of these activities.It’s a tough spot for her to be in. I don’t know: is she perpetrator? Is shevictim? Reports suggest she came to the United States at the age of fourteen andthat there were documents that suggested Epstein bought her from Slovakia at theage of fourteen.So it’s very hard for me, and I hope for everyone, to be judgmental about awoman who may have facilitated these horrible crimes on young women when sheherself might have been a victim. She seems to have made the best out of a badsituation. Whether that should be held against her I don’t know.She has a heck of a story to tell. The question is whether she’ll tell it.Of course, perhaps the only person who knows the whole story—from sextrafficking to espionage and everything in between—is Ghislaine Maxwell.Conveniently, at the time of this writing, she seems to have disappeared intothin air.Days after Epstein’s death, it was reported that she had been living in thequiet Massachusetts fishing village of Manchester-by-the-Sea, in the mansion offormer boyfriend Scott Borgerson.While Ghislaine was on the run, Epstein victim, Jennifer Araoz, filed a newlawsuit against her, alleging: “Maxwell participated with and assisted Epsteinin maintaining and protecting his sex trafficking ring, ensuring thatapproximately three girls a day were made available to him.”But when reporters swarmed the Massachusetts seaside town, Ghislaine was alreadygone—if she’d ever even been there in the first place.Our reporters went on the hunt in Europe and the United States. Then suddenly,there was a wholly unexpected twist: The New York Post published a photo ofGhislaine gazing defiantly at the camera while sitting at a Los AngelesIn-N-Out, burger and fries in front of her.Supposedly, the image had been taken by a lucky bystander who happened torecognize the woman who was then the world’s most wanted.But once you looked closer at the image, strange details began to emerge.First, Ghislaine had a book in front of her: The Book of Honor: The Secret Livesand Deaths of CIA Operatives. It hardly seems like it could have been acoincidental choice. More likely, it was a pointed message to someone—oreveryone.Second, an advertisement in the background showed an ad for the movie Good Boys,a raunchy comedy in which preteens make R-rated sex jokes. The ad had beenphotoshopped into the image. The real ad at that location was for a localhospital.There was also another clue that told family friend Laura Goldman that it wasall a setup: “When I saw the picture of Ghislaine Maxwell at In-N-Out, I knew itwas a fake immediately because she doesn’t eat. Jeffrey liked thin women, so shestarved herself to death. There was no way she was eating a hamburger and frenchfries!”Later, a source would confirm to our team that the middleman—or middle woman,rather—who peddled the photo to the paper is a high-end Beverly Hills Realtorwith property listings in Israel.“I just talked to someone who texted with Ghislaine,” Goldman revealed. “Soshe’s definitely not in American witness protection. I think she’s out of thecountry.”Goldman is sure of one thing: Someone has helped Ghislaine go deep, deepunderground. Was it her spy handlers?“If you know the Maxwell family, you know they’re their own little team,”Goldman said. “The seven siblings and Mrs. Maxwell supported each othercompletely.“Ghislaine’s sister Isabel has been married three times,” Goldman said. “Herlast husband also died mysteriously. They liked larger-than-life men.”Men, like their father, who had ties to international intelligence agencies.image [../Images/star.jpg]Really, if you dig deep enough, the most powerful men of the twentieth centurydo have that one trait in common. While not all agents themselves, like Epstein,nearly without exception the leading figures of our time are connected byshadowy threads to the web of international intelligence, sexual blackmail, andthe trafficking and abuse of children.In a riveting series for MintPress.com [http://MintPress.com], Chileanjournalist Whitney Webb traced sexual blackmail practices back to 1920s and1930s America, when leading liquor salesman Stan Rosenstiel hosted bugged“blackmail parties” with young boys for party favors. Rosenstiel invited therich and powerful, for very specific reasons. Webb cites a Florida Sun Sentinelreport that alleges Rosentiel was once overheard saying “if the government everbrings pressure” against him or his pal, notorious mafioso Meyer Lansky, he’duse his recordings as blackmail.During World War II, such techniques became more mainstream as the USintelligence community looked to mobsters and underworld kings for techniques tohelp them win against the Nazis. After the war, the wise guys’ participationearned them a lifetime of “get out of jail free” cards.Meanwhile, Lansky didn’t limit himself to connections with and favors for theCIA. The shadowy character also worked with leading figures of the Mossad tolaunder money in the Middle East.Supposedly, Lansky’s own sexual blackmail ring was responsible for obtainingblackmail photos of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, leading to even more lenienttreatment of Lansky and his associates throughout the 1950s and 1960s.Although a victim himself, Hoover also was famous for collecting blackmail fileson leading Americans, including the members of Camelot—the Kennedy family, andspecifically President John F. Kennedy. Did he learn the tactic from America’soriginal blackmailer, Rosenstiel? Hoover and the liquor baron were closefriends, and Rosenstiel even donated $1 million to the J. Edgar HooverFoundation.Both men cultivated a mentorship of rising young politico Roy Cohn—DonaldTrump’s future mentor. Cohn became Senator Joseph McCarthy’s adviser, and laterworked with Ronald Reagan’s administration. His meteoric rise through the ranksof the American elite, it seems, was due to his own “blackmail parties.”Rosenstiel’s fourth wife, Susan Kaufman, later claimed to have attended one suchparty in 1968 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. Kaufman said that in additionto Hoover himself in drag (going by the name “Mary”) she saw young boys engagingin sexual behavior with Hoover, Cohn, and her then-husband.Multiple reports claim that Cohn was unapologetic about hosting the gatherings,insisting that they were part of his anti-Communist crusade.As with Epstein, Webb writes, many turned a blind eye to Cohn’s activities. Hewas simply too connected, and had too much dirt, to take down.Trump’s former adviser Roger Stone explained: “Roy was not gay. He was a man wholiked having sex with men. Gays were weak, effeminate. He always seemed to havethese young blond boys around. It just wasn’t discussed. He was interested inpower and access.”Donald Trump would later buy Cohn’s party palace, the Plaza, and host his owndebaucherous bashes there throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Male model AndyLucchesi told reporter Michael Gross that such parties were populated by “a lotof girls . . . 14, look 24. That’s as juicy as I can get. I never asked how oldthey were. I just partook.”But Cohn’s influence, like Epstein’s, spanned both sides of the political aisle.His cousin, Dick Morris, was a close adviser to Bill Clinton. Cohn hadconnections in media, too: He was friends with FOX News head honcho RupertMurdoch, and called Barbara Walters his “wife.” His high school the pals turnedfriends for life included Si Newhouse Jr., Generoso Pope Jr. of the NationalEnquirer, and Richard Berlin, who owned Hearst. Many of Cohn’s connections wouldlater become close with Jeffrey Epstein as well.Roy Cohn died in 1986, but sexual blackmail—including the trafficking ofchildren—would continue to permeate the highest levels of American society.In June 1989, George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush were photographed visiting theCovenant House, a Catholic charity for homeless kids in Manhattan. It had beenfounded under the direction of Cohn’s friend and frequent party guest, CardinalFrancis Spellman. Bush’s Yale roommate, Robert Macauley, was on theorganization’s board. (His AmeriCares foundation funded Covenant House, whilealso working with the CIA to fund the Contras in South America. Like Epstein,Macauley lived in Palm Beach.)Just weeks after the presidential pair’s visit, Covenant House was the topic ofa jaw-dropping exposé by the New York Post, which alleged that extensive childsex abuse had happened there.That same year, the Washington Post reported that former NBC News correspondentCraig Spence had been caught running a D.C. child sex ring that providedunderage sex slaves to powerful men in apartments that were bugged and riggedwith security cameras. Even his parties, which hosted members of the Reagan andBush administrations, had been bugged for gathering blackmail material. Spenceeven brought his prisoners to the White House for late-night encounters (notwith the president).Like Epstein, Spence often boasted to his friends and colleagues that he wasworking for the CIA. Also like Epstein, after his dirty deeds were exposed,Spence was found dead—supposedly by suicide.image [../Images/star.jpg]For many, Epstein seems like a singular monster; at least, upon first encounter.A personification of evil that is deeper and darker than our society has everknown. Ultimately, however, the painful truth is that he was really nothingspecial.Epstein’s predecessors were many. Over the course of decades, none of them werestopped.With Epstein gone, we are forced to face the sad fact that he will not be thehistoric first in this dark saga to face justice. As he joins the trail ofheartbreak started by his predecessors, we are left to ask: Who are hiscontemporaries in sexual blackmail and the exploitation of children forespionage? And who are his successors?Somewhere, it is certain, there are people who consider themselves to be theheirs to Epstein’s darkest legacy: whether male or female, American or foreign,working for the CIA, MI6, or the Mossad.Some we may suspect. Others will never raise the slightest hint of impropriety.Some we may even know.It was not possible to stop Epstein, even with all of the stories we wrote andall of the brutal facts we exposed while he was living.It may not even be possible to unravel his entire twisted life and networkwithin the span of our lifetimes.Dead men tell no tales, but we are compelled to tell them: stories of crimes, ofconspiracies, of darkness.In addition, we are compelled to listen: to those who missed the red flags, tovictims whose lives were changed in an instant.It is only in doing so that we can raise the slightest hope, the slightestchance, that we may ever stop the ones who wish to follow in Epstein’sfootsteps."},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUEIn the final days and hours of completing this book, disturbing new discoveriesabout the crimes and connections of Jeffrey Epstein continued to surface.Even after reporting on him together for years, we found deeper and deeperlayers of deception than we had ever known. As we gathered in team researchingand writing sessions, the silence would be broken every few moments by one of ussaying, “Oh my God.”There isn’t time or space to connect and reveal every single detail wediscovered. (Although, we’ll probably spend the rest of our lives trying.) Thisbook represents the best and most compelling reporting that we’ve ever done onEpstein and his cohorts. But this epilogue represents one of the spine-tinglingstories that made our jaws drop when we discovered it—a story that could havebeen a book all on its own.The summary is this: Donald Trump’s personal fixer Michael Cohen and JeffreyEpstein are both tied to a company called Reporty (now named Carbyne), which wasthen in the early stages of creating a new spy-like technology.(Convicted felon Cohen plead guilty on August 21, 2018, to eight counts,including campaign finance violations, tax fraud, and bank fraud. Cohen said heviolated campaign finance laws at the direction of Trump and “for the principalpurpose of influencing” the 2016 presidential election. In November 2018, Cohenentered a second guilty plea for lying to a Senate committee about efforts tobuild a Trump Tower in Moscow. In December 2018, he was sentenced to three yearsin federal prison and ordered to pay a $50,000 fine.)The stated purpose of Epstein and Cohen’s business alliance in Carbyne was tohelp 911 callers by connecting the dispatch system to their cellphones’microphone, GPS, and camera, giving the dispatcher a live feed of the caller’ssurroundings. The obvious implication is that the same technology could easilybe used to execute widespread spying and blackmail, to an extent the world hasnever before seen.The explosive story of Carbyne’s background was first published by reporters ZevShalev and Tracie McElroy of Narativ.org [http://Narativ.org].In September 2017, Russian billionaires Viktor Vekselberg and Andrew Intraterbought 24 percent of Carbyne’s most valuable stock options, through Intrater’scompany Columbus Nova.(Intrater donated $250,000 to Trump’s inauguration fund, and has already donatedthousands to his 2020 campaign. His company also paid Cohen half a milliondollars in “consulting fees.” He was investigated by Robert Mueller’s SpecialCounsel team.)In 2015, the Times of Israel reported, Ehud Barak had formed a limitedpartnership company called Sum and bought all of Reporty’s Series A stock—withmost of the millions he needed to do so coming from Jeffrey Epstein. (It wasn’tthe first time he’d gotten millions thanks to Epstein. In 2004, Barak receivedabout $2.4 million from Leslie Wexner’s Wexner Foundation, where Epstein wasboth a trustee and major donor.)Barak’s cash infusion was enough to win him a seat as chairman of the board atReporty, now Carbyne. The company is now based in Tel Aviv.(In a twist that is sure to titillate Tom Brady haters, the Kraft Group is alsoa major investment source.)In 2019, Carbyne partnered with Windbourne Consulting, a mysterious company thatcalls itself a “leader in public safety communications consulting and projectmanagement services to international, federal, state and local governments.”Their headquarters is a mere five minutes away from the Pentagon.Calling the technology “Smart911,” Windbourne has already implemented Carbyne inthe United States. Although, they may not want you to know about it.A May 2017 Windbourne newsletter touted the platform’s rollout in Michigan,announcing that the governor there had dedicated $2.2 million in grant fundingto make the technology available to all residents. Anyone who put Smart911 ontheir phone and gave it access to their camera, mic, and GPS would get aneighteen-month subscription for free, the newsletter explained. The company alsotouted an oddly suspicious story from 2014, where a Michigan man who justhappened to have Smart911 already installed was saved from a fire because of theapp. The government and company encouraged all residents to download it.But sometime after June 2019, in the weeks leading up to Epstein’s arrest, thatnewsletter was wiped from the Windbourne website.You may not have heard of it, but “Smart911” already has been implemented bylocal governments—and put on Americans’ cellphones—in South Carolina, Ohio,Kentucky, Florida, Arkansas, New York, California, Massachusetts, Hawaii andmore. According to Windbourne, Smart911 is in forty states at the time of thiswriting.Newer versions of Smart911 reportedly also can access your personal photos,medical and health information, and other details.The company insists, “It is NOT the goal of Smart911 to spy on you or share yourinformation with anyone or any organization without cause.”The only consolation in the twisted story of Jeffrey Epstein may be that in thefuture, exploitative spies like him will probably become obsolete. Instead,we’ll willingly gather intelligence on ourselves.In 2020, who needs the classic honey trap when you’ve got the app?"}]
