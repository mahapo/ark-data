The author, Mr. G. Edward Griffin, has performed an outstanding service in giving the people of the free world a picture of what has happened, is happening, and will happen in the very near future--if we continue our course of strategic surrender to in ternational forces. The book opens with the story of Katanga and reveal s the broken promises which the UN made to Moise Tshombe in order to deceive him, and to turn over to the central government the only province of the Congo where law and order had prevailed and where freedom was the watchword of its leaders. The murder, pillaging and rape practiced b y the UN forces in Katanga can happen to any country that surrenders to UN control. Author Griffin outlines in considerable detail the Communist infiltration into the personnel at every echelon of the UN, and he exposes the treachery and subversion that flourishes there. The author meticulously outlines the grand design f or surrender, and likens it to a jigsaw puzzle. The chief designer is well aware of the ultimate pictur e, but an individual working on an indiscernible pi ece of that puzzle does not know exactly what he is doi ng or where it will fit into the picture. When all of the pieces are put together, however, the finished grand design will be that of a one-world government maintained by forces against which resis tance by any nation will be futile. The Fearful Master is a book which is long overdue, but I prayerfully hope that it is not yet too late to awaken the American public. This book should be rea d by all Americans and demands their thoughtful and immediate attention. James B. Utt Member of Congress"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"FOREWORD On April 24, 1955, the Communist Daily Worker wrote: The United Nations has become an imposing instituti on with a fantastic pyramid of agencies and commissions, and an agenda each aut umn of 75 questons. . . . There it stands--in its striking home of stone and steel and glass on the shores of the East River to which thousands of people come ea ch week, in pilgrimages of peace and hope. This is one of those instances where the truth is s ufficiently horrible that the Communist propagandists do not have to lie. In the two decade s since the United Nations was created, it has expanded into a giant international bureaucracy wit h tentacles reaching into every sphere of human activity from matrimony to garbage collecting. Amer icans by the millions have indeed made the emotional pilgrimage and genuflected before the UN \"shrine of peace.\" But, having looked at the United Natttions, most of us have not seen. We have seen the building, and the flag, and pictures of meetings where delegates listen to each other over earphones; but we have not seen the real United Nations--its purpose, its philosophy, its ultimate goals. To recognize these things, we will have to l ook much deeper than the glittering phrases about peace and brotherhood or the ringing manifestos on human rights and let the facts speak for themselves . Wherever possible, quotations used in this book are from original sources. These sources have been thoroughly footnoted in hopes that the skeptic will check them out. Some may feel that there are too many quotes and footnotes. But this book was not me ant to be one of those easy-to-read jobs that can be glanced through with one eye on the TV set. It is a documentary and should be approached as such. Most of the documentation is taken from those peopl e or sources friendly to the United Nations. For instance, the opening sequence is a direct quote fr om Smith Hempstone, African correspondent for the Chicago News . Hempstone's views, in his own words, are as follo ws: I do not belong to the African Committee for Aid to Katan ga Freedom Fighters, I am not a member of the John Birch Society, am not i n the pay of the Katanga Government or Union Miniere , and really could not care less about the fluoridation of water. I am a registered Republican , although I did not vote Republican in the 1960 presidential election. I do believe th at the United Nations has a role to play in the world today-- and I believe that the U.S. should remain in the international organization. Likewise, the forty-six civilian doctors of Elisabe thville, who provided some of the most horrifying eyewitness accounts of United Nations atrocities, h ave declared: \". . . we believe in UNO [the United Nations]. . . . We proclaim that such an organizati on is necessary for maintaining peace in the world and fair betterment of the underdeveloped natons.\" While on the subject of Katanga, it should be made clear that the section of this book dealing with th e Congo is not meant to be a glorification of Katanga and Tshombe; it is meant to spotlight the United Nations action in Katanga. We are not being asked t o pay homage to Katanga nor are we being asked to transfer our political sovereignty, our ec onomy, and our military security to Katanga; we are being asked to do these things for the United Natio ns. It is for this reason that we need to take a close and searching look at this mammoth organizati on. And, just as one picture is worth a thousand words, one case history is worth a thousand theoret ical arguments. This is by no means an exhaustive treatment of the subject. If the reader wants a detailed explanation of the structure of the United Nations, how the organization functions mechanically, or what relation one subdivision has with another, he can find countless volumes in a public library. All of this is academic in the minds of most people, an yway. The citizens of Katanga who were dying"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"under United Naations bombs were not concerned over whether the air attacks had been authorized by the Security Council, the General Assembly or th e Military Staff Committee, or whether it took a two-thirds vote or only a majority vote. Nor has the tremendous financial burden that member ship in the United Naions places on the shoulders of American taxpayers been discussed. Aft er all, mere money is relatively unimportant. If the UN really were what most people think it is, it would be well wor th the investment. The real cost of our membership will not, in the end, be measured in terms of dollars and cents; it will be counted out in terms of lost freedoms, despair and human suffer ing. This is not an attempt to present an \"objective\" vi ew of the United Nations. If the reader wants to acquaint himself with the other side he need only t urn on his radio or TV, or glance through the pages of his favorite newspaper or magazine. The other si de has been presented almost without challenge by every conceivable means--books, movies, plays, s peeches, editorials, pamphlets, posters, and poetry. It has been promoted by politicians, athlet es, movie stars, teachers, beauty queens, and businessmen. By comparison, the case against the United Nations has been relegated almost entirely to the media of mimeographed news letters and hastily compiled fact sheets put out by housewives and neighborhood study groups. Radio and TV time is usually denied on the basis that such a point of view is \"controversial.\" It is as t hough history had slipped back 450 years. When Galileo attempted to demonstrate the theory that th e earth was not the center of the universe, he was imprisoned and condemned as follows: We say, pronounce, sentence and declare that you, the said Galileo, by reason of the matters adduced in this trial, and by you co nfessed as above, have rendered yourself, in the judgment of this holy off ice, vehemently suspected of heresy, namely of having believed and held the doct rine-- which is false and contrary to the sacred and divine scriptures-- that the sun is the center of the world and does not move from east to west, and that the earth moves and is not the center of the world. . . . Consequently, you ha ve incurred a ll the censures and penalties imposed and promulgated in the sacred s canons and other constitutions, general and particular, against such delinquents.

Telegram to U Thant from the forty- six civilian doctors of Elisabethville, the Congo CHAPTER ONE: THE FIRST SPADE It was December 12, 1961. Christmas was coming to K atanga. Smith Hempstone, African correspondent for the Chic ago News, reported from Elisabethville: The Unite d Nations jets next turned their attention to the c enter of the city. Screaming in at treetop level while excited soldier s and white civilians popped away at them with anything from 22 pistols to subma chine guns, they blasted the post office and radio stat ion, severing Katanga's communications with the outside world . . .. One came to the conclusion tha t the United Nations' action was intended to make it more difficult for correspo ndents to let the world know what was going on in Katanga, since the only way press dispatches could be filed was to drive them 150 miles to Northern Rhode sia over a road studded with tribal roadblocks and subject to United Nations air attacks . . .. By December 12, 1961 . . . mortar shells hailed down on the center of the city as the softening up process began . . .. Among the \"military objectives \" hit: a beauty shop, the apartment of the French consul, Sabena Airways offi ce, the Roman Catholic Cathedral, the Elisabethville museum. A car pulled up in front of the Grand Hotel Leopol d II where all of us were staying. \"Look at the work of the American criminal s,\" sobbed the Belgian driver. \"Take a picture and send it to Kennedy!\" In the bac k seat, his eyes glazed with shock, sat a wounded African man cradling in his ar ms the body of hi s ten year old son. The child's face and belly had been smashe d to jelly by mortar fragments. 1 The forty-six civilian doctors of Elisabethville un animously issued a joint report on the United Natio ns actions against Katanga which included the followin g account of the December 12, 1961, bombing of the Shinkolobwe hospital: The Shinkolobwe h ospital is visibly marked with an enormous red cros s on the roof of the administrative pavilion. . . . At about 8 a.m. . . . two aeroplanes flew over the hospital twice at very low altitude; at about 9:30 a.m. the aeroplanes started machine-gunning . . . t he market square, and then the school and the hospital in which there were about 300 patients and their families. . . . The administrative building, the left wing of the f our pavilions and the household buildings . . . were bombed and show hundreds of po in ts of impact made by the machine-gun bullets. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"In the maternity, roof, ceilings, walls, beds, tabl es and chairs are riddled with bullets; a bomb exploded in another pavilion which was luckily unoccupied; the roof, the ceiling, half of the walls and the furn iture have been blasted and shattered. . . . The blood from the wounded makes t he buildings look like a battlefield. . . . In the maternity, four Katangan women who had just been delivered and one newborn child are wounded, a visiting child of four years o ld is killed; two men and one child are killed. . . . Out of the 300 patients, 240 fled into the bush, re fusing to be evacuated to any other hospital, for they say . . . \"the UNO prefers to aim at the hospitals and we would henceforth no longer feel safe t here.\" 2 Professor Ernest van den Haag 3 made a personal visit to the Congo to witness firs thand the events and conditions there. In commenting on the United N ations statement that the only civilians wounded in Katanga were combatants in the resistance, he sa id: It is hard to speak, as I did, with a mother whose husband was killed at home in her presence with bayonets by UN soldiers. 4 She was in the hospital to help take care of her six year old child, severely wounded by United Nations bayonets. A child's bayonet wou nds are hardly due to having been suspected of bein g mercenary or combatant. 5 The doctors of Elisabethville reported the \"triple and particularly heinous assassination of three elderly people\" on December 16, 1961, as follows: The . . . \"boy\" of Mr. Derriks, Mr. André Kapenga, a witness, relates that nothing special occurred until 1:45 p.m . At this moment, the old cook, Mr. Jean Fimbo, has just brought coffee into the drawing room, and Mr. Guillaume Derriks (60- year- old Belgian) and his elderly mother (aged 87) who l ives with him, are about to drink it. At that moment, an armored car of the UNO takes up position on the path . . . and is machine- gunning the other side of the valley. . . . When th e firing has ceased, [United Nations] mercenaries enter the gard en . . . and machine- gun the two cars parked in the garage. The \"boy\" André Kapenga, is panic-stricken; he lock s himself in the food- store next to the kitchen. The [soldiers] climb the stair s leading from the garage to the kitchen and with a burst of machine- gun fire shoot Mr. Jean Fimbo, who has sought refuge under the sink . . . enter the drawin g- room where Mr. Derriks who cries out in English: \"Not me,\" is shot down by a b ullet . . . and is finished off by a burst which blows off half of his face and skull. A few seconds later, a third burst hits Mrs. Derrik s in the right breast . . . an d in the neck. . . . At about 5 p.m. the \"boy\" Kapenga hears the soldier s once more entering the villa, where they run about looting to a slight ext ent before leaving. Soon after, Mr. Kapenga ventures out of his hiding place and ho rrified at the sight of t he three bodies, runs away and hides himself in a loft . 6 Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs G. Mennen Williams, speaking in Detroit, accused the Katangese government of fabricating what he called \"horrendous tales of indiscriminate mayhem by United Nations troops\" during their December attack on Katanga. Millions of Americans read"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Williams' assurances in their newspapers and were r elieved. Practically no one has read Smith Hempstone's reply: Unquestionably, the Katanga Information Service had played up United Nations atrocities, real and imagined, for all they were wo rth. Will iams might have been in a better position to judge, however, had he spent s ome time in Elisabethville's Leo Deux while UN mortar shells rained down during those last days before Christmas. Every newsman there had seen civilians s helled with his own eyes. E ach of us had seen Red Cross vehicles destroyed by United Nations fire. Or were all of us lying? Georges Alavet, the Swedish R ed Cross representative, lay in his shallow grave in testimony that we were not. Sanché de Gramont of the New York Herald Tribune might well have sent Williams a few pieces of the shrapnel picked from his body after United Nations troops shot up the civilian car in which he was leaving Elisabethville. 7 Much has happened since December 12, 1961. Like any point along the infinite corridor of time, it is neither the beginning nor the end. But it is a refe rence point, a handhold on an otherwise glass- smooth sphere too large to grasp in its entirety. T he story of Katanga, its tragic struggle for freedo m against the United Nations and the part that this s tory plays in the overall view of the United Nation s itself, is so vast, so huge and overpowering that i t seems impossible to find a place to begin. But, l ike most seemingly overwhelming tasks, it is not as imp ortant where one begins as it is that one does begin. To move a mountain, one must dig. December 1 2, 1961, is the first spade. NOTES 1.

Vleurinck, 96 Avenue de Broqueville, Bruxelles 15, 1962. The majority of the forty-six civilian doctor s are Belgian, but they also include Swiss, Hungarian , Brazilian, and Spanish. They practice medicine in the Congo, not for profit, but for the benefit o f the underdeveloped populations. The political questions did not concern them. Being doctors, they had no position to take regarding matters which they felt were solely the responsibility of the Kat angese government and UN authorities. What was their concern, however, was the health and well-bei ng of the population in their care. The prevention of wounds was of equal concern to them as the preve ntion of sickness. Consequently, they were well within their role of physicians when they issued th eir protest and declared: \"It is not as active partisans of an independent Katanga that the civili an doctors of Elisabethville have thought it their duty to warn the world conscience, but strictly as citizens of the world, besides being bound by the Hippocratic oath which compels them to fight agains t death wherever it may come from.\" 3.

Senator Thomas Dodd, November 1962 CHAPTER TWO: PROLOGUE TO TRAGEDY To fully understand this Christmas tragedy in Katan ga, one must be familiar with at least a few events and personalities that were the principal parts of the prologue. It is not necessary to go into the ri ch and interesting history of Africa itself over the p ast two or three centuries, although such an exerci se would undoubtedly be intellectually rewarding. Nor is it necessary to catalog the vast and varied mineral wealth of Africa and particularly of Katang a. Let it suffice to say here that such wealth is considerable. It is undoubtedly one of the factors which has caused behind-the-scenes manipulators from both East and West to bring their full influen ce to bear on the international \"front men\" who hav e seemingly shaped the events in Katanga. 1 In fact, we need only go back a few years in time a nd concentrate our attention on a rather small number of actors in this tragic play. We can safely ignore the cast of millions and the supporting rol es of hundreds of walk-ons and bit players who have pa raded across the stage. Most of these either have been written into the play to dazzle the criti cs or else they were never really part of the play at all--just a collection of stagehands and stand-ins who were accidentally caught in the shifting spotlight. Let us set the stage. The date is now June 30, 1960 . For many months radio stations in Red China, Communist Czechoslovakia and Romania have been beam ing inflammatory propaganda broadcasts into Africa, attempting to agitate the populations into active support for the traditional Soviet prog ram of anticolonialism. 2 As defined by the Communists, this slogan means to break away all colonial holdings from non-Communist countries like Belgium, Portugal, France, and England. The Communists, of course, are not acting out of humani tarian instincts when they do this. Their purpose is twofold. First, they know that breaking away the se colonial holdings will unavoidably weaken the non-Communist countries that have them and depend o n them for much of their economic viability and, to some extent, for their military national se curity. The second reason is that a newly-emergent government with its inexperienced leadership is rel atively easy to infiltrate and subvert to the cause of international Communism. So, in one fell swoop the Communists' program of anti-colonialism not only weakens their enemies but also provides them with g olden opportunities to capture still more of the earth's terrain and population. Needless to say, th e Communists are not interested in discussing the granting of independence to their own colonial hold ings, the captive nations behind the iron curtain. 3 Be that as it may, by mid-1960 the worldwide Commun ist drive of \"anti-colonialism\" had reached an all-time high. The Communist press in America was r epeatedly instructing its readers to whip up mass popular support for the cause. All those who q uestioned the wisdom of this trend were branded \"imperialists\" and their comments were buried in an avalanche of emotionalism. \"Exploitation,\" \"cruel and inhuman treatment of the natives,\" and \"humanit arian consideration\" were phrases shouted at anyone who doubted the wisdom of granting immediate independence to colonial areas. The great advances that had been made, the miraculous transpl anting of civilization into regions totally primiti ve and savage, the progress that had been made in the cultural and educational levels of natives even in the bush country--these and many other considera tions were rarely mentioned. Apparently they were not thought to be as good a vehicle for sellin g newspapers or gaining acclaim at the lecturn as the more sensational stories of exploitation and pr ofiteering. In keeping with the prevailing mood, Communist and Afro-Asian delegates at the United Nations had initiated a series of resolutions calling for the i mmediate independence of the Belgian Congo. The United States also went on record in favor of this position and exerted no small amount of pressure on the Belgian government to comply. Finally, after a few sporadic anti-colonial demonstrations in the"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Congo, Belgium yielded to international pressure . 4 On June 30, 1960, the Congo was granted independence. The first character of importance to appear on-stag e is one Patrice Lumumba. What kind of a man was he? What were his motives? His objectives? Thes e questions can be answered succinctly. He was a deranged and degenerate dope addict; he was a willing agent of the Communists; he worked tirelessly to bring chaos, anarchy and bloodshed to the Congo as the necessary first stage toward his ultimate goal of complete and unlimited dictatorshi p with himself nominally at the top and with Communist power to back him up. This may come as quite a shock to many who remember the glowing praises sung for this man a few years ago in the highest echelons of our Government and in our communications media. But for the skeptic who still can't quite bring himself to beli eve that government officials and news editors ever could be mistaken, let the record speak for itself. It was well known that for at least two years the S oviets had been supplying Lumumba with arms, ammunition, military vehicles and other necessary s upplies to insure an appropriate spontaneous\" uprising of the people against their \"colonial-impe rialist masters.\" In addition to the hardware, they provided $400,000 a month with which to buy followe rs and provide them with the little extras that insure loyalty, such as cars, extravagant parties, and women. Lumumba's Communist backing was widely acknowledged and had been described in detai l in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. 5 Writing in the Brooklyn Tablet on April 15, 1961, Bishop Fulton J. Sheen said: Lumumba set up a Communist organization among his f ellow tribesmen, the Batetelas, making them believe that he was the inca rnation of his ancestor s. During the elections, Lumumba's troops destroyed mo st of the ballot boxes of the other candidates . . .. The plans for the Communist revolution in the Congo were prepared in Prague, and in the first three months, Lumumba carried out the first three poin ts of the plan: to organize mutiny in the army; put the blame on the Belgians; organize a terrorist regime. 6 Although few Americans knew it at the time (or know it even now) evidence of Communist support for Lumumba was so plentiful and undeniable that Secret ary-General Dag Hammarskjold felt obliged to reassure the non-Communist world that Soviet aid to Lumumba was actually in support of United Nations policy, and therefore presumably quite all right. 7 Even Conor Cruise O'Brien, chief United Nations representative in Katanga, admitted that th e Soviets had given Lumumba 100 trucks, 29 transport planes and 200 technicians. 8 These figures, of course, were an underestimation. For one thing, they did not include the more than two hundr ed Russian and Czechoslovakian \"diplomats\" who were by then swarming all over the Congo. 9 And finally, as revealed later by Colonel Joseph M obutu, who had been serving under Lumumba, Red China had p romised Lumumba $2,800,000 in aid. 10 Lumumba had written: \"if necessary, I shall not hes itate to call in the DEVIL 11 to save the country. . . . I am convinced that with the unreserved support of the Soviets, I shall win the day in spite of everything!\" 12 Joseph Yav, a former Lumumba associate and economic s minister of his government until July 17, 1960, made the following statement to Philippa Schu yler, an American reporter in the Congo at the time of independence: Yes, Lumumba is a Communist! I know it. I have proof. This does no t mean Lumumba understands the ideological theories of Com munism or its intellectual background. He's never read Das Kapital. He went Red not for mental convictions but be cause he was bought. On his visit to Russia and Eas t Germany, he was given money, presents, girls and la vish hospitality. He never "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"looked behind the glitter to see the real foundatio n of these slave states. 13 This, of course, is the general pattern of recruitm ent into the Communist party in those parts of the world where there is not a sufficient group of so-c alled \"intellectuals\" from which to draw. The Communists much prefer the intellectual type since they are more easily ensnared and it is less expensive to keep them hooked on the party line. Bu t in Africa they have to use money and flattery to accomplish what intellectual deception and flattery will accomplish for them in the more \"advanced\" countries. This point was graphically brought home by Gabriel Kitenge, national president of the Congolese Union party, when he told the same report er: The Communists have bribed scores of Congo politica l leaders- with trips, girls, gifts, cars and flattery. The Congolese never rose above lower-middle- class living under the Belgians. So they are hungry for luxuries. They will do anyth ing for luxuries. Ideologies and principles are vague and far off to them; it's the eloquent message of material things that they listen to. . . . I have tried to tell American consular officials he re of the grave danger that the Congo will go Red after independence, but they don' t listen to me. I beg of you, tell your newspaper readers in Americ a of the grave Communist menace that threatens here. Beg them to pressure th eir congressmen in Washington to do something about it! Don't let the West abandon us! 14 If further evidence is needed of the bond between L umumba and his Communist masters, one need only note that Khrushchev changed the name of the P eoples Friendship University near Moscow to the Patrice Lumumba Friendship University in honor of this \"great African leader.\" 15 The Arabs were the first to introduce hashish culti vation to the Congo. It has since become one of the chief vices throughout the entire region. Lumumba w as well acquainted with the custom. Stewart Alsop of the Saturday Evening Post summed it up when he said: \"The notion that Lumumba was worshipped by Congolese masses was a myth. Lumumba was an accomplished demagogue, when he found the time between bouts of gin-drinking and hashish-smoking. . . . He was also roundly hated for many reasons, most of them good.\" 16 Lumumba's character and Communist loyalties will be revealed even further as the Congo tragedy unfolds. But this is a fairly accurate description of the man for whom Washington rolled out the red carpet. Moise Tshombe was the second protagonist on our sta ge to receive world attention, though not the same type Lumumba received. To start off with, Tsho mbe was an anti-Communist--a handicap he never quite overcame in the American press. He was almost universally depicted as \"shrewd,\" \"a Belgian puppet,\" \"opportunistic,\" and the usual jou rnalistic innuendoes carefully designed to turn public opinion against a person about whom nothing specifically bad can be found. The truth of the matter is that Tshombe is the son of a successful A frican merchant, has earned a college degree, is a devout Christian, and had the overwhelming support and respect of the people who elected him to the presidency of Katanga. Not only is he a staunch anti-Communist, he is an ardent advocate of the concepts of limited government and the free enterpr ise system. He is a student of history and a great admirer of the success of the American experiment. He fully understands the wisdom of the traditional American political system of checks and balances with a further division of power between the Federal Government and the states. Explaining h is views, he said: \"We would like something rather on the American model. We are willing to hav e a federal president and to give the central government control of the army, the customs and tha t sort of thing.\" 17 "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Even after the United Nations had initiated a blood y war against Katanga to force it to abandon this position, Tshombe held firm. Returning to Katanga a fter the December United Nations attack, he said, \"Katanga must be unified with its brothers in the Congo but remain sufficiently free so that its fate will not be sealed on the day the shadow of Co mmunism spreads over this country.\" 18 With this background in mind, it is not hard to see why Tshombe was anathema to the Communists. Khrushchev ranted, \"Tshombe is a turncoat, a traito r to the interests of the Congolese people.\" 19 It is interesting to note that Tshombe was also anathema to U.S. officials. While wining and dining almost every Communist dictator on the face of the earth f rom Khrushchev to Tito to Castro to Lumumba, our State Department flatly refused to grant a visa for Tshombe to enter the United States. 20 Plans for complete chaos in the Congo had been well laid. Many uneducated Africans were told that just as soon as independence came they would automa tically own all the property of the white settlers--and the settlers too! One of the campaign promises made by Lumumba was that the Congolese could have all of the European women they wanted after independence. 21 It did not take very long. A few days after indepen dence, the Congolese army mutinied against its Belgian officers. Lumumba reacted immediately by di scharging the officers and expelling them from the country. He promoted every one of the mutinous soldiers at least one rank and moved up several to the level of general. All men received a substan tial pay raise. The lowest paid soldier was getting about twice that of an American GI of equivalent ra nk. Devoid of professional military command and whipped up by Lumumba and his followers, the Congol ese army went on a spree of plunder, murder and rape. European residents fled in terror by the thousands leaving behind their homes, their possessions, their businesses, and everything they had worked for. Currency was frozen and most of them left with only a hastily packed suitcase. Few Americans understood what was going on. Their n ews sources did not help them much. All attention was focused on the pictures of crying wom en being helped off planes and the sensational accounts of widespread rape. We were not given any insight into why this chaos had happened or who had triggered it. It was made to appear as some thing that just happened. Editors by the droves speculated, \"Well what can you expect? After all th ose years of exploiting the natives, the Belgians are just reaping the harvest that they themselves h ave sown.\" Newswoman Philippa Schuyler shed a little light on how it \"just happened\" when she reported: They had been maliciousl y egged on to start the disorder. In the wee hours of July 9, someone rushed into the barracks shouting, \"Come and fight! The whites are about to attack you! You're about to be killed! \" No one was attacking the soldiers. It was a deliber ate lie, with frigh tful consequences.\" 22 The Reverend Mark Poole of the Luluabourg Presbyter ian Mission and other missionaries in the Congo confirmed that the outbreaks of violence were undoubtedly Communist inspired and that they were too widespread and well coordinated to have ju st happened by cbance. 23 As soon as word of the chaos reached Brussels, Belg ium ordered its troops back to the Congo to protect the lives and property of its citizens ther e. In a fit of rage Lumumba officially declared war on Belgium and called on the United Nations for milita ry help against Belgian intervention. The United Nations complied, as we shall see. At the outset, h owever, Belgium called on its NATO friend, the United States, for help so that it could not be acc used of trying to perpetuate its influence in its f ormer possession. Washington refused, saving it would rat her act through the United Nations. Khrushchev lashed out against the Belgians, calling them \"crim inal aggressors.\" The very same day, July 14, 1960, the United States delegation at the United Na tions sided with the Soviets in a resolution stoutl y condemning Belgium, demanding immediate withdrawal of her troops, and authorizing the United Nations to send troops of its own to assist Lumumba . 24 Within four days, the first four thousand"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"United Nations troops were flown into the Congo by U.S. Air Force planes. Many additional thousands were on the way. By July 23 most of the B elgian troops had withdrawn. The territory was now in the hands of Lumumba's mutinous army and the United Nations \"peace-keeping\" forces. The plunder and rape continued and spread. Smith He mpstone reported: Not only was the United Nations singularly ineffect ive in reestablishing order in these regions but it did little to assist in the ev acuation of terrified white wome n and children from these provinces. The United Natio ns had planes available to evacuate to Stanleyville Gizengists [supporters of the Communist Antoine Gizenga] who felt themselves in danger in areas und er the control of the Leopoldville Government. But i t showed little interest in evacuating whites from Stanleyville. . . . If a Lumumbist was maltreated, a general outcry could be expected from the Communist bloc, the Afro- Asian nations, and from liberal circles in Britain and America. If a white woman wa s killed or molested. . .it made little difference. 25 Newswoman Schuyler reported: . . . a uniformed rabble was ruling Stanleyville-- there was continual extortion, brawling, beating and arbitrary arrests. Portuguese and Greeks had to pay as much as $60 to drunken soldiers to avoid arrest. Pa ssengers arriving at Stanleyville's airport were me t with a bayonet in the stomach, while Congolese loafers would scream, \"We are the masters!\" Congole se seized European cars right and left while UN Colonel Yohanna Chites said he could not intervene. 26 The following account appeared in the New York Daily News under the heading \"Congo Rebels Attack UN Train, Slay Kids\": Hundreds of rebel Ba luba tribesmen yesterday massacred at least 20 Afri cans in three attacks on a UN guarded train taking school c hildren home for a New Year's vacation. . . . Scores of others were injure d and many passengers kidnapped by rebels after the attacks in Southern Katanga. . . . The train left Elisabethville . . . with some 300 passengers, incl uding 100 children, and a strong guard of UN troops. But, when it reached Kam ina . . . in western Katanga, only 40 people were aboard. . . . At Luena, three p assengers were ki lled, many were kidnapped and the station was pillaged. Severa l African women passengers . . . were raped. At Bukama, waves of tr ibesmen attacked the train again with spears, clubs, rifles, bows and arrows a nd machetes, killing 17 passengers and kidnapping many more. A spokesman said that the 17 persons who died at Bukama \"were killed under the eyes of t he UN.\" Roger Nonkel, the assistant high commissioner of Sa nkuru in Kasai province, stated: The UN are unable to restore order, and what is mor e, they are not even trying. In August, I asked help for Lusambo from Colonel La smar [chief of UN troops in Kasai]. . . . I told him that with fifty UN soldier s I could prevent war between the Batetela [Lumumba's tribe] . . . and the Baluba. He answered me coldly: \"Let them kill themselves.\" 27 The Communist plan for taking over the Congo was pr ogressing as planned. Step one: Capture control of the leadership at the top. Step two: Bri ng about utter and complete chaos to justify the harsh police-state measures which must be used to e stablish firm dictatorial rule. Step three: Put the blame on non-Communists. Step four: Maneuver as man y non-Communists as possible into actually"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"doing the dirty work for them. Now came the visible beginnings of step number five, the police-state measures themselves. On August 2, 1960, the Congolese central government decreed that any Belgian business which had been abandoned during the mayhem would be confiscat ed by the state unless reclaimed within eight days. The Congo's largest and most influential newspaper Le Courier d'Afrique was seized by the government, forced to shut down, and its editor was thrown in jail for printing critical remarks about Lumumba. The editor was finally expelled to Belgium and the paper resumed operation with a more \"acceptable\" editorial policy. 28 Lumumba moved swiftly to consolidate his totalitari an control. On September 15 he issued the following lengthy and highly revealing directive to the heads of the various provinces throughout the Congo: SUBJECT: Measures To Be Applied During the First St ages of the Dictatorship. Sir, I have the honour and the pleasure to inform you th at with a view to the rapid restoration of order in the co untry, the House of Representatives and the Senate [of the central government], meeting in special ses sion on 13 September of this year, decided to grant the government full powers. Full powers should be understood to mean that the government is free to ac t as it thinks fit in all respects, for the purpose of s uppressing abuses, disorders and any action which is contrary to the will of the gov ernment over which I have presided legally since the attainment of independen ce by the Congo. . . . The most effecti ve and direct means of succeeding rapidly in our ta sk may be summarized as follows: 1. Establish an absolute dictatorship and apply it in all its forms. 2. Terrorism, essential to subdue the population. 3. Proceed systematically, using the army, to arres t all members of the opposition . I will be personally responsible for those at Leo poldville including the Head of State and his close supporters. A few weeks ago, in view of the present situation in Katanga and Sud-Kasai, I sent the Nati onal Army to arrest T shombe and Kalonji and even to kill them if possible. . . . 4. Imprison the ministers, deputies and senators, w ho sometimes abuse their parliamentary immunity. In such a case I should be glad if you would not spare them but arrest them all without pity and treat them with ten times more severity than ordinary individuals. 5. Revive the system of flogging and give the rebels 10 lashes, morning and evening, for a maximum of 7 consecutive days. N.B. Double the number in the case of ministers, se nators, and dep uties, reducing the number gradually according to the cond ition of each individual. 6. Inflict profound humiliations on the people thus arrested, in addition to the obligatory treatment described above. For example , strip them in public, if "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"possible in the presence of their wives and children. Make them ca rry heavy loads and force them to walk about in that state. I n case of such a walk, however, drawers may be worn. 7. In view of the seriousness of the situation of t he country, which is in danger of sinkin g into anarchy, it would be well to imprison repeat ed offenders in underground cells or prisons for at least six month s, never allowing them out to breathe fresh air. N.B. If some of them succumb as a result of certain atrocities, which is possible and des irable, the truth should not be divulged but it sho uld be announced, for instance, that Mr. X has escaped and cannot be foun d. 8. Those who do not succumb in prison should not be released for at least a year. In this case they shall be exiled to a countr y to be determined by me in agreement with certain foreign countries which have already signified their agreement in principle. Some of the provincial presidents will say that the measures described are severe. In reply I would point out to them that cer tain politicians have attained power by means of dictatorship. Moreover, the measu res of execution that I have indicated above constitute only the first stage of the basic regime that we hope will succeed in the Congo. The second stage will be to destroy anyon e who criticizes us. . . . In conclusion, I would point out that this letter s hould be communicated only to those authorities under your orders in whom you hav e entire confidence. (signed) P. LUMUMBA Prime Minister 29 A few months later, Lumumba issued a follow-up memo randum which said: \"Get to work immediately and have courage. Long live the Soviet Union! Long live Khrushchev!\" 30 When Lumumba came to the United States he was royal ty received on behalf of the American people by President Eisenhower who even had him stay in th e official presidential guest house. He conferred with Henry Cabot Lodge, Dag Hammarskjold and Christ ian Herter, then our secretary of state. 31 And a few weeks later, Eisenhower announced that be had sent the first five million of an expected 100 million dollars to Lumumba to help the Congo meet i ts most pressing needs. 32 NOTES 1.

Kwame Nkrumah, president of Ghana, 1960 Letter to Kwame Nkrumah Thank you very much for your letter of July 27th expressing your thanks for the assistance which m y Government has been able to provide . . . . I agree with you that the United Nations' action in t he Congo is a most heartening demonstration of the eff ectiveness with which the world community can cooperate. President Eisenhower, 1960 CHAPTER THREE: SECEDING FROM CHAOS \"I am seceding from chaos!\" With these words, Moise Tshombe declared that his p rovince of Katanga wanted no further part of the Communist-dominated central government. He requ ested Belgium to return her troops to the province, to subdue the mutinous Congolese army, an d to restore civil order. This they did with little difficulty. Tshombe appointed a Belgian major to re organize the army and reestablish military discipline. With experienced European officers pred ominantly in charge, a whole new army was recruited. Of the original 2,800 mutinous soldiers, only 300 were allowed to remain. 1 Within a few days, life had returned to normal thro ughout most of Katanga. Businesses resumed operation and civilians once again walked the stree ts with no fear of wanton violence. As one eyewitness observer described it: \"Elisabethville, a bastion of anti-Communism in a sea of Congo leftist terror, was calm and functioning smoothly i n late August.\" 2 As early as July 21, 1960, Patrick O'Donovan reported in the New York Herald Tribune: \"There is good order in Elisabethville. The streets are patrolled by black and white soldiers t ogether. . . . There is almost no local opposition to Tshombe's plans.\" One of the very first acts of the newly independent nation was to discharge all of the Red professors at Elisabethville University who had been attemptin g to indoctrinate and recruit students on behalf of international Communism. Posters began to appear on the streets: \"Katanga, Africa's shield against Communism.\" And Godefroi Munongo, the interior mini ster, reflected the views of the government when he stated: \"I want my country, Katanga, to be a bastion of anti-Communism in Africa. I detest Communism and will not alter my opposition to it. K atanga will stay independent, no matter what. We shall not give in.\" 3 To the leaders of Katanga, independence did not mea n that they were unwilling to cooperate with other provinces, to enter into a specifically limit ed political union with them, or even to share the rather substantial tax revenues obtained from the e xtensive mining operations within their territory. As mentioned earlier, Tshombe wanted a federal union a nd local autonomy somewhat similar to that in America. Commenting on his vision for the future, Tshombe ex plained: Katanga is nea rly as large as France. Our people have a different history, traditions, and outlook from those of the Congo. Every people has the right to its own self-determination. There is no reason why we should be exploited by the "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Congo. Because we were in the past is no reason why we should be in the future. 4 [Italics added.] This attitude was even written into the newly estab lished constitution. Article I read: \"The State of Katanga adheres to the principle of the association with the other regions of the former Belgian Congo, provided they themselves are politically organized with respect to law and order. \" 5 As we have already seen, however, the central government had other plans--and so did the United Nations. As to what those intentions were, one cannot readil y find them in the high-sounding phrases and self- righteous platitudes of official United Nations pro clamations. They are there, but one has to be experienced in the highly complex art of reading bu reaucratese. While most human beings communicate with each other to convey ideas, politicians are prone to use language as a m eans of concealing ideas. An example of this planned deception is the blatant contradiction between the United Nations public pronouncements regarding Kata nga and its actual performance. On July 14, 1960 (the same day that the Security Co uncil passed the first resolution condemning Belgium and authorizing the use of United Nations t roops in the Congo), and again on July 20, Dag Hammarskjold stated the UN's position: 1. The United Nations force could not intervene in the internal affairs of the Congo. 2. It would not be used to settle the Congo's const itutional issue. 3. It would not be used to end Katanga's secession. 6 In July, Ralph Bunche (as special United Nations re presentative for Hammarskjold) told Tshombe that the United Nations force \"has received strict instructions not to intervene in the internal polit ics of the country.\" 7 On August 9 the Security Council passed another re solution which \"reaffirms that the UN Congo force will not be a party to, or in any wa y intervene in, or be used to influence the outcome of, any internal conflict, constitutional or otherw ise.\" 8 In speaking specifically about Katanga's secession, Dag Hammarskjold said: This is an internal political problem to which the UN as an organization obviously cannot be a party. Nor would the entry of the UN fo rce in Katanga mean any taking of sides in the conflict to which I have jus t referred. Nor should it b e permitted to shift the weight between personalities or groups or schools of thought in a way which would prejudice the solution of the internal political problem. 9 Nothing could have been plainer than that. Yet imme diately United Nations troops began to move into position for entry into Katanga. Tshombe was leery of the whole operation and protested to Hammarskjold that since everything was calm and pea ceful in his province, there was no need for United Nations \"peacekeeping\" forces. On August 12 Hammarskjold personally conveyed his a ssurances to Tshombe that the United Nations would \"not he used on behalf of the central government to force the provisional government of Mr. Tshombe to a specific line of action.\" 10 With these solemn pledges and under Hammarskjold’s insistence, Tshombe had no alternative short of arm ed resistance but to allow UN troops access to Katanga. They came by the thousands. "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"As mentioned earlier, Katanga was at peace. There w ere other places throughout the Congo that were in far greater need of UN forces than Katanga. Kasai province was in the throes of civil war and the countryside was literally red with blood, but t he UN sent troops to Katanga. Stanleyville was a nightmare of lawlessness and violence, but the UN s ent troops to Katanga. Away from the metropolitan areas the practice of cannibalism was being revived and missionaries were being slaughtered by the score, but the UN sent troops to Katanga. By September 1961 between twelve thousand and fourteen thousand troops, by far the g reater portion of the entire United Nations force, had been concentrated inside peaceful Katanga. 11 Why were they there? Only a fool could believe that their purpose was anything other than to end K atanga's secession and to bring it back under the central government. Tshombe was no fool. In spite of the grim implicati ons of the arrival of UN military might, he somehow managed to keep his composure and even his sense of humor. The first United Nations troops to arrive at Elisabethville's airport on August 12 wer e supposedly Dag Hammarskjold’s personal bodyguard. When they landed Tshombe greeted them an d the accompanying dignitaries by handing them each tourist brochures entitled -'Elisabethvil le Welcomes You.\" 12 Then, before anyone could object, the honor guard led by Belgian officers pre sented the Katangese colors while a band played the newly written Katangese national anthem. What a picture that must have been--United Nations soldiers, officers and dignitaries standing rigidly at attention before a fluttering flag symbolizing the very sovereignty which they bad been sent to destro y. At this point in the drama it becomes necessary to introduce a third character--Conor Cruise O'Brien. Mr. O'Brien was formerly an Irish delegate to the G eneral Assembly of the UN before being requested by Dag Hammarskjold to join his executive staff in the Secretariat as special advisor on African affairs. From here he was assigned to the C ongo where he personally directed the United Nations political operation in Katanga. When it was discovered that he had imported his Irish girl friend to Katanga, and when she found herself unexp ectedly in the news as part of an international incident, O'Brien was recalled to New York and allo wed to resign. There were other good reasons for getting rid of O'Brien, too. For one thing, he was too outspoken and it soon became obvious that he had to be removed. He was not the first underling i n the UN to he thrown to the wolves in order to save the reputation of a higher official. Fortunately, however, O'Brien decided to write a bo ok about the Katanga affair. It is a treasure of li ttle glimpses into the innermost workings of the mind of an \"international servant.\" He was and is a fierce advocate of the United Nations. He clings to all of the intellectual fallacies about the United Nation s which will be the subject of a later chapter. Even though he had personally participated in and helped to execute one of the most perfidious schemes ever directed against freedom-loving human beings, he apparently did not realize what he had done, or so he says. The important point, however, is that O'Brien speak s with authority. He was there. Obviously, a great deal of what he has to say must be taken with a lar ge grain of salt. But what he reveals about both himself and the organization to which he is so stro ngly committed is, if anything, overly charitable. If O'Brien's words are incriminating in spite of his p ro-United Nations bias, then they are certainly worthy of our serious consideration. For example, consider O'Brien's description of a me eting of the \"Congo club,\" which is the nickname for his group of top United Nations planners and ad visors on the Congo. Among others, Dag Hammarskjold and Ralph Bunche (representing the U.S .) were present. The Afro-Asian thesis-- that the secession of Katanga would have to be ende d, and that the United Nations would have to help acti vely in ending it-- was tacitly accepted round the table, and not less by the Ameri cans than by the others. What mattered most to all of them was that the Unit ed Nations should emerge successfully from its Congo ordeal, and it was clea rly seen th at a condition of success was the speedy removal of the props of Mr. Tshombe's regime, thereby making possible the restoration of the unity of the Congo. The continued "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"existence of the independent state of Katanga was r ecognized as a threat to the existenc e of the United Nations and therefore even those wh o, from the standpoint of their personal political opinions, mi ght have been favourably enough disposed to what Mr. Tshombe represented, we re convinced of the necessity of strong measures. . . . This was a n example of the victory of an international loyalty over personal predilections. If neutral men are simply men who put the interests of the United Nations first, then Hammarskjold and all around him at that table were neutral men. 13 Ignoring for the moment the enlightening definition of UN neutrality, one should really go back and reread this incredible statement several times to f ully comprehend the extent of the calm premeditation behind the policy of deliberate decep tion initiated by these high officials. For months they had been issuing public statements and persona l assurances that the United Nations not only had no intentions of interfering in the internal ma tter of Katanga's secession, but that it had no leg al right to do so under the terms of its own Charter. Yet, at the very outset O'Brien, Hammarskjold, Bunche and a host of other top United Nations plann ers sat around a conference table and quietly worked out plans for removing \"the props of Mr. Tsh ombe's regime.\" Elsewhere in his book O'Brien provided more illumin ation on the United Nations' total lack of integrit y and respect for honesty in its pretended aims when he wrote that Mr. M. Khiary (head of UN civil operations in the Congo) . . . had little patience with legalistic detail, w ith paragraph this of resolution that, or what the Secretary-General had said in August 19 60. He h ad no patience at all with the theory, often asserted in the early da ys by Hammarskjold, and never explicitly abandoned, that the United Nations must refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of the Congo. \"What are we here fo r then?\" he would ask. \"Il faut faire de la politique!\" And on the word politique his brown eyes, usually so disconcertingly blank, would flash. He and Mr. Gardiner [another UN official] did \"make politics,\" throwing all semblance of non-intervention to the winds. . . . 14 While the United Nations was pouring troops into Ka tanga, things were going from bad to horrible elsewhere in the Congo. On August 4, when Lumumba r eturned in a Russian plane from his grand tour of Belgium, the United States and England, he found unexpected opposition awaiting. Many of his former associates had decided they no longer wa nted to be identified with either him or his politics. On August 10 Lumumba was seized and stone d by an angry mob in Leopoldville and barely escaped with his life. On August 25 more anti-Lumum ba demonstrations and riots broke out all over the city. 15 Meanwhile, a small group of former British army off icers from Rhodesia had entered Kasai province and formed a volunteer corps of leaders to train Ba luba tribesmen for battle against Lumumba's men. They explained that they were sick of the West doin g nothing to effectively fight the Congo's Reds. 16 On September 5 Kasavubu, president of the central g overnment and a rather weak-kneed politician (but not a Communist), dismissed Prime Minister Lumumba. Lu mumba refused to acknowledge the action and promptly dismissed Kasavubu. At this poi nt the lower house and the senate both convened illegally without a quorum. The house inva lidated both dismissals. The senate declared its confidence in Lumumba. Complete confusion and anarc hy reigned supreme. Finally, on September 14 a young army colonel by th e name of Joseph Mobutu, using what military power be could muster, picked up the pieces and sei zed control of the government. Kasavubu threw his support behind him and they appointed a committ ee of college graduates to run things"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"temporarily. A semblance of order once again return ed. The \"student council,\" as they were nicknamed, acting under the leadership of Mobutu an d Kasavubu, did a far more effective job of restoring order than the official government under Lumumba had done. Here was obviously a bad turn of events for the Com munists. They had not planned on this. Mobutu promptly ordered all the Russian and Czechoslovakia n \"diplomats\" and \"technicians\" to pack their bags and leave the country. Seeing power slip from him, Lumumba sought United Nations protection and quietly moved into the Guinean embassy. It is both interesting and significant that Lumumba chose this particular embassy for asylum. Mobutu had appealed to the United Nations to withdraw the Guinean and Ghanian contingents from its peace-keeping forces in the Congo because he had fo und letters in Lumumba's briefcase which clearly linked these troops with the Communists. 17 It appeared to be common knowledge throughout the C ongo that many of the United Nations soldiers were openly pro-Communist. They were apparently sel ected for that reason. As Philippa Schuyler reported: . . . there have been many complaints from anti- Communists in the Congo that UN soldiers from certain left- leaning nations have been spreading leftist or Communist propaganda or otherwise actively aiding the Red ca use. . . . Some African UN officers I interviewed surprised me by r evealing they spoke Russian, had visited Russia, and were openly sympathetic to the Red cause. \"The UN opens the doors to Communism\" was a comment I heard all over the Congo. 18 Just as a quick aside, it is interesting to note th at Kwame Nkrumah, the prime minister of Ghana, has written that he long ago decided the philosophy of Marx and Lenin was capable of solving his country's problems. He has consistently supported t he Soviet Union and Cuba in the United Nations. In 1960 Red China announced that it would extend $2 5,000,000 in aid to Ghana over a three-year period. And in 1962 the Kremlin awarded Nkrumah the Lenin Peace Prize. In speaking of the award, his own newspaper described him as the Lenin of Afr ica. 19 One of the letters found in Lumumba's briefcase had been written by Nkrumah personally an d said: \"Whenever in doubt, consult me, brother. We have been in the game for some time and now we know how to handle the imperialists and colonialists. The only colonialist or imperiali st that I trust is a dead one.\" 20 Mobutu had good reason to be concerned over the pre sence of troops from Guinea and Ghana and he was certainly justified, in view of their activi ties, in requesting the UN to withdraw them. His ap peal was duly considered. The next day, the United Natio ns specifically assigned soldiers from Guinea and Ghana to provide twenty-four-hour protection fo r Lumumba. The same protection was extended, wherever possible, to Lumumba's followers as well. Conor O'Brien cautiously explained it this way: \"During this time, Hammarskjold and Dayal, his repr esentative in Leopoldville . . . resisted . . . Mobutu's demand that Lumumba, who had sought UN pro tection on September 15th, should be handed over.\" 21 On September 18 Lumumba left the Guinean embassy in a United Nations car and was taken to his well-guarded residence. He shouted from a balcony t o the mob below, \"I am not a prisoner! I am still master! He accused Mobutu of being a fascist and pr omised that he would soon bring back the Communist embassies. That same day, a Lumumbist att empted to assassinate Mobutu who miraculously was not hurt. When Vital Pakasa, the m an who organized the attempted assassination, was found and arrested he explained that the Soviet s had offered him ten thousand dollars for Mobutu's death. 22 A few weeks later, still under strong United Nation s protection, Lumumba was escorted to a gala two- hundred-guest dinner party given by the general fro m Guinea. 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"By this time, most of Lumumba's close supporters we re fleeing to neighboring Stanleyville where another Communist dictator by the name of Antoine G izenga ruled the roost. Finally, Lumumba decided to make a break for it to rejoin his comrad es in Stanleyville. He slipped away from his UN guard and was promptly intercepted and arrested by Colonel Mobutu's forces and deported to Katanga. A few days later, he escaped from his capt ors. According to the story he was seized by villagers and beaten to death. There is also the story that Lumumba was already de ad before they put him on the plane and shipped him to Katanga. (Quite possible.) There is the assertion that Lumumba's old enemy Albert Kalonji in Kasai province had agreed to dispose of Lumumba but changed his mind at the last minute. When the plane arrived, it found the runway covered with oil drums to prevent a landing. Running low on fuel, the plane proceeded to Katanga where no on e expected it. (Not too plausible.) There is the UN \"theory\" that Tshombe personally plunged the dea th knife into Lumumba as he was dragged off the plane. (Unlikely, to say the least.) Regardless of which story appeals most to the imagination, certain facts should be kept in mind. The most impo rtant one is that practically everyone in the whole Congo hated Lumumba. When Colonel Mobutu and Kasavu bu finally had him in their hands, they faced the rather sticky decision of what to do with him. They knew that the UN was doing everything possible to return Lumumba to power. They also knew Lumumba well enough to realize that if this should ever happen they would both be arrested and executed. Obviously, the safest course of action for them was to kill Lumumba or to have someone els e do it. Another fact to keep in mind is that when the UN sent a special team of investigators to the Congo to look into the circumstances surrounding Lumumba's death, it was denied entry, n ot by Katanga, but by the central government. 24 Be that as it may, Lumumba's death triggered off wo rldwide reaction. The loss to the Communists of one of their stooges was more than offset by the pr opaganda gain for Communist objectives. The event was skillfully used to destroy what little pr o-Katanga sentiment there was in America and elsewhere. Newspaper editors eulogized Lumumba and pointed the finger at Tshombe. A howling mob stormed the Belgian embassy in Moscow. In Singa pore, the American embassy was picketed. Wild street demonstrations broke out in London, New Delhi and Belgrade. In Cairo the Belgian embassy was ransacked and gutted. Belgians had to f lee their homes in Egypt. There was even a phony funeral in New York while Black Muslims picke ted the United Nations building. The murder of Lumumba was a savage act. It was foll owed by an equally savage one. In Stanleyville nine anti-Lumumbists who had been held and mistreat ed for months were also murdered. The United Nations conducted no investigations. There were no outcries of indignation or protest from UN spokesmen. There were no spontaneous demonstrations around the world. There were no bleeding heart editorials in our daily newspapers. Here is a silent tribute to the powerful hold that Communist-inspired propaganda has over the minds and attitudes of those in the non-Communist world. It is astounding that so many millions of people could be sincerely shocked and saddened over the de ath of a man like Patrice Lumumba while at the same time feeling little concern over the brutal mu rders of hundreds of anti-Communist leaders in the Congo, Eastern Europe and Red China. Here was a man who was literally unknown to the world until he led his people into chaos. And then, in spite of his clear record as an ex-convict, a dope addict, a murderer and a Communist, he was catapulted into th e hearts of millions who were skillfully conditioned to think of him as a great martyred lea der.

Godefroi Munongo, August 4, 1960 CHAPTER FOUR: THE MODERATES For many years the United States has been financing and supporting the expansion of international Communism around the world through measures which h ave been presented to the American people as ways of fighting Communism. Foreign aid is proba bly the most obvious example. President after president has told us that we have to send billions to various Communist and pro-Communist countries in order to win them away from Soviet dom ination. We have shipped them military equipment, trained their officers in our military s chools, sent them machine tools, built whole factor ies and power dams for them, and sold them subsidized w heat. Our political leaders have shrewdly borrowed the required money from our children and g randchildren who will be saddled with these debts for many generations to come. The record is t ruly fantastic. But the most incredible part of all is that this whole operation, which has been so necess ary for Communist success, has been sold to Americans as a way of opposing Communism. A glance at a few issues of the People's World or the Worker or other Communist periodicals will cause even the skeptical to realize that our foreign aid is very near and dear to the hearts of Communists ever ywhere. The only criticism one finds of our foreign aid program in the Communist press is that it isn't as large and doesn't grow as fast as the Communists want. One of the prime reasons they advo cate foreign aid even to countries that are not yet totally Communist but are merely in the sociali st (or transitional) phase, is that it helps to des troy private enterprise and strengthen socialism within these countries. The money must never be allowed to be used to develop private industry. It must be used only for government projects. For instance, back in 1955 when the Communist party of India form ally announced its support of Nehru, the Communist Daily Worker carried a description of the event. Toward the end of the article it quoted Ajoy Ghosh, general secretary of the Communist part y in India, as saving: \"We want foreign aid coming at a governmental level and not with a speci fic purpose.\" He further said Indians should be \"free to use the aid for anything we want.\" 1 That, however, is another story. It is mentioned he re merely to point up a recognizable pattern that has developed over the past few years regarding cer tain United States State Department policies. This pattern is involved with convincing the voters that a particular policy of the State Department o r the United Nations is in the best interests of the United States when, in reality, it is just the oppo site. There is no better illustration of this than the ci rcumstances surrounding United Nations and Washington support of the so-called \"moderate\" cent ral Government that emerged after Lumumba's death. To tell that part of the story, however, it is necessary to take a closer look at Antoine Gizen ga. Gizenga was a minor personality in Congolese politi cs until he was invited to Prague, Czechoslovakia, for Communist cadre training. 2 When he returned, he became one of Lumumba's strongest supporters and worked closely with him to implement plans for the Communist take-over of the whole Congo. When Lumumba was arrested and then killed, Gizenga set himself up as Lumumba's successor. He established a Communist reg ime in the neighboring province of Orientale and gathered all of Lumumba's followers around him. The Soviet and Czechoslovakian diplomats and consular officials who were kicked out of Leopoldvi lle by Colonel Mobutu popped up in the Gizenga stronghold of Stanleyville where they quickly recei ved official accreditation. The Soviets lost no tim e in announcing to the world that they now recognized Gizenga's regime as the \"only legitimate Government of the Congo.\" 3 With this background in mind it may still come as a shock to some to recall that at this point the United Nations swung its full support and influence behind Gizenga and did everything it could to hamper Colonel Mobutu and President Kasavubu. This is doubly hard to justify because Mobutu and Kasavubu represented the central government, which had called in the United Nations in the first place. Gizenga's little Communist satellite of Orie ntale province was just as much secessionist as Katanga province had been. But the United Nations m ade no effort to end Gizenga's secession. It"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"passed no angry resolutions in the Security Council . It initiated no massive troop movements. In fact, as has been pointed out, it used what few troops it did have in Orientale province to protect Gizenga and his followers. Stewart Alsop, writing in the Saturday Evening Post , described it this way: The United Nations policy has been, in essence, to immob ilize the forces controlled by the Kasavubu- Mobutu regime. . . . Dayal [United Nations representative in the Congo] has ruled that Mobutu' s army should be permitted to make only minor troop movements. . . . With the Kasavubu- Mobutu forces thus effectively hamstrung, and with help from Egyptians and iron cu rtain money and technicians, Gizenga's rump pro- Communist regime quickly consolidated its position. . . . Gizenga's forces then began moving on neighboring Kivu and Katanga provinces. The troop movements w ere by no means minor by Congolese standards, but the United Nations did not hing. . . . Mobutu was certainly a sad and harried man when I saw him. If the United Nations under Dayal had not actively obstructed every move be mad e, he said, he could have dealt in fairly short order with the Stanleyville d issidents. 4 While all this was going on, Moise Tshombe was maki ng efforts of his own to reunite the Congo along the federal lines previously discussed. On Fe bruary 28 he met with a representative of the central government and one from Kasai province. The re was immediate agreement on basic principles and the conference ended with all three signing a mutual defense pact to prevent the establishment of what they referred to as a United Nations \"regime of tyranny.\" 5 On March 8 Tshombe convened a second conference, this time exp anded to include virtually every Congolese leader of importance except the Communist Gizenga. Complete agreement was reached in record time. At the conclusion of the third day, the confe rees issued a communiqué revealing that they all endorsed Tshombe's basic plan calling for a \"commun ity of Congolese states.\" There was to be a central government at Leopoldville in a neutral zon e similar to the District of Columbia. Kasavubu was to remain president, serving on a council of states made up of the presidents of the member states. Foreign policy, a general internal policy, currency and military affairs would come under jurisdiction of this council of states. There were to be no customs or immigration barriers between the states. It was obviously fashioned very closely after the American pattern of government. In a final telegram to Dag Hammarskjold, the Congolese leaders warned that the dispatch of more UN troops to the Congo would \"aggravate tension\" between the United Nation s and the Congolese population. Tshombe said at the conclusion of the conference, \"We have resol ved our problems ourselves and now we want both West and East to leave us alone.\" The Soviet n ews agency Tass responded by denouncing the meeting as \"a conference of puppets and traitors.\" 6 Here was a giant step toward unity and the restorat ion of order in the Congo. The United Nations, however, was not pleased. For one thing, it was ups et over the form of the new union, maintaining that it was much too decentralized. For another, it s man Gizenga was not at the conference. Consequently, the UN ignored the whole thing, as th ough pretending the conference never took place. United Nations troops and armaments continued to ro ll into the Congo--most of them to Katanga--just as rapidly as U.S. Air Force Globemasters could bri ng them. Congolese leaders began to see the handwriting on the wall. Few of them had the streng th of conviction that Tshombe possessed, and the weaker ones began to wonder if perhaps it might not be safer to go along with whatever the United Nations wanted. Finally, on April 17, 1961, the United Nations, in spite of its promise not to intervene in the internal affairs of the Congo, pre ssured Kasavubu into signing an agreement which directly repudiated the principles agreed upon by t he Congolese leaders. But Tshombe did not find this out until six days later when he arrived at a third conference of Congolese leaders. The atmosphere had changed completely. Kasavubu and som e of the others no longer spoke of a confederation of states. Their demands were now ide ntical with those of the United Nations. Feeling completely betrayed, Tshombe walked out of the conf erence and prepared to return to Katanga. As he arrived at the airport, however, he was arrested without any pretense of legality and thrown into"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"prison. A few days later, Tshombe was formally char ged on four counts of high 'treason, two of which were punishable by death. 7 Tshombe was kept in prison for two months. At no ti me was he allowed to see his attorney. He apparently was not subjected to physical torture, b ut be was, nevertheless, kept in solitary confinement. He was given no exercise, nothing to r ead, and no one with whom to talk. A few months previously the United Nations had provided extravag ant military protection for Patrice Lumumba and had loudly protested when he was arrested by Colone l Mobutu's men. Now that Tshombe was in jail, however, things were different. There were no prote sts or offers of protection. In fact, the world's s elf- proclaimed champions of justice and human rights re mained strangely silent. The enemies of Katanga expected Tshombe's arrest to set off a power struggle among his supporters back home. They reasoned hopefully that a new shuff le would possibly bring to the top someone more pliable and more willing to go along with Unit ed Nations policies. They were wrong on two counts. First of all, the strong man in the number two spot and the most likely to take Tshombe's place was Godefroi Munongo who was, if anything, mo re like Tshombe than Tshombe himself. Also, Tshombe had earned such complete respect and loyalt y from his followers that the expected power struggle never happened. His cabinet and parliament closed ranks in his absence and proclaimed their solidarity. Posters began appearing on the st reets of Elisabethville with huge pictures of Tshombe and the words \"He suffers for us. Let us be worthy of him.\" It was fortunate for Tshombe that Lumumba was no lo nger top wheel in the central government. Otherwise, he would never have been seen again. But Kasavubu, even though he was now dancing to the UN tune, was not a vicious person. He was me rely a weak politician who wanted to be on the winning side. Tshombe, however, still maintained the loyalty of h is followers, and with the personal intervention of Colonel Mobutu he was finally released on June 22. Joyous mayhem broke out in Katanga when the news was received. A few days later, he was back at work with more determination than ever. There was an ominous note of anticipated tragedy in Tshom be's voice as he addressed the national assembly: \"We shall see to it that the Katangese Na tion shall endure. Let the enemies of Katanga know that they have to deal with a people.\" 8 Turning our attention back to the United Nations \"m oderates\" in the central government, a new figure appears. He is Cyrille Adoula, former associate and supporter of Patrice Lumumba. He claims that he is not a Communist, but on December 28, 1957, he wr ote: Being a socialist I am for the transformation of th e present society. And for this I conceive the collectivisation of the means of production. In ord er to attain this goal, I see only one means: the struggle of the classes, the permanent class strugg le . 9 Since the Communists advocate exactly the same thin g, and since they also frequently refer to themselves as socialists instead of Communists, the distinction is not particularly reassuring. But what a man does is far more important than whether or not be may have been formally issued a membership card. If he does the work of the Communi sts, even unknowingly, he is just as dangerous as the most devoted and disciplined party member. On August 2, 1961, the Congolese parliament approve d Cyrille Adoula as the new premier. One of his first official acts was to invite all the Russi an and Czech diplomats to return their Communist embassies to Leopoldville--which they did. Next, it was announced that Antoine Gizenga, leader of the Communist faction in Stanleyville, had been app ointed to the number two spot of vice-premier. It is not clear just how much Adoula had to do with th is appointment since Mr. Sture Linner (United Nations representative in Leopoldville) has publicl y claimed personal credit for persuading Gizenga to accept the position. 10 Nevertheless, on August 16 Adoula visited Gizenga in Stanleyville to work out"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"plans for their new government. A few days later th ey both spoke publicly and embraced each other for news photographers. Gizenga announced that he w as dissolving his provisional government in favor of the new coalition and added, \"The governme nt will have to follow the Lumumba line . . .\" 11 Soon afterward, Moscow radio announced that the Ado ula regime would put into operation \"all decisions previously made by Lumumba's govemment.\" 12 The position of minister of the interior--which inc ludes complete control of the police--was filled by another Prague-trained Communist, Christophe Gbenye . Gbenye had previously served under Gizenga and was the man who was directly responsibl e for instigating the murder, rape and terrorization of European residents in Orientale pr ovince. 13 Counting heavily on the UN to bring Katanga's seces sion to an end, the central government appointed Egide Bochely-Davidson as the chief admin istrator of Katanga province. Bochely-Davidson was not only a Communist, but a member of the Sovie t secret police. 14 As the Newark Star-Ledger explained on September 24, 1961: The Reds may have . . . made a deal by which a Comm unist woul d succeed Tshombe as boss of Katanga. The central government of the Congo republic recently named Egide Bochely-Davidson--a Moscow-tra ined agent-- as chief administrator of Katanga province. He was supposed to take over the provincial government with the support of United Nations troop s. . . . If Bochely- Davidson can consolidate his position in Katanga, the Reds w ill be one step closer to victory in the Congo-- with the aid of American dollars, United Nations so ldiers, and the late Dag Hammarskjold. The Moscow Times gloated: On August 2nd, a new government was formed in the C ongo composed of 27 ministers and 17 state secretaries. Cyrille Adoula was appointed prime- minister. According to the Stanleyville newspaper, Uhuru , the members of political parties of the national bloc which was headed by Patrice Lumumba have 23 seats in the government, or an absolute majority. The compositio n of this new cabinet proves that adventurous efforts to liquidate the governmen t of Lumumba completely failed. The decision of the p arliament commits the new government to carry out all decisions made earlier by the Lumumba Governmen t. . . . 15 When addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, Adoula was careful to let everyone know exactly where he stood. He referred to the lat e Lumumba as his \"national hero\" and to Gizenga as his \"good friend.\" 16 This was the government that high officials in the UN and in Washington were piously describing as \"moderate.\" The same State Department that refused to allow Tshombe to visit the United States and even went as far as to cancel the visa of the head of the Katanga Information Service in this country, rolled out the red carpet for Adoula. The following statement by G. Mennen Williams, State Department spokesman for African affairs, is typica l of the kind of black-is-white pronouncements that have become all too common from State Department of ficials: A moderate parliamentary central government under P rime Minister Cyrille Adoula has been formed, and it is operating effecti vely and supported broadly everywhere except in Katanga. The pretensions of th e opposition Orientale province government have been ended and Gizenga has been effectively neutralized. The C ommunists have been barred from continuing their di rect support of left- wing elements in the Congo. . . . If present means do not succeed, the Adoula government may be replaced by a radical one, or, as an alternative, the Adoula government may be obliged t o seek help from others than those now helping them. This would mean, in all likelihood, h elp from more radical sources. "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The net result would be to discredit the UN and the U.S. and open the possibility of chaos in the Congo--chaos which would invite Com mu nist intervention in the heart of Africa. This alternative the world cannot contemplate with equanimity. 17 At about the same time, Mr. George Ball, undersecre tary of state, solemnly told a Los Angeles audience that Katanga's independence \"can only plac e in jeopardy the success of our efforts in the Congo as a whole, threaten the entire Congo with ch aos and civil war, and lead to the establishment of a Communist base in the heart of Central Africa. The armed secession in Katanga plays into the hands of the Communists. This is a fact that all Am ericans should ponder.\" 18 President Kennedy held a special luncheon in Adoula 's honor at the White House. Rising to present a toast, Kennedy said: Gentlemen, I am sure you all join me in welcoming t o this country the guest of honor and the members of his government. . . . The difficulties of our revolutionary experience, and the experiences of ev ery other people coming into independence si nce the end of World War II, pale in comparison to the problems which the Congo has faced and which press upon the prime minister and his supporters. What makes him especially welcome is th e courage and the fortitude, the persistence and the judgment with which he has met these challenges-- which would have overwhelmed a lesser people, a les ser country, a lesser man, a lesser government. Prime Minister, we welcome you here for many reasons. The success of the Congo is tied up, reall y, we believe, with the su ccess of the UN. If you fail and the Congo should f ail, it would be a serious blow for the UN, upon which this country has placed so many hopes for the last 17 years . . . . 19 NOTES 1. \"Indian Communists Back Nehru Position,\" Daily Worker (June 30,1955), p. 2. 2.

The Communist record of Gizenga, Adoula's vice-prem ier, was so well known that it embarrassed western supporters of the regime. As his pro-Commun ist bias became more and more difficult to conceal, it was decided to \"arrest\" Gizenga as proo f of the central government's anti-Communism. Supporters of UN policy in the non-Communist world received much mileage from this maneuver. What most people were not allowed to learn, however , was that Gizenga was quietly set free soon afterward. According to Philippa Schuyler, his \"prison\" was a comfortable villa by the sea. Even A dlai Stevenson refrained from saying that Gizenga was in jail. In an article distributed by the UN association in Los Angeles, he is quoted as saying that Gizenga had been under \"house arrest.\" See \"Stevenson Answers Critics on Congo,\" Los Angeles Times (February 10, 1963). 16. \"Adoula Receives Royal Welcome,\" the Tablet (Brooklyn, February 17, 1962). As this book is going to press, the elections in the Congo are near ing. Since the basic sentiments of the masses of Congolese people (as distinguished from many of the ir leaders) are anti-Soviet, the Adoula regime has recently put on a rather convincing show of ant i-Communism in its public pronouncements. It has even expelled the Communist embassies from Leopoldv ille. Whether or not this appearance of anti- Communism will be dropped after the elections or wh ether it represents a true stiffening of Adoula's political backbone, will remain to be seen. 17.

Psalm 55:21 CHAPTER FIVE: IN THE LAST RESORT While the world mourned the death of Lumumba, the U nited Nations expressed its own anger and concern by passing a resolution on February 21, 196 1, which said: The Security Council . . . having learned with deep regret the announcement of the killing of the Congolese leader, Mr. Patr ice Lumumba . . . urges that measures be taken for the immediate withdrawal and evacuation from the Congo of all Belgian and other foreign military and param ilitary personnel and political advisors not under United Nations command. . . . This was obviously aimed at Katanga since that was the only province in the whole Congo with appreciable numbers of European military officers. There are several interesting and revealing aspects to that resolution. First, there was the honorable mention of Lumumba, whose demise was the occasion o f \"deep regret\" for the Security Council. Secondly, there was the outright intrusion of the U N into internal affairs of Katanga on the bold-face d assertion that it had a right to tell Katanga what it could or could not do. Nothing in the United Nat ions Charter gives the UN authority to dictate to a coun try who may or may not be employed by that country in its own army. This is clearly an interna l affair of the Congo. Yet paradoxically the same resolution reaffirmed that \"the United Nations forc e in the Congo will not be a party to or in any way intervene in or be used to influence the outcome of any internal conflict, constitutional or otherwise .\" It went even further and acknowledged that \"the soluti on of the problem of the Congo lies in the hands of the Congolese people themselves without any inte rference from outside . . .\" In the light of subsequent United Nations intervent ion in the Congo, one can only be astounded at the extent of hypocrisy displayed by UN officials. But hidden away in the language of bureaucratese is an indication of the UN's true, and not-so-honorable, intentions toward the Congo. In the very same resolution, the UN authorized itself to employ \" the use of force, if necessary, in the last resort .\" There it was--the first glimpse--the clear and unmistakab le outline of the mailed fist beneath the velvet glove. Promising not to interfere in Katanga and at the ve ry same time authorizing the use of force to interfere is the kind of double-talk that politicia ns through the ages have used to make their grab fo r unlimited power appear to be legal and proper. Thes e pronouncements do not happen accidentally, nor are they the result of ignorance and incompeten ce. They are the mark of corrupt political skill, t he product of unlimited cynicism tempered by years of experience. The men who have mastered this skill are proud of their accomplishment and are qui ck to admire it in others. Conor O'Brien was such a man. Expressing his unqualified approval of the Uni ted Nations resolution, he wrote: The contradictions and equivocations in that mandat e allowed them a good deal of leeway, and this, as I have mentioned, Hammarskj old was adept at using. Sometimes, as I heard some feat of interpretation, some especially refined harmonizatio n of S/4426 paragraph 4 with A/Res. 1474 paragraph 2, and noted how neatly it fitted the political needs of the mom ent, I was reminded of an excellent formula invented by a Central American ch airman of the first committee, when he found it desirable to str etch the rules a little for the benefit of Mr. Cabot Lodge: \"Under the rule,\" he said, \"it wou ld seem that the delegate is not permitted to speak at this stage. I shall, howe ver, interpret the rule in the spirit of the principles of philosophical jurisprud ence. I give the floor to the "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"representative of the United States.\" The men round the table on the 38th floor (the \"Con go club\"] were often inspired by the spirit of philosophical jurisprudence, and i ndeed the Congo operation, if it were to be carried on a t all, demanded such a spirit. 1 At four o'clock in the morning on August 28 while E lisabethville slept in peace, the United Nations, exercising its philosophical jurisprudence, launche d a surprise attack on the city. In the early hours of morning darkness it took over all communications ce nters, put a blockade around the foreign minister's residence, surrounded the barracks of th e Katangese army, and arrested over four hundred European officers and noncoms. Simultaneously it be gan arresting and expelling from the country hundreds of other European residents who were suspe cted of being technicians or advisors. There was practically no resistance, since, as it was lea rned later, the Belgian officers who were on loan t o Tshombe's army were under orders from their governm ent not to fire on United Nations troops. 2 In one fell swoop, Katanga's army was decapitated of i ts professional leadership. Soldiers and civilians alike were taken from their families at bayonet poi nt, rounded up in detention centers, and expelled from the country, often with nothing but the clothe s on their backs. There were no charges brought against them, no hearings, no habeas corpus, no rig ht of appeal, no opportunity to put their personal affairs in order. It was a police-state operation. 3 Time magazine described it this way: The 11,600 black Katangese troops remained passive, possibly because UN soldiers staged furious public bayonet drills and s mall arms exercises in a pointed show of power. Remarked one senior . . . UN officer: \"We have these soldiers scared witless.\" 4 The forty-six civilian doctors of Elisabethville sh ed further light on the action when they reported: Hundreds of houses were searched by the men of the UNO without result, dozens of European civilians arrested and threatene d with the foulest brutalities if they did not admit having helped, sheltered or s imply known \"mer cenaries\" or volunteers. Houses searched without any result? Alas, not alway s. Failing, to find mercenaries , which was perhaps dangerous, one fell back upon a nice little compensating looting, which is not so dangerous when one is . . . armed; and if the house which was being visited was empty, a little ransacking was included. 5 Operation Rumpunch (the UN code name for the August attack) was a success. Only a handful of European officers remained in the Katangese army. T he mercenaries, as the UN called them, had been expelled. As we have seen, the UN--in the beginning, at least --justified its action against Katanga on the claim that it had to remove Tshombe's mercenaries. Aside from the fact that the composition of the Katangese army is not the concern of the UN, United Nations troops themselves were mercenaries of the first order. Irish, Swedish, Italian, Ethiopian and Gurkha troops were fighting as hired agents of the UN. If the mercenary issue was a real one, why did not the United Nations insist that the Indonesian Communist Kwame Nkrumah get rid of the B ritish officers in his army? What would one call the American officers serving in Laos? The tru th of the matter is that the whole mercenary issue was nothing but an excuse for the United Nations to initiate military action against Katanga with the ultimate objective of bringing it under the control of the Communist-dominated central government. By removing the professional leadership from Katang a's army, the UN not only reduced the chances"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"of effective military opposition to its own future plans, but also greatly enhanced the return of civi l disorder and chaos to Katanga province--the very th ing that it professed to be there to prevent. At any rate, Tshombe did not throw in the towel as the UN apparently expected. Katanga did not fall apart. Tshombe had been expecting something like th is and had initiated a crash program to train African officers and noncoms for effective leadersh ip. The program was far from complete, but sufficient progress had been made to enable Katanga to stand firm in its determination to remain independent. Tshombe appointed a Colonel Muké as co mmander of the army, and Katanga now had not only an African president and an African govern ment but an African commander as well. It soon became obvious that if Katanga were to topple, even stronger measures would have to be taken. On the morning of September 11, Conor O'Brien met w ith Moise Tshombe and once again gave his personal assurances that the United Nations had no intentions of intervening in the internal affairs o f Katanga or of using force in the settlement of any issue. 6 That very same day, however, he met in secret with other UN officials and helped lay detai led plans for another surprise military attack on Elisabethville. The following is O'Brien's own desc ription of those plans: As regards Tshombe, we were to arrest him only in t he last resort. His residence was to be cut off, the entries and exits to it sealed, and then I was to parley with him, making it clear that his only hope lay in coop erating with the United Nations, and in peacefully liquidating the secession of Kata nga. Meanwhile, UN forces were to secure the post office and the radio studio s and transmitters, and to raid the offices of sûreté and ministry of information a nd remove the files. Europeans and senior African personnel working in these depar tments were to be apprehended if possible. The flag of the Republic o f the Congo should be run up at the earliest appropriate moment on public buildi ngs and on UN buildings; we had a supply of these flags which Michel Tombelaine had recently brought back from Leopoldville. The central government would sen d down a commissaire d’etat to take over author ity, in cooperation with Tshombe if possible, in cooperation with the United Nations in any case. . . . We all knew, of course, that the mercenaries still at large would be likely to undertake some action, but we did not take this ver y seriously because of their small numbers. . . . As regards the timing, Khiary said that the operati on should be carried out either before three o'clock on the afternoon of Wednesday, Septe mber 13th-- the time that Hammarskjold was due to arrive in Leopoldville --or after Hammar skjold's departure, estimated for three days later. Hammarsk jold had given authority for these operations, but it would be embarrassing for him if fighting were actually going on in Katanga while he was in Leopoldville. . . . Khiary asked how long, if figh ting did break out, it would take to bring the situation under control. Raja [UN military commande r] said that the points where there was a danger of resistance were the post offi ce and the radio studio. Even if this were determined resistance, it could be ended in, at most, two hours. In this, Raja's prediction was perfectly correct. In the light of my insistence on urgency, and Raja' s assurance of the duration of possible resistance, Khiary agreed that the operati ons should be carried out early on the morning of September 13th. 7 Operation Morthor, as it was called, went off accor ding to schedule. Once again moving under cover of early morning darkness the United Nations \"peace -keepers\" stormed the communication and transportation nerve centers of Elisabethville. Wit hin hours the UN-controlled radio station announced, \"The secession is over! Arrest the white s! The secession is over! Arrest the whites!\" 8"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Egide Bochely-Davidson, the Communist who had been appointed by the central government to administer Katanga province, was flown by UN plane to Elisabethville's airport to take control just as soon as the fighting stopped in the center of the c ity. (Dag Hammarskjold had said previously: \"United Nations facilities cannot be used, for example, to transport civilian or military representatives, und er the authority of the central government, to Katanga against the decision of the Katanga provincial government.\" 9 ) At this point, however, Operation Morthor began to fall apart. Katangese troops launched a counterattack on all fronts as full scale fighting spread to practically every sector of the city. Con trol of the radio station moved back and forth between forc es as one of the obviously important military objectives. Bochely-Davidson impatiently paced up a nd down at the airport as the distant sound of machine-gun chatter and mortar explosions grew loud er by the minute. This time Katanga was fighting back. American newspapers carried the following account: The battle for Elisabethville exploded into full wa r today, with casualti es estimated in excess of 1,000. The UN declared marti al law and . . . Michel Tombelaine of France, deputy UN civilian commander, announced over the UN controlled radio that any civilians found in illega l possession of arms will be summarily executed. 10 Michel Tombelaine was identified as a member of the French Communist party by a subcommittee of the United States Senate on August 6, 1962. 11 In an effort to capture and control the post office , the United Nations set up strategic military posi tions under the protection of a large hospital which they had conveniently established across the street. To their credit, the United Nations doctors there fina lly resigned en masse, stating \"the building was being turned into a support fortress.\" 12 The forty-six civilian doctors of Elisabethville re ported: The hospital of the Italian Red Cross, which is sit uated behind the post office and opposite the Banque du Congo, was militarised BV th e UNO. The personnel of this hospital wore the uniforms of the UNO. Already before Sept ember 13, 1961 [when the attack began], this hospital was in a sta te of armed defence: sandbags, shelters for riflemen and machine-gunners . . . . . . . on the morning of September 13th, the alleged defences were really used as combat stations from which, a t the beginning of the attack on the post office by the mercenaries of the UNO, a well- sustained fire helped the massacre of the defenders of this public building. 13 UPI correspondent Ray Moloney drove a hundred miles to Bancroft in Northern Rhodesia to file the following eyewitness account: I watched the counterattack from inside the UN R ed Cross hospital which had machine guns set up along the terrace. United Natio ns troops were firing from the hospital in the shadow of a giant Red Cross fla g. . . . I also saw UN troops fire on a Katangese ambulance as it tried to reach the twitching bodi es of unarmed Katangese police who were ripped to pieces by UN machine- gun bullets after the cease fire sounded. 14 Frustrated in its anticipation of an easy victory, the United Nations began to turn Operation Morthor into Operation Terror. Blue-helmeted soldiers displ aying the UN emblem of peace fired wantonly at civilians, ambulances, automobiles--anything that m oved. A Roman Catholic priest was murdered on"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"his way to collect the Holy Sacrament from St. Paul 's Convent; the charred remains of his body were later found in the burned shell of his automobile w hich had been hit by a bazooka shot from a United Nations armored car. An ambulance man, dressed in w hite and wearing a Red Cross armband was machine-gunned while stepping out of his ambulance to help the wounded; his leg had to be amputated to save his life. A housewife was murdere d while riding with her husband down a peaceful street to buy groceries. These and literally hundre ds of similar cases have been carefully documented. There are always unfortunate killings o f innocent civilians as the accidental by-product of any war. But the consistent pattern of such atro cities in Katanga clearly reveals that they could only have been the result of deliberate design. Beginning on September 18 and continuing several ti mes daily, UN convoys traveling along the Boulevard Rhine Elisabeth and Avenue Stanley fired machine guns at virtually every home they passed. The one dwelling that received the most pun ishment of all was the home of a Dr. and Mrs. Szeles, Hungarian refugees who fled from similar tr eatment at the hands of the Communists in 1948. His home was clearly identified by an enormous Red Cross flag. Several ambulances were usually parked in front. For days on end UN troops machine- gunned this house twice a day--as convoys were deployed in the morning and when they returned in the late afternoon. On one occasion hand grenades were thrown in the windows. Mrs. Szeles, w ho had sought shelter in the corridor, was badly wounded by the explosions. Dr. Szeles counted 355 b ullet holes in the walls of his home. All the windows were broken, the furniture smashed to piece s, the whole house reduced to shambles. Fleeing from Communist terror in Hungary at the age of fifty, Dr. Szeles came to Katanga to start a new life. Ten years later, at the age of sixty, be is once again deprived of his home--thanks to the organization that was supposedly created \"to save s ucceeding generations from the scourge of war.\" 15 At the height of the UN attack on Elisabethville, M r. Georges Olivet, the Swiss international Red Cross representative there, cabled an appeal to his Geneva office to persuade the United Nations to stop firing on Red Cross vehicles. A few days later he disappeared while on a mercy mission to UN headquarters. It was not until eleven days afterwar d that his wrecked ambulance was found. It had been bit with bazooka rockets and machine-gunned by United Nations troops. In an attempt to conceal the crime, the UN soldiers had hurriedly bu ried Mr. Olivet and his two companions in a shallow grave next to the road. The United Nations issued two contradictory explanations of what happened. The first one charged that European merce naries of the Katangese army had kidnapped Olivet. Later, when the evidence was disclosed, it admitted that the vehicle had been struck by UN fire but claimed that it was an accident caused by Olivet’s driving \"into cross fire.\" 16 When the Red Cross asked for an official investigation into this matter, the United Nations--which had launched an extensive investigation of Lumumba's death--denied the request on the basis that it did not have \"adequate legal or technical resources.\" 17 The Roman Catholic bishop of Elisabethville accused the United Nations of \"sacrilegious profanities\" and revealed that their troops had deliberately des troyed and looted churches and had wantonly murdered innocent civilians. 18 More than ninety percent of the buildings bombed by UN aircraft were strictly civilian structures with no possible military value. As briefly described in the opening passages of this book, the operation rapidly assumed the aspect of full-scale war. With all utilities cut and no refrigeration, civilians r ushed about frantically trying to find something to eat a nd drink. A light rain brought thankful Katangans t o every rain spout to collect the life-saving drinkin g water. The stench of rotting food hung over the c ity and mingled with the smell of death. The Communist press around the world was jubilant. Even in Rome the Social Democratic La Guistizia said that the UN had succeeded \"in bringing back p eace,\" and the Communist newspaper L'Unità called Operation Morthor \"a hard defeat for the co lonialists and their agents.\" 19 Miraculously, Katanga held the UN at bay. News corr espondent Peter Younghusband gave the following eyewitness report in an article datelined Elisabethville, September 15, 1961:"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" Katanga Province President Tshombe said yesterday t hat he and his people will fight \"to the last drop of blood\" to keep Katanga i ndependent. I spoke to Tshombe in a small villa situated in t he grounds of his official residence. Mortar shell explosions and machine- gun fire could be heard throughout the city. I was astonished when a Belgian settler told me that Tsho mbe was not in hiding as reported Tuesday, but was still in his residence an d of fered to take me there. I went and found the residence heavily defended by tr oops with machine guns in the gardens and armored cars in the road outside. The president, haggard and eyes bloodshot from lack of sleep, said, \"Did you think I would run away whe n my soldiers are fighting and dying for their coun try? We will fight to the bitter end and, if necessary, the last battle will be here in my home, and I will be part of it.\" President Tshombe said he was prepared to negotiate with the UN for a cease-fire if they would withdraw from the center of the city and refrain from attacking his troops and leave him to settle his affairs with the central Congo government in his own time. \"They have lied to me and have murdered my people,\" he said. \"I appeal to the free world-- to Britain, to France, to America-- to all nations who treasure the principles of freed om and the right of a people to self- determination to bring this terrible thing to an en d.\" . . . Elisabethville is a terror town of shattered buildi ngs and des erted streets, where bullets whine and ricochet. . . . Belgian settlers who armed themselves to the teeth and joined the Katanga army in the fight for Katanga's freedom include former war veterans and police officers. Other civi lians organized food and wat er supplies to the troops. All Elisabethville's hospit als are filled with wounded. I visited the Katanga radio station, which is now not hing more than a blackened shell of a building, doorless and windowless with s mashed radio equipment, furniture, telepho nes, steel helmets and boots all lying in a jumbled mess. Outside, I counted thirteen corpses still lying in the grass nearby, all Katanga police and all. inexplicably, shot in the back. UN troops yesterday again fired on a Katanga army ambulance displayin g Red Crosses, seriously wounding the African driver and two white nurses. 20 Tshombe, speaking to his people over a hidden trans mitter that identified itself as \"Radio Free Katanga,\" called for total resistance--\"a fight to the last round of ammunition.\" Five thousand Baluba warriors responded by joining the Katangese soldier s. Several hundred Bayeke warriors also came into the fight. White residents took up arms and fo ught side-by-side with their African neighbors. The y were not mercenaries. Nobody paid them. They volunt eered to fight for the simple reason that the United Nations was destroying their homes and killi ng their loved ones. Finally, the tide began to turn. The UN had prematu rely announced to the world that the secession was over. It was now in serious danger of having it s forces completely annihilated because of the unexpected determination of the Katangese people to maintain their independence. As supplies and morale began to run low, it became obvious that the UN had made the fatal mistake of believing its own propaganda. It had asserted that Tshombe was a mere puppet of the Belgians and that he was supported in power only by a few mercenaries agains t the true will of his people. It maintained that his government would collapse at the first blow. It was now paving the price of self-deception. Things were going so badly for the United Nations that by September 17 its whole company A was cut off, badly beaten, and forced to surrender. With Operati on Morthor on the verge of total collapse, the UN finally agreed to a face-saving cease-fire. On Sept ember 20, just one week after the United Nations had launched its unprovoked attack, peace once agai n returned to Katanga; its green and white flag still fluttered proudly to proclaim that Katanga re mained free. The only thing more incredible than the United Nati ons military action in Katanga is the way in which it tried to justify that action. If things had gone according to schedule there would have been little trouble. Press releases would have simply stated th at Tshombe had been replaced by \"moderate\" Bochely-Davidson and that after a light exchange of gunfire \"secessionist\" Katanga had been brought"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"back under the central government. The United State s President would have sent his congratulations to Dag Hammarskjold and State Department officials would have expressed great satisfaction with this victory over Communism. But as it turned out, the situation had \"escalated,\" and there were just too many newspaper reporters willing to make that h undred-mile trek to Northern Rhodesia to get the true story out to the world. 21 At one point, the UN explained that it had initiate d military action at the request of the central government. An official spokesman elaborated: \"The UN motive in complying with the request was to avoid the alternative--invasion of northern Katanga by central government troops and a prolonged civil war.\" 22 In other words, the central Government was prepari ng to attack Katanga; but that would have been civil war. Therefore, the UN attacked Kat anga to save the central Government the trouble! As the fighting spread, it became apparent that the United Nations needed another story. As a result, it was decided to announce that the UN had nothing to do with starting the action at all--that it was merely defending itself against Katangese aggressio n. And so, on September 16, three days after the United Nations had stated it had initiated the acti on \"at the request of the central government,\" Dag Hammarskjold, at a press conference, told this fant astic story: In the early hours of September 13th . . . an alert was set since arson was discovered at the UN garage. As the UN troops were proceeding toward the garage premises, fire was opened on them from the b uilding where a number of foreign officers are known to be staying. UN troops were subsequently also resisted and fired at as they, were deploying towar d key points or while they were guarding installations in the City. 23 In the words of Conor O'Brien, the man who helped p lan the attack: I have no idea what the source for the \"arson\" stat ement may be. No such fire was ever reported by me, or to me, or ever referred to in my presence. Nor is there any reference to such a phenomenon in the mil itary \"situation report.\" Some days before, an empty UN vehicle was upset and damaged by the \"spontaneous demonstrators\" outside a garage in the town (proper ly speaking, there was no \"UN garage\"). This incident, the neare st known to me to the \"arson alarm,\" was no longer present to our minds on the m orning of September 13 th . 24 Just for the record, Operation Morthor comes from a Hindi word. Morthor does not mean \"Sound the alarm; there is arson in the garage\" or \"Let us now assist the authorities to prevent civil war.\" It means smash! NOTES 1. O'Brien, p. 61. 2.

In addition to news reporters, of course, there were many prominent individuals who independently came to Katanga to conduct their own personal investigations. One such observer was Lord Bertrand Russell, a strong, supporter of the U nited Nations. Not only did he confirm the stories of UN atrocities, but the following excerpt from hi s report presents an interesting sidelight on the w ay in which UN officials were becoming overwhelmed by the dilemma of so many impartial observers: \"Next day by appointment I saw General Yakub . . . I told the general that I had been collecting evidence regarding the alleged reports of murder of innocent civilians in Elisabethville by United Nations troops, and that I wanted to ask him some q uestions.

CHAPTER SIX: AH, PEACE The defeat of the United Nations in Katanga was met with anguished cries from the world Communist press. Tass, the Soviet news agency, said that the cease-fire agreement with \"colonialist puppet Tshombe\" evoked only a feeling of \"indignation.\" Th e Tass writer, V. Kharokov, complained that what had been a promising UN operation to end Katanga's secession had turned out to be \"a total flop.\" 1 The Communists, however, were unduly concerned, for the UN was not giving up yet. It was using the cease-fire merely as a means of building up its strength for a renewed attack. Immediately, additional troops began to arrive on the scene: The first four of fourteen UN jets landed at Leopoldville. The buildup was both extensive and ra pid. Finally, on November 24, 1961, the Security Council swung into action once again. It passed ano ther resolution strongly condemning Katanga for its continued use of mercenaries and then authorize d the further use of force to bring it under the control of the central government. The velvet glove was now completely off. This amounted to a declaration of war against Katanga. Tshombe was qui ck to realize this and, addressing a crowd of eight thousand cheering Africans two days later, he said that the United Nations would soon \"undertake war on our territory. . . . Tomorrow or the day after, there will be a trial of strength. L et us prepare for it. Let Katanga fighters arise at the g iven moment in every street, every lane, every road and every village. I will give you the signal at th e opportune time.\" 2 Minister of the Interior Munongo later echoed Tshom be's sentiment when he proclaimed: \"We are all here, resolved to fight and die if necessary. The U N may take our cities. There will remain our villages and the bush. All the tribal chiefs are al erted. We are savages; we are Negroes. So be it! We shall fight like savages with our arrows.\" 3 While the UN military buildup was taking place, tro ops of the central government began to move into position to invade the regions of northern Katanga. Since this would be civil war, and since the UN said it was in the Congo to prevent civil war, one might expect the peace-keepers to do something about it. They did. They provided large quantities of supplies and helped transport the central government troops into Katanga. The UN referred to this as a \"police action.\" The chief UN representative in the Congo, Sture Linner, further explained that any move on the part of Tshombe to secure his defensive military position along Katang a's borders would be considered an act of civil war and that the UN would take action to prevent it. 4 The central government was getting impatient to nai l Tshombe's hide to the wall. Justin Bomboko, the Congolese foreign minister who had previously broug ht charges of high treason against Tshombe, later revealed the prevailing mood of his governmen t when he said: \"Tshombe only understands the language of force and pressure. . . . We can negoti ate for 100 years with Tshombe, but it will be in vain. There is no hope of solving this problem by p eaceful means. We lose our time, and this is the reason why we went to the UN and Washington.\" 5 What kind of troops were these that the UN brought into Katanga and sustained with supplies and jet air cover? They were mostly the same mutinous bunch that had been on the rampage for many months. Their numbers included several thousand of those whom Tshombe had kicked out of his army and who had since reenlisted in Leopoldville. The rest were from Gizenga's former Communist stronghold of Stanleyville. A few weeks earlier, Gizenga's soldiers seized and brutally beat thirteen Italian airmen serving the United Nations at Kindu. After the beating the men were shot and cut up into tiny pieces. According to witnesses parts of the bodies were thrown into the Congo River. Others were sold in the market place. A human hand was presented to a United Natio ns doctor by a giggling Congolese soldier."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Colonel Alphonse Pakassa, commander of these soldie rs, when questioned on the subject of the massacre simply shrugged his shoulders and replied, \"You know how soldiers are.\" 6 The world was shocked at the news. But, as usual, m emories were short. These were the very same soldiers that just six weeks later were transported by the United Nations into northern Katanga. 7 After their arrival, they proceeded to slaughter a group of twenty-two Roman Catholic missionaries. This time, however, since the victims were not wearing U N uniforms, there was practically no publicity. 8 Turning southward, these soldiers put whole village s to the torch, slaughtered women and children, and sent over ten thousand families fleeing in pani c. Anyone, black or white, who was found to be armed with even a penknife was killed on the spot. Risking her life to visit the terror zone, newswoman Philippa Schuyler reported: As this story goes to press, the wild, chaotic Cong olese National Army is advancing from the north into Katanga, moving ever southward, r avaging wherever they go, like a diabolic visitation of loc usts. The UN is not stopping their advance. These are wild barbarians, like the fifth century Gauls advancing on Rome, determined to annihilate the bastion of civil ization that remains in Katanga. Sacked by the barbarians, the remainder of the Cong o has already entered the Dark Ages; helped by the UN, these barb aric hordes wish also to plunge Katanga into desolation, ignorance and miser y. 9 In the wake of this imported terror, the entire reg ion began to revert to its primitive origin. With n o local authority to keep peace and order, the native s--afraid and confused--revived ancient and suppressed rituals. Cannibalism was reintroduced. S moldering tribal feuds broke out into full-scale tribal wars. Even the beloved missionaries who were once reasonably safe in the area were terrorized and murdered as a result of the mass hys teria that bad been unleashed. 10 The Katangese forces that previously had been respo nsible for law and order were now fighting for their very lives. A ten-man Katangese patrol led by a local administrative officer, Gregoire Kulu, was ambushed by about one hundred wild savages who cut off Kulu's legs, jammed sticks into the stumps and forced him to run on them before burning him alive. 11 As a result of atrocities of this kind and the onslaught of the central government troops, Tshombe 's gendarmes in the area urgently sent for reinforcements and additional ammunition. Their ple a was denied by the United Nations, however, on the basis that this would enhance civil war and thu s would be in violation of the cease-fire agreement . But once again, Katanga overcame the impossible odd s and finally pushed the invaders back. Order was restored to the territory. By November the inva ders were in full retreat--looting and pillaging as they went. By now the UN had completed its own military buildu p for a renewed assault on Elisabethville. Seeing that the central government could not subdue Tshomb e, the United Nations issued a few more promises not to intervene in the internal affairs o f Katanga and began to draw up plans for its next attack. It came on December 5, just three weeks bef ore Christmas. United Nations troops assaulted a Katangese roadblock, and when the smoke cleared thi rty-eight Katangans lay lifeless in the street. The war was on! From this point the story becomes tragically monoto nous. Once again the United Nations unleashed a reign of terror, death and destruction on peacefu l Elisabethville. Once again the primary targets were hospitals, churches, homes, ambulances and sho ps. Once again the victims were civilians-- men, women and children. And, once again, the Secre tary-General insisted that the United Nations was merely fighting back as the innocent victim of Katanga's aggression. The only changes were that Conor O'Brien had been recalled and U Thant was now issuing the contradictory statements instead of Dag Hammarskjold. Thant stated on December 12 th at the goal of the United Nations military operations in Katanga was merely to \"regain and ass ure our freedom of movement to restore law and order, and to insure that, for the future, UN force s and officials in Katanga are not subject to attac ks.\""},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Yet, just five days later, when Tshombe was calling for a cease-fire, Thant declared, \"For us to stop short of our objectives at the present stage would be a serious setback for the UN.\" 12 While the United Nations was pursuing its objective s, the forty-six civilian doctors of Elisabethville sent an electrifying telegram to President Kennedy, Pope John, and some fourteen other leading dignitaries around the world: SOS TO THE MORAL CONSCIENCE OF THE WORLD--stop-- IMPLORE YOU TO INTERVENE WITH ALL YOUR AUTHORITY TO STOP THE TE RRORIST BOMBARDMENT OF HOSPITALS AND CIVILIAN POPULATIONS B Y UNO. . . . ON OUR HONOUR AS PHYSICIANS WE DECLARE AS LIES THE DENIALS OF UNO SECRETARY-GENERAL--stop--INSIST UPON INQ UIRY HERE BY HIGH MAGISTRATES AND PRESIDENTS OF MEDICAL ORDERS O F ALL CIVILISED NATIONS--stop-- ONLY MEANS OF CONVINCING THE WORLD OF INCONCEIVABLE ACTIONS OF UNO ALAS DISHONORED--stop- - INSIST UPON CREATION INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNE COMPETENT JUDGE CRIMES AND M ISDEEDS UNO PERSONNEL WHO BENEFIT FROM IMMUNITY CONTRARY TO NATURAL LAW. 13 At the height of the sacking of Elisabethville, Tsh ombe personally appealed to the United States to use its influence to put an end to the destruction of the city. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson replied that \"the U.S. is very plea sed with the plans of the Secretary-General to brin g Katanga under control.\" 14 Secretary of State Dean Rusk explained to the unsu specting public that the U.S. was backing the UN action \"to save the Congo f rom the Communists.\" 15 And on December 13, twenty-seven U.S. Globemasters flew additional UN t roops, artillery and armored cars right into Elisabethville. 16 The next day Mr. Jules Cousin, administrative dire ctor for one of Katanga's largest mining companies, sent a bitter message to Presiden t Kennedy describing the United Nations' blind \"killing and wounding--even in the hospitals.\" He s tated that since the United States had continued to finance and support this carnage he was returning w ith disgust the Medal of Freedom awarded to him by the United States in 1946. 17 That same day, December 14, a full-page advertiseme nt was run in the New York Times protesting the bombing of Katanga, which had \"committed no agg ression except wanting to be free of a Communist-controlled central government.\" The State Department replied by accusing the sponsors of the ad of taking bribes from the Katanga Informa tion Service in New York. 18 Adlai Stevenson said further: \"The object of the United States in suppor ting the United Nations during this long and trying period has been to advance American policy in Afric a. . . . It seems to me that our policy and UN policy have coincided exactly in the Congo. I wish many Americans would think of that when they complain about what has been done there.\" 19 And so it went. The great and powerful United Natio ns--the \"last best hope for peace,\" the \"moral conscience of the world\"--pitted against tiny Katan ga, a country that would not give up. Again and again, Katanga held firm. Finally another cease-fir e was called. Almost a year went by while the United Nations went through the motions of conciliation and pondered its next move. Matters were complicated by the Congo war lasting longer and costing far more than expected. It put the United Nations into debt. A further financial complication arose when Soviet Russia refused to pay its share of the cost. This, of course, made it appear as if the Communists were really quite unhappy over the UN Co ngo policy. They knew full well, however, that their friends in Washington would put up enough \"di rty capitalist\" money to cover the whole operation. They were right, as was proved by subsequent events . The American taxpayer was simply told that the Cong o operation was anti-Communist while he was being relieved of several hundred million more doll ars. 20"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"On October 12, 1962, the American Committee for Aid to Katanga Freedom Fighters revealed a highly confidential memorandum which had been circu lated among top United Nations officials. The memorandum put forth a very precise and intricate t imetable for renewed military aggression against Katanga. It also predicted that the United States w ould go along with these plans in spite of rising public opposition at the grass roots. It declared: The U.S. will judge itself bound, as in the past, b y UN decisions and will supply the necessary transport aircraft and, later on, hel icopters. . . . Washington would like to work out a compromise; but the State Department has based its policy on the UN and will in no circumstances disregard its o bligations to the UN decision. United Nations officials and State Department spoke smen immediately charged that the memorandum was fictitious. Events since then, howev er, have proved that it was one hundred percent accurate, even to the timetable. Suddenly, the UN released a press report describing a letter said to have been signed by eight important tribal chiefs in Katanga. The letter bran ded Tshombe as a traitor, asked for his immediate arrest, demanded that troops be sent to crush Tshom be's resistance, and highly praised the United Nations. While most newsmen took the report at face value, Michael Padev of the daily Arizona Republic thought that the whole matter seemed too slick and decided to check further. As a result, it was revealed that the whole story was completely fa bricated by the United Nations. After giving assurances that the letter was authentic and promis ing to provide the press with photostatic copies, UN press officers later backed down and admitted th at they did not have the letter but that it had been seen. Finally, when word reached Katanga all b ut one of the chiefs who supposedly signed the letter telegraphed angry denials saying, \"Everythin g the UN published was a campaign of lies.\" One chief, Kasengo Nyembo, stated that he had been rece ntly approached by the UN to make an anti- Tshombe statement but had refused. The United Natio ns quietly dropped the issue. 21 Finally, on December 29, 1962, the United Nations d elivered its second annual Christmas present to Katanga. As Time magazine described it: The sound of Christmas in Katanga Province was the thunk of mortar shells and the rattle of machine-guns. . . . Blue- helmeted UN soldiers swarmed through Elisabethville, seized roadblocks on the highways. Swedish UN Saab jets swoo ped low over Katanga's airfield at Kolwezi, destroy ing four planes on the ground and setting oil tanks ablaze. . . . From Man hattan UN headquarters, orders were flashed to the 12,000 man UN force in K atanga: \"Take all necessary action in self-defense and to restore order.\" . . . Secretary- General U Thant says he is convinced that unless Tshombe is subdued soon , Premier Cyrille Adoula's Central Government in Leopoldville will collapse. 22 With a fresh supply of American money and military support Robert Gardner, the new UN chief officer in the Congo, confidently declared: \"We are not goi ng to make the mistake this time of stopping short. . . . This is going to be as decisive as we can mak e it.\" 23 One month later, after having captured control of E lisabethville, Kamina and Kipushi, the United Nations finally seized Kolwezi--a city of seventy t housand and Tshombe's last stronghold. An hour before UN troops entered the center of the city, Ts hombe made a dramatic farewell speech to his soldiers. About two thousand of them gathered in th e market square. Standing in a drizzling rain, Tshombe told his men: \"You have fought bravely agai nst the enemy three times in the past two and one-half years. The odds have become overwhelming a gainst you.\" 24 A few minutes later Katanga's independence was grou nd into the mud by United Nations boots.

This was in addition to the 100 million dollars worth of United Nations bonds that the United States purchased. The average voter did not realize that President Kennedy quietly used over 200 million dollars of his own personal \"slush fund\" (o fficially referred to as the President's \"foreign a id contingency fund\") to help the UN get out of the re d ink resulting from its military operation in the Congo. The UN, in turn, applied some of this money against the back dues and special assessments of several countries that were in arrears with paym ents.

Naturally the State Department emphatically denied that this had happened. Through the miracles of bookkeeping, they explained that the money was used only to pay the costs of th e Congo operation.

I do not know-- but SOMEONE knows . . . . Senator William E. Jenner, June 1956 CHAPTER SEVEN: BABY CARRIAGES Speaking before the Senate on February 23, 1954, Se nator William Jenner told the story of a young married man working in a baby-carriage factory in G ermany during, the early days of the Nazi regime. Since his wife was soon expecting their first child , the young man began to save his money to purchase one of the baby carriages he was helping t o build. But for some reason the Nazi government refused to let anybody buy them. So he d ecided to collect secretly the parts-one from each department-and do the assembly himself at home . Finally, when all the parts had been gathered, he and his wife began to put them togethe r. To their utter astonishment, they wound up with, not a baby carriage at all, but a machine gun ! And, as Senator Jenner observed: The pattern . . . was divided into se parate parts, each of them as innocent, safe and familiar looking as possible. The leaders did n ot intend to assemble the parts until they needed machine guns. But let's keep in m ind that when the parts of a design are carefully cut to exact size to fit ot her parts with a perfect fit in final assembly, the parts must be made according to a blu eprint drawn up in exact detail. This does not happen by chance. The men who make the blueprints know exactly what the final product is to be. They have planned the fi nal assembly years ahead. They do not think they are making baby carriages. 1 The United Nations operation in the Congo was no ac cident. When all the component parts are put together and viewed in their entirety, they mesh so neatly and consistently over a period of time as t o reveal a pattern far too obvious to ignore. Nor did this machine gun come into existence overnight. Actually the planners, who knew what the end produc t was to be, had been working feverishly for years. Their job was to get the individual pieces p roperly designed and then manufactured by as many unsuspecting souls as could be enticed to the assembly line. The baby carriages had been described to these workers with such appealing phra ses as \"peace,\" and \"security,\" world brotherhood,\" and \"international cooperation.\" But when the pieces were assembled in Katanga they brought death, destruction and Communism. The only people who were surprised at the final product were those who had taken the United Nations at face value and who had never closely examined either the blueprint or the planners who drafted it . The first rough sketches for this blueprint were dr awn up by Nikolai Lenin. They were expanded by Joseph Stalin and refined by Nikita Khrushchev. Sub tle changes and variations are still added from time to time, but the basic plan remains essentiall y the same. Stalin laid down five intermediate goals of Communi sm as necessary steps toward the ultimate goal of global conquest. Summarized, they are as follows : 1. Confuse, disorganize and destroy the forces of c apitalism around the world. 2. Bring all nations together into a single world s ystem of economy. 3.Force the advanced countries to pour prolonged fi nancial aid into the "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"underdeveloped countries. 4. Divide the world into regional groups as a trans itional stage to total world government. Populations will more readily abando n their national loyalties to a vague regional loyalty than they will for a world a uthority. Later, the regionals [such as the present NATO, SEATO, and the Organizat ion of American States] can be brought all the way into a single world dict atorship of the proletariat. 2 For those who may be puzzled at why the Communists are concerned over raising the level of underdeveloped countries, it should be noted that t his not only helps to \"bring all nations together i nto a single world system of economy,\" but also serves to bleed dry the capitalist countries that will be paying the bill. In addition there is the fact that underdeveloped countries are more difficult for th e Communists to take over than the more advanced ones . This will undoubtedly come as quite a shock to those who have been told that our massive giveaw ay program to foreign countries is keeping the Communists at bay. But, as Nikolai Lenin explained to his comrades: The more backward the country . . . the more diffic ult it is for her to pass from the old capitalist relations to socialist relations. To the tasks of destruction are added ne w, incredibly difficult tasks, vis. organizational tasks . . . the organization of accounting, of the control of large enterprises, th e transformation of the whole of the state economic mechanism into a single huge mac hine, into an economic organization th at will work in such a way as to enable hundreds of millions of people to be guided by a single plan. 3 In 1928 and again in 1936 the Communist Internation al formally presented a three-stage plan for achieving world government: 1. Socialize the economies of all nations. 2. Bring about regional unions of various groupings of these socialized nations. 3. Amalgamate all of these regional groupings into a final worldwide union of socialist states. The following is taken directly from the official 1 936 program of the Communist International: Dictatorship can be established only by a victory o f s ocialism in different countries or groups of countries, after which the p roletariat republics would unite on federal lines with those already in existence, a nd this system of federal unions would expand . . . at length forming the World Unio n of Socialist Soviet Republics. 4 The blueprint was further developed by William Z. F oster, national chairman of the Communist Party, U.S.A., from 1933 to 1957, when he wrote: A Communist world will be a unified, organized worl d. The economic system will be one great organization, based upon the principle of planning now dawning in the USSR. The American S oviet government will be an important section in th is world government. . . . Once the power of the bourgeoisie is broken interna tionally and its States destroyed, the world Soviet Union will develop towa rds a scientific administration of things, as Engels describes. There will be no place for the present narrow patriotism, the bigoted nationalist chauvinism that serves so well the Capitalist warmakers. 5 "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"By 1945 the blueprint was being drafted into its fi nal form. Delegates from countries all over the wor ld were preparing to participate in a conference at Sa n Francisco which was to mark the creation of something to be called the United Nations. Earl Bro wder, well known past leader of the United States Communist party, in his book Victory and After , stated: \"The American Communists worked energetically and tirelessly to lay the foundations for the United Nations, which we were sure would come into existence.\" The April 1945 issue of the C ommunist periodical Political Affairs explained to its readers the importance of getting the capitalis t countries committed to this international body. I t pointed out that since Russia would be one of the d ominant voices in the UN, it could be used to prevent other countries from acting independently a gainst Communism. The magazine stated: Victory means more than the military defeat of Nazi Germany. It means the collapse of anti- Soviet policies and programs as dominant tendencies within the capitalist sector of the world. It means that the p olicy predominant during the interwar years of attempting to solve the world cri sis at the expense of the Soviet Union is replaced by the policy of attempting to so lve the crisis through cooperation with the Soviet Union . 6 [Italics added.] Five months later the Communists printed a pamphlet entitled The United Nations which further explained what function they had in mind for the Un ited Nations. To be sure, it was not the function of \"peace\" that Americans anticipated. The pamphlet sa id: \"It [the San Francisco conference] met to outlaw war. But everyone knows that war cannot be a bolished until imperialism [i.e. capitalism] is abolished.\" It went on to explain that there were f our primary reasons why Communists should support the United Nations: 1. The veto will protect the USSR from the rest of the world. 2. The UN will frustrate an effective foreign polic y of the major capitalist countries. 3. The UN will be an extremely helpful instrument i n breaking up the coloni al territories of non-Communist countries. 4. The UN will eventually bring about the amalgamat ion of all nations into a single Soviet svstem. 7 In 1953 Colonel Jan Bukar, a former Czechoslovakian army intelligence officer, testified before the House Committee on Un-American Activities that a Ge neral Bondarenko delivered a lecture at the Frunze Military Academy in Moscow and declared: From the rostrum of the United Nations, we shall co nvince the colonial and semi- colonial people to liberate themselves and to sprea d the Communist theory over all the world. We recognize the UN as no authority ove r the Soviet Union, but the United Nations serves to deflect the capitalists an d warmongers in the Western World. 8 One final and extremely revealing glimpse of the bl ueprint was offered by Dr. Marek Stanislaw Korowicz, a member of the United Nations delegation from Communist Poland who defected in 1953 and sought political asylum in this country. Testif ying before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, Dr. Korowicz said: We were all indoctrinated strongly with the Russian master plan to reach the working masses of the various countries in the West ern World over the heads of their governments. . . . The organization of the UN is considered as one of the most important platforms for Soviet propaganda in t he world. I wish to underline the following comment: Not only Russia, but its sat ellites attach a primary importance that the members o f their bloc of satellite powers maintain their "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"relations with the Western World. It is emphasized at all times that, in the acts of real democracy, socialist democracy, they should se ek a direct channel over the heads of their governments to the great pop ular masses of the U.S. and the other western countries. The UN organization offers a parliamentary platform to the Soviet politicians, and from this platform, the y may preach to the populations of the entire world and do their subversive propaga nda. 9 It is no mere coincidence that the United Nations h eadquarters was located in the United States. Most Americans think that this was a victory for us in the cold war. Nothing could be further from the truth. Not only has this made it much easier for th e Communists in the United Nations to \"reach directly to the American masses\" with their propaga nda, but their spies and espionage agents posing as delegates and staff can gain entry into this cou ntry under full diplomatic immunity. Matt Cvetic, former undercover agent for the FBI, has testified that . . . representatives of the Soviet bloc government s in the UN do not only operate as propaganda ministers in the UN, but also, whenev er possible, carry on in this country to further the revolutionary aims of the Co mmunist International by working in close proximity with members of the Amer ican Communist party and alien Soviet agents. 10 In confirmation of Cvetic's testimony, J. Edgar Hoo ver, head of the FBI, stated that Communist diplomats assigned to the United Nations \"represent the backbone of Russian intelligence operations in this country.\" 11 A former employee of the Czechoslovakian consulate testified before a committee of the United States Senate in 1951 that UN officials from her co untry routinely took large amounts of baggage with them on their frequent trips home. She said that th is meant usually less than 30 large bags per person, but on at least one occasion to her knowled ge a returning UN official took 97 bags. She said that this baggage, which has diplomatic immunity an d cannot be inspected, contained electronic devices, \"equipment which was very secret,\" literat ure and secret communications. 12 It should not come as a surprise, therefore, to lea rn that it was the Soviet Union, not the United States, that insisted that UN headquarters be locat ed on our soil. Trygve Lie, the first secretary- general of the United Nations, revealed this fact i n his book In the Cause of Peace. Describing the debates over the future location of the permanent h eadquarters, Lie said: The Americans declared their neutrality as soon as the Preparatory Commission opened its deli beration. The Russians disappointed most Western Eu ropeans by coming out at once for a site in America. . . . Andrei Gromyko, of the USSR, had come out flatly fo r the United States. As to where in the United States, let the American Govern ment decide, he h ad blandly told his colleagues. Later, the Soviet Union modifi ed its stand to support the East Coast. 13 Let us now put these scattered pieces of the master plan together and see what it looks like in its entirety. Briefly summarized, the Communist bluepri nt for world conquest via the United Nations is as follows: 1. Consolidate total worki ng control of the United Nations into Communist han ds as rapidly as possible. 2. Use the United Nations to break up the colonial territories of non- Communist countries. 3. Use the United Nations as a vehicle for subversi on, espionage and "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"propaganda within the non-Communist member nations. 4. Induce the non- Communist member nations to abandon any strong independent foreign policy of their own by turning over this function to the United Nations. 5. Maneuver the non-Communist member nations into e stablishing s ocialism at home as the necessary transition stage to Communism and to become dependent economically on the overall international socialist control and direction of the UN. 6. Induce the stronger non- Communist member nations to transfer full control o f the ir military forces to the United Nations. After thi s, no resistance will be possible. The world will be Communist. Since the United States is, at the present time, th e only nation on earth that offers the potential of real resistance to the Communist plan of world conquest, the UN blueprint has been primarily designed for us. The Communists know that if they can just g et America to step completely into the cage the rest of the world will be theirs. And so, in practi cal terms, the master plan can be further simplifie d and condensed into just one simple objective: to ga in full working control of the UN and, at the same time, to entice the United States to gradually surr ender its sovereignty to this world government. With the blueprint clearly before them, the Communi sts next launched a massive propaganda campaign to sell the UN to the American people. The April 1945 issue of the Communist periodical Political Affairs set the pace with the following directive: The major question for us in connection with the San Francisco Conference is to assure the adherence of the United States to the Wo rld Security Organization, in the spirit of the policies formulated in the Crimea Declaration [at which time it was decided to form the UN]. We have come a long wa y along thi s path. But the final battle has not yet been won, although we are in an extremely favorable position to destroy the remaining bridgeheads of op position. In his address to the National Committee of the Communist Political Assoc iation in March 1945, Earl Br owder [head of the Communist party in the U.S.] sig nalized the struggle for complete national adherence to the Crimea policies as \"America's decisive battle.\" At the time of the Moscow Conference in Oc tober 1943, the Senate voted 85 to 5 in favor of United States participation in a World Security Organizat ion, even changing the phraseology of its resolution to accord with the Moscow Declaration. Only the diehard obstructionists voted against the resolution. . . . Building up vast popular support of the Crim ea policy would create the best atmosphere for the United Nations meeting and for routing the opposition. After the Charter is passed at San Francisco, it will hav e to be approved by two thirds of the Senate, and this action will establish a wei ghty preced ent for other treaties and agreements still to come. But the victory canno t be won in the Senate alone; it must emanate from the organized and broadening n ational support built up for the President's policy, on the eve of the San Franc isco gathering and af ter. . . . Great popular support and enthusiasm for the United Nations policies should be built up, well organized and fully articulate. But it is also necessary to do more than that. The opposition must be rendered so impot ent that it will be unable to ga ther any significant support in the Senate against the United Nations Charter and the treaties which will follow. 14 Elsewhere in the same issue of Political Affairs, the Communists received detailed instructions on how to capture this great popular support. It is necessary to show convincingly that, in criti cizing or directly opposing the "},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"decisions of Crimea, these elements are opposing no t only London and Moscow, but also, and in the first place, Washington-- our Nation's foreign policy; that they are jeopardizing and obstructing America's national interests. . . . In fact, around this sing le proposition, it is now possible to enlist the ac tive and coordinated support of every major organization and group in th e United States, ranging from national, state, and local governmental bodies, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Farm Bureau, and the American Legion, to the AFL, the CIO, and all other people's organizations. . . . This will be achieved if this vital battle is fought out in an uncompromising manner so as to reject all amendm ents and reservations, and if it is waged in behalf and on term s of America's national interests, as well as those of the common needs and the unity of action o f all of the United Nations. 15 That this campaign was overwhelmingly successful ha rdly needs mentioning. The opposition was, indeed, rendered so impotent that it was unable to gather any significant support in the Senate against the United Nations Charter. Americans, jubi lant at the idea of a peace organization which was in their national interest, unhesitatingly pledged their unlimited cooperation and support. By 1954, however, the United Nations began to lose some of its initial luster in American circles. A rising tide of opposition was clearly on the horizo n. Once again, the Communists went into high gear, this time to throw up a wall of protection around t heir pet creation. For instance, the July 1954 issu e of the Communist Daily Worker, in an article headed \"U.S. Labor and the UN,\" said: Both AFL and CIO have consistently given verbal sup port to the UN. Their conventions unfailingly adopted resolutions to this effect since the establishment of the world organization in 1945. Now the time has come when it is more than ever necessary to match the words with deeds. For t he UN is in danger of going the way of the old League of Nations. 16 A few months later, the same newspaper offered its Communist readers several tips on what arguments to use to overcome any criticism of the U nited Nations' dismal record. It answered the critics this way: So you see, its not the UN that merits your scorn a nd active opposition, but the policies that have undermined the UN and turned it into the opposite kind of an organization than was envisioned in San Francisco a nd provided in the Charter. 17 A further indication of the Communists' interest in maintaining the United Nations can be found in the Preamble to the constitution of the Communist party : The Communist party of the United States . . . figh ts uncompromisingly against . . . all forms of chauvinism. . . . It holds further t hat the true national interest of our country and the c ause of peace and progress require . . . the streng thening of the United Nations as a universal instrument of pea ce. This, then, is the \"baby carriage\" that has been so ld to the American people--sold, but not yet delivered. When the day comes that the planners fee l ready to assemble the parts on our soil, our innocence and good intentions will be of small comfort. The plan is both simple and brilliant. But have the Communists succeeded in conquering one third of the world through stupidity? Did they do it with br ute force? Was it luck? The answers to these questions are obvious. One thing for which the Comm unists must be given credit is that they are master strategists. They know full well that they c ould never hope to conquer the world through military might alone. But through trickery and dece ption, they have developed a formula whereby they can take over America, and thus the rest of the wor ld, without firing a single shot. Khrushchev has"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"said that when the Red flag flies over America, it will be Americans who will put it there. And in tha t simple boast lies the key to everything the Communi sts and their allies are trying to accomplish through the United Nations.

George Washington CHAPTER EIGHT: UNDER EVERY BED It is a sad commentary on contemporary America that when anyone tries to call attention to the fact that known Communists have succeeded in penetrating into key positions within our government, he is usually met with a barrage of wild accusations a nd condemnations from the anti-anti-Communists who now seem to dominate our opinion-molding channe ls of mass communications. Anyone who tries to arouse his fellow citizens to the terrible danger of allowing Communists and fellow travelers in high places runs the risk of becoming the object of public scorn. He will be labeled \"extremist,\" \"radical right,\" \"crackpot.\" He will be contemptuou sly dismissed with the observation, \"Oh, he sees a Communist under every bed.\" This phrase has almost become the national slogan of that great army of Americans who, being afraid to examine the evide nce closely lest they discover a truth too unpleasant to bear, loudly repeat over and over aga in, as though saying it made it so, \"It can't happen here; it can't happen here.\" As a former head of the U.S. Communist party, Willi am Z. Foster, put it: American imperialism is now strong. Its champions r idicule the idea of a revolution . . . they console themselves with the t hought that \"it could never happen in this country,\" and they scorn the at- present weak Communist party. But they overlook the detail that the same attitude was taken toward the pre- revolution Bolsheviki. 1 There is, of course, no law that offers us eternal immunity from a Communist take-over. It can and will happen here unless enough of us do something to pr event it. To act intelligently, however, we must first know how the enemy is operating and then appraise his progress and the strength of his present position. We have already studied his maste r strategy. Let us now examine the extent to which he has succeeded in carrying it out. Since a major Communist objective is to consolidate total working control of the United Nations, and since all else depends on that single accomplishmen t, we shall begin with that part of the record. The casual observer might conclude that the degree of Communist control over the United Nations can be measured by the number of votes they have fr om satellite countries. On this basis the Communists could only come up with about 12 out of the total of 113. The record shows, however, that a substantial number of countries classified a s neutral consistently vote with the Communist bloc . The Afro-Asian bloc, for instance (which now has ov er half the total number of votes in the entire organization), and much of the Latin American bloc almost never vote on the same side as the United States unless the United States happens to be votin g on the same side as the Soviets-as is often the case. Not all of these countries, of course, are un der the full control of Moscow; but they are, witho ut exception, fiercely socialist and anti-U.S. in thei r orientation. Many of them consist of little more than primitive areas of the world ruled by tribal chiefs and petty despots. Kenya, for instance, is now run by Jomo (\"Burning Spear\") Kenyatta, former leader of t he terrorist Mau Mau uprisings of the 1950's. Many nations in the United Nations are dictatorship s with hardly a pretense at representative Government. Few of them share values and traditions similar to ours. There is widespread contempt for the rich Yankee who thinks that his money can b uy friendship. And we should not deceive ourselves. Most of what apparent support we do get in the UN is the result of financial bribery, nothing more. Conor O'Brien inadvertently confirmed this when he wrote: Delegations from countries receiving aid from the U nited States would be warned in a friendly way that \"Congress might find i t hard to understand\" a given vote. "},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Such countries rarely allowed to their delegates th e luxury of an incomprehensible, and therefore potentially expensi ve voting position. 2 Shocking as this situation is, it should not be sur prising. After all, how does one go about enlisting the support of feudal princes, tribal chieftains, despo ts and cannibals? With moral suasion? The Soviets are perfectly content to let us spend ourselves sil ly buying the illusion of temporary leadership whil e they work behind the scenes consolidating their con trol of the UN. It is frightening to ponder what wi ll happen when Uncle Sam's money runs out. The voting delegates, however, are not nearly as im portant in the ultimate control of the United Nations as are the permanent staff members of the S ecretariat. The resolutions and edicts that are ground out by the General Assembly and the Security Council are, as we have seen, purposely vague to leave \"wide margins of latitude\" for imple mentation by the Secretary-General and members of the Secretariat. It is in the Secretariat that t he United Nations becomes the reality of world government. It is here among the faceless thousands of international bureaucrats that ultimate control resides. These men and women can effectivel y neutralize any resolution and prevent it from being realistically carried out; or they can put te eth into those that were never intended to bite. When Conor O'Brien was transferred from his positio n as a delegate from Ireland to the staff of the Secretariat, he was so impressed at the greater imp ortance of his new role that he was prompted to write: What pro duced the sense of shock was the growing impression that neither the General Assembly nor the Security Council had the f ull materials necessary for an adequately informed discussion and adequately mo tivated decisions, on the UN operation in the Congo. The only people who had these materials were the people who saw the actual telegrams-- the inner circle of the Secretariat. . . . As for the Congo Advisory Committee, \"advising\" the Se cretary- General on the basis of the information with which the Secretary-G ene ral saw fit to supply it, it seemed, in the light of the telegrams, much less li ke an advisory body than like a group of innocent outsiders being taken for a guide d tour. . . . . . . the Secretariat--rather than the half- paralysed Security Council or the amorphous General Assembly-- was the reality of the United Nations, the advancing edge of the sense of international commun ity. If the Secretariat played its cards remarkably close to its chest, as it now seemed that it was in the habit of doing, it was just ified in this, because it was tremendously importan t, for the hopes it represented, that it should win. Much of this was implicit in my attitude of mind . . . rather than fully thought out. What I was actually most conscious of was the more primitive feeli ng of pleasure at now being, as I thought, \"on the inside\" of this major international operation, combined with a sense of deflation, on realizing ho w very much \"on the outside\" one had been as an ordinary delegate in the corrido rs of the Assembly and at t he Advisory Committee. 3 What kind of person does it take to be a desirable member of this \"inner circle\"? First of all, like Conor O'Brien, he must have sufficient loyalty to t he United Nations that he is willing to place it we ll above any loyalty to his own native land. All membe rs of the United Nations Secretariat must take the following oath upon employment: I solemnly affirm to exercise in all loyalty, discr etion and conscience the functions entrusted to me as a member of the international se rvice of the United Nations, to discharge those functions and regulate my conduc t with the interes ts of the United Nations only in view, and not to seek or acc ept instructions in respect to the performance of my duties from any government or other authority external to "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"the organization. 4 Many of the American employees in the Secretariat w ho gladly took this loyalty oath to the UN refused to answer when questioned by a committee of the Senate regarding their Communist activities. Oath or no oath, any Communist who may be employed by the United Nations will never be loyal to anything except Communism. They will be lo yal to the UN only as long as the UN is serving the purposes of the Kremlin--not one minute longer. Of course everyone knows this, yet the non- Communists at the United Nations have learned that whenever this fact is brought up it enrages the Soviets. Consequently, they no longer discuss it le st it upset the cause of peace. This absurd ostrich complex has even gone so far that, while it is offi cially forbidden for the UN to hire anyone \"connect ed with fascism\" on the plausible basis that no one wa nts a potential Mussolini or Hitler to show up in t he Secretariat, it is perfectly all right to hire pers ons connected with Communism. Apparently no one is worried about harboring a potential Stalin. J. Edgar Hoover, director of the FBI, has disclosed that between 70 and 80 percent of the iron curtain diplomatic representatives in this country have \"so me type of espionage assignment.\" 5 Since it is only logical to assume that these people are dedicated C ommunists and that they will be exerting their maximum influence to channel the efforts of the Uni ted Nations toward Communist objectives, we will not waste a lot of time belaboring the point. There are sever al factors, however, that need to be emphasized. The first is that these people are not just run-of-the-mill international servants. They a re carefully screened and professionally trained in th e art of espionage. Once inside the United States their mission is to gather secret material and to s erve as a communications link between Moscow and American-based Communists. Hardly a month goes by without our reading in the n ewspaper of another United Nations delegate being nabbed by the FBI for espionage. It happens s o often that it is hardly newsworthy any longer. The frustrating part of it, however, and the second point to be emphasized, is that since these enemy agents are officially accredited to the United Nati ons, they can operate under complete diplomatic immunity. If the FBI catches them red-banded, all t hey have to do is flash their UN passes and they are free again. Our State Department usually dashes off a stiff note of protest to the Soviet delegati on asking that the individual be sent home, but a few days later, the exposed spy is replaced by another highly trained espionage agent from behind the iron curtain and the whole operation continues without missing a stroke. As U.S. News and World Report summarized it: Agents of Russia, Czechoslovakia and Poland, as emp loyees of a wo rld organization, face little or no surveillance of the type Americans face in Communist countries. They can talk to anyone. They can communicate with Moscow by secret radio code; they can travel back a nd forth between New York and their home capitals free ly, carrying secret documents with immunity. They are even free from arrest for minor crimes. And, if one is caught red- handed with secret U.S. documents, as was Velentin Gubitchev in the Judith Coplon case, he can count on merely being sent home, his passage pa id by the UN. 6 This diplomatic immunity makes it possible for UN C ommunists on our soil to go much further than acts of espionage. In fact, there is no limit to th e extent of their activities--even to the point of kidnapping, murder and terrorism. For instance, Ark ady Sobolev, who was at the time chief of the UN Soviet delegation, sent members of his staff to for cibly repatriate nine Soviet sailors who had sought sanctuary in America. The UN delegates who were mem bers of the Soviet secret police went into the homes of these seamen (in New York and New Jersey), beat them into submission, kidnapped them and sent them back to Russia. American law enforcem ent officials knew what was happening but were powerless to do anything about it because of t he diplomatic immunity of the UN personnel. 7 These same international servants later spirited aw ay two-year-old Tanya Romanov, a little girl born in America--legally an American citizen--whose pare nts were Soviet refugees. 8"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"In 1953 Dr. Marek Korowicz, a UN delegate from Comm unist Poland, took advantage of his presence in New York to escape to freedom in the United Stat es. This is much riskier than it sounds, for, as th e Chicago Tribune reported: The possibility that Communist secret police may tr y to shoot down Dr. Marek Korow icz, escaped Polish alternate representative to the UN, who has asked asylum in the U.S., has posed another problem for N ew York police, it was learned today. Their apprehension was dramatized by the fact that the FBI is standing 24-hour guard over Dr. Kor owicz, and the disclosure that at least 18 known agents of Russia or Red satellite nations car ry guns in this area. These agents . . . go about claiming diplomatic immunity, and police say they do not have the authority to disarm them. 9 But let us return to the main issue which is the de gree of Communist control over the United Nations itself. While these agents are actively engaged in espionage against the United States, they are also busy within the structure of the UN doing their par t to influence all that goes on there. They may be high-ranking administrative officials overseeing th e work of hundreds of employees, or they may be merely innocuous statisticians, researchers, or tra nslators. But regardless of their particular assignment, they are part of those unseen hands tha t can change a word here, interpret a report there, bury important statistics, delay progress on research projects, and in a hundred other ways paralyze the whole organization when it comes to a clear-cut issue involving real opposition to Communism. But, for the most part, these agents are not relegated to the lesser posts within the United Nations. They are smart enough to get themse lves into the key spots where they can exert maximum influence. For instance, for many years a M rs. Jugolova, a Russian Communist from the Soviet ministry of education, has been head of the secondary education department of UNESCO. 10 Many will recall that as recently as July 1963 two UN employees fled the country after being exposed by the FBI as secret officers of the Soviet militar y intelligence. One of these, Dmitrievich Egorov, w as a key personnel officer at the United Nations and w as involved in the critical task of hiring and plac ing other employees in the Secretariat. 11 Another Soviet official by the name of Permogorov was one of the chiefs of UN radio broacasts. 12 Mr. Katz-Suchy, a Communist from Poland, was presi dent of the Sixth Commission of jurists, one of the principal s tanding committees of the United Nations. (His only qualification for this post, by the way, in additio n to the fact that he was a Communist, was just one year of study of law at the University of Krakow.) 13 These are just samples picked at random to show tha t these people are not only present within the heart of the UN mechanism, but they are often place d in extremely important policy-making positions. One of the most important positions within the enti re United Nations--if not the most important--is that of undersecretary-general for political and securit y council affairs. Most Americans have never even heard of this position, much less anything about th e man who holds the job. The undersecretary- general for political and security council affairs has three main areas of responsibility. They are: 1. Control of all military and police functions of the United Nations peacekeeping forces. 2. Supervision of all disarmament moves on the part of member nations. 3. Control of all atomic energy ultimately entruste d to th e United Nations for peaceful and \"other\" purposes. In view of the fact that these three functions may soon constitute the ultimate power of life and deat h over every human being on the face of the earth, th ere would appear to be some minor justification for us to be more than passingly curious over who w ill wield this power. Since the United Nations was created in 1945 there have been eight men appointed to the position of undersecretary-general of political and security council affairs. They are:"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" 1. Arkady Sobolev--USSR (Resigned April 1949) 2. Konstantin Zinchenko--USSR (Resigned May 1953) 3.

In his book In the Cause of Peace Lie wrote: Mr. Vyshinsky [of the USSR] did not delay his appro ach. He was the first to inform me of an understanding which the Big Five ha d reached in London on the appointment of a Soviet national as assistant secre tary-general for poli tical and security council affairs. . . . Mr. Stettinius [U.S. secretary of state] confirmed to me that he had agreed with the Soviet delegation in the matter. . . . The preservation of international peace and securit y was the organization's highest respon sibility, and it was to entrusting the direction of the Secretariat department most concerned with this to a Soviet nat ional that the Americans had agreed. 16 NOTES 1.

Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard's Almanac CHAPTER NINE: THE HOME TEAM In 1950 the State Department issued a volume entitl ed Postwar Foreign Policy Preparation, 1939-45 . It described in detail the policies and documents l eading up to the creation of the United Nations and named the men who shaped these policies. This and s imilar official records reveal that the following men were key government figures in UN planning with in the U.S. State Department and Treasury Department: Alger Hiss, Harry Dexter White, Virgini us Frank Coe, Dean Acheson, Noel Field, Laurence Duggan, Henry Julian Wadleigh, John Carter Vincent, David Weintraub, Nathan Gregory Silvermaster, Harold Glasser, Victor Perlo, Irving Kaplan, Solomon Adler, Abraham George Silverman, William L. Ullman and William H. Taylor. With the single exception of Dean Acheson, all of these men have since been identified in sworn testi mony as secret Communist agents! It is truly fantastic, but here is the record: Alger Hiss: In 1950 Hiss was convicted and sent to prison for p erjury involving statements relating to his Communist activities. Since the second Hiss tri al evidence has continued to be amassed through other congressional investigations that is even mor e incriminating than that used for his conviction. As it was, the FBI had solid evidence of Hiss's Com munist activities as far back as 1939 and had even issued numerous security reports to the justic e Department and executive branch dealing with this fact. 1 In addition, a parade of former Communists testifi ed that they personally had known and worked with Alger Hiss as a fellow member of the pa rty. It is worth noting that Alger Hiss was very influen tial with the leaders of the Institute of Pacific Relations, which a Senate committee found to be inf iltrated at the top by Communists. Hiss was one of the trustees of the IPR and was very active in i ts affairs. 2 Mr. J. Anthony Panuch, who had been assigned the ta sk of supervising the security aspects of the transfer of large numbers of personnel from various war agencies to the State Department in the fall of 1945, testified that as a security officer he ha d access to conclusive information on Hiss's Communist activity; but when he tried to do somethi ng about it, it was he, not Hiss, who was dismissed. 3 In 1944 Hiss became acting director of the Office o f Special Political Affairs which had charge of all postwar planning, most of which directly involved t he creation of the United Nations; and in March 1945, in spite of all the FBI reports and other adv erse security information circulating among the top echelons of government, he was promoted to director of that office. It is more than a little ironic that Alger Hiss was the man who traveled with FDR to Yalta as his Stat e Department advisor. It was at the Yalta meeting tha t the decision was made to give the Soviets three votes in the General Assembly to one for the United States. Giving votes to the Russians for the Ukrainian SSR and Byelorussia SSR made as much sens e as giving extra votes to the United States for Texas and California. At any rate, even if Roos evelt had been inclined to protest this absurd agreement, he was up against the demands of Joe Sta lin and the advice of Alger Hiss. The Dumbarton Oaks Conference was held in 1944 to d etermine the future form that the United Nations would take. It was an extremely important m eeting since most of the really critical decisions were made there. This meeting was so hush-hush that the public and even the press were excluded from the proceedings. Alger Hiss was the executive secretary of this conference."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Hiss's role at the San Francisco conference, where the United Nations was finally taken off the drawing board and put on the assembly line, is bett er known to most Americans. He was the chief planner and executive of the entire affair. He orga nized the American delegation and was the acting secretary-general. Visitor passes bore his signatur e. According to the April 16, 1945, issue of Time magazine: The Secretary- General for the San Francisco Conference was named at Yalta but announced only last week-- la nky, Harvard trained Alger Hiss, one of the State Department's brighter young men. Alger Hiss w as one of the Harvard Law School students whose records earned them the favor of Professor (now justice) Felix Frankfurter and a year as secretary to the la te ju stice Oliver Wendell Holmes. He was drafted from a New York law firm by the New Deal in 1933, joined the State Department in 1936, accompanied Pr esident Roosevelt to Yalta. -At San Francisco, he and his Secretariat of 300 (mostly Americans) will have the d rudging, thankless clerk's job of copying, translat ing and publishing, running the thousands of paper- clip and pencil chores of an international meeting. But Alger Hiss will be an important figure there. As secretar y- general, managing the agenda, he will have a lot to say behind the scenes about who gets the breaks. 4 Hiss was not only the acting secretary-general at t he San Francisco conference, but also served on the steering and executive committees which were ch arged with the responsibility of actually writing the new Charter. 5 In such a position, he undoubted wielded a tremend ous amount of influence on the drafting of the Charter itself. He did not do it si ngle-handedly, however, as some critics of the Unit ed Nations have claimed. For instance, Andrei Gromyko was asked during a press conference in 1958 whether he considered it a violation of the Charter for a country to send its forces into the territor y of another. He replied: \"Believe me, I sit here as one who helped to draft the UN Charter, and I had a distinct part in drafting this part of the Charter with my own hands.\" 6 At the conclusion of the conference Alger Hiss pers onally carried the freshly written document back to Washington by plane for Senate ratification. The Charter traveled in a black water-tight box with a parachute. The master planners were taking no chanc es. Knowing that Alger Hiss was a Soviet agent, the FBI had prepared an extensive surveillance of his activities during the San Francisco conference. Sho rtly after Hiss learned of this through his contact s in the Justice Department, however, the FBI receive d orders from the top to cancel its plans. 7 An entire book could be written on the single subje ct of Alger Hiss and his influence over the United Nations during its formative phase. But, as importa nt as he was, he was only one man. Had Hiss never been born, or had he spent his entire life in a monastery, the UN would still be what it is toda y, for Hiss was not alone. Harry Dexter White: White was the assistant secretary of the United Sta tes Treasury Department under Henry Morgenthau. As such, he had complete co ntrol over our foreign policy dealing with treasury matters. The following Treasury Department directive indicates the influence that White bad: On and after this date [December 15, 1941], Mr. Har ry D. White, assistant to the secretary, will assume full responsibility for all matt ers with which the Treasury Department has to deal having a bearing on foreign relations. Mr. White will act as liaison between the Treasury Department and the State Department, will serve in the capacity of advisor to the secretary o n all treasury foreign affairs matters, and will assume responsibility for the man agement and operation of the stabilization fund without change in existing proce dures. Mr. White will report directly to the secretary. 8 Elizabeth Bentley testified that while she was a Co mmunist supervising the liaison between various espionage rings in Washington, Harry Dexter White w as a member of one of these groups. It was"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"known as the Silvermaster cell. She also revealed t hat White, acting on instructions from Moscow, pushed hard for what was later known as the Morgent hau plan and which was designed to destroy Germany's industry after the war so Germany could n ever again pose a serious obstacle to the Soviet plans for future expansion in Europe. 9 J. Edgar Hoover testified before a Senate investiga ting committee that \"from November 8, 1945, until June 24, 1946, seven communications went to the Whi te House bearing on espionage activities wherein Harry D. White's name was specifically ment ioned.\" 10 In spite of all this, White stayed on in his government post, as did Alger Hiss. White was e ven sent to the San Francisco conference to represent the Treasury Department. He served as cha irman of the important committee that established the United Nations multi-billion-dollar International Monetary Fund. Only a few months after being thoroughly exposed as a secret agent, W hite was appointed to the post of executive secretary of this International Monetary Fund which he helped create with large injections of United States tax money. When he turned in his resignation to the Treasury Department to accept this new position, President Truman sent him the following l etter: 11 Dear Mr. White: I accept with regret your resignation as assistant secretary of the Treasury. My regret is lessened, however, in the knowledge that you leave the treasury only to assume new duties for the government in the field o n inte rnational economics as the U.S. executive director of the International Mo netary Fund. In that position, you will be able to carry forward the work you so a bly began at Bretton Woods and you will have increased opportunity for the exe rcise of your wide kno wledge and expertness in a field that is of utmost importa nce to world peace and security. I am confident that in your new position you will add distinction to your already distinguished career with the Treasury. Very sincerely yours, (signed) Harry S. Truman Virginius Frank Coe: Coe was another American who moved from a high posi tion with the United States Government to accept a key post within the U nited Nations. He had been an assistant to Harry Dexter White in the Treasury Department and, as suc h, was the technical secretary at the Bretton Woods Conference. He, too, had been identified unde r oath by Elizabeth Bentley as a member of one of her Communist cells. When questioned about t hese activities, Coe found it necessary to invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid incriminating h imself. Consequently, Coe was appointed as the $20,000 a year secretary of the United Nations Inte rnational Monetary Fund, a post which he held for many years. He is now working as an economic expert for the Red Chinese government. 12 Dean Acheson: As mentioned earlier, Secretary of State Dean Aches on is the only one in this list of State Department and Treasury Department personnel active in UN planning who has not been identified as active with the Communist party. In t his connection, however, it is interesting to note the following facts. Early in his political career, Ach eson was praised by the Communist Daily Worker \"as one of the most forward looking men in the State De partment.\" 13 In November of 1945 he was one of the principal speakers at a Madison Square Garden r ally sponsored by the National Conference of Soviet-American Friendship. The other speakers were Corliss Lamont and Paul Robeson. 14 While undersecretary of state, Acheson promoted a loan of ninety million dollars to the Communist- controlled government of Poland. The loan was negot iated by Donald Hiss, Alger Hiss's brother. Donald Hiss was a member of Acheson's law firm. 15 When former Assistant Secretary of State Adolph Ber le, Jr., testified before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, he described Dean Acheson a s heading up a pro-Russian group in the State Department \"with Mr. (Alger) Hiss as his principal assistant.\" 16"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"In June of 1947, a Senate appropriations subcommitt ee addressed a confidential memorandum to George Marshall, the new secretary of state. This m emorandum read, in part, as follows: It becomes necessary, due to the gravity of the sit uation, to call your attention to a condition that developed and still flourishes in the State De partment under the administration of Dean Acheson. It is evident that there is a deliberate, calculated program being carried out, not only to protect Comm unist personnel in high places, but to reduce secu rity and intelligence protection to a nullity. On f ile in the department is a copy of a preliminary report of the FBI on Soviet espionage activities in the U.S. which involves a large numbe r of State Department employees, some in high official positions. . . . Voluminous files are on hand in the Department proving the connection of the State Department employees and officials with the Soviet espionage ring. 17 Marshall reacted to this information by doing exact ly what Acheson had done--nothing. Laurence Duggan : Duggan was head of the Latin American division of the State Department. Hede Massing, a former Soviet agent, identified Duggan a s a member of a spy ring under her direction. While his case was being investigated, he mysteriou sly fell from a window of his New York office and was killed. Noel Field: Field was a high official in the West European divi sion of the State Department and was a close friend of Duggan. When Field was also identif ied by Hede Massing as a secret Communist, he disappeared behind the iron curtain. Henry Julian Wadleigh : Wadleigh was in the trade agreements division of the State Department. During the Hiss trial he admitted that he had been working for a Soviet spy ring. John Carter Vincent : As chief of the Chinese affairs division of the S tate Department, Vincent was a member of the American delegation at the San Franci sco conference. He was also identified in sworn testimony as a member of the Communist party. David Weintraub: Weintraub, who was in the Office of Foreign Relief and Rehabilitation Operations, became the key figure in 1952 of a Senate investiga tion of Communist infiltration into the American quota of United Nations employees. As the Senate co mmittee stated in its report Interlocking Subversion in Government Departments: \"David Weintraub occupied a unique position in sett ing up the structure of Communist penetration of Governmen t agencies by individuals who have been identified by witnesses as underground agents of th e Communist party.\" 18 Nathan Gregory Silvermaster: As a high-ranking officer of the Treasury Departmen t, Silvermaster was also head of one of the secret Communist cells under Elizabeth Bentley's direction. Harold Glasser: Glasser also came from the Treasury Department wher e he succeeded Virginius Frank Coe as director of the division of monetary r esearch. Glasser was the Treasury spokesman on the affairs of United Nations Relief and Rehabilita tion Administration (UNRRA, the UN's first giveaway program of American money) and had a predo minant voice in determining which countries should receive aid and which should not. Elizabeth Bentley and Whittaker Chambers both revealed that Glasser was known to them as a Communist agent . Victor Perlo: Perlo was closely associated with Hiss in the Ware cell in the early days of the New Deal. He later became the head of his own Communist cell under the direction of Elizabeth Bentley. Irving Kaplan : Kaplan was appointed to the Treasury Department b y Virginius Frank Coe. Later, he became a high level official in the UN office of th e assistant secretary-general for economic affairs. When called to the witness stand to testify during the Senate investigation of the Institute of Pacifi c"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Relations, Kaplan sought refuge behind the Fifth Am endment 244 times. David Weintraub helped him get his UN job. William L. Ullman : A captain in the Air Force at the time, Ullman te stified that he had been borrowed by Harry Dexter White and taken as White's assistan t to both the Bretton Woods and San Francisco conferences. When asked whether or not he had ever been a Communist or a spy, Ullman claimed the Fifth Amendment to avoid self-incrimination. Lauchlin Currie: Currie was not included among the list of names at the beginning of this chapter because he was in neither the State nor the Treasur y departments. Nevertheless, as a personal assistant and advisor to President Roosevelt he pla yed a major role in helping to formulate United States policy leading to the creation of the United Nations. He was thoroughly exposed as a fellow traveler by both Elizabeth Bentley and Whittaker Ch ambers. The whole ugly story of these men and their actions can be found in the Senate report on the investigations of the IPR, the transcript of the Se nate hearings on Activities of United States Citizens Employed by the United Nations, and the report entitled Interlocking Subversion in Government Departments. 19 It adds up to a clear pattern of deliberate Commun ist penetration into key positions within our own government and the use of these posi tions to generate a Communist-inspired United States foreign policy. The major feature of this po licy has centered around getting the United States to gradually give up its independence to the author ity and control of the United Nations, which was created by the Communists for just this purpose. As security officer J. Anthony Panuch summarized it: It was World War II which gave the Soviet plan its impetus. During this period, a massive infiltration of sensitive agencies of the g overnment took place. Pro- Communist and personnel of subversive and r evolutionary tendencies were able to establish themselves in strategic slots . . . to shift the center of gravity in the process of U.S. foreign policy from a national to a n international orientation via the supra-national UN organization. Furthermore, if working control of the U.S. foreign policy were focalized in the UN organizatio n, the role of Congress in our foreign affairs could be bypassed. 20 Postwar foreign policy planning and the San Francis co conference of 1945 seem so far in the past that it is difficult for many to find a correlation between then and now. Yet events in Katanga were shaped as much by these now forgotten hands as they were by the O'Brien's and the Hammarskjold's of more recent memory. Needless to s ay, however, 1945 was just the beginning. When it came time to begin the actual hiring of the UN administrative staff, secre t American Communists were among the first in line. Trygve Lie, the United Nations' first secretary-gen eral, said that in the first year members of the Secretariat had to be recruited very rapidly; about three thousand were hired between March and December of 1946 and hundreds more were hired in 19 47. Lie was well aware of the possibility of their being secret Communists among the American jo b applicants, but this caused him little concern. As he put it: \"Nothing in the Charter or in the sta ff regulations bars a Communist from being a member of the UN Secretariat; nor could there be in an organization that embraces both Communist and non-Communist members.\" 21 This is, of course, one of the reasons why the Unit ed Nations can never work to promote freedom, justice or anything else the Communists wish to sup press. But that is another subject and one with which we shall deal at some length further along. F or now, the important point is that the immediate demand for thousands of people to fill out the Unit ed Nations' original staff provided a golden opportunity for the agents of Communism to get in o n the ground floor and to swarm into the key positions. The record shows that this is precisely what they did."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Since the new world-government organization needed men and women with skills and experience similar to those acquired in the service of nationa l government agencies, it was only natural that mos t of the original applicants were people who had been working for the United States Government in one capacity or another. It was natural, too, that these people should have the approval or recommendation of their former employer. There are two kinds of recommendations, however: official and unofficial. An official recommendation would na turally be entered into the record and might contain, among other things, a security check. An u nofficial recommendation would have no such drawbacks; a simple telephone call from an influent ial person in the State Department is all that would be required. It is not surprising that the State Department elec ted to follow what it called the \"no recommendation rule.\" The reason offered for this policy was that it would avoid making the U.S. look as if it overly influenced the selection of UN personnel. 22 According to the testimony of Carlisle Humelsine, deputy undersecretary of state, the \"no recommendation rul e\" was formulated in the department that was under the direction of Alger Hiss, and Hiss bad muc h to do with it. 23 Apologists for the United Nations have often attemp ted to deny or minimize Hiss's part in influencing the selection of employees for the initial United N ations staff. State Department officials have insis ted that most of these people were merely on loan from various branches of the U.S. Government. But the record is unmistakably clear and speaks for its elf. As the 1954 report of the SISS revealed, Alger Hiss was \"unofficially\" influential in the employme nt of 494 persons by the United Nations on its init ial staff. 24 During the Korean War, a New York grand jury accide ntally stumbled across evidence of Communist penetration into the American staff of the United N ations. One piece of evidence led to another and so alarmed the grand jury that it proceeded to cond uct a full-scale inquiry into the matter. The publicity attracted a great deal of attention and p rompted the Senate Committee on the Judiciary to initiate a parallel investigation of its own. Short ly after these investigations began, some two hundr ed Americans employed by the UN resigned, apparently t o avoid testifying. 25 Those that did testify, however, provided more than ample evidence for the grand jury to issue the following presentment: This jury must, as a duty to the people of the Unit ed States, advise the court that startling evidence has disclosed infiltration into the UN of an overwhelmingly large group of disloyal U.S. citizens, many of whom are closely associated with the international Communist movement. This group nu mbers scores of individ uals, most of whom have long records of federal emp loyment,, and at the same time have been connected with persons and orga nizations subversive to this country. Their positions at the time we subpoe naed them were ones of trust and responsibility in the UN Secretariat and in its specialized agencies. 26 The Senate investigations produced exactly the same conclusions. Senator Eastland, chairman of the committee, made the following statement at the conclusion of the hearings: I am appalled at the extensive evidence indicating that there is today in the UN among the American employees there, the greatest concentration of Communists that this Committee has ever encountered . Those American officials who have been called represent a substantial percen tage of the people who are representing us in the UN. . . . These people occup y high positions. They have very high salaries and almost all of these people h ave, in the past, been employees in the U.S. government in high and sensit ive positions. I believe that the evidence shows that the security officers of ou r government knew, or at least had reason to know, that these people have been Communists for m any years. In fact, some of these people have been the subject of charges before Congress before and during their employment with the UN. It is more than strange that such a condition existed in the govern ment of the U.S., and it is certainly more than strange that these people should be transferre d to the UN and charged to "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"the American quota. 27 [Italics added.] It takes the better part of a day to read through t he transcript of the hearings that led up to that conclusion, but for those who have the time, it is well worth the effort. There is no better way to ge t an accurate perspective on how the Communists have sec retly captured complete working control of the American staff positions within the United Nations. The following are just a few examples taken at random to give an idea of the scope of this control . Frank Carter Bancroft: Bancroft was editor of the documents control divisi on. A minister of the Episcopal church on the inactive list, he has a lon g, record of joining Communist fronts and sought refuge behind the Fifth Amendment when asked if he was a Communist. Ruth Crawford: A publications officer of the United Nations Intern ational Children's Economic Fund, Ruth Crawford admitted that she had been at one tim e a member of the Communist party and was still in sympathy with it. Abraham H. Feller: Feller was general counsel for the United Nations. When called before the New York grand jury which was investigating United States Communists in the U nited Nations, he avoided testifying by jumping to his death from a window of his apartment. He had been closely associated with Alger Hiss and other Soviet agents. Trygve Lie said that \"Feller was a victim of the witch bunt, of the awful pressure of the hysterical assault upon t he United Nations that reactionaries were promoting and using for their own ends.\" 28 Eleven months later, Lie dedicated the Abraham Fel ler memorial room in the UN library \"in memory of a loy al American.\" Joel Gordon: As chief of the trade analysis division, Cordon's s alary was $13,000. He had been with UNRAA. He invoked the Fifth Amendment to avoid self -incrimination when asked if he was a member of the Communist party. Irving P. Schiller: Schiller was scheduled to be the next registrar of the United Nations' European office in Geneva. When asked by an investigating co mmittee if be was presently (at the time of questioning) a member of the Communist party, he loudly proclaimed, \"No!\" But when the investigator asked him if he bad been a member of t he Communist party on the preceding day, Schiller invoked the Fifth Amendment. Alexander H. Svenchanski: A naturalized American citizen born in Russia, Sven chanski's job at the United Nations was information officer. He broadcas t news and other items to the Soviet Union. When asked if he was a Communist, he invoked the Fi fth Amendment to avoid incriminating himself. Alfred J. Van Tassel: As chief of the economics section , special projects division of the technical assistance administration, Van Tassel's salary was $12,840. He organized and coordinated UN training seminars and demonstration centers around the world. He invoked the Fifth Amendment to avoid self-incrimination when asked about membershi p in the Communist party. Eugene Wallach: Wallach was simultaneously a steno-type reporter at the UN and part of the New York security organization of the Communist party. David Zablodowsky: Zablodowsky was in charge of the publishing divisio n of the United Nations with a salary of $14,000. He admitted that he had transm itted secret messages between Whittaker Chambers and J. Peters knowing that they were both Communists. At one time he was president of a union which was later revealed to be Communist domi nated. He also had been editor of the publication put out by the League Against War and F ascism, a Communist united front organization. Herman Zap : Zap was a training officer in the technical assis tance administration and he coordinated government training programs all around the world. His specialty was economic development and social welfare. He also coordinated the exchange of persons between the United States and other countries. He invoked the Fifth Amendment."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Shortly after the results of these hearings were ma de known, Trygve Lie attempted to calm the waters of rising public concern by dismissing eleve n of the Fifth Amendment pleaders. The \"Red eleven,\" as they were called in the newspapers, app ealed the dismissal to the UN administrative tribunal which promptly declared that they must be either reinstated or be awarded substantial cash indemnities. As a result, seven of them were put ba ck into their jobs with full back pay, and the othe rs each received cash awards up to $40,000. (American taxpayers paid the lion's share, needless to say.) The UN administrative tribunal which reinstat ed and indemnified these security risks to America was composed completely of non-Americans. Seven nat ions were represented but at the time the U.S. was not even entitled to a voice in the decision. Shortly afterward, Senator Pat McCarran introduced legislation requiring that all American citizens seeking employment at the United Nations receive a security clearance from the attorney general's office. This was certainly a reasonable policy and one which most Americans assumed had been in operation all along. Nevertheless, Trygve Lie was a larmed at the suggestion and declared: \"To my dismay, the only precedent I could discover for suc h a law was the edict promulgated by fascist Italy in 1927. . . .\" 29 Washington was equally alarmed. Just two days afte r the McCarran bill was introduced, President Truman signed an executive or der stipulating that the United States would not undertake to instruct the Secretary-General as to A merican citizens he may not employ, nor would it penalize any citizens that he might employ contrary to the attorney general's judgment. 30 In other words, Hiss's \"no recommendation rule\" was to remai n unchanged. When the Eisenhower administration took over, there was a great deal of loud talk and breast-beating about cleaning out the Communists, not only from Wa shington, but from the United States staff at the United Nations as well. It was a fine campaign prom ise but turned out to be just as sincere as the proverbial two chickens in every pot. Professing to be anti-Communist is always good for votes. Since many Americans are perfectly willing to accep t a sincere face, a warm smile, and a little political oratory as a substitute for action, the p oliticians know that they will seldom be called upo n by their constituents to produce what they have promis ed. When he was seeking our votes Eisenhower promised to clear out the subversives. But he never did. The worst of the security risks stayed right where they were, or were promoted. Senator Joseph M cCarthy, who was actually trying to do what candidate Eisenhower promised he was going to do, received the full wrath of the ne w administration. Eisenhower even went so far as to issue an executiv e order which became the basis for what was later called the gag rule. This injected so much re d tape into the proceedings of congressional committees investigating Communist penetration into our government that it soon became quite impossible to obtain meaningful testimony. Conseque ntly, since 1954 there have been few attempts to investigate Communist penetration of the U.S. Go vernment. Apparently we are to assume that after Alger Hiss, Lauchlin Currie, Harry Dexter Whi te, etc., were exposed, the Communists suddenly lost interest in trying to infiltrate the United St ates Government! At any rate, part of this great pretense centered a round cleaning up the mess at the United Nations. Eisenhower set up a widely publicized international organizations employees loyalty board to hold hearings and review FBI reports on all United State s employees at the United Nations. As the first step, all Americans at the United Nations were inst ructed to fill out loyalty questionnaires. The publ ic once again relaxed with satisfaction that at last s omething was being done. The whole thing, of course, was a fraud. The net catch of the entire op eration was one woman clerk by the name of Eda Glaser. She was employed in the Security Council re ference library where she clipped articles out of newspapers. 31 Eisenhower's loyalty board gave clearance to people with blatant backgrounds of Communist activities and sympathies. For example, the board c leared Henry S. Block, director of the UN statistical division. Block's record was so bad tha t even the United States State Department had described him as a person \"believed to be Communist or under Communist discipline.\" 32 The most revealing clearance of all, however, was t hat of Ralph Bunche."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Ralph J. Bunche: As undersecretary-general of the United Nations and one of the three most influential men in that organization, Ralph Bunche may well be the best-known Negro in the entire world. Consequently, many people shy away from disc ussing his pro-Communist record for fear they will be branded as anti-Negro or racist. But the re cord speaks for itself. Bunche was on the editorial board of the openly Com munist magazine Science and Society for over four years. Even after the Communists themselves of ficially stated that Science and Society had as its function \"to help Marx-ward moving students and intellectuals to come closer to Marxism- Leninism; to bring Communist thought to academic ci rcles,\" Bunche continued to -write for the magazine. 33 In 1936 Bunche authored a pamphlet entitled A World View of Race which presented the Communist propaganda line so well that the October 1937 issue of the Communist declared: \"A fresh breeze is blowing through the classrooms of American colleges , carrying with it elements of Marxist and progressive thought. One of the -welcome fruits of the renaissance is a world-embracing study of race attitudes by Dr. Bunche, professor of politica l science at Howard University.\" In his pamphlet, Bunche wrote: \"And so class will s ome day supplant race in world affairs. Race war will then be merely a side-show to the gigantic cla ss war which will be waged in the big tent we call the world.\" 34 In 1943 Bunche went to the State Department where h e became associate chief of the division of dependent area affairs under Alger Hiss. He became, with Hiss, one of the leaders of the IPR which, according to a congressional investigating committe e, was \"considered by the American Communist party and by Soviet officials as an instrument of C ommunist policy, propaganda and military intelligence.\" 35 On August 19, 1948, after Hiss had been exposed as a Communist agent, Bunche sent him a letter in which he stated: \"I want you to know that I am in y our corner.\" 36 Bunche tried to line up employment in the State Dep artment for a Jack S. Harris. But Harris' pro- Communist background was so blatant that even the S tate Department had to turn him down. Bunche finally got Harris a job at the United Natio ns. Harris was one of those to whom the UN administrative tribunal awarded forty thousand doll ars indemnity after dismissal. One of the factors cited by the tribunal as justification for this awa rd was \"the fact that he joined the UN at the speci al request of Mr. Ralph Bunche.\" 37 In spite of all this Dwight D. Eisenhower, while pr esident of Columbia University, praised Ralph Bunche as \"the greatest statesman this country has produced.\" 38 The Eisenhower appointed loyalty review board, likewise, found no reason to question the loyalty of Ralph Bunche. He was routinely cleared along with a host of others with similar ba ckgrounds. On May 31, 1954, just three days after Bunche recei ved his security clearance, the Communist Daily Worker ran an article which boasted: The UN was getting ready to appoint Dr. Ralph J. Bu nche to a new high post when certain racist \"anti - Communist\" forces moved to stop this. . . . And so Dr. Bunche again had to solemnly prove his \"loyalty\"-- meaning that be had t o prove be is innocent of the \"crime\" of Marxism and is a r eliable supporter of the \"anti- Communist\" policy. The plans of the \"anti- Communists\" who could not stomach the idea of a Negro in a top UN post couldn't be ca rried through. The same enormous anti-r acist pressure which, in the U.S.A. and throughout the world, compelled the Supreme Court to declare segregated s chools and housing un- Constitutional, also blocked this scheme. But what was revealed again was the un-American machinery of the \"anti-Communist\" frame - up mill. Bunche, thanks to the new anti-racist upsurge, escaped. 39 "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Philip Jessup: Philip Jessup is the man who represents the United States as one of the eleven justices on the United Nations World Court. His pas t is studded with affiliations with groups official ly designated as Communist fronts. One of these, the I nstitute of Pacific Relations, has already been discussed. However, since Jessup was probably the m ost prominent and influential of all the leaders of this organization, it warrants recalling that th e Senate Internal Security Subcommittee found that: The IPR has been con sidered by the American Communists and by Soviet officials as an instrument of Communist policy, pro paganda and military intelligence. . . . A small core of officials and s taff members carried the main burden of IPR activities and directed its administr ati on and policies. Members of the small core of officials and staff members who c ontrolled the IPR were either Communists or pro-Communists. Jessup was chairman of the IPR American council fro m 1939 to 1940 and chairman of its Pacific council from 1939 to 1942. Both councils were high- level policy-making bodies. 40 Jessup, both in and out of the IPR, was closely ass ociated with Alger Hiss, Harry Dexter White, Frederick Vanderbilt Field and Lauchlin Currie. And , like Ralph Bunche, he came to the defense of Hiss as a character witness at Hiss's trial. When Frank Coe, secretary of the United Nations Int ernational Monetary Fund, testified before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee in 1952, be i nadvertently put Jessup in rather strange company. After readily answering questions about hi s associations with sundry individuals who had never been implicated in the Communist conspiracy, he suddenly found it necessary to invoke the Fifth Amendment when asked if he knew Philip Jessup . Jessup served as assistant secretary-general of the UNRRA conference in 1943 and the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944. He was a member of the Am erican delegation to the San Francisco conference in 1945. He was also the United States r epresentative on the fifteen-man United Nations committee of jurists that had drafted the World Cou rt statute. Continuing as a technical expert and advisor to various important UN commissions, Jessup prepared the State Department's infamous \"White Paper\" on China. Written at the very time wh en the Communists were overrunning the mainland of China, this report lavishly praised the Reds and condemned the anti-Communist Nationalist forces. Jessup later became one of the early advocates for the admission of Red China to the United Nations. President Truman was so impressed by this record th at he appointed Jessup as United States delegate to the United Nations in 1951. When the ap pointment came before the Senate, however, it was not approved because of Jessup's pro-Communist record. At the United Nations, Soviet delegate Vyshinsky reacted by praising Jessup during a meeti ng of the General Assembly’s political committee. Vyshinsky said he bad \"learned with dism ay\" the Senate's decision.\" 41 Equally dismayed, of course, was President Truman who proceeded to ci rcumvent the Senate action by assigning Jessup to the United Nations on an \"interim appoint ment.\" 42 Shortly after the Eisenhower administration came in on the promise of cleaning the United States security risks out of the United Nations, the State Department approved the appointment of Philip Jessup as our candidate for the UN World Court--an infinitely more important position than the one denied him by the Senate. This time, however, neith er Congress nor the Senate had any voice in the selection. Even though each country is allowed to nominate two of its own nationals and two from other countries, the United States elected to nominate th ree foreigners with Philip Jessup as the only American--making it very clear to all that he was t he man! In the final voting, Jessup was elected by an overw helming majority. With both the United States and the USSR voting for him, how could he miss?"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"NOTES 1.

Alighieri Dante, 1300 CHAPTER TEN: NEUTRALS AND NON-COMMUNISTS Anyone who doubts the potent, if intangible, force of the United Nations should consider the eagerness even of Communist regimes to join a club which is, and will continue to be, managed predominantly by its non-Communist members. 1 This statement by United Nations Ambassador Adlai S tevenson is a classic example of the technique of combining an observable fact with an absurd conc lusion. The eagerness of Communist regimes to join the United Nations is a fact that cannot be co ncealed. But since the obvious implications of this fact are not in accord with the image which the int ernationalists wish to present to the American people, we are told that (1) the Communists are eag er to join the United Nations because it is a \"potent, intangible force,\" and (2) the United Nati ons is, and will continue to be, managed by non- Communists. As for the potent-intangible-force argument, little needs to be said. Anyone who is familiar with even the bare rudiments of Communist strategy and tactic s knows that the Communists do not join or support an organization merely because it is a pote nt force. They join organizations either to destroy them or to take them over and use them for their ow n purposes; they support an organization only if it advances the cause of Communism. But how can this b e if the organization is, as Mr. Stevenson says, managed predominantly by its non-Communist me mbers? Part of the answer became painfully obvious during the investigation of United States \"non- Communist\" employees at the United Nations. The oth er part is the subject of this chapter. At the time of this writing, the United Nations has approximately six thousand employees in the Secretariat. About one fourth of these are classifi ed as professional, which means that they hold top supervisory and policy-making positions. These are filled according to the geographical origin of the member nations and in proportion to the various con tributions to the total UN budget. The United States, therefore, is entitled to approximately one third of the \"professional\" appointments. The two- thirds balance comes from other nations--Communist as well as non-Communist. Theoretically, the United States bars Communists fr om bolding government jobs. But as we have seen, this has been only a minor inconvenience to t he party faithful. For years, secret underground Communist agents have moved with ease throughout ou r entire governmental structure where they have been protected and promoted. The exposures of a few years ago were the result of congressional investigations which now have been, f or all practical purposes, completely discontinued. In France the Communist party is the biggest politi cal party in the entire country, and it holds the balance of power in the French Assembly. The French constitution even goes out of its way to make it illegal to discriminate against Communists in go vernment jobs. A Communist is head of the French atomic energy agency and was recently made advisor to the European center of nuclear research. 2 It would be absurd not to expect the Communists to be well represented among France's quota of employees and delegates at the United Nations. Italy is in almost the same position. At each elect ion for the past eight or nine years the Communists , posing as a legitimate political party, have gained a larger and larger vote at the polls to the point where today they hold the balance of political powe r in that country. Much of this power in Italy come s from the influential labor unions, the largest of w hich is completely Communist dominated."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"As the Wall Street Journal observed: The Italian government can't legally keep Communist s out of the Government. Further, the laws there provide that questionable c har acters have the same right to government jobs as anybody else, even if the job is a \"classified\" position. Also, there are no statutes the Library of Congress can find to protect military secrets. 3 Even Great Britain allows Communists to hold govern ment jobs so long as they are not classified as sensitive positions. The British do not consider Un ited Nations employment as sensitive. 4 A Senate subcommittee investigating this situation reported that certain UN delegates from foreign countries have been invited to Communist party head quarters in New York to lecture local party leaders. One of these was from the French delegatio n who gave a speech on the problems of the French Communist party in relation to the situation in Indochina. The other was from the Indian delegation who lectured on the problems faced by th e Communist party in India with the dissemination of propaganda. 5 Mr. Joseph Z. Kornfeder, a former Communist who tra ined in Moscow and who specialized in methods of Communist political warfare in this coun try, spoke before the Congress of Freedom in 1955 and told his audience: How many Communists, fellow travelers and sympathiz ers there are among the UN employees, no one seems to know, but judging by their number among the American personnel, there can be no doubt that the Communists control the UN and its staff association, and use it for all its w orth; which means that most of the special agencies at UN headquarters are, in fact, o perated by them and coordinated through the Communist cell in the UN st aff association. 6 The situation was summarized by the U.S. News and W orld Report in 1952 when it stated: U.S. authorities have no power to dig into the back grounds of UN employees from other nations, although they have information indicating heavy Communist infiltration among these employees. Some UN employe es who come from Great Britain, France, Mexico, Canada and other non- Communist countries are known or suspected Communists. . . . An informed estimate suggests that as many as one- half of the 1,350 administrative executives in the UN are either Communists or people who are willing to do what they want . 7 [Italics added.] Note that the date of this estimate was 1952. Commu nist influence within the governments of the world has greatly expanded during the intervening y ears. Since the United Nations was first launched in 1945 the secretary-general has traditionally been portrayed to the American people as the epitome of neutralism, the ideal non-Communist (as distinguished from an anti-Communist)--the truly im partial man. If the secretary-general had been portrayed as openly anti-American and pro-Communist , we Americans would have withdrawn our support long ago. Knowing this, the strategists dec ided from the very beginning to select men with obscure pasts; men who were not actual party member s but who were ideologically so compatible that they could be relied upon to carry the ball fo r the party. A brief look at the record will illust rate the wisdom of this strategy. Trygve Lie : Politically, Trygve Lie, the first United Nations secretary-general, was a dedicated socialist, a labor lawyer, and a high ranking membe r of the Social Democratic Labor party in Norway- an offshoot of the early Communist International. 8 According to Leon Trotsky, one of the founders of the worldwide Communist apparatus: \"The Norwegian W orkers' party had the reputation of being a radical party. . . . In the past, it belonged to th e Third [Communist] International.\""},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Trotsky further revealed that Trygve Lie was no str anger to the Communists in those early days. Lie had visited Moscow in 1921 and, as Trotsky put it, had been identified with the Comintern at that time. When Trotsky--the archenemy and rival of Stalin--wa s exiled in Norway, Trygve Lie was the minister of justice of that country. Acting in accordance wi th the wishes of Stalin, Lie confronted Trotsky wit h an ultimatum of choosing between either ceasing all criticism of the Communist regime in Moscow or going to jail. Trotsky continued to write exposes o f the ruthlessness of Stalin and his henchmen. Lie, consequently, had him thrown in prison and later de ported him to Mexico. 9 Commenting on the desirability of admitting Red Chi na to the UN, Lie revealed an almost unbelievable naivety about the nature of Communism when he wrote: Once before, the world had seen a Communist state-- the USSR-- isolated by the West after a successful revolution. I ha d always believed that this was a great mistake and that the West, instead, should have sou ght every means to fuller intercourse with Russia in the 1920's. Such a polic y might well have influenced the development of the Soviet state in a direction other than the one it took. 10 One of the first items on the agenda of the newly c reated United Nations was the election of the president of the General Assembly. At first the Uni ted States delegation considered nominating Lie for the position but later shifted its support to H enri Spaak, a Belgian socialist. What happened next is described by Lie: On the morning of the 10th-- the day on which the president of the assembly was to be elected-- Feodore T. Gousev, the Soviet ambassador in London , sought me out. His delegation, he said, had been informed by the Americans of my withdrawal; nevertheless t he USSR, together with its Eastern European associates, wanted to nominate me . . .. His delega tion had conferred with the United States delegation upon hearing of my withdra wal and, as a result of the meeting, the Americans had agreed to revert to thei r o riginal support of my candidacy. The Soviet Union would nominate me, he a dded, and the Americans would vote for me. . . . Mr. Gromyko strode to the rostrum and declared: \"Weighing the candidatures which have recently been mentioned in connection with the e lection of the president the Soviet delegation has come to the conclusion that the most appropriate candidature wo uld be that of the foreign minister of Norway, Mr. Trygve Lie.\" . . . Wincenty Rzymowski of Poland then rose in dutiful s upport of the nominat ion, and spoke of Norway and of me in generous terms. He was followed by Dimitri Manuilsky, the \"old Bolshevik\" from pre- Stalin days who was then foreign minister of the Ukrainian SSR. . . . Spaak won the election by just three votes, but, as Lie reminisced: \"There is no doubt that the result s of that election were felt long after, and clearly influenced the subsequent election of the secretary - general.\" 11 The post of secretary-general is infinitely more im portant than that of president of the assembly. So when the time came to fill this post, Washington an d Moscow once again moved in unison. Lie wrote: I recall something that Andrei Vyshinsky said in th e course of a conversation in London just before my election as Secretary- General. It was a most friendly talk in which Vyshinsky said that both the Soviet Union and the United States warmly "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"advocated my nomination, and that Mr. Bevin [of Gre at Britain] could be \"brought around.\" 12 As mentioned previously, Trygve Lie was outspoken i n his advocacy of the admission of Red China to the United Nations. He had even taken the initia tive in trying to drum up sufficient votes to make this possible. He further took the stand that Chian g Kai-shek should be ousted from Formosa. 13 It is no wonder, then, that the Communists were wel l pleased at having such a \"non-Communist\" at the head of the United Nations. But Americans were led to believe just the opposite. During, the Korean War, for instance, the Soviet delegation put on an impressive performance of pouting in public, supposedly over the way in which Lie was st anding firm against their aggression. It was corny acting but good enough to fool the American public- -which is all it was intended to do. How the Communists really felt about Trygve Lie is best rev ealed by Lie himself. When Lie first threatened to resign as secretary-general (be threatened to do so on several occasions), he went to discuss the matter with his good friend Gromyko. . . . I went to see Mr. Gromyko. . . . I announced the feeling that I should resign in p rotest at the American shift of position, and I hav e never found Ambassador Gromyko more friendly. His melancholy features fit up with sympathy. But he seemed half alarmed at my idea. \"Speaking for mysel f,\" he said, \"I hope you will not resign, and I advis e you against it. What good will it do? How will it change American policy? In any case, I would be grateful i f you would take no action before I have time to consult my government.\" Tuesday, Mr. Gromyko took me aside. He had cabled M oscow, he reported, an d Moscow's reply was \"No, definitely not!\" 14 Much later, at the height of the controversy over C ommunist penetration into the American quota at the United Nations, Trygve Lie finally did resign a nd was soon replaced by Dag Hammarskjold. Dag Hammarskjold : The rape of Katanga was primarily the result of h is planning and direction. Although portrayed to the American people as a grea t humanitarian, one need only recall his policy of deliberate deception, outright lying and utter disr egard for human suffering to fully appreciate the absurdity of such an image. In this regard Conor O' Brien unintentionally indicted himself, Hammarskjold, and the whole United Nations when he wrote: The greater the ambiguity in a Security Council dec ision, the wider was the Secretary- General's margin of interpretation. Through ambigui ties resolved, through margins skillfully used, the office of Secr etary- General had grown in stature and authority far beyond what the framers o f the Charter seem to have envisaged at San Francisco. This was quite widely r ecognized; someone, I know not who, had even jested that the motto of the Secr etary-General ought to be Per Ambigua ad Astra [ambiguity unlimited]. To most good \"United Nation s people,\" like myself, this growth seemed entirely healthy. . . . As for Mr. Hammarskjold himself, we had complete confidence in him as being -- I q uote the words used about him, in private, by a Russian member of the S ecretariat-- \"an integritous man.\" We even, I think, found something slightly in toxicating in the paradox of equivocation being used in the service of virtue, t he thought of a disintere sted Talleyrand, a Machiavelli of peace. 15 Aside from that, however, Hammarskjold was almost a political rubber stamp of Trygve Lie. He was an outspoken socialist, was openly sympathetic towa rd world Communism, and pushed hard for the admission of Red China to the United Nations. It wa s while Hammarskjold was in charge of UN affairs in the Swedish foreign office in 1951 that his government refused to support a mild UN resolution condemning Red China as an aggressor in Tibet."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The kind of people a man chooses for his closest as sistants and advisors is a good indication of the man himself. A glimpse at the Congo executive advis ory committee affords a fairly typical view. As we have seen, Conor O'Brien and Ralph Bunche held k ey positions in this committee. As for other members, O'Brien gave us an interesting insight whe n he wrote: \"Nobody said out loud, 'keep Communism out of Africa' . . . and indeed most peop le round that table would have been genuinely shocked, and for a moment even puzzled, if such lan guage had been used.\" 16 Shortly after the Hungarian uprising the United Nat ions sent a small team of investigators to Europe to interview as many of the refugees as possible in an attempt to document the tragedy. This was a far cry from the vigorous action they took against the anti-Communists in Katanga, but it was a nice gesture just the same which, while it did not help the Hungarian Freedom Fighters, was offered to the American people as evidence that the United Nations did do something . Active in this committee was Povle Bang-Jensen. Det ermined to do a conscientious job, he found that the only way he could get the refugees to test ify was to personally promise them that their names would not be disclosed to anyone else-especially an yone at the United Nations. Most of these people still had relatives inside Hun gary and they feared that if their identities were known their loved ones would be executed or impriso ned. This seemed fair enough, but not for Dag Hammarskjold. He insisted that Bang-Jensen turn ove r the list of names in spite of Bang-Jensen's promise to the refugees. Rather than break his word or endanger the lives of innocent people, Bang- Jensen burned the list on the roof of the United Na tions building. Hammarskjold was furious. Bang- Jensen was fired amidst a barrage of sweeping accus ations, including insanity. No UN tribunal demanded reinstatement or cash indemnification. To further complicate the situation, Bang-Jensen ha d been approached in confidence by a potential Soviet defector who pleaded with him to help arrang e for asylum in the United States. The defector told Bang-Jensen that the thirty-eighth floor of th e United Nations, where the top administrative offices are located, was actually under Communist c ontrol and that the Soviet secret police had successfully penetrated even the American intellige nce services. This shocking information was then dispatched to Allen Dulles, head of our Central Int elligence Agency, who, instead of moving resolutely to acquire the full details from this vi tal source of information, let Bang-Jensen and the Soviet defector cool their heels for seven long and agonizing months before even expressing any interest. By this time the defector had been sent b ack to Russia. The CIA never did ask Bang-Jensen for details. Shortly afterward, Bang-Jensen's body was found in a park in New York. Although it appeared to be a suicide, the surrounding evidence as presented by the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee strongly indicates that he was murdered by the Sovi et secret police for knowing too much. But the most interesting part of all is the fact th at several of the Hungarian refugees interviewed we re formerly officials of the Hungarian Communist party . When testifying, they specifically wanted assurances that their names would not be made known to the Secretary-General . 17 One can only wonder why. U Thant : One of the strongest political groups in Burma to day is the Anti-Fascist Peoples Freedom League, an organization that leans considerably to the left. U Thant was at one time the press and publicity director for this group. 18 But it was U Nu, then prime minister of Burma, who really brought Thant into politics. U Nu regarded U Thant as his p ersonal friend and advisor, made him his first secretary and also appointed him to the United Nati ons. In short, Thant was the protégé of U Nu. It is certain that Thant’s political beliefs and basic or ientation could not have strayed too far from those of his tutor without disrupting the close working rela tionship and mutual confidence so obviously shared by them for many years. What, then, is the politica l philosophy of U Nu? In a speech delivered on May Day, 1948, U Nu declar ed:"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" When I moved that the draft constitution of the Bur ma Union should be approved by the Constituent Assembly, I stated clearly that Burma was to be a leftist country. . . . In such a leftist country, the produ ction o f commodities is not for the purpose of profit. . . . Briefly, leftism is the po licy by which the world is being turned from the wrong path to the right path. . . . Lenin and Stalin, when building up Russia, did not use everything which the found i n the wr itings of Karl Marx. They adopted what was suitable for Russia. In [Red] China also leftist leaders adopted what was suitable for that country. Not ver y long ago when my friend Ko Ohn went to (Communist] Poland, he was advised by P olish leftists thus: \"We don't go wrong because others go wrong. We do what is suitable for Poland and we advise Burma to do what is suitable for Burma.\" See what Stalin did to build up Russia's own streng th. In 1939, in order to bring additional strength to Russia, he entered into a no n- aggression treaty even with Hitler. . . . When Trotsky was trying to bring abou t a world revolution, he accused Stalin and his followers, who were endeavoring to s trengthen Russia, of being traitors to the revolution. . . . If we now look ba ck to h istory, we find that Stalin followed the right path. 19 U Nu then went on to advocate the following program . Strengthen ties with Soviet Russia; confiscate all capitalist enterprises in Burma; abolish privat e ownership of land; form a league for the propagation of Marxist doctrine; and create a peopl es democratic army. Knowing what kind of political views were held by U Nu, we are now better able to appreciate the full impact of the following rather innocuous news item that appeared in the November 16, 1961, issue of the Burma Weekly Bulletin : Before Burma became independent soon after the S econd World War, U Thant entered the political field upon call by General Au ng San and U Nu. On September 1, 1947, he was made deputy director (pre ss), information department. As a public servant, U Thant earned rep utation and rapid promotion because of hi s ability, hard work, simpleness and good nature. U Thant was promoted as secretary in the same ministry before b ecoming the prime minister's secretary on January 1954. In the year 1952, U Than t went to the seventh session of the U General Assembly as a me mber of the Burmese delegation. Since then, he has traveled widely and generally in the company of Prime Minister U Nu as a trusted advisor and friend . 20 [Italics added.] In March of 1962 U Nu was ousted by General Ne Win. This was hardly an anti-Communist or anti- socialist coup. The new Government merely speeded u p the machinery which U Nu had set in motion. All commercial banks were taken over by the state, all private industry was declared illegal, and the entire economy was put under \"total state c ontrol.\" 21 After Thant was elected Secretary-General he immedi ately began to exercise his special brand of Burmese impartiality. One has almost grown accustom ed to the kind of headlines which appeared on the front page of the Chicago Tribune on December 3, 1962: \"Thant Asks U.S. To Meet Reds at UN: Chides West and Lauds Nikita.\" 22 Thant blasted the United States for resuming nucle ar testing: \"A manifestation of a very dangerous psychosis,\" he ca lled it. He said nothing about Russia's series of tests. 23 It was U Thant who tried to tone down the UN resol ution against the brutal Soviet suppression of Hungary. It was Thant who was so alarmed and dis turbed over United States sanctions against Communist Cuba and who proposed UN control posts in the Caribbean and in the United States to prevent an American invasion. 24 After UN troops had conducted themselves like barb arians in the Congo, it was U Thant who sent them these accolades of praise: \"Their loyalty to the United Nations, their team spirit and comradeship have been an insp iration to all those who value the peace-keeping role of the UN. . . . In truth I have every reason to be proud of their discipline and their conduct.\" 25"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Since U Thant is the present Secretary-General of t he United Nations and is very much involved in what that organization does, let us enter one more piece of evidence into the record--Thant's views expressed in his own words. Speaking in 1958 before the annual meeting of the American Academy of Political and Social Science in Philadelphia, he said: Let me be candid. When American foreign policy did concern it self with what was happening in the rest of the world, it did so out o f fear and suspicion-- fear of Communism and suspicion of Communist motives. Fear and suspicion are very undesirable states of mind. Th ey breed hatred, and hatred in turn breeds cruelty and intolerance. Fear of Soviet Communism has led t he United States, and those who follow her lead, to take a distorted view of the world situation and of the forces that are at work in modern society. . . . The U.S. policy toward China is unreal. It needs a thorough reexamination and reappraisal. . . . The refusal of the United States to support the admission of China to the United Nations is based on two assumpt ions-- that the Chinese government's behavio r unfits it for membership in the world organizatio n; that the Peiping government's grip on China may be broken at any moment. No one, however, believes this. . . . It can be argued, however, that though the Soviet U nion has not as yet attempted to impose its will on any state outside the Communist cordon, the Soviet has had and still has the intention to do so whenever the circumstances are favorable. But it is very difficult to arrive a t an objective appraisal of such suppositions. Suspicions are not proo f, and it is doubtful whether any. proof has been established to sustain this chargre. 26 If the above quotation does not speak for itself, t here is little that could be added here to make it any plainer. When the Soviet demand for a troika was defeated at the United Nations, it was hailed as a great victory for the West. But was it? Or was it another one of those apparent Soviet defeats which in reality was a strategic victory for them. In this c ase the Communists were demanding that the single position of secretary-general be replaced by a grou p of three men. U Thant held out for the status quo. The status quo was maintained but note the men that Thant appointed as his two principal assistants: G. P. Arkadev of the Soviet Union and R alph Bunche of the United States. In reality, the Soviets did obtain their troika . In fact, they were so pleased with the arrange th at, in spite of all their fiery oratory to create the public impression that they were not getting their way, they never even bothered to introduce a formal proposal for their t roika in either the Security Council or the General Assembly. It was all for propaganda value, nothing more. 27 These, then, are the non-Communists that Mr. Steven son says keep the United Nations out of Communist hands; the \"citizens of the world\" who pl ace loyalty to every nation above loyalty to their own native land; the neutral men who spend their li ves advocating Communist causes. Several years ago, Mr. Joseph Z. Kornfeder, a forme r member of the Communist party, summarized all that we have been trying to demonstrate in this section of the book. His words deserve serious consideration by all Americans: Now, as to the United Nations. If you were , let's say. a building engineer, and someone were to show you a set of blueprints about a certain building, you would know from those blueprints how that building was going to look. Organization \"blueprints\" can be read the same way. I need not be a membe r of the United Nations Secretariat to know that the UN \"blueprint\" is a Communist one. I was at the Moscow headquarters of the world Communist party for nearly three years and was acquainted with most of the top leaders, and, of course, I "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"was also a leadi ng party worker. I went to their colleges; I learne d their pattern of operations, and if I see that pattern in effect any where, I can recognize it. The UN idea was sold to us on the basis that a setu p of that sort was needed to keep the peace in this world . Nothing was said about the UN being a world Government in the making. I need waste no time abou t the UN peace- keeping qualities. With an aggressive Communist world empir e on the loose and sitting right inside the UN, that idea was definitely unrea listic in the first place; unrealistic and disastrous as many of the New Deal' s foreign policies. From the point of view of its master designers meet ing at Dumbarton Oaks and Bretton Woods, and which included such masterful ag ents as Alger Hiss, Harry Dexter Whit e, Lauchlin Currie, and others, the UN was, and is, not a failure. They and the Kremlin masterminds behind them never intended the UN as a peace- keeping organization. What they had in mind was a f ancy and colossal Trojan horse under the wings of which thei r smaller agencies could more effectively operate. And in that they succeeded, even beyond th eir expectations. . . . The United Nations is the sole great survivor, the grand monument, as it were, to the greatest folly of all time; namely, the illegit imate marriage between the New Deal and Communism. Its internal setup, Communist d esigned, is a pattern for sociological conquest; a pattern aimed to serve the purpose of Communist penetration of the West. It is ingenious and decept ive. 28 NOTES 1.

Adlai Stevenson, March 2, 1961 CHAPTER ELEVEN: ANIMAL FARM Some years ago George Orwell wrote a brilliant sati re on twentieth-century collectivism entitled Animal Farm . It is the story of a revolution staged by the ani mals on Farmer Jones's place. The animals considered themselves workers being exploit ed by non-productive humans--the capitalists. They reasoned that once the entire farm was turned over to the workers they would all live better and not have to work so hard. As with all revolutions, there were leaders and the re were followers--mostly the latter. On Animal Farm, the leadership was cheerfully provided by the pigs who hastened to point out that they were, through no fault of the others, a little smarter th an the rest. One of the first official acts of the new regime wa s to draft a statement of seven great principles which were then painted on the back wall of the bar n for all to see. These principles became the basis of the new order and were designed to protect the animals from any future injustice or infringement on their rights. There were such noble pronouncements as, \"No animal shall drink alcoholic beverages\"; \"No animal shall sleep in a b ed\"; and \"No animal shall kill another animal.\" But the greatest and wisest of all was the seventh grea t principle which read: \"All animals are equal.\" As the months slowly turned into years, however, th ings did not turn out quite the way the \"workers\" had expected. They were working twice as hard and e ating half as well as they had when they were \"exploited\" by Farmer Jones. The one significant ex ception, of course, was the ruling clique of pigs who were now living very well indeed. In fact they had moved right into Jones's house where they had been seen drinking Jones's ale and sleeping in Jones's bed! When the puzzled workers went to the rear of the barn to see if there was not someth ing in the seven great principles prohibiting this kind of conduct, they found that a few changes bad been made: \"No animal shall drink alcoholic beverages . . . to excess\"; \"No animal shall sleep in a bed . . . with sheets.\" Even the important sixth principle now read, \"No animal shall kill another a nimal . . . without cause.\" But by far the worst shock came when the poor creatures turned with hope to th e seventh and greatest of all the principles, which now declared, \"All animals are equal . . . but some animals are more equal than others\"! In this allegory, Orwell has exposed one of the uni versal devices of demagoguery--the use of high- sounding phrases to appeal to the noble aspirations of well-intentioned but unenlightened followers. I t has been used with success from the very beginning of recorded history. But the device has been expanded and refined during recent years to the poi nt where it is now perhaps the most important single item in the Communist bag of tricks. Without the appearance of being motivated by noble causes, the Communist conspiracy would have collaps ed long ago. For example, Article 4 of the Soviet constitution c alls for the abolition of \"exploitation of man by m an.\" Nothing is said about the exploitation of man by go vernment. Communism is generally thought to be based on the d octrine \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.\" However, Article 12 of the Soviet constitution says: Work in the USSR is a duty and a matter of honor fo r every able- bodied citizen in "},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"accordance with the principle: he who does not work , neither shall he eat. . . . From each according to his ability, to each accordi ng to his work . [Italics added.] Article 124 of the Soviet constitution speaks of fr eedom of religion; but Article 122 of the Soviet penal code makes it a crime to teach religion to small ch ildren. In other words, it is recognized that everyone has freedom of religion except as provided by law, and the Soviets have such a law. Article 103 of the Soviet constitution states: \"In all courts, cases are tried with the participation of peoples assessors [juries] except in cases specially provided for by law.\" Article 111 states: \"In all courts of the USSR, cases are heard in public unles s otherwise provided for by law. . . .\" [Italics added.] This \"except as provided by law\" gimmick is at the heart of practically all the high-sounding phrases which constitute UN declarations, covenants and con ventions. If we read these phrases rapidly, listening to them only with our emotions, we will f ind in them expressions of man's noblest aspirations. But if we read them with just half as much care as we would a sales contract, they will f all apart under the sheer weight of their own demagogue ry. For example, Article 14 of the United Nations Coven ant on Human Rights begins with the statement: \"Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expres sion.\" A little further along, however, we find: \". . . but it carries with it special duties and responsib ilities . . . and is, therefore, subject to certain penalties, liabilities and restrictions . . . as ar e provided by law. . . .\" Article 15, Section 3 says: \"Freedom to manifest on e's religion or beliefs may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law. . . .\" Article 19 promises liberty of opinion and then can cels it immediately by stating that it may be subje ct to certain unspecified restrictions \"as provided by law. . . .\" Article 20 states: \"The right of peaceful assembly shall be recognized. No restriction may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those impo sed in conformity with the law. . . .\" In fact, every single right outlined in the United Nations Covenant on Human Rights may be legally denied if in the opinion of the politicians it is \" necessary to protect national security, or public o rder, or public safety, or public health, or public morals, or the rights, freedoms or reputations of others.\" What better excuse could any tyrant hope for? Most wars and national crimes are committed in the name of one of these. In the Reign of Terror in France duri ng the 1789 revolution, unspeakable atrocities were perpetrated in the name of the committee of public safety. Hitler did the same in the name of national security. The United Nations followed suit in Katan ga in the name of restoring public order. \"No animal shall kill another animal . . . without cause\"! What a far cry this is from the American Constituti on which says that Congress shall pass no law abridging the people's right of free speech, religi on, peaceful assembly, and so forth. Not \"except as provided by law,\" but \" no law\"! What a difference this makes. According to Marxist doctrine, a human being is pri marily an economic creature. In other words, his material well-being is all important; his privacy a nd his freedom are strictly secondary consideration s. The United Nations Declaration of Human Rights clea rly reflects this philosophy in its emphasis on social security: food, clothing, housing, medical c are, unemployment compensation. In this connection, the UN declaration closely parallels th e Soviet constitution. The following comparison should be studied carefully: SOVIET CONSTITUTION UNITED NATIONS DECLARATION Article 118: Citizens of the USSR have the right Ar ticle 23: Everyone has the right to work."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"to work. Article 120: Citizens of the USSR have the right to maintenance in old age and also in case of sickness or disability. This right is insured by th e extensive development of social insurance of industrial, office and professional workers at stat e expense; free medical service for the working people; and the provision of a wide network of health resorts for the use of the working people. Article 25: Everyone has the right to . . . medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age, or other lack of livelihood. Article 119: Citizens of the USSR have the right to rest and leisure. Article 24: Everyone has the right to rest and leisure. Article 122: [Guarantees] State protection of the interests of mother and child, State aid to mothers of large families and to unmarried mothers, maternity leave with full pay, and the provision of a wide network of maternity homes, nurseries, and kindergartens. Article 25 (2): Motherhood and Childhood are entitled to special care and assistance. Article 126: Citizens of the USSR are guaranteed the right to unite in . . . trade unions. Article 23 (4): Everyone has the right to . . . joi n trade unions. Article 121: Citizens of the USSR have the right to education. Article 26: Everyone has the right to education. There are a great many other similarities between t he Soviet constitution and the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, but the foregoing comp arison is sufficient to reveal a common inspiration. The basic concept embodied in both of these documents is that the government has full responsibility for the welfare of the people and, i n order to discharge that responsibility, must assu me control of all their activities. How different this is from the traditional American concept of limite d government. It is significant that in actuality the Russian peo ple have few of the rights guaranteed to them in th eir constitution while the American people have them in abundance even though they are not guaranteed. The reason, of course, is that material gain and economic security cannot be guaranteed by any government. They are the reward of hard work and industrious production. Unless the people produce one loaf of bread for each citizen, the gov ernment cannot guarantee that each will have one loaf to eat. Constitutions can be written and laws can be passed, but unless the bread is produced, it can never be distributed. As Benjamin Franklin put it, \"An empty bag cannot stand upright.\" Why, then, do Americans bake more bread, manufactur e more shoes, and assemble more TV sets than Russians? They do so precisely because our gov ernment does not guarantee these things. If it did, there would be so many accompanying taxes, con trols, regulations and political manipulations that the productive genius that is America's would soon be reduced to the floundering level of waste and inefficiency now found behind the iron curtain. If Americans ever reach the point where the government is powerful enough to drive them all the y want, they will find that they also have a government powerful enough to take from them all th at they have. In 1801 Thomas Jefferson said: With all these blessings, what more is necessary to make us happy and a prosperous people? Still one thing more, fellow cit izens- a wise and frugal government which shall restrain men from injuring o ne another, shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of in dustry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. 1 "},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The principle behind this American philosophy can b e reduced to a rather simple formula: 1. Economic security for all is impossible without widespread abundance. 2. Abundance is impossible without industrious and efficient production. 3. Such production is impossible without energetic, willing and eager labor. 4. This is not possible without incentive. 5. Of all forms of incentive (fear, altruism and ma terial compensation) the most sustaining and productive for most people is materi al compensation. 6. This profit motive diminis hes as Government controls, regulations and taxes increase to deny the fruits of success to those who produce. 7. Therefore, any attempt to artificially create or redistribute economic security through governmental intervention can only result in eventuall y destroying the productive base of society, without which real secu rity for more than the ruling elite is quite impossible. On the surface, this may sound heartless and unmind ful of the needs of those less fortunate individuals who are found in any society. What abou t the lame, the sick and the destitute? is an often - voiced question. Every other country in the world h as confused real charity with the giving of other people's money, and has attempted to use the power of government to meet this need. Yet, in every one of these cases, the improvement has been margin al at best and has resulted in the long run in more misery, more poverty and certainly less freedo m than when government first stepped in. By comparison, America has traditionally followed Jeff erson's advice of relying on individual action and charity and of keeping the hand of government out o f such matters. The result is that the United States has fewer cases of genuine hardship per capi ta than any other country in the entire world or throughout all history. Even during the depression of the 1930’s, Americans ate and lived better than most people in other countries do today. In the United Nations concept, even those rights no t related to material things, such as freedom of religion and speech, are presumed to be granted by government. In America, government cannot grant rights for the simple reason that they are pr esumed to be God-given. The Declaration of Independence says that men are \"endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.\" [Italics added.] Our Bill of Rights does not pretend to gran t rights; it is merely a list of restrictions and limitations on government to make sure that no future government officials will ever viola te the God- given rights of each citizen. The United Nations De claration of Human Rights also refers to these as inalienable but the articles themselves clearly rev eal that such words are quite meaningless and serve only as window dressing. This is by no means an insignificant distinction. I f we accept the premise that human rights are granted by government, then we must be willing to a ccept the corollary that they properly can be denied by government. Few Americans would be willin g to accept this premise if they took the time to think it through. Yet, that is exactly the premise upon which the United Nations is building its world government and under which all Americans may someda y have to live. There is still another and even more important reas on why the distinction between God-given and government-given rights is important. It lies at th e very center of the present gigantic struggle between the forces of freedom and the forces of sla very. To overlook this factor is to miss the dominant meaning of the whole contest. Atheism is the basic tenet of Communism. If even the possibility of God is accepted, the entire superstructure of Co mmunist ideology crashes into a heap of contradictions and absurdities. Conversely, an a cknowledgment of dependence on God is the"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"basic tenet of Americanism (recent Supreme Court de cisions notwithstanding). As George Washington said in his farewell address in 1796: Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to po litical prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. . . . Let it s imply be asked, where is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments of inves tigation in courts of justice? And let us with caution indulge the supposition tha t morality can be maintained without religion. Wha tever may be conceded to the influence of refined e ducation on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experien ce both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principles. 2 It should be no comfort to Americans that the Unite d Nations has elected to adopt the Communist approach to this most basic issue. During the final United Nations debates on the Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, the representative from the N etherlands rose and said: I only want to stress one particular aspect which, to our great regret, has not obtained due recognition in this doc ument. I am referring to the origin of these rights. The fact that man's rights and freedoms are based on his Divine origin and immortal destiny, the fact that there is a Supr eme Being who is the fount of these rights, increase their value and importance. To ignore this relation would mean the same thing as breaking a plant from its ro ots, or building a house and forgetting its foundations. 3 It is to our everlasting shame that the United Stat es delegation remained silent on this matter. The Communist master planners have seen to it that nowhere in the Charter, in the covenants, in the declarations, or anywhere else does the United Nati ons grant even the slightest acknowledgment of God. To create an acceptable public image, the meet ings are opened each day, not with silent prayer, but with a \"minute of silence.\" The choice of terms is precise and deliberate. In the legislat ive chambers in Washington one can find a chapel for th e use of our elected representatives in seeking Divine guidance in their work. At United Nations he adquarters we find instead a huge statue of the mythological Greek god Zeus, who was known for his ferocity and cruelty. Rather than a chapel, there is a \"meditation\" room, the inside of which r esembles a nightmarish cross between an ancient pagan temple and a Picasso modern art exhibit. Comp letely devoid of religious symbols, there is only a lighted panel of bizarre geometric design, a few oriental benches, and a huge block of polished iron ore under a small shaft of light from the darkened ceiling. There are two ways of \"legally\" denying the rights of citizens: One is to write into the law certain escape clauses, prolific qualifications and vague t erminology, which can later be interpreted any way the politicians desire. The second way is far simpl er: The assumption is merely that rights do not exi st and no reference is made to them in the first place . The United Nations knows all about this second approach, as the following clearly reveals. Abraham Lincoln said: \"Property is the fruit of lab or; property is desirable; it is a positive good in the world. That some should be rich shows that others m ay become rich, and hence is just encouragement to industry and enterprise.\" The Communist Manifesto on the other hand, says: \"The theory of the Communists may be summed up in the si ngle sentence, 'abolition of private property.’\" It seems strange, then, that the Communist master p lanners should have allowed Article 17 of the UN Declaration of Human Rights to mention specifically the right to own property. Does it not seem likely that the Communists would delete this provision? Th e answer is that this is precisely what they have done."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Reference has been made to both the declaration and the covenants when talking about United Nations pronouncements on human rights. The declara tion is a broad outline of principle, a public statement of general good intentions. It has no oth er meaning. The covenants, on the other hand, correspond to legislation and would, if ratified by the member nations, become legally binding upon us. They would completely override and replace our own Bill of Rights. It is not surprising, therefore , to discover that there is often quite a substantial difference between the wording of the Declaration of Human Rights and the draft covenants on human right s. The sweet-sounding, vague terminology of the declaration has been replaced by far more preci se and enforceable language in the covenants. But in the case of the right to own property, the p rovision which appeared in the declaration, vanishe d altogether in the covenant! Dr. Charles Malik of Lebanon was the chairman of th e United Nations Human Rights Commission. Writing in the United Nations Bulletin of September 1, 1952, be said: I think a study of our proceedings will reveal the amendments we adopted to the old text under examination, responded, for the most part, more to Soviet than to western promptings. . . . The concept of property a nd its ownership is at the heart of the ideological conflict of the present day. It was not only the Communist representatives who riddled this concept with quest ions and doubts; a goodly portion of the non- Communist world had itself succumbed to these doubt s. A study of this particular debate will reveal the ext ent to which the non- Communist world has been communistically softened or frighten ed. He further stated that a \"quiet revolution\" had occ urred with the emphasis shifting \"with a vengeance\" from personal liberty to \"the adequate standard of living.\" It was nine years later, after this trend had gone even further, that United States Ambassador Adlai Stevenson said: The United Nations-- as an idea and as an instituti on-- is an extension of western ideas; of western belief in the worth and dignity o f the individual; of western ideology. It is based on a western parliamentary tr adition. Its roots are in the western ideal of representative government. When one stops to consider the philosophical foundation of the UN, it is easier to understand why Premier Khrushchev pounds the desk in frustration. 4 That sound you just heard was George Washington and Thomas Jefferson turning over in their graves. In 1948 the United Nations subcommittee on informat ion and of the press issued a proposed international convention supposedly to protect the right \"to seek, receive and impart\" information by word of mouth and by publication. It then proceeded to state that government has the- right to impose \"penalties, liabilities and restrictions\" as well a s the \"right of correction\" whenever it felt that n ews had been reported falsely. 5 More recently the Preamble of the United Nations C onvention on Freedom of Information was altered to contain this significant qualification: \". . . freedom of information and opinion accurate, objective and comprehensive.\" 6 [Italics added.] An excellent example of the kind of freedom of info rmation the world could expect under future United Nations management was provided at a meeting of \"ps ychiatrists and scientific authorities\" held under the auspices of the UN World Health Organizat ion (WHO) in November of 1957. This group discussed the \"deplorable\" free and public discussi on among scientists of questions which are controversial. They declared: \"The publicizing of d isagreements and contradictions among scientists, for example, about polio vaccine, or the cancer-pro ducing effects of tobacco\" has contributed to public mistrust of scientists and has caused scienc e to lose \"the infallibility with which it was cred ited in the nineteenth century.\" 7"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"What kind of information would United Nations offic ials decide is \"accurate, objective and comprehensive?\" Conor Cruise O'Brien gave us a hint when he wrote: . . . I referred [UN] headquarters to statements wh ich I had indeed made during the f ighting [in Katanga], but in the latter days of it, when it had already been impressed on me, by the telegrams from Leopoldville , that talk about ending the secession was frowned on. These statements were nat urally more guarded and nuancé than my first statements. . . . I also referred th em to an interview I had given Keith Kyle, for the BBC. Khiary [UN official], who was in Elisabethville at the time, asked whether it was an \"orthodox\" interv iew. . . . And smiled the smile of a man who knows that all offic ial versions are, have been from the beginning of time, and will forever be, worded to deceive the enemy and appease the clamor of the ignorant. 8 And, if there is any lingering doubt as to what the United Nations has in mind when it says it may impose \"penalties, liabilities and restrictions\" on the right to transmit information, ponder the foll owing news item that appeared in the New York Times during the United Nations December 1961 attack on Katanga: Asked why a UN jet attacked the post office in Elis abethville with rockets yesterday, General McKeown replied that the air str ike had been or dered because the building had been used to transmit anti -United Nations propaganda. If it were not so tragically serious, the following extracts taken from a recent issue of the United Nations Review would certainly be good for a laugh: A United Nation s Regional Human Rights Seminar was held in Canberr a from April 29 to May 13. Several speakers termed wire - tapping a \"dirty business,\" and the seminar agreed that it was a serious infringeme nt on human rights-- in particular, the right to privacy. Indiscriminate an d uncontrolled wire- tapping was unanimously condemned [apparently discriminate and controlled wire- tapping is not objectionable]. . . . Wire- tapping for criminal investigations should be permitted only by law, and only to combat particularly heino us crimes committed so clandestinely that such a practice was absolutel y necessary. . . . A majority at the seminar agreed that national comp ulsory fingerprinting of all citizens did not infringe any human rights. . . . T he seminar view was that human rights could not be violated when action was taken for the good of all. 9 [Italics added.] Since the United Nations claims that one of its pur poses is to put an end to aggression, it is interesting to note the United Nations' definition of aggression. At the fifth session of the General Assembly, in 1950, the International Law Commission inserted a paragraph into the draft code of offenses against the peace and security of mankind which declared the following as the UN definition of aggression: \"The employment by the authorities o f a state of armed force against another state, for any purpose other than national or collective self- defense or in pursuance of a decision or recommendation by a competent organ of the United N ations.\" 10 In other words, if it is a UN military action, such as in Katanga, it simply cannot be con sidered aggression! During the attempted Communist take-over of Greece in 1948, the Soviet satellites bordering on the north abducted approximately 25,000 Greek children. The children were never returned to their parents and they have since grown to adulthood, man y of them not even aware of their national oriain. 11 Yet a few years later, delegates from all over the world traveled to Communist Poland for a UN seminar on the rights of the child and, with the participation of representatives from Communist countries, they piously drafted the declaration of the rights of the child. Adopted by the General Assembly in 1960, the declaration provides that the child must be protected, not only from all forms o f"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"neglect, cruelty and exploitation, but also from pr actices which may foster \"religious or other forms of discrimination.\" This would authorize the United Na tions to dictate to parents everywhere, including America, how they may raise their own children. Aft er all, any parent who inculcates in his child a reverence for a particular religion is discriminati ng against all other religions. The only way to avo id religious discrimination in rearing children is to teach them none at all. And so it goes. The master planners and their unsus pecting helpers have been busy for years concocting poisonous pills with candy coating and o ffering them to the American public as the elixir for human suffering. They have covered every possib le sphere of man's activities. There is a genocide convention, a declaration of the rights of women, and even proposals for legislation to protect the rights of animals! And lest anyone take these \"great principles\" too seriously and make the fatal mistake of believing that they are any di fferent from the ones painted on the barn in Orwell 's Animal Farm, let them examine the record. The United Nations Charter says: \"Membership in the United Nations is open to other peace-loving states which accept the obligations contained in th e present Charter, and in the judgement of the organization, are able and willing to carry out the se obligations.\" Yet, the greatest peace-destroying force the world has ever seen sits in its tribunals and commands the unquestioning acceptance and respect of all other members. The Preamble to the Charter states: \"We the peoples of the United Nations, determined . . . to establish conditions under which justice and respec t for the applications arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintaine d. . . .\" But Russia continues to violate every agreement she enters into. When, in violation of on e such treaty, she builds a wall through the center of Berlin, denies access to the western sector, and murders in cold blood scores of civilians trying t o escape over the wall, the United Nations says nothi ng--nothing! In 1952 the free trade union committee of the AFL b rought to the attention of the UN the fact that the Communists in Red China had committed between fourteen- and twenty-million political murders. The United Nations listened but took no action. It was apparently too busy drafting the code of offenses against the peace and security of man to b e much concerned with twenty million murders. In 1953 the United Nations Economic and Social Coun cil was asked to discuss the rise of slave labor in the USSR. The council would not discuss the matt er and removed it from the agenda. When Red China conquered the independent nation of Tibet, se t about systematically destroying its race and its culture, and proceeded to murder over fifty thousan d Buddhists, the United Nations looked the other way. Years afterward it passed a vague resolution w hich started off by praising the principles of its own Charter and then called for \"respect for the fu ndamental human rights of the Tibetan people and for their distinctive cultural and religious life.\" The resolution did not even mention the name of th e aggressor! When Soviet tanks moved in to crush the Hungarian R evolution, the UN suddenly ceased its talk about \"self-determination,\" \"anti-colonialism\" and \"the peace and security of man.\" As a matter of fac t, throughout the blood bath, the Hungarian delegates from the Communist regime continued to attend United Nations meetings, to vote, and to enjoy all the respect and privileges of membership without one word of protest from the other countries. When the UN committee which had investigated the Communist suppression of freedom in Hungary finally submitted its report to the General Assembly, the United Nations was suddenly too busy to conside r it. When the item came up on the 1960 agenda, we find the following official explanation of what happened: \"The press of other business prevented the Assembly's consideration of the item on Hungary.\" 12 As the Wall Street Journal editorialized on September 19, 1960: \"Abdication of the UN's professed moral purpose is looming; it follows logically from the prevailing double standa rd at the UN which indicted the West for Suez and Lebanon, but was indifferent to the Communist rape of Tibet and Hungary.\" The United Nations has always loudly professed the right of self-determination as a basic right. The Charter proclaims \"respect for the principles of eq ual rights and self-determination.\" In 1955 the"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"social commission of UNESCO declared: \"All peoples and all nations shall have the right of self- determination--namely, the right freely to determin e their political, economic and cultural status.\" B ut when anti-Communist Katanga applied for some of tha t self-determination, the UN suddenly ran out-- or did it? At the very time that it was denying thi s right to Katanga, the United Nations admitted Communist-controlled Outer Mongolia to the ranks of peace-loving nations. It recognized Syria's independence and admitted it to the UN when it sece ded from the United Arab Republic. It did the same when Senegal broke away from the Mali Federati on; Pakistan from India; Sudan from Egypt. While the United Nations was insisting that the Con go could not function economically without Katanga, it cut up an area about one tenth the size of Katanga and created two whole new nations; the Kingdom of Ruanda and the Republic of Burundi. At the very time that the Security Council was cond emning Portugal for defending its citizens against Communist-inspired atrocities in Portuguese Angola, it refused to take any action whatsoever in a clear cut case of unprovoked aggression against Por tuguese Goa by pro-Communist Nehru of India. 13 All animals may be equal, but some are obviously m ore equal than others. The list is endless. The United Nations' actions sp eak so much louder than its words that one can only wonder in amazement at the number of otherwise observant Americans who have fallen for all its propagandizing about human rights. But the abov e item regarding Nehru suggests a good place to end this part of the story. The London Daily Telegraph a few years ago reported that a young recruit in India's army was asked during a written examinat ion to define \"fundamental rights.\" His answer? \"Big rules done by the great people like Lenin, Neh ru and Karl Marx.\" 14 NOTES 1 .

Smith of Wisconsin described the United Nations and UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cul tural Organization) as \"a permanent international snake pit where Godless Communism is given a daily forum for hate, recrimination, psychological warfare against freedom, and unrelenting moral aggr ession against peace.\" 1 That same year, at its annual national convention i n Miami, the American Legion formally passed the following resolution: Resolved, that the America n Legion urges Congress to repeal the law creating the United States Commission for UNESCO and its Sec retariat; and that Congress deliver mandates to all administrative dep artments of the United States Government to desist from further dissemination of UNE SCO and U.S. Commission for UNESCO materials, reports and progra ms within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. As the true nature of UNESCO became better understo od by more and more Americans, popular opposition began to rise against it. Patriotic orga nizations and service clubs all over the nation beg an to speak up and demand corrective action. To stem t he tide, the State Department issued a series of lengthy bulletins which asserted that a few people had been \"making some misstatements about UNESCO, some of them attaining the proportions of d eliberate misrepresentation. Many of these statements repeat irresponsible charges which were long ago shown to be groundless.\" 2 And, a few days after the American Legion passed its resolutio n condemning UNESCO, President Truman told newspaper reporters: \"The Legion doesn't know what it is talking about. They have gone haywire in the last few years. They don't know what they are d oing.\" 3 The purpose of this chapter is to examine some of t he \"groundless, irresponsible charges and misrepresentations\" that have led the American Legi on, the Daughters of the American Revolution and many other patriotic societies to go \"haywire\" against UNESCO. Friedrich Engels wrote that under Communism the you th of the world \"will grow up in new, free social conditions and will be in a position to cast away a ll this rubbish of state-ism.\" 4 William Z. Foster amplified this by stating: The studies will be revolutionized, being cleansed of religious, patriotic and other features of the bourge ois ideology. The students will be taught on the ba sis of Marxian dialectical materialism, internationalism, and the general ethics of the new Socialist society. . . . Our teachers must write new school textbooks, and r ewrite history from the Marxian point of view. . . . There will be no place for the present narrow patri otism, the bigoted nationalist chauvinism that serves so well the capitalist warma kers. 5 And in 1936, speaking before the ninth national con vention of the Communist party in the United States, Earl Browder declared: \"Who wins the youth, wins the future of America.\" 6"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"In these three brief statements, the Communists the mselves have fully explained what UNESCO in America was designed to accomplish: 1. Achieve effective control of the educational sys tem of our country. If the Communists can condition the minds of the youth of a nation for just one generation, that nation will be theirs within that generation. 2. Deride, ridicule and ultimately destroy any feelings of pa triotism or loyalty to our country among the youth. 3. Instill in our youth an outlook of so-called internationalism and world- mindedness. This can easily be reconciled at a late r date with the concept of a one-world Communist empire. 4. Indoctrinate the youth to embrace Marxian social ism (not under that name, of course) as the correct political and social viewpoi nt. 5. Neutralize the youth against the religious influ ences of the home and all other concepts of rigid morality which might interfere with the a cceptance of Marxian and Communist doctrine. As former Communist Joseph Z. Kornfeder expressed i t: \"UNESCO corresponds to the agitation and propaganda department in the Communist party. This department handles the strategy and method of getting at the public mind, young and old.\" 7 The Senate Internal Security Subcommittee disclosed that Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White were the principal architects of UNESCO along with Commu nists from other countries. For instance, Elen Wilkenson who had been an open Communist in England , was even elected to a city council position on the Communist party ticket, and who later called herself a socialist, was made president of UNESCO's preparatory commission. Clement Attlee had made her British minister of education. 8 And, as the Senate Committee on the judiciary state d: What appears . . . to be by far the worst danger sp ot, from the standpoint of d isloyalty and subversive activity among Americans e mployed by international organizations is UNESCO. . . Mr. Pierce Gerety, for mer chairman of the international organizations employees loyalty board . . . expressed the opinion that there existed in UNESCO a clique of people who placed the interests of the Communists and Communist ideology above any service to UNESCO, and above their own country. 9 On August 2, 1953, Dr. Luther Evans, who was then t he new director of UNESCO, inadvertently confirmed the above Senate report when he declared \"that the U.S. drive against Communist infiltration in UN groups was a factor threatening to destroy UNESCO.\" 10 [Italics added.] The following item appeared in newspapers on Septem ber 25, 1954. The article is speaking about the Institute of Pacific Relations, which, as previ ously mentioned, has been officially described as Soviet dominated. The news dispatch said: \"Two prob lems confront the organization. One is that the work it set out to do is now being duplicated by we althier and better equipped world organizations such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).\" 11 In its own literature and periodicals, UNESCO makes its position clear. The Communist Guardian of Melbourne, England, in its May 28, 1959, issue, rec ommended the UNESCO Courier to its readers as \"a monthly magazine deserving of wide distributi on.\" 12 The Courier is so blatant in its Communist propaganda that even the most unobserving reader ca n scarcely miss it."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"As we have pointed out several times, not all of th e people who are advancing the cause of the United Nations and its specialized agencies are doi ng so with malice aforethought. As a matter of fact there are relatively few who are. It has always bee n the pattern of successful Communist operation to have unsuspecting idealists do most of the work whi le the Communists stay in the background pulling the strings and issuing the directives. Consequentl y, many good people are victimized into lending their time, their reputations and their money. Unfo rtunately once a person has done this he gradually acquires a vested interest in his own error and eve n though he finds more and more aspects of the United Nations which run counter to his sensibiliti es, he tends to brush them aside rather than swallow his pride and admit that he made an origina l mistake in judgment. Most humans are like that, but occasionally there is an exception. Mr. John M. Larson, as an active, respected and wel l-known citizen in his community, had been invited by the State Department to become a member of the United States National Commission for UNESCO. Like most Americans, he considered this to be an honor and felt that it was his duty to accept, which be did. He soon discovered, however, that he had been invited solely for the prestige that his name would add to the commission. He was e xpected to be satisfied with the role of a yes- man for all the decisions of the full-time staff an d senior members of the commission. He expressed a desire to participate in UNESCO planning sessions a s he was theoretically allowed to do¾ volunteering to travel at his own expense. But he w as not advised of the meetings. He tried to make his voice felt through correspondence and personal visits with the commission secretariat. He was ignored as were his recommendations. Finally he res igned in protest. Here is what Mr. Larson revealed: With respect to UNESCO's literature, it has very li ttle substance, and what little it does have, appears overtly or covertly to be slante d away from the spiritual and political beliefs and traditions of the United Stat es of America toward the ster ile conceptions of a nebulous one- world government or federation which is to be built upon atheistic foundations. . . . I found gra ve errors of omission and distortions of perspective with respect to historic al trends and events and to the growth and devel opment of certain ideas. For these reasons, it is i mportant to analyze what UNESCO does not present and proclaim a s well as what it does present and proclaim, in order to gain an understan ding of what its aims are. . . . Peoples today are interested in ach ieving some sort of peaceful solution to the conflicts present in the world. The question is: on what foundation will the edifice of peace be built? UNESCO claims to supply this fou ndation, but when its claims are investigated, they are found to be empty a s well as a convenient cover for its real activities. The foundations of UNESCO are athe istic and materialistic. For it, man is the highest product of nature rather than on e created in the image and likeness of God. This view of God and man dictates UNESCO 's methods and. can be seen in them. Rather than being genuinely co ncerned with, the intellectual and moral development of men through e ducation, UNESCO makes cynical use of those whom it professes to be servin g and helping; rather than assisting people to grow and accept responsibilities, UNESCO preys upo n those with whom it comes in contact and is more than glad to assume covertly or overtly all responsibilitv. 13 Look at a few examples. The book How the United Nations Works by Tom Galt is one of the children's books recommended by UNESCO. 14 It also comes highly praised by the New York Times , the Saturday Review of Literature and the New York Herald Tribune as well as the United Nations Information Service. In the opening paragraphs the reader is informed that the United Nations is \"the most important organization that has ever been crea ted on this earth.\" As for accuracy of information in this book, the following is typical. The author describes the UN organizational meeting in San Francisco in 1945. On page 20 he says that while th e delegates were meeting in the opera house, Japanese bombs drifted overhead on balloons and exp loded in the hills near the city! On page 9, the author skillfully plants a typical UNESCO attitude in the minds of his young readers by saving that when he was a boy his teachers and school books tol d him:"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" The U.S. is always good and noble. We never fought a war except in self- defense. We have always been kind and generous to other countries. But the people of other countries are dishonest and mean. T hey will always cheat you. They never take baths. You and the United Nations is another children's book highly recommended and p raised by UNESCO. 15 Written and illustrated by Lois Fisher, it is desi gned for the very young. It is crammed with clever drawings and appropriate captions to ca tch the imagination of children too young to understand the more complicated and sophisticated U nited Nations arguments. For instance, all pro- UN figures are characterized as wholesome and intel ligent. Those who are against the UN are presented as ridiculous and evil. One classic illus tration depicts our Founding Fathers as three extremely ugly and grotesque cross-eyed creatures s narling at each other while a rat watches from the floor. This is the kind of conditioning of children's atti tudes that Luther Evans had in mind when he addressed a UNESCO meeting and said: UNESCO's is a radical program. The rewards may be v isible ten years from now; again they may not be visible for a hundred years. . . . They are instil led into the daily habits of mind of rising generations- perhaps not the first, not the second, but ultimately, it must be so. . . . To make the sy stem of the UN and its specialized agencies work, we must sweep past tradi tional barriers in our thinking toward new frames of reference. 16 Writing as one of UNESCO's special consultants in a symposium on human rights, Borris Tchechko provides us with an example of just what these new frames of reference might be. He explained that the Soviet constitution \"not only constitutes one o f the most decisive stages in the advance of the ideas of the democratic emancipation of man, but al so-and this is of vital importance-sets man as a worker in ideal political, social and economic cond itions and gives him facilities for work and intellectual life.\" 17 On February 14, 1963, American newspapers carried a UPI report from Paris revealing that UNESCO had just published a booklet entitled Equality of Rights Between Races and Nationalities in the USSR. The book is pure Soviet propaganda denouncing race discrimination in the United States while praising Soviet race relations as one of the major social triumphs of the twentieth century: Only the revolu tion of October 1917 which . . . instituted the Sov iet system, enabled the peoples of Russia to achieve genuine eq uality of rights and freedom of development. . . . It was the Communist party wh ich showed the peoples of Russia the true way to free themselv es from social and national oppression. . . . The Soviet Union is a brotherhood of free and equal peoples comprising 15 sovereign Soviet republics in voluntary association on a footing of complete equality. Under the constitution of the USSR, each of these republics retains the right to secede from the union. Each of them embodi es the collective will of its people and can decide its own future in entire free dom. 18 Through our membership in the United Nations, the A merican people were required to pay for over a third of the total cost of publishing this booklet and giving it worldwide distribution¾ a great deal more than the Soviet Union paid. As previously noted, William Z. Foster, who was at the time the head of the Communist party in the United States, predicted that in the future Communi st world \"there will be no place for the present narrow patriotism, the bigoted nationalist chauvini sm that serves so well the capitalist warmakers.\" And in the constitution of the United States Commun ist party, we find the same sentiment: \"The Communist party . . . fights uncompromisingly again st . . . all forms of chauvinism.\" With this in min d,"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"it is doubly interesting to note the following pass ages taken from a UNESCO publication entitled Toward World Understanding: We shall come to nationalism later on. For the mome nt, it is sufficient to note that it i s most frequently in the family that children are i nfected with nationalism by hearing what is national extolled and what is forei gn disparaged. As chauvinism, this may be more ridiculous than dangerous; but it must, nonetheless, be regarded as the complet e negation of world mindedness. . . . As long as th e child breathes the poisoned air of nationalism, education in world mindedness can produce only rather precarious results. As we have pointed out, it is frequently the family that infects the child with e xtreme nationalism. The school should therefore use the means described earlier to combat family attitudes that favor jingoism. . . . if the feeling of belonging to the human community develops normally by extension of the feeling of belonging t o the natio nal community, it cannot possibly develop from that caricature of pat riotism which is extreme nationalism. 19 Touching on the subject of teaching, geography in o ur schools, the same UNESCO publication states: One method much in use now is to teach geography in a series of widening circles, beginning with local geography (i.e. the c lassroom, the school building and its surroundings, the village, the county) and proceeding to a study of the nation and the continent. Only when that routine ha s been accomplished is the child introduced to the rest of the world. This pro gress from the particular and the immediate to the general and the remote may be logi cal, but does it serve the purpose? In some atlases, the child's country is sh own on every page on the same scale as the map to which it is to be compared . This is an admirable device, but would it not be better still if the first map constantly be fore the eves of the child were a map of the world? . . . This seeme d to us so important that we were led to hope that UNESCO might persuade a publi sher to prepare a world map that would really touch the c hild's imagination. . . . It should summarize the splendors of the earth; and when, later on, the chi ld began the study of national geography, he would be already partly immunized aga inst an exaggerated sense of the importance and beauty of his own country ; that is to say, against the error of perspective which is at the root of jingoism and nationalism. . . . In addition, the geography teacher should never allow to go unch allenged statements from his pupils which reveal a supercilious feeling of n ational s uperiority. . . . The teacher who has, himself, a broad world outlook, wi ll find many opportunities for influencing the minds of his pupils both in normal school sessions and in his personal contacts with them. 20 In Volume 10 of UNESCO's Toward World Understanding, George Washington is given as an example of the \"hero-type\" which has to be expunged from history. This volume condemns all \"presentation to the young of 'hero-types' in whom virtues are, so to speak, incarnated.\" UNESCO bemoans the fact that such figures are . . . spoken of with admiration, and there is an im plicit expectation t hat some children, at least, will look at these heroes as ex amples and model their own character and attitudes upon them.. . . Children do not content themselves with studying the heroes of national history simply as s ignificant human beings [but] identify themselves with them, at least to some degree, and may attempt to mold their conduct upon theirs. Volume 6 is rich in variations on the theme that th e government must replace the family. It stresses the importance of \"freeing the child more and more from the family.\""},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Getting back to the question of ways and means, UNE SCO's Volume 5 of Toward World Understanding said: The kindergarten or infant school has a significant part to play in the child's education. Not only can it correct many of the erro rs of h ome training, but it can also prepare the child for membership in the world society. For older children, Volume 1 has this to say: The idealism of youth should be appealed to, but it is essential to remember that the adolescent's enthusiasm can quickly turn to disappointment and disillusionment. . . . It will be found that childr en grasp more quickly and more firmly the principles of the UN and its agencies if the teaching is related to practical activities, such as the international chi ldren's emergency fund [UNICEF], or UNESCO's work of education reconstruct ion in the war- devastated countries. Over the past twenty years the concept of education in America has gradually changed until today it is shockingly UNESCO-oriented. And this includes mo re than attitudes toward patriotism and religion. Increasing emphasis has been placed on UNESCO's pro gram of replacing scholastic achievement with such vagaries as \"human adjustment,\" \"group co nsciousness,\" and \"social cooperation.\" Our educational system has been shifting away from one which trains children to think and to understand, toward one which is preoccupied with turning out in tellectual paralytics who do not question the authorities but readily conform with the group. Our primary concern here, however, is not with UNES CO's program of mental paralysis, but with its assault on patriotism, religion and moral standards among our youth. One clear example of how far this poison has seeped into the air of American aca demic circles is a series of psychological tests called Reading for Understanding which was prepared by an organization known as Scie nce Research Associates (SRA). These tests have been wi dely used in approximately seven thousand public school districts across the United States an d are highly praised by teachers' associations and school administrators. As the following sample ques tions will reveal, however, the tests not only require the student to assume the veracity of a pre liminary statement which is loaded with editorial opinion, but they use half-truths and untruths to u ndermine traditional concepts of religion, morality and constitutional government.

[Correct answer: \"happiness and unhappiness.\"] If we would but open our eyes and look, we would be shocked at the extent to which this UNESCO virus has spread. On Flag Day in a school in White Plains, New York, American children were presented with a flag at an impressive ceremony in which even the city government participated. It was not Old Glory; it was the flag of the United Na tions. 21 A University of Chicago instructor by the name of M ilton Mayer was quoted by the Syracuse Post- Standard as saying in a public speech: \"We must haul down th e American flag; and if I wanted to be vulgar and shocking, I would go even further and sa y, haul it down, stamp on it and spit on it!\" The newspaper reported that \"most of the audience of ne arly 200 persons greeted Mayer's statement with prolonged applause.\" 22 How did this come about? How have our youngsters be en brought to accept this insidious mental conditioning? If you would really like to know the answer, write to the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare, Office of Education, and ask for information on how to better teach about the United Nations in our schools. One such b ooklet, entitled Teaching About the United Nations in United States Educational Institutions, goes into minute detail explaining how the followin g school programs can be made most effective: panel d iscussions, notebooks and reports, audio- visuals, reading assignments, UN clubs, UNICEF driv es, essay contests, speech contests, field trips to UN headquarters, and model UN meetings. It is a total saturation program that no child can escape. On March 4, 1962, the National Broadcasting Company put on an NBC Special entitled Regards to George M. Cohan. You will remember that Cohan wrote many patriotic s ongs including \"It's a Grand Old Flag.\" In this NBC Special, one of the actors c ame forward holding an American flag and said: \"I guess everybody knows that George M. Cohan wrote a lot of songs about this. The Cohan brand of patriotism is a little old fashioned and naive for these confused times.\" 23 Things have even gone so far that in 1963 the commu nity of Catonsville, Maryland, selected \"Salute to the UN\" as the theme for its Independence Day parade! In 1958 the McDonnell Aircraft Company made UN Day its seventh paid holiday. Company officials stated that they hoped the idea would \"spread throu ghout the world.\" Consequently, on June 21, the"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Philadelphia Bulletin ran a story headlined \"Firm Makes UN Day a Paid Ho liday.\" And on the very next day, the same paper had another news story wit h the heading: \"Some Philadelphia Banks Drop Flag Day as a Holiday.\" What effect has this anti-American conditioning had so far on the minds of our youth who have been subjected to it? How do we go about measuring the r esults? Unfortunately, there are so many unhealthy indications all around us that it is hard to begin. They range all the way from the rising juvenile crime rate, which is the inevitable result of a philosophy that says \"truth is man-made\" and \"good is happiness,\" to student riots against congr essional committees investigating Communist subversion. But perhaps the most tangible or measur able results were those observed among our fighting men who were captured in Korea. These boys represented a fairly accurate cross sect ion of the American youth that had been processed by our educational system since this thin king came into favor. They came from the same kind of homes and backgrounds as our soldiers in al l previous wars. Yet, their behavior as prisoners was startlingly different. For the first time in Am erican military history, very few captured American soldiers escaped. Many of them signed \"confessions\" and in other ways collaborated with the enemy, not as a result of torture, but because they got be tter treatment that way and because they did not think it mattered anyway. And some even chose to de fect to Communism rather than return to America after the war. The underlying reason for th is unexpected behavior was explained rather dramatically by the Communists themselves. During the course of the fighting sever al secret Communist intelligence reports were intercepted by American forces. Some of these dealt with the handling of American prisoners of war. The followin g message was written by the chief of intelligence of the Chinese Peoples Volunteer Army in North Kore a to the chief of intelligence of the Chinese Peoples Republic in Peiping: Based upon our observations of American soldiers an d their officers captured in this war for the liberation of Korea from capitalis t- imperialist aggression, the following facts are evident: The American soldier has weak loyalty to his family , his community, his country, his religion and to his fellow soldier. His concept s of right and wrong are hazy and ill- formed. Opportunism is easy for him. By himself, he feels frightened and insecure . He underestimates his own worth, his own strength , and his ability to survive. He is ignorant of social values, social te nsions and conflicts. There is little knowledge or understanding even among U.S. u niversity graduates of American political history a nd philosophy; the federal, state and community organizations, states and civil rights, freedoms, s afeguards, checks and balances, and how these things allegedly operate wi thin his own system. . . . He fails to appreciate the meaning of and the neces sity f or military or any form of organization or discipline. Most often he clearly f eels that his military service is a kind of hateful and unavoidable servitude to be tol erated as briefly as possible and then escaped from as rapidly as possible with a s little i nvestment as possible. . . . Based upon these facts about the imperialist United States aggressors, the reeducation and reindoctrination program for Americ an prisoners proceeds as planned. 24 In 1962 the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee cond ucted an investigation of Military Cold War Education and Speech Review Policies. During the course of the hearings, Admiral George W . Anderson, chief of naval operations, testified as f ollows: There were maybe 65% or 70% of youngsters who came in with really a lack of appreciation of discipline, either imposed or self- discipline. You might say at "},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"times they were in a state of delayed adolescence, and t his is the group that it was so important that we work on and devote our gre atest talents to, whether they ultimately are to stay in the Navy or return t o civilian life. These are the people on which we ha ve to depend in the service and on which America is going to have to depend. . . . General David M. Shoup, commandant of the Marine Co rps, said: They are the same kind of human beings [as recruite d in the past] but they have not been exposed to what thi s country means and what it took to make this country what it is today. They have not been given a realization of the worthwhileness of our way of life and that it is wo rth giving your life for if necessary. 25 All of which is right to the point. Who on earth wo uld be willing to risk his life to defend America i f he had been taught from kindergarten that love of one' s own country is the major evil of our modem world? And if no one is willing to take such a stan d, how long can we hold out against the fiercely aggressive force of world Communism? While the Sovi et Communists are busy inculcating in their youth a strong loyalty to the Russian fatherland an d to a precise dogma, UNESCO encourages Americans to deny their own children comparable con victions. When there no longer appears to be anything worth defending, America will be lost. It should come as no surprise, therefore, to find t hat UNESCO has chosen to locate a western hemisphere headquarters in Communist Cuba since Cub a is, at present, the most solid Soviet satellite in this hemisphere. From there, it can ca rry on its subversion and propaganda activities throughout all of North and South America. An interesting sidelight on this development occurr ed during a UNESCO conference held in Paris in 1960. Castro's Cuba submitted a report to the other delegates at the conference which read in part: Law 680 was promulgated to lay the foundations of a new, more rational and effective general system of education. UNESCO exper ts have cooperated in this great task. . . . As will be seen in the following account of the implementation of UNESCO's major pr ojects, Cuba, precisely by virtue of the revolution ary movement that is the driving force of our country, is one of the foremost nations in the world in the implementation of these project s. . . . One token of the high regard in which the revolutionary gov ernment holds UNESCO and the aims it pursues, is the fact that the Cuban National Commis sion at present has the largest budget since it was estabhshed. 26 And now UNESCO is hoping that the United States Sen ate will ratify a proposed treaty known as the convention against discrimination in education. Wha t would this treaty accomplish? As summarized in a joint statement by Congressmen John Ashbrook, Wil liam Ayres, Donald C. Bruce, Edgar Hiestand and David Martin: UNESCO's proposed new treaty . . . would deliver th e entire American educational system into UNESCO international contro l. It could close every private and parochial school in the United States. It would automatically remove education from under \"domestic\" law and control. It encompasses every phase and facet of American education. 27 Unless Americans wake up soon and do something to c lear away this UN poison in the air, the treaty will be ratified and we will then learn the full meaning of Earl Browder's words when he declared: Who wins the youth, wins the future of America ."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"NOTES 1.

Adolph Hitler, Mein Kampf CHAPTER THIRTEEN: THE FRIGHT PEDDLERS On January 21, 1962, the Communist Worker ran an article entitled \"Birchers Take Warpath Aga inst UN Peace Hopes.\" The following excerpts are taken f rom this article: The John Birch Society has instructed its members t o prepare a hate campaign against the United Na tions. In his secret \"bulletin\" for members, Robert Welch, fuehrer of the Birchites, orders his followers to p lace this anti- United Nations drive at the top of their 1962 political agenda. St eps on how to do his bidding are detailed by Welch and are, in fact, already being t aken by ultra- rightists. . . . \"The UN is a tool of the Reds,\" says the Birch Bulletin. \"The only real function of the United Nations is to serve as an instrumentality of Communist global conquest,\" is how Robert Welch puts it. And this theme of the ultras runs through much of the Birch Society and similar extremist propaganda of late. Its obvious aim is to undermine the faith of the American people in the U nited Nations. . . . It was in the spring of last year that the ultra hate campaig n to destroy the United Nations actually began. The origins of this insidious busin ess can be traced to . . . a so- called \"United States Day Committee,\" the purpose o f which was to replace United Nations Day with \"United States Day.\" . . . 1 Throughout the following year, more and more people began to wake up to the terrible menace that our continued participation in the United Nations r epresented. As the volume of mail to Washington demanding withdrawal from the United Nations began to reach sizable proportions, those politicians who have long had no opposition to their internatio nalist policies became irate and alarmed. Perhaps the most outspoken among these was Senator Thomas K uchel of California. In a much publicized speech before the Senate, Kuchel lashed out at what he called a hate campaign against the United Nations conducted by ultra-rightists, lunatics and extremists. Since many of his constituents had cite d cases of United Nations atrocities in the Congo, Se nator Kuchel called them fright peddlers. Gus Hall, present head of the U.S. Communist party was delighted with Senator Kuchel's speech. Writing in the Communist Worker of June 23, 1963, be said that the Republican part y was in danger of being taken over by what he called \"fanatical ul tra-right-wingers.\" But he made a special point to single out Kuchel's speech as hopeful evidence that \"moderates\" within the Republican ranks have not lost out altogether. A few months later, CBS produced an hour-long TV do cumentary entitled Case History of a Rumor . The hero of the program was none other than Senator Thomas Kuchel who was presented as the all- American champion of restraint and common sense aga inst all the irresponsible fright peddlers who think that the United Nations poses any kind of a t hreat to this country. The villain in the documenta ry was Congressman James Utt, also of California. Cong ressman Utt has been outspoken in his criticism of the United Nations and was the man who introduced legislation to get us out of the organization altogether. CBS, as has been the case in many of its other TV documentaries, did a masterful job of appearing to be objective while cr eating a lasting impression that definitely favors the anti-anti-Communist point of view. Unfortunately, millions of Americans have allowed t heir attitudes to be affected by such professional presentations, never investigating the facts for th emselves. Even more tragic is the fact that they seldom suspect their opinions have been manipulated . They have had very little cause to challenge those opinions since, as mentioned in the Foreword of this book, the other side has not yet had a chance to speak up. Pro-UN forces have easy access to our television networks, our large"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"metropolitan newspapers, and our mass circulation m agazines. Forces critical of the United Nations are shouted down, labeled extremist, and relegated to the futile circulation of mimeographed pamphlets and newsletters. As the forty-six civilia n doctors of Elisabethville explained: \"What could we do against an organization having the most power ful means of broadcasting false news, lies, denials? We had the weak voice of Radio-Katanga, th e official telegraph service, one or two teleprinters, and the small amateur radio stations. \" 2 Thoughtful Americans should ask themselves why it i s that one seldom runs into strong opposition to the United Nations that is not made to appear ridic ulous by most of our mass communications media. Is it because all such opposition is ridiculous? Is there not one person or organization worth listeni ng to? Why is it that we all know that Presidents Trum an, Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson have lavishly praised the United Nations but we have not been told that former President Hoover, as long ago as 1950, said that \"unless the United Nations i s completely reorganized without the Communists in it, we should get out of it\"? Why is it that we are familiar with Senator Kuchel's views but no one mentions Senator Taft's position: \"The United Natio ns has become a trap. Let's go it alone\"; or Senator Langer's position: \"I feel from the bottom of my heart that the adoption of the Charter . . . will mean perpetuating war\"; or Senator McCarran's posit ion: \"Until my dying day, I will regret signing the United Nations Charter\"? We have all heard Adlai St evenson refer to the United Nations as the \"moral conscience of the world,\" but how many of us have heard that J. B. Matthews, former chief investigator for the House Committee on Un-American Activities said: \"I challenge the illusion that th e UN is an instrument of peace. . . . It could not be less of a cruel hoax if it had been organized in H ell for the sole purpose of aiding and abetting the des truction of the United States\"? In a speech before the United Nations Correspondent s Association in 1961, UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson reviewed the rules which most of our news men have apparently been following for twenty years. Referring to UN delegates and personnel, Ste venson said: Help us to create th e sense of our overriding human concern. Interpret us to each other, not as plotters or as war mongers or as demons or demagogues, but as puzzled, yet aspiring men and women struggling o n the possible brink of Armageddon to achieve a common understanding a nd a common approach. We are not at all like that, I have no doubt, but I be lieve that a majority of our delegates would accept such a description of their own attitudes. The whole press corps working at the UN has a unique part to play in projecting this picture . . . . 3 On October 23, 1963, the Committee for United State s Day held a meeting in the Dallas Memorial Auditorium at which Major General Edwin A. Walker s poke critically of the United Nations before an audience of approximately 1,200. In spite of effort s on the part of the committee, none of the news reporting media gave the meeting advance publicity nor did any of the local stations broadcast the speech. The next evening, however, Adlai Stevenson made a UN Day speech in the same auditorium to an audience of about 1,700 people. This program was sponsored by the Dallas United Nations Association and the Dallas League of Women Voters. Whereas the United States Day committee paid all of its own bills, we can be sure that Mr. Stevenson traveled from New York and stayed in Dallas at taxpayers expense. His visit was given an enormous amount of advance publicity by local news media, and the CBS station in Dallas even dona ted a full hour of prime time (preempting the Perry Mason show) to broadcast Stevenson's speech. The bias of our mass news communication media and t he resultant devastating effect that this bias has had on American public opinion is, of course, a vast subject too large to be adequately dealt with here. But one need only reflect for a moment on the following episode to grasp the full significance o f how far this process has gone. Mr. George Todt, a w ell-known West Coast columnist and news commentator, tells this story: On Sunday, September 5, 1954, I made some remarks a bout the United Nations on my extemporaneous television program telecast fr om the studios of the "},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"National Broa dcasting Company in Hollywood, California. They wer e not the usual mouthings one hears from the men in the commu nications field nowadays. Instead of bowing and scraping before the UN, I out lined some hard cold facts about this threat to the sovereignty of the United States and suggested an alternative plan to the UN for those Americans of h onest intent who felt obliged to work for international understanding in the futu re. My suggestion revolved about the Constitution of the United States, howeve r, not the UN Charter. Although the public responded overwhelmingly in fav or of the suggestion I made in preference to the present UN plan, not so NBC. T he reaction of the latter was hasty and bitter. As soon as the officials returned to their offices the following T uesday morning, after the Labor Day holiday, it was to notify me immediately that I was off the air. Although never on the NBC p ayroll, they denied time to my sponsor of 57 weeks standing unless be broke my con tract forthwith, and refused to allow me to go on the air for two more weeks prior to cancellatio n as my contract stipulated. This was done without a wor d of warning or prior consultation. Everything had been fine up until the time I spoke against the UN. Then I was suddenly persona non grata with the National Broadcasting Company. 4 The process of squelching opposition to the United Nations is far from limited to just the mass communications media. In 1955, for instance, Ron Ra msey, a sixteen-year-old high school student in Compton, California, began writing letters to the e ditors of local newspapers and magazines. His letters were well written, factual, and strongly cr itical of the United Nations. As a result, he soon became the target of a vicious smear campaign condu cted by a Communist-front group calling itself an \"anti-Nazi league.\" This group sent out thousand s of postcards calling Ramsey a \"Hitlerite\" and urging his neighbors and fellow students to mobiliz e against him \"before he acquires any more power.\" Joseph L. Causey, a member of the board of trustees of the Compton Union High School district, charged Ramsey with the unforgivable crim e. In a letter to the editor of the Los Angeles Times, Causey exclaimed: \"This lad is opposed to th e United Nations and preaches anti-UNESCO propaganda.\" Ramsey was subsequently committed to a county institution as a \"mental case\" with no formal charges ever brought against him. He was fin ally released on probation after thirty-four days o f confinement, but only on the condition that he stop writing letters to the papers. 5 The extent of radio and TV coverage favorable to th e United Nations is a matter of daily record. From the very beginning, it has been an avalanche. For i nstance, on the occasion of the United Nations' tenth anniversary, in 1955, the Communist Daily Worker reported: Radio and TV coverage of the UN's tenth anniversary was the best in that world organization's history. The UN concert with Soviet pianist Emil Gilels, the New York Philharmonic and the Schola Cantorum was telev ised by WOR and heard on radio stations WQXR and WNYC. One report said th at a movie of the concert was being sent to Latin America and that a tape rec ording of same would be aired by Voice of America. In addition, station WINS in New York and 55 other U.S. stations carried Norman Corwin's play The Charter and the Saucer , a British Broadcasting drama on the UN with Sir Lawrence Oliv ier. A quarter- hour film titled Your Seat at the Table with Clifton Fadiman was heard on WABC and many other stations across the country. The Family Tree was broadcast by ABC. Throughout the weekend of the anniversary, NBC's Monitor featured spot salutes to the UN from delegates and celebrities. The popul ar children's TV show Let' s Take a Trip visited UN headquarters last Sunday. Ding Dong School also had its enormous following watching a movie on the UN. The Carousel's weekend show was devoted to the UN. CBS's Morning Show did a series of live pick- ups from the UN, and Dave Garroway's NBC show featured UN po sters. 6 As a result of this kind of pro-UN programming, it is no wonder that we have come to accept unchallenged the premise that the United Nations is the epitome of good. We have been brought to"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"the point where the mere mention of the name strike s within us a conditioned response of devout reverence. As important as radio and TV are in reaching and mo lding public opinion, however, the United Nations and those who promote it do not stop there. The American Association for the United Nations (AAUN) spends millions of tax exempt dollars to dis tribute free literature, provide speakers and promote tours of United Nations headquarters. In 19 62 a U.S. Air Force recruiting poster appeared which depicted a young man and woman in Air Force u niforms walking down a street in a foreign country. It was the usual appeal to youth's desire for travel and adventure. But there was something significantly different about this poster. Aside fr om the happy faces of the figures, the only other conspicuous item in the picture was a huge UN flag. U.S. recruiting posters used to display the American flag. 7 Speaking of the UN flag, this, too, has played a pa rt in creating the desired attitude in the minds of Americans. Designing the flag was actually made the subject of a school project for children in California. As early as May 1944 the California Sta te Department of Education issued a bulletin entitled A Study in World Friendship--Designing a Symbol for the United Nations . Needless to say, no one ever intended that these children would design the United Nations flag; the whole object, even then, was to begin to have all the kiddies thinking favorably toward the coming world government. What better way than to create the impression that they had a part in designing its flag? The UN flag was actually created in the presentation branch of the United States Office of Strategic Services in April of 1945. The man who headed this department a t the time and who supervised the flag design was Carl Aldo Marzani. It was later revealed that M arzani was a member of the Communist party and operated under the party name of Tony Whales. 8 Considering this, it is possible that the striking similarity between the symbols of the United Nation s and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is more than a mere coincidence. Using children to promote UN projects has, by now, become standard operational procedure. It has the double advantage of appealing to the parental a nd protective instincts of adults while, at the sam e time, it has a profound influence on the attitudes of the children themselves who participate. For instance, in 1960 the United Nations Children's Fun d (UNICEF) distributed a promotional folder designed for children entitled How Children Help Children Through UNICEF . The back page, illustrated with crude drawings of a cow, a truck a nd a child, reads: Many children in Italy call a cow \"UNICEF\" because they never tasted milk before UNICEF came. Many children in Brazil think t he American word for truck is \"UNICEF.\" And in the hills near Galilee, one little boy said: \"My father says in Heaven there is God; here there is UNICEF--Please h elp my people.\" This is the kind of calculated tug on the heart str ings that loosens the purse strings. Tattered and starving children peer at us from billboards, baseb all stars and movie celebrities urge us over radio and TV to give generously, and professional organiz ers appear in each community to excite an uncritical emotion of compassion. Community leaders are maneuvered into endorsing a project they do not understand and an organization whose budget they are never permitted to see. And then ordinary housewives, enthusiastic because they are sincere, march from home to home ringing doorbells. But if the person who is being solicited questions the noble cause in any way, those volunteers are apt to be miffed and feel insulted. After all, they know that their own motives are beyond reproach and, since they have already identi fied themselves emotionally with the cause, they cannot help but react with horror when they find so meone so cruel and selfish as to ask questions when tiny children are starving. In 1962 UNICEF sent out another folder entitled How Halloween Fun Can Help Needy Children All Over the World Through Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF . The back page reads: What a UNICEF Halloween can mean. One cent--five gl asses of milk. Five cents- -vaccine to protect five children from TB. Ten cent s-- penicillin to cure two "},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"children of Yaws. Twenty-five cents--125 vitamin ta blets. The amount of concern that UNICEF really has about the money it spends was best illustrated by Miss Florence Fowler Lyons who revealed that in one case when UNICEF received one dollar for two teacher's manuals advertised in one of its trick-or -treat promotional pamphlets, it sent not only the manuals, but a large box containing hundreds of exp ensively printed brochures glorifying the purposes and accomplishments of UNICEF. This unrequ ested and unwanted material was shipped first class airmail at a total postage cost of $10.40. 9 According to UN statistics this could have purchased 5200 glasses of milk. That's an awful lot of milk! Each year, over two million dollars are raised for UNICEF by American children on Halloween night. But much of this money is consumed in administrativ e costs before it ever reaches the point where it is available for needy children. Even though two mi llion dollars is a considerable amount, it is a dro p in the bucket compared with UNICEF's total budget. As a matter of fact, less than two percent of UNICEF's total funds come from this trick-or-treat drive. The rest comes from tax money that has been given directly to UNICEF by the government. Th e real importance to UNICEF of this Halloween drive was inadvertently disclosed by the U.S. Commi ttee for UNICEF in a defense bulletin which had been prepared to expose what it called unfounded ch arges against UNICEF. The committee said: The truth in connection with this is that Trick-or- Treat for UNICEF is primarily an education program. More than 2,000,000 American chi ldren [it is now 3,000,000] annually participate in the project in some 10,000 communities. 10 On October 31, 1963, Arthur Godfrey said on his CBS network program: As a matter of f act, you will see a lot of them [children] around t rick-or- treating for UNICEF again, the United Nations Children's Fund. W hen your doorbell rings on Halloween, it may be a child collecting for UNICEF. And again this year American children are helping thou sands of needy children and mothers in 116 foreign countries. And that starts the avalanche of mail saying it's Communist- inspired and all this business; but our government thinks it's okay and so does the advertising council and so do other responsible pa rties, so I guess we'll stick with it. An article in the May 1959 issue of the National Education Association Journal stated that the children were drawn into a lot of preliminary activ ity in many schools \"from drawing maps and posters to writing and performing an original television pl ay.\" Some schools administered \"study units on the interdependency of nations.\" At least one school fo llowed up the Halloween stunt with a program lasting all year and culminated in a miniature UN a ssembly with each student representing the country of his choice.\" The examples are endless. In 1951 the U.S. National Citizens Committee of UN Day distributed over 30,000 copies of A Useful Teacher's Guide: Planning for United Natio ns Day , and over 1,300,000 other pieces of literature were mailed out. Over 50 ,000 kits containing materials and instructions to make hand-sewn UN flags were distributed, and over half a million women and girls across the nation participated in the project. United Nations propaganda is even in the comic book s. For instance, the inside cover of a recent issue of Superman contains an illustrated tale of h ow the United Nations World Health Organization came to the rescue and saved a small Burmese villag e from the bubonic plague. At the end of the story, we find: \"This is your United Nations at wor k! When yon celebrate UN Day on October 24th, be proud your country is a member nation. Through the UN, our nation is working with other nations for better health and happiness for people the world ov er.\""},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"What this all adds up to was clearly stated by Mr. George D. Stoddard, president of the University of Illinois and a member of UNESCO's executive board. Speaking before a UNESCO gathering in 1949, he said: A Gallup Poll showing that only 1% of the people ha d ever h eard of UNESCO is not depressing. It means that hardly anybody has be en turned against it! How many people can name the five most important commit tees in the U.S. Senate? How many can name all the countries in Central and South America? How many persons kn ow the official name of the Marshall plan? The impo rtant question is, how many persons will be affected by UNESCO, whethe r they know it or not, and in what ways? . . . UNESCO is a part of the fundame ntal law of 40 nations; as such, it need not be on the de fensive. Clearly, the 40 member states are themselves on the defensive. 11 In spite of this continuous bombardment on the subc onscious thinking of Americans for almost two decades, the number of people who are beginning to question the UN continues to grow. So much so, in fact, that by June of 1963 the master planne rs were beginning to worry. The National Advertising Council publicly announced on June 24 t hat it had been called in to help resell the UN to the American people because, as it put it, \"The Uni ted Nations is considered by close observers . . . to have lost some of its grip on public opinion.\" 12 With the help of a Madison Avenue advertising firm , the National Advertising Council launched a giganti c campaign in the press, radio and TV valued at over five million dollars! As you may recall, the g immick that was used as the main theme for this campaign was a picture of a huge and frightening mu shroom cloud of an H-bomb explosion. And after thus sending a calculated chill down our spin es at the thought of nuclear holocaust, the advertising experts then flashed the words: \"This I s One Alternative To The United Nations!\" Now really, who are the \"fright peddlers\"?

General James A. Van Fleet In carrying out the instructions of my Government, I gained the unenviable distinction of being the first U.S. Army commander in history to sign an armistice without victory. General Mark Clark CHAPTER FOURTEEN: A SUBSTITUTE FOR VICTORY One of the most famous quotations of the Korean War is General MacArthur's \"There is no substitute for victory.\" But MacArthur was removed from comman d for wanting to translate this philosophy into action; and a less well-known quotation became the prevailing American policy. It was Eleanor Roosevelt who set the new pace when she said: \"One of the most painful lessons we have to learn is to adapt ourselves to the kind of war which ends wi thout total victory. . . .\" 1 Until the United States became a member of the Unit ed Nations, of course, we had never fought a war that ended in anything except victory. And we c ould easily have achieved victory in Korea if it hand not been for our unnatural subservience to for eign interests. Since the Korean War is often cited as one of the outstanding achievements of the UN, it is worth our while to take a brief look at a few of the less obvious aspects of this tragic affa ir. In 1947 General Albert C. Wedemeyer was sent to the Far East to make an official military appraisal of conditions there. In his report to President Tru man, General Wedemeyer stated: Whereas American and S oviet forces engaged in occupation duties in South and North Korea respectively are approximately equal, e ach comprising less than 50,000 troops, the Soviet equipped and trained Nort h Korean Peoples Army of approximately 125,000 is vastly superior to the U .S. organized constabulary of 16,000 Koreans equipped with Japanese small arms. T he North Korean Peoples Army constitutes a potential military threat to Sou th Korea, since there is a strong possibility that the Soviets will withdraw their oc cupation forces , and thus induce our own withdrawal. This probably will take place j ust as soon as they can be sure that the North Korean puppet government and it s armed forces which they have created are strong enough and sufficiently wel l indoctrinated to be relied upon to carry out Soviet objectives without the act ual presence of Soviet troops. 2 This, of course, is exactly what happened, but Gene ral Wedemeyer's report was, at Secretary of State George Marshall's insistence, suppressed and denied to both Congress and the public. After we had withdrawn most of our troops in accord ance with a United Nations resolution, our Army general headquarters in South Korea began sending r epeated and urgent reports to Washington warning that there was an unmistakable military bui ldup just above the 38th Parallel. One such report even contained the date of the expected North Korea n attack. 3 In spite of these reports, however, and despite the fact that money had been appropriat ed by Congress for the purpose of building up South Korea's defenses, officialdom somehow managed to stall and delay for over three months so"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"that no military equipment--not even ammunition--wa s delivered to reinforce South Korea. 4 Yet, when the attack finally came Washington officials preten ded to be surprised and taken off guard. One thing is certain: if we knew that the Communists were preparing for over a year to attack South Korea, the Communists knew it too! That may seem too obvious to mention, yet nine out of ten Americans have never considered the possibility tha t the Communists wanted the United Nations to commit the U.S. to fight in Korea. If the Communist s had not wanted the Korean War, they would not have started it. And if they had not wanted the UN to go through the motions of trying to oppose them, they would have vetoed the action in the Secu rity Council. As part of the show, however, the Soviet delegation had stage-managed an impressive w alkout supposedly in protest over the defeat of a motion to seat Red China. Consequently, when the attack came, the Soviets supposedly outsmarted themselves by not being on hand to admin ister the veto. But, as we have just stated, the assumption that the Communists did not know well in advance that the whole thing was coming is absurd. They planned it! The fact that they were conveniently absent whe n the issue came before the UN only shows that they needed a surface excuse to refrain from the veto. The actual course of the war is well known by all. Our tiny occupational force had been deliberately kept unprepared for the sudden massive assault. It was overwhelmed, backed into the Pusan pocket, and hovered on the brink of being pushed into the s ea. There is no doubt that the Communists fully expected to sweep us off the peninsula with hardly any opposition, which would have been quite a prestige-builder for them around the world. They wo uld have done it, too, if it had not been for the independent Americanism of General MacArthur and th e bravery of his troops. As MacArthur, himself, recalled: \"The only predictions from Washi ngton at that time warned of impending military disaster. Then, too, our ammunition was critically short. . . . General [Walton] Walker, at one stage, was down to five rounds per gun. His heroically suc cessful efforts under unparalleled shortages of all sorts constituted an amazing military exploit.\" 5 Hopelessly outnumbered by the enemy, General MacArt hur conceived one of the most brilliant maneuvers in military history: the Inchon landing. It was a daring surprise flank attack aimed at cutting off the North Korean supply lines. It worke d beautifully and, as a result, the enemy forces disintegrated and were nearly destroyed. As General MacArthur stated: By the latter part of October, the capitol of Pyong yang was captured. These events completely transformed the situation from pe ssimism to optimism. This was the golden moment to translate military victory to a politically advantageous peace. Success in war involves military as well as political considerations. For the sacrifice leading to a military victory would b e pointless if not translated properly to the political advantage of peace. But w hat happened was just the contrary. 6 There was early evidence that the North Korean forc es were being trained and equipped by the Soviets and, after the Inchon landing, that the Chi nese Communists were providing actual combat troops by the thousands. 7 Lt. General Samuel E. Anderson, commander of the F ifth Air Force, revealed that entire Soviet Air Force units fought in the Korean War for over two and a half years \"to gain combat experience for the pilots.\" All in all, some 425 Migs were being flown by Russian pilots. 8 The Soviets never even tried to conceal their part in the war. When United States Ambassador Lodge complained to the General Assembly's political comm ittee that \"Soviet planning instigated the original aggression, which was subsequently maintained by So viet training and equipment,\" Vyshinsky, the Soviet delegate, calmly admitted the substance of t he charge and replied, \"Mr. Lodge is pushing at an open door.\" 9 In spite of all this, the United States Government refused to allow General MacArthur to pursue the enemy across the Yalu River or even to bomb the bri dges over which the Chinese Communists transported their troops and supplies. The official reason given was to prevent a war between the United States and Red China! The real reason, since we were already in a war with Red Ch ina, was"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"simply that the United Nations did not want us to o btain a victory in Korea, and we had, by this time, agreed to go along with whatever the UN wanted. The typical view of so many of our UN allies was ex pressed in The Fabian Essays, published in London in 1952, with a preface by Prime Minister Cl ement Attlee. On page 31 the author, R. H. Crossman, says: \"A victory for either side [in the cold war] would be defeat for socialism. We are members of the Atlantic Alliance (NATO); but this d oes not mean that we are enemies of every Communist revolution. We are opposed to Russian exp ansion, but also to an American victory.\" 10 In 1950, when Congress appropriated rather substant ial sums of money to carry on the Korean War, and it looked as though we just might start thinkin g in terms of pressing for a victory, Prime Ministe r Attlee rushed to the United States to confer with P resident Truman. His mission was aptly described by the U.S. News and World Report which stated: The British Government continues to maintain direct diplomatic relations with the Chinese Communists . . . even though Chinese armies were killing British youths. . . . To Mr. Attlee, China's Mao Tse-tung s ti ll is an official friend. . . . He does big business with the British through Hong Kon g. British businessmen are accepted in China. . . . The British want to get ri d of Chiang and turn Formosa over to the Communists. They oppose any move inside China that might embarrass the Communist regime. . . . Mr. Attlee st ill hopes for a deal covering Asia, while keeping up the appearance of a fight in Korea. 11 Mr. Attlee was needlessly alarmed, for on November 16, 1950, President Truman announced: \"Speaking for the U.S. Government and people, I can give assurances that we support and are acting within the limits of the UN policy in Korea and tha t we have never at any time entertained any intention to carry hostilities into China.\" 12 When the Chinese crossed the Yalu, General MacArthu r instantly ordered the bridges--six of them-- destroyed by our Air Force. Within hours his orders were countermanded from Washington. These bridges still stand. In his bitterness, the general exclaimed, \"I realized for the first time that I h ad actually been denied the use of my full military po wer to safeguard the lives of my soldiers and the safety of my army. To me, it clearly foreshadowed a future tragic situation in Korea and left me with a sense of inexpressible shock.\" 13 Not only did we forbid our army commanders to fight for victory in Korea, we denied them access to military assistance that was readily available. The free Nationalist Chinese on Formosa had offered to send between fifty and sixty thousand fighting men to push back the Chinese Reds. They were confident that with very little difficulty a crushi ng military defeat in North Korea could set off widespread rebellion in Red China itself. The Natio nalist Chinese would have been a valuable help to our forces in any event, since they had a reason to fight and wanted desperately to get into it. They offered troops, but General George Marshall turned them down because it was not felt that Chiang’s troops would be effective, and \"for other reasons.\" On June 27, 1950, President Truman announced: \". . . I am calling upon the Chinese Government on Formosa to cease all air and sea operations against the mainland. The Seventh Fleet will see th at this is done.\" 14 We not only denied our own troops in Korea much-nee ded reinforcements which would have spared us thousands of casualties, but we even sent the U. S. Seventh Fleet to patrol the Formosa Straits to protect the Chinese Reds from attack! In spite of these unprecedented self-imposed handic aps, General MacArthur continued to spoil the Communist plans. At another crucial point in the fi ghting, the enemy once again began to fall apart. I n the last half of May they had been driven back twen ty miles with casualties estimated at one hundred thousand. In order to save them from complete defea t and to give them a breathing spell, UN Soviet delegate Jacob Malik proposed negotiations for a ce ase-fire at the 38th Parallel. And so, with our forces once again poised on the brink of victory, M acArthur was dismissed and our forward"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"movement was halted. As negotiations began, our rep resentatives carried a white flag into a formal assemblage of armed Communists in a spot held by th e Communists. Pictures were taken and used for propaganda purposes all over Asia. The \"paper t iger\" was meekly suing for peace on Communist terms! And make no mistake about it, they were Communist terms. One of the key issues of the earl y negotiations was that of a cease-fire line. We had insisted that the cease-fire line be that point whe re the fighting was going on when all other major agre ements had been reached. The Communists wanted us to work it the other way around. The comp romise: we gave into their demands. Then there was the matter of ports of entry into North Korea. We insisted that twelve major ports of entry be patrolled by our observers to insure that the Commu nists were not receiving military reinforcements. The Communists said that four ports of entry would be sufficient. The compromise : four ports of entry. Another issue was whether or not Chinese Com munists would be permitted to remain in North Korea. We said no; they said yes. The compromise: t hey stayed. Another major issue was who would supervise the truce. We said the UN; the Communists said neutral nations. The compromise: neutral nations. These \"neutral\" nations, incidentally, inc luded Communist Czechoslovakia and Communist Poland. As General Parks later revealed in testimon y before a Senate subcommittee, this so-called neutral nations commission vetoed inspection trips to North Korea when they could, stalled the inspections that they could not prevent, and practi ced outright collusion with the Chinese and North Korean Communists to conceal evidence of treaty vio lations. 15 A UN group, of course, would have been little diffe rent. Consider, for example, the performance of the UN cease-fire negotiating committee which consi sted of Iran, India and Canada. This group finally submitted a proposal to the General Assembly politi cal action committee that the best solution to the Korean problem was to g ive Formosa to Red China and admit Red China to the UN. 16 Incredible as this proposal may seem, the vote was fifty in favor , seven opposed, and one abstention. Even the United States voted for it. The only delegate prese nt with the courage and the conviction to speak out against the proposal as \"abject surrender to Commun ism and aggression\" was Carlos Romulo of the Philippines. John Foster Dulles was, at the time, a member of the United States delegation that supported this resolution. The official reason give n for this incredible vote was that we endorsed it in hopes of winning support for another resolution condemning Red China as an aggressor! 17 One final tragic glimpse at this new American no-wi n policy, which was put into practice in Korea, was provided in a Department of Defense press relea se dated May 15, 1954. It described in detail how high-ranking Russian military officers were act ually on the scene in North Korea directing militar y operations. This, of course, was not news. But then the release stated: They wore civilian clothing and it was forbidden to address them by rank. They were introduced as \"newspaper reporters ,\" but they had supreme authority. . . . A North Korean Major identified two of these Russian \"advisors\" as General Vasilev and Colonel Dolgin. Vasilev, he said, was i n charge of all movements across the 38th Parallel. Another prisoner . . . sa id he actual ly heard General Vasilev give the order to attack on June 25th. 18 General Vasilev had been the chairman of the United Nations Military Staff Committee which, along with the office of the undersecretary-general for p olitical and security council affairs, is responsib le for United Nations military action under the Security C ouncil. As we have already pointed out, the office of the undersecretary-general for political and sec urity council affairs has always been filled by a Communist from a Communist country. Just as the Russian delegates had stage-managed a p honey walkout in order to provide a surface excuse for not vetoing United Nations action in Kor ea, the Russian members of the Military Staff Committee had done exactly the same thing. On Janua ry 19, 1950, General Vasilev stormed out of the Military Staff Committee, supposedly because he suddenly objected to having a representative from Nationalist China on the same committee. As th e previous Defense Department statement revealed, he next showed up in North Korea as one o f the top military planners directing the war"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"against the United Nations--the very organization h e had just a few months earlier served supposedly in the interest of international peace and brotherh ood. Once the war had gotten under way, the Russians ret urned to their seats as members of the United Nations Military Staff Committee. General Vasilev w as not among them, however. He had turned over his position to another Communist, General Iva n A. Skliaro. In effect the Communists were directing both sides of the war! This shocking piece of information was mentioned on the floor of the United States House of Representatives by Congressman James B. Utt of Cali fornia, and was thus brought to the attention of the American people. 19 For the most part, however, the nation's press pla yed down this news. Secretly directing the anti-Communist side in this world-wide struggle is probably the m ost important single facet of Communist strategy. As long as they have a comfortable degree of control over their own opposition, they are perfectly willing to allow some realistic-looking anti-Communism to occur. Otherwise, the anti-Communist followers would soon become impatient with their leadership and take measures to replace it. But by allowing the anti-Co mmunists to go through the motions of fighting the Communists and, if necessary, even allow them a few minor victories here and there, the Communist agents within our ranks can be assured that ultimat e victory will be theirs. No better illustration of this strategy can be found then by merely observing the pattern of United States history since the 1930's. It was this pattern in Korea that prompted General Mark Clark to state that he feared Communists had wormed their way so deeply into our government that they were able to exercise an inordinate degree of power in shaping the course of America. \" I could not help wondering and worrying whether we were faced with open enemies across the conferen ce table and hidden ones who sat with us in our most secret councils.\" 20 Here, then, are the significant results of the Kore an War: 1. The war helped Red China solidify control over i ts people, who were becoming ripe for revolt because of famine and harsh conditi ons. (Tyrants have often used war or the threat of war to preoccupy the minds of their restive subjects.) 2. The war climate in the United States had a simil ar distracting influence on our people as well. Many disastrous measures were intro duced with little or no opposition because \"we must stand behind our govern ment in this great moment of crisis.\" 3. The United States lost considerable prestige, pa rticularly in Asia and Latin America. We became the paper tiger that could not e ven defeat tiny North Korea. 4. We needlessly sacrificed tens of thousands of Am erican lives and bi llions of dollars because other nations in the United Nations did not want us to fight back in earnest. 5. We became further conditioned to the idea of hav ing future control of our military forces under the United Nations. 6. For the first time in American military history the United States was not victorious. This is what advocates of the United Nations hold u p as the UN's greatest single achievement! The whole situation should have appeared absurd, even t o the casual observer. The Communists attacked a peaceful country; the United Nations wen t through the motions of pushing the aggressor back to his border but did everything it could to m ake sure that there was no punishment for the crime. At the conference table, it treated both the attacked and the attacker as respectable equals. I t is like having someone enter your home, attack your wife and shoot your children; and when you call"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"for help, the police merely place the intruder outs ide your house and tell him not to come back. When he breaks in a second time, stabs you in the should er and sets fire to your house, the police react by setting up a neutral committee to negotiate your di fferences. Do we really want this kind of UN justice? Apparent ly we do, for when South Korean President Syngman Rhee wanted to drive the Communists across the 38th Parallel and liberate all of North Korea, President Eisenhower wrote to him and said: \"It was indeed a crime that those who attacked from the North invoked violence to unite Korea unde r their rule. Not only as your official friend, but as your personal friend, I urge that your country not embark upon a similar course.\" 21 While we have been following Eleanor Roosevelt's ad vice and learning \"to adapt ourselves to the kind of war which ends without victory,\" the Commun ists have done just the opposite. While Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson declare that the United Nations is the cornerstone of United States foreign policy, Nikita Khrushchev boasts: Even if all the countries of the world adopted a de cision that did not accord with the interests of the Soviet Union and threatened it s security , the Soviet Union would not recognize such a decision but would uphol d its rights, relying on force. 22 What an uneven contest it is when one compares that with the utterances of our own United Nations Ambassador Adlai Stevenson: Every time, as a result of a confrontation of opini on, one of us says, even to himself, \"I hadn't quite seen it in that light before,\" or \"I had no idea you felt so strongly about this,\" or \"That's a point I hadn't f ully appreciated\"-- every time we say something like that, even to ourselves, somewhe re in this vast celestial electronic board which charts our movemen ts toward or away from atomic annihilation, a little green light flashes and the traffic of man moves an inch away from the point of collision. 23 One can almost hear the following exchange: Khrushchev: \"Americans are criminals for having use d germ warfare in Korea!\" Stevenson: \"I hadn't seen it in that light before.\" Khrushchev: \"We will bury you!\" Stevenson: \"I had no idea you felt so strongly abou t this.\" Khrushchev: \"Americans are filthy capitalist war mo ngers.\" Stevenson: \"That's a point I hadn't fully appreciat ed.\" What Mr. Stevenson apparently has failed to underst and is that when dealing with the Communists, every time we move the traffic of man an inch away from the point of collision the Communists then move the point of collision back an inch closer to the traffic of man. In other words, every time we appease them in hopes that they will now stop actin g like Communists, they merely consolidate the gain we have granted them and then press forward fo r more. In any contest, if one of the parties is willing to fight if necessary to win, and the other states in advance that, not only is fighting unthinkable, but also that he has no intention of trying to win , can there be any doubt as to which will triumph? On November 12, 1951, General Matthew Ridgway submi tted to the United Nations a report stating that about eight thousand UN military personnel had been killed by North Korean forces--many of"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"them defenseless prisoners of war. 24 It was revealed that most of these had been Americ an soldiers who were shot in the back of the head and dumped in to mass graves. Many were tortured until they died a merciful death. In some instances, gasoline was poured upon the wounded men and then ignited by hand grenades. When the United Nations G eneral Assembly finally got around to passing a rather weak resolution condemning such practices, it even avoided coming right out and saying that the Communists had been guilty of any of them. Yet, in spite of the watered-down tone of the resolution, sixteen countries either refused to sup port it or actually voted against it. 25 General Mark Clark reported there was solid evidenc e that after the fighting had stopped in Korea and after the prisoner exchange had been completed, the Communists still held 944 American soldiers believed to be alive. 26 United States officials who sent these boys into b attle in the first place made no formal protest and took no action to obtain their release; nor was anything said about the matter by the advocates of justice and human rights at the United Nations. Finally, the Chinese Communists themselves brought the issue to public a ttention by announcing that eleven American airmen captured in January of 1953 bad been sentenc ed as spies. The Eisenhower Administration acted in its usual manner and courageously submitte d the fate of these American boys to the United Nations. On December 10, 1954, the General Assembly passed a resolution against the detention of the eleven Americans and called on the Secretary-Ge neral to intercede on our behalf to see if he could persuade the Chinese Reds to live up to their treaty agreements. Dag Hammarskjold traveled to Red China to plead for the release of American m ilitary men being held illegally by a Government that Hammarskjold was doing everything possible to have admitted to the United Nations. It was a perfunctory visit at best. He did not even ask to s ee the captives or to survey the conditions under which they were imprisoned. Needless to say, his mi ssion was unsuccessful. The following year the Red Chinese \"magnanimously r eleased the flyers as a propaganda wedge to be used at the opening sessions of a series of disc ussions with the United States in Geneva. Instead of pointing out that these flyers never should have been detained in the first place or demanding the immediate release of the hundreds of other American s known to be still rotting in Red prison camps, United States officials hailed the move as a gestur e of good will and spoke glowingly of the future prospects of easing world tensions. What has happened to Americans? While Khrushchev bo asts, \"We spit in their faces, and they call it dew,\" Adlai Stevenson says, \"We must get used to it --we who suffer from having had things our way for so long.\" 27 While Communists around the world shout at the top of their lungs that they are the wave of the future, Walt Rostow, the special assist ant to former President Kennedy for national security affairs, proclaims: \"The role of the Unite d States in determining, the outcome of the world's history over coming decades will, of course, be mar ginal, and success cannot be assured.\" 28 What kind of insane urge for self-destruction promp ted an American UNICEF official to say: \"By working through UNICEF, the U.S. removes the possib ility of criticism for any self-seeking ends. UNICEF itself is permitted to take the credit for t he accomplishment.\" 29 Likewise, at the second general conference of UNESCO, an American delegate took the floor and said: I may say for the delegates of the United States an d for the National Commission in the United States, of which Mr. [Milton] Eisenho wer is Chairman, that the constant effort of each individual is t o discover and to determine what is best for UNESCO. The question we ask ourselves is never \"Wha t is best for the United States?\" but \"What is best for UNESCO?\" 30 In 1904 a naturalized American citizen by the name of Ion Perdicaris was taken as hostage in Morocco by a lawless Arab brigand named Raisuli, an d held for ransom. The sultan, Abdal-Aziz IV, was apparently not too concerned over the incident. President Theodore Roosevelt immediately sent a U.S. warship to Morocco and delivered a message t o the sultan that was both short and to the"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"point. It read: \"Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead!\" Within a very short time Perdicaris was safely abo ard the U.S. warship. Fifty-four years later a similar situation arose. I n Cuba a bearded bandit by the name of Fidel Castro kidnapped not one but forty-five American citizens, including sailors and marines from the nearby United States naval base at Guantanamo. In this cas e, however, President Eisenhower sent no telegrams nor did he dispatch any warships to pick up our captured citizens. The United States Government, in fact, did nothing, for under our com mitment to the United Nations Charter, such an act would have been illegal. In 1904 we had not invented the nuclear bomb and we had not sent over 100 billion dollars of foreign aid around the world. Nevertheless, at that time th e American flag and the citizens who gave it allegiance commanded and received respect and admir ation everywhere. Today, it is not unusual for Americans to receive instead the jeers and taunts o f the rest of the world. Our embassies have been burned, our officials have been spat upon, and in t he capitals of the world \"Yankee, go home\" is chanted in the streets. What better proof could the re be of the wisdom of General MacArthur's words: \"There is no substitute for victory.\" NOTES 1.

The United States did submit periodic reports to the United Nations on the conduct of the fighting in Korea, bu t these reports contained no classified information and were limited to a factual chronicle of events.\" Incredible as it may seem, the State Department was asking the American people to believe that the UN had absolutely nothing to do with either plannin g, directing or influencing its own war in Korea! However, General George Marshall admitted that the \"hot pursuit\" policy of the United States of allowing our pilots to pursue attacking enemy aircr aft back into their own territory had been abandoned because this policy failed to receive sup port in the UN. Secretary of State Dean Acheson further revealed: \"There have been resolutions of t he General Assembly which make clear the course that the General Assembly thinks wise; and the Unit ed States is endeavoring to follow the course which has tremendous international support and is n ot contemplating taking unilateral steps of its own.\" It is clear that while the United States was theore tically responsible for the military direction of t he \"unified command\" in Korea, in reality we were goin g along with whatever the United Nations decided.

Patrick Henry, March 1775 We have only to awake and snap the Lilliputian cord s with which they have been entangling us during the first sleep which succeeded our labors. Thomas Jefferson, 1796 CHAPTER FIFTEEN: THE SILKEN THREAD In the story Gulliver's Travels, we all recall the way in which the tiny Lilliputian s succeeded in rendering Gulliver powerless until they were sure h e could be trusted. When they found him unconscious after being washed up on the beach, the y immediately set out to bind him down with what to them was heavy rope but was to Gulliver onl y the finest of silken thread. The Lilliputians worked frantically through the night knowing that t hey had to finish their job before the morning sun rose to awaken the giant from his slumber. When Gul liver finally came to, he found himself entirely helpless and unable to move even a finger. The thre ad, which he could have easily broken at any one place, had been carefully wrapped around his body thousands of times and was more than his match. For the past two decades the United States, the gia nt among all the world powers, has been lying semi-conscious while lesser forces bind him hand an d foot with thousands of strands of silken thread. Throughout these years he has, bit by bit, allowed himself to become entangled in every conceivable kind of agreement, commitment and treaty--any one of which would not be disastrous by itself, but the sum of which is rapidly adding up to total capt ure. At the present time, there are 113 member states in the United Nations. Over fifty percent of these have a combined population of less than the United States! Many, li ke Iceland with a population of 200,000, would be hard pressed to rate even as one of our congressional districts. There are 56 members whose, population is less than that of metr opolitan Detroit. It is possible to get a majority in the General Assembly from nations that between them selves contribute less than seven percent of the annual budget. 1 And most of even that seven percent was first give n to them as foreign aid by the United States. When the Charter was submitted to the Senate for ra tification in 1945, there were only two portions which received much publicity: the opening sentence of the Preamble, which proclaimed \"To save succeeding generations from the scourge of war . . . ,\" and the seventh paragraph of Article 2 which states \"Nothing contained in the present Charter sh all authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic j urisdiction of any state or shall require the members to submit to such settlement under the pres ent Charter.\" It is extremely doubtful that the Charter would have been ratified had it not been fo r this latter guarantee that other nations could no t use the United Nations to meddle in our private aff airs. But, as Americans were later to find out, there is nothing that the UN considers to be \"essentially within th e domestic jurisdiction\" of America. This became obvious around 1949. Mr. Levi Carneiro, writing that year in the UNESCO Symposium on Human Rights, stated: 'Relations between states are based on the assumption that the internal policies of each nation are the concern of all nati ons.\" 2 Mr. Moses Moskowitz, a noted internationalist, made the following statement in the American Bar Association Journal in April of the same year: \"Once a matter has become, in one way or another, t he subject of regulation by the UN, be it by resolution of the General Assembly or by convention between member states at the instance of the UN, that subject ceases to be a matter of being 'es sentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the member states.’\" By the following year, 1950, our S tate Department under Dean Acheson was saying the same thing. In September it issued a formal pol icy statement with a foreword by President"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Truman which read: \"There is now no longer any real difference between domestic and foreign affairs.\" 3 And on May 22, 1959, while speaking before the stu dents at St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland, President Eisenhower said: \"Fo r us indeed there are no longer 'foreign affairs' and 'foreign policy.' Since such affairs belong to and affect the entire world, they are essentially l ocal affairs for every nation, including our own.\" 4 A clear example of what far-reaching, implications are carried with this philosophy was provided on August 7, 1963, when the Security Council voted nin e to nothing in favor of a resolution taking action against South Africa for its policy of racial segre gation. Regardless of how we may feel about racial segregation in South Africa, it is definitely the i nternal or domestic affair of that country. Neverth eless, the United Nations took it upon itself to impose an arms embargo and other sanctions under the justification that racial segregation in South Afri ca was somehow \"seriously disturbing international peace and security\"! The attitude of the UN was exp ressed during the debates by Carlos Alfredo Bernardes of Brazil who said that the question now was whether to continue to rely on persuasion or to advocate \"more energetic and coercive methods of action.\" Nikolai Fedrinko of the Soviet Union piously described the situation in South Africa as \"a reign of terror and violence\" maintained by \"fascist\" methods. 5 Aside from the fact that South Africa is one of the few remaining prosperous and strongly anti- Communist countries in Africa, there are several in teresting points about this UN resolution. One is the clear and unmistakable violation of the Charter , as we have already mentioned. Another is the slavish way in which the U.S. almost always follows the Soviet lead in such matters. When this question came before the UN on a previous occasion, U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge rose and said: \"An item of this character invites questi ons about the competence of the General Assembly under Article 2, paragraph 7 of the Charter. The U. S. has observed with increasing concern the tendency of the General Assembly to place on its ag enda subjects, the international character of which is doubtful.\" After saying this, Lodge then turned around and voted in favor o f the resolution! That was on September 16, 1953. Ten years later, on August 7, 1963, U.S. Ambassador Stevenson was carrying on the Lodge tradition by voting with the Soviets against South Africa. Since it has been clearly established that America' s domestic affairs are all now international in character and, as such, are subject to United Natio ns jurisdiction, consider what might happen in the not-too-distant future if the Soviet Union should c harge the U.S. with political discrimination becaus e of its laws to limit the activities of the Communis t party in this country. What would the United Nati ons World Court decide? Under the terms of the Charter, we have pledged our selves to promote full employment and social and economic progress for all peoples. If we decide d to stop our foreign aid to India or Communist Poland, and these countries charged that we were no t living up to our Charter obligations, what would the World Court decide? If Fidel Castro charged the United States with thre atening international peace and security by keeping its naval base at Guantanamo, what would th e World Court decide? There are fifteen justices on the World Court. Arti cle 25 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice says that nine judges constitute a quorum for the C ourt to do business, and a majority of the nine can render judgments. This means that five jud ges can determine decisions. The statute also states: \"The Court may, from time to time, form one or more chambers composed of three or more judges, as the Court may determine, for dealing wit h particular categories of cases; for example, labor cases and cases relating to transit and commu nications.\" In other words, in some matters, decisions can be rendered by as few as two justices ! Of the fifteen justices on the United Nations World Court, most come from strongly leftist or Communist countries. The United States is represent ed on this Court by Philip Jessup, whose background with Alger Hiss and the Institute of Pac ific Relations has already been discussed."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"What would the World Court decide? When the United States joined the United Nations, i t automatically became a member of the World Court. But it was not bound by the Court's jurisdic tion unless and until it filed a formal declaration in the form of a Senate ratified treaty. Senator Wayne Morse introduced in the Senate a resolution \"recognizing as compulsory . . . the jurisdiction o f the International Court of Justice in all legal disputes hereafter arising . . . provided that such declaration shall not apply to disputes with regar d to matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the United States.\" [Italics added.] 6 Suspecting that there might be a little difficulty in the future definition of matters \"essentially wi thin the domestic jurisdiction of the United States,\" some o f the senators began to look more cautiously at the whole resolution. Senator Thomas Connally was eager for the U.S. to at least go on record as accepting some jurisdiction of the World Court. Rather than see t he whole issue defeated he proposed a simple amendment to the Morse resolution . It consisted of six words: \"as determined by the United States.\" With this amendment, the resolution passed by a vot e of 62 to 2 on August 2, 1946. As of today, these six words are all that stand bet ween us and complete legal subjection to the whims of fifteen or nine or five or even two men whose le gal backgrounds and personal ideologies may be strongly antipathetic to the free world in general and to the United States in particular. In spite of this, there has been a concerted drive in this country to generate support for the repeal of the Connally Amendment. The basic stratagem behind this drive has been to trick Americans into believing that unless we repeal the amendment we ar e self-judging our own case. This is then supposed to shame us into being big enough and cour ageous enough to openly submit our cases to impartial judgment. This, of course, is an invalid argument since all we are doing is challenging the jurisdiction of the Court to try these cases in the first place. This is a common and ancient practice in American law. Just as we would refuse to submit a m urder case to a traffic court, we have a right to refuse to submit a case involving domestic affairs to an international court. In view of the prevailin g accepted definition of domestic affairs this reserv ation is more important than ever before. Nevertheless, the drive to repeal the Connally Amen dment has been carried forward relentlessly by United Nations devotees under the appealing and att ractive banner of \"World Peace Through World Law.\" Not only has the Communist party pushed hard for repeal, but, unfortunately, so have Eisenhower, Nixon, Kennedy, Stevenson, Rusk and Joh nson. Accepting compulsory jurisdiction of the United Nat ions World Court is just one of the threads that is rapidly binding Uncle Sam into complete helplessnes s. It is, however, one of the most important because many of the others could be untied, in time, without it. Should this one be secured, though, poor Gulliver will not have a chance. The silken thread to which we have been referring a ctually takes the form of international treaties. A s John Foster Dulles, secretary of state, said in 195 2: The treaty- making power is an extraordinary power liable to ab use. Treaties make international law and also they make domestic law. Under our Constitution, treaties become the supreme law of the land. They a re indeed more supreme th an ordinary laws, for congressional laws are invali d if they do not conform to the Constitution, whereas treaty laws can override the Constitution. Treaties, for example, can take powers away from the Congress and give them to the Federal Government or to some international body and they can cut across the rights given the people by the Constitutional Bill of Righ ts. 7 This may come as a shock to those who have harbored the idea that they are protected as American citizens by the Bill of Rights. But, as a result of a series of Supreme Court decisions, it is now ent irely possible for us to enter into a treaty with a forei gn Government or the United Nations which would, as Mr. Dulles said, \"cut across the rights given the p eople by the Constitutional Bill of Rights.\" If the UN Covenant on Human Rights, for instance, should ever receive the support of two thirds of our"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"senators--whether they realized what they were doin g or not--our whole Bill of Rights would be automatically and immediately repealed. It is that simple. Of course, our Founding Fathers, who drafted our Co nstitutional system, never intended for it to be this way. In 1801 Thomas Jefferson wrote: By the general power to make treaties, the Constitu tion must have intended to comprehend only those objects which are usually reg ulated by treaties, and cannot be otherwise regulated. It must h ave meant to except out all those rights reserved to the states; for surely the President an d the Senate cannot do by treaty what the whole government is interdicted fro m doing in any way. 8 This is the view that prevailed for many years in A merica. In 1836, in its decision in the case of New Orleans v. U.S., the Supreme Court pointed out: Th e government of the United States . . . is one of l imited powers. It can exercise authority over no subjects except those that have b een delegated to it. Congress cannot, by legislation, enlarge the federal jurisdi ction, nor can it be enlarged under the treaty-making powers. 9 This concept of limited government is the whole bas is of the American system. By taking the chains off the people and placing them on the government, we established the formula for freedom and enterprise which has made us the envy of the world. While other nations were still laboring under a system where government officials are free to do an ything they claim is in the best interests of all, American leaders had first to consult a meaningful constitution to make sure that their proposals in addition to being \"good\" were also constitutional. And if not, what then? George Washington answered that when he said: If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or modification of the Constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, l et it be corrected by an amendment in the way in which the Constitution desi gnates. But let t here be no change by usurpation; for, though this in one insta nce may be the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which free gove rnments are destroyed. 10 But all that was a long time ago. Today our politic ians tell us that those concepts are out of date an d antiquated; that these modem times demand fresh app roaches and greater flexibility in order to cope with the challenge of the atomic age. Only those wh o have never studied the demagoguery of past ages could accept these as fresh approaches. They m ay sound new, but they are the same worn arguments used to sell dictatorship to the people f rom ancient Rome to Nazi Germany. Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., special assistant to Presi dent Kennedy, said in a speech delivered on February 15, 1962: \"Jefferson is today remote and i rrelevant . . . a figure, not of present concern, b ut of historical curiosity.\" 11 On August 28, 1961, President Kennedy spoke to a ga thering of students at the White House and said: After all, the Constitution was written under entir ely different conditions. It was written during a period of isolation. It was writte n at a time when there were thirteen different units which had to be joined tog ether and w hich, of course, were extremely desirous of limiting the central pow er of the government. That Constitution has served us extremely well, but . . . it has to be made to work today in an entirely different world from the day i n which it was written. 12 "},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"That same year Senator J. William Fulbright, one of the country's most outspoken internationalists, made a speech at Stanford University. Fulbright was less guarded in his choice of words than President Kennedy but expressed the same views when he said: The President is hobbled in his task of leading the American people to consensus and concert ed action by the restrictions of power imposed upon him by a Constitutional system designed for an 18th cen tury agrarian society far removed from the centers of world power. It is impe rative that we break out of the intellectual confines of cherished and t raditional beliefs and open our minds to the possibility that basic changes in our system ma y be essential to meet the requirements of the 20th century. . . . He [the Pre sident] alone among elected officials can rise above parochialism and private p ressure s. He alone in his role as teacher and moral leader can hope to overcome th e excesses and inadequacies of public opinion. . . . 13 Still at it in 1963, Senator Fulbright stated: Government by the people is possible but highly imp robable. . . . The case of Governments by elites is irrefutable insofar as it rests on the need for expert and specialized knowledge. 14 Since the Ten Commandments also date back to an agr arian society, and since they were established not 200 but 3000 years ago, it would be interesting to have the senator's views on the extent to which we must \"break out of the intellect ual confines\" of these \"cherished and traditional beliefs to meet the requirements of the twentieth c entury.\" But Fulbright did not give us the benefit of his wisdom on this subject, nor did he say just whe n this nation under God became dependent upon its leading politicians for moral guidance, or when it was transformed from a government of the people to a government of the elite. It was the year 1920 that marked the beginning of a long chain of events leading up to this present repudiation of our traditional American concept of limited government. It was in that year that the Supreme Court (in Missouri v. Holland ) reversed its previous position and declared that a federal law, which was otherwise unconstitutional, must be consi dered valid if it is in accordance with a treaty. I n one fell swoop, nine men completely undermined our Bill of Rights and all other constitutional safeguards that had been so painstakingly erected b y our Founding Fathers. While many years were to pass before the full impact of this sweeping dec ision was to be felt in our everyday lives, still, the brakes had been released, and the massive machinery of totalitarianism began to inch forward. By 1942 it had gained considerable momentum. So muc h so, in fact, that the concept of supremacy was extended to include not only treaties which mus t be ratified by two thirds of the Senate, but also executive orders, personal agreements and internati onal compacts entered into by the President which do not have to be ratified nor even seen by the Senate or anybody else! In U.S. v. Pink , the Supreme Court ruled: \"A treaty is the 'law of the l and.' . . . Such international compacts and agreements as the Litvinov assignment have similar dignity. . . . State law must yield when it is inconsistent with, or impairs the policy or provisi ons of a treaty, or of an international compact or agreement.\" 15 What this means is that America has now reached the point where it is legally possible for the President to issue orders to enforce some agreement which he himself has made with another government or with the United Nations, and these or ders are absolute and final with no recourse to constitutional safeguards. Recent presidents have not yet dared to exercise mo re than a small fraction of that power, knowing that, legal or not, they would have trouble enforci ng such edicts. Nevertheless, the lever of raw dictatorship is fully operable any time the Chief E xecutive wishes to throw it."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"President Truman tugged at it gently when he commit ted us to war in Korea. Remember when only Congress could declare war and send American boys t o battle? Truman simply changed the name from \"war\" to \"police action\" and issued a decree. He was acting on the authority placed in him, not by the United States Government, but by the United Nations Charter. 16 He pushed at the lever again when he decided to sei ze some steel mills with uniformed soldiers. How many Americans stopped to wonder where the Presiden t got the power to do a thing like that? And how many felt any cause for alarm when he said that he was acting to uphold our commitment to the United Nations and NATO? On February 23, 1954, the late Senator William Jenn er revealed that the machinery had gained even greater forward motion when he declared: The doctrine that the President could ma ke personal agreements was extended to the doctrine that agreements made by any authori zed member of the Government bureaucracy, in the name of the President, had the same effect as those made by the President. . . . Mr. Dulles tells us that 10,000 executi ve agreements have been made pursuant to NATO alone. . . . The United Nations is preparing a series of treaties which operate as dom estic legislation, affecting our citizens in matters on which our Constitution does not permit even the Federal Government t o legislate. They would abolish our Bill of Rights and replace it with a body of state- granted privileges and duties modeled exactly upon the Soviet constitution. 17 At the conclusion of his speech, Senator Jenner urg ed his colleagues to support the Bricker amendment, which was then under discussion in both houses of Congress. The Bricker amendment was a proposed amendment to the Constitution which simply stated that the Bill of Rights and other constitutional provisions were under no circumstanc es to be overridden by any treaty. It was so simple, so logical and so desirable that there seem ed no good reason why the proposal should not receive the enthusiastic support of everyone. The 1 952 Republican platform contained a promise to support the Bricker amendment, and surprisingly eno ugh, even Eisenhower went along with no objections. Then, of course, he was a candidate . After the elections Eisenhower made a complete about face and used the full prestige of his office to oppose the Bricker amendment. He, more than any other man, was responsible for its ultimate def eat. As Marquis Childs reported in the Washington Post : Once the President decided to come down firmly and unequivocally against the Bricker amendment, the outcome of the contest was n ever in doubt. For two thirds of the Senate to vote against the President on such a crucial issue would have been, for all practical purposes, the end of t he Eisenhower Administration. 18 Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, the man who had so brilliantly explained how treaties can cut across our Bill of Rights, was now speaking against the Bricker amendment on behalf of the Eisenhower Administration. He spoke before the Sena te Judiciary Committee on April 6, 1953, and assured those present that the new Administration h ad no intention of doing any of the dangerous things be had previously said could be done through treaty law. 19 In other words, under a Government of such good men as Eisenhower and Dulle s, who needs laws? When the test finally came in the Senate, the Brick er amendment failed to pass by just one vote. It is now doubly interesting to return to the pages of the April 1945 issue of the Communist periodica l Political Affairs and read the ominous prediction: After the Charter is passed at San Francisco, it wi ll have to be approved by two-thirds of the Senate, and this action will establish a weighty precedent for other treaties and agreements still to come. 20 "},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"NOTES 1.

Like fire, it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master. George Washington CHAPTER SIXTEEN: THE DANGEROUS SERVANT In 1816 Thomas Jefferson wrote: The way to have good and safe government is not to trust it all to one, but to divide it among the many, distributing to everyone exactly the functions he is competent to handle. Let the national Government be entrusted with the defense of the nation and its foreign and federal relations ; the state Governments with the civil rights, laws, police and administration of wh at concerns the state generally; the counties with the local concerns of the countie s; and each ward direct the interests within itself. It is by dividing and subd ividing these republics, from the great national one down through all its subordinati ons . . . that all will be done for the best. What has destroyed liberty and the rights of man in every government which has ever existed under the sun? The generaliz ing and concentrating all cares and powers into one body, no matter whether t he autocrats of Russia or France or of the aristocrats of a Venetian senate. 1 Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted wit h government of himself. Can he, then, be trusted with the government of others? Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him? Let history answe r the question. 2 Indeed, history has answered the question; not only the distant histor y to which Jefferson is here referring, but more recent events as well. In the t wo decades that followed the birth of this nation, men and women by the hundreds of thousands migrated here from all over the world, because they knew that here was the land of freedom and opportun ity, where a man could make his own deal with life without being bowed by the oppressive yoke of government directing his daily life. Carl Schurz was one such immigrant, and his words written in 18 53 serve as monumental tribute to the wisdom of such men as Washington and Jefferson: Here in America, you can see daily how little a peo ple needs to be governed. There are governments, but no masters; there are governors, but they are only commissioners, agents. What there is here of great institutions of learning , of churches, of great commercial institutions, lines o f communication, etc., almost always owes its existence, not to official authorit y, but to the spontaneous cooperation of private citizens. Here, you witness the productiveness of freedom. . . . We learn here how superfluous is the action o f governments concerning a multitude of things in which in Europe it is deemed absolutely indispensable; an d how the freedom to do something awakens the desire to do it. 3 All of this, of course, was no mere accident. As we have seen, the men who drafted our Constitution and set the infant nation on its way knew full well what they were doing. They were brilliant scholars of history who had closely studied the factors that led previous nations into misery and slavery. They were determined to spare us the same fate. So when they drafted the Constitution, they inserted, among other things, Article 4, Section 4, which sta tes: \"The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican form of government. . . .\" [Italics added.] This m eans a limited form of government. They knew that the Union would not l ast if the individual states of the Federal Government itself were allowed to become despotic a nd unrestrained. The Constitution further stipulated: \"The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\""},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Compare this with the ideological foundation upon w hich the United Nations is built. Instead of insuring that all member states have limited forms of government, the UN assumes that they have unlimited power over their subjects. The UN is not concerned about the fact that a majority of its members are governments which rule with police-stat e methods. Instead of assuming that any power not specifically mentioned in the Constitution is r eserved to the individual citizens or their smaller governmental units, the United Nations assumes that the Charter is vague and broad enough so as to authorize it to do absolutely everything! This c oncept of unlimited power was made unmistakably clear when the UN World Court declared: Under international law, the organization [UN] must be deemed to have those powers which, though not expressly provided in the Charter are conferred upo n it by necessary implication as being essential to the performance of its duties. 4 As a result, the United Nations has become a profes sional politician's paradise. It is a world forum, world court, world department of education, world w elfare agency, world planning center for industry and commerce, world financial agency, world police force, and anything else anyone might want--or might not want. The bedrock for world socialism upon which the Unit ed Nations is built can be found in Articles 55 and 56 of the Charter. Article 56 states: \"All memb ers pledge themselves to take joint and separate action in cooperation with the Organization for the achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55.\" And the purposes set forth in Article 55 are a s follows: \". . . the United Nations shall promote: (a) higher standards of living, full employment, and co nditions of economic and social progress and development; (b) solutions of international, econom ic, social, health, and related problems; and international cultural and educational cooperation. \" Since the United States is pledged to promote, amon g other things, the health of the world's populations, it would be well to take a look at the UN definition of \"health.\" The constitution of the United Nations World Health Organization states: Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. . . . G overnments have a responsibility for the health of their peoples whic h can be fulfilled only by the provisions of adequate health and social measures. Alger Hiss, one of the original guiding lights of t he UN World Health Organization, expanded the concept even further when he said: . . . it includes not only the more conventional fi elds of activity but also mental health, housing, nutrition, economic or working con ditions, and administrative and social techniques affecting public health. 5 This simply means that the United States is bound b y treaty to uphold its pledge to promote unlimited government meddling around the world; to promote th e very thing against which it fought a revolution two hundred years earlier. Advocates of this Old World concept of unlimited go vernment quite naturally do not call it Old World; they like to think that they have discovered someth ing new. Nor do they call it meddling; they prefer to think of it as \"providing assistance.\" Certainly , they would not want it called socialism; \"nationa l programming\" is the term. Call it what you will, th e end result is still the same. But, of course, this is a study of the UN, not a tr eatise on the relative merits of collectivism versu s individualism. Except as this subject is unavoidabl y implicated in what we have dealt with so far, let us simply summarize the whole issue by saying that socialism and all other manifestations of collectivism (such as fascism, communism, etc.) wou ld be just fine except for two considerations: first, they have never worked (as the saving goes, socialism will work in only two places: Heaven,"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"where they don't need it; and Hell, where they alre ady have it); and secondly, they are immoral. History has proved the first point beyond all doubt , and logic substantiates the second. Using the police-backed power of government to forc e people to perform acts that would be charitable if voluntarily performed, is like the Good Samaritan using a club to intimidate others into helping the poor traveler who had been beaten and r obbed. At the point where he threatens to use force to accomplish what is, in his mind, a noble c ause, he then becomes no better than the original attacker who, for the sake of argument, might have committed the robbery to secure money for what he considered to be a noble cause. This is just a r efined version of saying that the ends justify the means. If we accept that thesis, there is no end to the legalized plunder that will be our lot. Not all of the collectivists at the UN are promotin g their schemes out of ignorance or innocence. Being indifferent to the moral implications, they a lso know full well that their proposals are not lea ding to the kind of workers utopia that they keep predic ting. They know that free enterprise is far more workable and productive than socialism but they wor k tirelessly to promote socialism just the same. Knowing that all collectivist systems must have pla nners and rulers--the elite to run the lives of the rest of us--they hope to be in line for the top job s. Consider the following remarks made by Edward H. Ca rr, writing in the UNESCO Symposium on Human Rights : If the new Declaration of the Rights of Man is to i nclude provisions for social services, for maintenance in childhood, in old age, in inadequacy or in unemployment, it becomes clear that no society ca n guarantee the enjoyment of such rights unless it, in turn, has the right to ca ll upon and direct the productive capacities of the individuals enjoying them. 6 Someone always has to pay for these schemes, of cou rse, and in the United Nations, Uncle Sap . . . er, Sam is elected. In 1953 the General Assembly vo ted to create a special UN fund for world economic development. A few years later, when it wa s learned that this fund would need five billion dollars, and that Americans would be paying approximately se venty percent of the total, Mr. Hans Singer, an Englishman, casually remarked: \"It will be a heavy burden on American taxpayers, but you will just have to manage that. You'll get accustome d to paying the taxes.\" 7 Brock Chisholm, director-general of the United Nati ons World Health Organization, during a speech in 1957 further revealed the prevailing attitude am ong UN socialists when he said that it was \"manifestly absurd\" for a \"very small proportion of the human race\" (he is referring to the U.S., of course) to enjoy a tremendous proportion of the wor ld's natural resources.\" He said that this is \"not a sensible arrangement\" and must not last. 8 Apparently the socialists in our own Government agr ee with this thought, for on February 17, 1961, the State Department delivered the following offici al memorandum to the West German government: We must design formulae which . . . make allowances , as we do in our domestic taxation systems, for the principle that the richer among us shall bear a higher relative burden than the poor . In addition, we must come to recognize a principl e on which the U.S. has acted in the years after the Second World War. That principle is that a sustained accumulation of gold and other international reserves by any one country is disruptive to any inter national community. Especially now when trade is expanding faster than gold production, we must lear n to use our reserves on a communal basis. . . . 9 [Italics added.] On September 20, 1963, international socialists lis tened with delight as President Kennedy addressed the opening session of the United Nations : More than four-fifths of the ent ire UN system can be found today mobilizing the "},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"weapons of science and technology for the United Na tions decade of development. But more, much more, can be done. For example- a world center for health communications under the World Health Or ganization coul d warn of epidemics and of the adverse effects of certain dru gs as well as transmit the results of new experiments and new discoveries. Reg ional research centers could advance our common medical knowledge and trai n new scientists and doctors for new nation s. . . . A worldwide program of conservation could protect the forest and world game preserves now in danger o f extinction-- improve the marine harvest of food from our oceans-- and prevent the contamination of our air and our water by industrial as well as nuclear pollution. And, finally, a worldwide program of farm distribution-- similar to our own nation's \"Food for Peace\" program--could give every hungry child the food he needs.\" 10 At the conclusion of a previous speech by President Kennedy expressing similar views in relation to NATO, Mr. Paul Henri Spaak, leader of the Belgian S ocialist party, exclaimed, \"This is perfect; I have found a successor!\" 11 It should be obvious to any careful observer that t here is no longer even the slightest challenge to socialist doctrine within the United Nations from a ny member nations, including our own. Any wishful thinking we might have entertained to the contrary was certainly eradicated by Secretary-General U Thant. Speaking on April 5, 1963, at Columbia Unive rsity, he said: Not so long ago, there were quite divergent views i n the membership of the UN about the desirability and wisdom for governments t o set targets and adopt national plans or programs. Today . . . there is a broad measure of agreement about the usefulness of projections, planning and p rograming as practical tools for economic and social development, while the cont roversy about the relative merits of private enterprise and p ublic undertakings is transcended by the realization that the most important aim of developm ent is to bring about expansion and change for the benefit of all. 12 Translated into simple, understandable English, Tha nt said that everyone in the UN agrees that socialism is more practical and desirable than free enterprise. The socialistic bias of the UN is clearly revealed on nearly every page of the monthly United Nations Review. One can find reports on UN proceedings dealing with setting prices, production quotas, inventories, stockpiles of raw materials, labor sta ndards, wages and monetary policies. Every conceivable sphere of human economic activity is be ing analyzed and then planned for so that it will come under the ultimate control of the United Natio ns. As the months slip by and as we enter into thousand s of additional treaties, executive orders, and international agreements, the silken thread continu es to be spun around the sleeping giant. The job is so near completion that already there are a multitu de of United Nations regulations that reach right down to the daily lives of American citizens. An ex ample is the International Wheat Conference which actually decrees how much wheat our farmers may sel l in foreign countries and sets the price to be paid for it. The Federal Government enforces these decrees by the authority derived from an international treaty. 13 The International Materials Conference is another e xample. Set up in 1951, its purpose was to clamp down import and export quotas for certain strategic materials such as sulphur, copper, zinc and tungsten. During the Korean War, we found that thes e quotas severely hampered the production of critical war materials and resulted in costly layof fs in some industries. When a subcommittee of the United States Senate looked into the matter, it rep orted: . . . in effect, the International Materials Confer ence, an unauthorized group of persons in other countries, dictated to the Un ited States how much of such "},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"critical materials could be allocated to the United States stockpile. The so- called \"entitlements of consumption\" established by the International Materials Conference created a shortage of critical materials in this country fo r the benefit of foreign powers. . . . When the Senate received this report, it immediatel y withdrew authorization for the use of funds to be used in support of the IMC. The executive departmen t under President Eisenhower, however, completely ignored the action and merely diverted t he funds from other sources for this purpose. The justification used was that the IMC derived its aut hority from an executive agreement, a higher source than Congress, and, as such, must be supported. 14 Some Americans, as they see their country gradually becoming more and more helplessly ensnared in this web of foreign entanglements, seek comfort in the thought that the real power of the United Nations supposedly resides in the Security Council where we have the right to veto anything that we dislike. As long as this is so, they reason, we hav e nothing to fear. But these people are in for a ru de awakening. For one thing, as we have already pointe d out, the Secretariat or full-time staff of the UN wields a dominant influence amounting to virtual effective control from behind the scenes. Aside from that, however, thinking strictly in terms of the th eoretical power structure, it is true that the orig inal setup was supposed to place the authority to wage w ar and other important matters in the hands of the Big Five in the Securitv Council, each with the protection of a veto. The General Assembly was supposed to be merely a world forum where nations c ould express their views and pass harmless resolutions. In fact, it is doubtful that the Ameri can people would have accepted the United Nations on any other basis. But the UN Charter is a remarka ble document and, as we shall see, things are not quite the same today as they were in 1945. As S ecretary of State John Foster Dulles put it: If a situation is arrived at where you can't accomp lish a reasonable fair result through techn ical Charter amendments, it may very well be possib le to agree on procedures which would get a very large part of the desired result. Now it would be much neater and cleaner to do it by Charter amen dment, but if that process is frustrated by the fact that the five permanent members have the veto power on amendments, then other ways could be found. [Italics added.] He said that the United Nations Charter was suffici ently unspecific and flexible to allow evolution in this direction, and concluded that, for this reason \"future generations would be thankful to the men a t San Francisco who had drafted it.\" 15 Trygve Lie expressed the same sentiment when he sa id: . . . there has been a healthy shift in power from the council to the veto- free General Assembly Thus, progress by no means alone d epends upon textual revisions of the Charter. A continued liberal construction of the Charter we now have holds out great promise, and perhaps is the mo re practical way to strengthen the bonds of the world community. 16 This philosophy, of course, is not original with Mr . Dulles or Mr. Lie. Centuries earlier Napoleon wro te: \"A constitution should be short and obscure.\" While the United Nations Charter is anything but short, it certainly is obscure. A smart politician with a flair for legal language could justify almost anyth ing on the basis of its provisions. As Dulles admitted: \"I have never seen any proposal made for collective security with 'teeth' in it, or for 'world governme nt' or for 'world federation,' which could not be c arried out either by the United Nations or under the Unite d Nations Charter.\" 17 What has all this got to do with our veto in the UN ? Simply this: We do not have it any more! When the United Nations called for military action to re pel the Communist invasion of South Korea, technically speaking it was violating the terms of its own Charter. This has never slowed the UN down in the past, but this time the issue was important enough to demand the pretense of legality. The difficulty arose due to the Soviet's absence from t he Security Council. When the United Nations was formed, it was understood that a Big Five failure t o vote was automatically considered a veto. But,"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"due to the \"flexibility\" of the Charter and \"dynami c usage,\" the practice now is that failure to vote does not constitute a veto. At the time of the Korean in vasion, this concept was right in the middle of bei ng \"evolved' and it was no time to put it to the test. Consequently, at the primary insistence of the U.S . a \"unified command\" was established under theoretical American control and a \"uniting for peace\" resolution was introduced before the General Assemb ly, where it passed with little difficulty. The resolution established the following profound chang es in UN procedure: 1. If, due to a veto, the S ecurity Council fails to act in a case of military crisis, the General Assembly can hold an emergency session to t ake up the matter. 2. In such a case, the General Assembly can call on member nations to make available their armed forces for whatever milita ry action the General Assembly may recommend. 18 Here, then, is one more thread. Loss of the veto is no small matter--as even Trygve Lie was forced to admit: \"The Assembly by adopting the Acheson [Uniti ng for Peace] Plan, engineered a profound shift of emergency power from the veto-ridden Security Co uncil to the veto-less General Assembly--a shift the full potentialities of which have still to be r ealized.\" 19 It means that at some future date Uncle Sam will awaken from his long slumber only to find that be is completely at the mercy of a majority vote within a mob of angry Lilliputians screaming for hi s head; and that the harmless world forum that he thought he created has transformed itself into an a ll-powerful world government fully capable of performing the execution. In an apparently calm acceptance of this grim fate for our country, President Lyndon Johnson, nonchalantly stated it this way: \"In a world of 113 nations, 50 of which have had new go vernments in the past three years, the United States must be pre pared for change.\" 20 NOTES 1.

Supreme Court Justice George Sutherland, 1937 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN: POINT OF NO RETURN In the far reaches of the globe, there live tiny ro dent-like creatures called lemmings. They lead a rather solitary life and seem to be well adjusted t o their environment. They look and behave in quite a normal fashion--except for one curious idiosyncrasy . Every once in a while, after several years of unusual prosperity for the lemming clan, they sudde nly get an uncontrollable urge to go for a swim. Almost as though on cue, they come from all the rem ote parts of the terrain and, joining together into one huge army, march relentlessly to the sea. When they get there, they fling themselves into the surf and swim straight out from shore. Days later t he beaches are piled deep with the tiny bodies where the tide has washed them up to decay in the s un. Nothing resembles these lemmings quite so much as t he way we Americans have been stampeding to our own destruction. We have already abandoned t he secure ground of national strength and independence to leap into the boiling waters of int ernationalism. We are swimming straight out to sea as though there were a brighter, more secure paradi se just ahead. But the water gets deeper by the minute, and our strength is beginning to ebb. Soon, even if we change our minds and decide to turn back to shore, it will be too late. We are rapidly approaching the point of no return--disarmament. Almost everyone, of course, is opposed to war--part icularly nuclear war--and we would all like to see the nations of the world throw their weapons on the scrap-heap and live peacefully together. In fact, this has been an ancient desire of noble-minded men since the dawn of history. But does getting rid of one's best weapons prevent war? Unfortunately no t. It merely means that men then fight with their second-best weapons. Or it may mean that one side f ights with its second-best weapons while the other uses superior weapons that everyone thought h ad been destroyed but which had been kept and perfected in secret. It is true that in the past arming has always led t o war; but so has disarming! Remember Pearl Harbor and Korea? As a matter of fact, most wars would nev er have been started but for the aggressor thinking he was sufficiently superior in military f orces to overcome the opposition. A disarmed nation , therefore, is far more likely to be attacked and pl unged into war than one that is armed. This is particularly true in the world of today where inter national Communism is carrying out its avowed program of global conquest. High ranking Soviet mil itary officers who have defected to the West have told us that the Communists are just waiting for us to lower our guard. Nikolai F. Artamanov, for instance, a former Soviet naval captain, testified on September 14, 1960, before the House Committee on Un-American Activities and said that S oviet strategy is based upon a surprise nuclear attack on the U.S. if the Soviet leaders could be a ssured that victory would come at once. 1 Note, however, that the Communists do not want to inflict nuclear devastation on America. They wa nt to capture our great nation intact with all of our skilled labor and productive capacity to feed and support their world slave empire. Nuclear war is a last resort for them, and then only if they are positive of immediate victory. Some people find comfort in this thought; but it is doubtful that they have any idea of what living under Communism is like. They feel that any life--e ven life inside a Communist slave labor camp--is better than risking death under the A-bomb. They ar e willing to send our young men into battle to the four corners of the world to die for their safety a nd freedom here at home, but they are not willing t o risk their own hides for the same cause. Patrick He nry's choice of \"liberty or death\" has now given way to the \"better Red than dead\" motto of San Fran cisco's beatniks--and Washington's, too. As Adlai Stevenson paraphrased it: \"Compared with the stake of survival, every other interest is minor and every other preoccupation petty.\" 2"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"If mere survival has now become more important to A mericans than freedom and all \"other interests\" or \"preoccupations,\" then the men who sacrificed th eir lives at Lexington and Concord, at Valley Forge, at Saipan and Normandy must loath us from th e grave, for we have asked them to die in vain. The truly ironic part about all of this, however, i s that we do not have to choose between being Red o r dead at all. If we wake up and move into action, we can be both alive and free. All we have to do is be realistic about our situation and come to grips with the fact that so long as the Kremlin is dedica ted to world domination, we have no choice but to keep ourselves well armed with the very latest weapons. Strength is the only language the Communis ts understand and it is the only thing that has kept their commissars out of our country so far. That Senator Barry Goldwater is one of the realists who understands these facts of life, is clear from his voting record against disarmament proposals as well as from his following remarks: If an enemy power is bent on conquering you, and pr oposes to turn all of his resources to that end, he is at war with you; and y ou-- unless you contemplate surrender-- are at war with him. Moreover-- unless you contemplate treason-- your objective, like his, will be victory. Not peac e, but victory. . . . Peace, to be sure, is a proper goal for American po licy-- as long as it is understood that peace is not all we seek. For we do not want the peace of surrender. We want a peace in which freedom and jus tice will prevail, and that-- given the nature of Communism-- is a peace in which Soviet power will no longer be in position to threaten us and the rest of the w orld. A tolerable peace, in other words, must follow victory over Communism. We have been . . . years trying to bury that unpleasant fact. It cannot be buried and any foreign policy that ignores it will lead to our extinction as a nation. We do not, of course, want to achieve victory by fo rce of arms. If possible, overt hostilities should always be avoided; especially is this so when a shooting war may cause the death of many millions of people, inc luding our own. But we cannot, for that reason, make the avoidance of a sh ooting war our chief objective. If we do that-- if we tell ourselves that it is more important to avoid shooting than to keep our freedom-- we are committe d to a course that has only one terminal point: Surrender! 3 Everyone knows that the Soviets have always been am ong the most outspoken advocates of disarmament. Unfortunately, too many Americans have taken this at face value and assumed that the motive behind this was an honest desire to spare ma nkind from the horrors of war. But what are the horrors of war? Why, death and destruction, of cour se. Yet, the Communists have perpetrated more death and destruction behind the iron and bamboo cu rtains than most of the wars of history combined. The only difference was that there was no organized opposition. The millions who have been executed did not die in combat, but in concent ration camps. This, of course, is what the Communists mean when they advocate peace--the elimi nation of all opposition to Communism. How sincere are they, then, when they promote disar mament? To answer that question, it is necessary to look back to the year 1928. One of the principles expounded at the Sixth World Congress of the Communist International in that yea r was: \"The disarmament policy of the Soviet Government must be utilized for purposes of agitati on . . . for recruiting sympathizers for the Soviet Union.\" 4 Thirty-three years later, Khrushchev revealed that the Communist strategy in this regard had not changed one iota. Speaking in Moscow on January 6, 1961, he declared that the propaganda effectiveness of promoting a Soviet-inspired peace program was an effective means of wooing the sympathy of the masses behind the banner of Communi sm. He even admitted that the Kremlin's plan"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"was to make the slogan for peace fit hand-in-hand w ith the slogan for Communism. Speaking very candidly, he said: In the eyes of the masses, Communism will appe ar as a force capable of saving mankind from the horrors of modern destructive miss ile- nuclear war, while imperialism [meaning capitalism] is ever more assoc iated in the minds of the masses as a system engendering wars. That is why th e slogan of the strugg le for peace is, as it were, a sputnik [meaning fellow tra veler] of the slogan of the struggle for Communism. What a beautiful strategy this has been. Appealing to the natural desire in all of us for peace, the Communists have been able to enlist literally thous ands of well-meaning Americans into campaigning for disarmament and other Communist objectives. Hou sewives, students, professors and ministers have been enticed into supporting organizations and groups whose platforms read like a page out of the Communist People's World. The Turn Toward Peace movement, for instance, is on e of the largest and best known of these groups. The followi ng is just a partial list of the initiatives recommended in their official program of action: 1. Urge the opening of edi torial columns of U.S. newspapers and magazines to Soviet and Red Chinese writers. 2. Double our financial support to all UN agencies such as UNICEF, UNESCO, etc. 3. Stop all travel curbs on Soviet citizens in the U.S. 4. Invite one thousand Soviet teacher s and journalists to undertake at our expense a three month lecture tour of the U.S. 5. Invite five thousand Soviet \"tourists\" to vacati on at our expense in the U.S. 6. Repeal the Connally Amendment. 7. Admit Red China to the UN. 8. Put the Peace Corps under UN administration. 9. Stop all U.S. nuclear testing even if the Soviet s continue testing. 10. Invite the Soviets to plug into our missile ear ly warning radar svstem. 5 These platforms did not just happen, of course. The y were carefully written by people who knew what they were doing. Both the House Committee on Un-Ame rican Activities and various state investigating committees have reported that known C ommunists have penetrated into key positions within such groups as Women's Strike for Peace, The Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy, and the American Friends Service Committee. 6 The investigators made it very clear that the majo rity of the members of these groups had no idea that they were being used to promote Communist objectives, and probably would not believe it if they were told . Unfortunately, most of them have never even questioned the sincerity of the leaders within the so-called peace movement and fewer still have ever bothered to inform themselves of basic Communist st rategy. Consequently, Gus Hall, head of the Communist party in the United States, is able to bo ast that the peace movements continue to gather force and momentum. He stated quite frankly that th e most active of these have been the Women's Strike for Peace and the Turn Toward Peace groups. He noted that \"there are literally tons of literature for peace distributed in this country; t ons and tons of it!\" 7"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"As pointed out earlier, however, the Communists are agitating in this country for disarmament for a far more important reason than merely fooling a lot of innocent Americans. Going back once again to the statement of principles issued by the Communist Sixth World Congress in 1928, we find: \"The aim of the Soviet proposals is . . . to propagate t he fundamental Marxian postulates that disarmament and the abolition of war are possible only with the fall of Capitalism.\" 8 [Italics added.] Bringing it more up to date, Khrushchev has said: \"The slogan for th e struggle for peace must not contradict the slogan for the struggle for Communism. The struggle for disarmament . . . is an effective struggle against imperialism . . . for restricting its milit ary potentialities.\" 9 And in December 1960 at a Moscow meeting of representatives from all over the world, Communist leaders declared: \"An active, determined Communist struggle\" must be waged to \"fo rce the imperialists into an agreement on general disarmament.\" 10 As we shall see, Washington officialdom was thinkin g along exactly parallel lines and was putting the whole plan into operation just as fast as American public opinion would permit. Speaking in Geneva on July 21, 1955, President Eisenhower said: I have been searching, my- heart and mind for something that I could say here that could convince everyone of the great sincerity of the U.S. in approaching this problem of disar mament. I should address myself for a moment princi pally to the delegates from the Soviet Union. . . . I propos e, therefore, that we take a practical step; that we begin an arrangement very q uickly, as between ourselves, immediately. These steps would incl ude: to give to each other a complete blueprint of our military establishments, from begi nning to end, from one end of our countries to the other; lay out the establishme nts and provide blueprints to each other. Next, to provide within our countries f acili ties for aerial photography to the other country. Likewise, we will make more e asily attainable a comprehensive and effective system of inspection an d disarmament, because what I propose, I assure you, would be but a beginn ing. 11 If that was but a beginning, we got an idea of what may ultimately be in store for us when it was announced a few years later that the Defense Depart ment had authorized several nonprofit scientific agencies to prepare a comprehensive study of the co nditions under which it would be advisable for the U.S. not to retaliate against a surprise nuclear attack. In other words, if it looked as though the Soviets had struck a killing first blow, the plan w ould be to surrender without fighting. They call th is \"strategic\" surrender. 12 Seemingly in keeping with this long range plan, Pre sident Eisenhower proposed a United Nations Atomic Energy Agency which came into existence on O ctober 23, 1956. Three days later, before the Senate even had a chance to legally ratify our part icipation, Eisenhower pledged the United States to give the new agency eleven thousand pounds of urani um 235 and, after that, to match the combined contributions of all other nations put together. Se nator Joseph McCarthy fought hard against Senate ratification of our participation in this agency on the basis that Communists in the United Nations could easily take it over and use it against us. Pr esident Eisenhower assured the Senate that \"the ingenuity of our scientists will provide special sa fe conditions under which such a bank of fissionabl e material can be made essentially immune to a surpri se seizure.\" 13 Since our scientists were unable to prevent the Communists from stealing A-bomb secrets and vital parts from right under our noses, one wonders how Eisenhower thought we were doing to pre vent them from doing the same thing in an international organization in which they are member s and over which we have no control. At any rate, the Senate ratified our commitment on June 18, 1957 , and by the end of October, Communist bloc nations had gained full control of the UN Atomic En ergy Agency. Not only did open Communists quickly capture over one fourth of the positions on the agency's board of directors, but the very top post, that of chairman of the board, was given to D r. Pavel Winckler, a prominent Communist from Czechoslovakia. Eisenhower and the State Department professed to be surprised, indignant and perturbed. 14"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"When President Kennedy came into office, he picked up right where Eisenhower left off. The Soviet deputy foreign minister, Vasily Kuznetsov, had comp lained that no progress toward easing tensions between East and West could be made as long as the U.S. maintained what he called \"provocative\" weapons. He specifically mentioned the manned bombe rs of our Strategic Air Command and our missiles deployed on foreign bases. He suggested th at we scrap these weapons and build up, instead, a system of strictly secondary missiles an d \"conventional\" non-nuclear weapons. President Kennedy's defense message to Congress in 1961 was e xactly along these lines. Among the weapons deleted from the budget that year, and each year thereafter, were the B-70 bomber and the anti-missile missile. We have stopped production of all manned bombers, are systematically putting into mothballs those that we have, and have now rep laced our overseas missiles with Polaris submarines. Commenting on President Kennedy’s proposals, an art icle in the Chicago Sun-Times on March 30, 1961, reported: It is known that large sections of the President's defense message were written explicitly for the consumption of top Russian offic ials. Moreover, on the recommend ation of Charles E. Bohlen, the State Department's leading expert on Russia, certain Communist phraseology was inserted in the message. . . . That much of the defense message was directed to the Sov iet leaders is evident in the fact that Llewellyn E. Thomp son, Jr., ambassador to Russia, was given a special briefing on it. . . . The message will now be forwarded to him in Moscow so he can reassure Soviet officials that the U.S. i s taking care not to produce a \"first strike capability.\" . . . Most of the sess ions [at the White House leading up to the formulation of this policy] were directed by Mr . Kennedy's chief aid, Theodore Sorensen, who repeatedly made it clear that the Pre sident wanted to avoid provocative offensive weapons. 15 Theodore Sorensen was a conscientious objector duri ng the Korean War. 16 As for the Polaris missiles that are now apparently the mainstay of our ability to deter a surprise nuclear attack: how good are they? Mr. Arthur I. Wa skow is the man whom the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency has appointed as the expert to draft further disarmament proposals for the United States. He revealed that in his opinion the Polaris is not a provocative weapon because it is incapable of attacking an enemy's atomic force. Thi s is because the megatonnage of the Polaris missile is too limited to damage hardened missile b ases or to knock out a hidden base with a near miss. Waskow also pointed out that the Polaris, lau nched at sea with all the difficulties of precise a nd accurate aiming that any ship encounters, is incapa ble of direct hits on mobile missiles. He said that in order to avoid turning the Polaris into a provoc ative weapon, the Navy should restrict the number o f its Polaris submarines to no more than 45. Secretar y of Defense McNamara has scheduled construction of a total of 41! 17 As a result of the last series of Soviet underwater tests of the one hundred megaton bomb, it was revealed that underwater shock waves were so great that they could easily damage or destroy a submarine anywhere within hundreds of miles. A few such blasts in waters within striking distance of the relatively short-range Polaris missile could li kely wipe out our entire fleet of submarines deploy ed there. Mr. Paul H. Nitze as assistant secretary of defense delivered a speech in 1960 to a group of business and professional men at Asilomar on California s Mo nterey Peninsula. In his speech, which was sponsored by the 6th U.S. Army, the Western Sea Fro ntier U.S. Navy and the 4th Air Force, Mr. Nitze advocated that we unilaterally reduce our armaments ; that we scrap all our fixed-base bomber and missile bases; that we place our Strategic Air Comm and under NATO direction; and that we inform the United Nations \"that NATO will turn over ultima te power of decision on the use of these systems to the General Assembly of the UN.\" 18"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"When the press reported the substance of these prop osals, alarmed citizens began to write their objections to Washington. Government officials resp onded by tripping all over themselves contradicting each other's assurances and denials. For instance, Dr. Lawrence G. Osborne of Santa Barbara, California, received one reply from the De fense Department stating flatly that a proposal to turn SAC over to NATO was definitely not under cons ideration. Another reply from then Vice- President Lyndon B. Johnson said: \"The proposal tha t the Strategic Air Command be placed under the overall administration and command of NATO is o ne that is being given a great deal of thought and deliberation.\" Mr. Nitze has also recommended that Quemoy and Mats u be turned over to Red China, that we extend diplomatic recognition to Red China, and tha t Red China be admitted to the United Nations. Consequently, President Kennedy appointed him secre tary of the navy. In September of 1961 the State Department finally b rought forth the grand product of its long labor in the form of publication 7277, entitled Freedom From War--The U.S. Program for General and Complete Disarmament. This attractively printed booklet contains the disa rmament proposals that the United States Government submitted to the United Na tions, and outlines in detail the point of no return that is now a reality right before our eyes. The following excerpts speak for themselves: Set forth as the objectives of a program of general and complete disarmament in a peaceful world: (a.) The disbanding of all national armed forces an d the prohibition of their reestablishment in any form whatsoever other than t hose required to preserve internal order and for contributions to a United Na tions peace force; (b.) The elimination from national arsenals of all armaments, including all weapons of mass destruction and the means for their delive ry, other than those required for a United Nations peace force and for m aintaining internal order; (c.) The establishment and effective operation of a n international disarmament organization within the fra mework of the United Nations to insure compliance a t all times with all disarmament obligations. . . . no state would have a military power to chall enge the progressively strengthened UN peace force. . . . Explaining in more detail just what lies behind the rather vague term \"disarmament,\" President Kennedy said that it means: . . . A revolutionary change in the political struc ture of the world; creation of a radically new international system; abandonment of most of the old concepts of national states; development of international institutions that woul d encourage nations to give up much of their national sovereign ty; acceptance without question or reservation of the jurisdiction of the international court; willingness to depend for national security on an international peace force under an immensely changed and strengthened United Nations. 19 Commenting further on these proposals, Walt Rostow, chairman of the State Department policy planning board, wrote: It is a legitimate American national objective to r emove from all nations-- including the U.S.-- the right to use substantial m ilitary force to pursue their own interests. Since this residual right is the root of national sovereignty and the basis for the existence of an international arena of powe r, it is, therefore an American interest to see an end to nationhood as it has been historically defined . 20 [Italics "},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"added.] Adlai Stevenson spelled it out for all to understan d when he said: \"In short, the U.S. program calls f or total elimination of national capacity to make inte rnational war.\" And then, as though inscribing the epitaph on our national tombstone, he added: \"it is presented in dead earnest.\" 21 The same month that the State Department submitted the U.S. proposal for complete disarmament to the United Nations, Congress passed the necessary l egislation authorizing the President to carry out all the terms of the proposal. The so-called safegu ard in the act was that no disarmament steps could be taken \"except pursuant to the treaty-making powe r of the President,\" which, as we have seen, poses no limitations at all. And so the U.S. Arms C ontrol and Disarmament Agency was created and empowered to enter into whatever disarmament agreem ents it desired, even without congressional consent. After the newly created agency began to sw ing into action, several of the congressmen who had voted for it began to wake up to the insidious nature of the whole scheme. Congressman William Bray, for instance, said: Many of us, including myself, had great hopes for t he future of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency when we voted for the author ization and appropriations for its operation. After observing t he operation of this agency for one year, I am deeply disappointed. Instead of work ing on plans to represent the interests o f America and the free world in disarmament plans, this agency has apparently been studying reasons for the free world to surrender to the Kremlin to avoid the strife and turmoil that is inherent in freedom. 22 In 1963 there was a great deal of excitement about the Moscow Test Ban Treaty. Military men testified that such a treaty would seriously hamper our ability to keep abreast of recent Soviet weapon advances. The Senate Armed Services Prepared ness Subcommittee issued a report stating that such a test ban treaty would \"result in seriou s and perhaps formidable military and technical disadvantages.\" 23 The treaty was ratified, nevertheless, on the stre ngth of so-called political advantages which were never clearly defined. The truly amazing part of it was that there was so much widespread public opposition to the treaty. There should have been, of course, but it was inter esting to see such universal concern and alarm over a test ban treaty that was nothing compared to the far more disastrous steps that had already been taken, and were still being taken at that very time. Here, the American people were getting all excited over the possibility of a Communist militar y superiority , while still continuing to support policies leading to a Communist military monopoly ! What difference does it make whether our missiles are as good as theirs if they have control of them both? This being the case, it was puzzling at first to un derstand why both Washington and Moscow were pushing so hard for this particular treaty. Was it to divert attention away from the more sinister disarmament measures now being taken? Was it to fur ther reinforce the false image that our greatest danger is from outside military attack rather than from internal subversion? Or was it primarily a propaganda weapon for the Soviets to use showing th at the United States is now so fearful of the military superiority of Communism that it was willi ng to travel to Moscow and sign a treaty which was clearly to its military disadvantage? All of these purposes played a part, of course, but the most important feature of the entire treaty wa s one which received practically no public attention or concern. Buried deep within the terminology of the treaty was a phrase that took disarmament out o f the proposal stage and put it in the commitment stage. When the Senate ratified the treaty it creat ed a \"supreme law of the land\" which now binds the U.S., in the words of the treaty itself, to \"the speediest possible achievement of an agreement on g eneral and complete disarmament under strict intern ational control in accordance with the objectives of the United Nations.\""},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The true significance of the Moscow Test Ban Treaty , therefore, was simply to take us one more very important step closer to the ultimate transfer of o ur nuclear weapons to the United Nations. The first step was our formal proposal to the UN in 1961. The second was the passing of th e Arms Control and Disarmament Act, which made it legally possible . The third step, the Moscow Test Ban Treaty, has committed us to carry out the plan. All that is now left is to do it. Nothing else stands in the way. Without consulting Congress or the Senate, the Pres ident and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency can surrender our weapons whenever they wish . And so, on September 20, 1963, President Kennedy ad dressed the UN and said: Two years ago, I told this body that the United Sta tes had proposed and was willing to sign a limited test ban treaty. Today that treaty has been signed. It will not put an end to war. It will not remove basic con flicts. It will not secure freedom for all. But it can be a lever. As Archimedes, in e xplaining the principle of the lever, was said to have declared to his friends: \"G ive me a place where I can stand-- and I shall move the world.\" 24 Exactly four months later, on January 21, 1964, Pre sident Lyndon Johnson spoke over nationwide radio and television and, parroting the sentiments of his predecessor, said: This morning in Geneva, Switzerland, the eighteen n ation committee on disarmament resumed its work. T here is only one item on the agenda today of that conference. It is the leading item on the agen da of all mankind, and that one item is peace. . . .We now have a limited nuclear t est ban treaty. We now have an emergency communications link, a \"hot-line\" be tween Washington and Moscow. We now have an agreement in the United Nati ons to keep bombs out of outer space. These are small steps, but they go in the right dir ection, the direction of security and sanity and peace. Now we must go further. . . . The best way to begin disarming is to begin. And we shall hear any plan, go any place, make any plea, and play any part that offers a realistic prospect for peace. 25 For years, the master planners have been telling th e innocent assembly line workers that the UN is only a debating arena, an international forum where world opinion focuses on events of the day. As such, we have been led to believe that there is no way for the UN to legislate or to impose its will o n anybody. Events in Katanga, however, should enable anyone with even a modicum of intelligence to see through that subterfuge. If the UN is successfu l in its present drive to acquire the full control of the complete military apparatus of the United State s, including our nuclear weapons, and our national armies, there will be many more Katangas to come. S ome of them will be on our soil. Special UN forces have already made practice seizur es of American cities. U.S. soldiers, carrying the United Nations flag, and wearing UN armbands, stage d a mock take-over of nine California cities on July 31, 1951. The same occurred in Lampasas, Texas , on April 3, 1952. The same at Watertown, New York, on August 20, 1952. In 1963 the Army anno unced that it was conducting similar exercises in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Wha t are they practicing for? The point of no return is here now ! If we cross it, we will find ourselves living in a world where the realities of peace are worse than the horrors of wa r; and where the suffering of life is worse than th e agony of death. It will be a world of our own creat ing; and it will be one from which there is no escape. While there is yet a little time, the choice is our s."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"NOTES 1. \"Ex-Russ Navy Man Plan--Sneak Attack Devised by K.,\" Los Angeles Examiner (September 15, 1960), sec. 1, p. 1. 2.

Abraham Lincoln CHAPTER EIGHTEEN: OUR LAST BEST HOPE Before proceeding with a discussion of possible sol utions to this gigantic United Nations dilemma, it seems appropriate to examine the principle argument s so often used by sincere Americans to justify our continued support of the United Nations. These can be the equivalents of mental short circuits in an otherwise logical thinking process--a pre-condit ioned substitute for rational thought. If repeated often enough without challenge, these clichés gradu ally seep their way into the subconscious where they can then command the emotions to their uncriti cal defense. For this reason, let us be sure that we clearly understand the basic flaws and fallacies that lurk behind the most typical clichés. It is our last best hope for peace. This is, without a doubt, the most universal cliché used to defend the United Nations. It takes many forms and subtle variations. It is safe to say that over ninety percent of all pro-UN speeches, magazine articles a nd books hinge around this central theme. Unless we can spot the fallacies, we are completely at their mercy. The first fallacy is clear to anyone who has taken the trouble to follow the UN's action to bring abou t peace in Katanga. There are two kinds of peace. One is the kind that most of us think about when we hear the word--a peace that includes freedom. But, if we define peace as merely the absence of war, then we could be talking about the peace that reigns in a Commun ist slave labor camp. One thing is certain, the wretched souls imprisoned there are no t at war! But would they call it peace? Alfredo Cardinal Ottaviani expressed it well when h e said: While Cain can still massacre Abel without anyone's noticing it; while entire nations a re still held in slavery without anyone coming to t he assistance of the oppressed; while . . . years after the Hungarian re volt, the bloodletting still continues with the condemnation to death of student s, peasants and workers guilty of having loved a free dom that was stamped out by foreign tanks, without the world showing any horror at so great a crime-- while such things persist, it is impossible to speak of a true peace, but only of a consent to a massacre. 1 The second fallacy, however, is far more important. How on earth can an organization promote peace in the world when strategically entrenched within i t is the most aggressive peace-destroying force the world has ever seen? International Communism recogn izes only the principle of brute force. When it was suggested at Teheran that the Pope request Hitl er to guarantee the humane treatment of prisoners, Stalin remarked, \"The Pope? How many div isions does he have?\" 2 Having the Communists sitting in key spots within a so-called peace-keeping force is as logical as having members of the Mafia on a police commissioner's boa rd to prevent crime in Chicago! It is curious to observe how so many people apparen tly grasp this fact when applied to Red China, but fail to apply the same principle to Soviet Russ ia. They become excited over the possibility of admitting Red China to the United Nations, but neve r advocate throwing out the other Communist countries. Former UN Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, as a typical example, once argued that Red China should not be admitted to the United Nations because the organization \"is not a place where the virtuous and the criminal sit side by side.\" 3 Yet, we do sit side by side with the Soviets. According to this kind of logic, either the U.S. is criminal or the Soviets are virtuous! Obviously there can be no peace without order; ther e can be no order without justice; and there can be no justice when the criminal directs the police and judges his own trial. This is why, since the UN was created supposedly to prevent the rise of anoth er world-grasping tyrannical power like Nazism, the equally ruthless and bloodthirsty regime of int ernational Communism has spread at a fantastic"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"pace and has massacred and enslaved more people, br oken more families, destroyed more homes and conquered more land than Hitler even came close to doing. If that is our last best hope for peace, we have lost all semblance of sanity. The UN must be hurting the Communists, otherwise wh y would they rant and rave against it so much? The answer to that one is very simple. They do not oppose the UN at all. The only time they appear to is when it is a public performance before news cameras or at press conferences. These dramatic performances are obviously for propaganda purposes only. What the Communists really think about the United Nations can be seen quite cl early from the glowing praise it receives in the Communist press which is aimed, not at the general public, but at the party members, themselves. But, to answer the question of why they pretend to oppose the UN, one of the best explanations was provided, unintentionally no doubt, by Adlai Steven son when he said: The Soviet Union has attacked the UN, has refused t o pay its share of the Congo expenses, and has laid siege to the institution of the Secretary- General. Thus, as often be fore, the Soviets have pressed their attack at a mo ment when the (UN] Community seems most divided against itself. But, o nce again, that very attack makes the members realize more keenly that they are members of a Community and causes them to draw together. 4 [Italics added.] At least while we're talking we're not shooting. This is really only an extension of the peace cliché. But it is so widely used that it deserves special c onsideration. In addition to all the observations previously made, it should be further noted that th is argument presumes an either-or situation that does not exist. It assumes that we either talk with the Communists or shoot them. Nothing could be further from reality. The best way to get yourself into a barroom brawl with a bunch of thugs is to go into the bar and start talking with them. The smart thing to do is to stay out and mind your own business! The theory that as long as nations are talking over their problems there will not be war sounds fine. Unfortunately, it does not work that way. Americans surely remember what happened on a December morning some years ago while Emperor Hiro Hito's en voys were in Washington-- talking . The UN is merely doing between nations what we did so successfully with our thirteen colonies. This, in essence, is the plea for federalism, and is base d on the idea that the mere act of joining separate political units together into a larger federal enti ty will somehow prevent those units from waging war with each other. The success of our own federal sys tem is most often cited as proof that this theory i s valid. But such an evaluation is a shallow one. Fir st of all, the American Civil War, one of the most bloody in all history, illustrates conclusively tha t the mere federation of governments, even those culturally similar, as in America, does not automat ically prevent war between them. Secondly, we find that true peace quite easily exists between nations which are not federated. As a matter of fact, members of the British Commonwealth of Nations seem ed to get along far more peacefully after the political bonds between them had been relaxed. In o ther words, true peace has absolutely nothing to do with whether separate political units are joined together--except, perhaps, that such a union may create a common military defense sufficiently impre ssive to deter an aggressive attack. But that is peace between the union and outside powers; it has little effect on peace between the units, themselves, which is the substance of the UN argume nt. Peace is the natural result of relationships betwee n groups and cultures which are mutually satisfactory to both sides. These relationships are found with equal ease within or across federal lines. As a matter of fact, they are the same relat ionships that promote peaceful conditions within th e community, the neighborhood, the family itself. Wha t are they? Just stop and think for a moment; if you were marooned on an island with two other peopl e, what relationships between you would be mutually satisfactory enough to prevent you from re sorting to violence in your relationships? Or, to put it the other way around, what would cause you t o break the peace and raise your hand against your partners?"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Obviously, if one or both of the others attempted t o seize your food and shelter, you would fight. The ir reaction to similar efforts on your part would be t he same. If they attempted to take away your freedom, to dictate how you should conduct your aff airs, or tell you what moral and ethical standards you must follow, likewise, you would fight. And if they constantly ridiculed your attire, your manners and your speech, in time you might be sparked into a brawl. The best way to keep the peace on that island is for each one to mind his own business, to respect each other's right to his own property, to respect the other fellow's right to be different (e ven to act in a way that seems foolish or improper, if he wishes), to have compassion for each other's tro ubles and hardships--but to force each other to do nothing! And, to make sure that the others hold to their end of the bargain, each should keep physically strong enough to make any violation of t his code unprofitable' Now, suppose these three got together and decided t o form a political union, to \"federate,\" as it were . Would this really change anything? Suppose they dec lared themselves to be the United Persons, and wrote a charter, and held daily meetings, and passe d resolutions. What then? These superficial ceremonies might be fun for a while, but the minute two of them out-voted t he other, and started \"legally \" to take his food and shelter, limit his freedom, or force him to accept an unwanted standar d of moral conduct, they would be right back where th ey all began. Charter or no charter they would fight. Is it really different between nations? Not at all. The same simple code of conduct applies in all human relationships, large or small. Regardless of the size, be it international or three men on an island, the basic unit is still the human personali ty. Ignore this fact, and any plan is doomed to fai lure. When the thirteen colonies formed our Federal Union , they had two very important factors in their favor, neither of which are present in the United N ations. First, the colonies themselves were all of a similar cultural background. They enjoyed similar l egal systems, they spoke the same language, they shared the similar religious beliefs. They had much in common. The second advantage, and the most important of the two, was that they formed their un ion under a constitution which was designed to prevent any of them, or a majority of them , from forcefully intervening in the affairs of the others. The original federal government was authorized to provi de mutual defense, run a post office, and that was about all. As previously mentioned, however, even t hough we had these powerful forces working in our favor, full scale war did break out at one trag ic point in our history. The peace that followed, of course, was no peace at all, but was only the smoldering resentment and hatred that falls in the wake of any armed conflict . Fortunately, the common ties between North and South, the cultural similarities and the common her itage, have proved through the intervening years to overbalance the differences. And with the gradua l passing away of the (veneration that carried the battle scars, the Union has healed. In the United Nations, there are precious few commo n bonds that could help overcome the clash of cross-purposes that inevitably must arise between g roups with such divergent ethnic, linguistic, legal , religious, cultural and political environments. To add fuel to the fire, the UN concept is one of unlimited governmental power to impose by force a m onolithic set of values and conduct on all groups and individuals whether they like it or not. Far from insuring peace, such conditions can only enhance the chances of war. There is nothing wrong with the basic argument for a world society or a world union of nations. But not just any world federation will do. Otherwise, we should hav e let Hitler conquer us all; that is precisely what he was working toward. In order to w ork, such a one-world system will have to be based on the same rules of conduct, the same princi ples of limited government that we have just outlined. The system will have to be one which, ins tead of using the police-backed force of government decree to cram every human being into a single mold, will set out systematically to reduce even the existing government restrictions on man's freedom. When speaking about the United Nations, however, we are not talking about a United Nations, or some United Nations, or the idea of a United Nations; we are talking about the existing United"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Nations. And any thought that the existing United N ations will bring peace and happiness to this earth is merely the temporary triumph of hope over reason . We don't want to turn back the clock to a period of isolationism, do we? This is two clichés wrapped into one. The first assumes that all change is prog ress. In other words, today is better than yesterda y and tomorrow will be better than today. That is imp lied in the phrase \"turn back the clock.\" In the realm of material things--inventions, gadgets, cons umer products, etc.--this is often a valid observation. But when it comes to human relationshi ps, there can be no such presumption. Change may or may not be an improvement. Each case must st and on its own merits. The word isolationism is the basis of the second cliché; it has become a scare word to intimidate all critics of the United Nations. The so-called isolat ionism of the United States in past years is basica lly a myth. We have never been totally isolated from th e world, either in diplomatic affairs or commerce. On the contrary, American influence and trade have been felt in every region of the globe. Private groups and individuals spread knowledge, business, prosperity, religion and good will throughout every foreign continent. It was not necessary then for America to give up her independence to have contact with other countries. It is not necessary n ow. Yet, in the summer of 1963 a Gallup Poll asked the following question: \"Would it be better for the U.S. to keep independent in world affairs, or to w ork closely with other nations?\" How many people saw through the intellectual decept ion of the presumption that in order to work closely with other nations, we cannot stay independ ent? Apparently not many, for eighty percent of the answers favored \"working closely with other nat ions.\" 5 With the use of such clichés and loaded phrases, ma ny Americans have been led to believe that this country is so strong it can defend and subsidize ha lf the world, while at the same time believing it i s so weak and \"interdependent\" that it cannot survive without pooling its sovereignty and independence with those it must subsidize. If wanting no part of this kind of \"logic\" is isolationism, then it is i ndeed time that it was brought back into vogue. The UN provides a valuable vehicle for contact betw een nations. This may be true, but is it necessary? What is wrong with the traditional metho d of maintaining contact between nations through the use of ambassadors, envoys and a diplom atic corps? The United States has such contacts in all the major capitals of the world. Wh y not use them? In fact the traditional approach is far more likely to produce results than the debatin g arena of the United Nations. Consider what would happen if every time a small spat arose between a h usband and wife they called the entire neighborhood together and took turns airing their c omplaints in front of the whole group. Gone would be any chance of reconciliation. Instead of working out their problems, the ugly necessity of saving face, proving points, and winning popular sympathy would likely drive them further apart. Likewise, public debates in the UN intensify international te nsions. By shouting their grievances at each other, countries allow their differences to assume a magni tude they would otherwise never have reached. Quiet diplomacy is always more conducive to progres s than diplomacy on the stage. Nationalism fosters jealousy, suspicion and hatred of other countries which in turn leads to war. Here again we are dealing with a problem of semantics an d false logic. If we merely substitute the word \"independence\" for \"nationalism,\" this cliché begin s to fall apart right away. We should be desirous of not having men hate each other because they live in another country, but what kind of logic assumes that loving one's own country means hating all othe rs? Why can't we be proud of America as an independent nation, and also have a feeling of brot herhood and respect for other peoples around the world' As a matter of fact, haven't Americans done just that for the past two hundred years? What country has poured out more treasure to other lands , opened its doors to more immigrants, and sent more of its citizens as missionaries, teachers and doctors than ours? Are we now to believe that love of our own country will cause us to hate the people s of other lands? In order for a man to be a good neighbor within his community, he does not have to love other men's wives and children as be does his own."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"We must support the UN because it is working to eli minate the roots of war--ignorance, poverty, hunger, and disease. The fallacy in this argument is the assertion that ignorance, pove rty, hunger and disease are the roots of war. Some of the blood iest wars of history have been fought between nations that were highly educated, affluent and hea lthy. What country hovering on the brink of poverty and disease ever started a major war? How c ould it? To wage war requires armaments and large armies--hardly the products of destitute stat es. As for the thought that low educational standards and lack of international understanding ( whatever the means) are the cause of war, consider the fact that Germany and England were ene mies in two world wars. Yet both have extremely high educational standards, and it would be difficult to name two nations that had a more thorough understanding of each other. There is no challenging the fact that the United Na tions, through its specialized agencies, has done some good--perhaps much good in many areas. Food an d clothing have been distributed to the needy; medical care has been provided for the sick and the lame. But for each child so fed and clothed, for each person relieved of suffering, the UN system is destined to condemn a hundred who can never be reached. When the United States stood for individual freedom rather than government subsidies, it spearheaded a century of life-saving and relief from famine and pestilence that far exceeded anything UNICEF or WHO can ever approach. What America gave was not primarily food, clothing and medicine (although it did give these t hings in large quantities), but rather it provided an example of what could be achieved through a system of economic freedom. It is impossible to uplift the masses of the world through a redistribution of the existing wealth. If every man, woman and child in America gave everything he had but the shirt on his back, the poverty- stricken peoples of the world would hardly notice a change in their misery. There are so many of them and so few of us. But by providing the example , the encouragement and the assistance for these people to follow in our footsteps, they can build their own economies to the point where real and sustained progress is possible. The only way th at the needy of the world will ever be helped, other than with sporadic and temporary measures, is for governments to abandon the futile paternalistic programs which are draining the econo mies of those countries to the point where they cannot flourish. Only when free enterprise is intro duced will the full productive capacity of these ar eas be released so that their people will no longer hav e to worry about nutrition or health. The cause of war is simply the use of force to requ ire a nation or group to accept the dictates of another nation or group. Since the United Nations i s committed to the use of force \"if necessary, in the last resort\" as the cornerstone of its approach to world problems, it can never get at the roots o f war. Instead of scrapping the whole thing, we should reo rganize the UN and use it to our own advantage. The proponents of this idea never explain how we sh ould go about revising an organization in which we have only one vote against 112 who do not want t o revise it. This approach may be less controversial than the \"get US out\" school of thoug ht, but it simply will not work. With what would we replace the UN? This is, perhaps, the greatest cliché of the lot. T he implication that it has to be replaced at all is very seldom ch allenged, even by critics of the UN who consequentl y begin to search for a NATO or a western alliance or organization of free states. This would be like a patient who, upon being told by his doctor that he has a cancer that must be removed, replies, \"Just a minute, doctor. What would you replace it with?\" When something is evil and dangerous it is not nece ssary to find a replacement before getting rid of it. But, in the case of the UN, this is not an enti rely superfluous idea. True, we must get out of the UN whether we replace it with anything or not. But, to be perfectly realistic, when the United States doe s withdraw, the UN will be replaced--but not by NATO. When the UN finally topples, it will be the result of a ground swell of renewed patriotism and a rebir th of the American spirit of victory over tyranny--a r eturn to the traditional American principles which made this country great."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Instead of looking to the rest of the world for col lective security, we will rely on our own strength and vigilance. Instead of trying to finance the expansion of socia lism in every country around the world, we will encourage, by example, the spread of free enterpris e capitalism. Instead of coddling agents of our sworn enemy withi n the top echelons of our own government, we will replace them and their sympathizers with men w ho are loyal only to the United States. And unless this very important first step is taken we are not going to even come close to get ting out of the UN. Until we disconnect this end of the Washington- Moscow \"axis,\" our government will continue to support and promote the UN, as it has from the very beginning. Instead of coexistence with the evil thing called C ommunism, we will direct our energies toward ultimate victory. Instead of continuing to build a welfare-socialist system here at home, we will move once again in the direction of reducing government restrictions on ou r daily lives and, thus, in the direction of increa sing personal freedom. Instead of trying to buy friendship around the world, we will offer the sin cere qualities of mutual respect and good will. American investment abroad b y private citizens and business enterprises will create far more prosperity in foreign lands than fo reign aid ever could; and the commerce that springs from such investment will do more to bring our peop les together than all the Peace Corps and other government programs put together. In short, the United Nations will be replaced with freedom-- freedom for all people, everywhere, to live as they please with no super-government directing them; freedom to succ eed or to fail and to try again; freedom to make mistakes and even to be fool ish in the eyes of others. Americans will, once again, be free to work where they please, employ wh om they please, buy and sell what they please, and, in an infinite number of ways, do what they pl ease-with only one government restriction upon them: that they not interfere with anyone else's ac cess to the same freedom. This is the meaning of a republic; a limited government. This is what we Americans once had unt il the socialists, Communists and other collectivists turn ed back the clock to the ideas that dominated the political systems of the Dark Ages. Many Americans today, thinking that collectivist ideas are new, argue that we must place more and more power into t he hands of the Federal Government so that it will be strong enough to cope with the challenges o f the modern world. But, as Thomas Jefferson stated in 1801: I know, indeed, that some honest men fear that a Re publican government cannot be strong, that this Government is not strong enoug h; but would the honest patriot, in the full tide of a successful experimen t, abandon a government which h as so far kept us free and firm, on the theoretic a nd visionary fear that this government, the world's best hope, may, by possibil ity, want energy to preserve itself? I trust not. I believe this, on the contrar y, the strongest government on earth. 6 As for peace in the world, until all nations follow the concept of limited Government, it is unlikely that universal peace will ever be attained. Unlimited, p ower-grasping governments will always resort to force if they think they can get away with it. But there is no doubt that there can be peace for America. As long as we maintain our military prepar edness, the world's petty despots will leave us alone. 7 To make sure that we do not get caught up in the mi ddle of the endless squabbles between the countries of Europe, Asia and Africa, we must put a n end to the insane practice of trying to entwine our economic and political affairs with those of th e rest of the world."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Let us, then, move the clock forward to that point where we were when this great nation was infused with the only really new political concept the worl d has seen in thousands of years. Let us throw off these Old World ideas and heed the sage advice of t hat true \"modernist,\" George Washington, who told his countrymen: Observe good faith and justice toward all nations. Cultivate peace and harmony with all. Religion and morality enjoin this conduct . And can it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? . . . Against the insid ious wiles of foreign influence-- I conjure you to believe me, fellow citizens-- the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake; since history and experience p rove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican governme nt . . . .

Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why, by interweaving our d estiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor or ca price? The next time you hear someone speak lightly about sovereignty or national independence, remember that this was the one single accomplishmen t of the American Revolution. Our present involvement in the United Nations has put us right back where the shooting began in 1775. The Declaration of Independence states: When in the course of human events, it becomes nece ssary for one people to dissolve the political bonds which have connected t hem with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate a nd equal station to which the laws of nature and nat ure's God entitles them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should decla re the causes which impel them to the separation. . . . It then lists the causes. It is stunning that this bill of grievances and complaints can be justly app lied to the present encroaching tyranny of the United Na tions and, to some extent, our own expanding Federal Government. It speaks of a \"multitude of ne w offices\" and \"swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance\" (taxes); it com plains about being subject to \"a jurisdiction forei gn to our Constitution and unacknowledged by our laws\" (supremacy of the World Court); it deplores \"transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries t o complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous acres and totally unworthy of the head of a civilized nation\" (Katanga). The men who put their signatures to the bottom of t he Declaration of Independence were signing their own potential death warrants. Most of them we re prosperous and comfortably situated with every reason to go along with the existing bureaucr acy. Besides, what chance did inexperienced farmers have against the British Army, at that time the most invincible fighting force in the whole world? If the colonies had been overpowered, as it appeared more than likely they would be, these men who signed the Declaration would have all been banged or shot as traitors. Yet, without hesitation they stood up for what they believed to be right and declared: \". . . and for the support o f this declaration, with a firm reliance on the prote ction of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.\" In signing the Declaration of Independence, John Ad ams turned to his colleagues and spoke these words:"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" If it be the pleasure of Heaven that my country sha ll require the poor offering of my life, the victim shall be ready. But while I do live, let me have a country, or a t least the hope of a country-- and that a free country. But whatever may be our fate, be assured . . . this declaration will stand. It may cost treasure, and it may cost blood; but it will stand, and it will richly c ompensate for both. . . . And live or d ie, survive or perish, I am for the declaration. It is my living sentiment, and, by the blessing of God, it shall be my dying sentiment : independence now, and independence forever! Can it be that modem Americans are not equal to the ir ancestors? Are we not willing, if necessary, to make sacrifices in the cause of freedom? Is it more important to enjoy the temporary comforts of the \"good life,\" the security of a non-controversial so cial status, than to pass on to our children the cherished liberty we ourselves inherited? As Patric k Henry would have replied, \"Forbid it, Almighty God!\" As you read these final words, you must come to a d ecision as to your own reply to these questions. Each man and woman will soon be called upon for his answer. The rapidity of world events will no longer permit us to remain aloof and unaffected by them. Disinterest will no longer purchase a ticket for escape. Tyranny demands unqualified allegiance: We are either for it or against it. There is no middle around. Which will it be, America? NOTES 1.
