Hunt, whose spectacular business success blind ed the public to his brilliant philosophical achievements. It was H.L. Hunt who i nvented the term “The Mistaken” for the self-corrupted members of the new class who now control our world – he might have added that they could also be described as “The Misshapen”, because of their warped and perverted s ense of values. The present work is also an expression of another G reek attitude – gratitude for life. Michael Lekakis introduced this astoundi ng Greek attribute to me some thirty years ago. I describe it as “astounding”, b ecause no one today thinks of being grateful for life. Who can conceive of “grat itude for life” in an existence of eternal and worldwide slavery imposed upon humanity by the minions of the World Order ? In “The Greek Way”, Edith Hamilton says, “Tragedy w as a Greek creation because in Greece thought was free.” We do not hav e tragedy today because of the thought control imposed by the World Order. Instea d, we have “Newspeak” and “doublethink” in the world of 1989. I was privileg ed to sit in on a number conversations between Edith Hamilton and Ezra Pound , in which the conversation was uninhibited and far-reaching – freedom of thoug ht in a federal institution in which one of the talkers was held as a political pr isoner ! Pound describes these talks in “The Cantos”, “And they want to know what we talked about ?

And now let us proceed.” Eustace Mullins, November 1, 1984 Second Foreword PREFACE to the SECOND EDITION of \"WORLD ORDER\" by EUSTACE MULLINS My search for the names and addresses of the secret rulers of the world became a mediaeval quest to find the Holy Grail which would fling open the doors of freedom for the oppressed and betrayed peoples of t he world, particularly those in my own country. These World Order minions fear expo sure more than they fear armed force or a legal system which would punish th em for their crimes against humanity. I discovered that the hidden manipulators of the Wo rld Order had maintained their power by a very simple technique, which I have likened to a masked ball. The masque enables the Gnostics, the K nowing Ones, to identify their freinds and enemies because they alone know who is wearing what costume. It is a"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"masquerade which depends entirely upon disguise, th at is, on things which are not what seem. H.T. Martineau wrote in 1833, in \"Three Ages\", 1.1 \"A troop of gentlemen, whose country could not be divined from their complexions, since each wore a mask.\" Persons whose country cannot be divin ed from their complexions - bandits wore a mask to prevent their victims from i dentifying them. The bandits of the World Order have succedded in ro bbing the whole world through the technique of the bal masque, the disgui se which enables them to carry on their Satanic work without being identified and prosecuted. The bal masque is the ideal vehicle for this program, because the Wor ld Order gained its present power in Europe of the nineteenth century. It was a truism among the old European aristocracy that \"Balls are given for thos e who are not invited\". The guest attend because of duty or career, to spend an evening in the company of boring persons when they would much rather be elsew here. the reward of being a guest at a bal masque is to be one of the Knowing O nes, those who know which masque hid the face of the King, which costume is t hat of the Grand Vizier. The other guests never knew whether they were talking t o a mere coutier, or to a powerful personage. The masses, with their faces pr essed against the windows of ythe ballroom, know none of the celebrants, and wil l never know. This is the technique of the World Order, to be masked in myste ry, with its hierarchy protected by their anonymity and their masks, so th at those who revolt will strike out against the wrong targets, insignificant offici als who are expendable. The World Order record is one of horror, as the gho sts of the massacred billions cry out for retribution. Its true nature i s described by that master of the macabre, Edgar Allan Poe, in \"The Masque of the Red Death\". \"While the pestilence raged most furiously abroad, the Prince Prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusu al magnificence... And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death. He had come like a thief in the night. And one by one dropped the revelers in the b lood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died each in the despairing posture of h is fall. And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over al l.\" What Poe depicts is what is"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"actually happening to the present world under the m inistrations and conspiracies of the World Order - increasing pollution, disease and famine ending in worldwide desolation and the disappearance of our species. Wh at is the alternative ? We can survive by ripping the mask off the face of the Red Death, and by sending him back to that hell from which he came. God made the earth for living, and we are overdue in our attack on the Brotherhood of Death. We must not be inveigled into more contrived \"wars\" for the profit of the World O rder, nor can we afford to continue to be misled by their control over the med ia, the education process, and our governmental institutions. CHAPTER ONE The Rothschilds In its issue of Dec. 19, 1983, Forbes Magazine note d that “Half of Germany’s top ten banks are Frankfurt based.” The modern world’s financial system, an updating of the Babylonian monetary syst em of taxes and money creation, was perfected in Frankfurt-on-Main, in th e province of Hesse. Mayer Amschel Bauer (later Rothschild) discovered that al though loans to farmers and small businesses could be profitable, the real prof its lay in making loans to governments. Born in Frankfurt in 1743, Mayer Amsc hel married Gutta Schnapper. He served a three year apprenticeship i n Hanover at the Bank of Oppenheim. During this period, he had occasion to be of service to Lt. Gen. Baron von Estorff. Von Estorff was the principal a dviser to Landgrave Frederick II of Hesse, the wealthiest man in Europe. Frederi ck was worth from 70 to 100 million florins, much of it inherited from his fath er, Wilhelm the Eighth, brother of the King of Sweden. Baron von Estorff advised the Landgrave that Mayer Amschel showed an uncanny ability to increase money through his investments. The Landgrave immediately sent for him. At this time, King George III was trying to put dow n the American Rebellion. His troops were being outfought by the hardy Americans, who were"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"accustomed to wilderness battles. Mayer Amschel ar ranged for King George to hire 16,800 sturdy young Hessian soldiers from the Landgrave, a considerable addition to the Hesse’s fortune. This advantageous relationship came to a halt with the sudden death in 1785 of the Landgrave, who was only twenty-five years old. However, Mayer Amschel attained absolute influence over his successor, Elector Wilhelm I, who, like Mayer Amschel, had also been b orn in 1743. It was said that they were like two shoes, so well did they go toget her. It was a pleasant change from Mayer Amschel’s relationship with the former L andgrave, who had been a very difficult and demanding person. In fact, the Landgrave’s sudden death had luckily placed Mayer Amschel in charge of the large st fortune in Europe. As he prospered, Mayer Amschel placed a large red s hield over his door of the house in the Judengasse, which he shared with t he Schiff family. He took the name “Rothschild” from his sign. In 1812, when he died, he left one billion franks to his five sons. The eldest, Anselm, was placed i n charge of the Frankfort bank. He had no children, and the bank was later closed. The second son, Salomon, was sent to Vienna, where he soon took over the banking monopoly formerly shared among five Jewish families, Arnstein, Eskeles, Geym üller, Stein and Sina. The third son, Nathan, founded the London branch, after he ha d profited in some Manchester dealings in textiles and dyestuffs which caused him to be widely feared and hated. Karl, the fourth son, went to Naples, w here he became head of the occult group, the Alta Vendita. The youngest son, James, founded the French branch of the House of Rothschild in Paris. Thus strategically located, the five sons began the ir lucrative operations in government finance. Today, their holdings are conc entrated in the Five Arrows Fund of Curacao, and the Five Arrows Corp. Toronto, Canada. The name is taken from the Rothschild sign of an eagle with five arro ws clutched in its talons, signifying the five sons. The first precept of success in making government l oans lies in “creating a demand”, that is, by taking part in the creation of financial panics, depressions, famines, wars and revolutions. The overwhelming su ccess of the Rothschilds lay in"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"their willingness to do what had to be done. As Fr ederic Morton writes in the Preface to “The Rothschilds”, “For the last one hun dred and fifty years, the history of the House of Rothschild has been to an amazing d egree the backstage history of Western Europe.... Because of their success in maki ng loans not to individuals but to nations, they reaped huge profits.... Someone on ce said that the wealth of Rothschild consists of the bankruptcy of nations.” In “The Empire of the City”, E.C. Knuth says, “The fact that the House of Rothschild made its money in the great crashes of h istory and the great wars of history, the very periods when others lost their mo ney, is beyond question.” On July 8, 1937, the New York Times noted that Prof . Wilhelm, a German historian, had said, “The Rothschilds introduced th e rule of money into European politics. The Rothschilds were the servants of mon ey who undertook the reconstruct the world as an image of money and its functions. Money and the employment of wealth have become the law of Europea n life; we no longer have nations, but economic provinces.” On June 4, 1879, the New York Times noted, “Baron L ionel N. de Rothschild, head of the world famous banking house of Messrs. Rothschild & Co. died at the age of 71. He was son of the late Baro n N.M. Rothschild who founded the house in London in 1808 and died in 1836. His father came to the conclusion that in order to perpetuate the fame and power of t he Rothschilds, which had already become worldwide, it was necessary that the family be kept together, and devoted to the common cause. In order to do this, he proposed that they should intermarry, and form no marital unions outside the family. A council of the heads of the houses was called at Frankfurt in 1826, end the views of Baron Nathan were approved.” In “The Rothschilds: the Financial Rulers of Nation s,” John Reeves writes, “The first occasion in which Nathan assisted the En glish government was in 1819, when he undertook the loan of $60 million; from 18 18-1832 Nathan issued eight other loans totalling $105,400,000; he subsequentl y issued eighteen Government loans totalling $700 million. To the Rothschilds, nothing could have occurred"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"more propitiously than the outbreak of the American revolt and the French Revolution, as the two enabled them to lay the foun dation of the immense wealth they have since acquired. The House of Rothschild was (and is) the ruling power in Europe, for all the political powers were willing t o acknowledge the sway of the great financial Despot, and, like obedient vassals, pay their tribute without murmur.... Its influence was so all-powerful that i t was a saying, no war could be undertaken without the assistance of the Rothschild s. They rose to a position of such power in the political and commercial world th at they became the Dictators of Europe. To the public the archives of the family, which could throw so much light upon history, are a profound secret, a sealed book kept well hidden.” On July 27, 1844, Mazzini said, “Rothschild could b e King of France if he so desired.” The Jewish Encydopedia noted (1909 editi on), “In the year 1848 the Paris house (of Rothschild) was reckoned to be wort h 600,000,000 francs as against 352,000,000 francs held by all the other Paris bank ers.” Prof. Werner Sombart wrote, “The principal loan flo aters of the world, the Rothschilds, were later the first railway kings. T he period of 1820 onwards became the 'Age of the Rothschilds’ so that at the middle of the century it was a common dictum : There is only one power in Europe and tha t is Rothschild.” ( Jews and Modern Capitalism ). Hearst’s Chicago Evening American commented, Dec. 3 , 1923, “The Rothschilds can start or prevent wars. Their word could make or break empires.” Reeves notes, “The fall of Napoleon was the rise of Rothschild.” Napoleon was later slowly poisoned to death with arsenic by a Rothschild agent. They had no need of another “return from exile”. The New York Evening Post noted July 22, 1924, “The Kaiser had to consult Rothschild to find out whether he could dec lare war. Another Rothschild carried out the whole burden of the contlict which overthrew Napoleon.” The Kaiser’s Chancellor, Bethmann-Hollweg, who actu ally precipitated World War I, was a member of the Frankfort banking family, Bethmann, and a cousin of the Rothschilds."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"After the fall of Napoleon, Salomon persuaded the r uler of Austria to issue patents of nobility to the five brothers. The Cong ress of Vienna was the emergence of the moth from its cocoon. The diktat of this Congress was a simple one – the aristocracies of Europe must submit to ou r will, or they are doomed. The death sentence upon the noble lines of Europe w as pronounced by those who had the will to carry out their edict. It took ano ther century to perfect the work, not because the killers were weak, but because they wished to proceed cautiously, without revealing their full strength. In combat, the decisive weapon is the one your opponent does not know about. It was not necessary to pronounce a death sentence upon the ruling families of America, because there were none. During the 19 th century, a few descendants of colonial entrepreneurs had amassed wealth, and c ould afford a life of leisure and travel. They remained slavishly dependent upon Con tinental arbiters in every matter requiring personal taste and judgment. Beca use they had no guiding philosophy, and no program, this American “upper cl ass” never made it to the top of the stairs. They remained “below stairs” as ser vants of the London princes of the World Order. Their self-abasement not only man ifested itself in an unusually high rate of suicide, but also in the slower forms of self-destruction, alcoholism, drug addiction, and homosexuality. Homosexuality i s not so much a type of sexual drive as it is the expression of deeper needs, the desire for self-degradation, or the seeking of a partner whom one can humiliate and deg rade. It could hardly be unexpected that such a “ruling class” would eagerly hail the twentieth century crusade to enthrone Communism as the vehicle of the World Order. In their quest for wealth, the Rothschilds did not overlook either the small farmer or the stockpiling and wholesaling of grain. They developed a “farm loan” system which has been the curse of the farmers for more than a century. R.F. Pettigrew noted in the British Guardian, “This syst em of banking (causing the ultimate ruin of all those who cultivate the soil) was the invention of Lord Overstone, with the assistance of the Rothschilds, bankers of Europe.”"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"One of their greatest triumphs was the successful o utcome of the Rothschilds’ protracted war against the Russian Imp erial Family. The family name of the Romanovs was derived from Roma Nova, New Rom e. It embodied the ancient prophecy that Moscow was to become “the New Rome.” The family originated with Prince Prus, brother of Emperor Aug ust of Rome, who founded Prussia. In 1614, Michael became the first Romanov Czar. After the fall of Napoleon, the Rothschilds turned all their hatred against the Romanovs. In 1825, they poisoned Alexander I; in 1855, they poisoned Nicholas I. Other assassinations followed, culminating on t he night of Nov. 6, 1917, when a dozen Red Guards drove a truck up to the Imperial B ank Building in Moscow. They loaded the Imperial jewel collection and $700 million gold, loot totalling more than a billion dollars. The new regime also confis cated the 150 million acres in Russia personally owned by the Czar. Of equal importance were the enormous cash reserves which the Czar had invested abroad in European and American banks. Th e New York Times stated that the Czar had $5 million in Guaranty Trust, and $1 million in the National City Bank; other authorities stated it was $5 million i n each bank. Between 1905 and 1910 the Czar had sent more than $900 million to be deposited in six leading New York banks, Chase, National City, Guaranty Trust, J .P. Morgan, Hanover, and Manufacturers Trust. These were the principal bank s controlled by the House of Rothschild through their American agents, J.P. Morg an, and Kuhn, Loeb Co. These were also the six New York banks which bought the controlling stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1914. They hav e held control of the stock ever since. The Czar also had $115 million in four English bank s. He had $35 million in the Bank of England, $25 million in Barings, $25 million in Barclays, and $30 million in Lloyd’s Bank. In Paris, the Czar had $1 00 million in Banque de France, and $80 million in the Rothschild Bank of Paris. I n Berlin, he had $132 million in the Mendelsohn Bank, which had long been bankers to Russia. None of these sums has ever been disbursed; at compound interest since 1916, they amount to"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"more than $50 billion. Two claimants later appeare d, a son, Alexis, and a daughter, Anastasia. Despite a great deal of proof substanti ating their claims, Peter Kurth notes in “Anastasia” that “Lord Mountbatten put up the money for court battles against Anastasia. Although he was Empress Alexand ra’s nephew, he was the guiding force behind Anastasia’s opposition.” The Battenbergs, or Mountbattens, were also related to the Rothschild family. They d id not wish to see the Czar’s fortune reclaimed and removed from the Rothschild b anks. Kurth also notes “In a 1959 series on the history o f the great British banks, for example, the Observer of London remarked of Bar ing Brothers, 'The Romanovs were among their most distinguished client s. It is affirmed that Barings still holds a deposit of more than forty million po unds that was left them by the Romanovs. Anthony Sampson editor in chief, said no protests were made. This story is generally considered to be true.” In the early 19th century, the Rothschilds began to consolidate their profits from government loans into various business venture s, which have done very well. Fortuitous trading on the London Stock Exchange aft er Waterloo gave Nathaniel Mayer Rothschild a sizeable portion of the Consols which formed the bulk of the deposits of the Bank of England. Joseph Wechsberg notes in “The Merchant Bankers”, “There is the Sun Alliance life insurance company, most aristocratic of all insurance companies, founded by Nathan Rothschi ld in 1824; Brinco, the British Newfoundland corp., founded by the British and French Rothschilds in 1952; the Anglo-American corp.; Bowater, Rio Tint o and others.” Not only does the bank rate of the Bank of England affect the interest rates in other nations; the price of gold also plays a c rucial role in the monetary affairs of nations, even if they are no longer on the gold standard. The dominant role played by the House of Rothschild in the Bank of En gland is augmented by another peculiar duty of the firm, the daily fixing of the world price of gold. The News Chronicle of Dec. 12, 1938, describes this rit ual : “The story of the gold- fixing has often been told. How every weekday at 1 1 a.m. the representatives of five firms of bullion brokers and one firm of refin ers meet at the office of Messrs."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Rothschild (except on Saturday) and there fix the s terling price of gold. There is, however, a great deal of activity which lies behind his final act – this centralization of the demand for, and the supply of gold in one of fice and the fixing of the price of gold on that basis. A price of gold is first su ggested, probably by the representative of Messrs. Rothschild, who also act s for the Bank of England and the Exchange Equalization Account.” The banking houses privileged to meet with the Roth schilds to set the world price of gold are known as “the Club of Five”. In 1958, they were : N.M. Rothschild, Samuel Montagu, Mocatta and Goldsmid, S harps Pixley, and Johnson, Matthey. In 1961, the London Accepting Houses operating by a pproval of the Governor of the Bank of England were : Barings; B rown, Shipley; Arbuthnot Latham; Wm.

Henry Schroder; and S.G. Warburg. These chosen firms rule the financial est ablishment in “the City” of London. In 1961, the leading business groups in England wer e listed by Wm. M. Clarke as : 1.

For more than a century, a widespread belief has be en deliberately fostered in the United States that the Rothschilds were of l ittle significance in the American financial scene. With this cover, they have been a ble to manipulate political and financial developments in this country to their own advantage. In 1837, the Rothschilds let their American representative, W.L. & M.S. Joseph, go bankrupt in the Crash, while they threw their cash reserves beh ind a newcomer, August Belmont, and their secret representative, George Pe abody of London. Bermingham notes in “Our Crowd”, “In the Panic of 1 837, Belmont was able to perform a service which he would repeat in subseque nt panics, thanks to the hugeness of the Rothschild reservoir of capital, to start out in America operating his own Federal Reserve System.” After 1837, August Belmont (Schönberg) was publicly advertised in the financial press as the American representative of t he Rothschilds. When Belmont participated in a financial operation, everyone kne w that the Rothschilds were involved. When Belmont took no part, and the trans action was handled by J.P. Morgan & Co., and or by Kuhn, Loeb Co., everyone “k new” that the Rothschilds were not involved. George Peabody had established his business in Engl and through his connection with Brown Bros. (now Brown Bros. Harrim an and Brown, Shipley). He had become an unidentified agent for Lord Rothsc hild as early as 1835. Although there is no statue of George Peabody in th e Wall Street area, there is one in London, just opposite the Bank of England. Geor ge Peabody became “the favorite American” of Queen Victoria. His old lunc hbox occupies a prominent place in the London office of Morgan Stanley to thi s day. By 1861, George Peabody had become the largest trader of American s ecurities in the world. To put pressure on the Lincoln government, he began unload ing them and driving prices down. At the same time, J.P. Morgan, allied with M orris Ketchum, was depleting"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"the American gold supply by shipping it to England. He ran the price from $126 ounce to $171 ounce, reaping a good profit, and put ting more financial pressure on the Lincoln government. This was one of many finan cial operations directed by the Rothschilds for their own political and financi al goals. As George Peabody had no son to take over his firm, he took on Junius Mor gan as partner; Junius’ son John Pierpont Morgan, became known as “the most pow erful banker in the world”, although his principal role was to secretly carry out commissions for the House of Rothschild. The New York Times, Oct. 26, 1907, noted in connect ion with J.P. Morgan’s actions during the Panic of 1907, “In conv ersation with the New York Times correspondent, Lord Rothschild paid a high tr ibute to J.P. Morgan for his efforts in the present financial juncture in New Yo rk. ‘He is worthy of his reputation as a great financier and a man of wonder s. His latest action fills one with admiration and respect for him.’ ” This is the only recorded instance when a Rothschil d praised any banker outside of his own family. On March 28, 1932, the New York Times noted, “Londo n : N.M. Victor Rothschild, twenty-one-year-old nephew of Baron Rot hschild, is going to the United States soon to take a post with J.P. Morgan & Co., it was learned tonight. It is usual for progressive British bankers to send th eir young men to western states temporarily, one of the most notable believers in t he practice being the Anglo- American banking house of J. Henry Schroder & Co.” The Morgan-Rothschild connection explains the other wise incomprehensible mystery of why J.P. Morgan, famed as “the most powerful banker in the world”, left such a modest fortune at his death in 1913, a mere $11 million after his debts were secured. Although the present members of the Morgan family seem financially secure, none of them is cou nted among the “big rich”. In “Brandeis, A Free Man’s Life”, Arpheus T. Mason notes, “Young Adolph Brandeis (Justice Brandeis’ father) arrived in New York, travelled for awhile in the East and then went on to the Midwest. Young Brande is’ pleasure and facility in"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"travel were greatly enhanced by the companionship o f a young friend of the Wehles then on a business trip to the United States to sec ure information about American investments for the House of Rothschild. Thanks to his companion’s contacts and letters of introduction, Adolph saw places and met people not accessible to most foreigners.” Bermingham notes in “Our Crowd”, “In the autumn of 1874, Baron Rothschild summoned Isaac Seligman to his office – some $55 million of U.S. Bonds were to be offered by three houses, the House of Seligman, the House of Morgan, and the House of Rothschild.” This was the first time that the Seligmans had been asked to participate in an issue with the Rothschilds. They were more than grateful, and thus another ally of the Rothsch ilds began to operate in America. A notable advantage of J.P. Morgan’s work for the H ouse of Rothschild was the carefully cultivated belief that Morgan, if not openly “anti-Semitic”, avoided participating in operations with Jewish banking fir ms, and that his firm would not hire anyone of Jewish background. It was the same deception which Nathan Mayer Rothschild had hired Morgan’s predecessor, George P eabody, to perform in London. It was a traditional belief on Wall Street that if you wished to deal with a “gentiles only” firm, you went to J.P. Morgan; if you wanted a Jewish firm, there were a number of houses available, but the most inf luential, by far, was Kuhn, Loeb Co. In either case, the customer was never ma de aware that he was dealing with an American representative of the House of Rot hschild. Jacob Schiff, who brought the Kuhn, Loeb firm to it s preeminent role in American finance, was born in the Rothschild house at 148 Judengasse, Frankfort, which the Rothschilds shared with the Schiff family . In 1867, Abraham Kuhn and Solomon Loeb, two Cincinnati dry goods merchants, f ounded the banking house of Kuhn, Loeb. In 1875, Jacob Schiff arrived from Frankfurt to join the firm. He married Therese, Solomon’s daughter. He also broug ht a large amount of Rothschild capital into the firm, enabling it to ex pand tenfold. In 1885, Loeb retired; Jacob Schiff ran the firm from 1885 to 19 20, when he died."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"At no time has the House of Rothschild ever indicat ed publicly that it had any interest in the firm of Kuhn, Loeb Co. George R . Conroy stated in TRUTH magazine, Boston, Dec. 16, 1912, “Mr. Schiff is hea d of the great private banking house of Kuhn, Loeb & Co., which represents the Rot hschild interests on this side of the Atlantic. He has been described as a financ ial strategist and has been for years the financial minister of the great impersona l power known as Standard Oil. He was hand-in-glove with the Harrimans, the Goulds and the Rockefellers in all their railroad enterprises and has become the domin ant power in the railroad and financial world of America.” This is one more revelation of the hidden power of the Rothschild interests in America. Not only has it directed the Rockefell er enterprises from the time that National City Bank of Cleveland, a Rothschild bank, financed the early expansion of Rockefeller, South Improvement Co., which enable d him to crush his competitors through illegal railway rebates, but it has also been the power behind the scenes of the Harriman fortunes (now Brown Brot hers Harriman).

Meanwhile, Paul’s brother, Max War burg, headed the German espionage system; another brother was German comme rcial attache in Stockholm,"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"traditional listening post for warring nations, and Jacob Schiff had two brothers in Germany who were financing the German war effort. It was a classic case of a “managed conflict”, with the Rothschilds manipulati ng both sides from behind the scenes. At the Versailles Peace Conference, Bernar d Baruch was head of the Reparations Commission; Max Warburg, on behalf of Germany, accepted the reparations terms, while Paul Warburg, Thomas Lamon t and other Wall Street bankers advised Wilson and the Dulles brothers on h ow “American” interests should be handled at this all-important diplomatic conference. The Rothschilds had decided upon the formula of a “ managed conflict” for the First World War because of the difficulty they had encountered in defeating the Boers from 1899 to 1901. After illegally annexing the Transvaal in 1881, the British had been turned back with a resounding defeat at Ma juba by Paul Kruger. In 1889, because of the discovery of vast wealth in gold and diamonds in South Africa, the Rothschilds came back to loot the nation with 400,0 00 British soldiers pitted against 30,000 “irregulars”, that is, farmers with rifles, whom the Boers could put into the field. The Boer War was started by Rothsc hild’s agent, Lord Alfred Milner, against the wishes of a majority of the Bri tish people. His plans were aided by another Rothschild agent, Cecil Rhodes, who late r left his entire fortune to the furtherance of the Rothschild program, through the Rhodes Trust, a by no means infrequent denouement among Rothschild agents, and the basis of the entire “foundation” empire today. The British fought a “no prisoners”, scorched earth war, destroying farms, and mercilessly shooting down Boers who tried to su rrender. It was in this war that the institution of “concentration camps” was b rought to the world, as the British rounded up and imprisoned in unsanitary, fe ver-ridden camps anyone thought to be sympathetic to the Boers, including m any women and children, who died by the thousands. This genocidal policy would next be used by the Rothschild-financed Bolsheviks in Russia, who adopt ed the Boer War concept to murder 66 million Russians between 1917 and 1967. There was never any popular"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"reaction to either of these atrocities, because of the control of media which makes discussion of these calamities a taboo subject. The career of Lord Alfred Milner (1854-1925) began when he was a protégé of Sir Evelyn Baring, the first Earl of Cromer, par tner of Baring Bros., bankers, who had been appointed Director General of Accounts in Egypt. Baring was then the financial advisor of the Khedive of Egypt. Sin ce 1864, Milner had been active in the Colonial Society, founded in London in that year. In 1868, it was renamed the Royal Colonial Institute, and was heavily finan ced by Barclays Bank, and by the Barings, Sassoons and Jardine Mathieson, all of who m were active in founding the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank, and who were heavily inter ested in the Asiatic drug traffic. The staff economist of the Royal Colonial Society was Alfred Marshall, founder of the monetarist theory which Milton Fried man now peddles under the aegis of the Hoover Institution and other supposedl y “rightwing” think-tanks. Marshall, through the Oxford Group, became the patr on of Wesley Clair Mitchell, who then taught Burns and Friedman. In 1884, Milner augmented the work of the Royal Col onial Society with an inner group, the Imperial Federation League; both groups now function as the Royal Empire Society. Vladimir Halperin, in “Lord Milner and the Empire”, writes, “It was through Milner and some of his frie nds that the Round Table Group came into being. The Round Table, it should be said, is an authority to this day on all Commonwealth interests.” He states that Milner raised a considerable sum for the work of the Round Table, including 30,0 00 pounds from Lord Astor, 10,000 pounds from Lord Rothschild, 10,000 pounds f rom the Duke of Bedford, and 10,000 pounds from Lord Iveagh. Milner launche d a magazine called the Empire Review, later called the Round Table quarter ly. Halperin also notes another contribution of Milner, “He played an important part in the drafting of the famous Balfour Declarat ion in December of 1917. It is a fact, that, with Balfour, he was its co-author. As far back, as 1915, Milner had realized the need for a Jewish National Home, and h ad never ceased to be warmly in favor of its creation. Milner, like Lloyd Georg e, Amery, and many others, saw"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"that the Jewish National Home could also contribute to the security of the Empire in the Near East.” The Milner Round Table later became the Royal Insti tute of International Affairs-Council on Foreign Relations combine which exercises unopposed control for the World Order over foreign and monetary polic y in both the United States and Great Britain. Milner trained a group of ambit ious young men who became known as his “Kindergarten”. It included John Buch an, future Gov. Gen. of Canada, Geoffrey Dawson, later editor of the Times, and prominent supporter of “appeasement” with the “Cliveden Set” (led by Lord Astor, who owned the Times); Philip Kerr, 11th Marquess, Lord Lothian, the youngest member of the Kindergarten; he served as private secretary to Ll oyd George from 1916-20, and was given credit as largely responsible for the Ger man provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. His Who’s Who goes on to say that he p layed an important part in dealing with India, all dominions, and the United S tates. He was Ambassador to the United States 1935-40, and was a close friend o f Waldorf and Lady Astor; George Jeachim Goschen, a Liberal who was hailed as the greatest Chancellor of the Exchequer, head of the Cunliffe Goschen banking house with Lord Cunliffe, Governor of the Bank of England. Goschen was also chancellor of Oxford and the University of Edinburgh; his brother, Baron Si r Edward Goschen was Ambassador to Berlin when Bethmann-Hollweg told him that the Belgian Treaty was a mere “scrap of paper;” Leopold S. Amery, who had two sons, Leopold, who was executed as a traitor in 1945, and Julian, who married Prime Minister Harold MacMillan’s daughter, and served as leftwing corres pondent on the Spanish Front 1938-9, Churchill’s personal representative to Chia ng Kai-Shek, 1945, Round Table Conference on Malta, 1955, Council of Europe, 1950- 56. The senior Leopold Amery is described as “a passionate advocate of Bri tish imperialism”; he was on the staff of the Times, and wrote a 7 vol. history of the South African War for the Times; served in the Cabinet from 1916-22, MP 1911 -45, first Lord of Admiralty, 1922-24, Secretary of State for India, 1940-45, and arranged for India to have independence. He was a trustee of the Rhodes Trust ."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Milner-Rothschild relationship was described in Terence O’Brien’s biography, “Milner”, p. 97, “Milner went to Paris o n some business with Alhponse de Rothschild.... Business calls in the City includ ed a formal visit to Rothschilds.... weekend with Lord Rothschild at Tring, and visit wi th Edward Cecil, Lord Salisbury at Hatfield.... while spending a weekend with Lord Rothschild at Tring a Press Lord gave him a sleepless night (no further e xplanation given) ..... talks with Rothschild.” Milner attended a Zionist dinner give n by Lord Rothschild, sitting next to Lawrence of Arabia, who interpreted for him in a talk with King Feisal. On p. 364, O’Brien notes, “Milner lost no time in recr eating his links with the City. He went first to Rio Tinto which reelected him to its Board and before long Rothschild asked him to be its chairman.” Rio Tinto was one o f the key firms in the Rothschild empire. Herbert Hoover was also appoint ed a director of Rio Tinto; he would soon be asked to head the “Belgian Relief Commission” which prolonged World War I from 1916 to 1918. The Milner role in starting the South African War i s described in “British Supremacy in South Africa”. Chap. 1 is headed “Sir Alfred Milner’s War,” explained as follows : “On 19 March Chamberlain te legraphed to him, 'The principle object of His Majesty’s Government in Sou th Africa is peace. Nothing but a most flagrant offense would justify the use o f force.’” P. 22, “Milner had come to believe that war with the Transvaal was bot h inevitable and desirable .... Milner had at last convinced Chamberlain that Briti sh supremacy in South Africa would be jeopardized unless the power of the Transv aal was broken.” There is the evidence that Rothschild’s Round Table minion, Miln er, cold-bloodedly precipitated the Boer war for his master’s gain. John Hays Hammond, chief mining engineer for the Ho use of Rothschild, also was sent to South Africa to precipitate the wa r. He formed the “Uitlanders Reform Committee”, with Lionel Phillips, head of go ld and diamond mining firm Eckstein–the Corner House; George Farrar of East R and Property Mines; and Col. Frank Rhodes, brother of Cecil Rhodes. The Co mmittee was financed by Abe Bailey, Solly Joel, Barney Barnato, and the Eckstei ns, all of whom were big winners"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"in the partition of the gold and diamond properties after the war. During this activity, Hammond was arrested by Paul Kruger, sent enced to death for promoting revolution, and was allowed to leave only after pay ing a $100,000 fine; he was then hired by the Guggenheims at $500,000 year salary, a nd in 1921 became chief lobbyist for the Council on Foreign Relations in Wa shington. Like other enterprises with which the Rothschilds h ave been connected, the Bank of England has been a center of international intrigue and espionage since its founding in 1694. Although the Rothschilds did not become associated with the Bank until 1812, when Nathan Mayer Rothschild incre ased his fortune 6500 times by taking advantage of false rumors that somehow sw ept the London Stock Exchange, purporting that England had lost at Water loo. The Bank of England originated in a revolution, when William III, Princ e of Orange, drove King James II from the throne. Since the Bank of England Char ter was granted by William in 1694, there has never been another revolt against t he Crown. The royal family has been secure because the source of money, crucial to a revolution, has remained under control. King Charles II had managed to retain a shaky posit ion because of support from the Duke of Buckingham (George Villiers), and others whose first names formed the word “CABAL”, introducing a new term for intrigue. His successor, James II, tried to placate the powerful lords of En gland, but even his longtime supporters, scenting a change of power, began secre t negotiations with the Prince of Orange. Wilhelm I, Prince of Orange, had been m arried several times, to Anne of Saxony, Charlotte de Bourbon, and Princess de Co ligny. Today, every ruling house of Europe, as well as those out of power, is a direct descendant of King William, including Queen Juliana of the Netherlands , Margaretha, Queen of Denmark, Olaf V of Norway, Gustaf of Sweden, Consta ntine of Greece, Prince Rainier of Monaco, and Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembou rg, whose son married the daughter of C. Douglas Dillon. Lord Shrewsbury (Charles Talbot) had been given pla ces by both Charles II and James II; nevertheless, he played a leading ro le in the revolution. He took"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"12,000 pounds to Holland to support William in 1688 , returned with him, and was made secretary of state. Sidney Godolphin, one of James II’s last adherents, joined with the Duke of Sunderland and the Duchess of Port smouth in correspondence with William prior to his invasion of England, and was appointed head of the treasury by William. Henry Compton, Earl of Northa mpton, and Bishop of London, had been removed by James II; he signed th e invitation to William to come to England; he was reinstated in his ssee in 1688; his son Francis became Lord Privy Seal. John Churchill, first Duke of Mar lborough, had entered into negotiations with the Prince of Orange in Oct. 1687 , and expressed his readiness to support him in Aug. 1688. To allay James II’s susp icions, Marlborough then signed a renewed oath of fidelity to him Nov. 10, 1688. O n Nov. 24, 1688, he joined the forces of William of Orange. Although William had married Mary, the daughter of James II, and had a legitimate claim to the throne of England, he could not take power as long as James II was on the throne. Therefore, he entered Englan d with a force of 10,000 foot soldiers and 4000 horse, a small force with which t o conquer a great kingdom. With him were Churchill, Bentinck, (the first Earl of Portland), Earl of Shrewsbury, and Lord Polwarth, whose descendant is a prominent member of the Anglo- American banking establishment. James II fled to t he court of Louis XIV and was declared abdicated. Marlborough, ancestor of Winston Churchill (whose f ormer daughter-in-law, Pam Harriman, is the leading power in the Democrati c Party) is described in The Captain General, by Ivor Brown, “The Commissioner o f Public Accounts found that the Duke of Marlborough had accepted gifts amo unting to some 60,000 pounds from Antonio Machado and Sir Solomon de Medi na, contractors for bread and wagons for the army abroad, and 2½% of all mone y allotted for payment of troops, some 175,000 pounds (later revised to 350,0 00 pounds).” Marlborough claimed it had all been spent for intelligence, but witnesses testified he could not have spent more than 5000 pounds for this purpose i n all of his campaigns. Donald Chandler’s biography of Marlborough points o ut that “The bread"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"contractors such as Solomon and Moses Medina, Mynhe er Hecop, Solomon Abraham, Vanderkaa and Machado, were for the most p art Spanish or Dutch Jews of varying reliability and venality.” Chandler say s that they consistently gave short weight or added sand to their corn sacks. For a nu mber of years, Medina, as chief army contractor, contributed an annual commission o f 6000 pounds a year to Marlborough as his rateoff on army contracts. In addition to his English supporters, who were pre viously loyal to King James II, William brought with him from Amsterdam t he group of avaricious financiers who were also the suppliers of his armie s. One of his first official acts was the conferring of knighthood on Solomon de Medi na. Machado and Pereira provisioned his armies in Spain and Holland; Medin a supplied Marborough in Flanders; Joseph Cortissot supplied Lord Galway in Spain, and Abraham Prado supplied the British army during the Seven Year War . The most important act of William’s reign was his g ranting of the charter of the Bank of England in 1694, although most of his b iographers omit this salient fact. The concept of a central bank which would ha ve the power of note issue, or issuing money, had already taken hold in Europe. T he Bank of Amsterdam was started in 1609; its members aided William in his conquest of England. The Bank of Hamburg was chartered in 1619; the Bank of Swed en began the practice of issuing notes in 1661. These banks were chartered by financiers whose ancestors had been bankers in Venice and Genoa. As the tide of world power shifted northward in Europe, so did the financiers. The Wa rburgs of Hamburg had begun as the Abraham del Banco family, the largest banker s in Venice. An interesting technique is revealed by the Charter of the Bank of England – it was slipped through as part of a tonnage bill, w hich was later to become a recognized parliamentary technique. The Charter pr ovides that “rates and duties upon tonnage of ships are made security to such per sons as shall voluntarily advance the sum of 1,500,000 pounds towards carryin g on the war against France.” Other European banks, such as the Banks of Genoa, V enice and Amsterdam, were primarily banks of deposit, but the Bank of England began the"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"practice of coining its own credit into money, the beginning of the monetarist movement. The Bank of England soon created a “new class” of moneyed interests in the City, as opposed to the power of the old bar ons, whose fortunes derived from their landholdings. Of the five hundred origi nal stockholders, four hundred and fifty lived in London. This was the dawn of th e preeminence of the “City”, now the world’s leading financial center. For this reason, the Rothschilds identified their key American banks with the code word “City”. Early descriptions of the shareholders of the Bank of England identify them as “a Society of about 1300 persons”. They include d the King and Queen of England, who received shares to the value of 10,000 pounds each; Marlborough, who invested 10,000 pounds – he also invested large sums from his “commissions” in the East India Co. in 1697, and later became Gov ernor of the Hudson Bay Company, which paid a 75% dividend; Lord Shrewsbur y, who invested 10,000 pounds; Godolphin, who invested 7000 pounds – he p redicted that the Bank of England would not only finance trade, but would car ry the burden of her wars, which was proven true in the next three hundred yea rs. Virginia Cowles writes, in “The Great Marlborough”, “England emerged from the war as the dominant force, because the Bank of England’s credit system enabled her to bear the burden of war without undue strain.” Other charter subscribers were William Bentinck, la ter the first Earl of Portland, he had been a page in William of Orange’s household, accompanied William to England in 1670 on his initial visit, ha ndled the delicate negotiations of his marriage with Mary in 1677, and prepared the de tails of William’s invasion of England. He was given the title of Earl of Portlan d, and became the most trusted agent of Williams foreign policy.

Clapham notes th at since 1751 there has been very little trading in Bank of England stock; it h as been very closely held for more than two centuries. The Bank of England has played a prominent role in American history – without it, the United States would not exist. The American colonists considered themselves loyal Englishmen to a man, but when they began to enjoy unequalled prosperity by printing and circulating their own Co lonial scrip, the stockholders of the Bank of England went to George III and informed him that their monopoly of interest-bearing notes in the colonies was at stake . He banned the scrip, with the result that there was an immediate depression in th e commercial life of the Americas. This was the cause of the Rebellion; as Benjamin Franklin pointed out, the little tax on tea, amounting to about a dollar a year per American family, could have been borne, but the colonists could not surviv e the banning of their own money. The Bank of England and the Rothschilds continued t o play a dominant role in the commercial life of the United States, causin g panics and depressions for the"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Rothschilds whenever their officials were instructe d to do so. When the Second Bank of the United States expired in 1836, and Pres ident Jackson refused to renew it, creating great prosperity in the United States when government funds were deposited in other banks, the Rothschilds punished the upstarts by causing the Panic of 1837. As Henry Clews writes, “Twenty-Eigh t Years on Wall Street”, p. 157, “The Panic of 1837 was aggravated by the Bank of England when it in one day threw out all the paper connected with the United S tates.” By refusing to credit American notes and stocks, th e Bank of England created financial panic among the holders of that p aper. The panic enabled Rothschild’s agents, Peabody and Belmont, to reap a fortune in buying up depreciated stocks during the panic. The Bank of England has played a prominent role in wars, revolutions, and espionage, as well as business panics. When Napole on escaped from Elba in 1815, the London gold market jumped overnight from 41b.6d to 5lb.7. The leading buyer was Nathan Mayer Rothschild, who was under or ders from the British Treasury to dispatch gold to the Duke of Wellington , grouping to stop Napoleon. After Waterloo, the price of gold dropped. During the twentieth century, the most important na me at the Bank of England was Lord Montague Norman. His grandfather, George Warde Norman, had been governor of the Bank of England from 1821- 1872, longer than any other man; his other grandfather, Lord Collet, was Gover nor of the Bank of England from 1887-89, and managing partner of Brown Shipley Co. in London for twenty- five years. In 1894, Montague Norman was sent to N ew York to work in the offices of Brown Bros.; he was befriended by the W .A. Delano family, and lived with the Markoe family, partners of Brown Bros. In 1907, Norman was elected to the Court of the Bank of England. In 1912, he had a severe nervous breakdown, and was treated by Jung in Switzerland. He became deputy governor of the Bank of England in 1916, and later served until 1944 as Governor. The Wall Street Journal wrote of him in 1927, “Mr. M. Collet Norman , the Governor of the Bank of England, is now head and shoulders above all oth er British bankers. No other"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"British banker has ever been as independent and sup reme in the world of British finance as Mr. Norman is today.

He runs his Bank and his Treasury as well. He appears to have no associations except his employees. He gives no interviews. He leaves the British financial world wholly in the thick as to his plans and ideas.” The idea that one individual ran the Bank of Englan d to suit himself, with no influences, is too ridiculous to be considered. What about the Rothschilds ? What about the other shareholders ? Carroll Quigle y, in “Tragedy and Hope” notes that “M. Norman said, 'I hold the hegemony of the currency.’– He is called the currency dictator of Europe.” Lionel Fraser of J. Henry Schroder Wagg notes in his autobiography, “All to the Good”, that he wa s in charge of Lord Norman’s personal investments. He also notes of the firm of Helbert Wagg, former jewelers from Halberstadt and now a London banking house (la ter J. Henry Schroder Wagg), “The firm was official brokers on Stock Exch ange to the great and all powerful House of Rothschild.” Both Wagg and Schro der had been in business in London for 159 years when they merged in 1960. Ano ther writer notes that Lord Norman frequently consulted with J.P. Morgan before making his Bank of England decisions. Gordon Richardson, chairman of J.

The idea was not to disarm, but t o persuade the nations to junk what arms they had so they could later be sold new ones. “The merchants of death”, as they were popularly known in those days, were never more than errand boys for their true masters, “the bankers of death” , or, as they were also known, “the Brotherhood of Death”. In 1897, Vickers, in w hich Rothschilds had the largest holding, bought Naval Construction and Arma ment Co., and Maxim Nordenfeldt Guns & Ammunition Co. The new Vickers- Maxim Co. was able to test its products in the Spanish-American War, whic h was set off by J&W Seligman Co. to obtain the white gold, (sugar), of Cuba; th e Boer War of 1899-1901, to seize the gold and diamond fields of the Witwatersrand, a nd the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, designed to weaken the Czar and make the Comm unist Revolution inevitable. These three wars provided the excuse f or tooling up for the mass production of World Wars I & II. In 1897, an inter national power trust was formed, consisting of DuPont, Nobel, Koln, and Kott weiler, which divided the world into four distinct sales territories. The chmn. of Vickers, Sir Herbert Lawrence, was dir ector of Sun Assurance Office Ltd; Sun Life Assurance, and chmn. the Lond on committee of the Ottoman Bank; directors included Sir Otto Niemeyer , director of the Bank of England, and the Anglo International Bank; S.

The highwater mark of “the merchants of death” hoax was reached in the Nye Committee Hearings of 1934, copies of which are invariably missing in government libraries. Alger Hiss was investigator and counsel for the Committee. Typical was Chairman Nye’s questioning of Mr. Carse of the Electric Boat Co. (a subsidiary of Vickers): “Chmn. NYE: In 1917, Mr. Carse, you drafted a letter to help Zaharoff avoid paying income tax on your commi ssions to him of $766,852. There is Exhibit 24, a letter dated Sept. 21, 1917, addressed to Mr. H.C. Sheridan, Washington, D.C. Who is Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Carse ? CARSE: He owns the Hotel Washington. At that time he was the agent of Vicke rs Ltd. in this country, and he was also a representative of Zaharoff. Mr Sheridan handled Mr. Zaharoff’s income tax with White and Case. CHMN: Did you know that this was false, that this omission of a million dollars referred to was actua lly Sir Basil Zaharoff’s income ? CARSE: No, I did not know anything about Zaharoff’ s income. CHMN: But you have told us that a letter by Zaharoff six weeks ea rlier that 82,000 francs he received was his own personal income. CARSE: I do not know what Zaharoff did in his business. He did not tell me. CHMN: Did Z aharoff succeed in escaping the payment of income tax to the United States ? CARSE : I believe there was some settlement made. Sheridan handled it..... Zaharoff was never a stockholder insofar as I ever knew. The men who handle very large stoc k do not put the stock in their own names. CHMN: Zaharoff wrote to you 19 May, 19 25, ’I desire no thanks for what I have done, because I am bound to attend to t he interest of my firm of Vickers and the Electric Boat Co. in both of which I am a stockholder. CARSE: I know he told me that, but I was never able to trace anything.” Sen. Clark then pursued questioning on how the arma ments firms and oil companies promoted wars : “CLARK: So this whole o ccasion of arming Peru, and of the revolution in Bolivia on the basis of ar ming against Chile was based on erroneous rumor ? MR. SPEZAR: That is my impressi on. CLARK: You wanted to interest the large oil companies in financing an armament program for South"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"America. CARSE: I was willing to present any prop osition the government might approve with regard to any oil companies which migh t be interested.” The Nye Committee frequently came back to Zaharoff’ s activities, referring to him as “a kind of superspy in high social and in fluential circles”. For many years he exercised great influence on Prime Minister Lloy d George of England. Zaharoff, who began his career as a brothel tout an d underworld tough, arranged for Lloyd George to have an affair with Zaharoff’s wife. Arthur Maundy Gregory, an associate of Lloyd George, was also a Zaharoff a gent. Maundy Gregory for many years regularly peddled peerages in London clu bs; knighthoods, not hereditary, were 10,000-12,000 lbs.; baronetcies w ent for as high as 40,000 lb., of which he paid Lloyd George a standard 5000 lb. each . Maundy Gregory was also closely associated with Sir Basil Thompson in Briti sh counter-espionage. Zaharoff, who was born in 1851 in Constantinople, married one Emily Ann Burrows of Knightsbridge. Maundy Gregory then introduced Emil y Ann to the insatiable Lloyd George. From that time on, he was at Zaharof f’s mercy. Although Zaharoff was closely associated with Lloyd George throughout World War I until 1922, when their association effectively ended Lloyd Geor ge’s political career, the name Zaharoff appears nowhere in Lloyd George’s extensiv e Memoirs. Lloyd George’s political career came to an end after Zaharoff pers uaded him to help the Greeks against Turkey in 1920, a disastrous adventure whic h brought about Lloyd George’s downfall from political power. George Don ald McCormick, in “The Mask of Merlin”, the definitive work on Lloyd Georg e, states, “Zaharoff kept him (Lloyd George) closely informed on the Balkans. Du ring the war, Zaharoff was sent on various secret missions by Lloyd George. T he Big Three, Wilson, Lloyd George and Clemenceau, met in Zaharoff’s home in Pa ris. On one occasion, Zaharoff went to German (in 1917) on Lloyd George’s personal unstructions, disguised in the uniform of a Bulgarian Army doctor . Clemenceau later said, 'The information which Zaharoff secured in Germany for L loyd George was the most important piece of intelligence of the whole war.’” Zaharoff was awarded the Order of British Empire in 1918 for this mission. McCormick also notes,"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"“Zaharoff had interests in Briey furnaces of the Co mite des Forges. Throughout the war no action was taken against Briey or nearby Thionville, a German area vital to the German army. Orders to bombard Briey were c ancelled on orders of Zaharoff.” M. Barthe protested this event in a spe ech to the French Parliament January 24, 1919. McCormick found that Zaharoff had made some interes ting confessions to close associates. He boasted to Rosita Forbes, “I made wars so that I could sell arms to both sides.” He offered astute political a dvice to Sir Robert Lord Boothby, “Begin on the left in politics, and then, if necess ary, work over to the right. Remember it is sometimes necessary to kick off the ladder those who have helped you to climb it.” In addition to his Vickers and Electric Boat stock, Zaharoff had large holdings in other armaments manufacturers, Krupp an d Skoda. The Skoda Works of Czechoslavakia were controlled by the powerful S chneider family of Schneider- Creusot, headed by Eugene Schneider, whose grand-da ughter married the present Duke of Bedford. The Nye Committee found that Vick ers interlocked with Brown Boveri of Switzerland, Fokker, Banque Ottomane, Mit sui, Schneider, and ten other armaments firms around the world. Vickers set up a torpedo manufacturing firm, Societe Francasies des Torpilles Whitehead, with th e former Whitehead Co., whose owner, James B. Whitehead, then became English Amba ssador to France. Frau Margareta von Bismarck was a director of Societe Fr ancasies, as was Count Edgar Hoyos of Fiume. At its peak in the 1930s, the Vickers network inclu ded Harvey Steel, Chas. Cammell & co. shipbuilding, John Brown & Co., Krupp and Dillinger of Germany, Terni Co. of Italy, Bethehem Steel and Electric Boa t in the U.S., Schneider, Chatillon Steel, Nobel Dynamite Trust, and Chilwort h Gunpowder Co.

Roland Harriman of Brown Bros Harriman was a director."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"As First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill o bligingly changed the fuel of the entire English fleet from coal to oil, as a favor to the Samuel family which owned Royal Dutch Shell. The most revealing works on the armaments dealers, the Nye Committee Hearings, and “Merchants of Death” are now fifty ye ars old. On p. 167 of “Merchants” we find that “The Societe Miniere de Pe narroya controls the most important lead mines of the world, accounting for o ne-eighth of the world’s production. Since 1833 the French bankers, the Rot hschilds, have controlled these mines, but in 1909 the Rothschild Bank entered into an alliance with the Metallgeschaft of Frankfurt, the company in which b oth the Kaiser and Krupp were heavily interested. This company remained und er German and French control for about two years of the war. At the out break of hostilities, 150,000 tons of lead were shipped from these mines to Germany, v ia Switzerland. When shipments to France were resumed, the price was rai sed to such an extent that it more than doubled the price which the English paid for their lead. Free trade between Germany and France in important chemicals, for powder, etc. continued; the Swiss supplied both sides with electric power. All along their frontier great powerhouses sprang into being, facing Germany from Italy, producing iron, bauxite, chemicals and power. Zeiss products were exported to Britain throughout the war.” Dr. Ellis Powell told an audience at Queens Hall, L ondon, March 4, 1917; “At the beginning of the war many thousands of Germ an reservists were allowed to return to Germany although our Fleet could have stopped them. German individuals, firms and companies went on trading me rrily in British names, collecting their debts, and indirectly, no doubt, f inancing German militarism. At the very moment when Germans were destroying our pr operty by Zeppelin bombs we were actually paying them money instead of takin g their holdings as part compensation for damage done.

The unin terrupted activity in this country of the Frankfort Metal Octopus is not an accident . .. Let me analyze one lurid case, which has stirred public indignation and anger to i ts depths. I mean the impudent survival of the German banks. We have now been at war nearly three years. Yet their doors are still open. They sent large quanti ties of bullion to Germany after the war started.” There was a remarkable amount of goodwill and free trade continuing during World War I among the warring nations. Of course t he Americans did not wish to be left out of the great outpouring of goodwill in which forty million people were killed. It was not enough that the Americans were financing the war through their Federal Reserve System and the personal income tax, which, as Cordell Hull so aptly put it in his Memoirs, “had been passed in th e nick of time” before the outbreak of the war; nor was it enough that the Am ericans were feeding the “Belgians”, actually the Germans, through the Belgi an Relief Commission, so that the war could be prolonged until the United States became a belligerent. Concerned Americans dedicated themselves to the pro position that American boys should be killed in the trenches with the British, the French, the Germans and other nationalites. The warmongers set up three principal organizations to force the United States into World War I – the Council on National D efense, the Navy League, and the League to Enforce Peace. The Council on Nation al Defense was authorized by act of Congress August, 1916, although there was no nation on earth known to be contemplating any attack on the United States. Pan cho Villa had led a small group of bandits against Columbus, N.M., but this raid wa s hardly an occasion for national mobilization. It was a retaliatory strike because of the actions of New York bankers in Mexico – the Warburgs held the bond s of the National Railways of Mexico; George F. Peabody and Eugene Meyer and Cleveland H. Dodge owned the copper mines of Mexico; Seligman & Co. owned E lectric Power and Light of Mexico. The Mexican Revolution was an uprising aga inst President Porfirio Diaz, who had collaborated profitably with the Warburgs a nd Rockefellers for years."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Percy N. Furber, president of the Oil Fields of Mex ico Ltd. told C.W. Barron, “The Mexican Revolution was really caused by H. Clay Pie rce, who owned 35% of Pierce-Waters Oil Co.; Standard Oil owned the othe r 65%. He wanted to get my property. He demanded of Diaz that he should take off the taxes on oil imports so that Standard Oil could bring in products from the U.S. Diaz refused.” Furber said that he put up the money for Francisco Madero to oust Diaz. Madero was then murdered by Victoriano Huerta, the pawn of Lor d Cowdray, head of British oil interests in Mexico. In the resulting chaos, V illa and Zapata came to the fore, resulting in the Columbus raid. The Council on National Defense was chaired by Dani el Willard, pres. B&O RR; other members were Bernard Baruch, Julius Rose nwald, Samuel Gompers, Walter S. Gifford, pres. of AT & T, also director C ommission on Industrial Preparedness; Hollis Godfrey, pres. of Drexel Inst itute, married to a Lawrence of Boston; and Howard Coffin, pres. of Hudson Motor C ar Co. Coffin’s secretary, Grosvenor Clarkson, ran the Council. Godfrey claim s in Who’s Who that the Council was actually created by himself, Howard Cof fin and Elihu Root. The principals of the Navy League were J.P. Morgan of U.S. Steel, Charles Schwab of Bethlehem Steel, Col. R.M. Thompson of In ternational Nickel, and B.F. Tracy, attorney for the Carnegie Steel Co. The pri ncipals of the League to Enforce Peace were Elihu Root, J.P. Morgan’s lawyer; Linco ln Filene; Oscar Straus; John Hays Hammond, who had been sentenced to death for r evolutionary activity in South Africa; Isaac Seligman; Perry Belmont, the official representative of the Rothschilds, and Jacob Schiff of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. The watchword of these millionaire bakers was “preparedness”, and Asst. Se c of the Navy Franklin Delano Roosevelt was already letting large Navy contracts in 1916, a year before we got into the war. Col. House wrote to President Wilson from London on May 29, 1914, “Whenever England consents, France and Russia will close in on Germany and Austria.”"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"While preparing for war, Woodrow Wilson campaigned in 1916 on the slogan, “He kept us out of war”. H.C. Peterson not es in “Propaganda for War”, Univ. Oklahoma Press, 1939, “To a large extent, the 9 million people who voted for Wilson did so because of the phrase, ‘He kept u s out of war.’” Col. House later told Viereck that Wilson had concluded an agreement with the British in 1916, long before his campaign, to involve us in the war. Roo sevelt repeated the process in 1939. When we went into World War I, Wilson appointed his campaign fundraiser, Bernard Baruch, head of the War Industries Board. Baruch was later investigated by the Graham Committee. He testified, “I probably had more power than perhaps any other man did in the war; doubtless th at is true.” He said of his prewar actions, “I asked for an interview with the President. I explained to him as earnestly as I could that I was deeply concerned ab out the necessity of the mobilisation of the industries of the country. The President listened very attentively and graciously, as he always does, and the next thing I heard, some months afterward, my attention was brought to this Council of National Defense.” “MR. GRAHAM: Did the President express any opinion about the advisability of adopting the scheme you proposed ? BARUCH: I think I did most of the talking. GRAHAM: Did you impress him with your belief that we were going to get into the war ? BARUCH: I probably di d. GRAHAM: That was your opinion at the time ? BARUCH: Yes. I thought we were going to get into the war. I thought a war was coming long before it did . MR.

JEFFRIES: The law did t hat, didn’t it ? BARUCH: The government did that. GRAHAM: What did you mea n by the use of the word ‘we’? BARUGH: The government did that excuse me, but I meant we, the Congress. GRAHAM: You meant that the Congress pas sed a law covering that. BARUCH: Yes, sir. GRAHAM: Did you have anything to do with that ?"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"BARUCH: Not a thing. GRAHAM: Then I would not use the word ‘we’ if I were you.” Although Baruch played a crucial role in funding Wi lson’s campaign, in 1916, he had not ignored Wilson’s almost successful opponent, Charles Evans Hughes. Carter Field points out, in his biography of Baruch, “My personal view is that Baruch would have been tremendously important in the Hughes election, if Hughes had been elected in the close election of 19 16, both in the conduct of the war and in the making of the peace.” Field continu es, “Under this curious cloak of anonymity, Baruch exercised a very unusual type of political power in those early Wilson days. He was cultivated by most of the Wils on lights, who speedily found out that he could do more for them than they could do by directly appealing to Wilson. Naturally, there was no publicity for all this.” Field also says, “For one thing, Wilson not only lo ved Baruch, he ADMIRED him. Mrs. Wilson makes this specific state ment in her Memoirs.” Wilson’s relations with others were not always mark ed by such deep affection. David Lawrence, in his biography of Wil son, “The True Story of Woodrow Wilson”, notes that in June, 1907, former P resident Grover Cleveland, a trustee of Princeton, publicly denounced Wilson’s p lans to alter the character of the school, making a “bitter attack”. Cleveland had co me to live in Princeton after he left the White House, and was deeply attached to th e university. He died in the summer of 1908. That fall, when Wilson, as preside nt of the school, made his annual opening speech, he made no mention of Clevel and’s death, nor did he ever schedule a memorial exercise, as was the custom whe n a trustee passed away. The Baruch War Industries Board is particularly imp ortant to the present work, not only because of the dictatorial power exe rcised by Baruch during the war years, but because the WIB members have continued t o govern the United States. From WIB and the American Commission to Negotiate t he Peace came the Brookings Institution, which set national prioritie s for fifty years, NRA and the entire Roosevelt administration, and World War II. Working with Baruch at the WIB was his asst. chairman, Clarence Dillion of Dil lon, Read; Robert S."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Brookings, chmn.

Goethals was replaced by Gen. Pierce, who was then replaced by Gen. Hugh Johnson, who became Baruch’s righthand man for many years. Field tells us that “Gen. Hugh Johnson stayed on Baruch’s payroll for two months after he became head of NRA (during the New Deal.)” Field quotes Woodrow Wilson as hav ing Baruch at the WIB, “Let the manufacturer see the club behind your door.” B aruch told the Graham Committee, “We fixed prices with the aid of potenti al Federal compulsion.” Left out in the Baruch-Wilson mutual esteem society was William Jennings Bryan, longtime head of the Democratic Party. Brya n not only opposed our entry into World War I – he dared to criticise the family which had organized the war, the Rothschilds. Because he dared to mention the R othschilds, Bryan was promptly denounced as “anti-Semitic”. He responded , “Our opponents have sometimes tried to make it appear that we were atta cking a race when we denounced the financial policy of the Rothschilds. But we are nor we are as much opposed to the financial policy of J.P. Morgan as w e are to the financial policy of the Rothschilds.” Because of the secret planning needed to launch a m ajor war, control of the communications media was essential. Kent Cooper, p resident of the Associated Press, notes in Life, Nov. 13, 1944, “Freedom of In formation”, “Before and during the First World War, the great German news agency W olff was owned by the European banking house of Rothschild, which had its central headquarters in Berlin. A leading member of the firm was also kais er Wilhelm’s personal banker (Max Warburg). What actually happened in Imperial Germany was that the Kaiser used Wolff to bind and excite his people to such a degree that they were eager for World War I. Twenty years later under Hitler the p attern was repeated and enormously magnified by DNB, Wolff’s successors.”"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Cooper later noted in his autobiography, “Barriers Down”, “international bankers under the House of Rothschild acquired an i nterest in the three leading European agencies. (Havas, France; Reuters, Engla nd; Wolff, Germany).” On April 28, 1915, Baron Herbert de Reuter, Chief o f the Reuters Agency, shot himself. The cause was the crash of the Reute rs Bank, which had been organized by Baron Julius de Reuter, founder of Reu ter’s, to handle foreign remittances without their being subjected to any ac counting. He was succeeded by Sir Roderick Jones, who says in his autobiography, “Shortly after I succeeded Baron Herbert de Reuter in 1915, it so happened tha t I received an invitation from Mr. Alfred Rothschild, then head of the British Hou se of Rothschild, to lunch with him in historic New Court, in the City.” Jones pru dently refrains from telling us what was discussed at this meeting. Only one member of Congress voted against the U.S. declaration of war against Germany in World War I, Jeanette Rankin. S he was also the only member of Congress to vote against our entry into World Wa r II. Opponents of Wilson’s action were often beaten and imprisoned. Eugene De bs was sentenced to a long prison term. Congressman Charles Lindbergh ran for Governor of Minnesota on a platform opposing our participation in the war. Th e New York Times regularly ran scathing denunciations of his campaign. On June 9, 1918, it noted, “Rep. Clarence H. Miller denounced Lindbergh and the Non Partisan League as seditious. ‘According to Mr. Lindbergh the Liberty Loan is a i nstrument devised by the money sharks. It seems inexcusable that any person allowed to be at large in the United States could entertain or epxress such a vie w of this.’” Harrison Salisbury of the New York Times states, “I have searched out the records and they show that mobs trailed Charles K. Lindbergh Sr. during his 19 18 campaign for the Republican nomination for the Minnesota governorship. He was arrested on charges of conspiracy along with the Non Partisan Leaguers; a rally at Madison, Minn. was broken up with firehoses; he was hanged in effigy in Red Wing, dragged from the speaker’s platform, threatened with lynching, and h e escaped from town amid a volley of shots.”"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Salisbury neglects to mention that a squad of Feder al agents from the Bureau of Investigation, led by J. Edgar Hoover on his fir st important action, attacked Lindbergh and his family, dragged out all the copie s of Lindbergh’s Your Country at War, and burned them on the lawn; when young Ch arles rushed forward to stomp out the fire, Hoover knocked him down. In the summer of 1917, Woodrow Wilson named Col. Ho use to head the American War Mission to the Inter-Allied War Confer ence, the first such American mission to a European council. With House were his son-in-law, Gordon Auchincloss, and Paul Cravath, Kuhn Loeb’s lawyer. Auchincloss was director of Chase Natl. Bank, Solvay, So£ina, and Gross & Black well. Meanwhile, Walter Lippman and another group were bu sily working on the plans for the League of Nations. Lippmann had foun ded the American branch of the Fabian Society in 1905 as the Intercollegiate S ocialist Society, which later became the Students for a Democratic Society after a period when it was known as the League for Industrial Democracy; James T. Shot well and other internationalists worked with Lippmann on this organization. Although the war was going well for those who had p romoted it, hostilities were ended somewhat abruptly by the unforeseen inte rvention of an aide to the Czar of Russia, Maj. Gen. Count Cherep-Spiridovich, who says, “I had a long discussion with Gen. McDonough, Chief of the War In telligence Dept. in London; I submitted on Sept. 1, 1918 a report advising him peace with Bulgaria would provoke an uprising in Slavic Austria, panic in Ger many and surrender of her armies; my advice was accepted; two weeks later p eace was signed with Bulgaria, two weeks later Austria was out of the war, two wee ks later Germany surrendered.” L.L. Strauss of Kuhn, Loeb Co. states he was one of four American delegates who conferred with the Germans at Brussel s in March 1919 on the final armistice. On Nov. 11, 1918, the New York Times he adlined, “REDS GRIP ON GERMANY: Königsberg, Frankfurt-on-Main, Strassburg now controlled by Spartacist Soviets”. On Nov. 12, 1918, the New Yor k Times stated, “The revolution in Germany is today, to all intents and purposes, an accomplished fact.”"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"On the same day, the New York Times headlined, “Spl endor Reigns Again; Jewels Ablaze” – The occasion was a gala evening at the Me tropolitan Opera, with Caruso and Homer signing Samson and Delilah.

Lamont, as we ll as House, Wilson and Wilson’s Secretary of State, Robert Lansing, the Du lles’ uncle. Their genial host was Baron Edmond de Rothschild. Representing Franc e at the Peace Conference was Finance Minister Klotz, who, according to Nowel l-Baker, had for years been usefully employed by the Rothschilds to distribute bribes to the press. The Reparations Commission was established Jan. 25, 191 9, with Bernard Baruch from the U.S., Klotz from France, and Lord Cunliffe, Gov ernor of the Bank of England, representing England. Carter Field notes, “Nearly every afternoon Baruch had a pleasant session at the Crillon with three or four of his old cronies from the War Industries Board.” Wilson returned to the United States July 8, 1919, laden with one million dollars worth of jewelry, gifts from appreciative E uropeans as a reward for his promise to get the U.S. into the League of Nations. Not a single member of Congress had been with him at the Paris Peace Confe rence. His associates were the Fabians of America, Dr. James T. Shotwell, Euge ne Delano, and Jacob Schiff. Herbert Hoover immediately joined Col. House as the most vociferous advocate of our joining the League of Nations. Baruch later testified before the Graham Committee; “I was economic advisor with the peace commission. GRAHAM: Did yo u frequently advise the"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"President while there ?

BARUCH: And frequently those also.” The Reparations Commission ordered the Germans to i ssue four issues of bonds, all to be delivered to the Reparations Commi ssion as follows : 1. 20 billion gold marks, 5 billion paper marks by May 1, 1921 fo r the army of occupation. 2. War cost of Belgium – 4 billion gold marks due May 1, 1926. 3. 40 billion gold marks at 2½% interest from 1921-26, to be retired i n 1951. 4. a 30-year provisional fund of general reparations. (Treaty of Versailles, Financial Clauses 248-63). The bankers immediately began to treat these gigant ic sums as sources of capital, to be monetarised by loans and other negot iable instruments. Lloyd George told the N.Y. Journal American, June 24, 192 4; “The international bankers dictated the Dawes reparations settlement. The Pro tocol which was signed between the Allies and Associated Powers and German y is the triumph of the international financier. Agreement would never hav e been reached without the brusque and brutal intervention of the internationa l bankers.

In 1895, Cecil Rhodes, South African agent of the R othschilds, established a secret society whose avowed purposes was as follows : “In the end Great Britain is to establish a power so overwhelming that wars must cease and the Millennium be realized.” To achieve this goal, he left $150 mill ion to the Rhodes Trust. The Rothschild already had a group with similar aims, t he Round Table, set up by Lord Alfred Milner, into which J.P. Morgan had been recr uited in 1899. The Council on Foreign Relations Handbook of 1936 s tates, “On May 30, 1919, several leading members of the delegations to the Paris Peace Conference met at the Hotel Majestic in Paris to discuss setti ng up an international group which would advise their respective governments on international affairs. The U.S. was represented by Gen. Tasker H. Bliss (Chief of S taff, U.S. Army), Col. Edward M. House, Whitney H. Shepardson, Dr. James T. Shotw ell, and Prof. Archibald Coolidge. Great Britain was unofficially represent ed by Lord Robert Cecil, Lionel Curtis, Lord Eustace Percy, and Harold Temperley. It was decided at this meeting to call the proposed organization the Institute of International Affairs. At a meeting on June 5, 1919, the planners decided it wo uld be best to have separate organizations cooperating with each other. Consequ ently, they organized the Council on Foreign Relations, with headquarters in New York, and a sister organization, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, in London, also known as the Chatham House Study Group, to advise the Britis h Government. A subsidiary organization, the Institute of Pacific Relations, w as set up to deal exclusively with Far Eastern Affairs. Other organizations were set up in Paris and Hamburg, the Hamburg branch being called the Institut fur Auswar tige Politik, and the Paris branch being known as Centre d’Etudes de Politicque Etrangere, at 13 Rue de Four, Paris VI.” The Hamburg branch was establishe d, of course, because of the Warburg family bank there."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Having dominated the Paris Peace Conference, Baron Edmond de Rothschild saw the establishment of the World Order through these groups as the crowning achievement of his life. The “founders” o f the RIIA were, one and all, Rothschild men; honorary chairman of the GFR was E lihu Root, lawyer for Morgan and Kuhn, Loeb Co.; Alexander Hemphill, a M organ banker, and Otto Kahn of Kuhn, Loeb Co. The founders of the RIIA were Rothschild’s principa l South African agents; Sir Otto Beit, trustee of Rhodes Estate and directo r of British South Africa Co.; Percy Alport Molteno, son of the first Premier of C ape Colony; Sir Abe Bailey, owner of the Transvaal Mines, who worked closely wi th Sir Alfred Milner in starting the Boer War; John W.

During its early years, RIIA was principally funded by the Rothschilds through donations funnelled through Sir Abe Bailey and Sir Alfred Beit, with about 5100,000-year; since then, it has been funded with many millions of dollars by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation . In 1936 the RIIA $400,000 budget was also funded by the following corporate subscribers: N.M.

A number of popular books now in circulation claim that the Council on Foreign Relations is the secret government of the U nited States. Nothing could be more incorrect. The members of the Council on Fore ign Relations have never originated a single item of policy for the U.S. Gov ernment. They merely transmit orders to our government officials from the RIIA an d the House of Rothschild in London. It is true that the CFR comprises a ruling elite in the United States, but they are mere colonial governors absolutely respons ible to their overseers in the World Order.

Ford Foundation 1953-65, director of the R ockefeller Foundation, and personal lawyer to the Rockefeller family interests . His career is typical of a leading official of the World Order. While a student at Ha rvard, he became a protege of Felix Frankfurter. He joined the firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, lawyers for Kuhn, Loeb Co. where he remained from 1925-40. In 1940 Frankfurter recommended him to Henry Stimson as Asst. Sec. of W ar, where he remained from 1941-45. He wrote and issued the infamous War Dept, directive that military officers must disregard political views of servicem en “unless there is a specific finding that the individual involved has a loyalty to the Communist Party which overrides his loyalty to the U.S.” Senator McCarth y termed this directive “treasonable”. McCloy succeeded Eugene Meyer as president o£ the W orld Bank from 1947-49, was appointed High Commissioner of Germany where he served from 1949-52, was chmn. of the board Chase Natl.

He married Ellen Zinsser, who is not otherwise identified in McCloy’s 1947 Current Biogr aphy; in the 1961 issue, she is identified as the niece of Hans Zinsser, a bacterio logist. This is odd, because she is also the daughter of John Zinsser, partner of J.P. Morgan Co., and chmn. of the board of Sharp & Dohme chemicals. It is an interes ting footnote to history that the son-in-law of a J.P. Morgan partner should be a ppointed U.S. High Commissioner of a vanquished Germany. The New York Times noted on Aug. 6, 1965, “J.J. McC loy Proposes Foundation Pattern for European Giving”. He stated at Salzburg, “I wish that there could be erected in Europe a complex of found ations whose representatives could exchange thoughts with those of American foun dations and thus form a sort of informal approach to some of the great problems of the day.” “Informal” is the code word of the World Order. It means “issuing fr om world headquarters”. McCloy did not state the obvious, that five men con trol all of the major U.S. foundations, and that he wished they could have the same system in Europe. The RIIA has worked closely with the London School of Economics, which was set up as a training school for the World Order bureaucrats. The school was established in 1920 with financial aid from the Rot hschilds and Sir Julius Wernher. Sir Ernest Cassel later gave the school 472,000 pou nds. Prof. J.H. Morgan wrote in Quarterly Review, Jan. 1939, “When I once asked Lor d Haldane why he persuaded his friend Sir Ernest Cassel, grandfather of Lady M ountbatten, to settle by his will large sums on the London School of Economics, he re plied, our object is to make this institution a place to raise and train the bur eaucracy of the future Socialist State.” Sir William Beveridge, author of Great Bri tain’s ruinous Cradle to the Grave political program, was director of the London School of Economics from 1920-1937. The British Empire has prospered on piracy, slavery and the drug traffic. Drakes’ Pirates became the Merchants Adventurers Co . (Sebastian Cabot) which later became the Chartered Co. of East India.

This fortuitous arrangement encount ered resistance from some Chinese leaders, causing England to prosecute ten O pium Wars against China, from the Opium War of 1840-43 to the Manchurian Con quest of 1931. In 1715 the British East India Co. opened its first Far East office in Canton. Crown Policy deliberately fostered opium addiction among the natives to facilitate British political control. The British Empire was then threatened with bankruptcy if it lost the American colonies. In order to defe at the rebels, the profits of the opium trade with China were sent to the Elector of Hesse via Mayer Amschel Rothschild to hire 16,800 Hessian troops. Thus the drug traffic and the Rothschilds played a pivotal role in American histo ry, although it has been ignored or deleted from the history books. David Ricardo, father of the quantity theory of mon ey and the “rent”, or loot theory, was on the Court of Proprietors of the East India Co. He had John Stuart Mill appointed as Chief Examiner. The colon ial minister of England during the Opium Wars was Edward Bulwer Lytton, who wrote the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, bringing England E21 million in silver and co ntrol over the free port of Hong Kong. Britain then allied with the Hong Socie ty, the Triads and Assassins, to rule the Chinese to the present time. Bulwer Lytto n’s son was Viceroy of India during the 1880s at the height of the opium trade, and sponsored Rudyard Kipling’s writings about the British Raj in India. The profiteers from the drug trade included William, Earl of Shelburne, who orga nized Britain’s first Intelligence Service, whose agents were drawn from Britain’s lea ding families. Its chairman was George Baring, and it employed Adam Smith, Jeremy B entham, and Thomas Malthus.

The Belgian Relief Commission of 1916 became the Marshall Plan of 1948 . Once again, the loads of supplies were shipped into Europe, ostensibly for o ur Allies, but destined to maintain the Soviet bloc. Although Jacob Schiff’s personal agent, George Kenn an, had regularly toured Russia during the latter part of the ninetee nth century, bringing in money and arms for the Communist revolutionaries (his gra ndson said that Schiff had spent $20 million to bring about the Bolshevik Revo lution) more concerted aid was called for to support an entire regime. Kennan als o aided Schiff in financing the Japanese in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905; the Ja panese decorated Kennan with the Gold War Medal and the Order of the Sacred Trea sure. In 1915, the American International Corporation was formed in New York. Its principal goal was the coordination of aid, particularly financial assista nce, to the Bolsheviks which had previously been provided by Schiff and other banker s on an informal basis. The new firm was funded by J.P. Morgan, the Rockefeller s, and the National City Bank. Chairman of the Board was Frank Vanderlip, f ormer president of National City, and member of the Jekyll Island group which w rote the Federal Reserve Act in 1910; directors were Pierre DuPont, Otto Kahn o f Kuhn, Loeb Co., George Herbert Walker, grandfather of Vice President Georg e H.

No one would seriously believe that bankers of this magnitude would finance an “anti-capitalist” revolution for the Com munists, yet this is exactly what happened. These same men financed Woodrow Wilson’s political campaigns, and it was these same men to whom Wilson referred in hi s opening address to the Paris Peace Conference, when he said, “There is moreover a voice calling for these definitions of principles and purposes which is, it seems to me, more thrilling and more compelling than any of the moving voices with which the troubled air of the world is filled. It is the voice of the Russian pe ople. There are men in the United States of the finest temper who are in sympathy wit h Bolshevism because it appears to them to offer that regime of opportunity to the individual which they desire to bring about.” (The Great Conspiracy Against Russia , Seghers and Kahn.) The men of “the finest temper”, to whom Wilson referred , the Morgans and the Rockefellers, did not really desire opportunity for the individual; what they desired was the lifelong imposition of slavery under the Wo rld Order, and this is the goal which they continue to strive to achieve, on a worl d wide basis. These Americans “of the finest temper” chose Lenin to do their work because he had outlined the plan they wanted in “Th e Threatening Catastrophe” in September, 1917, “1. nationalisation of the banks. Ownership of capital which is manipulated by the banks is not lost or changed whe n the banks are nationalised and fused into one state bank, so that it is possib le to reach a stage where the state knows whither and how, from where and at what time millions and billions are flowing. Only control over bank operations providi ng they are merged into one state bank will allow, simultaneously with other me asures which can easily be put into effect the actual levying of income tax withou t concealment of property and income. The state for the first time would be in a position to survey all the monetary operations, then to control them, then to regulate economic life."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"FINALLY, to obtain millions and billions for large state operations, without paying the capitalist gentlemen skyhigh commissions for th eir services. It would facilitate the nationalisation of syndicates, abolition of com mercial secrets, the nationalisation of the insurance business, facilita te the control of and the compulsory organization of labor into unions, and t he regulation of consumption. The nationalisation of banks would make circulation of checks compulsory by law for all the rich, and introduce the confiscation of property for concealing incomes. The five points of the desired program then, are na tionalisation of the banks, nationalisation of the syndicates, the abolition of commercial secrets, and the compulsory organization of the population into cons umer associations.” It was the publication of this program which catapu lted Lenin into the leadership of Russia via the Bolshevik Revolution. In 1917, Frank Vanderlip publicly referred to Lenin as “the modern version o f George Washington.” The Lenin program is not only the program of Soviet Russia – it is the program of Roosevelt’s New Deal, Truman’s Socialism , the postwar Labor Government in England, and the guiding principle of subsequent American Administrations. The Labor Government of England p roved Lenin’s dictum that the ownership of capital is not affected by the nat ionalisation of the banks, when they nationalised the Bank of England. The Lenin p rogram is the entire program of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, “the actual l evying of income tax without concealment of property or income”, “the confiscati on of property for concealing incomes”. The Lenin program is the program of the big rich precisely because it abolishes private property, and puts it under the c ontrol of the state. The state is controlled by the big rich, the World Order. The definitive authority of the Lenin program captu red the attention of the financiers. Here was the opportunity to subdue and control all future competition with the power of a totalitarian state, to stifle f uture development, and to hold the entire population of the world in thrall to their g reed. This program took Lenin back to Moscow to seize the government by force and to rule by terrorism.

On April 13, Lenin embarked on the steamer sailing from Sassnitz to Sweden. So the trip through Germany took at least four days.” The Leninists quickly exhausted the funds advanced by the Germans when they reached Russia, and once again the Bolshevik b id for absolute power seemed in doubt. To whom should Lenin turn but his powerf ul friend in the White House ? Wilson promptly sent Elihu Root, Kuhn Loeb lawye r and former Secretary of State, to Russia with $20 million from his Special War Fund, to be given to the Bolsheviks. This was revealed in Congressional Hea rings on Russian Bonds, HJ 8714.U5, which shows the financial statement of Woo drow Wilson’s expenditure of the $100 million voted him by Congress as a Spec ial War Fund. The statement,"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"showing the expenditure of $20 million in Russia by Root’s Special War Mission to Russia, is also recorded in the Congressional Recor d, Sept. 2, 1919, as given by Wilson’s secretary, Joseph Tumulty. Not to be outdone in generosity, J.P. Morgan & Co. also rushed financial assistance to the beleaguered Lenin terrorists. Co l. Raymond Robins headed a Red Cross Mission to Russia. Henry P. Davison, J.P. Mo rgan’s righthand man (also a member of the Jekyll Island team which secretly wro te the Federal Reserve Act in 1910), had raised $370 million in cash for the Red Cross during World War I, of which several millions were brought to the Russians by Robins team. Aiding him in this charitable work were Frank Vanderlip, chair man of American International Corp., and William Boyce Thompson, another director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Major Harold H. Swift, head of t he meat packing family, accompanied Robins on this mission of mercy, or sho uld we say business ? Swift used the occasion to garner a $10 million meat orde r for his brother-in-law, Edward Morris, of Morris Co. On Jan. 22, 1920, the Soviets ordered another $50 million of meat from Morris Co. Wall Street lawyer Thomas D. Thacher was also a key man of the Robins mission of mercy. The involvement of the J.P. Morg an firm with the Bolshevik Revolution is revealed in Harold Nicholson’s biogra phy of Dwight Morrow (Morrow was the father-in-law of Charles Lindbergh Jr.) as follows, “His (Morrow’s) interest in Russia dated from March 1917 when Thomas D. Thacher, his law partner, had been a member of the American Red Cross Mission during the revolution. It was strengthened by his friendship with Alex Gumberg, who had come to New York as representative of the A ll-Russian Textile Syndicate. ‘I have felt,’ he wrote in May 1927, ‘that the time would come when something would have to be done for Russia.’ He was himself a ctive in furthering official relations between Soviet emissaries and the State D ept., and he provided M. Litvinov with a warm letter of recommendation to Si r Arthur Salter in Geneva."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Nor was this all. When in Paris he gave a dinner p arty at Foyot’s to which he invited M. Rakovsky and other Soviet representative s.” Morrow’s actions might be understandable in a profe ssor of economics at Polytechnic U., but they are incredible from a part ner of the world’s most prominent banking firm. Alex Gumberg was no mewlin g social worker but a hardcore propagandist, who returned to the U.S. in 1918 as Trotsky’s literary agent, and promptly placed two Trotsky manuscripts with pu blishers. Gumberg also became consultant to Chase National Bank, and Simps on Thacher and Bartlett. He had been business manager of the Soviet paper Novy Mir during the first months of revolution in Russia; when Raymond Robins’ Red Cro ss Mission arrived in Russia, Gumberg served as interpreter and advisor to the Mi ssion, working closely with Thacher. The present senior partner of Simpson Tha cher and Bartlett is Cyrus Vance, who served as Carter’s Secretary of State, a nd is now a director of the Rockefeller Foundation. The international financiers, advised by Gumberg, n ow launched a worldwide propaganda campaign to sell the Bolshevik s as idealists, selfless humanitarians, and the modern disciples of Christ, who wished only to spread brotherhood and universal love throughout the world . The tune rang strangely against the backdrop of the machine guns steadily c hattering in Russia as the “disciples of love” massacred millions of women and children, but none of their devout admirers in the United States heard this as a sour note. From the outset, the “humanitarians” showed an exce ssive concern for the material wealth which they had seized from its righ tful owners. The New York Times noted on Jan. 30, 1918, a despatch from Petrograd, “The people’s commissaries have decreed a State Mon opoly of gold. Churches, museums and other public institutions are required to place their gold articles at the disposal of the State. Gold articles belonging to private persons must be handed over to the State. Informants will receive one-thi rd of the value of the articles.”"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Lenin said, “The Soviet Union must carefully save i ts gold. When living with the wolves, howl like the wolves.” One of the first orders issued by the new regime wa s, “The banking business is declared a state monopoly.” Signed: Lenin, Kryl enko, Podvolsky, Gorbunov. Marx’s philosophy of history claims that the world operates solely through the economic organization of society, based on the production and exchange of goods. However, this is the world view of the para site, who is concerned only with obtaining his sustenance from the host. The materi alist reduction of life to the obtaining of food at someone else’s expense elimina tes first, man’s spiritual life, second, all ideas, because the materialist idea exp licitly excludes all other ideas, and third, the long term view, the concept of investing over a period of time for a return which will not be available for years or per haps never. The parasitic view is limited to the next meal, or to creating a situatio n in which he cannot be dislodged before obtaining his next meal. This Marxist short term view has become the standard doctrine in American graduate schools of b usiness, particularly Harvard, which was financed by George F. Baker and J.P. Morg an. The result is that American industry, limited by the short term view, has steadily declined for twenty- five years. The high interest rates imposed by the international bankers also force industry to concentrate on short term gains merely to pay interest on their loans. Marx said, “The first function of gold is to give t he commercial world a material by which to express value, that is, to exp ress the value of all other goods, as homynous variables, that are qualitatively ident ical and quantitatively comparable.” Karl Marx Soc. v.23, p.104. Marx’s economic views were entirely compatible with the views of the banking establishment in the City of London and par ticularly the House of Rothschild. It is no accident that Karl Marx is bu ried, not in Moscow, but in London, nor is it an accident that the triumph and bloodbath of the Bolsheviks in Russia gave the Rothschilds and their associates on e billion dollars in cash which the luckless Czar had deposited in their European a nd New York banks. Few people know that Marx had close relations with the British aristocracy, through his"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"marriage to jenny von Westphalen. She was related to the Scottish Dukes of Argyll, who had long been revolutionaries; and the Campbells, who set up the baptist splinter group, the Campbellites.

The present Earl of Balc arras is related to Viscount Cowdray, Weetman John Churchill Pearson, whose moth er was the daughter of Lord Spencer Churchill; his sister married the Duk e of Atholl, and he married the daughter of the Earl of Bradford. The Argyll-Balca rras family is represented by the Lindsay and Campbell families; the present Earl of Grawford, Robert A. Lindsay is the 29th Earl, and also the 12th Earl of Balcarras.

He was formerly private secretary to the Secretary of State, and later served as Minister of State for Defense and M inister of State for Foreign and Commercial Affairs. Despite a later reputation for “anti-Communism”, He rbert Hoover was not only the most tireless proponent of the League of N ations in partnership with Col. House; he also was the first American to step in w ith large scale assistance to prevent a massive uprising against the faltering Bo lshevik regime. Hoover saved the Bolsheviks by organizing a massive program to r ush food to the beleaguered Communists. On Nov. 28, 1917, his associate, Col. House had cabled Wilson a few days after the Bolsheviks seized power, urging the extreme importance of suppressing all American newspaper criticism of the Bolsheviks: “It is exceedingly important that such criticism be suppressed.” The telegram was placed in a confidential file, and only came to light six years later. In “The Unknown War with Russia”, Robert J. Maddox noted in 1977, “Wilson greeted the March Revolution in Russia as a major step toward achieving the kind of postwar world he envisioned. He made s ure the U.S. was the first to"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"recognize the Provisional Government.” Maddox poin ts out that Wilson insisted that No. 6 of his famous fourteen points at Versail les was that “Russia should continue under institutions of her own choosing”, t hus guaranteeing the future of the Bolshevik regime. His closest political aide, Col. House, sent his own secretary, Kenneth Durant, to Russia to become a secretary in the Soviet Bureau in 1920 ! William Laurence Sanders, chairman of Ingersoll Ran d, and deputy chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, wrote to W ilson, Oct. 17, 1918, “I am in sympathy with the Soviet form of government as t he best suited for the Russian people.” George Foster Peabody, also deputy chairm an of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York since 1914, and noted “philanthrop ist” who organized the General Education Board for the Rockefellers, state d that he supported the Bolshevik form of state monopoly. Thus we had thre e of the most prominent officials of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York o n record as supporting Bolshevism, Sanders, Peabody and William Boyce Thom pson. Thompson then announced he was giving one million dollars to prom ote Bolshevik propaganda in the United States ! Because the Federal Reserve Ba nk of New York was controlled by five New York banks who owned 53% of its stock, and because these five banks were directly controlled by N.M. Rothschild & Sons of London, we can only conclude that these three men were merely stating t he preferences of their employer. The National City Bank had already loane d Russia $50 million, and Guaranty Trust, whose directors were the leading fi nanciers in New York, now became the financial correspondent for Soviet inter ests in America. In January 1922, Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover introduc ed on behalf of Guaranty Trust a resolution permitting relations with “the n ew State Bank at Moscow”. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes strongly op posed this resolution, but Hoover succeeded in getting it approved. A German banker, Max May, now vice pres. of Guaranty Trust, became head of the foreign dept. of the Ruskombank in 1923, the first Soviet international bank.

In a typical move to disguise their operations, Ott o Kahn and several officials of Guaranty Trust then founded an “anti-C ommunist” group, United Americans, which circulated virulent anti-Communist and anti-Jewish propaganda. Like most such organizations, it was designed to di scredit and render impotent anyone opposed to Communism who became involved in its work. On Feb. 1, 1919, Edward L. Doheny, the oil tycoon, told C.W. Barron, founder of the Wall Street Journal , “Pres. Eliot of Harvard is teaching Bolshevism. Th e worst Bolsheviks in the U.S. are not only college professors, of whom President Wilson is one, but capitalists and the wives of capitalists. Frank G. Vanderlip i s a Bolshevik.

The Equitable Life Bldg. at 120 Brodway had been built by a corporation organized by Gen. T. Coleman DuPon t. During the early 1920s, 120 Broadway not only housed Equitable Life, but al so the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, whose directors were enthusiastically supporting the Bolsheviks; the American International Corporation, which had been organized to aid the Soviet Union; Weinberg and Posner, which received a $3 mi llion order for machinery from the Soviet Union in 1919, and whose vice presi dent was Ludwig Martens, first Soviet Ambassador to the U.S.; John McGregor Grant , whose operations were financed by Olaf Aschberg of Nya Banken, Stockholm, who had transmitted large sums furnished by the Warburgs for the Bolshevik Re volution; the London agent of Nya Banken was the British Bank of North Commerc e, whose chairman was Earl Grey, a close associate of Cecil Rhodes – Gran t had been blacklisted by the U.S. Government for his support of Germany during W orld War I; and on the top"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"floor of 120 Broadway was the exclusive Bankers Clu b. These were the organizers of the World Order. Their instrument of power was gold. The Great Soviet Encyclopedia noted, “Under socialist economic condi tions, gold is also a universal equivalent, used as a measure of value and a scale of prices. The gold content of the Soviet ruble was established at .0987412 grams as per Jan. 1, 1961. In the world socialist market gold is used as the universal mone y.” Many Americans are puzzled by the relentless devoti on of the Rockefeller Foundation to financing Communist organizations in many parts of the world. This dedication to Communism can be traced back to a crucial moment in the Bolsheviks’ march to power. In 1917, Mackenzie Kin g had established a lifelong relationship with John D. Rockefeller, Jr. whom he met in June, 1914. They had been born in the same year, 1874, and seemed to agr ee on everything. Soon, King was working closely with Frederick T. Gates and Ivy Lee to further the Rockefeller “philantropies”, which seemed to view Communism as the ideal vehicle to bring about world brotherhood. King wrote to this friend Violet Markham, “John D. Rockefeller Jr., the truest follower of Christ, has one purpose – to serve his fellow man.” King resolved that his one purpose was to se rve Rockefeller; he testified for him at the trial investigating the Colorado Iron an d Fuel Co. massacre before the Walsh Committee (the Rockefellers later tried to ha ve Walsh framed and expelled from the Senate, but failed due to the obstinancy o f Burton J. Wheeler; J.Edgar Hoover played a crucial role in setting up the fram e). The Rockefellers helped Mackenzie King obtain gover nment contracts for the Canadian Army during World War I, which set Kin g up for later blackmail (the “Panama” hold over the vassals). King sold hundred s of tons of rotten meat to be sent to the Canadian Army in Europe; boots of “lea ther”, which were mostly pasteboard and which disintegrated immediately in t he watersoaked trenches; rifles that jammed when they were fired; and collar type life preservers (previously condemned) which broke the soldiers’ necks when the y jumped into the water. While Leon Trotsky was in New York in 1917, he rece ived word to return to Russia at once to help bring off the Bolshevik seiz ure of power. The Rockefellers"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"gave him $10,000 in cash for his journey, procured a special passport for him from President Woodrow Wilson, and sent Lincoln Steffens to safeguard him on the journey. When Trotsky’s ship stopped in Halifax, t he Canadian Secret Service, warned that he was on board, arrested him on April 3, 1917 and interned him in Nova Scotia. The patriotic agents knew that Trotsk y was on his way to Russia to take Russia out of the war against Germany, which w ould free many German divisions to attack the Canadian troops on the West ern Front. Prime Minister Lloyd George indignantly cabled demands from London that Trotsky be released, but the secret service ignored him. By means never explained, Mackenzie King then stepped into the breach and obtained Trotsky’s freedom. Trotsky continued on his way to Russia, and became Lenin’s chief depu ty in the extermination of Russian citizens; he also organized the Red Army w ith the able help of Wall Street lawyer Thomas D. Thacher. The agents who had arres ted Trotsky were dismissed from the service; their careers were ended. As a reward for his intervention, the Rockefellers appointed Mackenzie King head of the R ockefeller Foundation dept. of Industrial Research at a salary of $30,000 a yea r (the average wage in the U.S. at that time was $500 year). Frank P. Walsh testified before a U.S. Commission that the Rockefeller Foundation was a cloak for the Rock efeller plan to lead organized labor into slavery. King also became a director of the Carnegie Corpora tion. A Lady Laurier left him a large mansion in Ottawa, and in 1921 a g roup of wellwishers, led by Peter Larkin, refurbished and staffed it for him at a cost of $255,000. King then appointed Larkin High Commissioner of Canada in Lon don. In 1940, the Canadian Parliament voted King, then Prime Minister of Canada “absolute and dictatorial powers for the duration”. On King’s 74 th birthday in 1948, John D. Rockefeller Jr. gave him $100,000. The Rockefeller Foundation then put up $300,000 to pay for the writing of King’s Memoirs. In his final years, King, still on the take, was exposed as a principal in the $30 mil lion Beauharnais Power Co. swindle during the building of the St. Lawrence Sea way. King had accepted"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"$700,000 from Beauharnais for the Liberal Party, an d among other enticements had received a trip to Bermuda. The Rockefellers figured in many pro-Soviet deals d uring the 1920s. Because of the struggle for power which developed b etween Stalin and Trotsky, the Rockefellers intervened in October, 1926, and backe d Stalin, ousting Trotsky. Years later, they would again intervene when the Kr emlin was racked by disagreements; David Rockefeller summarily fired K ruschev. John D. Rockefeller instructed his press agent, Ivy Lee in 1925 to prom ote Communism in the U.S. and to sparkplug a public relations drive which culmina ted in 1933 with the U.S. government recognition of Soviet Russia. In 1927 S tandard Oil of New Jersey built a refinery in Russia, after having been promised 50 % of the Caucasus oil production. The Rockefeller firm, Vacuum Oil, sign ed an agreement with the Soviet Naptha Syndicate to sell Russian oil in Euro pe, and made a $75 million loan to Russia. John Moody had stated in 1911, “the Sta ndard Oil Co. was really a bank of the most gigantic character – a bank within an i ndustry ... lending vast sums of money to needy borrowers just as other great banks were doing ... the company was known as the Standard Oil Bank. As Rockefeller was no banker, this meant that the Standard Oil was being directed by profess ional bankers.” The Standard Oil operation has always been directed by the most professional bankers in the world, the Rothschilds; consequently, the Rothschi lds through their agents, Kuhn Loeb Co. have maintained close supervision of the “ Rockefeller” fortune. In 1935, Stalin expropriated many foreign investmen ts in Russia, but the Standard Oil properties were not touched. The Five Year Plans (1928-32, 1933-37, and 1938-42) were all financed by the international banking houses. During the 1920s, the principal firms doing business with Russ ia were Vacuum Oil, International Harvester, Guaranty Trust and New Yor k Life, all firms controlled by the Morgan-Rockefeller interests.

This insured that Czarist gold sent to Eng land would not be seized by his cousins, the British Royal Family. On July 7, 1922 , Litvinov revealed that the Russian delegation at the Hague Conference was nego tiating with an important group of financiers which included Otto H. Kahn of Kuhn Loeb Co. A week later, Kahn arrived at The Hague. He stated, “The confere nce with the Russians will bring useful results and will lead to a closer appr oach to unity of views and policies on the part of England, France and the U.S. in resp ect to the Russian situation.” When Otto Kahn’s wife visited Russia in 1936, she w as treated like visiting royalty. In 1922, the Chase National Bank had established th e American-Russian Chamber of Commerce to promote trade with and gover nment recognition of Russia. Its chairman was Reeve Schley, a vice pres ident of Chase; he was a director of many corporations including Howe Sound, Electric Boat, the Yale Corp., chairman of Sundstrand and Underwnod; he had serve d as director of the U.S. Fuel Administration from 1917-1919. His son, Reeve Schley Jr. was a Captain in the O.S.S. under Gen. Donovan in World War II. Bot h Chase and Equitable Trust led in granting credits to the Soviet Union during the 1920s. In 1934, Roosevelt established the Export Import Bank to finance incre ased trade with the Soviet Union. During World War II, Chase was AMTORG’S pri ncipal bank in handling the many billions of dollars of Lend Lease transact ions for Russia. Roosevelt went all out in supporting the Soviets, perhaps because all three of his personal assistants, Alger Hiss, Lauchlin Currie and Harry D exter White, were identified as Soviet agents. Hiss’ mentor was Dean Acheson, form erly of J.P. Morgan Co. Asst Secretary of State A.A. Berle Jr. testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee Aug. 30, 1948 that “Acheson was the head of the pro-Russian group in the State Department.” Acheson later became senior partner of Covington and Burling, obtaining the position for the firm as Was hington legal representative for nine Communist governments.

The State Dept. delayed action on this req uest for several weeks. On March 22, Harry Dexter White met with Gromyko at th e Soviet Embassy and assured him the plates would be delivered. Both Ha rriman and White made daily demands until the plates were turned over to the So viet Union April 14, 1944. The Soviet Union then printed $300 million in currency which was redeemed by the American taxpayers. After the “Cold War” began, the financiers continue d their efforts to aid the Soviets. In 1967, the New York Times announced that a new consortium had been formed to promote trade with Russia, composed of Cy rus Eaton’s Tower Corp., Rockefeller’s International Basic Economy Corp., an d N.M. Rothschild & Sons of London. Eaton had begun his career as a $2 a day f actotum for John D. Rockefeller, who later financed his purchase of Can adian Gas & Electric Corp. Eaton stated that Rockefeller soon interested him i n Russian affairs. In an interview with Mike Wallace, Eaton claimed that und er Communism, the people of the Soviet Union were entirely contented. “They we re happy. I was amazed at their happiness and dedication to the system.” Eat on was one of the first defenders of the Stalin-Hitler Pact in 1939. The Rothschilds have rarely been identified with Co mmunist causes, preferring to remain in the background. Only one m ember, N.M. Victor Rothschild, who served an apprenticeship with J.P. Morgan Co., had become involved with the Apostles Club at Cambridge, descr ibed by Michael Straight as composed mostly of Communists who were also homosex ual. Its well known members were Guy Burgess and Donald MacLean, Anthon y Blunt, Keeper of the Queen’s Pictures, and the double, or triple agent K im Philby. During World War II. Victor Rothschild, who was with MI5, lent his L ondon flat at No. 5 Bentinck St."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"to Burgess, while his mother, Mrs. Charles Rothschi ld, hired Burgess as her investment counselor. Blunt left the staff of the Warburg Institute to work with MI5; he introduced Victor Rothschild to his aunt, Teresa Mayor, who later became Lady Rothschild. Blunt has been recently described as having had an “affectionate” relationship with the Queen. The Rockefeller family is sometimes called the firs t family of the Soviet Union. When Nelson Rockefeller was nominated for v ice president in 1967, Pravda indignantly denounced his critics, saying th at charges against Rockefeller were designed only to discredit him, and that the a ccusations came from ultra right wing organizations. Senator Frank Church, attendin g the 1971 Dartmouth Conference at Kiev, was amazed to find that “David Rockefeller was treated like we would treat royalty in this country. The Russia n people appear to evince an adoration of Rockefeller that is puzzling.” When D avid Rockefeller’s plane lands in Russia, crowds line up to greet him at the airpo rt, and line the streets of Moscow as his limousine passes, hailing him with cries of RAHK FAWLER. George Gilder remarked that no one knows how to revere, blandish and exalt a Rockefeller half as well as the Marxists. After World War II, Dean Acheson frantically lobbie d for an additional $300 million loan to the Soviet Union. Ed Burling, who was Frederic A. Delano’s brother-in-law, had founded the firm of Covington a nd Burling of which Acheson was partner, with Donald Hiss, brother of Alger. W hen Acheson’s lobbying failed to develop the Russian aid, the Council on Foreign Relations drafted the Marshall Plan as an alternative measure. Their publication, “Foreign Affairs”, then published the “containment plan” as written by “X” (George Kennan). The policy of containment, which has been the official foreign policy of the U.S. toward the Soviet Union since 1947, guarantees not only Soviet Russia’s borders, but her continued enslavement of the “Captive nations” whic h she holds by military force. Henry Luce, who always provided a forum for the int ernational propagandists, reprinted the entire text of the July, 1947 Foreign Affairs article in Life magazine, July 28, 1947. Its key sentence was “The main elem ent of any U.S. policy towards"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"the Soviet Union must be the long-term, patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian expansive tendencies”. Luce’s Time maga zine dubbed Kennan “America’s senior policy-maker”. He later became a fellow of the Institute of Advanced Study of Princeton. Kennan was the nephew and namesake of the George Kennan who operated as a Marxist agent for J acob Schiff in Russia for many years before the Bolshevik Revolution, and was finally expelled by the Czarist Government. Kennan’s pen-name “X” was a favorite i dentification of Socialist operatives. In 1902, the Socialist “X” Club had be en founded in New York by John Dewey, whose Socialist program has dominated A merican education during the twentieth century. The other founders of the “ X” Club were James T. Shotwell, founder of the League of Nations, United Nations etc.; Morris Hillquit, Communist candidate for Mayor of New York, Charles Edward Russell, and Rufus Weeks, vice president and managing director of New York Life, which was controlled by J.P. Morgan. When Nikolai Kruschev, dictator of the Soviet Union , came to New York Sept. 17, 1959, he was invited to dinner at W. Aver ill Harriman’s Home.

Gosbank employs 5000 economists, and is known as a “passive”, rather than an “active ” bank of issue, meaning that it follows orders from other sources, as does the Fede ral Reserve Board of Governors. The Gosbank-Federal Reserve System “coo peration” in Soviet financial letters is handled through the Bank for I nternational Settlements in Switzerland. In 1949, the present flood of “Eurodollars” origina ted as European deposits of Communist dollar hoards in the Soviet Eurobank o f Paris, Banque Commerciale pour Europe du Nord. The financiers then realized they created a new and even more untraceable source of paper money which had no backing. Anthony Sampson writes that “The more cosmopolitan banks wi th foreign experts and directors, such as Warburgs, Montagus, Rothschilds and Kleinworts, had also discovered a huge new source of profits in the mark et for Eurodollars.” These profits now amount to some two trillion dollars, al l of which are obligations of the American taxpayer. This Ponzi operation was made p ossible by the exclusive “Central Bankers Club”, the Bank for International Settlements, which had been established by Hjalmar Schacht, financier of the Na zi movement, Emile Francqui, guiding genius of Hoover’s Belgian Relief Commissio n, and John Foster Dulles, heir to the title “most dangerous man in America”. It was set up in May 1930 by the Hague Treaty to handle German reparations payme nts, which, of course, were never paid. BIS now controls one tenth of the worl d’s gold, which it rents out at a profit. Its assets have increased by an astronomic al 1200% in the past twenty years. U.S. shares of BIS are held by Citibank."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"American International Corporation continued to exe rcise a behind the scenes role in U.S. Soviet dealings until World War II, when W.A. Harriman’s presence in Moscow to direct Stalin’s handling of t he war usurped its duties. Standard and Poors shows in 1982 an American Intern ational Group, an insurance holding company with $3.4 billion in assets, whose attorneys are Sullivan & Cromwell. It was formed from the Cornelius V. Star r insurance network which was part of the CIA’s Asiatic operations. Its dire ctors include Harry Kearns, chmn Eishenower-Nixon presidential campaign, now chmn Am erican Asian Bank, served as president Export Import Bank 1969-73; William L. Hemphill, pres.

Granville Mentin of England, who was chairman of American Internatio nal from 1946-1979, now director of the Starr Foundation; and J. Milburn S mith, director of Lloyd’s of London. Prominent American businessmen and political leader s such as W. Averill Harriman do not bother to conceal their pro-Soviet activities. Russian Ambassador Dobrynin casually referred to Henry Kissinger’s dou ble role, saying, “I am the laughing third man, sitting still. Kissinger is ne gotiating for us too.” Brezhnev, dictator of Russia, was asked why the Soviet Union did not take a role in Middle East negotiations. He replied, “We don’t need repr esentation. Kissinger is our man in the Middle East.” With this kind of influence, it seems odd that the Communists do not precipitate a coup, and seize absolute power in the U.S., as they did in Russia in 1917. There are 200,000,000 answers to this questi on, not 200,000,000 Americans, but 200,000,000 guns held privately by American cit izens. A confidential Ford Foundation study showed that only 5 to 10% of Ameri cans would actively resist a Communist seizure of power. This was the good news . The bad news was that only 1 % of our citizens, armed and opposing the ta keover, would defeat it. Since 1948, Americans have asked this writer when the Com munists will seize power in"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"the U.S. The answer is that they will seize power after they have confiscated the 200,000,000 guns. Guns are forbidden in the Soviet Union. Only the highest officials are allowed to possess them. Criminals u nderstand only one law – the law of force. The criminal syndicalists who seek to en slave the entire world cannot be defeated by humility or compassion, but only by the most determined and the harshest measures. To examine the American situati on in perspective, there are only five hundred men, primarily in the major found ations, who are actively engaged in transmitting international banker-Social ist orders to our government. Beneath them are ten thousand politicians, business men, media personalities, and academicians who, with the aid of religious operati ves, implement the orders from London. This is a much smaller number than the mem bers of the Communist Party of the USSR which rules the Soviet Union. To protect these traitors, the U.S. government has imported 25 million aliens into the United States, which includes 5000 intensi vely trained terrorists, and 100,000 hardened criminals. This force is intended to neutralize the opposition of the American people to Communism. The government e ncourages crime, because it is the nationwide criminal force, not the police force, which keeps the population subdued. Americans must devote all their energies to defending themselves against the professional criminals, protecting their homes and families, leaving them no opportunity to organize against the criminal syndic alists of the World Order. This clever plan of subsidizing the criminal element was the sole achievement of the Law Enforcement Administration, a foundation-organi zed plan which originated at the University of Chicago. The federal government uses its armed police, the I RS, the FBI, the BATF and the CIA solely to terrorize its American subjec ts into compliance with the program of the World Order. Most American citizens have had to come to the painful realization that the FBI is not concerned w ith fighting Communism, but only with battling American anti-Communists. They now realize that the IRS functions as an armed group of terrorists, not to c ollect funds, of which the government has no need, but solely to extort money by force from American"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"citizens, as part of the program of the World Order . The intent is to render them impoverished and terrorized, so that they will be r endered impotent and unable to organize to resist the World Order. It is the prog ram of 1984. Even if they planned otherwise, the five masters of the World Order have now created a situation which must lead to world wa r, world economic collapse, or both. The thirty-year buildup o[ the Soviet Union as the next opponent in an ongoing world conflict was noted by Srully Blotnick in Forbes magazine, Nov. 7, 1983: “A wealthy New York lawyer whose portfolio containe d substantial holdings of McDonnell Douglas, Raytheon and General Dynamics, c ommented, ‘It bothers me even to think what would happen if the Russians dec ided to take us up on our 5% a year solution to the arms race. Once we started dismantling our stategic weapons, the defense stocks will make the hi tech g roup look stable by comparison. The 60% loss I took on my Fortune comp uter system could be a hint of things to come’.” The World Order has no religious, political or econ omic program except World Slavery. Only by subduing all potential oppo sition can the parasite guarantee his position of lodging on the host. The World Order sets up countless groups to promote any type of idea, and then sets u p other groups to fanatically oppose them, but the masters have no dedication to anything except slavery. As R.E. McMaster wrote in The Reaper , “The goal of international communism is not to destroy Western international debt capitalism. The goal of international communism is to enslave mankind at the behest of We stern international debt capitalism.” This is all you can ever know about t he present world situation, and it is all you need to know. In law and finance, it is prudent to make up a “wor st case” theory. What is the worst case theory we could apply to the U.S. ec onomy today ? It is not more inflation, higher debt and interest rates, or highe r taxes. These are already inevitable. The worst case is a revolution in Russ ia. Let us suppose a truly"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"terrifying scenario, that the inmates of the Soviet concentration camps have been surreptitiously armed. They rise up and seize powe r in a coup which would be as impossible to stop as the Bolshevik coup of 1917. Americans would applaud if a patriotic Christian government which, like the Czar ’s government, desired only peace with the U.S., suddenly seized power in Russi a. Or would we ? We could hardly applaud, because we would be too busy dodgin g the bodies falling from windows on Wall Street. Within hours, our defense- oriented stocks would collapse, dragging down the entire market with them . As Blotnick barely hints, there would be a complete economic collapse in the United States. The fact is that the World Order has made the economy of the U.S. en tirely dependent on a “threat” from Russia; it could not survive a “frie ndly” regime. That is why the CIA (also known as the Central Investment Agency) c o-operates with the KGB to create and destroy anti-Communist groups around the world. The CIA has never engaged in sabotage in the Soviet Union; the KGB h as never engaged in sabotage in the U.S. By betraying the anti-Communist fighte rs at the Bay of Pigs, the CIA bolstered Castro’s shaky regime and destroyed his o pposition. He has never again faced any challenge. Former CIA official David Att lee Phillips says (p. 107 “THE NIGHT WATCH” that Dean Rusk (Rockefeller Foundation ) ordered the cancellation of the air strike, which doomed the an ti-Communist forces at the Bay of Pigs to annihilation. Powers, in his biography of Richard Helms, also identifies Rusk as the man who cancelled the air support of th e anti-Communists. CHAPTER THREE Franklin D. Roosevelt The Crash of 1929 and the resulting depression have been exhaustively covered in a previous work ( Secrets of the Federal Reserve , 1983). Roosevelt was elected president in 1932 in a campaign which ignor ed Hoover’s Rothschild connections and his World War I record. Instead, R oosevelt blamed Hoover for a"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"depression which had been set up by the Bank of Eng land. Hoover states in his Memoirs. “In replying to Roosevelt’s statement that I was re sponsible for the orgy of speculation, I considered for some time whether I s hould expose the responsibility of the Federal Reserve Board by its deliberate infl ation policies from 1925-28 under European influence, and my opposition to these poli cies.” Hoover remained silent, and was ushered out of offi ce. He later termed Gerard Swope’s “economic planning” for the New Deal as “the precise pattern of Fascism”. “The New Dealers”, by an Unofficial Obse rver, Literary Guild 1934, noted that the New Deal included W.A. Harriman, adm inistrator in charge of heavy industry, and his sister, Mary Rumsey, who backed N ewsweek with Vincent Astor, and the New Deal weekly, Today . “Observer” also noted that Col. House was the elder statesman behind the New Deal, and that House had only backed two Presidential candidates, Wilson and FDR. Roosevelt continued the Wilson policies (actually the House policies outlined in “Philip Dr u, Administrator”), with the same personnel, and ended as Wilson did, by involving Am erica in another World War. Observer states that Col. House’s New York apartmen t was only two blocks from the Roosevelt home on E. 65th St. in New York, and that House was seen there almost every day in 1932. He also visited Roosevel t in New England and on the Roosevelt yacht. To consolidate Roosevelt’s power, his backers used the typical World Order scheme – they set up his “opposition”. In August, 1934, the principal architects and financiers of his New Deal formed the Liberty L eague, immediately characterized as an “extreme rightwing” organizatio n. Pierre and Irenee DuPont put up $325,000 for it. The League was also financ ed by J.P. Morgan, the Rockefellers, J. Howard Pew, and William J. Knudsen (who was later appointed by FDR to an important position!). The backers of Lib erty League, who were busily denouncing Roosevelt & his staff as “Communist”, wh ich many of them were, were also the organizers of American International Corporation, which had been"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"formed to prevent the economy of the Soviet Union f rom collapsing. Liberty League successfully corralled the opponents of FDR and branded them as “rightwing nuts”. Roosevelt was given the opportun ity to rant against his opposition as “economic royalists”, “the Old Guard” , and “princes of privilege”. Gerald L.K. Smith was then brought into the picture , in order to smear Roosevelt's opposition as “anti-Semitic”. The ploy operated fr om 1934 to the 1936 elections, when it effectively destroyed London's campaign. N o effective political opposition was organized against Roosevelt for the rest of his lifetime in office. It was one of the most successful political hoaxes in American hi story. Roosevelt then married his son to an heiress of the DuPont dynasty. At th e very time that Eugene DuPont, cousin of Pierre, was one of the most activ e members of the Liberty League, F.D. Roosevelt Jr. was courting his daughte r, Ethell ! They were married June 28, 1937, in what Time Magazine called the “Wedding of the Year”, presided over by Dr. Endicott Peabody. The couple made the cover of Time magazine, the only newlyweds ever to do so. These measures were necessary because FDR's backers were planning to involve the U.S. in the Second World War. Any popu lar political opposition to Roosevelt might have swept him out of office in 194 0, just when he was needed to bring off the Pearl Harbor attack. On the morning of Pearl Harbor, Gen. Marshall, his Chief of Staff, met secretly with Maxim Litvino v (married to Ivy Low of England), to assure the Russians that everything wa s going according to plan. Marshall later testified before Congress that he “c ouldn't remember” where he was on Pearl Harbor Day. The “managed conflict” was well on its way. Jacque s Rueff points out that Schacht did not invent Hitler's monetary policy; it was imposed on Germany “by American and British creditors to finance war prepa rations and finally unleash war itself” ( The Monetary Sins of the West ). Rueff also points out that the Standstill Agreement of 1931 allowing Germany a moratorium on war debts through the 1930s was a amicable pact between the London, New Y ork and German branches of the Warburg and Schroder houses. Max Warburg re mained Schacht's deputy at"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"the Reichsbank until 1938; Kurt von Schroder then b ecame his deputy. (Schacht's father had been Berlin agent for the Equitable Life Insurance Co. of New York.) The industrialist levies for Hitler (the Circle of Friends) were paid into the Schroder Bank. Throughout the 1930s, Hitler was duped into perseve ring in his desire for friendship with England, an alliance originally pro posed jointly by Theodore Roosevelt and the Kaiser in 1898 between the three Nordic powers, England, Germany and the United States. The Schröders assur ed Hitler that their Anglo- German Fellowship in England was a hundred times mo re influential than it actually was. With such figures as the Astors and the Chamberlains supporting rapport with Germany, Hitler was persuaded that war with England was impossible. In 1933 he had announced his discovery that Marx, Lenin and Stalin had all said that before international Communism co uld triumph, England and her Empire must be destroyed. “I am willing to help de fend the British Empire by force if called upon,” he declared. In 1936, Hitle r arranged for meetings to take place between English and German diplomats, but the desired result was never attained, as the British had only one goal to lull Hitler into a sense of false security until they could declare war against him. To lure Hitler into World War II, it was necessary to guarantee him adequate supplies of such necessities as ball bearings and o il. Jacob Wallenberg of the Swedish Enskilda Bank, which controlled the giant S KF ball bearing plant, furnished ball bearings to the Nazis throughout the war. The anti aircraft guns sending flak against American air crews turned on S KF ball bearings. Its American plant, SKF of Philadelphia, was repeatedly put on t he Proclaimed List, and each time, Dean Acheson removed it. President William S. Farish of Standard Oil refuele d Nazi ships and submarines through stations in Spain and Latin Amer ica. When Queen Elizabeth recently came to the U.S., the only family she visi ted was the Farishes. Throughout the war, the British paid royalty to Ethyl-Standard Corp. on the gasoline used by German bombers who were destroying London. The mon ey was placed in Farben"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"bank accounts until after the war. I.G. Farben was organized by the Warburgs in 1925 as a merger between six giant German chemical companies, Badische Anilin, Bayer, Agfa, Hoechst, Welierter-Meer, and Griesheim -Elektron. Max Warburg was director of I.G. Farben, Germany, and I.G. Chemie, Switzerland. American I.G. Farben was controlled by his brother, Paul, archite ct of the Federal Reserve System, Walter Teagle of Standard Oil, and Charles Mitchell of National City Bank. Just before World War II broke out, Ethyl-St andard shipped 500 tons of ethyl lead to the Reich Air Ministry through I.G. F arben, with payment secured by letter of Brown Bros. Harriman dated Sept. 21, 1938 . Throughout World War II, the Paris branches of J.P. Morgan and chase National Bank continued to do business as usual. A t the end of the war, occupation authorities repeatedly issued orders to dismantle I.G. Farben plants, but were countermanded by Gen. William Draper of Dillon Read, which had financed German rearmament in the 1920s. Winston Churchill remarked of this “managed conflic t” in 1945, just before it ended, “There never was a war more easy to stop. ” (quoted in Washington Post June 11, 1984). The only real difficulty had been encountered in getting it started. Churchill succeeded in prolonging the war for at le ast a year by defeating Gen. Wedemeyer's plan for a Channel crossing in 1943, an d by embarking on his ruinous North African-Sicilian swing, a replay of his disas trous Gallipoli campaign of the First World War. Life revealed April 9, 1951 that Eisenhower had radioed Stalin through the U.S. Military Mission in Moscow of his plan to stop at the Elbe and allow the Russians to take Berlin. The message had been written by Ike's political advisor, John Wheeler-Bennett of RIIA, received by W. Averill Harriman, and delivered to Stalin. In Washington, Gen. Marshall assured President Truman that we were “obligated” to allow the Russians to take B erlin. Senator Joseph McCarthy later called Marshall “a living lie”. The conquered German people were now systematically looted and ruthlessly governed by the occupying powers. Henry Kissinger, John J. McCloy (son-in-law of a J.P.

Aid to Soviet Russia continued under the guise of the Mars hall Plan, a rerun of Hoover's Belgian Relief Commission in World War I. The Mars hall Plan originated as a special study by David Rockefeller for the Council on Foreign Relations, “Reconstruction of Western Europe” completed in 194 7. It was retitled the “Marshall Plan” and advertised as a great contribut ion to “democracy in Europe”. (Imperial Brain Trust-Shoup). W. Averell Harriman was installed in the Rothschild's Paris mansion, Hotel Talleyrand, as he ad of the Marshall Plan. The victorious Rothschilds consolidated their contr ol of world monetary systems by the Bretton Woods pact, a replica of the charter of the Bank of England. It provided immunity from the judicial pr ocess, its archives were inviolable and not subject to court or Congressiona l inspection; no taxation could be levied on any security dividend or interest of t he Fund; all officers and personnel were immune from legal processes. The pa ct systematically looted Western Europe and the United States. On April 3, 1984, AP reported that “British” investments in the U.S. were now $115 bil lion, and the British held $28 billion in U.S. bank assets. At least one U.S. Sen ator is a member of the British aristocracy, Malcolm Wallop, (R. Wyo.) son of Hon. Oliver Wallop, whose brother is Earl of Portsmouth (created 1743). Sen. Wallop' s sister, Lady Porchester, married Lord Porchester, son of the Earl of Carnarv on. Lord Porchester is the Queen's Master of Horse, and her Racing Manager. Lord Carrington, for many years British Foreign Min ister, is now Henry Kissinger's partner in Kissinger Associates, and wa s recently appointed head of NATO. He is chum of GE chum Australian New Zealand Bank, director of Rio Tinto, Barclay's Bank, Cadbury Schweppes, Amalgamat ed Metal, British Metal, and Hambros Bank. His mother was the daughter of Visco unt Colville, who was financial secretary of the treasury 1936-38. Richa rd Davis notes in “The English Rothschilds” that Lionel Rothschild was a frequent visitor at Lord Carrington's house in Whitehall.

World War II delivered the peoples of the world int o the hands of the World Order, with the predictable result that they have b een systematically despoiled, terrorized, oppressed and massacred in further “man aged conflicts”, not the least of which was the Vietnam War, in which American boy s with little or no combat training were sent into battle against the highly t rained guerilla troops of Ho Chi Minh and General Giap, communist troops whose leade rs had been intensively trained by the special OSS Deer team. The Rothschilds rule the U.S. through their foundat ions, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Federal Reserve System, with no serious challenges to their power. Expensive “political campaigns” are r outinely conducted, with carefully screened candidates who are pledged to th e program of the World Order. Should they deviate from the program, they would ha ve an “accident”, be framed on a sex charge, or indicted on some financial irre gularity. Senator Moynihan stated in his book, “Loyalties”, “A British friend, wise in the ways of the world, put it thus: They are now on page 16 of the Plan.” Moy nihan prudently did not ask what page 17 would bring. The American citizen works hard and pays taxes, bli ssfully unaware that at any moment the secret rulers, operating through the Federal Reserve Board, can make a monetary ruling which will place him in oner ous debt or bankrupt him. Gary Allen writes in American Opinion , Oct. 7, 1979, “Whatever the future holds, you can bet it will be unstable with wide swings in the value of the dollar and precious metals. As long as Volcker's sponsors kno w in advance what his policies will be, they will make big money.” This accurate prediction was followed by 20% interest and 25% inflation. Businessweek , Feb. 20, 1984, stated, “The worst market for trad ers is a stable one.... Investment banks now have a greater than ev er vested interest in market instability. They can rack up enormous profits by guessing right about rapid, wide"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"swings in profits, prices and interest rates.” It is obvious that they can rack up “enormous profits” if they know in advance what the monetary decisions will he. Anyone who seriously believes that no one knows in advance what Federal Reserve decisions will be is too naive to be allowed out on their own; anybody who believes that there is no one who can tell the Fede ral Reserve Board what its policies are to be is even more out of touch with r eality. Many people believed that Lord Montagu Norman ran the Bank of England as a on e-man show for thirty years, showing that some people will believe anythi ng. A. Craig Copetas writes in Harper's , Jan. 1984, “How the Barbarians Do Business” about the 2,000 dealers of the London Metal Exchange, that viewing these peopl e objectively, “you are left with a simple scrap merchant – a rag and bone man, as the British call their junk dealers.” It is the rag and bone men who are runni ng the economies of the world up and down like a window shade, and profiting hand somely on every move of the markets. Carter Field notes in his biography of Baruch, “Bar uch got out of the market just before the Crash. But what made Baruch sell s tocks and buy tax-exempts at such a favorable time?” Field offers no answer. N orman Dodd, who was then with Bankers Trust, states that Henry Morgenthau ca me into Bankers Trust a few days before the Crash, and ordered the officers to close out all securities of his trusts, $60 million, in three days. The officers t ried to remonstrate with him, pointing out that if he would sell them over a peri od of weeks, he would make much greater profits, perhaps five million dollars more than if they were disposed of on such short notice. Morgenthau became furious , screaming at them, “I didn't come here to argue with you ! Do as I say!” Black Friday occurred within the week. On May 30, 1936, Newsweek wrote about a Roosevelt appointee to the Federal Reserve Board, Ralph W. Morrison, “He sold his Texas utility stock to Insull for ten million dollars, and in 1929 called a meeting and ordered his banks to close out all security loans by Sept. 1. As a resu lt, they rode through the depression with flying colors.”"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"The insiders come through “with flying colors”, whi le millions of victims are ruined, destroyed by forces which they refuse to be lieve exist. Heartbreak, losses of homes and businesses, breakdowns, suicides, dest ruction of families, these are the results of World Order economic policies initia ted and carried out by “the rag and bone men”. Through its monetary command to the Federal Reserve Board, the World Order determines the outcome of American elections. A news commentator recently pointed out that Paul Volcker would determ ine whether Reagan would be re-elected. In 1980, the Federal Reserve Board del iberately defeated Carter and elected Reagan. Otto Eckstein noted in U.S. News, Sept. 5, 1983, that the prime rate reached 21.5% in late 1980, creating a recessi on in an election year. Eckstein, head of Data Resources in Lexington, Mass. (he late r died suddenly), said, “The Federal Reserve had never before made such a move.” Only the World Order knows whether the Federal Reserve will ride Reagan back into office in 1984 on a high tide of prosperity, or throw him out as the ne w Herbert Hoover. The more likely prospect is that he will be the Herbert Hoov er of 1986 or 1988. One critic pointed out that Volcker has boosted int erest rates, which hurts U.S. stocks, making short term U.S. money instrumen ts more desirable than long- term, and bringing about the very instability of fo reign capital flows which he claims to fear. Gordon Thether writes in The Londo n Financial Times , “In all history, there can be fewer instances of a man havi ng inflicted greater damage on the interests of his fellow human beings than Volck er has done with 'benigh neglect' and its all too many malignant manifestati ons – not the first of which is the ill-conceived gold demonetization campaign Washingt on has been engaged in since the late 60s. Interest rates rise when gold does n ot back currency.” Through the London Gold Pool, the Federal Reserve S ystem and the U.S. Treasury disposed of American gold at the giveway p rice of $35 an ounce, one tenth of its current value, robbing the American pu blic of billions of dollars. On July 24, 1969, Volcker authorized SDR paper gold, S pecial Drawing Rights, to replace gold in foreign exchange. He then triumpha ntly remarked to his fellow"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"bankers in Paris, “Well, we got this thing launched .” Secretary of the Treasury Connally then took the Nixon Administration off gol d, devaluing the dollar in August, 1971. On July 17, 1984, Jack Anderson described the Feder al Open Market Committee in the Washington Post as “a mysterious c ouncil of 12”, “the enigmatic group” with “excessive secrecy” who, says Anderson, “influence what rates you will pay, how much money will be available for business to borrow and whether inflation once again will eat up your earnings and reduce the value of your bank accounts.” Despite the far-reaching importance of “Volcker's” decisions, his testimony before Congress is shrouded in gobbledy-gook; this writer has gone through hundreds of pages of his testimony without finding a single quotable phrase about his economic intentions. On July 9, 1984, Jack And erson said of Volcker's meetings with high Treasury officials, “One of them , asked if he could recall anything Volcker had said during the high-level mee tings, thought a moment and replied, ‘I can't remember anything he said that I understood'.” Sen. Moynihan noted in the New Republic , Dec. 31, 1983, “The Fed does not control the precise money supply and cannot precise ly determine interest rates. But it can set the direction and range for both, an d this it did. Anyone who tried to dissent was soundly rapped. Its two dozen or so ce ntral bankers decided to bust the economy, and bust it they did.” Paul Craig Roberts writes in Businessweek , Feb. 27, 1984, “Whatever Volcker's intentions, the empirical data show that there has been a deceleration in money growth since last spring and that the Fed has been using open market operations to keep interest rates up.... What concerns the financ ial markets is the eclipse of Reagan's policies by Volcker's.... the most likely result will be higher taxes and higher deficits.” Nevertheless, the press and the Democrats attack Re agan as responsible for the deficit, over which he has no control, and whic h Volcker creates."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"The New York Times stated that whoever won the election in Nov. 1984, it has already been decided that taxes will be increas ed by $100 billion.

Its interference in the financial markets of America over the last d ecade has resulted in persistently excessive money growth, inflation which undermined the financial strength of U.S. corporations owing to the combined inflation and ex cessive rates of taxation, and record debt.” Forbes pointed out June 20, 1983 in a story about “Tony” Solomon, “Solomon may be the most important man in the Feder al Reserve System after the chairman, and what he says and does has an effect u pon us all.” Perhaps you have never heard of “Tony” Solomon. Ce rtainly you have never voted him into any office, yet what he says a nd does has an effect upon us all.

Fifty-three per cent of it s stock is held by five New York banks whose controlling influence is the London Hou se of Rothschild. The chairman of the FRBNY sits permanently on the FOMC at the right hand of the chairman of the Board of Governors. Sec. 12A of th e 1913 Federal Reserve Act provided that five representatives of the 12 Federa l Reserve Banks should rotate on the FOMG. This was quietly amended in August 1943, while World War II was raging, to read, “one elected annually by the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York” replacing the provision t hat “one should be elected annually by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and New York”.

In 1919, Moody wrote in “Masters of Capital”, “All of the great bankers beg an as dry goods traders, including Junius S. Morgan.” Beebe Morgan was a dr y goods house. J.M. Beebe Co. of Boston made Junius S. Morgan a partner. Jun ius Morgan was later invited to join George Peabody & Co. of London, which handl ed most of the House of Rothschild’s trading in American stocks. Junius Mo rgan’s son, J.P. Morgan, later changed the name of the firm to J.P. Morgan & Co., but it continued to one of three representatives of the House of Rothschild in the U.S., the others being Kuhn, Loeb & Co. and August Belmont.

Although these men were the most influential financ iers in the U.S., they were present at Jekyl Island merely as the emissari es of Baron Alfred Rothschild, who had commissioned them to prepare legislation es tablishing a central bank in the U.S., modelled on the European fractional reser ve central banking organizations of the Reichsbank, the Bank of Englan d, and the Bank of France, all of which were controlled by the House of Rothschild . To enact the Federal Reserve Act into the law of th e land, the bankers elected Woodrow Wilson president of the U.S. in 191 2 by splitting the Republican Party, defeating the popular William Howard Taft by financing Theodore Roosevelt’s malicious Bull Moose third party candid acy. Wilson’s academic career at Princeton had been financed by gifts from Clevel and H. Dodge, director of National City Bank, and Moses Taylor Pyne, grandson and heir of the founder of National City Bank. Wilson then signed an agreemen t not to go to any other college. The Federal Reserve Act was legislated th rough Congress as the Glass- Owen bill, backed by two Democrats, Congressman Car ter Glass of Virginia, and Sen. Robert Owen of Oklahoma. Owen was persuaded t o back the bill by Samuel Untermyer, who had cultivated him while acting as c ounsel for the Pujo Money Trust investigation. Untermyer flattered Owen by e ntertaining him at Greystone, his palatial Hudson River estate. Untermyer claime d to be a “progressive Democrat”, although he lived in feudal splendor, em ploying 167 men to tend his expanse of orchids and greenhouses. At Greystone, Owen dined with Paul Warburg, Bernard Baruch, and other financiers who h ad been instructed to get the Federal Reserve Act passed.

The May 19, 1914 organization chart of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that of the 203,053 shares issued, National City Bank took 30,000 shares; the Morgan- Baker First National Bank took 15,000 shares. These two banks merged into th e present Citibank in 1955, giving them one-fourth of the shares in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The $134 billion Citicorp is now the largest bank i n the U.S. The National Bank of Commerce of which Paul Warburg was a large sharehol der, took 21,000 shares; Hanover Bank (now Manufacturers Hanover, of which L ord Rothschild is a director,) took 10,200 shares; Chase National Bank took 6000 shares; Chemical Bank took 6000 shares. These six banks in 1914 own ed 40% of the stock of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Federal Rese rve System printout of shareholders July 26, 1983 showed that they now own 53%, as follows: Citibank 15%; Chase Manhattan 14%; Morgan Guaranty Trust 9% ; Manufacturers Hanover 7%; Chemical Bank 8%.

During a period when thousands of U.S. banks have g one bankrupt since 1914, these banks, protected by their interest in t he Federal Reserve Bank of New York, have grown steadily. A Senate Report, “Inter locking Directorates among the Major U.S. Corporations, a staff study of the Senat e Committee on Governmental Affairs,” June 15, 1978, shows that five of these a forementioned banks held a total of 470 interlocking directorates in the 130 major c orporations of the U.S., an average of 3.6 directors per major U.S. Corporation . This massive report is worthy of anyone’s detailed study; we can only give the to tals here: CITICORP 97 directorates J.P. MORGAN CO. 99 directorates CHEMICAL BANK 96 directorates CHASE MANHATTAN 89 directorates MANUFACTURERS HANOVER 89 directorates Total 470 This centralized control over American industry by five New York banks controlled from London suggests that instead of 130 major U.S. corporations, we may have only one, which in itself is an outpost of the London Connection. In the early 19th century, the House of Rothschild established a number of affiliates in the U.S. which carried the code ident ification of City banks, or City companies, identifying them as originating in the f inancial centre, the City of London. The City Bank was established in New York in 1812, in the same room in which the Bank of the United States had operated un til its charter expired. Later called the National City Bank, its principal for fi fty years was Moses Taylor, whose father had been a confidential agent for John Jacob Astor and British intelligence. Like the Morgan-Peabody operation, Moses Taylor dou bled his fortune in the"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Panic of 1837 by purchasing stock in the depressed market with capital advanced by N.M. Rothschild of London. During the Panic of 1857, while many of its competitors failed, City Bank prospered. Moses Tay lor purchased the outstanding stock of Delaware Lackawanna Railroad for $5 a shar e during the panic. Seven years later, it was worth $240 a share. He was now worth $50 million. His son-in- law, Percy Pyne, had come from London to work at Ci ty Bank, and married Taylor’s daughter. When Taylor died in 1882, he le ft $70 million. His son-in-law, now paralyzed, became president of the now National City Bank. John D. Rockefeller’s brother William invested in the bank, and persuaded Pyne to step aside in 1891 in favor of James Stillman, Rockefell er’s associate, to become president. William’s son William married Stillman’ s daughter Elsie; his other son Percy married Stillman’s daughter Isabelle. James Stillman also had a London connection – his father, Don Carlos, had been a Rot hschild agent in Brownsville, Texas and a successful blockade runner during the C ivil War. The National City Bank acquired several subsidiarie s in New York, the National City Co., later renamed the City Co., and City Bank Farmers Trust Co. The dominance of the Morgan-Kuhn Loeb financial pow er in New York is shown by a Dow Jones report in the New York Times F eb. 11, 1928 that of total offerings of bonds in 1927, J.P. Morgan was first w ith $502,590,000; National City Co. was second with $435,616,000; Kuhn Loeb was th ird with $423,988,000. On July 3,1929, the New York Times noted that Charles A. Peabody had joined the boards of National City Co. and City Bank Farmers T rust. On Aug. 4, 1932, the New York Times stated that National City Bank would issue its own currency against U.S. bonds carrying the circulatory power u nder the new Federal Home Loan Bank Act which empowered National City Bank to issue up to $124 million in currency. The National City Bank had now become a “bank of issue”, a function formerly reserved to central banks. On Ju ne 8, 1933, James H.

The Times also noted that National City Bank had organized United Aircraft Feb. 2, 1934, and that its subsidiary, City Bank Fa rmers Trust had celebrated its 112th anniversary on Feb. 28, 1929. On June 27, 1934, the City Co. of New York was desi gnated German bond scrip agent in the U.S. On May 22, 1933, City Co. of N.Y. announced its merger with Brown Bros. Harriman, with Joseph Ripley as ch airman of the board. The company went through several name changes as Brown Harriman Co., Harriman Ripley, and is now Brown Bros. Harriman once more. On March 4, 1934, Gen. Billy Mitchell, addressing t he Foreign Policy Association, stated that National City Bank and its affiliates control aviation in this country. Allen W. Dulles, introduced as a “special ist in international affairs” announced the profits of international munitions ma kers were unconscionable. On March 2, 1955, National City Bank announced it w ould purchase the stock of First National Bank for $165 million, $550 a share (in the 1929 boom, First National sold for $8600 share). Some market analysts believed the stock should have brought $750 a share in the 1955 sale, suggesting that the Baker family was no longer able to protect its interests. The r esulting Citibank became the largest bank in the U.S., with a controlling intere st in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. National City Bank had been in Hong Kong for eighty years; it has a $90 million Citibank Centre there. In 1983, 4% of its annual profits came from the Hong Kong operation, which is the center of the wor ld’s drug trade. Besides its controlling interest in the Federal Res erve Bank of New York, the Rothschilds had developed important financial inter ests in other parts of the United States.

The House St aff Report discloses that Rothschild Intercontinental Bank Ltd. has three pri ncipal American subsidiaries: National City Bank of Cleveland; First City Nation al Bank of Houston (First City Bancorp); and Seattle First National Bank. These Rothschild subsidiaries were ranked in 1983 as follows: First City Bancorp Houst on, 23rd in size in U.S., $17 billion assets; National City Corp. of Cleveland, 48th largest in U.S., $6.5 billion assets. National City Corporation of Cleveland has exercised a dominant role in Midwestern industry and politics for many years; F irst City Bancorp dominates Texas oil and heavy industry as well as Texas polit ics. In 1900, Cleveland was the home of Marcus Alonzo Ha nna (known as Mark), the legendary political boss of the Republic an Party. He twice nominated and elected an Ohio Congressman, William McKinley, to the Presidency of the U.S. He initiated the checkoff system by which ban ks and corporations were required to make regular political contributions.

M.A. Hanna Co. the holding company, was liquidated in 19 65, and its $700 million assets distributed to its stockholders. The National City Bank of Cleveland’s influence was not limited to the Hanna and Humphrey families. As the Ohio Connectio n of the House of Rothschild, it guided the careers of two of the nat ion’s best known families, the Tafts and the Rockefellers. The bank financed the Taft family’s activities in politics and business, the Taft Broadcasting Co. and other f irms. John D. Rockefeller’s success began when he obtained the backing of the N ational City Bank of Cleveland to finance his takeover of his competitor s in the oil business. Because J.P. Morgan and Kuhn, Loeb Co. controlled 95% of al l railway mileage in the U.S. in the latter half of the 19th century, they offere d Rockefeller special rebates on shipping oil through his holding company, South Imp rovement Co. This enabled him to undersell and ruin his competitors. One of them was a Mr. Tarbell, whose daughter, Ida Tarbell, later wrote the first expose of Standard Oil and was termed a “muckraker” by Theodore Roosevelt, a term which pro mptly went into the language. The entire Rockefeller empire was financ ed by the Rothschilds. When Lincoln Steffens became a Wall Street reporter , he interviewed both J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller on several occa sions. He soon realized that these gentlemen, powerful though they were, were me re front men. He noted that “No one ever seems to ask the question ‘who is behi nd the Morgans and the Rockefellers ?’” No one else ever asked the questi on, nor did anyone answer it ! Steffens knew the money for their operations was co ming from someone else, but never managed to trace it. In February 1930, one of the few articles on the Ro thschilds ever to appear in an American magazine appeared in Fortune , which stated, “On only one important point did the Rothschilds guess wrong. T hey never would have anything to do with the U.S. of America. Imagination falter s at what the Rothschilds might"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"be today if they had spent on the infant industries of this country one-half the sums they poured into Imperial Austria.” The Fortune writer did not know then and probably never knew t hat the Rothschilds have always controlled the Morgan and R ockefeller operations, as well as the foundations set up by these front men to con trol the people of the United States. During the past quarter of a century, many writers have published alarming exposes of the Rockefellers and their control of th e U.S. through the Council on Foreign Relations. In 1950, the New York Times car ried a small notice on an inside page that L.L. Strauss, a partner of Kuhn, L oeb Co., had been appointed financial advisor to the Rockefeller brothers. In short, all their investments must be approved by a partner of Kuhn, Loeb Co. It has always been thus, beginning with Jacob Schiff. Strauss held the position from 1950 to 1953, when it passed to J. Richardson Dilworth. Dilworth, who married Elizabe th Cushing, was a partner of Kuhn, Loeb Co. from 1946 to 1958, when he became di rector of Finances for the entire Rockefeller family, presiding over all their accounts on the 56th floor of Rockefeller Center. He held the position until 198 1. He is now Chairman of the Board of Rockefeller Center, director of Internatio nal Basic Economy Corp., Chrysler, R.H.

For many years, its primary law firm has been Jones, Day, Reavis and Pogue of Cleveland.

J. Evetts Haley pointed out that Brown & Root prospered on government contr acts after Johnson helped them and rapidly became a worldwide operation. In 1940, the Internal Revenue Service found that large contributions given to Joh nson by Brown & Root and its subsidiary, Victoria Gravel Co., as much as $100,00 0 each, were taken by Brown & Root as tax deductions. Haley states, “Brown & Roo t were in control of Texas politics; that L.B. Johnson was in control of IRS; that records had been burned at IRS to get Brown off the hook in 1954.

Morgan d id not leave one of the great American fortunes when he died in 1913; it w as first estimated at $75 million, then 50, and finally disclosed there were only $19 million of securities in the entire estate, of which $7 million was owed to the art dea ler Duveen. J.P. Morgan Jr. (known to a very few intimates as Jack) was embarra ssed to find he had to sell off many of his father’s art treasures to pay the debts of the estate. Most of the huge sums handled by J.P. Morgan went directly to the Ro thschilds. In 1905, the New York Times noted in its obituary of Baron Alphonse de Rothschild that he possessed some $60 million in American securities, although the Rothschilds, according to most financial authorities, had never been active in American finance. Lincoln Steffens noted, “Senator Aldrich is a great man to me; not personally, but as leader of the Senate. He, Aldri ch, bows to J.P. Morgan. The other day J.P. Morgan came to Washington, and he an d I and Aldrich had a conference. And I noticed how he, Morgan, addresse d himself to me, not to Aldrich. Morgan talked to me, while I talked to Al drich, who talked to Morgan.” Morgan’s partner, George W. Perkins, worked furious ly to obtain Theodore Roosevelt’s nomination as McKinley’s running mate. During Roosevelt’s presidency, his closest advisor was George W. Perki ns. Despite Roosevelt’s nickname of “trustbuster”, he protected Morgan’s in terests throughout his term of office. His successor, William Howard Taft, was op posed to Morgan, and introduced anti-trust legislation to control two Mo rgan trusts, International Harvester and U.S. Steel. Perkins then created the Progressive Party in 1912 to split the party and defeat Taft. J.P. Morgan’s apex of power was attained in the Pan ic of 1907, when he assumed control of Wall Street. Oakleigh Thorne, p resident of the Trust Co. of America, a victim of the “panic”, testified before a Congressional Committee that his bank had been subjected to only moderate withdr awals, that he had not applied for help, and that it was Morgan’s ‘sore point’ sta tement alone that had caused the"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"run on his bank...... “that Morgan interests took a dvantage of the unsettled conditions during the autumn of 1907 to precipitate the panic, guiding it shrewdly as it progressed so that it would kill off rival ba nks and consolidate the preeminence of the banks within the Morgan orbit.” Morgan’s financial power came from control of the e normous cash flow of the nation’s biggest life insurance companies. He gained control of Mutual Life, New York Life, Metropolitan Life, and with George F . Baker and James Stillman, bought controlling interest in Equitable from Thoma s Fortune Ryan, who had acquired it from the Hyde family. Hyde originally set Equitable up while acting as a front for Jacob Schiff and James Speyer. On June 7, 1933, Nation noted “J.P. Morgan is generally regarded as the most prominent banker in the world.” Paul Y. Ander son mentioned in this article that testimony before the Senate Banking Committee showed that Morgan and his partners, including Thomas W. Lamont and E.T. Stote sbury, paid no federal income tax in 1931-32; the partners paid a total o f $48,000 in 1930. Anderson remarked, “Is there any mystery as to why the Marin es were despatched against Haiti, San Domingo, and Nicaragua when those countr ies defaulted, or threatened to default, on the debt payments to American banks ? It has been shown that the Morgan firm had a certain selected list of ‘clients ’ to whom it sold stock at figures substantially under market prices. In the case of the Allegheny Corp. these fair- haired boys got the stock at 20, when the market wa s 35.” Anderson pointed out that these fortunate few could have sold the stock immediately for almost double what they had paid. Among the recipients of these Morgan favors he listed Senator McAdoo, Justice Owen Roberts, Secretary Woodin, Owe n D. Young, and John J. Raskob. In Nation , June 21, 1933, Anderson continued, “When Ft. Sumt er was fired on, gold began to leave the country. The man who l ater said ‘Don’t sell America short’ then took a flyer on the short side of Ameri ca. He borrowed 2 million in gold coins and shipped it to London. This was real ly a blow behind the lines. Then he went to the ‘gold room’ to watch the effect . There was a scramble for"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"gold to pay commitments abroad and this patriotic A merican with 2 million in eagles in London sold at his own price.” In March, 1929, perhaps in preparation for the comi ng storm, two Morgan banks merged, the National Bank of Commerce, which, according to the New York Times had “important foreign connections”, and Guaranty Trust, forming a $2 billion institution. On Feb. 26, 1929, the New York Times noted, “The Guaranty Trust has long been known as one of the ‘Morgan gro up’. The National Bank of Commerce has also been identified with Morgan inter ests.” J.P. Morgan’s longtime associate, George Fisher Bak er, was one of the founders of First National Bank, purchasing 30 shar es in 1863 for $3000. He also was cashier, and later became president. Sheridan A. Logan’s book, “George F. Baker and his Bank”, privately printed, 1981, noted that “a European syndicate headed by N.M. Rothschild was represented in New Yo rk by August Belmont and First National Bank to refund the Government debt. Baker wrote a letter Aug. 29, 1876, ‘I have to advise you that our negotiations w ith the Treasury Dept. resulted in a contract between Messrs. N.M. Rothschild & Son s and others and the Secretary of the Treasury for the purpose of forty million dollars of U.S. 4½ per cents of 1891, with an option on the remainder, $26 0 million. In this contract the bank participated to the extent of 10%, $4 million. ” Logan also states that “In 1901 Baker sold to J.P. Morgan $23 million stock in Central Railroad of New Jersey. The mutual conf idence and respect which developed between Mr. Baker and Mr. Morgan cemented their increasingly close relationship and the First National Bank became mor e and more the unswerving ally and valuable source of mobile funds for the wo rk of J.P. Morgan & Co.” In 1901, Baker increased the stock of First Nationa l Bank from $500,000 to $10 million by a 1900% stock dividend. He organize d First Security Co., a holding company, with this dividend. During the 1929 boom, Baker’s personal fortune reached the $500 million mark. His son, George Jr. pleaded with him to pay of the $29 million owed on stocks in First Security’s $80 million portfolio. Baker, then 89 years old, had not been informed of the planned cre dit contraction, possibly"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"because the insiders feared he might gossip about i t. He continued to refuse to sell any stocks; the crash of 1929 reduced his fortune to $200 million. When he died in 1931, the estate was appraised at $73 million; his son, George Jr. inherited $30 million. His health had been shattered by the stra in of working with his father during the desparate days of 1929, and he died of a heart attack in Honolulu, aged 59. His son, George F. III was found shot at Horse shoe Plantation, Fla. in 1977. George III’s son, Grenville, was found shot at Tall ahassee, Fla. in 1949, at age 33. George Jr.’s daughter, Edith Brevoort Baker, marrie d Jacob Schiffs grandson, John Mortimer Schiff, in 1939, uniting two of America’s largest fortunes. George Baker I’s daughter Florence had married Howard Bligh St. George in 1891, member of one of England’s oldest families. Their granddaugh er Priscilla married Angier Biddle Duke in 1937, and second, Allen A. Ryan Jr. in 1941, a relative of the Delanos. In 1935, Gen. Smedley D. Butler wrote in the Nov. i ssue of Common Sense of his Marine career, “I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe f or American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in.... I helped purify Nic aragua for the international banking house of Brown Bros. in 1909-12. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went its way unmolested. In 1899 J.P. Morgan floated the first important foreign loan on behalf of the Mexican Gov ernment. In 1901 he lent $50 million to the British Government to fight the Boer War. But it was mainly into the countries of Spanish America that American capi tal found its way.” Butler continued his revelations in the Dec. 1935 i ssue, “In 1910, six months after the Nicaraguan Revolution which ousted Presid ent Zelaya, his successor, Dr. Madris, grew cold towards the Nicaraguan investment s of Brown Bros. and Seligman Co. Another revolution immediately ‘occurr ed’.” Butler mentions the Latin American activities of Br own Bros., now Brown Bros. Harriman, a firm little known to most America ns. In 1801, a linen auctioneer"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"from Belfast, Alexander Brown, established a bankin g house, Alexander Brown & Co. in the slavetrading port of Baltimore. It is n ow the oldest banking house in the U.S. Its English branch, Brown Shipley, also became influential, its most wellknown member being Lord Montague Norman, Govern or of the Bank of England for many years, 1907-44, longer than any ot her man in history. Current Biography 1940, noted, “There is an informal understanding t hat a director of Brown Shipley should be on the board of the Bank of Engla nd and Norman was elected to it in 1907.” In expanding Rothschild investments in U.S. railroa ds, Kuhn, Loeb Co. found a useful agent in E.H. Harriman. A young man on the make, Harriman married the daughter of the president of a small Ne w York railroad, and soon looked for more worlds to conquer. George Redmond writes in “Financial Giants of America” “He (Harriman) early won the confidence of Kuhn, Loeb Co. and established relations which later became most advan tageous to both.” Kuhn, Loeb financed the Union Pacific takeover by Harriman. H .J. Eckenrode notes in “E.H. Harriman”, “In his takeover of UP, Harriman had beh ind him tremendous financial force – not only Kuhn, Loeb Co. with fund s from Frankfurt and Berlin, but the National City Bank, ‘the greatest source of cash in the country’.” Harriman employed judge Robert Scott Lovett as gene ral counsel for Union Pacific. When Harriman and Otto Kahn were summoned by the ICC in 1897, Lovett advised them to refuse to answer all questio ns about their stock operations. In 1908, the Supreme Court upheld their refusal to talk. The records of this case, SC No. 133 US v. UP RR, later disappeared from the Library of Congress. In 1911, the Equitable Life Insurance building, which contained all the records of the UP RR, burned, destroying all UP papers to that dat e. Lovett’s son, Robert Abercrombie Lovett married Adele Brown, daughter of a partner of Brown Bros. and became partner in 1926. He was Special Asst. S ec. of War 1940-45, under secretary of state, 1947-49, dep. secretary of Defe nse 1950-51, secretary of Defense 1951-53. It was Lovett who took the then Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, of Dillon Read Co. to Fishers Island to persuade him t o change his stand against U.S."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Middle Eastern policies. Forrestal refused, and wa s placed in a mental ward at the National Institute of Health, where he fell out of the window. Lovett then replaced him as Secretary of Defense. Brown Bros. backed the B & O steamship line in 1887 , and went into joint venture with J & W Seligman Co. on a number of Sout h American loans. In 1915, Brown Bros. combined with J.P. Morgan to float a se ries of Latin American loans, which in many instances were followed by revolution s in the respective countries. In the Nation , June 7, 1922, Oswald Garrison Villard noted, “The Republic of Brown Bros with J & W Seligman had reduced Haiti, S anto Domingo, and Nicaragua to the status of colonies with ruinous lo ans. Most of the loans were repaid in 1924.” In 1931, W. Averell Harriman, son of E.H. Harriman, merged his banking house, W.A. Harriman & Co. with Brown Bros. to form the present firm of Brown Bros. Harriman. In 1933, Brown Bros. Harriman back ed the expansion of CBS, in which they have maintained a large position. The B rown Bros. firm occupied offices on the corner of Wall Street and Hanover wh ich had been occupied by J.L. & J.S. Joseph Co., the American representatives of the Rothschilds. Josephs went broke in the Panic of 1837, having been cut loose b y the Rothschilds, who were now operating through August Belmont and George Pea body & Co. W. Averell Harriman brought to the new firm his vice president , Prescott Sheldon Bush, who had been with him since 1926. Bush became chairman of the Board of Pennsylvania Water & Power Co., director U.S. Rubbe r, PanAm, CBS, Dresser Mfg Co. Vanadium, U.S. Guaranty, Prudential Insurance a nd partner Brown Bros Harriman.

He is a trustee of Yale. Ge orge H. Walker III merged the firm of G.H. Walker Co. with Laird & Co. and White & Weld in 1974. He is now a senior vice pres. of White & Weld. Harriman was the go-between of Churchill and Roosev elt’s World War II alliance. The two leaders did not know or particul arly like each other; each of them conferred with W. Averell Harriman about how t o talk to the other, and carefully followed his advice. W.A. Harriman served as U.S. Ambassador at large du ring World War II, principally in Moscow with Stalin; his brother E. Roland was president of the American Red Cross; Robert A. Lovett was Secretary of Defense. Harriman was related by marriage to Wild Bill Donovan, founder o f the OSS. Brown Bros has always maintained close relations wi th British firms. James Brown, partner from 1935-50 was director Northern A ssurance of London, Sun Insurance, pres. British Empire Club and National B ank of Nicaragua. Thatcher M.

Brown Bros. had loaned the City of Berlin $15 million on 6% 30 yr. bonds a nd Mr. Roesler, who comp.eted details of the transaction said that ‘it was the bi ggest loan to a city in Europe since 1914’.”"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"The New York Times later noted, “Word was received here yesterday by J.

This good news w as somewhat palled by the Times report that a syndicate had been formed to handle this stock since “Capt.

Informed observers believed it was Zaharoff himself who dethroned the pretender to his title as “mystery man of Europe”. Lowenstein had become involved in a desperate struggle with Zaharoff and his associate, Dreyfus Clavell, to control the artificial silk industry in Europe. Af ter Lowenstein’s accident, his two associates in this struggle also died mysteriously. M.M. Ayrich had an automobile accident on a deserted road, with no witnesses. Lo wenstein’s third associate, Prince Radziwill, was poisoned by a woman friend, a ccording to a French journal, La Crapoulle ."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"W. Averill Harriman was 78 when his wife died. A y ear later, Katharine Meyer Graham, publisher of the Washington Post , invited him to a party to meet Pam Churchill, daughter of Lord Digby, an English horse fancier. She had been married to Randolph Churchill, and was mother of the presen t Winston Churchill. She then married into the first family of Hollywood, pr oducer Leland Hayward, formerly married to actress Margaret Sullavan. In Haywire , her autobiography, Brooke Hayward describes her stepmother as “a cold- blooded golddigger who made off with her mother’s jewels”. Pam dated Elie de Rothschild before deciding to marry Harriman. They are now the dominant figur es in the Democratic Party. Harriman has given $15 million to the Russian Insti tute at Columbia, (now the Harriman Institute). Another prominent banking house is the firm of Dill on Read. Clarence Dillon (1882-1979) was born in San Antonio, Texas, son of Samuel and Bertha Lapowski or Lapowitz. He graduated from Harvard in 1905, married Anne Douglass of Milwaukee, whose father owned Milwaukee Machine & Tool Co. They went abroad from 1908 to 1910. Their son, C. Douglas Dillon, was born in Switzerland in 1909. In 1912, Dillon met William A . Read, founder of a wellknown Wall Street bond brokerage, through a Harvard class mate. They became partners. Read died suddenly in 1916, and Dillon bought contr ol of the firm. During World War I, Dillon served as Bernard Baruch’s righthand man at the War Industries Board. In 1915, Dillon had set up American & Forei gn Securities Corp. to finance the French Government’s purchases of munitions in t he U.S. His righthand man at Dillon Read was James A.

Second to the Rothschilds, the Warburgs were consid ered the most important international banking family of the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1798, two sons of Marcus Gumprich Warburg, Moses Marcus a nd Gerson W. founded M.M. Warburg Co. in Hamburg. They were descendants of Simon von Cassel, a 16th century moneylender and pawnbroker. They were also direct descendants of Abraham del Banco, largest banker in Venice. When they moved north, they took the name of Warburg, after Cassel settled in this W estphalian town. In 1814, the Warburgs became one of the first affiliates of N.M. Rothschild of London. They were related to the leading banking families of Eur ope, the Rosenbergs of Kiev, the Gunzburgs in St. Petersburg, the Oppenheims and Gol dschmidts in Germany. Moritz Warburg was apprenticed to the Rothschilds i n Italy and Paris, and later married Charlotte Oppenheim, whose family were diam ond merchants in Frankfort. They had five sons, known as “the Five Hamburgers”; the oldest, Aby, founded the Warburg Institute; Max financed the Ge rman struggle in World War I and later, the Nazi regime; Dr. Fritz Warburg was German commercial attache in Stockholm during World War I; Paul and Felix emigr ated to America and joined the firm of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. with Jacob Schiff, who had been born in the Rothschild house in Frankfort. Paul wrote the Fede ral Reserve Act and saw it through Congress. He represented the U.S. at the V ersailles Peace Conference, while his brother Max represented German interests. The Memoirs of Max Warburg state, “The Kaiser thumped the tabl e violently and shouted ‘Must you always be right?’, but then l istened carefully to Max’s view of financial matters.” M.M.

At the second annual convention of the American Acceptance Counci l, Dec. 2, 1920, President Paul Warburg said, “It is a great satisfaction to r eport that during the year under review it was possible for the American Acceptance Council to further develop and strengthen its relations with the Federal Reserve S vstem.” He did not add that as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board from 191 4-18, he had organized the Federal Reserve System, or that he served as presid ent of the Federal Advisory Council from 1918-27, which actually formulated pol icy for the Board.

There was no question of their marriage – he was looking for a rich wife, sh e was looking for a rich husband – they began a relationship which lasted for years. Donovan also courted Blanche Lopez, of a wealthy tobacco family, who lived in Ru mson, N.J. He then returned to Buffalo, where he opened a law practice. He met Ruth Rumsey, and abruptly dropped Blanche Lopez, never contacting her again. Ruth Rumsey was heiress of one of the richest families in America. Her father , Dexter Rumsey, and her uncle Bronson owned 22 of Bufflao’s 43 square miles. In 1890, Dexter Rumsey was worth $10 million. His wife was a member of the we althy Hazard family of Rhode Island, who had owned one thousand slaves, and were the largest slave owners in America. The Rumseys were Masters of the Genesee V alley Hunt, the most exclusive hunt club in the U.S. Dexter Rumsey died in 1906, leaving his son and daughter 12½% each of his fortune in trust. Bill D onovan’s courtship of Ruth Rumsey was complicated by the reappearance in Buffa lo of Eleanor Robson, now Mrs. August Belmont. She turned up at the Studio C lub, an acting group run by Katharine Cornell’s father, where Donovan had the j uvenile lead. La Robson requested that Donovan come to her suite in New Yor k each weekend for “drama lessons”. Donovan then took the long train ride to New York City each weekend, causing considerable gossip in Buffalo, where he wa s already widely known for his philandering. Nevertheless, Ruth Rumsey had determ ined to marry him, probably because her family was so strongly opposed. Friend s of the family stated that had Dexter Rumsey lived, he would never have allowed th is marriage to take place, because of Donovan’s age; he was 31; his religion , Irish Catholic; and his philandering. The Rumseys were Episcopalian, but D onovan persuaded his wife to"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"bring up their children as Roman Catholics. His br other was a priest. After the marriage, Donovan and his wife moved into the Rumse y family mansion at 742 Delaware Ave. in Buffalo. Because of his New York connections, the Rockefelle r Foundation selected Donovan to go to Europe on a “War Relief Mission” i n 1915, the first of many assignments from the World Order. He was to be sep arated from Ruth Donovan continually during the next three years. While in London, he worked with Ambassador Walter Nelson Page, William Stephenson, who later “advised” him on setting up the OSS, and Herbert Hoover. Donovan sp ent five weeks in Belgium as an observer with Hoover’s Belgian Relief Commission . When the U.S. entered World War I, Donovan helped o rganize the “Rainbow” Division, and was given command of the “F ighting 69th”. He fought at Landes et Landes St. George, in the Meuse-Argonn e sector, where, although wounded, he charged a German machine gun squad on O ct. 15, 1918 with his bayonet. For this feat, he was awarded the Congres sional Medal of Honor. His bravery was the subject of wide publicity in the Am erican press, and Current Biography later stated he was the most famous man i n the A.E.F. He was with Joyce Kilmer, the poet, when Kilmer was shot down. In 1919 and 1920, Donovan was sent on secret missions to China and Siberia. After the war, J.P. Morgan established the Foreign Commercial Corp. to float $2 billion in bonds in postwar Europe. In Fe bruary, 1920, he asked Donovan to make a secret tour of Europe to obtain intellige nce relating to these bonds. Cave Brown described this mission, “Having helped t o finance the war, Morgan wished to help finance the peace by expanding the H ouse of Morgan’s interests widely ..... These activities required the best int elligence from the best sources in Europe. Donovan and the Rainbow Division intellige nce officer, Grayson Mallet- Prevost Murphy, had been retained by John Lord O’Br ian’s firm to obtain that intelligence, working in secrecy.” Morgan reported ly paid Donovan $200,000 for this operation."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"During his European reconnaissance, Donovan met Ado lf Hitler at Berchtesgaden, and spent an evening with him in his room at Pension Moritz. Donovan later claimed he had not known who Hitler w as, but that he found him a “fascinating talker”. In 1922, Donovan was appointed U.S. District Attorn ey for New York. In 1924, Atty. Gen. Harlan F. Stone, Donovan’s Columbi a law professor, asked him to come to Washington as Asst. Atty. Gen. Donovan and his wife bought a house in Georgetown (later the home of Katharine Meyer) a t 1637 30th St. Donovan’s first official act was to demand that Stone fire J. Edgar Hoover from the Bureau of Investigation. Instead, Stone, who was Hoover’s pa tron as well as Donovan’s, appointed Hoover Director of the Bureau of Investig ation Dec. 18, 1924. Donovan also became involved in another political football, the prosecution of Senator Burton K. Wheeler. Wheeler was defended by Senator Tom Walsh, one of the most powerful politicians in Washington, but Donova n, against all advice to the contrary, insisted on proceeding with the prosecuti on. It was said that the charges against Wheeler were “ludicrous”, and Stone asked D onovan to drop the case, but he stubbornly proceeded to indict Wheeler before a District of Columbia grand jury. When the case was tried in Great Falls, the jury deliberated only ten minutes before bringing in a verdict of acquittal for Wheel er. Such a boner would have destroyed the careers of mo st men in Washington, but Donovan was under the protection of Herbert Hoo ver, his associate from World War I. Between 1924 and 1928, he was Hoover’ s closest associate. Hoover took him to the Bohemian Club, the sacrosanct West Coast powerhouse where he was the directing figure. Hoover then persuaded Pr esident Coolidge to appoint Donovan to the Colorado River Commission, a seven s tate authority which organized the proposals for the Hoover Dam (later r enamed the Boulder Dam by FDR, and still later, renamed the Hoover Dam by Act of Congress in 1947.) During the 1920s, Republican politicians favored th e nomination of Dawes for president. Although it seemed that he was backing a sure loser, Donovan worked as Hoover’s top strategist for four years. When Ho over was nominated on the first"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"ballot at the Republican Convention (a tribute to t he power of the Rothschilds), Donovan wrote his acceptance speech. It was unders tood that Donovan was to be Hoover’s running mate. However, Hoover immediately realized that because he was running against Al Smith, a Roman Catholic, he would lose the massive anti- catholic vote if he picked Donovan, also a Roman Ca tholic, as his running mate. Hoover had no intention of losing his trump card in the forthcoming election. He cast Donovan aside without a second thought, and ev en refused to consider him for a cabinet post, such as Attorney General, proba bly the only time in American politics that the architect of a successful Preside ntial campaign was denied a position on the team or in the Cabinet. The disheartened Donovan decided to forego politica l life. In 1929, he organized the law firm of Donovan, Leisure, Newton and Irvine, with offices at 2 Wall St. He also took a 23 room suite at the Shore ham Hotel for the firm’s Washington offices. During ensuing years, Donovan rarely saw his wife, although they were never legally separated. Dunlop’s biogra phy of Donovan notes that “He always had his pick of feminine admirers. To many of the women he met, Donovan was irresistible.” Ruth Donovan stayed at their summer home on the South Shore of Massachusetts, or at their New York apartment on Beekman Place. Despite his disappointment with Hoover, Donovan con tinued to take an active role in national politics. He ran Knox’s ca mpaign for the Republican nomination in 1936, and his firm defended American Telephone and Telegraph in an anti-trust suit by the government. Donovan won handily, which brought in a new influx of business to his firm. In 1937, Donovan renewed his association with the R othschilds. The Viennese branch of the family had lost extensive ho ldings in Bohemia when the Nazis moved into Czechoslovakia. Because Donovan h ad already established a network of informants in the highest echelons of th e Nazi government, including Admiral Canaris, the Rothschilds asked him to salva ge their interests. He went to Germany to argue their case, but despite his import ant contacts, he was defeated by Hitler’s view of the Rothschilds as a symbol of wha t he hoped to achieve in his"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"battle against “the international bankers”. The Ro thschilds were not overly concerned; they knew that World War II was on its way, and that the outcome had been decided in advance. Donovan won another important legal victory in 1937 , when he and a staff of 57 lawyers defended 18 oil firms against anti-tr ust charges. His clients were let off with nominal fines, and once again Donovan was considered the winner. His German contacts now invited him to observe the Nuremberg maneuvers, as a guest of the German General Staff. He also accompanied them on a trip to observe the progress of the Spanish Civil War. Although he was there as an invited guest of “the Fascists”, Donovan was soo n to build the OSS around the hard core of the Communist Lincoln Brigade. He met Kim Philby in Spain, who was writing about the Civil War as a “pro-Nazi” jou rnalist, a pose he carried off successfully despite his recent marriage to Litzi F riedmann, a fanatical Communist and Zionist provocateur. On April 10, 1940, Donovan’s daughter, Patricia wre cked her car near Fredericksburg, Va. and was killed. She was his on ly daughter; there was also one son, David, who married Mary Grandin, Patricia’s ro ommate at boarding school, and heiress of a wealthy Philadelphia family. Asso ciates said that Donovan never got over his daughter’s death. Because he had rece ived the Congressional Medal of Honor, Patricia was buried in Arlington National Ce metery. His grief-stricken wife left for a round the world cruise on Irving Johnson ’s ship, Yankee . On May 29, 1940, William Stephenson arrived in New York with a letter to Donovan from Admiral Blinker Hall, a British Naval Intelligence officer whom Donovan had met in 1916. The letter proposed an Am erican intelligence agency, although we were not at war. Franklin D. Roosevelt sent Donovan to London with orders to develop this program, as an “unoffic ial observer”. Despite efforts at secrecy, there was widespread journalistic speculat ion about his mission for Roosevelt. He then made a tour of southeast Europe for the President, gauging the status of the German occupied countries. Altho ugh this was an obvious"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"espionage mission, the Germans placed no obstacles in his path. They were anxious to maintain good relations with the United States. After Donovan delivered his report to the President , he was named Coordinator of Information by the White House. Bec ause he had had no experience in propaganda work, the office was later split into the Office of War Information, Executive Order 9128, and the Office o f Strategic Services, Military Order of June 13, 1942. Donovan was placed in char ge of the OSS. The “new” agency was from the outset merely an outp ost of British Intelligence. On Sept. 18, 1941, Col. E.I. Jacob, Churchill’s military secretary, was informed by Maj. Desmond Morton Church, Churchill’s liason with the British secret service, “Another most secret fact of which the Prime Minist er is aware is that to all intents and purposes U.S. Security is being run for them at the President’s request by the British. A British officer sits in Washington with Mr. Edgar Hoover and General Bill Donovan for this purpose. It is of course ess ential that this fact should not be known.” For some months, Donovan had been living in a suite at the St. Regis Hotel in New York. He and William Stephenson had been me eting regularly since 1940 to organize the new agency. Stephenson was working directly under Col. Stewart Menzies, head of Special Operations Executive, the top British intelligence agency. As cover, Menzies was Colonel in the Life Guards, t he escort troop of the King. Stephenson was head of SIS, (Special Intelligence S ection). When Donovan had left for London July 15, 1940 on his mission for Ro osevelt, Stephenson had wired London, “Col. Wm. J. Donovan, personally representi ng the President, left yesterday by clipper. U.S. Embassy not, repeat, no t being informed.” This was a replay of the House-Wilson-Wiseman opera tion during World War I. Not only were the American people left in t he dark, but concerned agencies were never told what the conspirators had planned. Donovan’s London mission was a slap in the face to the U.S. Ambassador, Jose ph Kennedy. Roosevelt called"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Donovan “my secret legs”, and he assured Stephenson in a private interview, “I’m your biggest undercover agent.” In “A Man Called Intrepid”, Stephenson is quoted as saying that after April, 1939, “The President was one of us.” It was also i n 1939 that Roosevelt privately told Mackenzie King, Prime Minister of Canada and a longtime Rockefeller agent, “Our frontier is on the Rhine.” This same book quo tes Churchill as saying, on the eve of war, “We need Rockefeller and Rothschild.” Stephenson replied, “I can find the Rockefellers and they’ll support us. We can of fer our secret intelligence in return for help.” Indeed, the Rockefellers gave Stephenson an entire floor rent free at Rockefeller Center, where the agency has operated e ver since. A later book, “Intrepid’s Last Case” notes that “What some would later call the secret SIS Secret Occupation of Manhattan began in 1990. By 1941, J. Edgar Hoover was complaining that the Rockefeller Center headquarter s of British Security Coordination controlled an army of British secret a gents, a group of nine distinct secret agencies. Attorney General Biddle was quote d as saying ‘The truth is nobody knows anything about what Stephenson does’.” Had “anyone” known, Stephenson would have had to be arrested and deported. German sailors were being deliberately m urdered by Stephenson’s provocateurs in New York as acts designed to force Hitler to declare war against the United States. The INTREPID file in SOE (Steph enson’s cover name) described it as “a reign of terror conducted by spe cially trained agents and fortified by espionage and intelligence in Occupied Europe.” Every act of Donovan and Stephenson was a violation of American neutrality. Donovan’s law office at 2 Wall Street was next to the Passport Control Office. He had special passports prepared for Stephenson’s British agents. Stephenson had of fices at three locations, Hampshire House, Dorset Hotel, and Rockefeller Cent er. Allen Dulles had opened a branch office of Coordinator of Information at Ro ckefeller Center in 1940. He evicted all the tenants on the 25th floor of 30 Roc kefeller Plaza, which was the floor above the UK Commercial Corporation, whose pr esident was William"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Stephenson. This agency was set up after Stephenso n complained on April 14, 1941 that Standard Oil was supplying the Germans th rough Spain, and that it was acting as a hostile and dangerous agency of the ene my. A 400 page report by Stephenson listing Standard Oil and other American corporations dealings with the Germans was turned over to the FBI in 1941. J. Edg ar Hoover prudently buried it. Nelson Rockefeller, as Coordinator of Inter America n Affairs, covered up the supplying of German military forces from his So uth American subsidiaries. Listed in the Stephenson Report were Standard Oil, I.G.

Sosthenes Behn, head of ITT, had hosted a lavish conference o f German intelligence operatives at the Waldorf Astoria in 1940. The Ger man director of ITT was Baron Kurt von Schroder, of the Schroder banking family o f Cologne, London and New York, who was Hitler’s personal banker. The OSS was actually set up by four members of the British Chief of Staff: Lord Louis Mountbatten (formerly Battenberg), a cou sin of the King, and related to the Frankfort banking families, Rothschild and C assel; Charles Hambro, director of Special Operations Executive, and direc tor of Hambros Bank; Col.

OSS agents received advanced training for the European theater at Bletc hley Park, British espionage headquarters. This site was chosen because it was only ten miles from Woburn Abbey, where Lord Beaverbrook’s agent, Sefton Delme r, operated the British “dirty tricks” center and other propaganda activiti es.

James Paul Warburg, son of Paul (who had written the Federal Reserve Act), was Donovan’s per sonal assistant in setting up OSS. William J.

Dillon Ripley becam e head of the Smithsonian. Donovan had been chosen to head the OSS because of two decades in which he carried out secret missions for the Morgan s, the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds. When he staffed the agency with known Communists, they offered no objection. He had earlier provided unpaid legal help for members of the Communist mercenary force, the Abraham Lincoln Brig ade. Now he welcomed these veteran “anti-Fascists” into OSS. Ford write s, “In the OSS employment of pro-communists was approved at very high levels. O SS often welcomed the services of Marxist enthusiasts.”"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"When J. Edgar Hoover, eager to embarrass a rival, s ent agents to Donovan with FBI dossiers on Communist OSS employees, Donov an replied, “I know they’re Communists–that’s why I hired them.” Donov an loaded OSS with such fanatical Communists that they became a joke in Was hington. He appointed Dr. Maurice Halperin Chief Latin American Div. OSS. Ha lperin regularly altered the information which came across his desk to fit the c urrent party line. He often kept his office locked, causing other OSS employees to j oke that “Halperin must be having another cell meeting.” After the war, J. Ed gar Hoover testified before Congress about Halperin’s Communist background. Ha lperin later moved to Moscow, then to Havana. Despite the damning dossiers which J. Edgar Hoover maintained on leading Communists in the OSS, he could find no politician willing to buck FDR’s three White House assistants, Hiss, Currie and White. El eanor Roosevelt had been one of the most frenetic activists on behalf of the Lin coln Brigade. Joe Lash gave her a small bronze of a Communist soldier, which she kept on her desk for the rest of her life. Donovan even appointed Irving Goff head of OSS in Italy after the Salerno landing. Goff had been commander of the Li ncoln Brigade, and was later chairman of the Communist Party in Louisiana and Ne w York. The Spanish Civil War had created an alliance betwe en American “intellectuals” and the Communists. In “Passionate Years”, Peter Wyden reports that Archivist Victor A. Berch, of Brandeis Univers ity, said 40% of the Lincoln Brigade were Jewish. Oddly enough, the “Fascists”, the Falange, was led by two marranos, General Franco and his financial backer, Juan March. March paid for Franco’s return to Spain with a $2 million credit a t Kleinwort’s of London. In July, 1936, March placed $82 million of securities in Nat ionalist accounts. He deposited $1.5 billion in gold at the Bank of Italy, 121.5 me tric tons greater than the gold reserve of most nations. The Communists stole the Spanish gold reserve and s hipped it to Russia.

The Lincoln volunteers surrendered their passports to NKVD officers when they arrived in Spain. These passports were then r outinely used in Communist espionage. The murderer of Trotsky was arrested in Mexico with a Canadian passport issued to Tony Babich, who was killed in t he Civil War. Gouzenko later exposed a Communist agent in Los Angeles using the passport of Ignacy Witczak. Witnesses saw stacks of these Lincoln passports sta cked in the Lubianka prison, waiting to be used. Ernest Hemingway wrote that “The Spanish Civil War was the happiest time of our lives.” He modelled his hero in “For Whom t he Bell Tolls” on Robert Merriman, a Moscow agent who was receiving a $900 a year fellowship from the University of California. Hemingway wrote and prod uced a film, “The Spanish Earth” to raise money for the Communists, aided by Archibald Macleish, Dashiell Hammett and Lillian Hellmann. Hemingway put up $27 50 for the film, and donated all his royalties. He toured Hollywood to raise funds for the Communists, an effort reciprocated when they named his book “Fo r Whom the Bell Tolls” a book-of-the-Month Club selection and a multi-millio n dollar Hollywood production. This was how one achieved “artistic su ccess” in the 1940’s. The English contingent fighting in Spain for the Co mmunists included Virginia Woolf’s nephew, Julian Bell, who was kille d, and Eric Blair, later known as George Orwell. He was in the front line for 112 da ys before being wounded. He later wrote “1984” a propaganda coup for the World Order which claimed no one would be able to withstand their power. He conclud ed “1984” with the observation that the future would be marked by a ja ckboot being stamped into the human face forever. Journalists to a man rallied to the Communist cause . A.M.

There I learned that men could be brothers. Today, wherever in thi s world I meet a man or woman who fought for Spanish liberty I meet a kindr ed soul. Nothing will ever break that bond. We left our hearts there.” Despi te his despair, Matthews was able to relive the glory of Spanish years when he promot ed Castro and a band of six guerillas into the dictatorship of Cuba, through a frenetic propaganda barrage in the New York Times . Kim Philby, later active with the OSS and CIA as Br itish Liaison also was prominent in the Spanish Civil War. Son of the fam ed Arabist, Sir Harold Philby, he joined the Cambridge Socialist Society in 1929. He worked for the British Treasury 1932-33 and was recruited by the communist party. In 1934, in Vienna, he married Litzi Friedmann, a communist agent. Wit ness at the marriage was Teddy Kollek, later a fundraiser for the Israeli te rrorists, now Mayor of Tel Aviv. Working as a Soviet mole, Philby was financed by th e Schroder Bank in 1934 to publish a pro-Hitler magazine for the Anglo-Germ an Fellowship. The Times then sent him to Spain to cover the Civil War. He took as his mistress the divorced wife of Sir Anthony Lindsay-Hogg, Frances Doble, a Falangist sympathizer whose Salamanca palace became his Spanish headquarters. The daughter of a Canadian banker, Doble lavishly entertained the Falangist le aders. Philby Frequently met General Franco there. Philby was recruited for the British SIS in 1940. In 1942, he helped Norman Holmes Pearson, a Yale professor who specialized in the work of Ezra Pound, to set up the London office of OSS with Charles Hambro chief of SOE. In 1949, Philby was sent to Washington as SIS liaison office r with the CIA and FBI. J. Edgar Hoover frequently lunched at Harvey’s Restaur ant with Philby and James Angleton of the CIA. While CIA station chief in Ro me, Angleton worked closely with the Zionist terrorists Teddy Kollek and Jacob Meridor, and later became chief of the Israeli desk at the CIA, helping Philby to s et up the lavishly funded international Mossad espionage operation, all paid for by American taxpayers.

Philby was quoted as saying, “Foreign ag encies spying on the U.S. Government know exactly what one person in the CIA wants them to know, no more and no less.” Philby was finally exposed by a defector, Michael Goleniewski. On Jan. 23, 1963, Philby left Beirut and defected t o Moscow, where he became a Lt. Gen. in the KGB. On June 10, 1984, Tad Szulc w rote in the Washington Post that Philby was never a Soviet agent, according to CIA memoranda introduced in a lawsuit, but that he was a triple agent.

Gen. Biddle to alert the Dept. of jus tice to this operation; because of the coming election, Roosevelt prudently withdrew h is support for the plan. Because of their co-operation with the NKVD and the prominent Communists in OSS, General Douglas MacArthur refuse d to allow any OSS agent in his theater of operations in the Pacific. Donov an went to MacArthur’s headquarters on April 2, 1944 and made a personal a ppeal to him, but was rebuffed.

Churchill persuaded Roosevelt to pos tpone the Wedemeyer plan for another year, while the Churchill plan was put into action in North Africa in Nov. 1942. Wedemeyer’s plan was vindicated in 1946 by G en. Franz Halder, Chief of Staff of the German Army, who said the Wedemeyer cr oss-Channel invasion would have been a decisive and timely blow which would ha ve shortened the war by at least a year. However, ending the war in 1943 woul d have cost the munitions manufacturers many billions in profits. Ezra Pound broadcast on July 17, 1943. “I reckon my last talk was the most courageous I ha ve ever given. I was playing with fire. I was openly talking about how the war may be prolonged, by fellows who were scared that the war might stop. I mean th ey’re scared right out of their little gray panties, for fear economic equity might set in as soon as guns stop shooting or shortly thereafter. The stage scenery fell with a flop, simultaneously with some anti-Axis successes.” What was Pound talking about ? Stage scenery – wha t a cynical way to describe a world conflagration in which one hundred million people were dying. Pound exposed the charade. Early in the war, a Bri tish Secret Service operation, Operation Ultra, had obtained the German coding mac hine. They were able to read every secret order from Hitler and the German General Staff. It was like shooting fish in a barrel. F.W. Winterbotham, chie f of Air Intelligence, SIS, wrote about his operation of Ultra, “The Ultra Secret”. He says, “On Aug. 2 (1944) which I remember, covered two whole sheets of my Ul tra paper, Hitler told Kluge not to pay any attention to the American breakout. He then outlined his master plan for handling the entire invasion.”"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Had Hitler had access to all secret communications of the Allies, he would have had an unbeatable advantage. The Allies liste ned to all of his orders, and reacted accordingly. Early in the war, Ultra infor med them that the Germans were planning a massive bombing raid on Coventry. If th ey evacuated the city, it would show the Germans they were listening to their plans . Churchill ordered the British to do nothing. The Germans bombed Coventry, killin g thousands of women and children. The Ultra secret was protected at the co st of many British lives. The British also had a double agent, Baron Wilhelm de Ropp, who was Hitler’s personal confidante on British policy. De Ropp had lived in England since 1910. He married an English wife, but maintained a n apartment on the Kurfurstendamm, as a journalist moving between Germ any and England. His closest friend in England was F.W. Winterbotham, ch ief of Air Intelligence. In Feb. 1939, de Ropp took Winterbotham to Germany, wh ere he conferred with Hitler, Rudolf Hess, and von Milch, head of the Ger man Air Force. Winterbotham writes, “By 1934, I had obtained personal contact w ith the Head of State, Hitler, and with Alfred Rosenberg, the official Nationalist Party Philosopher and Foreign Affairs expert, and Rudolf Hess, Hitler’s deputy. From my personal meetings with Hitler I learned about his basic belief that the on ly hope for an ordered world was that it should be ruled by three superior powers, t he British Empire, the Greater Americas, and the new Greater Reich. I felt that h is desperate desire for peace was no bluff. (At Dunkirk) Hitler told his General Sta ff exactly what he had told me in 1939; it was necessary that the great civilization Britain had brought to the world should continue to exist and that all he wanted fro m Britain was that she should acknowledge Germany’s position on the Continent.” Hitler failed to comprehend the depravity of the be hind the scenes figures of the World Order who had gained control of the Briti sh Empire with the South Africa wealth they had won in the Boer War.

Schacht, Hitler’s Finance Minister, named his grand son Norman because of the friendship. Paul Einzig, in “Appeasement Before, D uring and After the war”, says “On May 29, 1933, Mr. F.C. Tiarks of the British Ba nking Delegation met with Dr. Schacht, and found Dr. Schact’s attitude wholly sat isfactory.” Mr. Tiarks was a longtime partner of J.

In 19 65, the then Duke of Windsor remarked, “I never thought Hitler was such a bad ch ap.” The story behind Edward’s sudden abdication was that his advisers re alized he would not sign the papers for mobilisation against Germany.

The Dulles Bros. were there as legal representatives of Kuhn, Loeb Co., which had extended large short-term credits to Germany, and needed a guarantee of repayment. Allen Dulles was later esconced in Switzerland by the OSS during World War II. Still later, he be came Director of the CIA. He had been a director of J. Henry Schroder Co. for ma ny years. On June 11, 1934, Lord Norman and Schacht met secre tly at Badenweiler in the Black Forest, and again in Oct. 1934, to guaran tee loans to National Socialist Germany. The J.H.

He wrote indignantly, “The Astors and others clustered around Chamberlain were a set of appeasers who saw Hitler’s regime and their collaboration with it as necessary to maintain the social order they preferred.” The Cockburns are too self-limited to understand th at the “appeasers” collaborated with Hitler only to obtain the world w ar which was essential to their world program. Hitler was duped into going into th e Rhineland, duped into going into Czechoslovakia, and duped into attaching Polan d. The advertised belief is that he was amazed at the weakness of the opposition to these moves; in fact, he had been promised there would be no opposition, until h e went into Poland and discovered he had been duped. Once Hitler had served his purpose, these same bank ers plotted to assassinate him.

Admiral Canaris, in charge of the Abwehr, Hitler’s intelligence service s had made contact with the British Secret Service in London as soon as he assu med that post, through Frankfurt lawyer Fabian von Schlabrendorff, a key m ember of the plot, aided by Count Helmut von Moltke, a member of the German Bar and also a member of the Inner Temple of London.

In 1943, he was promoted to Major General, and rece ived pay for that grade. In 1943, OSS had a $35 million budget, with 1651 emplo yees, which increased tenfold the following year to 16,000. By the end of the wa r, there were 30,000 agents and sub-agents, many of whom were involved in looting, blackmail, and other money- making schemes. Airplanes were often commandeered for mysterious flights to haul huge sums in gold, diamonds, paintings and oth er treasure. From the outset, the OSS had been dealing in large sums in gold. In the spring of 1942, $5 million in gold coins was sent to North Africa to finance s ecret operations. After the North African invasion, certain bankers who had bee n holding francs worth 100 million were suddenly worth 500 million. Large sca le currency transactions were handled for the OSS by an underworld figure named L emaigre-Dubreuil, who was shot by unknown gunmen at his Casablanca home.

The OSS secret files later turned up in the hands of Propaganda Due, P-II, a s ecret Masonic organization which included many prominent figures in Italy.

The Washington Post of Dec. 8, 1984 verified this with an obituary of Don Harris, relating that he came to Washington in 1950 as an economist with the Brookings Institution, then moved to the CIA as chief of the Far East and the West Europe staffs for three years.

Harris Smith state s that Ho Chi Minh had made contact with OSS Col. Paul Helliwell at Kunmin g in World War II and was recruited as an agent. Ho’s reports soon received top priority at OSS Headquarters in Washington, and were placed directly on Gen. Don ovan’s desk. Helliwell, who later became consul for the Thai government in Miam i, and Major Austin Glass, a Socony Oil official, sent arms to Ho for his revolu tionary struggle. Another early Ho supporter from OSS was Lt. Tibaut de Saint Phall e, nephew of a prominent Paris banker. Journalist Robert Shaplen was later told that an of ficial of Chase Manhattan Bank was parachuted into Ho’s remote headquarters, where he found the guerilla leader dying of malaria and dysentery. With only a few hours to live, he was saved when an OSS medic Paul Hoagland, was flown in. He saved Ho’s life by administering the new sulfa drugs and quinine. He later served at CIA headquarters until the 1970’s, where he was always known as “the man who saved Ho’s life”. After Ho was out of danger, a special OSS contingent, the Deer Team, was sent to Ho’s headquarters in Nov. 1945. The me mbers of this team were unanimous in their denunciation of the French “impe rialists”, the colonial government. They boasted that it had been decided at the highest levels in Washington that the French had to go. A prominent member of this team was Capt. Nicholas Deak, a Hungarian, now president of Deak Pereira. He has controlling interests in Swiss and Austrian banks, and operates currency exchanges in the U.S. Canada and the Far East. The French were dismayed to learn that their “Ameri can allies” were training and arming Ho’s Viet Minh forces.

In Oct. 1945, the OSS sponsored the “Vietnam Friendship Association” headed by OSS Lt. Col. Carleton H. Swi ft. The OSS armed Ho Chi Minh’s forces with the latest weapons, and gave int ensive training in infiltration and demolition to 200 selected men of General Giap’s Ar my. It was these men who later led the attacks against American troops in th e Vietnam War. The OSS sponsorship of the Viet Min and other terrorist gro ups around the world led Robert Welch to charge that “The OSS has thrown the weight of American supplies, arms, money and prestige behind the Commu nist terrorist organizations of Europe and Asia.” The Deer team claimed that Ho was a great statesman whose nationalism transcended his Communist loyalties. To supervise the developing political situation in southeast Asia, Donovan was appointed Ambassador to Thailand by Secretary o f State John Foster Dulles on Aug. 12, 1953. Donovan’s assistant was William J. van den Heuvel. After his return to the U.S. Donovan had a stroke in 1956. H e kept to his apartment in Sutton Place and rarely went to his law office. In 1957, another stroke left his brain atrophied. He lingered for several years, finally going to Walter Reed Hospital, where he died in Feb. 1959.

Alfred McCoy points out that during World War II, Lucky Luciano and Meyer Lansky secret ly worked for the OSS. Through their influence, the OSS became deeply invo lved in dope running. After the war, Lansky moved the headquarters of the dope traffic to Miami, where Paul Helliwell, OSS chief of special operations in Asia, was his front man. Helliwell also operated a CIA front in Miami called Sea Supply, In c.; one of his agents was Howard Hunt. Helliwell later served as paymaster f or CIA sponsorship of the Bay of Pigs operation. He opened secret accounts for A merican mobsters in Miami banks, working closely with Sandro Trafficante and Louis Chesler. Chesler handled Meyer Lansky’s real estate investments. The involvement of the Mob in dope running goes bac k to well before the murder of Arnold Rothstein. Although Rothstein was widely known as a gambler, this was a cover for his rise to eminence as Mr. Bi g of the U.S. drug trade. After he was shot in 1928, Louis Lepke, head of Murder Inc., confiscated over $5 million worth of heroin from Rothstein’s hotel room. Former OSS Col. Paul Helliwell became head of the p restigious Miami law firm, Helliwell, Melrose and DeWolf.

Miami Natl Bank, which is now owned by Citibank was known for many years to be controlled by Meyer Lansky. The bank f inanced the Outrigger Club, which became a meeting place for Santos Trafficante Jr., Philadelphia mobster and members of the Gambino family. Chase Natl Bank los t $20 million in this operation, but chose not to make any complaint abou t it. Citibank was also deeply involved with City Natl Bank of Miami, whose direct or Max Orovitz was a longtime associate of Meyer Lansky. The president of City Natl, Donald Beazley, had previously headed Australia’s Nugan Hand Bank, a CIA drug operation. Other directors of City Natl included Polly de Hirsch Mey er, Robert M. Marlin, who operated Marlin Capital Corp. and Viking General Co rp.; among stockholders of American Capital are Samuel Hallock DuPont Jr., and Paul Sternberg. Sternberg is also on the board of City Natl. While Marlin contro lled City Natl Bank, it picked up the mortgage on the Miami Cricket Club, which was o wned by Alvin Malnik, widely reputed to be Lansky’s heir apparent. Anoth er director of City Natl was Sam Cohen, a Lansky associate who controlled Miami Natl Bank. In 1973, a bank was established in Australia under the name of Nugan Hand.

General Eric Cocke Jr., a Washington public relations officer, was Nugan Hand ’s Washington representative. From the outset, the bank was acti vely engaged in the drug trade. Lernoux says the bank controlled the $100 million “ Mr. Asia” heroin syndicate which arranged a number of contract murders. Hand boasted that Nugan Hand Bank was paymaster for (:IA operations anywhere in the world. In Saudi Arabia, Nugan Hand Bank handled the huge outlays of Bechtel Corp. in its billion dollar operations. Bechtel employees were told they must bank with Nugan Hard. The Manila office of Nugan Hand was run by Lt. Gen. Ler oy J. Manor, who had been Chief of Staff of U.S. forces in Asia. The CIA sta tion chief at Bangkok, Red Jansen represented Nugan Hand in Thailand. We may recall that Gen. Donovan, founder of the OSS, had gone to Thailand in 1953 as U.S. Am bassador. Nugan Hand’s important contacts with government officials, perha ps greased with handouts from its huge drug operations, shielded it from investig ation. In 1978, despite repeated complaints about Nugan Hand’s international drug op erations, the Australian Federal Bureau of Narcotics refused to investigate. When increasing public pressure was brought to bear on the Bureau to inves tigate Nugan Hand Bank, the Bureau disbanded in 1979 ! It was controlled by th e Australian Secret Intelligence organization, which in turn was dominated by the CI A.

The World Order saw to it that funds w ere given only to those politicians who would carry out their program.

An Australian Royal Commission proved that the bank regularly transferred funds from Sydney to sou theast Asia as payment for heroin shipments to the U.S. West Coast via Austra lia.

However, this is merely a staging area for the world’s drug trade. Review of the News in 1970 indentified Red China as the world’s large st producer of opium, its usual source of hard currency from non-communist na tions. The refined opium reaches the “free world”, that is “the cash world”, through Canton and Hong Kong. It also includes heroin, which had been synt hesized from opium in 1898 by the Bayer Co., and became one of their most importa nt products. Red China’s mutterings about taking over Hong Kong when the present lease expires in 1997 allows insiders of the World Order opportunity to increase their fortunes in the volatile Hong Kong real estat e market. Red China has to allow the British to operate in this trading area to assu re the supply of hard currency from the drug trade. When the British took over th is trading area in 1843, they maintained control of the local population through the Triads, the Assassins, as the Hong Society was known, also called the Honorable S ociety, and the Society of Heaven, Earth and Man. Dan E. Mayers wrote in Fortune , Aug.6, 1984, “British colonial rule in Hong Kong is not democracy. Brita in rules by decree in all matters of importance. Hong Kong Chinese don’t have democr atic rights.” Opium began as a cash crop in the poppy-fields of A sia Minor, particularly in Turkey, where it is still an important crop toda y. In 1516, opium was the official monopoly of the Great Mogul in Kuch Behar. When op ium reached China, about 1729, Emperor Yung Chen prohibited its use. In 175 7, with Clive’s great victory at Plassy, the East India Co. took over the opium mono poly as part of its spoils from the Indian Moguls. When the British promoted the u se of East India’s opium in China, as payment for raw materials needed by their Industrial Revolution (they had been paying in silver), the Emperor Tao Kwang r epeatedly warned them to stop selling opium in his country. When these warn ings were ignored, the Emperor burned 20,291 chests of opium in 1830, a ho ard valued at 2 million pounds. This precipitated the British Opium Wars o f 1839-42 and 1856-60."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Because the Communists were financed by the interna tional bankers, the sale and use of drugs have always played an important ro le in the forward march of Communist hegemony.

In 1983, Red China had 9 million acres of poppies under cultivation. The Peiping Go vernment has 101 narcotics factories in operation, which refine from 50% to 70 % of the world’s drugs. In 1977, Edward Jay Epstein revealed the true story behind Watergate. Nixon’s Domestic Council was a group of aggressive young men trying to outmaneuver each other with new programs. Gordon L iddy, trying to break into this circle, conceived an ambitious program called operation Intercept. It was not a surveillance program, but was designed to “intercep t” the flow of drugs into the U.S. Nixon in his 1968 campaign had promised to “mo ve against the source of drugs”. A special Presidential Task Force Relating to Narcotics, Marijuana and Dangerous Drugs had been formed, but had taken no a ction. Liddy got Egil Krogh, Nixon’s Presidential Deputy for Law Enforcem ent, to introduce the program at a meeting of the Domestic Council. Rich ard Helms director of the CIA, was among those present. The plan was officia lly approved by Erlichman in July, 1970 as a major operation against the heroin traffic. There still was no real program, merely a public relations ploy, but, senio r staff people at CIA panicked. They feared that their vast Asia operations, funded by their drug operations, could be wiped out. Liddy, meeting with State and CIA of ficials, says, “I pressed CIA on the problems of the Golden Triangle of Burma; Rich ard Helms replied ‘Any move in that area would be impractical’.” Liddy had set up ODESSA, Organisation Der Emerlinge n Schutz Staffel Angehorigen, which was ready to begin operations.

In 1 964, the number of U.S. addicts had dropped to 48,000 down to 60,000 in 195 0. Then 15% of all American soldiers in Vietnam returned home as addicts. The drug monopoly was back in business.

After the collapse of the Nugan Hand Bank and the d isappearance of its principals, the CIA used the 17 international offic es of a Honolulu investment firm, Bishop, Baldwin, Rewald, Dillingham and Wong as its Asian network. The firm handled some $10 billion in CIA covert funds, laund ering huge sums for the Gandhi family in India, and worked closely with Mar cos’ right hand man in Manila, Enrique Zobel, one of the ten wealthiest men in the world, who handled the investment fund of the Sultan of Brunei.

On the basis of its $6.9 b illion revenues last year, the company ranked as the third largest engineering and construction concern in the U.S., after Brown & Root Inc. and the Fluor Corp. B echtel's contracts are largely in huge industrial and energy-related projects that La rry Thomas, a Bechtel spokesman, refers to as ‘mega-Projects'. At present , the company is under a 25 year contract for construction of a city for more than 3 ,000 people and an industrial complex at Jubail, Saudi Arabia, and to engineer a hydroelectric project at James Bay in Canada that would include a network of dams and earth-filled dikes large enough to substitute for 10 conventional power plan ts. Bechtel is also the country's leading builder of nuclear power plants.\" Many Bechtel projects have been characterized as hu ge boondoggles. Many nuclear power projects have either failed to come \" online\" or have been abandoned, causing billion dollar writeoffs and sha ky financial markets. Bechtel has built such problem-plagued ventures as BART (Bay Ar ea Rapid Transit System) in San Francisco, METRO, the Washington D.C. subway sy stem (the Washington Post recently noted it was already $200 million in the red and will ultimately cost $12 billion), and Jubail, called \"the biggest boond oggle in history\". Time, July 12, 1982, wrote of Jubail, \"Bechtel has spent $35 billion and plans to spend $100 billion more. Bechtel's original cont ract had been for a modest $9 billion.\" Jubail is described as lying 324 miles n ortheast of the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh, with 100 plus temperatures most of the year, a desolate area of salt flats washed by the Persian Gulf. 1600 Bechtel empl oyees live on the site in 3 bedroom ranch houses built for $300,000 each, direc ting the activities of 39,000 construction workers. Time says, \"The infant city c ould wind up being and enormously expensive ghost town, as marching dunes are expected to cover it by the year 2000.\" Christopher Reid, who worked for Bechtel, says \"Jub ail is a massive WPA project, the biggest boondoggle in history.\" He pr edicts that the sands of the Dahana Desert will shift and cover Jubail before th e end of this century.

Historically, the dunes of the Dahana Desert shift massively ever y few years. Engineers expect the Jubail area to be completely covered by the yea r 2000. Future archeologists will be puzzled by this strange ruin, not realizing that the entire project resulted from the huge oil price increases inflicted upon the Ame rican people, and pressures compelling the Saudi Arabian leaders to return much of their profit to wealthy entrepreneurs such as the Bechtel Group. The New York Times reported July 26, 1982, \"Pres. R eagan's special Middle East envoy, Philip C. Habib, is also serving as a p rivate consultant to Bechtel Group, Inc. He had been hired by George P. Shultz w hile Shultz was president of Bechtel. State Dept. spokesman Dean Fischer said Mr . Habib's retention by Bechtel did not compromise U.S. diplomatic efforts in the M iddle East. ‘It doesn't strike me as a problem any more for Habib than it would be for Weinberger or Shultz,' Mr. Fischer said. \"Who's Who shows Philip C.

Hoover Institution, Stanford, and the B ohemian Club are an interlocking power structure dominating the Washing ton political scene. On July 27, 1982, the New York Times noted further praise for Habib from the White House and State Dept. Senator Alan Cranst on and other luminaries. \"A spokesman for the Israeli lobby voiced confidence t oday in Pres. Reagan's Special Envoy to the Middle East Philip C. Habib; Thomas A .

Henderson noted that when Count Bernadotte raised support for Palestine refugees in 1948, the largest contributors were Arabian American Oil Co. $200,000 , and Bechtel International, $100,000.

Israe l respected Mr. Habib as an outstanding statesman and faithful friend of the St ate of Israel !'.\" The Times failed to get the comments of any Arabs about Mr. Habib. On July 10, 1982, Shultz a member of the Standard O il Pratts, was reported by the New York Times to have promised he would \"di vest\" himself of his Bechtel holdings by putting them in a blind trust. Bechtel is a privately held company, 40% of the stock held by the family, the rest by its ex ecutives, who sign an agreement that when they leave the firm or die, the company h as first option to repurchase their stock, which option is always exercised. The New York Times reported Jan. 18, 1979, \"Increasingly sensitive to accusations of sec retiveness, the privately held Bechtel group of companies took a new step in imple menting a policy of disclosure today when it issued for the first time something a pproaching an annual report. Since all stock is held by top executives and membe rs of the Bechtel family, this took the form of a report to the 30,000 employees a round the world rather than a report to stockholders.\" The Times commented in 1982 that \"Bechtel does not disclose its earnings\". Informed estimates are that Bechtel earned 5% net profit on its $11.6 billion revenues in 1982. Stephen D. Bech tel Sr., now in his eighties, is said to be worth $750 million. His son, Stephen Jr. now head of the firm, is said to be worth $250 million. When his father dies, the yo unger Bechtel is expected to become a billionaire. Newsweek reported Dec. 29, 1975, \"The Bechtel group of companies is hardly a household word. As a privately held corpor ation, it has operated for 77 years behind a wall of secrecy that is considered u nequally impenetrable in the"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"competitive world of heavy construction. Its revenu es are estimated at $2 billion a year, equal to General Mills or Standard Oil of Ohi o. Bechtel got that way by wheeling and dealing not only in private operations but with governments themselves. The company is building a new 34 story building on Fremont St. in San Francisco. The company, says one Federal energy off icial, is putting together a modern version of a military industrial complex mac hine, and they have an inside track on the growth market of the future. It will b e called the new General Motors before the century is out.\" Bechtel began in 1898 when a Midwestern farm boy, W arren (Dad) Bechtel, came to California to seek his fortune. He began wi th a mule team hauling dirt on small construction projects. In 1918, with war pros perity, his income increased. His first important project was building a railroad for Hutchinson Lumber Co. at Orotillo, Cal. His three sons, Warren, Steve and Ke n joined him in the growing business. In 1928, he was elected president of Asso ciated General Contractors of America, a powerful lobbying group. In 1931, Dad Be chtel became president of Six Companies, a consortium formed to build the $49 mil lion Boulder Dam. It was incorporated in Delaware in Feb. 1931 by H.J. Kaise r Sr. and Jr.; Felix Kahn of MacDonald and Kahn; Henry W. Morrison of Morrison- Knudsen; W.A. Bechtel Co.; J.F. Shea of Los Angeles, which built the Pac ific Bridge at Portland, and General Construction Co., Seattle. MacDonald and Ka hn had built the Mark Hopkins Hotel; Morrison was a trustee of Stanford and close friend of Herbert Hoover and Leland Cutler. Between 1931 and 1936, the consortium built the Bon neville Dam, the San Francisco Bay Bridge, and other projects. During th e construction of Hoover (Boulder) Dam, a steel salesman, John McCone, calle d on Bechtel. He had been a friend of Steve Bechtel at the Univ. of California in 1922. Steve was now head of the firm, due to the mysterious death of Warren Bec htel in Moscow August 29, 1933. Dad Bechtel, 61, had come to Russia to inspec t the Magnitogorsk Dam, on a 3 day tour which also included the Dnieperstroy Dam . He had been instructed by the Soviet authorities to come alone, and he left h is wife in Vienna. While staying at"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"the National Hotel in Moscow, before leaving on the tour, Dad Bechtel died suddenly of \"an overdose of medicine\". There was no autopsy. Someone in the Kremlin, perhaps Stalin, had changed his mind about allowing Bechtel to inspect the dam. Stephen Bechtel found a ready ally in the aggressiv e business acumen of John McCone. They formed a separate company, Bechte l-McCone, in the nick of time before World War II broke out. In Dec. 1940, t hey got an order of $210 million for sixty British freighters, to be built i n alliance with Admiral Vickery of Bath Iron Works. McCone and partners later made 844 million profit on Liberty ships built at their Sausalito plant. They also own ed California Shipbuilding, a Los Angeles yard which turned out 967 ships during the war, as well as Marinship, the Oregon Shipbuilding Co. They owned Joshua Hendy Cor p. an ironmonger which built the engines for Liberty ships. By Sept., 1943 , they had more than $3 billion in shipbuilding orders. The crews of Liberty ships mad e wry jokes about the propensity of these hastily flung together producti ons to break in two during high seas. Many of them were torpedoed before they could fall apart. Time noted that \"Marinship turned out 460 freighters and 90 tankers at breakneck speed.\" The partners also built the colossal Army modificat ion center at Birmingham Ala. to handle the B-29 output from Willow Run; th ey built the Alaskan Military Highway, and other projects. During this defense ac tivity, Bechtel and McCone prudently remained in the background, allowing thei r proteges, the Kaisers, to be publicized as the important figures. Fortune pointe d out that Kaiser was never more than a standin for Bechtel. Kaiser, after havi ng been snubbed by AGC, became president of Associated General Contractors after the Bechtels recommended him. At the end of World War II, Bechte l Group held 20% of Kaiser Permanente Metals, which owned Richmond Ship building, the Kaiser firm. The youngest son, Ken Bechtel, ran the Marin Shipya rd. Bechtel's rush program of building Liberty ships co nsiderably antedated Pearl Harbor. Roosevelt (Dr. Win the War) issued hi s emergency shipbuilding order in January 1941; by Sept. 27, the first Libe rty ships were being launched."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"FDR, as Asst. Sec. of the Navy in 1916, had done th e same thing, awarding Navy contracts long before we entered World War I. \"Prep aredness\". The Bechtel- McCone alliance, being short of capital, invented t he ingenious \"cost-plus\" contract arrangement. Under this generous stipulation, the g overnment guaranteed war contractors all costs of production, plus a guarant eed 10% profit. The more the contractor spent, the greater his profit. It was th e greatest boondoggle for the fortunate few since the Federal Reserve System star ted printing paper money with no backing except paper bonds. The free-flowing profits led to an inevitable intel ligence connection. John McCone became president of the Air Pollution Commit tee in 1947, and in 1948, became deputy Secretary of Defense. Ralph Casey of the General Accounting Office later testified that while holding this offi ce, McCone gave contracts to Standard Oil and Kasier, firms in which he had larg e investments. McCone went on to become Under Secretary of the Air Force 1950-51, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission 1958-60, and Director of the Cent ral Intelligence Agency 1961-65, resulting in a close connection between Be chtel and the CIA. While McCone served as chairman of the Atomic Energy Comm ission, Bechtel became the largest contractor of nuclear plants in the wor ld. Bechtel completed the world's first nuclear plant at Ara, Idaho in 1951. McCone l ater became a director of Pacific Mutual Life, Standard Oil of California, and ITT. The Bechtels were now counted among the most influe ntial wheeler-dealers in Washington. Stephen Sr. and Jr. and John McCone were key members of the small group of millionaires who regularly played go lf with President Eisenhower and Arthur Godfrey at the mecca of all lobbyists, W ashington's Burning Tree Country Club. When George Pratt Shultz became a Was hington official, he regularly played golf with Stephen Bechtel Jr. at B urning Tree, which led to his being named president of Bechtel Group.

They did manage to come up wit h $5 million, financed by"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"the Schroder-Rockefeller group. Their later success has been due principally to their connection with the international financiers. Bechtel had been rescued in its time of need by J. Henry Schroder and Avery Rockefeller. John Lowery Simpson, vice president of J. Henry Schroder, was placed on Bethtel's board as chairman of its finance commi ttee, in total charge of the company's financial arrangements. Huge government c ontracts followed this connection as naturally as night follows day. The New York Times announced the debut of Schroder- Rockefeller on July 9, 1936, with Avery Rockefeller, son of Percy, and godson of William, allied in a new holding company. Avery's grandfather was James Stillman, who built the National City Bank to a giant concern. Avery Rockef eller held 42% of the stock in Schroder-Rockefeller; Baron Bruno von Schroder of London and Baron Kurt von ScFtroder of Cologne (who was Hitler's personal ban ker) held 47%. On June 3, 1954, the New York Times announced that Stephen Bechtel, chmn of Bechtel Corp. had become partner of J.P. Mo rgan Co. In 1955, Fortune reported that as Under Secretary of State, C. Dougl as Dillon had arranged important contracts for Bechtel with the Saudi Arab ian government, culminating in the present $135 billion Jubail operation. Allen Dulles, director of the CIA, was also a direc tor of Schroder Co. The vice president of Bechtel, Saudi Arabian operations , C. Stribling Snodgrass, also ran a CIA firm called LSG Associates. Bechtel built the 1100 mile long Trans Arabia Pipeline for $100 million, the largest contract let to that time. A worldwide construction firm, with entree to many countries, c an also be a conduit for intelligence agents. In 1980, Bechtel was building apartments in Saudi Arabia, a hydropower complex in Quebec, a coal fueled power p roject in Utah, an oil refinery in Indonesia, a $500 million tourist resor t in Malaysia, a copper and gold mine in Paint, New Guinea, and a $250 million palac e for the Sultan of Brunei. It was an ideal operation for the CIA, even without th e ubiquitous Schroder connection."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Bechtel was awarded the billion dollar contract for cleaning up the situation at Three Mile Island. In 1979, about halt of its bu siness derived from nuclear power activity, despite many complaints about its faulty construction in this field. Bechtel made a $14 million settlement of complaints from Co nsumers Power Co. that the Palisades nuclear plant leaked radioactive water in to the steam generating system. At Bechtel's Midland, Mich. nuclear power station, the reinforcing bar joints were found to be defective. Bechtel settled out of court with Portland General Electric, which had charged Bechtel with \"negligent design\" i n its Trojan nuclear power plant at Rainier, Oregan. Nevertheless, when Brown & Root was removed from construction at South Texas Nuclear Project, Bechte l took over. A commentator noted at that time, \"Bechtel is politically untouch able. So anybody who gets Bechtel on its side is assured of protection.\" In January, 1975, Fortune pointed out that Bechtel had never been in the red for a single year, because \"Its engineering project s are invariably financed by its clients.\" These clients are usually governments, a lesson which may have been learned from the Rothschilds. The Export Import Ban k frequently steps in and offers to finance the huge projects proposed by Bec htel. The American taxpayer finances many Bechtel projects through the World Ba nk and the International Monetary Fund. It could be said that every American has a stake in Bechtel. The president of Export Import Bank, William H. Draper III, resides at Palo Alto, California home address of the Hoover Institution a nd Hewlett-Packard Co., and Stanford University, the present headquarters of th e Reagan-Bechtel complex.

In 1940 he was named Presidenti al Adviser ,on Selective Service. In 1944, he was in charge of contract term ination for the War Dept. From 1945 to 1946, he was dictator of Germany's economy, chief of the economic division of the Four Power Economic Directorate, Al lied Military Government. He formulated the Draper Plan to revive German industr y. In 1947, he was military adviser to the Secretary of State at the Moscow Con ference. James V.

From 1997 to 1949, Draper directed the occupation of Jap an, as MacArthur's superior. He allowed MacArthur to be portrayed as the absolut e ruler of Japan, but Draper issued all the directives. In 1952 and 1953, Draper was U.S. representative to NATO with the rank of Ambassador. He then became ch mn of Combustion Engineering Systems Worldwide, a $3.15 billion comp any. He was also director of the George Putnam Fund of Boston which handles Harv ard's hugh endowment, Freeport Minerals, Chubb Corp. and Chase Internatio nal Investment. He later became chmn of Planned Parenthood, consultant to th e UN Fund for Population Control, and author of the Draper Plan for populati on control. Bechtel now has a fulltime Washington Lobbyist, Par ker Hart; a foundation, incorporated in 1953 with $7 million (the Bechtel F oundation has been called a \"rightwing foundation\" by Mother Jones, although it seems to have no particular loyalties). Stephen Jr. also has a foundation with; $2 million assets. Shultz is president of these foundations. Time , Oct. 4, 1954 noted that \"Stephen Bechtel went to Korea for the American-Korea Foundation. While there, he paid a c ourtesy call on Coordinator C. Tyler Wood of the Foreign Operations Administrat ion; Wood persuaded Bechtel to build three thermonuclear plants in Kore a for $34 million, the largest FOA contract ever issued in Korea.\" Even when occu pied with good works, bread cast upon the waters is returned. On April 2, 1974, the Washington Post reviewed a Mother Jones article which stated that a Bechtel representative, Yoon Sik Cho, a Korean-American with connections reaching to the Korean Presidency, had bribed Korean officials to win four separate billion dollar projects between 1978 and 1980. The Post said, \"The FBI, Justice Dept. and IRS are investigating allega tions that the Bechtel Corp., a large San Francisco conglomerate, used a paid consu ltant to bribe South Korean officials between 1978 and 1980 to obtain nuclear p ower plant construction projects in violation of the 1977 Corrupt Practices Act, sources said yesterday.\" Although the Post sent millions investigating Water gate, it was content to rely on"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Mother Jones' slender resources for this investigat ion. The Post continued, \"The magazines quoted an FBI informant as saying ‘it was common knowledge among lawyers at Bechtel that anyone who didn't keep Wein berger informed would be on the street the next day\". The article cited a sourc e close to Weinberger as saying \"Cap only wanted to know what it was safe to know.\" The article also pointed out that Shultz was the executive sponsor for internal auditing during the time in question. It said two audits were cancelled at Bech tel in 1980 ‘at the insistence of Cho; those audits would have revealed the large un documented cash advances being paid to Cho'.\" At the time of the bribery, S ecretary of State Shultz was president of Bechtel, and Secretary of Defense Wein berger was vice president and general counsel of Bechtel. In the ensuing months, the Post and the FBI have been content to ignore the matter, four billion dollar c ontracts being \"small change\" in Washington. Newsweek noted July 12, 1982 that Kenneth Davis, vice presi dent of Bechtel in charge of nuclear plant construction since 1979, had joined Reagan's administration as deputy secretary of Energy involv ing nuclear production, becoming the fifth member of Bechtel to join Reagan 's team. Most reporters would be up in arms if five executives of General Motors joined a White House team. Like most family concerns, Bechtel has a paternal a ttitude towards its employees. Fortune noted it paid 100% bonuses in good years. Newsweek quoted a former employee, March 18, 1968, \"They are all robots ther e. They tend to pigeonhole you for years and years.\" Fortune noted that Stephen Bechtel Sr. had stepped down as head of the firm in 1961 at the age of 60, turning the presidency over to Stephen Jr. \"Steve, Ken, and Jr. own one-half of the shares of the common stock, and most of the preferred.

In Nov. 1952, Bechtel proposed a 2500 mile pipeline fr om the Arctic to Paris, promising to deliver oil at 25¢ per 1000 cu ft, muc h cheaper than coal. Nothing came of this proposal, but Bechtel, after acquiring Peabody Coal Co. the nation's largest, in a consortium with Newmont Mining for $1 .2 billion Bechtel joined with Lehman Bros. Energy Transport System to build 70% o f the world's coal slurry lines. Peabody had been founded by Francis Stuyvesa nt Peabody, of the famed philanthropic family which originated the American foundation network to control the American people. Bechtel now began frenetic lobbying to build coal s lurry lines. An intensive campaign in Virginia failed in 1983, because of the countervailing power of the Norfolk & Western Railroad, 40% of whose revenues c ome from hauling coal. The legislators were bemused by the amount of money spe nt on the coal slurry bill, but never knew it was a Bechtel lobbying operation. Ste ven D. White, president of Bechtel Investments, said in a letter to Forbes, Ap ril 9, 1984, \"Bechtel remains strongly committed to the concept of coal slurry pi pelines and in particular to the ETSI coal slurry pipeline.\" In 1982, Bechtel offer ed to build a coal slurry line in Russia, but perhaps because of its well known CIA c onnection, the offer was ignored. The UPI reported from Houston Aug. 2, 1984 that a $3 billion proposal for a slurry line from Wyoming to the Gulf Coast ha d been defeated.

CHAPTER SEVEN The Foundations The World Order controls the citizens of the United States through the tax exempt foundations. These foundations create a nd implement government policy through their staff members in ke y positions in the"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"executive, legislative and judiciary departments. The foundations create educational policy through their staff members in k ey positions at every level of the educational system. The foundations control religious doctrine through their staff members in key positions in the leading religious denominations. “Foundation” is a misleading term; Webster calls it an endowment, but a foundation is really a trust, which Roget states is a “syndicate”. If, instead of Rockefeller Foundation, we were to say Rockefeller Syndicate, we would be much closer to the truth. Alpheus T. Mason, in his biography of justice Brandeis, quotes Brandeis as pointing out that “Soc ialism has been developed largely by the power of individual trusts.” What w e have then, are criminal syndicates masquerading as philanthropic enterprise s while they inflict Socialist world slavery on nations and peoples for the benefit of the World Order. Norman Dodd, director of research for the Reece Com mittee in its attempt to investigate tax exempt foundations, was asked by Congressman B. Carroll Reece in January, 1954, “Do you accept the premise that the United States is the victim of a conspiracy ?” “Yes,” sai d Dodd. “Then,” said Congressman Reece, “you must conduct the investigat ion on that basis.” B.E. Hutchinson, chairman of Chrysler Corp., although ap proving the goals of the investigation, warned Dodd, “If you proceed as you have outlined, you will be killed.” Dodd stated, “The foundation world is a coordinated , well-directed system, the purpose of which is to ensure that the wealth of our country shall be used to divorce it from the ideas which brought it into being. The foundations are the biggest single influence in col lectivism.” The 1975 Report of the Rockefeller Foundation showe d a $100,000 grant to the Institute for World Order, operated by Prof. Saul Mendlovitz, who states in the Institute publication Transition , Oct. 1974,"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"“I am arguing for a new governance or alternative i nstitutions to those now responsible for global concert; people w ill be demanding a central guidance system; it means a go vernance is about to come into being in which the policy elites in various nation states who have the authority and capacity t o make decisions – will no longer have that as their prero gative. There will be a governance that will say – you can’t buil d an army anymore. You must give a certain amount of your ec onomic income to other areas of the world.” In short, a World Order – no national armies; no p rivate incomes; no individual freedom. Ironically, all this is being financed by those who created wealth by the exercise of individual freedom in the United States. Mendlovitz does not use the word “government”, whic h might imply a government by the consent of the people, as in the United States. He uses “governance”, the imperial form, meaning a dictator ial decree. Every act of the foundation-syndicates, and of their masters in the World Order, is intended to implement a ruthless type of Oriental d espotism. As is traditional in this type of despotism, the most efficient palac e servants are eunuchs. Eunuchs work for little or no pay, because they do not have the expense of rearing families. In the foundation world, we find the eunuch as the predominant type of official. The eunuchs move in and out of the foundations into prominent posts in government, edu cation and religion. Although they may marry and have children, pyscholo gically they remain eunuchs, those who have forsworn their manhood to b ecome palace servants of the World Order. Columnist Jeffrey Hart recentl y commented on this type, referring to Mondale’s selection of Geraldine Ferraro as his vice presidential nominee, “Mondale should have chosen a man, in order to balance the ticket.”"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"We well may ask, if the World Order is in control, why do we need an “Institute for World Order” Why do we need the foun dations as Gauleiters of the Order’s control ? The answer is that the World Order rules because it conceals its power; it denies that it exists. Alt hough its power is obvious everywhere, in the government, in education, in the religious orders, in the wars and revolutions and famines which are so metic ulously planned and executed, the World Order, like the Mafia, refuses to acknowledge its own existence. Its subsidiaries come and go, but the O rder remains constant. When too many people discover the Council on Foreig n Relations, power is moved into the Bilderbergers, or the Trilateral Com mission. The Order’s control remains constant. The New York Times noted April 29, 1984 that 1400 officials were attending the annual meeting of the Council on Foun dations. There were 21,697 foundations in the U.S., which in 1983 distr ibuted $3.4 billion in grants. These grants are dispensed only to those w ho implement the program of the World Order, and whose goal is world slavery . The international banking families, whose origins g o back to the Middle Ages, set up the principal American foundations to protect the wealth they had amassed in their dealings in slaves, drugs and gold, and to perpetuate that wealth through means which can only be described as “imperial decrees”, government charters, in order to neutralize all pot ential rivals or opposition by controlling them and directing or misdirecting thei r opposition. None of the charters of the foundations indicate th eir real purpose. They are replete with such phrases as “the well-bei ng of mankind” “the elimination of poverty”, the “elimination of diseas e, “the promotion of world brotherhood”. Compassion, caring, charity, these a re the watchwords of the foundations.

Many eunuchs who became a liability to the World Or der have been eliminated without mercy. When Hiss, White and oth ers faced Congressional investigation, many of their acquaintances became c asualties. A lawyer named Marvin Smith, a close friend of Hiss, fell out of a window. Laurence Duggan, an intimate of both Hiss and White, was slated to t estify when he fell out of a twelfth story window. Duggan was an official of th e Institute of International Education, of which his father was founder and pres ident, but these family ties offered him no protection. In his haste to ge t to the window, he tore off one shoe, and left his office in a shambles as he f ought his way across it. The verdict was “suicide”. The Canadian diplomat, Herb ert Norman, and the Harvard Professor F.O. Matthiesen, also went out th e window before they could be made to testify about their associations. The phenomena became so common that it gave rise to a new term “defenestrat ion”, meaning the avoidance of testimony, and a suitable warning to o thers who might think of talking. We have read ad nauseam about men of great wealth who, after careers of astounding ruthlessness while amassing their for tunes, suddenly underwent a profound conversion, like Paul, and became men of goodwill. It is true that the “benefactions” of the Carnegies and the Rockefe llers are the most potent influences in American life today. They collect ever higher taxes, increase the contro l of government over every aspect of human life, and plan more wars and revolutions to further their goals. From the outset, American foundations have exhibited a twofold image – in front is the tireless do-gooder who balk s at nothing if it serves a good cause. Behind him are the evil conspirators w ho are intent on preserving and increasing their wealth and power. The foundation in its present form, originated in the concept of a Boston family, the Peabodys. Henry James in his novel “The Bostonians”, ridicule d a family friend,"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Elizabeth Peabody, for her fifty years of relentles s humanitarian zeal, portraying her as the legendary Miss Birdseye. Geo rge Peabody, after slave trading operations in Washington and Baltimore, mov ed to London, where he was set up as a front by the Rothschild family. He amassed a fortune by buying up depressed stock in American panics, and c hose a Boston trader, Junius Morgan, to carry on his business. In 1865, Peabody set up the first large-scale American foundation, the Peabody Educat ional Fund, endowing it with $1 million in government bonds. By 1867, this had grown to $2 million; by 1869, $3.6 million. Ostensibly set up to educat e Southern Negroes after the Civil War, it was a key operation in the carpet bagger strategy to gain control of Southern lands and to control their stat e governments. These states had to borrow heavily from Wall Street banke rs to rebuild their services, and they remained deeply in debt for the next centu ry. Because of its international connections, the Peabo dy Fund attracted a stellar board of directors. Gen. Ulysses Grant ser ved on its board for eighteen years; Grover Cleveland served fourteen y ears; McKinley two years; Theodore Roosevelt thirteen years. J.P. Morgan ser ved on the board for 28 vears and never missed a meeting. His partner, Ant hony Drexel, served 12 years. A fund with similar goals was the John F. S later Fund for the Education of Freedmen, established by John F. Slate r (1815-1884) a wealthy Northern textile manufacturer. Set up with $1 mill ion, by 1882, it had grown to $4 million. The three original trustees were Pr esident Rutherford B. Haves, Daniel Coit Gilman, and Morris K. Jesup, treasurer. When John D. Rockefeller discovered that the founda tions offered the road to world power, the Peabody Fund proved to be his model. He and his “Director of Charity”, Fredrick T. Gates, set up th e Southern Educational Board, which merged with the Peabody and Slater Fun ds. They later set up the General Education Board which absorbed its thre e predecessors. Its charter stated that its purpose was “the promotion of education within the USA without distinctions of race, creed or sex”. I ts goals were racial"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"amalgamation and the abolition of distinctions betw een the sexes. Its incorporators included its first president, William H. Baldwin Jr., pres. Long Island Railroad, formerly with Union Pacific, the H arriman-Schiff operation; Frederick T. Gates, Rockefeller’s righthand man; D aniel Coit Gilman, vice pres. Peabody Fund and the Slater Fund, president U niv. of California 1872- 75, president John Hopkins Univ. 1875-1901, and fir st president of the Carnegie Institute. Gilman was an original incorpo rator of the Russell Sage Foundation and the Carnegie Institute. The fact th at one man was an incorporator of the three most influential foundati ons in America shows how centralized the control of these supposedly autonom ous foundations has always been by a few ruthless individuals. Gilman is usually listed as a charter member of the World Order, because he, together wit h Andrew Dickson White and Timothy Dwight, set up the Russell Trust at Yale in 1856, to finance the Skull and Bones organization, whose mem bers are the leading front men in America. W. Averell Harriman, Vice Pr esident George Bush, and propagandist William Buckley of the National Review are typical members. Norman Dodd, also a Yale man, said, “It was well-kn own on campus that if you were tapped for Bones you would never have to w orry about success in later life.” Of the three founders of this order, Dwight became president of Yale; White, son of a railroad millionaire, was said by t he New York Times to have inherited enough money to make him free from care f or life; he became the first president of Cornell University, and gave the institution $300,000 to set up its School of Government; he became the first p resident of the American Historical Assn, and was U.S. Ambassador to Russia 1892-94, and Ambassador to Germany 1897-1902. His final legacy was to advise Herbert Hoover to set up the Hoover Institution. However, i t is with the third founder, Daniel Coit Gilman, with whom we are most concerned. Gilman trained John Dewey in collectivist theories of educ ation at Johns Hopkins University. Dewey went on to head the University o f Chicago School of"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Education, and later Teachers College at Columbia U niversity, two of the leading Fabian Socialist schools in the world. Gil man, through his protege, Dewey, has dominated American education throughout the twentieth century. Gilman also trained Richard Ely at the Jo hns Hopkins dept. of economics. Ely later taught Woodrow Wilson, whom h e describes as “unusual, brilliant”. Thus Gilman’s influence exte nded through Ely to Woodrow Wilson, who gave us the Federal Reserve Sys tem, the income tax, and the First World War. Although American, the three founders of this order were educated at the University of Berlin, where they were indoctrin ated in the Hegelian philosophy of determinism. This philosophy of educ ation and government teaches that everyone can be controlled and must be controlled in order to achieve predetermined goals. It is the philosophy of Oriental despotism transferred to Europe and adapted to the greater in dividuality of the European peoples, from whom most Americans are desc ended. As founder Frederick T. Gates wrote in the General Education B oard Occasional Paper No. 1: “In our dreams we have limitless resources and the people yield themselves with perfect docility to our moulding ha nds. The present educational conventions fade from our minds, and, u nhampered by tradition, we work our own good will upon a grateful and respo nsive rural folk.” The members of the World Order regard everyone as a peasant; they have only contempt for those who are too naive to s ee that they are being robbed, tricked and enslaved. Other original directors of General Education Board included Morris K. Jesup, a banker who had been treasurer of the Pe abody and Slater Funds. He was a director of Western Union, a Kuhn Loeb con trolled company, Metropolitan Trust, and Atlantic Mutual Insurance; Robert C. Ogden of John Wanamker Co., who served as president of Southern E ducational Board, Tuskegee Institute, Union Theological Seminary, and Hampton Institute; Walter Hines Page, who as Ambassador to Britain hel ped involve us in World"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"War I; Sir Roderick Jones, chief of Reuters News A gency at its historic address, 24 Old Jewry, London, relates a bit of his tory in his autobiography, “A Life in Reuters,” a luncheon given by him for Ge n. Smuts, Sir Starr Jameson, and Dr. Walter Hines Page (all three of wh om had Rothschild connections). “We dined in a private room at the Windham Club, th e one in which twenty years later the terms of the abdicatio n of King Edward VII were settled. We drifted on to the ques tion of the U.S. entering the war, for which Britain and France so patiently waited. Dr. Page then revealed to us, under seal o f secrecy, that he had received from the President that afternoon, a personal communication upon the strength of which he could a ffirm that, at last, the die was cast. Consequently, it was no t without emotion that he found himself able to assure us tha t the U.S. would be at war with the Central Powers inside a we ek from that date. The Ambassador’s assurance was correct to th e day. We dined on Friday, March 30. On April 2 President Wi lson asked Congress to declare a State of War with Germany. O n April 6, the U.S. was at war.” Can anyone fail to make a connection between the di rector of a “charity” designed to control the education of every citizen of the U.S., and its director who conspired to involve us in a world war ? Another incorporator of General Education Board was George Foster Peabody, a member of the family which had set up th e Peabody Fund. He married Katrina Trask, relict of Spencer Trask, a w ealthy stockbroker who specialized in railroad issues. Their estate, Yadd o, a magnificent upstate mansion, was left as a foundation to provide writer s and artists a place to work. The grantees, one need not add, have been un animously and relentlessly “liberal” in their philosophy and work , although they have"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"regrettably failed to produce any significant contr ibutions to American art or literature. Spencer Trask had been killed when som eone shunted a freight train onto the line carrying his sumptuous private car. George Foster Peabody promptly moved into Yaddo with Katrina, and lived ten years with her before marrying her in 1921. She died shortly thereafter, and Peabody “adopted” a lissome young divorcee, Marjorie White, when he was informed the church would not allow him to marry her. He th en appointed her sister, Elizabeth Ames, director of Yaddo, where she remain ed as virtual dictator for many years. The music room at Yaddo displays a lar ge bronze plaque which reads, “George Foster Peabody, Lover of Men”. Peab ody was appointed the first director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New Y ork in 1914, serving during the crucial years of World War I, until 1921 . He was an enthusiastic supporter of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, an d later became a director of FDR’s Warm Springs Foundation, and the Hampton I nstitute. Louise Ware writes in her biography of Peabody, “He (Peabo dy) added that the national crisis (World War I), when every man was n eeded, should insure the Negro opportunity.” Peabody was chairman of Combus tion Engineering Corp., president of Broadway Realtors, director of Mexican Lead Co., Mexican Coal & Coke, Mexican National Railways, Tez uitlan Copper Refining and Smelting, and served as treasurer of the Democr atic National Party. Despite his “capitalist” background, Peabody was al ways an avowed Socialist. Ware notes that he wrote to Norman Thomas, “I have always been most sympathetic to individual Socialist aspirations. I have particularly observed the Fabian System of England with hopeful anticipat ions.” This admirer of Fabian Socialism is the man who hel ped install the General Education Board as the guiding force behind all educational developments in the U.S. since 1910. The Springfield Republican noted, Oct. 1866,"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"“For all who know anything of the subject know very well that Peabody and his partners in London gave us no faith and no help in our struggle for national existence. They participated to the full in the common English distrust of our caus e and our success, and talked and acted for the South rather than for our nation. No individual contributed so much to flood ing our money markets with the evidences of our debt in Eur ope, and breaking down their prices and weakening financial confidence in our nationality than George Peabody & Co. and no ne made more money by the operation. All the money that Mr . Peabody is giving away so lavishly among our institutions o f learning was gained by the speculations of his house in our misf ortunes.” This editorial was also reprinted in the New York T imes Oct. 31, 1866. The writer did not know that Peabody was a front for th e Rothschilds, or that the establishment of the Peabody Fund was intended to g ive them political and financial control of the impoverished South, or tha t it would inaugurate the “Era of the Foundations” as the controlling factor in American life. John D. Rockefeller used General Education Board fu nds through Standard Oil representatives in Russia to provoke t he Russian Revolution in 1905. No wonder the Soviet masses cheer when a Roc kefeller arrives to visit them. To date, the Rockefellers have “given” more than $5 billion from stock income, meaning that Americans have had to ante up billions of dollars in taxes which would otherwise have been revenue on th is income. Congressman Wright Patman, chmn of the House Bankin g & Currency Committee, proved in 1967 Hearings that 14 Rockefel ler foundations held assets of more than $1 billion in Standard Oil stoc k. Not only did they pay no tax on this stock, but it gave them permanent contr ol over the family owned firm. Rival financiers could not buy control of St andard Oil because its stock was insulated by foundation ownership. As Patman p ointed out, the fact that"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"the Rockefellers escaped paying huge sums in taxes gave them an unsurpassed market advantage over other firms which had to pay normal rates of taxation. The agitation for increased “corporate taxation” ad ds to Rockefeller’s advantage. Patman said, “The Foundations are the b est investments the Rockefeller family could have made.” A family member, Senator Nelson Aldrich, shepherded the General Education Board charter through Congress. The Rock efeller Foundation charter proved more difficult. It was a flagrant e ffort to evade government decrees against the Standard Oil monopoly, but was finally pushed through in 1913 by Sen. Robert F. Wagner of N.Y., setting asid e $50 million in Standard Oil of New Jersey stock for “charitable work”. The Rockefeller Foundation charter was signed on May 22, 1913. Its incorporat ors were John D. Rockefeller, John D.Rockefeller Jr.; Henry Pratt J udson, of the Lyman and Pratt families, president of University of Chicago; Simon Flexner, educated at Universitv of Berlin and Univ. of Strasbourg, had s erved with Rockefeller Institute since 1903 as prof. of medicine; Starr J ameson, “personal counsel to John D. Rockefeller in his benevolences”; Jerome D . Greene, secretary of Harvard Corp. 1910-11, banker with Lee Higginson of London, 1912-18; sec. Reparations commission at Paris Peace Conference; Wickliffe Rose, prof. Peabody College, secretary Peabody Educational Fund , trustee of Slater Fund and General Education Board; and Charles W. Eliot, also of the Lyman family, married Ellen Peabody, educated in Germany, president emeritus of Harvard. An offshoot, the China Medical Board, sec ured Standard Oil the market for “oil for the lamps of China”, and gave t he family entree into the highly profitable Asiatic drug trade. The breakthr ough was obtained after they financed the rise to power of the Soong family , who created modern China. The list of officers of the Rockefeller Foundation from 1913-63 reveals a great deal about this organization. The four cha irmen of the board have"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"been John D. Rockefeller. Jr. 1917,1939, Walter D. Stewart, 1939-50, John Foster Dulles, 1950-52, and John D. Rockefeller 3rd , 1952-63. Walter D. Stewart served with Bernard Baruch on the War Industries Board in 1918, was with the Federal Reserve Board f rom 1922-25, and then joined the law firm of Case, Pomery, a Rockefeller firm. He was economic adviser to the Bank of England 1928-30, Special Adv iser to Bank for International Settlements 1931, Presidential Counci l of Economic Advisors for Eisenhower 1953-56, and later president of the Institute for Advanced Study. In this list of legal and financial posts, one is struck by the conspicuous absence of any “charitable” endeavours. John Foster Dulles, as senior partner of the law fi rm of Sullivan and Cromwell, carried on the firm’s traditional involve ment in promoting wars and revolutions. Few Americans know that Sullivan & Cromwell’s intrigues made the Panama Canal possible. A 736 page volume, “The Story of Panama, the U.S. H ouse Hearings on Panama in 1913,” offers hundreds of pages of doc umentation proving that William Nelson Cromwell, founder of the firm, and D ulles’ mentor, instigated and promoted the Panamanian Revolution for J.P. Mor gan and J & W Seligman. Morgan subsequently received $40 million in gold from the U.S. Treasury, the largest check it had ever drawn to th at time. $35 million of this sum was clear profit. President Theodore Roosevelt sued the New York World for libel for printing some of the facts abou t himself and Cromwell. The case was unanimously thrown out of court by the Supreme Court. We find in “The Roosevelt Panama Libel Case Against the N.Y. World” the following : “On Oct. 3, 1908, the Democratic National Committee was considering the advisability of making public a sta tement that William Nelson Cromwell in connection with M. Bunau -Varilla, A French speculator, had formed a syndicate at the time when it"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"was quite evident that the U.S. would take over the rights of French bondholders in the DeLesseps Canal, and that this syndicate included among others Charles P. Taft, br other of William Howard Taft, and Douglas Robinson, brother- in-law of President Theodore Roosevelt. These financiers inv ested their money because of a full knowledge of the intention of the U.S. Government to acquire the French property at a pric e of about $40 million and thus – because of the alleged infor mation from Government sources – were enabled to reap a rich pr ofit.” On Aug. 29, 1908, the Democratic National Committee issued a statement from its headquarters in Chicago identifying Cromwe ll as “William Nelson Cromwell of New York, the great Wall Street lawyer, attorney for the Panama Canal combine, Kuhn Loeb Co., the Harriman interest s, the sugar trust, the Standard Oil trust et al .” Thus the Democratic leaders identified Cromwell as the lawyer for the seven men who controlled America for the Rothschild s. The Democrats continued : “In Sept. 1904, during the absences of Secretary Taft from Washington, Mr. Cromwell, a private citizen practic ally ran the War Dept. John F. Wallace, Chief Engineer of the Panama Canal , testified before the Senate Committee on Feb. 5, 1905, ‘Cromwell appeare d to me to be a dangerous man’.” The House Hearings devoted many pages to Cromwell’s activities, well worth anyone’s reading, including damning testimony from Congressman Rainey : “ The revolutionists were in the pay of the Panama Railroad & Steamship Co., a New Jersey corporation. The repre sentative of that corporation was William Nelson Cromwell. He w as the revolutionist who promoted and made possible the re volution on the Isthmus of Panama. At that time he was a sh areholder in"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"the railroad and its general counsel in the United States. William Nelson Cromwell – the most dangerous man this count ry has produced since the days of Aaron Burr – is a profes sional revolutionist.” John Foster Dulles, chairman of the board of the Ro ckefeller Foundation, inherited the mantle of Cromwell as the most dangerous man in America. A member of the Rockefeller family throug h his marriage to Janet Pomeroy Avery, he was secretary to his uncle, Secre tary of State Robert Lansing, at the Paris Peace Conference. Thomas Lam ont, partner of J.P. Morgan, wrote of Dulles at that time, “All of us pl aced great reliance upon John Foster Dulles.” Dulles later turned up in Germany with Baron Kurt v on Schroder to guarantee Hitler the funds to take over Germany. U .S. Ambassador to Germany William Dodd writes in his Diary, Dec. 4, 1 933, “John Foster Dulles, legal Counsel for associated American banks , called this afternoon to give an account of claims being urged on behalf of bondholders against German cities and corporations, more than a billion dollars. He seemed very clever and resolute.” Ron Pruessen, in his biograp hy of Dulles, mentions Dulles’ “secret discussions with the German Cabinet Dec. 1933 and Jan. 1934 in Berlin.” Pruessen lists Dulles’ banking clients during the 1920s, “J.P. Morgan, the national City Co., Kuhn, Loeb & Co., Di llon Read, Guaranty Trust, Lee Higginson, and Brown Bros Harriman.” Du lles had a legal monopoly on Wall Street. John Foster Dulles never lost his penchant for star ting wars. How many Americans know that it was John Foster Dulles who sent a telegram from Tokyo to President Truman’s advisers, “If it a ppears that the South Koreans cannot repulse the attack, then we believe that U.S. force should be used.” Although Dulles never revealed who “we” inc luded, this telegram set off our involvement in the Korean War."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Among the presidents of the Rockefeller Foundation, we find George E.

Every American worker is regularly reminded of one Rockefeller Foundation “boon to mankind” when he receives his m utilated pay check with the “withholding tax” ripped from it. In 1943, at the height of World War II, Congress passed an “emergency” wartime tax bill, the Current Tax Payment act of 1943. Enacted on June 9, 1943, the bill became known as the Withholding Tax. The “emergency” ended some forty years ago, and in the intervening decades the bill has been and it is ill egal. It is illegal because it is not “withholding” and because it is not a tax. Sin ce it is not what it claims to be, it cannot be enforced, as it has no legal stand ing. In legal terms, the withholding tax is a garnishee. Webster defines a garnishee as a legal notice served with a writ of attachment to attach the wage s of a debtor on behalf of a"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"creditor. However, the withholding tax is not a le gal notice served with a writ of attachment, nor is it issued by any court, and i s not collectible under U.S. law. Second, the “debt”, or tax, can only be estab lished on the annual return at then end of the taxable year, as provided by law . IRS claims that the withholding tax establishes “the liability at the s ource”. However, no debt has been established at the time of collection. The withholding tax is also illegal because it was enacted into law as the result of a conspiracy by persons who concealed the ir motives and their allegiances. Beardsley Ruml, who foisted the plan on Congress, told a New Yorker reporter that the withholding tax plan origi nated at a luncheon of “intellectuals” at the luxurious Plaza Hotel. He r efused to identify any of the other conspirators. Fortune said of him, “Beardsley Rural of pay-as-you-go fame (characteriz ed by Congressman Wright Patman as protecting the first c rop of war millionaires), is beyond a doubt one of the most me ntally agile and popular men in American history. Like many oth er interesting personalities, the treasurer of Macy’s, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and eminent fiscal planner is a far from simple character. The former dean of so cial sciences at the Univ. of Chicago later worked for the Carneg ie Corp. In 1922 the Rockefellers made the 28-year old Ruml dir ector of the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial ($80 million). The Memorial had been founded for charitable aid to wom en, but Mr. Rural, arguing that the welfare of the individu al depends on the welfare of the whole society, threw the organiz ation and $25 million of the funds behind the social sciences.” Ruml’s idea of the withholding tax is suggested in his book. “Government Business and Values”, p. 179, “It is ev ident that the progress of science, technology and education will force import ant changes in our"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"personal, social and economic relationships. To me et these changes, government must change and modify the laws, rules a nd regulations under which we live.” Note that Ruml says “force” change s, by “government” decree. This is the entire foundation program, to impose by force their will on the American electorate, in a criminal syndicali st conspiracy against the wellbeing of every American. The 1971 list of trustees of the Rockefeller Founda tion shows it continues to be the ruling hierarchy of the U.S. I t includes W. Michael Blumenthal, and C. Douglas Dillon, both of whom ser ved as Secretaries of the Treasury; Robert F. Goheen, president of Princ eton; Vernon Jordan, the token black; Robert V. Roosa, and Cyrus Vance, Sec retary of State under Carter. Roosa is a founding member and secretary o f the Trilateral commission. While he was on the staff of the Feder al Reserve Bank of N.Y., Roosa trained a group known as the “Roosa Bloc”, hi s chief protege being Paul Volcker, who, as chairman of the Federal Reser ve Board of Governors, unleashed a ruinous recession in the U.S. with 20% interest rates and 25% inflation. Of course the banks profited handsomely while driving millions of Americans into bankruptcy. The New York Times reported that David Rockefeller and Roosa “suggested” to Carter that he appoint Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Roosa is a partner of Brown Bros. Harriman, director of Texaco, American Express, Owe n Corning Fiberglass, director National Bureau of Economic Research, trus tee Sloan Kettering Institute, and chairman of Brookings Institution.

Brookings born 1850, unmarried, a St. Louis merchant and head of t he Cupples Co. which revolutionized the distribution of goods from railw ay stations. In World War I, Brookings was Baruch’s assistant at the War Indu stries Board, which had dictatorial powers over American industrialists, an d Chairman of the Price Fixing Committee of WIB. An original trustee of Ca rnegie Endowment for International Peace, Brookings set up the Brookings Garduate School of Economics, which merged with the Institute of Gover nment Research and the Institute of Economics in 1927 to form the pres ent Brookings Institution. It is listed as “not a membership organization”, wh ose goal is “to set national priorities”, in short, to make government policy, w hich it does. It rode into power with Roosevelt’s New Deal, hardly a surprisin g development, since its incorporator, Frederic A. Delano, was FDR’s uncle. The present chairman, Robert V. Roosa, was preceded in that office by C. Douglas Dillon. It has always been the forum of the world’s most powerful financiers. In 1984, Brookings Institution originated a new pro gram for the government, written by a team of 10 economists head ed by Alice Rivlin, former director Congressional Budget Office. Rivli n proposed that the income tax be replaced or augmented by a consumptio n tax laid upon all consumption, bequests and gifts. In short, the tra ditionally leftwing Brookings Institution hopes to enact into law the i llegal IRS technique of “composite net worth”, laying an income tax on citi zens by estimating what they spend or consume, a “cash flow” tax as inescap able as the Rockefeller- Ruml withholding tax. Their only goal is to grind the working man into hopeless poverty through ruthless extortion by gove rnment agents. In 1978, corporations gave Brookings $95,000; in 1 984, this figure had jumped to $1.6 million.

T hus we see that the major foundations were all organized by the same sm all group of people, bankers and lawyers who function as front men for t he World Order. James T. Shotwell ably represented the goals of the World Order for more than sixty years. Born in Canada in 1874, he joined the staff of Columbia University in 1900 as a prof. of history. In 1916 he was invited by Col. House to set up a study group, the Inquiry, wi th Walter Lippmnann, to “study postwar political economic historical and le gal developments,” although we were not even in the war! This was the core of the American Commission to Negotiate Peace at Versailles which w rote the Peace Treaty. In 1917, Shotwell became personal adviser to Presid ent Woodrow Wilson. He was appointed official historian of the ACNP, an d actually wrote the social security clauses of the Versailles Treaty. He wrot e a 150-volume history of World War I, published by Columbia. He had become a close friend of Herbert Hoover during the war, and advised him on s etting up the Hoover Institution.

The most tragic victims of the World Order’s networ k of foundations and universities are the nation’s youth. Filled wi th hope and ambition, they attend colleges to prepare for careers, where their chief advisers are the foundation eunuchs. They are carefully scrutinized to see if they can be useful to the World Order, in which case they may be given grants or fellowships, but the cruel fact is that unless they are fortunat e enough to be born into a family connection with members of the World Order, or become protege of a eunuch, most doors will forever remain closed to th em. Despite their talents or ability, they will be relegated to joining the h ewers of wood and the drawers of water for the rest of their lives. At no time d uring their education will they be apprised of the fact that they are the victims o f a cruel hoax, that success in business, drama, art or literature will be denied t hem because they do not have the required connection with the World Order. The art scene is dominated by the New York art dealers, who in turn are dominated by the Museum of Modern Art, founded and controlled by the Rockefell er family. The founders were Nelson Rockefeller, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller ( wife of John D. Jr.), Blanchette Hooker, wife of John D. 3rd, and Lizzie Bliss. Such is their power that they can declare empty beer cans or piles of r ope or rocks to be Great Art, worth many thousands of dollars. They achieve a dual purpose of destroying the creative life of the people while pr omoting the work of their favorite propagandists. The new treasurer of the S mithsonian Museum, Ann Leven, was formerly treasurer of Museum of Modern A rt, also senior vice president of corporate planning at Chase Manhattan Bank. Nov. 1955 Fortune featured an article by William H. Whyte, “Where the Foundations Fall Down”, which pointed out that the foundations only grant funds to “big team” projects in institutions which are under their control. Whyte says 76% of all foundation grants a re made to these “team” projects, citing huge sums given to the Russian Res earch Center at Harvard by"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Carnegie, and Ford grants to the Center for Advance d Study in Behavioral Science at Stanford. Foundation grants are rarely given to individuals, and most can be traced to some underlying propaganda dr ive, such as the $200,000 which the Rockefeller Foundation gave to e stablish the National Bureau of Economic Research, whose “studies” effect ively dominate the world of American business today.

Because of growing Congressional outcry against the vast expenditures of the major foundations on behalf of Communist rev olutionary causes, the World Order decided to give the American people som e “anti-Communist” foundations, based in the Hoover Institution on War , Peace and Revolution. The Hoover group is generally thought to be conserv ative, but on examining their personnel and directors, we find the same old international crowd of Bolsheviks and financiers."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"The Hoover Institution was founded at Stanford Univ ersity, Palo Alto, Calif. in 1919 with a donation of $50,000 from Herb ert Hoover. He had been a member of the first graduating class at Stanford, founded with a bequest from Leland Stanford, the Southern Pacific railroad tycoon. His only son, Leland Stanford Jr. died in a hotel room in Florenc e, Italy at the age of fifteen. His grieving mother became the prey of a number of spiritualists, one of whom persuaded her to start a spiritualist unive rsity, founded on such mystical Eastern teachings, as “The balance between night and day is the balance of the world”, and “The mainspring of the m ovement of the world”. “Life and death is the great secret of immortality. ” Because of the difficulty of organizing these doctr ines into a coherent academic curriculum, Mrs. Stanford was dissuaded fr om the idea of a “spiritualist” university, and the present Stanford University then came into being. Reputedly “conservative”, it has in fact be en dominated by Harvard Liberals for many years. Herbert Hoover founded the Hoover Institution at th e suggestion of three men, Andrew Dickson White, Daniel Coit Gilman , and Ray Lyman Wilbur, president of Stanford. Newsweek June 7, 19 59 noted that Hoover said, “In 1915 while head of the Committee on Relie f in Belgium, I happened to read some remarks by President Andrew White of C ornell made at a conference on the disappearance of contemporaneous documents and fugitive literature.” Hoover says he resolved to institute a search of Europe after the war to obtain documents and preserve them in an aca demic setting. Gilman and Wilbur aided him in planning this program. Bot h White and Gilman were original incorporators of the Russell Trust, which has dominated American education for a century. Wilbur requested that Hoo ver install this collection at Stanford. Wilbur served as director of the Rock efeller Foundation 1923-40, and General Education Board, 1930-40. His nephew a nd successor as president at Stanford, Richard Lyman, is now presid ent of the Rockefeller Foundation. Wilbur also served as Secretary of the Interior in Hoover’s"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Cabinet 1929-33. During this period, he signed the contracts for Hoover Dam, having thought up that name. The dam was not completed until after FDR took office; he maliciously ordered his Secreta ry of Interior, Harold Ickes, to change the name to Boulder Dam. Hoover p oints out in his Memoirs that “two-thirds of the work had been done during the Hoover Administration, all contracts were let as Hoover Da m, as was customary with many presidents with works named after them when th ese works were done during their administrations; on May 8, 1933, Secre tary Ickes, on orders from Roosevelt changed the name to Boulder Dam.” Roosev elt dedicated the dam Sept. 30, 1933 without mentioning Hoover or the fac t that most of the work had been done during the Hoover Administration. On March 10, 1947, the House unanimously voted to change the name back to Hoover Dam. Hoover wrote to Congressman Jack Z. Anderson, who had spon sored the bill, “When a President of the U.S. tears one’s name down that is a public defamation and an insult. I am grateful to you for removing it.” Because of the importance of the Hoover Institution in the Reagan Administration, it is important to recap the career of the man who founded it. As a mining stock promoter in London, Hoover h ad been barred from dealing on the London Stock Exchange, and his assoc iate, who apparently took the rap, went to prison for several years. Th e incident brought Hoover to the favorable attention of the Rothschilds, who made him a director of their firm, Rio Tinto. Chairman was Lord Milner, w ho founded the Round Tables, which later became the Royal Institute of I nternational Affairs and its subsidiary, the Council on Foreign Relations. In 1916, the promoters of World War I were dismayed when Germany insisted she could not continue in the war, because of shortages of food and money. The Czar’s physician, Gleb Botkin, revealed in 1931 that the Kaiser’s chief military adviser, and chief of his armies on the Russian border, Grand Duke of Hesse-Darmstadt, risked his life on a secre t mission to Russia to Czarskoe Selo, the Imperial Palace, where he asked his sister, Empress"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Alexandra, to let him talk to the Czar about making a separate peace with Germany. The Empress, fearful of criticism, refuse d to receive him, and after spending the night at the palace, he was escorted b ack to the German lines. To keep Germany in the war, Paul Warburg, head of t he Federal Reserve System, hastily arranged for credits to be routed to his brother, Max Warburg, through Stockholm to M.M. Warburg Co. Hamb urg. Food presented a more difficult problem. It was finally decided to ship it directly to Belgium as “relief for the starving Belgians”. The supplies could then be shipped over Rothschild railway lines into Germany. As director for this “relief” operation, the Rothschilds chose Herbert H oover. His partner in the Relief Commission was Emilie Francqui, chosen by Ba ron Lambert, head of the Belgian Rothschild family. The plan was so suc cessful that it kept World War I going for an additional two years, allowing t he U.S. to get into the “war to end wars”. John Hamill, author of “The Strange C areer of Herbert Hoover” states that Emile Francqui, director of Soc iete Generale, a Jesuit bank, opened an office in his bank as the National Relief and Food Committee, with a letter of authorization from the German Gov. Gen. von der Goltz. Francqui then went to London with this letter, accompanied by Baron Lambert, head of the Belgian Rothschilds, and Hugh Gibson, secretary of the American Legation in Brussels. The Report of the National Committee states that “T he National Committee and its subsidiary organizations were not subject to control of the Belgian Public Administration and neither was it ac countable to the Public as a public authority. The National Committee existed by itself according to the will of its founders and those who had given it the ir support. That is why it was sovereign in the decisions it made and excluded all control of its actions by the Public.” Hamill says, “From its commencement , the Food Division had been organized and conducted on a commercial basis. The Commission for Relief in Belgium raised its sale prices to the Nat ional Committee by an"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"amount equivalent to the profit that had formerly b een taken by it. Hoover referred to this as ‘benevolence’.” Francqui had previously been a partner of Hoover in the Kaipeng coal mine swindle in China, which set off the Boxer Rebe llion, the Chinese vowing to kill all “white devils” in China; and the Congo atrocities, where Francqui was remembered by the sobriquet, “the Butcher of th e Congo”. He was an ideal choice to be partner in a benevolent enterpri se. The National Committee report published in 1919 sho wed that as of Dec. 31, 1918 the Committee had spent $260 million. In 1921, trying to make the accounts balance, this figure was revised upwar d to $442 million showed as spent during the same period. However, $182 mil lion was unaccounted for. In Dec. 1918, Francqui showed expenditure for relief of $40 million, four times as much as for any previous month, although t he war was now over. On Jan. 13,1932, the New York Times reported widespread attacks on Hoover in the Belgian press, “that President Hoover, durin g his Belgian Relief days, had manifestly been party to a scheme to make money out of Belgium.” Hoover was then appointed U.S. Food Administrator i n Washington. Although the operation was principally run by Lewis L. Strauss of Kuhn, Loeb Co., Hoover still depended heavily on his long time associate, Edgar Rickard. On Nov. 13, 1918, Hoover sent a letter to President Wilson requesting authority for Edgar Rickard “to act in m y stead” while he was in Europe. Wilson signed the letter Nov. 16, 1918, “W hereas by virtue of exec. order Nov. 16, 1918, Edgar Rickard now exercises al l powers heretofore delegated to Herbert Hoover as U.S. Food Administra tor.” Rickard assumed the title of “Acting Food Administrator in Washingt on” according to a letter from Herbert Hoover Jan. 17, 1919, “since my depart ure to come to conference in Paris.” The U.S. Food Administration was then split into fo ur divisions, Sugar Equalization Board, Belgian Relief, U.S. Grain Corp . and U.S. Shipping Board. On Dec. 16, 1918, Wilson sent a letter to th e State Dept. an executive"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"order, “Please pay at once to the U.S. Food Adminis tration Grain Corp. $5 million from my fund for National Security and Defe nse.” The order was referred to the Secretary of Treasury for payment a nd approved. Justice Brandeis biography by Mason notes, “Norman Hapgood wrote Brandeis from London Jan. 10, 1917, ‘Herbert Hoover is the most interesting man I know. You will enjoy his experience in diplo macy, finance etc. in England, France, Belgium and Germany !” In early F ebruary he talked with justice Brandeis, who arranged for him to see Senat or McAdoo, Wilson’s son- in-law, leading to Hoover’s appointment as U.S. Foo d Administrator. On Jan. 21, 1919, the New York Times noted the Sena te debate in which Hoover was assailed for his proposed $100 mil lion request for aid to Europe. The plan was criticized by Sen. Penrose an d Sen. Gore as one that would unload the surplus of American meat packers i n Europe. Sen. Penrose asked Sen. Martin, the Democratic floor leader if H oover “is an American citizen and has ever voted in an American election ?” Martin retorted, “I do not propose to be drawn into such an irrelevantism as that”. Penrose then declared, “I do not believe he is a citizen of the U.S., who has taken no oath of office, and whose allegiance is in doubt.” The criticism so piqued Hoover that he signed a letter of resignation reciting his “four years of public service without remuneration.” It was never submitted and t urned up many years later in the personal papers of his assistant, Lewi s L. Strauss. The New York Times noted Sept. 4, 1919 that Edgar Rickard had made a speech at Stanford Univ. vigorously promoting the L eague of Nations. Hoover and Col. House were also working together to obtain Senate approval and public approval for Wilson’s League of Nations plan. The members of the Commission for Relief in Belgium team have subsequently played a very prominent role in the hi story of the U.S. Hoover became Secretary of Commerce and later President of the U.S. A team from Hoover Institution moved into Washington in 1980 as the vanguard of a “conservative” administration. Prentiss Gray, Hoov er’s assistant in U.S. Food"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Administration, became president of J.Henry Schrode r Banking Corp. in 1922. Julius H. Barnes, another Hoover associate, b ecame Chairman of J. Henry Schroder Bank. Perhaps a surplus of “relief f unds” subsequently purchased a number of American corporations. Barne s became president of Pitney Bowes, Pejepscot Paper, General Bronze, Barn es-Ames Corp., Northwest Bancorporation, and Erie & St. Lawrence C orp. Edgar Rickard, Hoover’s partner since they launched a magazine in 1909 to promote their mining stocks, had been honorary secretary of Commi ssion for Relief in Belgium; he now became president of Androscoggin W ater Power Co., president Belgo-American Trading Co; vice pres. Er ie & St. Lawrence Corp.; president Hazard Wire Rope Co., president Hazeltine Corp.; vice pres. Intercontinental Development Corp., president Latou r Corp., president Pejepscot Paper Co., and vice president Pitney Bowe s Co., chairman Wood Fibre Board Corp. Robert Grant of the U.S. Food Adm inistration became director of the U.S. Mint in Washington. Prentiss Gray became vice pres. British American Continental Corp., Electric Shareh oldings Corp., Hydroelectric Securities Corp., Manati Sugar Corp., St. Regis Paper, Swiss American Electric, Prudential Investors, Internatio nal Holdings and Investment Corp., the last two being companies cont rolled by Societe Generale and Francqui. These investment firms were organized by Belgian capitalist Capt. Alfred Loewenstein, who mysterious ly vanished from his plane while flying over the English Channel. While his closest advisers pursued their multi-mill ion dollar careers, Herbert Hoover remained dedicated to his ideals of public service. He became Secretary of Commerce, and chose as his secr etary Christian A. Herter, who had been his secretary at the Belgian R elief Commission, 1920- 21, and had also been secretary of the American Com mission to Negotiate Peace. He was secretary to Hoover 1919-24 at Comme rce; he married into the Pratt family of Standard Oil, who gave their Ma nhattan mansion as headquarters for the CFR, and he was later appointe d Secretary of State."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Charles Michelson wrote of Hoover’s career at the D ept. of Commerce, in “The Ghost Talks”, 1944, “Officially, Mr. Hoover was ever a promoter. When he took over the Dept. of Commerce, it was a reasonably modern organization. He took the Bureau of Mines f rom Interior. He dipped into the State Dept. when he realized his id ea of commercial agents abroad, and left the old commercial attaches of our legations jobless. It was not by accident that he builded for his department the hugest and perhaps the most lavishly furnished palace that housed a branch of the government.” One of Hoover’s most notable deeds, as Secretary of Commerce, was his award of the Hazeltine radio patents to his par tner since 1909, Edgar Rickard, a gift conservatively estimated to be wort h at that time one million dollars. When Hoover organized his campaign for th e presidency, he gave as his personal address Suite 2000, 42 Broadway N.Y. S uite 2000 was also listed as the office of Edgar Rickard. It was also the ad dress of Hoover’s erstwhile accomplice in the U.S. Food Administration, Julius H. Barnes, chairman of the Schroder Bank, which was to soon win notoriety as Hitler’s personal bank. Although “Wild Bill” Donovan had served Hoover fait hfully for four years while he sought the nomination to the Preside ncy, Hoover did not hesitate to cast him aside when he became a politic al liability because of his Catholic religion. The New York Times noted June 1 7, 1928, “W.A. Bechtel of San Francisco sent a congratulatory telegram to the nominee, ‘In behalf of the construction industry we congratulate the Repub lican Party on its selection of a candidate for chief Engineer of the greatest business in the world for the next four years, one of our fellow Ca lifornians who has shown yourself deserving of this great honor.” Hoover was soon preparing contracts for the largest public work of that time, the Hoover Dam, of which Bechtel was to become the chief contractor. Despite his charitable preoccupations, Hoover still engaged in free enterprise. On Dec. 7, 1919, he and his partner Ju lius H. Barnes had bought"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"the Washington Herald ; it was later acquired by the Patterson-McCormick family, and still later, by Eugene Meyer, who promp tly closed it down. Barnes also bought the Penobscot Paper Co. for $750,000 in 1919; he happened to have some extra cash on hand. The New York Times Jan. 28, 1920 that Col. House was busily developing a boom at Austin, Texas for Hoover as President, with the aid of some British friends. T he Times further noted Jan. 28, 1920 that the British Government denied that Lo rd Grey was taking part in the Hoover boom. At a dinner at the Hotel Commodore, April 23, 1920, Julius Barnes and Herbert Hoover were the guests of honor. The keyno te speaker announced that the name of Herbert Hoover was “known througho ut the civilized world”. From the time that White, Gilman and Wilbur persuad ed Hoover to gather documents for the Hoover Library, much suppo rt was made available from official sources. Even then, no one was sure just how World War I had gotten started. It was to someone’s interest to se e to it that as many pertinent and secret documents from the warring powers should be gathered in one place, gone over and, if necessary, secluded from p rying eyes. Hoover was able to call upon Gen. Pershing to provide hundreds of Army officers to aid him in his quest. In his Foreword to The Special C ollection of the Hoover Library, Hoover says that he recruited 1500 officer s from the American Army, and the Supreme Economic Council, and sent them to all parts of Europe. The New York Times Feb. 5, 1921 says that Hoover had as many as 4000 agents in Europe, going from country to country to gather these documents. Even in those pre-inflationary times, the cost of m aintaining 4000 agents in Europe must have been prohibitive. No one has ever found out who was paying them. Also, many of the documents were purc hased outright. The only expenditure Hoover ever made public was the or iginal $50,000 he had given in 1919 to establish the library. Who spent millions of dollars to put this collection together ? It is most unlikely tha t Hoover would have parted"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"with such sums, but no one has ever admitted puttin g any money into this project. The Times noted in the Hotel Commodore story that H oover, a member of the first graduating class at Stanford, h ad presented the school with a collection of 375,000 volumes. It included the most valuable collection of secret Bolshevik records in existence, among the m, the lists of the original district Soviets, which had been bought from a door keeper for $200. The Times noted that the Soviet Government had no copies of these rare archives ! Times , June 30, 1941, noted that the Bolsheviks had allo wed Hoover to remove 25 carloads of material, at a time when Russ ian refugees were permitted to leave only with the clothes on their b acks. The solicitude for Hoover’s collection may have been influenced by the fact that he had saved the infant Bolshevik regime from extinction by rush ing large quantities of food to them. Hoover’s collection also included the complete secr et files of the German War Council during World War I, a gift from President Ebert; Mata Hari’s diary, and sixty rare volumes from the Czar’ s personal library. Many of the collections were permanently sealed. Time note d that the Hoover Institution contained 300 sealed collections, which no one has ever been allowed to examine. One can only speculate whether interested parties, perhaps the Rothschilds, Hoover’s employers, determined at the close of World War I, to remove the secret documents of Europe’s warring nat ions to some far-off place, such as the West Coast of America, to lessen their political liability, damaging evidence of various acts of collusion. Th e initial organization of the material was done by a Stanford professor of histor y, Ehpraim D. Adams (1865-1930). Adams and his wife were installed in an office in Paris May 22, 1919, to receive the first shipments of documents. Other offices were opened in Berlin, London, and New York.

In 1910 he received a Ph.D from the University of Heidelberg. He had taken his undergraduate degree from Stanford 1906. He had served as vice chmn Hoover Library under Adams 1920-25. Harold H.

In 1960, the library, now known as the Hoover Insti tution on War, Revolution and Peace, was headed by Wesley Glenn Ca mpbell, who is still its director. Born in Ontario, Campbell took his degre e from Harvard 1946, PH.D. 1948, and taught there in the Economics Dept. five years. He became economist for the Chamber of Commerce 1951-54, Amer ican Enterprise Institute, 1954-60, when he became head of Hoover I nstitution. He is director of Hoover’s Belgian American Education Fou ndation, and the super secret Mont Pelerin Society, which publishes no inf ormation about its meetings. Campbell married Rita Ricardo, who conti nues to use her maiden name. She is a direct descendant of the famed econ omist, David Ricardo, whose theory of rent was appropriated by Karl Marx. Ricardo also originated “the law of wages”, which states that workers must be limited to a bare subsistence wage, the amount controlled by “taxatio n”. Ricardo also regarded workers as mere producers of “labour-time”, a theor y which Marx adopted as basic to his concept of labour. It embodies the cl assic parasitic view that the host exists only to produce sustenance for the para site, and has no right to the products and gains of his own labour. An article i n “CHANGE”, Oct. 1981 states that Rita Ricardo “helped shape Reagan’s thi nking on social security and national health insurance”, both of which are appli ed as taxation on the worker’s income. In 1964, Campbell and other Hoover personnel were t he chief advisers of the Goldwater campaign; within two decades they had become the most influential policy-makers at the White House. The New York Times Index for the period of Hoover’s presidency, 1929- 33, contains no references to either Stanford of th e Hoover Library. On June 23, 1933, the Times noted that the ex-President wou ld maintain an office at Stanford. Instead, he took a suite at New York’s W aldorf Astoria, and spent the remainder of his life there. Although he was r arely seen at the Hoover"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Institution, he presided over the annual gatherings of the West Coast powerhouse, Bohemian Grove, and was viewed as its r eigning figure. The New York Times March 24, 1935 referred to “Hoover’s Palo Alto Brain Trust”, although the Brain Trust did not take power in Washington until 1980. On June 30, 1941, a new 14 story, 210 ft. bu ilding, costing $1.2 million, was dedicated for the Hoover Institution at Stanfor d by President Seymour of Yale, a Romanesque tower housing some 5 million doc uments, many of them sealed. The Saturday Evening Post, Mar. 11, 1950, noted that Edgar Rickard, director of Hoover Institution, had raised $600,000 in 1937 towards the cost of the new building. Hoover stated that the purpose of the library was “ to expose through research the inequities of Communism”, although he had originally written it as “to demonstrate the evils of the doctrine of Kar l Marx.” A later president of Stanford, Wallace Sterling, re-edited this in 19 60 to read “to expand human knowledge, that human welfare may thus be enhanced” , a classic example of Orwell’s “Doublethink”. Sterling explained this ac t of censorship by claiming, “We cannot have research with predetermined conclus ion”. Sterling, also born in Ontario, had been a member of the Hoover re search staff from 1932- 37, was awarded the Hoover Medal. He was with the Ditchley Foundation 1962-76, and has served on the staff of HEW and the Natl War College. On July 21, 1957, the Hoover Library officially cha nged its name to Hoover Institution on War, Peace and Revolution.

On July 6, 19 43, the Lilly Fund had financed a three day conference at the institution for Bertram Wolfe, New York, Raymond Aron, France, and Richard Lowenstein of Berlin. All of these beneficiaries were old line liberals. In 1927, because of Wilbui s directorship there, th e Rockefeller Foundation gave the Hoover Library $200,000 for Sla vic Studies. The Carnegie Corp. also gave $180,000.

The 8800 acres of Stanford’s campus was originally Leland Stanford’s Palo Alto Stock Farm, which he endowed with some $20 million. The campus houses a $105 million Atomic Energy Commission laboratory built through t he influence of L.L. Strauss, chairman of AEC and director of Hoover Ins titution. Two thousand acres have been set aside for rental units. A shop ping center on the campus pays $500,000 rent annually. The 300 acres Stanfor d Research Park houses the world headquarters of Hewlett-Packard. In 1912 , Lee de Forest invented the vacuum tube in Palo Alto, launching the radio i ndustry. Prof. Louis Terman of Stanford invented the Stanford-Binet IQ t est; his son Fred became professor of electric engineering at Stanfor d, and persuaded two of his students, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, to sta rt an electronics concern. Hewlett-Packard now has $4.4 billion annual sales, 68,000 employees. Fortune says Bill Hewlett is worth $1.045 billion, Dave Pac kard is worth $2.115 billion. Prof. William Shockley invented the transistor here , launching the Silcon Valley complex. His invention was later tak en over by Fairchild Semiconductor, which is now owned by Schlumberger I nc. Shockley received little or nothing for his discovery. Stanford received $3 million from the Ford Foundati on for a medical center, and in Sept. 1959, the Ford Foundation gave Stanford $25 million, its largest gift to any educational institution. The N ew York Times noted on Oct. 10, 1977, that Stanford “known as the Harvard of the West”, had completed a $300 million fund-raising campaign head ed by Arjay Miller, former president of Ford Motor Co. The Harvard inf luence has always been strong at Stanford and the Hoover Institution.

Time, Jan. 14, 1966 noted that Stanford has a German castle at Beutelsb ach, a villa in Florence, a hotel in Tours, and occupies Harlaxton Manor, a 365 room stone mansion in Lincolnshire leased to Stanford by the Jesuits. The Guide to the Hoover Institution, published in 1 980, notes that Rita Campbell is Archivist; Robert Hessen is Deputy Arc hivist. The collection is composed of 24% North America, 26% Russia and Easte rn Europe; 27% Western Europe, and 1.8% Latin America. Page 5 of the Guide notes that the collection was inspired by two historians, Andrew D . White, president of Cornell, and Ephraim Adams of Stanford.

Although the “butcher paper weeklies” such as The Nation issue grim warnings that the Hoover Institution is deeply enga ged in the practice of “cold war anti-Communism”, the New York Times has noted that the Hoover is surprisingly liberal. Its longtime senior fellow is Sidney Hook, oldline Socialist who keeps a portrait of George Meany on h is office wall; Seymour Martin Lipset, longtime liberal closely identified with the offices of Democratic Senators Henry Jackson and Daniel Moynih an, taught at Harvard, Univ. of Calif., received the Gunnar Myrdal Prize 1 970, nat. chmn B’Nai B’Rith Hillel and United Jewish Appeal; John Bunze l, Democratic liberal now associated with the Libertarian Party; Stanley Fis cher, liberal from MIT; Joseph Pechman, the Hoover Institution resident tax expert–he had been tax expert at Brookings Institution Washington for many years before coming to Hoover; other resident liberals are Dennis J. Doll in, Theodore Draper and Peter Duignan. Lipset was quoted in an interview in the New York Times as follows: “Over half the senior fellows here are no t rightwingers, not even conservatives; they are leftwing Democrats and Soc ialists.” These are the architects of Reagan’s “rightwing” ad ministration, the usual flimflam in which the same tired old Marxists are trotted out as the inspired libertarians of a world run by the “Hard R ight”!

One of the “Hoover Hotshots” on Reagan’s team was d escribed in Omni March 1984 Continuum : “Honegger Hotline: Pres. aide Barbara Honegger was hired by Martin Anderson at Hoover Ins titution while writing a book on the draft; she wore a scarab necklace and w as the first graduate in experimental psychology at John F.

Seymour Martin Lipset, who voted for John Anderson in 1980, took a survey of the 25 Hoover fellows in 1984; he found 11 Democrats, 10 Republicans, 3 independent, and one who was not a c itizen. The Three Honorary Fellows of Hoover Institution are Ronald R eagan, Alexander Solzheinitsyn, and Frederick von Hayek. Reagan is in Washington, Solzheinitsyn lives in Vermont; von Hayek is retire d in Salzburg. None of them has any connection with the administration of the Hoover Institution. Reagan has already donated his papers to the Hoover Institution. In June, 1981, Hoover Institution held a gala recep tion at the Sheraton Carlton in Washington, with many White House offici als present. They effectively short-circuited all of Reagan’s campaig n promises for lower taxes, decreased government spending, and the goal of “get ting the government off of our backs”. The present star of the Hoover Institution is Milto n Friedman, who is credited with bringing economic disaster to Chile, Israel, the United States, and other countries in which his “monetarist” theor ies have been introduced. Friedman’s “monetarism” is the same old bankers’ sw indle of endless creation of more interest bearing debt money, requiring ever increasing taxes merely to meet the interest payments. He and Jack Kemp are n ow pushing for a “flat tax” to lock Americans into a tax corral from which they can never hope to escape. Friedman came to the Hoover in 1977 as sen ior research fellow, simultaneously accepting a post as economic consult ant to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. He and his consort, Murray Rothbard, dominate a closely interlocked network of “hard mon ey” “conservative” groups, which includes the Heritage Foundation, Mon t Pelerin Society, Cato Institute, Ludwig von Mises Institute, and American Enterprise Institute, which hold banquet meetings, always with no visible result. Their mentor is the late Ludwig von Mises, born in Austria, and fou nder of “the Austrian"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"School of Economics”, who taught at New York Univer sity from 1946 until his death. The Institute is now run by his widow, Margit Herzfeld, to whom President Reagan said, at a testimonial dinner for her husband, “You don’t know how often I consult the books of your husband before making a decision.” She still doesn’t know. At the age of 16, Milton Friedman became the proteg e of Arthur Burns at Rutgers and Columbia. Their economic principles stemmed from the “Viennese School” founded by Karl Menger and Eugen von Bauwerk. Merger taught von Hayek, Eric Voegelin and Fritz Ma chluys. At that time. Vienna was dominated by the House of Rothschild, wh ich had controlled the national debt of Austria since the Congress of Vien na in 1815. Austria’s Tyrol silver mines were owned by the Rothschilds, as were her railways. Empress Elizabeth’s closest friend was Julie de Rothschild, sister of Baron Albert, head of the Austrian House. Count Richard Coudenhove-Ka lergi, who founded the Pan European Union, was named after Richard Wag ner, one of whose students was Gustav Mahler. Mahler’s studies with Wagner were funded by Baron Albert de Rothschild. Coudenhove-Kalergi’s f ather was a close friend of Theordor Herzl, founder of Zionism. Goudenhove- Kalergi writes in his Memoirs, “At the beginning of 1924, we received a c all from Baron Louis de Rothschild; one of his friends, Max Warburg from H amburg, had read my book and wanted to get to know us. To my great sur prise, Warburg spontaneously offered us 60,000 gold marks, to tide the movement over for its first three years .... Max Warburg, who was one of the most distinguished and wisest men that I have ever come into contact w ith, had a principle of financing these movements. He remained sincerely i nterested in Pan-Europe for his entire life. Max Warburg arranged his 1925 trip to the United States to introduce me to Paul Warburg and financier Bernard Baruch.” In Chicago, Jane Adams of Hull House had been for f ive years a protege of Beatrice Webb, founder of the Fabian Soc iety.

John Dewey became head of the sociology dept. at the Univ. of Chicago; Wesley Clair Mitchell was head of the economics dep t. In 1913, they moved to Columbia University. They were later hired by B aruch at the War Industries Board, and prepared all the statistics f or American representatives at the Versailles Peace Conference. In Feb. 1920, Mitchell met with the rest of the staff of Baruch’s War Industries Board in Ne w York with a Round Table group financed by Kuhn Loeb & Go. and Lazard Freres, to found the Natl Bureau of Economic Research, of which Mitchell became director. His protege was Arthur Burns, later chmn of the Natl Bu ro, chmn Federal Reserve Governors, partner of Lazard Freres, and U. S. Ambassador to West Germany. Burns then brought in his protege, Milton Friedman, who has proposed that we legalize the sale of dope to raise $100 bil lion a year for the GNP. Wesley Clair Mitchell’s career was devoted to uniti ng the Austrian and British schools of economics in a single force to d irect the American economy. He achieved success through the careers o f his proteges, Burns and Friedman, who offer us the “flat rate” tax to pay i nterest on their bank- created debt money. It is the ancient European sys tem introduced by the House of Rothschild to loot national economies by t he rentier system of national debt. A keystone of the Friedman-Burns network is the Mon t Pelerin Society, a secretive group of economists which meet s every two years, but issues no findings or recommendations. These suppo sedly conservative hard money economists first met at Mont Pelerin, Switzer land in 1997 to oppose the leftwing statist economists who had dominated t he field for fifty years.

In 1962, the Mont Pelerin Society met at Knokke, Be lgium, announcing that “The Mont Pelerin Society takes no formal acti on, passes no resolutions, and seeks no publicity.” In 1970, the Society met in Munich, where Milton Friedman was elected president. Present were Wesle y Campbell and Martin Anderson from the Hoover Institution. In 1974, 300 members of the Society met at Brussels, where they were addressed by Milto n Friedman and his protege Murray Rothbard. Rothbard was sponsored by the Cato Institute, a “conservative” group whose director, Earl C. Ravene l, is also director of the Institute for Policy Studies, the leftwing policy-m aking organization founded by James Paul Warburg. Cato is funded by Charles K och of Kansas, head of Koch industries, who amassed a fortune of $700 mill ion. He also funds the Libertarian Party, which calls for opening U.S. bor ders to all illegal immigrants, legalizing of drugs, and other alarming recommendations. Koch funds these groups through his bank, Morgan Guarant y Trust of N.Y. Cato gave a two year grant to Rothbard to write a book, “For a New Liberty”, which says, “Before World War II, so devoted was St alin to peace that he failed to make adequate provision against Nazi atta ck.” Rothbard should have said, “So devoted was Stalin to murder that he kill ed most of his Army"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"officers, leaving him vulnerable to Nazi attack.” Rothbard asserts that the U.S. is imperialist and war-mongering, while the So viet Union is peace-loving, rational and misunderstood !

The New Republic Dec. 5, 1983 featured an article by Sidney Blumenthal, “How Lewis Lehrman Plans to Take Over America.” After examining the lavishly funded network of pseu do-rightwing foundations, it is almost a relief to go back to th e forthright Marxist bias of the foundation movement, as exemplified by the Ford Foundation. The Special Committee to Investigate Tax Exempt Foundat ion reported in 1954, “The Ford Foundation affords a good example of the use of a foundation to solve the death tax problem, and, at the same time, the problem of how to retain control of a great enterprise in the hands o f a family. Ninety per cent of the ownership of the Ford Motor Co. was transfer red to the Ford Foundation, created for the purpose. Had it not be en it was almost certain that the family would have lost control.” The Ford family paid a terrible price to save the c ompany. To prevent it from being split up, they had to turn it over to the most leftwing elements in the U.S. Norman Dodd states that while investigatin g tax exempt foundations, he interviewed H. Rowan Gaither, president of the F ord Foundation. Gaither complained about the “bad press” the Ford Foundatio n was receiving, and explained to Dodd, “Most of us here were, at one ti me or another, active in either the OSS or the State Dept., or the European Economic Administration. During those times, and without ex ception, we operated under directives issued by the White House, the sub stance of which was to the effect that we should make every effort to alte r life in the U.S. as to make"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"possible a comfortable merger with the Soviet Union .” This is still the goal of the foundation movement. In 1953, the Ford Foundation set up the $15 million Fund for the Republic, with Paul Hoffman, former head of ECA, ma rried to Baruch’s secretary, Anna Rosenberg. Directors of the Fund w ere former Zionist and labor leader Arthur Goldberg, and Henry Luce, of wh om H.L. Mencken said, “I know why Henry hires so many Communists on his m agazines. It’s because they work cheap.” The Fund for the Republic hired Earl Browder, head of the Communist Party “to study the influence of Communis m in contemporary America”. In 1968, the Fund granted $215,000 to “p romote in the U.S. the knowledge of contemporary Cuba. The funds will sup port the expenses of persons invited by the Gastro government to do rese arch in Cuba.” The National Guardian Jan. 13, 1968 pointed out that “The Ford Foundatio n plays a key part in financing and influencing almost all major civil rights groups including Congress of Racial Equality, Southern Chr istian Leadership, National Urban League, and NAACP.” The Ford Founda tion has spent many millions to promote racial agitation and possi ble civil war in America, completely polarizing the races. In this effort, i t is simply carrying on the plan inaugurated by the Rothschilds in 1865 with the Pea body Fund, the Slater Fund, and later the General Education Board, which is now the Rockefeller Foundation. It takes money to promote a civil war. Ford Foundation entered the Hispanic field by giving $600,000 to the openly revolutionary Southwest Council of La Raza in 1968, and an additional $545, 717 in 1969. Congressman Henry Gonzalez, himself a Hispanic, den ounced La Raza as fomenting “blind, stupid hatred.” Ford money has backed many revolutionary groups in the U.S. engaged in dynamiting and burning buildings, inciting riots , kidnaping and assassination.

Dahrendorf denies there are any differences in the races of mankind, and denounces any idea of “superiority” or differing sk ills as “ideological distortion”. “Homo Sociologicus” is the creature o f the social sciences, the socialized man who can be completely controlled by the forces of society."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"The Ford Foundation introduced “behaviourism” or pe ople control into the curricula at Harvard Business School throu gh the director, Donald K.

To acc omplish this goal, it was necessary to emasculate and defeat the powerful rep ublican currents which had their origin in the 14th century Renaissance, w hich, with its emphasis on the freedom of the human spirit, produced the great est cultural outpouring in the history of mankind. This individualism was imm ediately expressed in nationalism; its republican spirit was dedicated t o ending hereditary and arbitrary control and dictatorship over the lives o f the people, reaching its greatest expression in the Constitution of the Unit ed States, which was the result of rebellion. Because the ruling families of Europe are the direc t descendants of William of Orange, who chartered the Bank of Englan d in 1694, the movement to destroy nationalism and individualism h as been directed from England, but expressed in the Communist movement. The World Order has planned and executed two World Wars to restore worl d rule by the oligarchy, a world rule variously called Bolshevism, the Leagu e of Nations, or the United Nations, but never the World Order. The English control of this world movement is demon strated by the ideology of American foundations, which is created by the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations in London. In 1921, the Duke of Bedford, Marquess of Tavistock, the 11th Duke, gave a building to the In stitute to study the effect of shellstock on British soldiers who survived Worl d War I.

Tavistock Institute developed the mass brain-washin g techniques which were first used experimentally on American prisoner s of war in Korea. Its experiments in crowd control methods have been wide ly used on the American public, a surreptitious but nevertheless o utrageous assault on human freedom by modifying individual behaviour thr ough topical psychology. A German refugee, Kurt Lewin, became d irector of Tavistock in 1932. He came to the U.S. in 1933 as a “refugee”, the first of many infiltrators, and set up the Harvard Psychology Cli nic, which originated the propaganda campaign to turn the American public aga inst Germany and involve us in World War II. In 1938, Roosevelt exe cuted a secret agreement with Churchill which in effect ceded U.S. sovereign ty to England, because it agreed to let Special Operations Executive control U.S. polices. To implement this agreement, Roosevelt sent Gen. Donov an to London for indoctrination before setting up OSS (now the CIA) under the aegis of SOE- SIS. The entire OSS program, as well as the CIA ha s always worked on guidelines set up by the Tavistock Institute.

Any technique which helps to brea k down the family unit, and family inculcated principles of religion, honor , patriotism and sexual behaviour, is used by the Tavistock scientists as w eapons of crowd control. The methods of Freudian psychotherapy induce perman ent mental illness in those who undergo this treatment by destabilizing t heir character. The victim is then advised to “establish new rituals of person al interaction”, that is, to indulge in brief sexual encounters which actually s et the participants adrift with no stable personal relationships in their live s, destroying their ability to establish or maintain a family. Tavistock Institute has developed such power in the U.S. that no one achieves prominence in any field unless he has been trained in behavioural science at Tavistock or one of its subsidiaries.

Dr. P eter Bourne, a Tavistock Institute psychologist, picked Carter for President of the U.S.solely because darter had undergone an intensive brainwashing prog ram administered by Admiral Hyman Rickover at Annapolis. Paul Mellon’s Old Dominion Foundation gave Tavistock $97,000 in 1956, and $12, 000 during each of the three following years. Old Dominion also gave the Anna Freud Foundation $8000 a year. Tavistock maintains two schools at F rankfort, birthplace of the Rothschilds, the Frankfurt School, and the Sigmund Freud Institute. The “experiment” in compulsory racial integration i n the U.S. was organized by Ronald Lippert, of the OSS and the Ame rican Jewish Congress, and director of child training at the Commission on Community Relations.

Ano ther prominent Tavistock operation is the Wharton School of Financ e. A single common denominator identifies the common T avistock strategy – the use of drugs. The infamous MK Ultra program of the CIA, directed by Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, in which unsuspect ing CIA officials were given LSD, and their reaction studied like guinea p igs, resulted in several deaths. The U.S. Government had to pay millions in damages to the families of the victims, but the culprits were never indicte d. The program originated when Sandoz AG, a Swiss drug firm, owned by S.G. Wa rburg Co. of London, developed lycergic acid. Roosevelt’s advisor, Jame s Paul Warburg, son of Paul Warburg who wrote the Federal Reserve Act, and neph ew of Max Warburg who had financed Hitler, set up the Institute for P olicy Studies to promote the drug. The result was the LSD “counter-culture” of the 1960s, the “student revolution”, which was financed by $25 million from the CIA. One part of MK Ultra was the Human Ecology Fund; t he CIA also paid Dr. Herbert Kelman of Harvard to carry out fur ther experiments on mind control. In the 1950s, the CIA financed exten sive LSD experiments in Canada. Dr. D.Ewen Cameron, president of the Canad ian Psychological Assn., and director of Royal Victorian Hospital, Mo ntreal, received large payments from the CIA to give 53 patients large dos es of LSD and record their reactions; the patients were drugged into we eks of sleep, and then given electric shock treatments.

This is the legacy of the War burgs and the CIA. Their principal agency, the Institute for Policy Studies, was funded by James Paul Warburg; its co-founder was Marcus Raskin, protege of McGeorge Bundy, president of the Ford Foundation. Bundy had Raskin appointed to the post of President Kennedy’s personal representative on the National Security Council, and in 1963 funded Students for Democratic Society, through which the CIA operated the drug culture. Today, the Tavistock Institute operates a $6 billio n a year network of foundations in the U.S., all of it funded by U.S. t axpayers’ money. Ten major institutions are under its direct control, with 400 subsidiaries, and 3000 other study groups and think tanks which originate many t ypes of programs to increase the control of the World Order over the Am erican people.

The Ditchley Foundation is headquartered at Ditchle y Park, near Oxford, in a castle built for the Earl of Lichfield in the 16th century; the present Earl of Lichfield is a cousin of Queen Eliz abeth, and is known as a photographer of beautiful women. Ditchley Park was given to the foundation by Ronald and Marietta Tree. Ronald Tree, a godson of Marshall Field, was for many years a high official in British intellige nce.

One of the principal but little known operations of the Rockefeller Foundation has been its techniques for controlling world agriculture. Its director, Kenneth Wernimont, set up Rockefeller con trolled agricultural programs throughout Mexico and Latin America. The independent farmer is a great threat to the World Order, because he produ ces for himself, and because his produce can be converted into capital, which gives him independence. In Soviet Russia, the Bolsheviks bel ieved they had attained total control over the people; they were dismayed to find their plans threatened by the stubborn independence of the smal l farmers, the kulaks. Stalin ordered the OGPU to seize all food and anima ls of the kulaks, and to starve them out. The Chicago American Feb. 25, 1935 carried a front page headline, six MILLION PERISH IN SOVIET FAMINE: Pea sants’ Crops"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Seized, They and their Animals Starve. To draw att ention from this atrocity, it was later alleged that the Germans, not the Soviets , had killed six million people, the number taken from the Chicago American headline by a Chicago publicist. The Communist Party, the Party of the Peasants and Workers, exterminated the peasants and enslaved the workers. Many totalitarian regimes have found the small farmer to be their big gest stumbling block. The French Reign of Terror was directed, not against th e aristocrats, many of whom were sympathetic to it, but against the small farmers who refused to turn over their grain to the revolutionary tribunal s in exchange for the worthless assignats. In the United States, the fou ndations are presently engaged in the same type of war of extermination ag ainst the American farmer. The traditional formula of land plus labor for the farmer has been altered due to the farmer’s need for purchasing pow er, to buy industrial goods needed in his farming operations. Because of this need for capital, the farmer is especially vulnerable to the World Order’s manip ulation of interest rates, which is bankrupting him. Just as in the Soviet Un ion, in the early 1930s, when Stalin ordered the kulaks to give up their sma ll plots of land to live and work on the collective farms, the American small fa rmer faces the same type of extermination, being forced to give up his small plot of land to become a hired hand for the big agricultural soviets or trus ts. The Brookings Institution and other foundations originated the monetary progr ams implemented by the Federal Reserve System to destroy the American farm er, a replay of the Soviet tragedy in Russia, with the one proviso that the fa rmer will be allowed to survive if he becomes a slave worker of the giant t rusts. Once the citizen becomes aware of the true role of the foundations, he can understand the high interest rates, high taxes, the destruction of the family, the degradation of the churches into forums for revolution, the subversion of the universities into CIA cesspools o f drug addiction, and the halls of government into sewers of international es pionage and intrigue.

Delano. Delano also was an original in corporator of the Brookings Institution and the Carnegie Endowment fo r International Peace.

They have also been closely linked with the American Internat ional Corporation, which was formed to instigate the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. Delano, an uncle of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, was on the original B oard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in 1914. His brother-in-law founded the influential Washington law firm of Covington and Burling. The Delanos and other ruling families of the World Order trace their line age directly back to William of Orange and the regime which granted the charter of the Bank of England. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, Lady Elizabeth Bowes- Lyon, is the daughter of the 14th Earl of Sirathmor e. When William of Orange invaded England in 1688, the Scottish lords, who had been loyal to James II, were the last to capitulate. Patrick Lyo n took the oath of fealty to William in 1690, and became the first Earl of Strat hmore. The family resides at Glamis Castle, which was made famous by Shakespe are’s play, “Macbeth”. The present Lord Glamis is Michael Fergus Bowes-Lyo n, heir of the 17th Earl of Strathmore, who holds additional titles of Earl of Kinghorne, Viscount Lyon, Farnedyce, Sydlaw, and Strathdichtie. APPENDIX I After gaining control of the national government, t he Rockefeller Foundation moved to seize control of the state legi slatures. The move began in Colorado, where the Rockefellers had perpetrated the infamous “Ludlow Massacre” of workers at their Colorado Fuel & Iron plant. State Senator Henry Wolcott Toll, a Denver lawyer and graduate of Harvard Law School, spearheaded the organization of the American Legisl ators Association in 1925. Time, April 27, 1936, noted that Toll in 193 0 got financial aid from the Spelman Rockefeller Fund and moved the organization to the campus of"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Rockefeller’s University of Chicago. Time noted, “ Today the Capitol of the U.S. is still in Washington, but so far as the stat es individually have any point of contact, it is Mr. Toll’s office building in Chi cago. Presently Rockefeller money is to erect a $500,000 building on Chicago’s Midway to house these secretariats, a sort of League of Nations Palace fo r the local governments of the 48 states.” This became the Council of State Governments at 131 3 60th St. Chicago, from which address the Rockefeller Foundat ion controlled the state legislatures and ramrodded their programs through m ostly unsuspecting state bodies. Time also noted that Toll’s plans were approved by a principal character in this story, Frederick A. Delano. “His sentiments were echoed with approval by Franklin Roosevelt’s uncle, Freder ick A. Delano, who, as chairman of the President’s Committee on National R esources, was there to lend his advice.” Thus we have the founder of the Brookings Instituti on guiding foundation control of the state legislatures. The Council of State Governments has now moved to Lexington, Kentucky, w here it at present comprises the Conference of Chief Justices, Confere nce of State Court Administrators, and the National Associations of At torney Generals, Secretaries of State and State Auditors, State Purc hasing Offices, Lieutenant Governors, and State Legislators. The governors of the 50 states comprise the membership of the Council of State Governments. CHAPTER EIGHT The Rule of The Order “And behold at evening tide trouble; and before the morning he is n ot. This is the portion of them that spoil us and the lot of them tha t rob us.”– ISAIAH 17:14 ."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":" Five men rule the world. None of them holds public office, but they choose who shall hold office in the nations. These five men comprise the apex of the pyramid of power, the World Order. We may ask, Why should there be a World Order ? Is it not sufficient to h old absolute power in a single nation, or in a group of nations ? The answ er is No, because of the nature of international travel, international trade , and international finance. International travel requires that a person may tra vel in peace from one nation to another, without being molested. Excepting case s of anarchy, revolution or war, this requirement can usually be met. Internat ional trade requires that traders of one nation can go to another nation, tra nsact their business, and return with their goods or their profits. This req uirement too is usually met. If not, the offended nation can exercise military f orce, as Great Britain did in its Opium Wars. It is the third requirement, international finance, which called into being the World Order. In earlier days, when inter national trade consisted of barter, payment in gold or silver or piracy, the se izure of goods by force, there was no need for a world arbiter to determine the va lue of instruments of trade. The development of paper money, stocks, bon ds, acceptances and other negotiable instruments necessitated a power, able to exercise influence anywhere in the world, to declare that a piece of p aper represented one billion dollars in real wealth, or even one dollar in real wealth. An entry on a computer, flashed from London to New York, states t hat someone owes five billion dollars to someone else. Without genuine p ower backing, no such sum could ever be collected, regardless of the factuali ty or morality of the debt. As anyone in the Mafia can tell you, you don’t collect unless you are willing to break legs. The World Order is always prepared to break legs, and break them they do, by the millions. What would have happened to the earliest settlers i n America if they had gone to the Indians and said, “Give us your goo ds and the deeds to your"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"homes and lands. In return, we will give you this beautifully printed piece of paper.” The Indians would, and did, attack them. If the settlers arrived with an army led by a Pizaro or a Cortez, they took the lands without a piece of paper. The World Order rules with its pieces of paper, but behind every paper is a force which can be employed anywhere in the wo rld. The force may be disguised by various subterfuges as international a greements, associations or other camouflage, but its base is always force. The World Order rules through a simple technique, D ivide and Conquer (Divide et impera). Every natural or unnat ural division among people, every occasion for hatred or greed, is expl oited and exacerbated to the limit. The polarization of racial and ethnic group s in the U.S. is accelerated by a flood of government decrees, originating in found ation “studies”, which are designed solely to set American against American. Only in this way can the World Order maintain its iron grip on the daily liv es of the people. The World Order also rules by the principle of “1984” – no groups of two or more people are allowed to gather unless the World Order has a representative present. If you start a club of dan delion fanciers, the Order will send someone who will be quietly helpful, avoid tak ing the front position, and who will offer to pay the rent of a meeting place o r the printing of the minutes. In more radical groups, the Order’s repre sentative will be the first to suggest dynamiting a building, assassinating an off icial, or other violent action. The international terrorism of the Communist Party originated in a small club of German and French workingmen in Paris , dedicated to quiet reading and discussion, until Karl Marx joined. It was then converted into a revolutionary group. This one example explains the Order’s determination to allow no group, however insignificant, to remain un monitored. The World Order adopted the Hegelian dialectic, the dialectic of materialism, which regards the World as Power, and the World as Realit y. It denies all other powers and all other realities. It functions on th e principle of thesis, antithesis"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"and a synthesis which results when the thesis and a ntithesis are thrown against each other for a predetermined outcome. Thus the W orld Order organizes and finances Jewish groups; it then organizes and finances anti-Jewish groups; it organizes Communist groups; it then or ganizes and finances anti- Communist groups. It is not necessary for the Orde r to throw these groups against each other; they seek each other out like heat-seeking missiles, and try to destroy each other. By controlling the size and resources of each group, the World Order can always predetermine the outcome . In this technique, members of the World Order are o ften identified with one side or the other. John Foster Dulles arr anged financing for Hitler, but he was never a Nazi. David Rockefeller may be cheered in Moscow, but he is not a Communist. However, the Order always t urns up on the winning side. A distinguishing trait of a member of the Wo rld Order, although it may not be admitted, is that he does not believe in any thing but the World Order. Another distinguishing trait is his absolute contem pt for anyone who actually believes in the tenets of Communism, Zionism, Chris tianity, or any national, religious or fraternal group, although the Order ha s members in controlling positions in all of these groups. If you are a sin cere Christian, Zionist or Moslem, the World Order regards you as a moron unwo rthy of respect. You can and will be used, but you will never be respect ed. It has taken centuries of patient effort for the Wo rld Order to attain the power it exercises today. Its origins as an intern ational force go back to the Phoenician slave-traders, continues through the Phn ariot families of the Byzantine Empire, then the Venetian and Genoese tra ders and bankers of the Middle Ages, who moved into Spain and Portugal, and later into England and Scotland. By the 14th century, the Genose controll ed the Scottish landlords. The Imperial Family of the Byzantine Empire, the Pa leologues (meaning 'the Word’) were attacked by the Gnostic faction, whose materialistic Aristotelian philosophy was the forerunner of Hegelian dialectic and Marxism. The Paleologues devoutly believed in the Christian fait h, as expressed by the"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Orthodox Rite. The materialistic Venetian and Geno ese armies, with the aid of the Turkish “infidels”, looted and conquered Con stantinople, the legendary “City of God”. The Byzantine survivors recreated t heir culture in Russia, with Moscow as “the third Rome”. The plan to destroy th e Orthodox Church and its Romanov (new Rome) leader was the hidden goal o f the First World War. The victors came away with one billion dollars of t he Romanov fortune, after achieving the defeat of their hated enemy, the Orth odox Church. During the Middle Ages, European power centers coal esced into two camps, the Ghibellines, those who supported the Emp eror’s Hohenstaufen family, (an Italian adaptation of Weinblingen, the name of the Hohenstaufen estate), and the Guelphs, from Welf, the German pri nce who competed with Frederick for control of the Holy Roman Empire. Th e Pope then allied himself with the Guelphs against the Ghibellines re sulting in their victory. All of modern history stems directly from the struggle between these two powers. The Guelphs, also called the Neri, or Blac k Guelphs, and Black Nobility, were the Normans who conquered England in the 11th century; the Genoese who backed Robert Bruce in his conquest of Scotland, and who supported William of Orange in his seizure of the t hrone of England. William’s victory resulted in the formation of the Bank of England and the East India Company, which have ruled the world sinc e the 17th century. Every subsequent coup d’etat, revolution and war ha s centered in the battle of the Guelphs to hold and enhance their power, which is now the World Order. The power of the Guelphs grew through their control of banking and international trade. It was extended through the I talian centers to the north of Florence, in Lombardy, which became great financ ial centers. All Italian bankers, including the Genoese, the Venetians, and Milanese, were referred to as “Lombards”; Lombard, in German, means “deposit bank”; the Lombards were bankers to the entire Medieval world. Modern history begins with the transfer of their operations north to Hamburg, Amst erdam, and finally to London."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"The great American fortunes originated with the Gue lph slave trade to the colonies. Many of the slave traders doubled in piracy. Trinity Church, whose leading vestryman later was J.P. Morgan, was originally known as “the church of the pirates”. Capt. William Kidd provide d the material to build it in 1697, and a pew was reserved for him. He was arres ted the next year, and hanged in chains at Newgate. In 1711, a slave mark et was set up on Wall Street near the church, and functioned there for ma ny years. Two of the most powerful influences in the world to day are the international drug trade, which began with the East India Co., and international espionage, which began with the Bank of England. The East India Co. was granted a charter in 1600 in the clos ing days of Queen Elizabeth’s reign. In 1622, under James I, it beca me a joint stock company. In 1661, in an attempt to retain his throne, Charle s II granted the East India Co. the power to make war. From 1700 to 1830, the East India Co. gained control of all India, and wrested the historic mono noly of opium from the Great Moguls. The Crown periodically tried to maintain control of the monster it had unleashed. State Papers (Domestic) Interregnum, xv i, No. 97 (1649-51) states, “Whereas severall warrants have bine obtained by the East I ndia Company, for the transporting of severall great quantities of Gold an d Silver the Ilk som tymes is granted to severall merchants and others upon ther pe tion and suggestions, and weras under cider of thes warrants to divers other gre at soms of money, both English Gold and Silver is transported out of the nati on, wch might be prevented yf the stat would apoynt a swroen controlled one skilled in th is affaire, to tak a vew and serch of all badge and cases of tresur, that are t ransported out of the nation, and to see to the packing and making up of said tresur , and that ther be sent no more, then, what the stat gives licence for, both f or quantytie and quality, and registered, and returned yearly to the council of stat , and that the sd controller for his view and search and sealing and marking it up shal l demand and have tow shillings appon every hundred pounds sterling by tayl, or the valew of every hundred pounds sterling, if that the Gold or Silver should be in bares or ingots, for all Gold and Silver that shall be exported by licence, either the East India"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Company or any other person whomsoever, and that it shall not be lawful for any man to transport Gold or Silver befor it be vewed and ex amined by Tho. Violet or his sufficient debity, and registered.” Government supervision of control of international movements of gold and silver has been a national problem since C icero inveighed against it in the Roman Forum. Sir Walter Raleigh pointed out , in his “Select Observations of the Incomparable Sir Walter Raleigh ,” MDCXCVI p.6, “1. That Nation Can only be in a prosperous Estate that hath a proportionable quantity of Silver or Gold to ballance the Strength and trade of its neighboring Nations. 2. That whilst the Current Cash of this Ki ngdom can be converted into Bullion, and so made a trading Commodity (as hath been practis’d this hundred Years) ’twill either be conveyed to be best Market, or wrought in Plate at home, notwithstanding the utmost rigour and vigiliancy, to the great and daily Consumption of the Coin, and Detriment of the Nation . That raising the value of our Coin, is the only certain means to keep it in t he Nation to make us a rich and thriving State, to recover our lost Trade, and the best Bulwa rk and Defence against all the Attacks of our Enemies. That contrary to th e Policy of Nations, our standard Coin is of greater value in all places than at home (Spain only excepted) for which reason we bring Spanish Mony hither, and f or the same Reason our Mony is transported to other places, to the great Impoverishm ent of the Nation.” Sir Walter Raleigh, a patriot, saw that the machina tions of the international money dealers were bringing ruin to m any Englishmen, and tried to stop it. They in turn conspired against him, an d had him beheaded. The Order invariably enlists “the law” against its enem ies. The East India Co. originated as the London Stapler s, was later known as the Lodon Mercers Co., merchant guilds which hel d monopolies over certain avenues of commerce. It was a direct offsh oot of the commercial banking establishments of northern Italy, Venice an d Genoa. Related firms were the German Hansa, and the Hanse of the Low Cou ntries, which was headquartered in Bruges. It was also allied with t he Levant Co. and the Anglo-Muscovy Co. Sebastian Cabot, whose descendant s are prominent in American banking and intelligence, raised the seed money for Anglo-Muscovy"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"in Italy and London. The company operated northern overland trade routes from the Baltic to India and China. Other related firms were the London Company, chartered in 1606 to establish The Virgini an Plantation on a communistic basis, and the Plymouth Company, whose descendants control the New England business world. The “City” banks, which dominate American finance a nd politics (code name for banks for the “City”, financial district o f London), descend directly from East India and Bank of England operations. Th e Rockefeller Empire is the most prominent scion of this dynasty. To aid their control of finance and politics, the G uelphs perpetuated a host of cults deriving from the Manicheans, which i n turn derived from the cults of Babylonia and Ira, from the Atys cultus of the Caucasian area, and from Hindu pantheism. Their offshoots include the Bogmils of the Balkans, the Paulicans of Asia Minor, the anabaptists, commu nists and antinomians, centering in the (Catharists, the Albigensians of s outhern France, the patarenes of northern Italy, and the English Savoya rds). These gnostic faiths developed into the Rosicrucians, Swedenborgians, Un itarians, the Fabian Society, and the World Council of Churches. The En glish Savoyards became active in the London Staplers and the rise of ocean ic commerce, by using the Venetian-Flanders galley, which brought the lateen sail into Europe from, southeast Asia. The Savoyards formed an extreme le ftwing party, led by John Ball, which called for the nationalisation of all l and. The Wycliffe-Lollards- Savoyards-Staplers formed the King’s Party against the landed nobility (republicanism) and parliament. Then as now, the l eftwing sought ownership of all land through an absolute ruler and a totalit arian centralized government. This leftwing alliance culminated in the University of London. The University of London, which received a $2 million g rant in 1924 from Beardsley Rural as head of the Laura Spelman Rockef eller Fund, and many other grants from American foundations houses Gresh am College and the London School of Economics, where Harold Laski taug ht John F. Kennedy"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"and David Rockefeller the principles of the World O rder. The University of London was originally financed by Jeremy Bentham of the East India Co., and John Stuart Mill, whose friend, investment banker G eorge Grote, gave the University of London 6000 pounds to study mental he alth, the origin of the present worldwide “mental health” movement. Grote also contributed 500 pounds to finance the July Revolution in France in 1830, which put Louis Philippe on the throne. It was Bentham who first coined the slogan later ta ken up by Karl Marx, “the greatest good for the greatest number”, which has been so useful in inflaming the masses, the Marxist flim flam that you can best serve your interests by serving others. Bentham’s business pa rtner was manufacturer Robert Owen, and atheist who taught free love. Lik e most do-gooders, Owen’s cotton mills in Asia, associated with the Ea st India Co., caused bankruptcies and great misery in India. In 1824, O wen bought Father Rapp’s anabaptist commune in America, Harmonie on the Waba sh, renaming it New Harmony. Owen’s associate at New Harmony was Franc es (Fanny) Wright, who initiated the practice of free love in America. She also started the Women’s Equal Rights Movement, which was intended t o break up families by inciting war between husband and wife. She trav elled through the South, preaching the amalgamation of the races, and founde d a commune in Tennessee for Negro freedmen. In 1829, she helped found the Workingmen’s Party in New York City, which later be came the Communist Party. Her grandson, Rev. Wm. Norman Guthrie, who married Anne Norton Stuart, became known as the Red Vicar at his church , St. Marks in the Bowerie, which welcomed Luciferians to its services . A principal offspring of the East India Co. was the Fabian Society, founded by Sidney and Beatrice Potter Webb, (whose father, Richard Potter, was a close friend of John Stuart Mill). Beatrice’ s sister Georgina married Daniel Meinertzhagen, chairman of Lazard Bros. Lond on; another sister, Thersa, married Sir Alfred Cripps. John Stuart Mil l’s father, James, who was"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"with the East India Co., named his son after John S tuart, head of East India Co. John Stuart Mill was secretary of the East Indi a Co. from 1856 until its dissolution. One of Mill’s most famous disciples, David Ricardo, originated the Theory of Rents, later expounded by the Marxist s, and the “bare subsistence” law of wages. His descendant, Rita Ri cardo, married to Wesley Campbell, head of the Hoover Institution, now advis es President Reagan on social security. Robert Owen, promoter of the New Harmony commune, w as a principal backer of John Quincy Adams’ Presidential campaign. Adams had withheld support from Madison during the War of 181 2, and had threatened secession from the Union. As Secretary of State, A dams had drafted the Monroe Doctrine, which gave the British East India Co. control of all Latin American markets, while keeping out all of its comp etitors ! T.D. Allman, in “The Doctrine That Never Was”, Harper’s, Jan. 1984, revealed that Monroe actually pledged not to interfere with any European power, unless they set up “new” colonies. The agreement, which was not even called the “Monroe Doctrine” until many years later, guaranteed the Ea st India Company its markets in this hemisphere. When Britain violated the agreement in 1833 by seizing the Malvinas, the U.S. did nothing. The New England banking and shipping interests cont rolled by Adams’ group created the Second Bank of the United States by repeated stock speculation campaigns, marked by typical bouts of h yperinflation and sudden deflation, which gave them control of millions of a cres of farm lands throughout the Mississippi Valley from the Great La kes to the Gulf of Mexico. This gave them enormous political influenc e in this entire region, allowing them to seed the southern Mississippi Vall ey with fanatical Secessionists and Abolitionists, whose revolutionar y acts made the Civil War inevitable. Owen also coined the term Socialism; he was a business partner of a cotton manufacturer named Engels, whose son la ter became his political"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"disciple, and still later became the partner of Kar l Marx in founding the world Communist movement. The trial of the conspirators has been evident thro ughout the history of Europe since the Middle Ages. In 1547, the Republi c of Venice had learned of an anti-Christian conspiracy, and strangled its leaders, Julian Trevisano and Francis de Rugo. The surviving conspirators, Ochin us, Laelius Socinus, Peruta, Gentilis, Jacques Chiari, Francis Lenoir, D arius Socinus, Alicas, and the Abbe Leonard, now spread their poisonous doctri nes of hatred throughout Europe. Their message of anarchy, athei sm and immorality, levelling and revolution brought bloodshed in every subsequent upheaval on the Continent. In Germany, Adam Weishaupt, Prof. o f Canon Law at the University of Munich, and later at Coburg-Gotha, be came the Nominal head of the Illuminati; its corresponding branch in Ita ly was the Alta Vendita, whose first leader was an Italian Nobleman, B. Nubi us. His principal agent was Piccolo Tigre, a Jewish banker and jeweler who traveled for the Alta Vendita throughout Europe. In 1822, his instructio ns to the chapters were confiscated and published, from which we excerpt : “We do not cease to recommend to you, to affiliate persons of every cla ss and every manner of association, no matter what kind, only provided tha t mystery and secrecy shall be the dominant characteristic. Under a pretext mo st futile, but never political or religious, created by yourselves, or better yet, cause to be created by others, associations, having in common music, the fine arts for object. Then infiltrate the poison into those chosen arts; infiltrate it in little doses. A prince who has not a kingdom to expect, is a good fortune for us. There are many of them in that plight. These poor princes will serve our end s, while thinking to labour only for their own. They form a magnificent signbo ard, and there are always fools enough to be found who are ready to compromis e themselves in the service of a conspiracy, of which some prince or ot her seems to be thr ringleader. There is little morality even among th e most moral of the world, and one goes fast in the way of that progress. A g ood hatred, thoroughly"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"cold, thoroughly calculated, is of more worth than all these artificial fires and all these declarations on the platform. Presently, we shall have a printing establishment at Malta placed at our disposal. We shall then be able with impunity, with a sure stroke, and under the British flag, to scatter from one end of Italy to the other, books, pamphlets, etc. w hich the Alta Vendita shall judge proper to put into circulation.” Karl Rothschild, son of Mayer Amschel, then became head of the Alta Vendita. On May 1, 1776, Adam Weishaupt issued further instr uctions to the Illuminati in Bavaria, “We labour first of all to d raw into our Association all good and learned writers. This we imagine will be the easier obtained, as they must derive an evident advantage from it. Next to such men we seek to gain the masters and secretaries of the Post-Offices in order to facilitate our correspondence.” The Tasso family of Bologna, late r Thurn und Taxis, gained control of post offices and intelligence wor k in Europe and held that power for five centuries. Although these groups su rfaced as charitable or fine arts organizations, their goals of anarchy were con cealed in all their efforts. In the twentieth century, they culminated in the Leagu e of Nations, the United Nations, the communist Party, the Royal Institute o f International affairs, the Council on Foreign Relations, the foundations, and a host of lesser groups. Count Coudenhove-Kalergi’s Pan Europe Movement, wit h its powerful backing by aristocrats and international financiers , was represented in the U.S. by its American branch, founded by Herbert Hoover a nd Col. House, who were also stumping the U.S. for ratification of the League of Nations. Coundenhove Kalergi mentioned in his autobiogrphy t hat he had been financed by the Rothschilds and Warburgs, and in th e U.S., by Paul Warburg and Bernard Baruch. He was connected with the Thur n und Taxis family. His grandfather, Count Francis Coudenhove-Kalergi, Austrian Ambassador in Paris, had married Marie Kalergi in 1850.

A recent premier of Greece, Emmanuel Tsoud eros, was a Kalergi. Melchior Palyi, in “The Twilight of Gold”, reveals the power plays of the World Order in international finance, when he q uotes from the Diary of Governor Emile Moreau of the Bank of France. Palyi says, “In October, 1926, Governor Emile Moreau of the Bank of France s ent his closest collaborator to London to explore the intentions of Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England. Pierre Quesnay, t hen general manager of the Bank of France 1926-30, and Bank for Internatio nal Settlements 1930-37, brought back a report which was recorded by Moreau : 'Quesnay also gives me interesting views about the ambitions of Montagu Norman and the group of financiers who surround him : Sir Otto Niemeyer , Sir Arthur Salter, Sir Henry Strakosch, Sir Robert Kindersley they are str iving to make London the great international financial centre. But those cl ose to Norman state this is not his objective ... he wants more than anything e lse to witness the setting up of links between the various banks of issue ... The economic and financial organization of the world appears to the Governor o f the Bank of England to be the major task of the Twentieth Century. In his view politicians and political institutions are in no fit state to direc t with the necessary competence and continuity this task of organization which he w ould like to see undertaken by central banks, independent at once of government s and of private finance. Hence his campaign in favour of completely autonomo us central banks, dominating their own financial markets and deriving their power from common agreement among themselves. They would succ eed in taking out of the political realm those problems which are essent ial for the development and prosperity of the national financial security, distribution of credit, movement of prices. They would thus prevent intern al political struggles from harming the wealth and the economic advancemen t of nations.”"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"In short, Norman wished to see the imposition of th e World Order over the financial affairs of the nations. It was this agreement among the central banks, rather than the front organization, the League of Nations, which became their final instrument of power. Cruc ial to these arrangements was the monetarist school, the Austrian School of E conomics, an outgrowth of the Pan-Europe movement. Margit Herzfeld notes in her biography of Ludwig von Mises that he participated in Count Coud enhove-Kalergi’s Pan Europe movement in 1943. He had been brought to th e U.S. in 1940 by a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation of $2500 a ye ar to work at the Natl. Bureau of Economic Research, which grant was renewe d in 1943. Von Mises’ pupils, Arthur Burns and Milton Friedman now expoun d the monetarist theory through a network of supersecret “conservati ve” think tanks led by the Mont Pelerin Society. Herzfeld says that von Mises ’ most famous protégé was the Soviet apologist Murray Rothbard. One of the most influential conspirators was Walter Rathenau of Germany. He greeted the First World War ecstatical ly as the golden opportunity to establish world socialism. He wrote on July 31, 1916, “For years I had foreseen the twilight of the nations th at I had heralded in my speeches and writings.” (A People’s State, by Rath enau). The notion became established that the state is no longer to be regar ded as the importunate poor relation and fobbed off grudgingly with a tithe, bu t that it is entitle to dispose of the capital and income of all its members at its own free will. Rathenau’s dictum was enacted into law by the far-reaching and multi-billion entitlement programs of Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society, when he persuaded Congress to levy against all of the capital and inc ome of the American people placing it at his disposal to achieve World Order p olitical goals, and finally forcing the nation to the verge of bankruptcy. Rathenau wrote “In Days to Come”, 1921, “No part of the world is now closed to us. No Material tasks are beyond our powers. All the treasures of earth are within our grasp. No thought remains hidden. Every"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"undertaking can be put to the task and realized. T he fertilizing distribution of the possessions of the world is our task. We must discover the force that will effect and up and down movement of the masses.” In “The New Society”, 1921, Rathenau wrote, “A far reaching policy of socialization is necessary and urgent ... The goal of the world revolution upon which we have entered means in its material aspect the melting of all society into one.” This was the “levelling” effect which was a key goa l of the conspirators, the Illuminati and the Alta Vendita, resulting in a narchy and the breaking down of national and class borders. Before he coul d realize his dream of World Socialism, Rathenau was murdered. Ortega noted the phenomenon of levelling in “The Re volt of the Masses,” “A hurricane of farcicality, everywhere an d in every form, is presently raging over the lands of Europe. Almost all the positions taken up and proclaimed are false ones. We are living in co mic fashion, all the more comic the more apparently tragic is the mask adopte d put on. The comic exists wherever life has no basis of inevitableness on which a stand is taken without reserves. Never as now have we these lives without substance or art – deracines from their own destiny – who let themse lves float on the lightest current.” Ortega was commenting on the most striking phenomen on of the twentieth century, the hegemony of parasitism which was attained through the World Order. It was the Congress of 1815 at Vienna which unleashed the rats from their nests, nor is it accidental that the Vie nnese School of Economics has become the principal vehicle through which the World Order maintains its political and financial power. After crushing Napoleon, the emerging oligarchy, which owed no allegiance to any nation o r to any philosophy of life, attained power because it knew how to defeat its fo es, the republicans and individualists of Europe; but its foes had no idea how to combat, or even to identify, its cleverly camouflaged enemy, because t hese people were a"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"biological throwback in the continuing development of humanity. They were persons who were unable to become productive member s of any society, and who could exist only by maintaining a parasitic att achment upon a host. Incredibly, they seized upon this striking differen ce as a sign that they had been chosen to rule all of mankind ! Initially no more than a harmless illusion, this self-deception was transformed into an evidence of “superiority”. Their biological uniqueness, their committal to a parasitic mode of life, became their principal advantage in attain ing their goals. They setup techniques of immediately recognizing each other in any part of the world. They resolved to act always cohesively as well-trai ned and determined phalanx against their unwitting opposition. They made full use of their qualities of non-allegiance and nonalignment, which was actually enmity, undying hatred towards all nations, races and creeds of the host p eoples who tolerated their presence. This freedom from all loyalties and mora l codes of the kinds which governed all other groups gave them an enormous tac tical advantage over those whom they planned to enslave and destroy. The conspirators knew that their parasitic way of l ife would not be long endured by any host. They had to set up a program to subdue and overcome all governments, all religious creeds, all group lo yalties, and replace them with their own World Order, which would allow any type o f perversion, as long as the host peoples tolerated the presence of the para site. The old morality had been based upon the duties and responsibilities of the citizen to raise a family, attend church, and support his nation. The “new mo rality”, the “liberation theology”, swept away all duties of the citizen. H e now only had single duty, to obey the World Order. In return, he was relieve d of duties, and was free to gratify his “needs”, his sexual desires, perverted gratifications with children and animals, abandonment of monogamous life. The n ew morality reduced the citizen to a mere animal, which was what the Wo rld Order required in order to perpetuate its parasitic way of life."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Society was now replaced by a mere facade of societ y. Only one crime would be severely punished – any resistance to the World Order. Murder, rape, arson, armed robbery, incest, child molestati on, alcoholism, drug addition, homosexuality – all would be excused as m inor aberrations, as long as the World Order was allowed to function without hindrance. One former crime, treason, now vanished, because national loya lties no longer existed. No one was expected to be “loyal” to the World Order, except its own members. The host peoples, the slaves, would never be asked for loyalty – only for obedience. Despite this new “tolerance”, which was in itself a revolution against the innate moral codes of all peoples, many citizen s continued to resist enslavement by the World Order. Famines, riots, re volutions and wars were instigated to get rid of the troublemakers, but a m ore universal restraint was required. This was found in drugs. In Asia, for c enturies assassins had been sent to carry out their duties after being given qu antities of drugs (assassin comes from the word for hasheesh). The World Order realized that drugs would provide the means of behavioral psychology or people control, which they had been seeking. The opium clippers began to sail from England to the Far East. By pushing drugs among the Asian masses, they stupefied and controlled them, reaping not only a substantial cas h flow, but the raw materials needed for their Industrial Revolution. In the twentieth century, the foundations began to stupefy the European and Ameri can population with drugs, the final step in the enthronement of the Wo rld Order. They had eradicated the last serious resistance to their pro gram. All conspiratorial societies for the past thousand years have sought a single goal – hegemony of parasitism. Bharati Darm a holds that the world is an order or Cosmos – that it is not chaos – it is n ot thrown together. Parasitism’s existential philosophy holds that man is thrown into the world without plan or program. This is the basic concept of parasitism, which finds itself in the world with only one mission : to fin d a host or perish. Many"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"physicists now claim that the universe is the resul t of an accidental explosion which threw its components hither and yon, with no plan or order, an atheistic concept which denies that there is either a Logician or Logic to the universe. Darma states that it is the desire for t he life of form which produces the universe, that there is a World Order by which the universe is upheld. The parasite denies that there is a world order of the universe, or any desire for form in the universe, or that any form e xists. Therefore, the parasite is free to impose his own World Order, whi ch has no organic relationship to the universe or to form. The hegem ony of parasitism is dedicated solely to maintaining its position on the host from which it draws all of its sustenance. The host is the entire universe of the parasite; he knows nothing beyond it, and desires to know nothing beyo nd it. Geoffrey LaPage writes in “Parasitic Animals”, “Some species of par asitic animals are among the most powerful enemies of man and his civilizati on.” He posits a Law of Nature – that the parasite is always smaller and we aker than its host, and that the parasite always disguises itself and its aim in order to carry out its parasitic mission. LaPage says, “The struggle between host a nd parasite went on according to the laws of evolution, and this battle is constantly being waged today.” LaPage notes that the parasite can cause biological change, citing particular species which cause changes in the host’ s reproductive glands. The parasite sometimes castrates the host in order to w eaken it, such as the parasitic crustacean Sacculina, which destroys the reproductive organs of its host, the short-tailed spider crab, Inacus Mautitan icus. We see the identical process today in which the hegemony of parasitism s eeks to alter the reproductive process of the host by converting the younger generation to unisex and homosexuality, and to render ineffective distinctive sexual characteristics of male and female. This is a clas sic instance of castration by the parasite."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"The natural World Order, which is based upon the ir revocable laws of the universe, has been temporarily replaced on Eart h by the unnatural World Order of the parasite. All of the programs and ene rgies of the parasite are devoted to a single goal, maintaining his feeding p osition upon the host. Freudian psychology was developed by the parasitic order to neutralize the incessant efforts of the host to throw off or dislo dge the parasite. Any move to dislodge the parasite is denounced as “reactiona ry”. It is defined and outlawed as an act of aggression, hostility, and al ienation. In fact, the host is merely trying to survive by throwing off the parasi te. Another law of nature is that the parasite, not only by sucking off the life sustenance of the host, but also by altering its life cycle, will inevitably ki ll the host. This process is called “the decline and fall of civilization”. LaPage notes that a parasite is not a particular sp ecies, but one which has adopted a certain way of life, the way of the p arasite. Whether or not it is a virus, the parasite has a viral effect on the hos t, slowly poisoning and destroying it. Viruses are classic parasites. The spirochete, virus of syphilis, is a classic parasitic organism. In biological parlan ce, a collection of spirochetes is known as a “Congress”. The U.S. Congress has specifically chartered many p arasitic functions in the philanthropic foundations. These groups now do minate educational and governmental institutions, laying down financial an d social goals which are designed solely to maintain the hegemony of parasit ism through its World Order. The American foundations are not even run b y Americans; their policies are formulated in London by the financiers and transmitted to this country through the British Army Bureau of Psycholo gical Warfare front Tavistock Institute. This is a typical disguised p arasitic operation. Censorship and observance of its biological taboos are the basis of the tribal rule of parasitism. The most stringent tabo o, one which has never been violated, is the taboo against any mention of paras itism as a force or power in society. No newspaper, magazine, radio or televisi on program, or school or"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"university course has ever been allowed to mention the societal impact of parasitism ! It is the greatest and most universal taboo in the world today. Michael Voslensky’s “NOMENKLATURA, The Soviet Elite ” identifies the Communist “new class” as a parasitic group. In rev iewing this work in FORTUNE Oct 15, 1984, Daniel Seligman notes, “Vosle nsky’s portrait leaves us thinking that the Nomenklatura is an entirely pa rasitic operation. Its interests are clearly not those of most Soviet citi zens.” The same observation can be made of the World Order’s ruling group in an y nation today, and particularly in the United States. Despite its present hegemony, the World Order of pa rasitism realizes that it is always subject to being dislodged, which , in effect, would mean its destruction. Therefore, it is necessary to control not only the channels of communication of the host, but his very thought pro cesses as well; to maintain constant vigilance that the host does not develop any concept of the danger of his situation, or any power to throw off the parasite. Therefore, the parasite carefully instructs the host that he exist s only because of the “benign” presence of the parasite – that he owes everything to the presence of the parasite, his religion, his social order, his monet ary system, and his educational svstem. The parasite deliberately inculcates in th e host the fear that if the parasite happens to be dislodged, the host will los e all these things, and be left with nothing. Although the World Order has control of the legal s ystem and the courts, it remains vulnerable to any enforcement of the pre-existing body of law which the host had formulated to protect his so ciety. This body of law forbids everything that the parasite is doing, and forces the parasite to maintain a precarious existence outside of the law. It the law were to be enforced at any time, the parasite would be dislodg ed. The existing body of law clearly forbids the operation of criminal syndi cates, which is precisely what the hegemony of parasitism and its World Order is. Criminal"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"syndicalism denies the equal protection of the law to citizens. Only by acting against criminal syndicalism can the state protect its citizens. Corpus Juris Secundum 16: Constitutional Law 213 ( 10) states : “The Constitutional guaranty of freedom of speech does n ot include the right to advocate, or conspire to effect, the violent destru ction or overthrow of the government or the criminal destruction of property. 214 : The Constitutional guaranty of the right of assembly was never intende d as a license for illegality or invitation for fraud – the right of freedom of a ssembly may be abused by using assembly to incite violence and crime, and th e people through their legislatures may protect themselves against the abu se.” The assembly of any World Order organization, such as the Council on Foreign Relations or any foundation, is subject to the laws against fraud (their charters claim they are engaged in philanthropy), a nd enforcement of the laws against criminal syndicalism would end the institut ions through which the World Order illegally rules the people of the Unite d States, the illegal conspiracies and the introduction of alien laws int o our system by the foundations instructions to Congress. We have already shown that the Rockefeller Foundati on and other key organizations of the World Order are “Syndicates”, which are engaged in the practice of criminal syndicalism. But what is a “s yndicate”? The Oxford English Dictionary notes that the word stems from “ syndic”. A syndic is defined as “an officer of government, a chief magis trate, a deputy”. In 1601 R. Johnson wrote in Kingd and commonw “especiall me n, called Syndiques, who have the managing of the whole commonwealth.” Thus the Rockefeller Foundation and its associated groups are carrying o ut their delegated function of managing the entire commonwealth, but not for th e benefit of the people, or of any government except the secret super-govern ment, the World Order, which they serve. The OED further defines a syndic as “a censor of the actions of another. To accuse.” Here too, the syn dicate functions acording to its definition – the syndicate censors all thought and media, primarily to"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"protect its own power. It also brings accusations – as many American citizens have found to their sorrow. Not even Sir Walter Ra leigh was immune. When he interfered with the international money trade, h e was accused of “treason” and beheaded. The OED defines a “syndicate” as follows : “3. A c ombination of capitalists and financiers entered into for the pur pose of prosecuting a scheme requiring large sources of capital, especially one having the object of obtaining control of the market in a particular commodity. T o control, manage or effect by a syndicate.” Note the key words in this defini tion – a combination – prosecuting – obtaining control. The scheme does n ot require “large capital” – it requires “large sources of capital”, the bank of England or the Federal Reserve System. Corpus Juris Secundum 22A says of Criminal Syndical ism, “In a prosecution for being a member of an organization w hich teaches and abets criminal syndicalism, evidences of crimes committed by past or present members of the organization in their capacity as me mbers is admissible to show its character.” People v. LaRue 216 P 627 C.A . 276. Thus testimony about John Foster Dulles financing the Nazi Governm ent of Germany, his telegram starting the Korean War, and other evidenc e can be used to indict any member of the Rockefeller Foundation in any sta te or locality in which the Rockefeller Foundation has ever been active in any way. Since these organizations are all closely interlocked, and ther e is so much available evidence of their illegal operations, it will be re latively simple to obtain criminal convictions against them for their crimina l syndicalist operations. Corpus Juris Secundum 22, Criminal Law 185 (10); C onspiracy and Monopolies : “Where the statute makes mere members hip in an organization formed to promote syndicalism a crime, without an o vert act, this offense is indictable in any county into which a member may go during the continuance of his membership, and this is true although such m ember comes into a county involuntarily.

Criminal syndicalism can also be prosecuted accordi ng to Corpus Juris Secundum 46, Insurrection and Sedition : sec. 461 c. “Sabotage and syndicalism aiming to abolish the present political and social system, including direct action or sabotage.” Thus any program of a foundation which seeks to abolish the present political or social system of t he United States can be prosecuted.

They constantly intensify all problems through the found ations, so that political and economic crises prevent the peoples of the world fr om organizing against them. The World Order must paralyze its opponents. They terrorize the world with propaganda about approaching internation al nuclear war, although atomic bombs have been used only once, in 1945, whe n the Rockefeller Foundation director Karl T.

Because of the billions of lives which have been bl ighted and destroyed by the conspiracies of the World Order through its hegemony of parasitism, vengeance for these atrocities demands the most tho roughgoing and relentless retribution against the criminal syndicalists. The ir record is clear. In 1984, as these words are written, we are observi ng the Year of 1984. George Orwell’s book, written in 1949, was thought to be only a warning against what was to come. It was not a warning. “ 1984” is the Program ! Orwell, a lifelong Socialist, fought for many days in the front lines for the Communists in Spain. He was wounded, but this did not lessen his dedication to the goals of World Socialism. The most practica l way to achieve these goals was to formulate the program, as Col. House h ad done in “Philip Dru, Administrator”. Orwell laid down the dictum that s logans must be in Newspeak, “War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignora nce is Strength”. This is the program of the hegemony of parasitism through t he World Order. Orwell posited three superstates, Eurasia, Oceania, and Ea stasia, “permanently at war in one combination or another”. He continues, “War , however, is no longer the desperate annihilating struggle that it was in the early decades of the 20th century. It is a warfare of limited aims, between combatants who are unable"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"to destroy one another, have no material cause for fighting, and are not divided by an genuine ideological difference ....

The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principle of doublethink, the a im is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directing brai ns of the Party) is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living .... the essential act of war is destruction, not n ecessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labor. The two aims of the p arty are to conquer the whole surface of the earth and to extinguish once a nd for all the possibility of independent thought.” Orwell concludes “1984” with a denial that the vict ims of the World Order have any hope. He claims the World Order wil l always triumph, which is a great propaganda achievement for the hegemony of parasitism. He writes, “If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boo t stamping on a human face – forever.” He disposes of his “hero”, a citizen w ho had vainly tried to oppose the Party, by ending the book with the “hero ” whimpering that “He loved Big Brother”. The peoples of the world not only will never love B ig Brother, but they will soon dispose of him forever. To maintain the present hegemony of parasitism, the World Order program for the future, as drawn up by the foundati ons, is as follows : Small wars from 1985 to 1990. Global war from 1990-2000. The gradual annihilation of the populations of the United State s, Canada and Western Europe.

The few survivors will be allowed to revert to their pr imitive conditions, which will reduce their numbers even further.
