[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Introduction O NE MIGHT ask today, years after the fall of the Berlin Wall: \"Why would anyone want to re ad a report by a communist about the revolutionary takeove r of Czechoslovakia — a coun- try that no longer ex ists? The Czechs are capitalists now, re- member?\" Such a question reveals a numb er of erroneous assumptions that this document convincingly refutes — not the least of which is the false assumption that the leaders of the former Communist states of Eastern Europe were wedded to ideology. As Jan Kozak and 40 years of br utal Communist Party rule in Czechoslovakia so clearly demonstrate, communism was a tac- tic employed for the assumption of power, rather than a sin- cere belief. These same tactics, modified only slightly, are being used today. Americans who labor under the false premise that communism is either an ideology or a system of econom- ics that died with the Cold War do so at their personal and na- tional peril. Most Americans are falsely conditioned to believe today that elective governments are perman ently established and practi- cally invincible to destruction, so long as elections are free from fraud and consumers can buy Big Mac hamburgers in the market. And Not a Shot Is Fire d authoritatively disproves that myth. This document is a \"how -to\" manual for totalitarian takeover of an elected parliamentary system of government through mainly legal and consti tutional means. Kozak did not pontificate fuzzy theories of how \"revolutionary parliamentarianism\" might be accomplished. He wrote from personal experience and intimate knowledge of how this sei- zure of power actually was accomplished.

More on that, after a little background. Origin of the Document And Not A Shot Is Fired only accidentally made it into the public domain. Written between 1950 and 1955 (and revised somewhat after that) as an in ternal Czechoslovak Communist Party strategy paper, the two ch apters which co mprise this document were discussed briefly by Communist Czechoslovak delegates to the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) in London in the fall of 1957. Kozak was a member of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committ ee, briefly a member of the government secretariat, and late r, official historian for the Czechoslovak Communist Party. A copy of these two chapters, officially entitled How Parliame nt Can Play a Revolutionary Part in the Transition to Socia lism and The Role of the Popu- lar Masses, were requested through IPU channels by British delegates to the conf erence. The word ca me back from the Czechoslovaks that the just-pub lished manuscript was myste- riously \"out of print.\" It wa s not until Janua ry of 1961 that, according to the original British publishers, \"by a mere coinci- dence, a copy of the report was secured.\" 1 Once received, Kozak's manife sto was quickly translated into English and published in February of that year by London's Independent Research Centre under a combination of the titles Kozak had given them: How Parliament Can Play a Revolutionary Part in the Transition to Socialism and the Role of the Popular Masses. The document became an instant international sensation, and by the beginning of 1962 Kozak's manual was being widely distri buted in seve ral languages ii"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"throughout Europe and the United States. Radio Free Europe (RFE) published its own English tr anslation under the original title, and a committee of Congres s reproduced and distributed the RFE translation as well.

But most Americans who came to know Jan Kozak and his step-by-step program for a totali tarian takeover of a free gov- ernment read the book under the title And Not A Shot Is Fired, under which the Connecticut-based Long House publishers dis- tributed the original British tr anslation of Kozak's manual. The title of the popular American ed ition came straight out of the superb introduction by John Ho wland Snow. Snow explained that Kozak's document is a blue print of how a \"representative government can be made authoritarian, legally, piece by piece. The form remains, an empty she ll.... And not a shot is fired.\" 2 Americans with only a little knowledge of post-war Europe are under the illusion that after th e defeat of Hitler, Stalin in- stalled his lackeys in Eastern European governments solely by force of the Soviet Army. This was not the case. Stalin had to pledge at least the appearance of free elections at Yalta, even if the concessions granted by Frank lin D. Roosevelt guaranteed the eventual absorption of Easter n Europe into St alin's orbit. Eastern Europe actually enjoyed a short period of relative free- dom after the war, during 1946 and 1947, when there were more or less free elections. Mo st of the Soviet -occupied coun- tries elected non-communist majori ties, despite severe harass- ment of non-communist parties during the election campaigns.

There was nothing original in the strate gies and tactics for taking over free governments outlined by Ko zak, although many Ameri- cans in the 1960s — even among those who thought they were well informed — regarded Koza k's blueprint as new tactics and ideology. In fact, most of what Kozak describes had been theorized a generation earlier by Italian Communist Party chief Antonio Gramsci. But only Kozak has demonstrated how such a takeover actually was accomplishe d. And Not A Shot Is Fired has enduring value fo r several reasons, not the least of which is that the brief treatise is sufficiently straightforward — and comparatively free of communistic dialectical jargon — that it can be profitably read by the casual reader. That the document was written in a form readily comprehensible by the lay reader can only be chalked up to Co mmunist overconfi dence in the inevitable ascendancy of their empire. Kozak boasted that the Communist empire \"comprises over 25 per cent of the whole world; 35 per cent of the world's population lives in it and about 30 per cent of the world's indus trial output is produced by it.\" (Page 1) To be sure, Jan Kozak prolifically used com- munistic patois throughout th e manual, drawing from a lexi- con that has been alterna tively termed \"dialectics,\" \"wordsmanship,\" and \"Aesopea n language.\" And the docu- ment can be read much more pr ofitably with a thorough knowl- edge of the Communist Party's dial ectic of that time frame. But Kozak's manuscript is one of those rare specimens of totalitar- ian literature where the main thrust of the document is under- standable on its face even without that knowledge.

Kozak was no dreamy-eyed professor embracing a nebu- lous idea of a future socialist Utopia; he and his confederates were reality-hardened schemers who would use any method available to gain as much power as possible. To power-hungry conspirators like Kozak, Comm unist ideology was mainly a useful cover for the organizational undertaking of a coup d'etat — a tactic, not a belief system . The Communists actually dis- dained other socialists, such as social democrats, even though they constantly strove to coalesce with and co-opt these demo- cratic parties. Co-opting Ideological Language The Communists adapted the lang uage of socialist ideology and the political policies of soci alist regimes for their own in- ternal use on several fronts. Many socialist terms were given double meanings — sometimes called \"dialec tics\" — among Communist revolutionaries for fu rtherance of their coup. Thus, terms like \"proletariat\" and \"w orker's class\" can have their plain meaning or be code word s for \"Communist Party lead- ers.\" Or, \"people's interest/' \"d emocratic will of the masses\" and \"decision of the proletariat\" could have its ordinary mean- ing or designate \"orders from Party leadership.\" The use of dialectic meaning in words was and remains a necessary part of any plan to overthrow free governments. Out- right announcement of the goals and motivations of revolution- aries would arouse too much alarm among the people and create too much resistance, resu lting in the defeat of the con- spirators. The use of such do uble-meaning terms serves as a means of transmitting, indirectly, an action program to fellow conspirators without alarming the general populace. If con- fronted with the true dialectical meaning of the terms, conspira- tors can simply claim that it is merely id eological belief, and vi"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"that the accuser is simply a paranoid who is falsely reading sin- ister motivations into th e revolution ary's words. Dialectical speech was not unique to Kozak's Czechoslovak branch of the Communist Party, nor has it been limited to Com- munism. Mafiosi and other criminal gangs typically have their own language that serves both as verbal handshakes and to communicate without at tracting the notice of the law. And like the lingo of gangsters, Communi st dialectics changes fre- quently in order to preserve it s esoteric qualitie s. (Few would think that \"wise guys\" today would utilize an tiquated terms such as \"rubbed out,\" \"greased ,\" or \"squeezed\" anymore, be- cause they have long been in the common parlance.) In Communist history, dialectical \"code-speech\" goes all the way back to the begi nning. As far back as 1848, when Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels completed The Communist Mani- festo, it was widely condemned as being a conspiratorial docu- ment. Few literate men then to ok seriously Marx and Engels' preposterous claim that the government-power grab which comprised the ten-plank platform in The Communist Manifesto would lead to what the two late r promised as the \"withering away\" of the state. 3 To claim that the state withers away when you give it more power requires profound stupidity or brazen dishonesty. And, by all accounts, Marx and Engels were not stupid. The Communist Manifesto, like Kozak's manuscript, is simply a manual of how to take control of a government, the latter having laid out the sche me in both more openly brazen terms and greater mechanical detail.

Con- centration of power in the hands of a few government leaders makes the state easier to seize by a determined conspiracy. To conspirators, socialism serves as a control-the-wealth program, not a share-the-wealth program. Thus, none should be surprised that Hitler and Mussolini took ov er freely-elected parliaments in their countries — legally and constitutionally, as Kozak and his co-conspirators later accomplished — only after posing as socialist ideologues of one form or another. Some may contest the assertio n that Hitler and Mussolini arose out of socialism because of popular notion s that these dictators stem from the \"right\" wing of the ideological spec- trum. Such illusions have no basis in fact. The very name \"Nazi\" was almost never used by the Nazis themselves; it was merely an acronym for Hitler's \"National Socialist Party\" which created such socialist inst itutions as the government au- tomobile industry. (Volkswagen, wh ich originated as a govern- ment program und er the Hitler regime, means \"people's car\" in German.) And Mussolini's deep socialist roots date back to before World War I, with his ed itorship of the socialist news- paper, Avanti! From a power po litics perspective Mussolini's fascism, after being imposed upon Italy, differed only superfi- cially with outright socialis m. Mussolini had completely adopted the notion that government should be fully involved in controlling property, even if he did allow nominal private ownership. Il Duce's program that the stat e would be the \"su- preme regulator of the relation s between all citizens of the state\" 4 fits hand-in-glove with the political program instituted by Kozak and his co-conspirators after they had taken power for themselves.

And fascism is the economic program increasingly being followed in the United States and the form erly socialist nations of East- ern Europe today. Economic fa scism offers a number of ad- vantages for the modern conspi rator over the socialism used by Kozak — but only because fascism is typically called some other nebulous name such as \"T hird Way\" or \"public-private partnership,\" or (even worse) fa lsely represented as \"privatiza- tion,\" or \"free trade,\" or \"free enterprise.\" The fascist economic model does not carry all the public relations baggage of Stalinist socialism, and, over the short term at least, it can be more economically efficient than outright socialism.* Thus, it should be no surprise that the same conspirators who ran the governments of former Soviet \"R epublics\" of Eastern Europe have readily exchanged their Co mmunist Party posts for \"elec- tive\" posts, or that the brand of state control they are now push- ing is called \"privatizati on\" and \"economic reform.\" Pressure from Above, Pressure from Below A socialist or fascist economic policy is necessary for dicta- torial revolution in an electi ve government — and not simply because socialism or fascism co ncentrates the physical power of the state in the few who run the executive branch of govern- ment.

Kozak uses an excellent example in this text of the hegemonic leadership manufactured by th e Communists over agriculture in Czechoslovakia. Farmers and ranchers have traditionally been very conservative, indepe ndent, and resistant to tyranny. In a heavily agricultural state such as war-devastated Czecho- slovakia, farmers and ranchers would have been a strong counter-revolutionary force. In deed, Stalin had found fanners to be the chief anti-totalitarian force in pre-war Ukraine. But in Czechoslovakia, Communi st cadres \"from below\" in- filtrated and co-opted the conser vative leadership of the agri- cultural interests, giving the mi sleading impression that farmers were divided on the revolution — or perhaps even supportive of it. Meanwhile, \"parliamentary socialism\" -— the \"pressure from above\" — used the power of the state, under the pretext of yielding to pressure from \"farmers\" (represented by these Communist infiltrators) to br eak up the econom ic base and strength of the independent farmers. As the preceding example illust rates, Kozak outlined the main thesis of a giant pincer's strategy for transforming a par- liamentary system of government into a totalitarian dictator- ship — the strategy of combining \"pressure from above\" with \"pressure from below\" to effect revolutionary change. In es- sence, under this plan, the Communist minority in parliament (in coalition with socialist parties) serves the revolution by ini- tiating policies and legislati on which strengthen the hand of grassroots revolutionaries and pun ish threats to the coup (i.e., the Right). Meanwhile, grassroot s revolutionaries whip up the X"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"appearance of popular support fo r the legislative program to advance the revolution throu gh strikes, rallies, petitions, threats, and — sometimes — sabotage. The \"pressure from be- low\" by the small number of revo lutionaries and their larger number of dupes is then used to \"justify\" the cen tralization of power in the hands of the executiv e branch of the state. Wishy- washy politicians ar e intimidated, and the \"pressure from above\" intensifies. Each legisl ative victory resu lts in new de- mands (the \"pressure from below\") for even stronger legisla- tion, which is relentlessly pursued by communi sts and their dupes in parliament — who claim, of course, that they are act- ing in the name of the popular will. The cycle continues until opposition is completely powerle ss, intimidated, or liquidated — and the revolution is a fait accompli. The theory for using \"pressure from above\" and \"pressure from below\" in order to acqui re power, explained in this manual by Kozak, first emerged in the writings of an obscure Italian Communist thinker name d Antonio Gramsci. Gramsci had plenty of time for contempl ating the reasons why his Com- munist Party had lost Italy to Be nito Mussolini, since he spent the last years of his life in Mussolini's jails. Gramsci concluded that in order to capture the power in a state, one must first cap- ture the culture. By culture, Gramsci meant the powerful non- governmental institutions of gr eat influence throughout the nation, specifically: churches, unions, mass me dia, political parties, universities and educat ional centers, business organi- zations, foundations, etc. Gramsci explained that, in hindsight, it was unreasonable to expect the Communists to have seized power in pre-World War II Italy in the same way that the Oc- tober Revolution had succeeded in Russia. \"In [totalitarian, Tsarist] Russia the state was everything,\" Gramsci explained in his Prison Notebooks. \"[C] ivil society was primordial and XI"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"gelatinous; in the West, there was a proper relation between state and civil societ y, and when the stat e trembled a sturdy structure of civil societ y was at once revealed.\" 5 In the West, Gramsci explaine d, family loyalti es, faith in God, and lawful limits on governmental power were thor- oughly represented in the cultural institutions. Gramsci wrote that \"there can and must be a 'political hegemony' even before assuming government power, and in order to exercise political leadership or hegemony one must not count solely on the power and material force th at is given by government.\" 6 Gramsci argued that without a su ccessful \"war of position\" for \"cultural hegemony\" (cultural le adership) within these institu- tions, a revolutionary power grab — even by a well-organized conspiracy — is impossible. Ultimately, the Italian Commu- nists were outmaneuvered in th e cultural war by Mussolini's blackshirts. Belief in God, fa mily, and limited government in the developed nations of the West constitutes a cultural system of \"fortresses and earthworks\" against revolution, according to Gramsci. A coup d'etat, without having first subverted these \"fortresses and earthw orks\" through the ac quisition of politi- cal/cultural hegemony, would only be temporary and result in a quick and successful counter re volution. The revolutionaries of today are well aware that thei r struggle for control of the culture cannot be won overnight. Gramsci follower and Frank- fort school of socialism apostl e Rudi Dutschke explained the Gramscian struggle as a \"long march through the institutions\" 7 to win Gramsci's \"war of position\" over any cultural institu- tions which would stand in the wa y of a coup d'et at by a con- spiratorial faction. To revolutionaries like Kozak and Gramsci, all cultural and governmental institutions constitute battlefields. Kozak ex- plained that the Czech Communist Party created \"mass organi- xii"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"zations\" to form that pressure from below, and used the power of the state to take over, elimin ate or isolate th e old conserva- tive institutions: \"[T]he 'pressure from above' was applied in an ever-increasing measure for the direct suppression and de- struction of the counter-revolutionary machinations of the bourgeoisie [the middle class] . Let us recall the signal role played in the development and extension of that pressure by the Ministry of the Interior, for instance, which was led by the Communists and the units of the State Security directed by them.\" (Page 13) As the stat e passed draconian gun control laws throughout Eastern European countries in the aftermath of World War II, the Communist Party armed itself and — to- gether with its control of th e police organs of government — obtained a monopoly on force in these nations. \"T he necessity of arming the most mature part of the workers' class for re- pulsing the counter-revolutionary machinations of the bour- geoisie ... has been proved, in cidentally, again by the later formation of the workers' militias in peoples' democratic Hun- gary and Poland,\" Ko zak emphasized. (Page 25) That victori- ous revolutionaries would ne ed a monopoly on force to consolidate control of a country is an obvious necessity, and it highlights our Second Amendment- protected right to keep and bear arms as an obvious \"earthwork\" against revolution. But in Czechoslovakia, it shoul d be emphasized, the monopoly on force mainly served a more subtle purpose than a violent over- throw; it created a helpless feel ing among the increasingly iso- lated non-communist opposition. Th e clash of arms was never necessary.

Both the U.S. government and the United Na- tions (as well as tax-exempt foundations) fund private organi- zations such as Planned Parenthood that perform abortions and distribute birth cont rol devices. At the sa me time, these orga- nizations lobby governments and create the appearance of popular support for government-subsidized abortion on de- mand and (eventually) coercive population-control programs. The United Nations uses a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) caucus of left-wing organi zations to create grassroots (pressure from below) to justify its authoritarian agenda, which (on the population-control front) includes supp ort for China's population-control program of fo rced abortion. The NGOs, of course, by no means represent the grassroots. But that does not prevent the movers and shaker s at the top — including the foundation heads and governmental officials who lavishly fund them — from representing them as such. There are dozens of other modern examples of how the \"pressure from above\" has created and funded the \"pressure from below,\" from the envi- ronmentalist movement to the in ternational gun control move- ment, the details of whic h could fill many pages. The U.S. Constitution — a formidable \"earthwork\" The U.S. Constitution — by way of contrast with parliamen- tary socialism/fascism — offers a formidable series of barriers to would-be dictators, with its separation of powers, system of checks and balances, reserved rights, delegated powers, and xiv"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"free enterprise-based econom y.

To a large extent, many of our cultural and governmental institutions have alre ady been captured by forces in favor of the centralization of governme nt power and, opposed to lim- ited government and the traditio nal morality of the churches. Few Americans are even aware that an invasion of our institu- tions has been ongoing — or that the invaders have won sev- eral engagements. Author and political comment ator John T.

It will probably have no marching songs. It will rise out of a congealing of a group of elements that exist here and th at are the essential components of Fascism.... It will be at firs t decorous, humane , glowing with homely American sentiment.\" 9 Several of the constitutional \"fortresses and earthworks\" which the Founding Fathers threw up to block revolution in our c onstitutional system have given way to decay in recent decades. The marginalization of gun ownership through federal legisl ation, the progressive lack of respect for the federal system of states rights by both political parties, and the assa ult on free speech ri ghts protected by the First Amendment through so-called \"campaign finance reform\" are but a few of many exampl es.

V. I. Lenin, in particular, illuminated this serious question thoroughly and systematically. In his life- time the proletarian revolution became an immediate question of the day. In his theoretical works and concretely in his prac- tical activity he started from the pr inciple that the forms of tran- sition to socialism are dependent on the concrete balance of international and internal class forces, on the degree of organi- zation of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, on the ability to gain allies, the level of the economic structure and on the po- litical traditions and form s of the organizations. From the moment the Great Socialist October Revolution broke the chains of imperialis m and gave powe r to the rela- tively weak proletariat of the na tions of backward Russia, pro- found objective and subjective changes began to take place in the world. The present fruit of the So cialist October Revolution is the new historical era, the characteris tic feature of which lies in the origin and consolid ation of the socialist global constellation. This constellation now embraces 17 countries, with the USSR and China at its head; it comprises over 25 per cent of the whole world; 35 per cent of the world's populati on lives in it and about 30 per cent of the world's industrial output is produced by it. 1"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The second characteristic feature of this new historical era is the collapse of the colonial system as a world factor. Impor- tant Asian and African countries such as India, Indonesia, Burma, Egypt and others have cast off the shackles of imperi- alism.

Both these main characteristics of the new historical era — the origin of the socialist conste llation and the collapse of the colonial system — have pr ofoundly changed the objective structure of the world. Thes e profound changes in the objec- tive structure of the world are necessarily accompanied also by profound subjective changes — cha nges in the thinking, views, political and practical orientati on of the broad popular masses. The aggravated confli cts in the weakened capitalist constella- tion compel the imperialists to resort to harsher oppression, ex- ploitation, suppression of natio nal rights, interference with democracy and preparations for a new war. By this, however, they cause broader and broader oppressed and di ssatisfied so- cial sections to rally against them, sections which are fighting against national suppression, for democracy and peace. In this struggle for national and democratic intere sts, the individual trends and currents of the anti -imperialist ba ttle are forming their ranks. These trends, which are the result and the product of the new subjective processes in society, are, however, dis- persed, isolated and constantly weakened by the propaganda of the ruling bourgeoisie and by the ideology and practice of reformism. In a number of capitalist and de pendent coun- tries there still slumbers the enormous, but still dispersed force of the broad popular masses. In this situation the workers' class in these countries is faced with the task of firmly taking a stand at the he ad of the struggle for the na- 2"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"tional and democratic interests of its respective nations, of uniting in its fight for socialism and of creating, under its leadership, a united and migh ty anti-imperialist popular movement. The new historical era and its tasks have created most favor- able conditions for the workers' class in this way for gaining new allies. The old tenets about the allies of the workers' class which corresponded to old historical cond itions are undergo- ing a change and are widening. Along with the changed condi- tions for the struggle for na tional democratic and peace interests, the conditi ons for the struggle of the workers' class for socialism are also changing. In the fight against imperial- ism, which endeavors to overcom e its conflicts by completely ignoring the interests of the nati ons and which strives to liqui- date their independence as states , the national role of the work- ers' class is growing and it is placed in the forefront of all patriotic and democratic forces. Patriotism: A Difficulty for the Proletarian Revolution \"Patriotism,\" V. I. Lenin proc laimed, \"is one of the deepest feelings firmly rooted in the hearts of peopl e for hundreds and thousands of years from the mome nt their separate fatherlands began to exist. It has been one of the greatest, one can say ex- ceptional, difficulties of our proletarian re volution that it had to pass through a period of sharpe st conflict with patriotism during the time of the Brest- Litovsk peace.\" (V. I. Lenin, \"Spisy\" Vol. 28, Czech edition, 1955, p. 187.) It is a great, one may say ex ceptionally favorable, circum- stance for the socialist revolutio n in the present situation that patriotism, \"one of the feelings most deeply rooted in people,\" leans on and needs socialism in the struggle against imperial- ism for national interests.

Parliament as \"an instrument... of the socialist revolution\" The new conditions which are th e consequence of the pro- found objective and subjective changes in the world create also new opportunities and prospects for the socialis t revolution, new avenues as far as the forms of transition to socialism are concerned. In a numb er of countries whic h are particularly weakened by the conflicts within the capitalist order, the op- portunity has arisen for the worker s' class to place itself firmly at the head of great popular movements for national indepen- dence, democracy, peace and socialism, to defeat the reaction- ary anti-people forces strivi ng for the maintenance and aggravation of national oppressi on and exploitation, to win a decisive majority in parliament and to change it from an organ of the bourgeois democracy into an organ of power for the de- mocracy of working people, into a direct instrument of power for the peaceful development of the socialist revolution. Also, our experience provides notable and practical proof that it is possible to transform parliament from an instrument of the bourgeoisie into an inst rument of the revolutionary democratic will of the people and into an instrument for the development of the socialist revolution. When the German imperialist occupiers, aided by the treach- erous bourgeoisie at home and with the consent of the Western imperialist powers, destroyed the national liberty and the inde- pendence of the Czechoslovak republic in 1938 and 1939, the Communist Party of Czechosl ovakia (hereinafter CPCS) placed itself at the head of the st ruggle for nati onal liberation by the Czech and Slovak people. Following up the policy of 4"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"the Popular Front originating fro m the time of the defense of the republic against fascism at ho me and abroad, it formed, in the course of a heavy fight against the occupiers requiring many sacrifices, a broad National Front, in which stood, under the leadership of the workers' cl ass, and side by side with it, peasants, tradesmen, the intellig entsia, and part of the Czech and Slovak bourgeoisie. This broad National Front, embracing all patriotic and democratic forc es of the coun try, was led by the working class into the national and de mocratic revolution. Thanks to the fact that Hitl er's Germany was crushed by the armies of the Soviet Union and that our countr y was directly liberated by the Soviet army, th at national and democratic revo- lution conquered. As a consequence the occupation power of the German imperialists and of their domestic helpmates — the treacherous financial, industrial and agrari an upper bourgeoi- sie — was swept away, national unity and independence as a state was revived and a deep-rea ching democratization of the country was carried out. Furtherm ore, the sovereignty and in- dependence of Czechoslovakia wa s renewed in the form of a new, people's democratic order. The Communist Party Consolidates Its Influence In this struggle the workers' class, led by the CPCS, became the recognized driving force of the nation; its action-unity was consolidated and the influence of reformism which had splin- tered it in the years of the pr e-Munich republic was weakened. The victory of the national a nd democratic revolution meant for the workers' class, which ha d relied in this struggle on all patriotic and democratic forces — the peasants, tradesmen, the intelligentsia and part of the Czech and Slovak bourgeoisie — its access to power The workers' class was the ma in force in the new revolu- 5"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"tionary democratic government (the so-called Kosice Govern- ment) and in the national committees — the new organs of the state's power created from below by the revolutionary masses. The program for the building of the liberated republic, which had been elaborated and s ubmitted by the Co mmunists and which became the program of the government, was quickly implemented by the revolutiona ry activity of the popular masses. Its implementa tion gave rise to fa r-reaching political, economic, social and cultural changes in the country. Of the political points in this program, these were the most important: the breaking up of the basic members of the old op- pressive bourgeois state appara tus and assumption of power by the national committees, the formation of a new people's secu- rity system and army, the prohibition of the revival of the po- litical parties whic h had represented th e treacherous upper bourgeoisie, a systematic pu rge of the entire political, eco- nomic and cultural life of the c ountry, the settleme nt of the re- lations between the Czech and Slovak nations on the principle of equality, the e xpulsion of the Ge rman minority, etc. Changing the Social Structure Of the economic measures, the following were the most im- portant: the transfer of all enemy property, of that of the treach- erous upper bourgeoisie and of ot her traitors, to the national administration of the new people's authority; the transfer of the land belonging to these enemies and traitors to the ownership of landless persons, tenant s and working smallholders. The principal foreign policy ta sk was unequivocal alliance with the Soviet Union, safeguard ing national liberty and inde- pendence as a state and further undisturbed, peaceful develop- ment for the nations of Czechoslovakia. All these measures, aiming at far-reaching changes in the so- 6"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"cial structure of the country, em anated directly from the condi- tions and tasks of the anti-fascist, national and democratic fight for liberation and arose from the old democratic traditions and longing of our people and they, furthermore, deepened and safeguarded that democracy. One of the tasks the Czechoslo- vak workers' class set itself in the struggle for the national and democratic interests of the people was, also, therefore, the re- establishment of the institution of Parliament which the occu- piers had abolished, aided by th e treacherous domestic upper bourgeoisie and traditions whic h had deep roots among the people. As early as the end of the summer of 1945, after agree- ment had been reached between the political pa rties forming the National Front, the Provisional National Assembly was elected (on the principle of pari ty representation ) and, in May 1946, the Constituent National Assembly in general, secret, di- rect and fair elections. The composition of Parliament was strongly influenced by the results of the revolution, by the prac- tical schooling of the wo rking masses in the course of the vic- torious revolution. Of the eight po litical parties which were part of the National Front of Czechs and Slovaks at the time of the elections, the Communist Party emerged as by far the stron- gest. It gained over 40 per cent of the vote s in the Czech lands and, with the Communist Party of Slovakia, 38 per cent of the votes cast in the state as a whole. Parliament and, along with it, the fight between the workers' class and the bourgeoisie about its role and content, entered the history of the people's demo- cratic development of Czechoslo vakia. The workers' class, whose struggle had made it poss ible that this institution could be re-established, st rove for Parliament, as one of the most prominent political traditions a nd forms of the past, to change its character (lit.: content; Tr.), to change it from an instrument of the workers' class into one of the levers actuating the fur- 7"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"ther development and consolidation of the revolution, into a di- rect instrument for the socialis t building of th e country. The bourgeoisie, on the other hand, strove for Parliament to be re- vised with its old content — bourgeois parliamentarianism — and tried to use it for the stopping of the revolution, for the demolition of its achievements, for the consolidation and wid- ening of its former political and economic power positions, for the preparation of the restoration of its former rule and dicta- torship. Parliament Provides \"Pressure From Above\" This struggle took place dur ing the period from 1946-1948. In the course of these years the workers' class, led by the Com- munists, made effective use of all its old forms of fighting, em- ployed by the revolutio nary workers' parties in Parliament, adjusted, however to the new conditions, and found new ones. Helped by Parliament, which wa s used by the workers' class for deepening the revolution and for the gradual, peaceful and bloodless change of the national and democratic revolution into a socialist one as \"pressure fro m above,\" and by its effect on the growth of the \"pressure fr om below,\" the bourgeoisie was pushed step by step from its sh are in the power. This gradual and bloodless driving of the bourgeoisie from power and the quite legitimate constitutional ex pansion of the power of the workers' class and of the working people was completed in February 1948 by the parliament ary settlement of the govern- ment crisis engineered by the b ourgeoisie. The scope of power was definitely settled in favor of the workers' class, and Par- liament, as one of the instrument s of its power, began to serve immediately the socialist transformation of the country. Parliament, which had played an important role in pre- Munich, capitalist Czechoslovak ia in the poli tical, economic, 8"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"cultural and social life of the country, which had awakened and created a number of bourgeois, democratic, parliamentary tra- ditions among broad sections of the population, underwent a change. The form remained but the content was different. Our working people, led by the Communists, provided practical proof during the years 1945-1948 that it was possible to trans- form parliament from an organ of the bourgeoisie into an in- strument developing democratic measures of consequence, leading to the gradual change of the social structure and into a direct instrument fo r the victory of the socialist revolution. From Capitalism to Socialis m — By Means of Parliament This fact, coupled with simila r experiences ga ined by the other Communist and workers' pa rties, led to the possibility being envisaged of the transition of some countries from capi- talism to socialism by revoluti onary use of parliament. This road which was most clearly illuminated and generalized at the 20th Congress of the CPSU shows, at the present time, the real possibility of forming a government of broad democratic forces grouped round the workers' class, relying on the revolutionary activity of the masses. Such a government can be set up with- out armed battle, by peaceful means. Its installation would be practically tantamount to the es tablishment of the democratic revolutionary power of the people. (Therefo re, about the same would be achieved, as was attained in our country, by the armed, bloody battle of the na tional and democratic revolu- tion.) The purpose to which this new pow er, the nucleus of which would be formed by the wo rkers' class, should be put thereafter would be the use of parliament for the consolidation and deepening of the real democr atic rights and to a more or less speedy unfolding of the social ist revolution (Generally our tasks during the years 1945-1948). The use of parliament itself 9"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"for the transfer of all power in to the hands of the workers' class, the speed of progress an d the order of it s revolutionary tasks, would be, however, the same as the methods of the struggle — variegated — and would always correspond with the specific class and historical conditions. Despite these differences ther e are in existence fundamen- tal, generally valid conditions for the possibility of a revolu- tionary use of parliament on the road to socialism, the substance of which is revolutionary and which are to be clearly distinguished from the reformist conception of the aim and use of Parliament. Our own Czechoslo vak experience has also con- tributed to the generalization and practical proof of the validity of these principles. The most important of these lies in the necessity of combin- ing the revolutionary activity of parliament with a systematic development and the organizati on of revolutionary actions on the part of broad popular masses. The Combination of \"Pressu re From Above\" and that \"From Below\" — One of the Elementary Conditions for the Revolutionary Use of Parliament. A preliminary condition for carry ing out fundamental social changes and for making it possible that parliament be made use of for the purpose of transfor ming a capitalist society into a socialist one, is: (a) to fight fo r a firm parliamentary majority which would ensure and develo p a strong pressure from \"above,\" and (b) to see to it that this firm parliamentary ma- jority should rely on the revolutionary acti vity of the broad working masses exerting pressure \"from below. \" The elemen- tary condition for success consists , therefore, of a combination 10"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"of pressure from \"above\" with th at from \"below\" and its joint effect on the unfolding and streng th of the revolution. This con- nection of the form of fightin g from \"above\" with that from \"below\" emanates from the prin ciple that questions regarding the class struggle (and, all the mo re, the social revolution) are decided and can be decided by st rength alone. The pressure from \"above\" is a combination of preparations of the condi- tions for the creation and organization of th e strength of the revolution, for its aggressiveness and its drive. Pressure From Above (a) Regarding Questions of Using Pressure from \"Above\" The possibility and necessity of using tactical pressure from above in the stage of the democratic revolution was empha- sized by the classics of Marxism-Leninism. In 1873, F. Engels criticized the Spanish nihilists (l it.: Bakuninists; Tr.) for not making use of pressure from above for the development of the democratic revolution. In 1905, V. I, Lenin proclaimed: 1. \"To restrict, as a princi ple, revolutionary actions to pressure from below and to forgo pressure from above, is anarchism. 2. \"Whoever cannot grasp the new tasks in the era of revo- lution, the tasks of actions , from above, whoever can- not state the conditions for and the program of such actions, that person has no idea of the tasks of the pro- letariat in any democratic revolution. 3. \"The principle that it is not admissible for social de- mocracy (i.e., the revolution ary party of the prole- tariat) to take part, jointl y with the bourgeoisie, in a provisional revolutionary government, that every such participation should rate as betrayal of the workers' 11"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"class, is a principle of anarchism.\" (V. I. Lenin, \"Spisy,\" Vol. 8, Czec h edition 1954. p. 477.) The Bolsheviks were to have participated in the en- visaged provisional revolu tionary government in the bourgeois democratic revolu tion in Russia in 1905, with this aim: to lead a heedless fight against all counter-revolutionary efforts and to protect the inde- pendent interests of the workers' class. The overall character of the participation in this government was: not to lose from sight, even for a moment, the carry- ing out of a complete socialist coup. Suppressing the Counter-revolution Pressure from \"above\" is, theref ore, the pressu re of a revo- lutionary government, parliame nt and the other organs of power in the state apparatus or its parts and it has, in substance, a dual effect — the direct suppression by power of the counter- revolution and its machinations and, at the same time, the ex- ertion of pressure on the citizens, inciting and organizing them for the struggle for a further development of the revolution. A most important lesson for the whole of the international workers' move- ment (and by this for our Party as well) was learned from the ex- perience gained during the era of the Popular Fron t in Spain and France. In particular, the example of Spain showed that as a result of the weakness of the Communi sts who did not stand at the head of the whole movement, the pressure fr om \"above\" was weakened. The Republican gover nment, whose leading force was the Liberals, refused to meet the demands of the Commu- nists who pressed for a purge of fascist generals from the army , so the army was preserved fo r the counter-revolution, the army which later became the ma in force of the victorious counter-revolutionary uprising. 12"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Our workers' class and the CP CS gained valuable experi- ence from the course of the struggle from \"above\" and the various forms of application in the new conditions. What were the principal forms of pressure \"from a bove\" applied in the period of the transfor mation of our nation al and democratic revolution into a socialist one? Step One: Isolati ng the Bourgeoisie The first direction given to the pressure \"from above,\" which our workers' class applied from its position of power in the or- gans and newly forming links of the apparatus of the people's democratic state, was a systema tic fight against enemies, trai- tors and collaborators. Gradua lly, as the national and demo- cratic revolution changed into a socialist one, the pressure \"from above\" was applied in an ever-increasing measure for the direct suppression and destruction of the counter-revolu- tionary machinations of the bourge oisie. Let us recall the sig- nal role played in the devel opment and extension of that pressure by the Ministry of the Interior, for instance, which was led by the Communists and the units of State Security directed by them. But also other organs of the st ate and of the state apparatus controlled by the Communists also served for the direct sup- pression of bourgeois sabotage an d obstructionism. So, for in- stance, the Ministry of Agriculture quickly completed, by means of so-called \"roving co mmissions\" (lit.: flying commis- sions; Tr.) the confiscation of th e land of enemie s and traitors, which had been sabotaged in the autumn of 1946 by the bour- geoisie. The national committees organized in autumn 1947 the \"Special Food Commissions\" which uncovered the hidden stores of landowners and kulaks and contributed gr eatly in this way to their isolation. In Decem ber 1947 organs of the Minis- 13"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"try of Internal Trade, controll ed by the Communists uncovered an extensive black market in the textile trade organized by the bourgeoisie, and liquidated, for a ll practical purposes, the pri- vate capitalist textil e wholesale business by the setti ng up of state textile distribution centers. The organs holding powers and the components of the state controlled by Communists, in this way, becam e unusually ef- fective levers for the defense of the revolutionary achievements of the people and for the furt her advancement of the revolu- tion. They made it possible to suppress directly bourgeois counter-revolutionary elements (to render harmless their sabo- tage and subversion). They made an outstanding contribution to the isolation of th e bourgeoisie. They gave impetus to the revolutionary determination a nd self-confidence of the work- ing masses. And so they form ed a mighty su pport and force furthering the revolution. Step Two: Popularizin g Revolutionary Demands The second prong of the pressure \"from above\" success- fully employed by our workers' class was the use made of the organs holding powers (the government, parliament, na- tional committees) for bringing about a wide popularization of revolutionary demands and slogans. So, for instance, the government approved the \"Progr am of Building\" elaborated by the Communists, which, in its substance, was a program for the further transformation of the democratic revolution into a socialist one. Its passage was of immense importance since the program of the next economic-political measures for advancing the revolution, elaborated by the Communists, became the program of the entir e government. This later en- abled the workers' class to uncov er all attempts made by the bourgeoisie at thwarting it as evidence of the anti-people, 14"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"treacherous policy of the bourgeoi sie and to isolate its po- litical exponents. At the same time, becaus e of the fact that revolutionary demands and r ecommendations were spon- sored directly by organs of the state, they gave an unusually effective incentive for the revolutionary initiative of the masses. Examples of the far-re aching results in closing the ranks of the working masses round the slogans of the Party were, e.g., the proposal of the Communists in the govern- ment recommending the intr oduction of the Millionaires' Levy, the draft proposals of th e Agricultural Laws elabo- rated by the Communist-controlled Ministry of Agriculture and submitted to the working peasants for comment, and other things. The fact that such demands and recommenda- tions emanated directly from th e highest state organs had a strong influence on th eir popularization and gave an excep- tionally strong impetus to th e revolutionary elan of the masses who pressed fo r their implementation. (So, e.g., the notice for the preliminary regi stration of all land exceeding 50 hectares, issued by the Mini stry of Agriculture in the course of the struggle for th e implementation of the third phase of the people's democrat ic land reform, had the effect of the working peasants in a ll villages realizing, when the registration was carried out, what land was beyond their reach and how much of it there was; of their visualizing the possibility of getting hold of it soon and, ther efore, the ef- fect of an increasingly more determined and decisive stand being taken in favor of carrying out the proposed reform.) This direction given to the pres sure \"from above ,\" therefore, served particularly the wide popularization of the demands and slogans of the policy of the Co mmunists designed for a speedy progress of the revolution. It se rved as a means for the revolu- tionary education and organi zation of the popular masses. 15"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Step Three: Nationalizing the Economy A particularly important and exceptionally effective way of the struggle \"from above\" lay in the utilization of economic political power positions, especially the nationalization of the banks, of banking, of key and big industries. The economic power positions of the workers' class, rep- resented by the na tionalized sector of the country's economy, were a mighty lever for the development of pres- sure \"from above.\" It made po ssible the suppre ssion and, to a considerable extent, the pa ralyzing of bourgeois counter- revolutionary intrigues aime d at economic decline and chaos. On the other hand, these positions also made possible the exerting of \"pressure\" on the citizens and broad masses of the working people. The fa st expansion of nationalized production and the resulting rise in the standard of living of working people presented exampl es in point showing the ad- vantages of a nationalized and, in its substa nce, working- class-controlled and -directed production; gave rise to revolutionary self-c onfidence and determination on the part of the working people and thus contributed to a still further isolation of the bourgeoisie. This method of pressure \"fro m above\" was, therefore, a mighty pillar and force of the progressing (lit .: deepening; Tr.) revolution. Step Four: Using Power to Silence Opposition The fourth direction given to the pressure \"from above\" ex- isted in the utilization of the or gans holding power for the di- rect uncovering of th e anti-people policy of the bourgeoisie, for the isolation of the reactiona ry bourgeois leadership of the other parties of the National Front. All organs vested with powers (the national committees, Par- 16"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"liament, the government) became pl aces for the wo rkers' class in which the anti-people policy of the bourgeoisie and of its parties was being uncovered. The Communists made use of these organs for sharp criticism levelled against the other par- ties and their representatives on the grounds of inconsistency and obstructionism regarding the fulfillment of the tasks ac- cepted in the program (in Parlia ment, for instance, the criticism and uncovering of the anti-people activity of the Ministry of Justice which was controlled by the National Socialist Party, the uncovering of the ob structionist inactivit y of the Ministry of Food, controlled by the rightist Social Democrat Majer, etc.). At the same time, these organs holding power were used for tabling further demands and proposals in favor of the work- ing people and, in th is way, the bourgeoisie and its minions were forced either to their accep tance or to an open showing of their anti-people's face. (How important for the isolation of the bourgeois leadership of the othe r parties of th e National Front was the proposal of the Millionair es' Levy alone, tabled in the government by the Communists in 1947 and at first rejected by its majority!) These disclosures were especially tilted at those parties which professed to be socialist by their name and slogans, particularly at the National Socialist Party and the right wing of the Social Democratic Party. Their lying slogans and bourgeois conception of socialism were uncovered by the hand of their conc rete activity with in the organs, and their \"socialist cloak\" was to rn from them before the eyes of the working people. All the basic forms and actions involving pressure \"from above\" employed by our workers' class in the years 1945-1948 conformed, in the new circumstance s, with the tasks allotted to the pressure \"from above\" as predicted by Lenin — a fight 17"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"without quarter agains t all counter-revolutionary attempts and the defense of the independent in terests of the working class. By using these methods this prin ciple was fulfilled in practice: not to lose sight for a single moment of the aim of a complete socialist overthrow. The individual forms and actions of the struggle \"from above\" carried out by our workers' class in the years 1945- 1948 meant making use of the posit ions held by the workers' class in the organs vested with powers, and in the entire state and economic apparatus for stre ngthening the pe ople's demo- cratic power, for weakening and isolating the bourgeoisie, for conquering its positions by the workers' class and for the con- solidation of the revolutionary democratic people's power in the dictatorship of the proletariat. These forms and actions of the struggle \"from above\" — al- ways serving the release, the mobilization and organization of the revolutionary forces of th e popular masses — greatly en- riched the tactical armament and experience of the international workers' movement. Our practice and successes in the struggle \"from above\" made a trenchant contribution to the generaliza tion of the ex- perience gained and toward outlining the possibilities of a revo- lutionary use of parliament dur ing the transition to socialism. Pressure From Below (b) Questions of Utilizing Pressure \"From Below\" To bring about a parliament which would cease to be a \"soft-soap factory \" and would become a revolutionary assem- bly of working people requires, however, a force constituting, maintaining, and actively assisting its revolutionary activity. This force, necessary for brea king the resistance of the reac- tionary bourgeoisie, exists in the pressure by the popular 18"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"masses \"from below.\" Whereas pr essure \"from above\" is the pressure exerted by the organs of the state and of the state ap- paratus for the direct suppre ssion, by power, of the counter- revolution which helps, at the sa me time, to rally and organize the popular masses for the fight fo r further progress of the revo- lution, pressure \"from below\" is the pressure exerted by the popular masses on the government, on parliament and on other organs holding power. This pres sure takes effect mainly in three directions: (a) it systematically supports the re volutionaries in the organs of power, enhances their stre ngth and makes up for numeri- cal weakness; (b) it has a direct effect on limiting the influence and positions of waverers and enemies standi ng in the path of the further progress of the revolution; (c) it awakens the forces of the people dormant for many years, their energy and self-confid ence; it breaks through the onerous circle of intimidation and spiritual te rror of the old institutions, the Church, etc. The pressure \"from below,\" the revolutionary emergence of the popular masses, is, ther efore, essential for the suc- cess of every revolution. In the February revolution in France in 1848 the provisional government, in which there were only two representatives of the workers, refused to de- clare the republic. However, it was forced to do so by the threat of the armed proletaria t. The pressure \"from below\" prompted the provisional gove rnment to ac t.

In 1936*, when the Seventh Co ngress of the Communist In- ternational elaborated the line of a united and popular front and the government po ssibilities of a united or popular front, the necessity of pressure brought to bear on such a government by the revolutionary masses was stressed: \"Since this movement of a united front is a militant movement against fascism and the reactionaries, it will be a constant movable force dr iving the government of the united front into the fight ag ainst the reactionary bour- geoisie . . .

Therefore, the revolutionary workers' moveme nt must bring pressure to bear from below on parliame nt and the government when- ever it wishes to protect, consolidate and extend the achievements of the revolution. It is in this pressure of the revolutionary masses, purposefully led by the revolutionary workers' party, that there exis ts a source of strength, power, courage and energy of the revol utionary Parliament, break- ing the resistance of the reactiona ry forces; that there exists an instrument of the real will of the peop le which is capable of playing an excep tional part in the \"peaceful\" transfor- mation of the capitalist society into a socialist one. And it is this principle of utilizing pu rposeful devel opment and orga- nization of pressure \"from belo w\" referred to at the 20th Congress of the CPSU, which stands out in the sharpest con- trast with the old re formist theory and practice of the \"Par- liamentary road'' which isolates and forgoes the pressure of the popular masses.

The united mass organizations, which were led and influenced to a large extent by the Com- munists, represented, in this wa y, virtually the di rect reserves of the Party. Through them the strong infl uence of the policy of the Communists also penetrated into the other political par- ties and thus the unit y of the National Fr ont was strengthened from below over the heads of the leaders.

ROH, as a class and socialist organization, consol idated the unity of the work- ers' class; it enhanced its re volutionary strength and weight and, under the leadership of the Communist Party, it used this strength most effectively for th e fortification of the people's democratic power and for the advancement of the socialist revolution. Other means for influencing a nd guiding the working masses were in particular: The United A ssociation of Czech Peasantry, the Association of Liberated Political Prisoners, the Associa- tion of Friends of the Soviet Un ion, the C.S. Y outh Federation, etc. A great help for the guidance and organization of the revo- lutionary fight of the peasants were the so-called \"Peasants' Commissions,\" whose members c ould be only farmhands, ten- 22"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"ant farmers and small and medium farmers from the ranks of applicants for land. This network of broad national mass organizations was used by the Communists for the popularizatio n of their policy and slogans, and for engendering and organizi ng the initiative of the masses and for using the various forms a nd actions of the pressure \"from below\" for the pur pose of implementing that policy. Use of Protests, Demons trations, and Strikes The second experience gained in the strugg le \"from below\" is the many-sided use of the proper forms of pressure exerted by the popular masses. These forms corresponded to the complicated class situation in the conditions prevailing unde r the people's democratic order, when the work ers' class assumed power but the bourgeoisie still kept part of the power. On the one side, all the old proven forms of the struggle of the popular masses were em- ployed, the forms whic h were in keeping w ith the revolutionary initiative and determination of th e workers and matched the de- gree of resistance shown by the bo urgeoisie: calling of protest meetings, passing of resolutions, sending of delega tions, organiz- ing mass demonstrations and also, eventually using strikes, in- cluding general strikes (when finally the open political clash with the bourgeoisie was brought about in February 1948). The strength and striking power of the individual actions of the pressure \"from below\" were constantly increased as need arose, and were safeguarded by exceptional organizational forms. An especially prominent role was played in this by the \"Congresses of Factory Councils\" and the \"Congresses of Peasants' Commissions\" (when th e political crisis was re- solved in Slovakia in the autumn of 1947; in the struggle for nationalization of private capita list enterprises with over 50 employees and the entire domestic and foreign wholesale busi- 23"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"ness; when the demand was pressed home for land reform above 50 hectares; and when the po litical crisis was settled in February 1948). On the other side, the Communist s, aided by the network of na- tional mass organizati ons (and by the pressure \"from above\" ex- erted by the organs holding powers, espe cially the national committees and the government), developed new forms of pres- sure \"from below,\" meeting the situation when the workers' class was proceeding with the assump tion of power. These forms must be particularly noted. They are the organization of a broad build- ing movement on the basis of voluntary brigades (coal, harvest, machine, etc.), and the advancement of competition in produc- tion within the factory and on a state-wide scale. These \"con- structive\" forms of pressure \"f rom below\" fortified the overall position of the people's democrat ic state, paralyzed the efforts of the bourgeoisie to bring about an economic and political up- heaval and, through th eir results (fast ec onomic consolidation of the country and a rising stan dard of living of the working people), permanently entrenched and reinforced the power po- sitions of the workers' class in the country. This third most valuable experience gained by our workers' class is the creative applicatio n of the principal condition for pressure \"from below,\" much em phasized by Lenin, that is to say arming the proletariat (V. I. Lenin stressed, in his work \"Two Tactics,\" two principal c onditions for the pressure from below: the proletariat must be armed because the threat of a civil war exists, and the prolet ariat must be led by a revolu- tionary workers' Party.) The workers' class armed itself in the course of the national and democratic revolution. Even after the victory of that revo- lution it retained its arms, however. One pa rt of it, from the ranks of the part isans, barricade-fighters and from the units of 24"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"the C.S. corps formed in the Soviet Union, became the nucleus of a new armed state apparatus, especially the security appara- tus under the control of the Ministry of the Interior which was in the hands of the Communists. The second part, the so-called Factory Guards, permanently secured the safety of the works. In case of danger of an attack by the counter-revolution, individual parts of the workers' class were armed: in the summer of 1947 the former partisans were armed for the liquidation of the Bender groups in Slovakia and, in February 1948, when the preparations for a counter-revolu- tionary conspiracy by the bourge oisie were uncovered, strong, armed people's militias were formed . In the last instance, it was the arming of the workers' class which took away the bourgeoisie's liking for an ar med conflict, which prevented bloodshed and ensured the undisturbed cour se of the revolu- tion. (The necessity of arming th e most mature part of the workers' class for repulsing th e counter-revolu tionary machi- nations of the bourgeoisie and for ensuring the undisturbed building of socialism has been proved, incidentally, again by the later formation of the workers' militias in people's demo- cratic Hungar y and Poland.) The armed parts of the workers' class thus represented a very real and concrete form of the pressure \"from below\" directed against the counter-revolution an d a very concrete and effec- tive support for the workers' forc es in the organs of the state. Of great importance for the in ternational workers' move- ment are not only the experience gained in the individual forms and actions of the pressure \"from below\" (corresponding to the concrete historical conditions), but also the absolute necessity of such a pressure as proved ag ain by the actual practice which ended in victory. The pressure of the popular masses \"from be- low\" (in the totality of all its forms and concrete actions) made 25"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"it impossible for the representative s of the other parties of the National Front, controlled by the bourgeoisie, which had nu- merical superiority in the decisi ve organs endowed with power, to isolate the Communists and to stop the revolution. Thus it (the pressure . . .; Tr.) made up for the numerical weakness of the revolutionary representatives of the workers' class in these organs and enhanced their strength; it contributed in a decisive manner to the accepta nce of further revolutionary measures weakening the bourge oisie and fortifying the power of the workers' class. This experience, that pressure \"from below\" is absolutely essential for the undi sturbed unfolding of the social- ist revolution, is also reflecte d, in full measure in the theory about the possibility of the revol utionary utilization of parlia- ment in connection with the road to socialism. The combination of the pressu re \"from above\" with that \"from below\" — the path towa rd the progressive, undis- turbed breaking of the resistance of the bourgeoisie, toward the gradual limitation and making impossible of a show of force by the bourg eoisie. The real possi bility of the revolu- tionary utilization of parliame nt for the road to socialism lies, therefore, in the combined mass strength of the revolu- tionary acting people su pporting parliament as a revolutionary active assembly which fights for the system- atic fulfillment of the demands of the working people. This coordination of actions by the broad popular masses and the revolutionary forces in parlia ment, in the government and in the local organs of power , mutually germinates their strength, drives the revolution ahead and infuses it with at- tacking and penetrating power.

This question is very topical and it is discussed especially among the comrades of those Communist Parties who have ori- entated themselves toward a pe aceful transition toward the so- cialist revolution.

Iannucci and Florimont Bonte. \"When reading F.

Comrade F.

Confiscation of Private Land In accordance with the Kosice government program, the first big transfer of land was effected in people's democratic Czecho- slovakia. 2,946,395 ha [hectares] of land belonging to big hold- ers, enemies and traitors was confiscated and allotted, on the basis of decrees, to 305,148 families of agricultural workers, tenants and small-holders, and put partly un der the administration of the co- operatives, national committees and the state. This land reform re- sulted in the almost complete liq uidation of big holdings of land in the border regions, but the cent ral parts of the country were af- fected by these decrees to only an insignificant measure. Big land- owners, holding a bove 50 ha of land, and th e Church still retained some 1,400,000 ha of agricultural la nd, which means almost a fifth of the entire land. An economically and numerically strong sec- tion of kulaks still represented a very important fo rce of the bour- geoisie in the countryside and the bourgeoisie was still most influential with the medium farmers as well. The possibility of a further su ccessful advance of the revo- lution depended on the reinforcem ent of the influence of the workers' class and of the CPCS in the countryside, on a further strengthening and widening of the bond between the workers' class and the working peasantr y. The road for this was the struggle for further demands of th e peasants (especially the still unquenched thirst for land), a more intensive campaign for un- covering the face of the bourgeoi sie and further subversion of the biggest bastion of the bourgeoisie in the countryside — the landholders' owners hip of the land. In the summer of 1946, the Communists began the fight for 28"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"handing over more land to th e working peasan try (simulta- neously with the demands that the allotted land should be speedily registered in the land rolls, that hunting rights should be democratized, boundary adjust ments should be effected and the splitting up of agri cultural land should be prevented and that the agricultural production plan should be safeguarded). They demanded a revision of th e land reform of 1919, which the bourgeoisie had carried out in the pre-Munich republic. The revision affected a total of 1,027,529 ha of land and its materi- alization would mean the complete liquidation of the group of big landowners with over 150 ha of arable or 250 ha of agri- cultural land, the grou p of the so-called \"r est-estate holders\" and land speculators. The demand for the revision of the first land reform of 1919 was pressed home by the Communi sts in the program of the new government after the electi ons in May 1946 (\"The Build- ing Program\"). In the autumn of 1946 the Ministry of Agricul- ture, controlled by the Communist s, submitted this demand (along with others) as a draft bill to the working peasantry for their comments (the so-called si x Duris Acts). The fight proper for carrying out a revisi on of the first land reform was, there- fore, started by pressure from above. The acceptance of the demand for a revision was bound to affect severely the big land-o wners and the co untryside bour- geoisie and, by this, the bourgeoisie as a whole. The bourgeoi- sie, making use of its positions in the leadership of the other parties of the National Front, in Parliament and in the govern- ment, therefore, started to put up resistance against it immedi- ately. It tried to prevent the acce ptance of this law or to clip it and, in this way, to retain bi g land-ownership . A sharp class fight with the bourgeoisie deve loped over the acceptance of this law. 29"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Pressure From Above Trigge rs Pressure From Below The pressure \"from above\" exerted by the Ministry of Agri- culture (i.e., emanating directly from the supreme organ of the state — the government) by coming out with the draft law and openly inviting the working peas antry to comment on and to support it, triggered off, at the same time, a strong pressure \"from below.\" The peasants discussed the draft proposals of the law at their meetings and their overwhelming majority demanded its accep- tance. In the villages in which there was land subject to revi- sion, \"Peasants' Commissions\" were set up as the organs of the landless, small and medium farmers — applicants for land. The demand for the revision wa s backed up more and more strongly by the local national committees (representing pres- sure from below, vi s-a-vis the higher administrative organs, Parliament, and the leadership of the other parties of the Na- tional Front), by th e United Association of Czech Peasantry and by the local organizations of the other political parties. Liquidation of Private Property To increase the effectiveness of the pressure \"from above\" and \"from below\" against the bourgeoisie, the Communists proclaimed (on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture) addi- tional far-reaching demands for the working peasantry, the so- called \"Hradec Program.\" Its basic demand was the division into lots of all big estates of over 50 ha and the complete liqui- dation of land held for the purpose of investment [lit.: specula- tion; Tr.] (Furthermore the intr oduction of peasants' insurance, grants of agricultural credits a nd protection to peasants, the in- troduction of a uniform agricultural tax graded in accordance with production areas, the size of farms, the number of depen- dents, etc., a speedy mechaniza tion of agriculture aided by the 30"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"state, especially the establishment of State Tractor and Machine Stations). The area of land subject to division according to this demand amounted to 432,905 ha, situated in 9,540 parishes, i.e., in two thirds of all the parishes in the whole state. This meant that ad- ditional masses of sraall and me dium farmers were drawn into the decisive fight for the liquid ation of big estate ownership (and the other demand s). The struggle for the revision of the first land reform ente red the next, decisive stage. In the sum- mer the proposal of the law was debate d by Parliament. The Communists used these debates for uncovering the bourgeois leadership of the National Socialist, the Popular and the Demo- cratic parties, and pr oved them to be furi ous defenders of the land owners and enemies of th e working peasan try. Every at- tempt of the bourgeoisie at thwa rting, delaying or limiting the proposed law was brought out into the open by the Commu- nists in Parliament and pillorie d. On June 9 and 10 alone the central organ of the Party, \"R ude Pravo,\" published a number of such disclosures made on the floor of Parliament (\"The Rep- resentatives of the Big Land-Own ers in Parliament Against the Peasants,\" \"They Wa nted to Give the Big Land-Owners and Rest-Estate Holders Millions of Hectares of Forestry Land,\" \"The Secretary General of the National Socialist Party, Dr. Krajina, Threw the Peasants out of the Lobby of National So- cialist National Assembly Members,\" etc.). The Communist pressure in th e government a nd in Parlia- ment (the pressure \"from above \") engendered more and more decisively the pressure \"from be low.\" Thousands of resolutions from meetings of peasants de manding the immediate accep- tance of these laws were submitted to Parliament and the gov- ernment. The resolutions, which were also signed by the village organizations of the National Socialist, Popular and Demo- 31"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"cratic parties, said : \"...we now recognize who is with us and who is against us.\" Dozens of Peasants' Commi ssions, com- posed of members of all the poli tical parties, came to Parlia- ment and stormily warned the leadership of the bourgeois parties not to obstruct their demands, claiming their immediate implementation. (For instance, th e largest of these delegations was composed of 57 members of the National Socialist party, 35 members of the Popular part y, 38 Social Democrats, 153 Communists, 15 members without political allegiance, and 48 members who did not state to which party they belonged.) On July 11, the pressure fr om \"above\" and from \"below\" closed like the claws of a pair of pincers. The bourgeoisie, whose political positions were perceptibly shaken, had to give way. The bill on revisi on of the first agricu ltural reform was passed by the Parliament. The consequences of this victory were: the liquidation of more of the economic positions of the bourgeoisie in the village, a big political defeat of the bour- geoisie (its increasing isolation) , a considerable strengthening and broadening of the bond between the workers' class and the working peasantry. The peasants recognized that, given direct political, organizational and material help of the wo rkers' class, they could lead a successful fight against their arch-enemy, the landowner and his helpers. Increa singly wider masses of peas- ants were coming over to Party positions and supported its po- litical line aiming at further deepening of the revolution. Industry Nationalized By a similar method, the claw s of the pincers were being closed by pressure from \"above\" and from \"below\" in the years 1945-1948, penetrating deeper and d eeper into the flesh of the bourgeoisie. Thus, when the liqu idation of the political and economic positions of the occupiers and of the treacherous na- 32"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"tive grand-bourgeoisie was comple ted in the cour se of the na- tional and democratic revolution on the basis of the Kosice pro- gram, further groups of the bourgeoisie were gradually annihilated as the revolution progressed. The nationalization in October 1945 liquidated particular ly the economic power of the financial bourgeoisie, the gro up of industrialists dominating until then the key industries and the basic sources of raw mate- rial and the group of factor y owners employing over 500 em- ployees. Apart from the 62 per cent of the industry already national- ized another 13 per cent of the \"small confiscates\" were torn from the hands of pr ivate enterprises in spring of 1947. The revision of the first land reform signified the liquidation of the group of big landowners owning over 150 hectares of arable or 250 hectares of agricu ltural land, and the liquidation of the owners of \"residue\" farms. In the autumn of 1947 these \"pin- cers\" helped to carry out the \"Millionaires' Levy\" and to solve the political crisis in Slovaki a caused by the sabotage and counter-revolutionary activity of the strongest Slovak political party, the democrats. All these class clashes with the bourgeoisie had far-reaching political consequences. The influence and strength of the bour- geoisie was collapsing; the broad masses gathered with grow- ing resolution around th e CPCS and its policy. Undermining Political Opposition At the end of 1947 and the begi nning of 1948 an actual dis- integration of the National Socialist, the People's and the Democratic parties, took place. Honest members of these par- ties were parting with their bourgeois leadership and were com- ing over to the ranks of th e CPCS and the Slovak CP (by November 1947, when the Commu nists had gained 237,384 33"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"new members since the beginnin g of the year, the CPCS was stronger than all other political pa rties taken together), or cre- ated opposition groups within their own parties. The isolation of the bourgeoisie within the pa rties of the National Front was proceeding not only from the outside, through the turning away of the broad masses from parties ruled by the bourgeoi- sie, but also from within, throug h the growth of democratic and socialist forces in these parties; through the growth of progres- sive opposition, seeking the main tenance and strengthening of people's democratic freedoms an d rights and, therefore, en- deavoring to cooperate with th e Communists. From the bottom and over the heads of reactionary leaders of the other political parties the National Front grew constantly stronger as a class and social unity of the worki ng people, recognizing the CPCS as its leader, the Party which wo rked toward a total socialist reconstruction of the country. The progress of the class struggl es confirmed that the CPCS would gain in the forthcoming el ections a decisive majority and would achieve the fulfillment of its other demands with the help of a democratically manifested will of the people. It de- manded the liquidation of all private capitalist enterprises em- ploying over 50 people, a total liquidation of the group of local and foreign merchants and a total liquidation of landowners owning over 50 hectares of land. Thus, the situation of the bourgeoisie was, at the begin- ning of 1948 on the eve of th e new parliamentary elections, substantially different from that in 1946. While prior to the elections in 1946 the bourgeoi sie had a relatively strong mass basis, the short time of less than two years of people's democratic development had been sufficient for the disinte- gration of the political army upon which it could formerly count. The broad masses of the people, especially working 34"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"peasants, lost their illusions as regards the bourgeoisie and went over to the side of the workers' class in order to place the bourgeoisie and its anti-popular and treacherous policy into the right light in the eyes of our nations. In 1948, when the decisive fight between the workers' class and the bour- geoisie drew closer, the bourgeoisie had only a shade of the power and influence that it used to have in 1945. In this situ- ation, the bourgeoisie, frightened by this peaceful progress of the revolution which kept removing and destroying its economic and political positions one after another and which threatened their complete annihilation within a short time, decided to violate the lawful ways and to achieve its counter-revolutionary aims thro ugh a coup. It was signaled by a government crisis provoked by the resignation of 12 min- isters. But by this the bourgeoisie only offered another new and open evidence of its sp irit of disruption; it achieved its own isolation and complete defeat. After five days of government crisis, the people settled their accounts with b ourgeoisie reac- tion, legally and constitutionally (under consistent use of all forms of pressure from \"above\" and from \"below\"). The Revolution Consolidates Political Power The representatives of the bourge oisie and their agents were replaced in the government, abso lutely legally and in accor- dance with the constitution va lid since pre-Munich days (1920), by new representa tives faithful to the people, selected from the ranks of the reconst ituted National Front and recog- nizing the leading role of the Co mmunists in the state; the gov- ernment was nominated by the President of the Republic and was unanimously approv ed by Parliament.

Quite rightly, he draw s attention to the fact that a bourgeois state is not just th eParliament but also an enormous bureau- cratic, military and police apparatus, and he asks in the light of this warning: \"Is it possible to believe that the bourgeoisie would 'yield' by a simple 'act of parliament' or without a 'civil war,' without an 'armed uprising'?\" No, the bourgeois ie has never yielded its power by a simple \"act of parliament.\" But it may be deprived of its power at an opportune moment without an ar med uprising and civil war — by the force of consistently acting revolutionary masses led by the revolutionary wo rkers' party, supporti ng their representa- tives in the parliament and tran sforming the parliament into an active revolutionary assembly. In the fight for the direct national, democratic, peaceful, eco- nomic and social demands of th e people, by a combined pres- sure from \"above\" and from \"below,\" the position of the bourgeoisie in the or gans of power and in the state apparatus may be weakened, step by step, and so may its economic posi- tions, and thus the workers cl ass heading the popular masses may be given, step by step, c onditions more fa vorable for its fight for socialism. (Naturally, these demands will always be founded upon the concrete situat ion prevailing in the country concerned and will greatly differ. For example, defense of na- tional interests by cancellation of all agreemen ts and treaties with the United States of America damaging to the interests of the nation; prohibition of all war propaganda, punishment of warmongers and active support of the policy of collective se- curity; abolition of all forms of racial, religious and national 37"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"discrimination; fight against th e monopolies, and their nation- alization; carrying out of a land reform; introduction of a gen- eral system of social security ; abolition of every kind of economic, social and legal inequa lity of women; separation of Church and state; etc.) In the co urse of the fight for these na- tional, social, economic and politi cal demands of broad masses of the working people, the foll owing may and must be carried out successfully: a br oadly founded democr atization and reor- ganization of the orga ns of power (for in stance, the principle that all the organs of state power, from top to bottom, are elected by the people; the abolition of the senate and concen- tration of all power in the hands of the parliament; a democra- tization and reorganization of the state apparatus — courts, police, army, etc.). This broad democratization is carried out, in principle, by the gradual destruction of the bourgeois state apparatus and its transformation in to an instrument and source of power of the new democratic might. Therefor e, the Eighth Congress of the Italian Comm unist Party, whic h worked out the Italian line to be taken on the road to socialism, empha- sized that the parliament may and must carry out its active function, both in the interest of a democratic and socialist trans- formation of the country and in the new socialist society; \"It must be stated that the f undamental condition for its ful- filling this function is that it must take its initiative, impulses and inspiration for its regenera tive activity from the new po- litical and administrative system in the state — towns, prov- inces and regions — as define d by the constitution and the forms of directing democracy which are materi alized through the participat ion of the worker s' classes in the political-eco- nomic direction of the state.\" (Political resolution of the Eighth Congress of the Italian Communi st Party, \"Information Bulle- tin, International Political Questions,\" No. 1-2, p. 87.) 38"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"All these measures and their consequences (a systematic strengthening of the positions of power of the workers' class and the gradual weak ening and destructi on of the economic- political supports of the bourgeoisie) are, in their entirety, the actual way toward a limitation and perhaps excl usion of any violence of the bourgeoisie agains t the people and thus toward prevention of civil war. In this case, in the course of the fight for a complete takeover of all power by the workers' class, no notice can be taken of the pres ent relationship between class forces; it must be considered what this relationship will be dur- ing the time of gove rnment of the revolu tionary democratic might. Thus, at the moment when the bourgeoisie is in danger that all power is about to be ta ken over by the workers' class, it will be by far not so powerful and its main supports will be undermined. Progress toward socialism ma y take, under these circum- stances, a democratic and co nstitutional course. The parlia- ment, which will be an active revolutionary assembly relying upon the revo\\utionary mass movement of the workers' class and its allies, will turn into an instrument of the workers' class on its way to power, in to an instrument of the transformation of the whole state and its m achinery. Under these circum- stances, all the changes which, in their entirety, represent a revolutionary transformation of capitalist society into a social- ist one will proceed ab solutely legally. The parliament may pass, in a democratic and legal way and in the name of the na- tion, a new constitution codifying and making possible a so- cialist transformation of the country.

Thus, progress toward socialism, with the help of the par- liament and without a bloody civil war, is a real possibility. However, this possibility must not raise false illusions among the workers' class which must not be, in the least, morally disarmed by doubts as to its right to take to arms in every case when forced to do so by the resistance of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, the 20 th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party proclaimed with absolute frankness: ''There can be no doubt that for a number of capitalist coun- tries a violent downthrow of the bourgeois dictatorship and, with it, a connected vehement acceleration of the class struggle is inevitable. \" Thus, the 20th Congress of th e Soviet CP proclaims, in full harmony with the spirit of Marxism-Leninism, that at the present historical stage in the development of society, the possibility, of breaking the resistance of the bourgeoisie against socialist transformation of the society by non-vio- lent means, without recourse to revolutionary violence, has matured or will mature in many countries. But the workers' class and working people will not renounce armed fight and revolutionary violence where it is inevitable in order to break the resistance of the exploiting classes. Thus, it uses Lenin's paraphrase: \"A delivery may be difficult or easy. Naturally, we are all for an easy and painless delivery. Con- ditions for such a delivery are now favorable.

I. Lenin: \"Works,\" vol. 29 of Czech edition 1955, p. 394.) \" ... There can be no su ccessful revolution with- out a suppression of the resistance of the exploiters.\" (V. I. Lenin: \"Works,\" vol. 28 of Czech edition 1954, p. 66.) The re- formist \"parliamentary way to socialism\" denies the necessity of a revolutionary transition of capitalist to socialist society, denies the necessity of a social ist revolution, denies the neces- sity (under the slogan of \"par liamentary democracy\") of sei- zure of all power by the workers' class, denies the necessity of acquiring the political direction of the state and of establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat. The reformist \"parliamentary way\" cannot, therefore, in its consequences, ever lead to the building up of socialism; is not, in its substance, a socialist pro- gram. It is capable of attacki ng within the framework of capi- talism, with varying force, th e consequences of capitalist exploitation but is not capable of grasping its causes, of smash- ing capitalism and materializing a revolutionary transformation 41"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"of society. These deep-rooted dissimilarities of the two approaches cor- respond to a similarly profound difference in the tactic in mak- ing use of the parliament. The substance of the tactic of revolutionary us e of the par- liament is fully based upon the ol d principle of revolutionary activity of the workers class in a bourgeois parliament, worked out in detail by the classics of Marxism-Leninism and further developed in the new conditions. It starts from the following principle: Parliament in bourgeoi s countries is a product of his- torical development and cannot be erased from life. It is neces- sary, therefore, to work in it a nd to use it in th e fight against bourgeois society. The task of the representatives of the workers' class in the bourgeois parliament has always been to transform the parlia- ment into a mirror showing the working masses the class inter- ests and conflicts of bourgeois society in their nakedness and to unveil, consistently and unf linchingly, the bourgeoisie and its helpers (whether they are aw are of their position or not). Their task has always been to use bourgeois pa rliament as a platform for revolutionary agit ation, propaganda, and organi- zation, as an effective form to unchain revoluti onary activity of the broad popular masses, side by side with the workers' class. Linking and systematic combin ation of parliamentary and non-parliamentary actions has always been the fundamental principle of revolutio nary tactics in maki ng use of the parlia- ment. This tactic of linking and comb ining of the parliament with revolutionary actions of the proletariat and the working masses outside the parliament, still used by Marxist-Leninist parties, may be given a new ta sk in the new histor ical conditions and 42"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"under the new circumstances; name ly, to transform the parlia- ment from an organ of the bourgeoisie into an instrument of power of the workers' class, a nd parliamentary democracy into an instrument for the establishm ent of a proletarian democracy, of a dictatorship of the proletariat. The tactic of using parliament as a pote ntial new specific form of transition to socialism is therefore only a further de- velopment, another step of the ol d Marxist-Leninist tactic com- bining the use of parliament with the use of th e revolutionary masses, and is by its whole substance a complete antithesis to the reformist parliamentary way to socialism. In the same way as the revolutionary tactic of ma king use of the parliament cor- responds to the revolutionary aims of the Marxist-Leninist party, the tactic of reformist us e of parliament corresponds to the reformist aims of rejection of revolution. To the reformists, parliament (an instrument of the bourgeoi- sie for strengthening and maintaining capitalist power) is an or- gan for cooperation between the workers' class and the bourgeoisie. Partial reforms achieved in the parliament (in agreement with the capitalists) serv e the reformists as evidence that peaceful coexistence of bour geoisie and the workers' class is possible, that class struggle is dying down, that revolution is superfluous and political dominat ion of the workers' class un- necessary. Instead of the necess ity of a proletarian democracy, they sustain the illusion of a parliamentary, pure democracy. Because, in the reformist conception, parliament is an organ of cooperation of the workers' cl ass with the b ourgeoisie, the reformist tactic takes the weight of political work exclusively to the parliament (i.e ., organ of bourgeois power), rejects and refuses the use of the pressure of broad popular masses, iso- lates parliament from the revolut ionary actions of the working people. The reformists have al ready taken care, by their own 43"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"deeds, of offering not one but scores of examples of the abso- lute impossibility and absurdity of their \"parliamentary way to socialism.\" The Socialist \"Labour\" Parties In many countries the reformis ts won the majority, often ab- solute majority. Their government s were in existence, and have been in existence, for extended periods of time. One of the chief propagandists of this way, the British Labour Party, already has three times had an opportunity to turn its \"theories\" into prac- tice. It held the government in 1924, in the years 1929 through 1931, and for six years in 1945 through 1951. The Swedish So- cial Democratic Party has for 25 years already, a whole quarter of a century, been the strongest and the governing party in the country (in this year's* elections to the Riksdag, the lower chamber of the Swedish parliament, it won 108 mandates, while the second strongest party, the Agrarian Union, obtained only 20 mandates). A similar situation prevails in other Nordic states. And still socialism is not built in these countries. To the contrary, capitalist dom ination grows stronger, the profits of the monopolies are rising. There could be no clearer eviden ce of the absurdity of the idea that socialism may be built in cooperation with capital- ism, without bringing down the political might of the bourgeoi- sie, without the dictatorship of the proletariat. (As a matter of fact, the bourgeoisie in capitalist states has a justified confi- dence in the reformists, as the present situation in France shows) While it breaks in one pl ace, by a strike or by blood- shed and force of arms, it entrus ts the \"government\" to the re- formist socialists without hesitation if need be. And it knows why.

In spite of its absolute hopelessness the theory of \"a parliamentary way to so- cialism\" is still alive in the capi talist states and appeals to the backward part of the working cl ass and especially to the petty bourgeoisie (in view of the long, opportun istic influence ex- erted upon the masses which again is in direct connection with the idealization of parliamentar ianism carried out by every means by the bourgeoisie). Opportunist ideology and practice are, th erefore, a serious obstacle to the creation of a broad and revolutionary movement of the masses fighting consistent ly for democratic and socialist demands. They are a serious obstacle to the efforts of the work- ers' class to transform the par liament into an instrument of power of the working class and must, therefore, be systemati- cally and energetically fought. The Communists and the workers' parties seeking to make a revolutionary use of the parliament in the fight for the transi- tion to socialism may follow our advice fr om the time of the transition of the democratic revolution into a socialist revolu- tion. This advice clea rly demonstrates the grave danger of re- formism and some of its concrete signs, which can be discovered even in the activity of the Social Democratic Party in conditions of the people's democratic system, a party which used to have a comparatively strong left leadership and fol- lowed a policy of cooper ation with the Communists. Accelerating the Communist Revolution In the complicated class conditions of the years 1945-1948, when the question of power in people's democratic Czechoslova- kia was not yet definite ly settled and when pow er was still shared by the workers' party a nd the bourgeoisie, two basic political lines 45"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"were opposing each other. One was the revolutionary political line of the workers' class, which had as its purpose and aim the achievement of a gradual isolatio n of the bourgeoisie and the clos- ing of the ranks of the nation ar ound the workers' class and its vanguard, the Communist Party. Its aim was the transition from the tasks of national a nd democratic revolution to the tasks of a socialist revolution and the defini te settlement of the question of power by consolidating pe ople's democracy into a state of the dic- tatorship of the proletar iat. The second basic political line was the line of the bourgeoisie whose aim was to isolate the workers' class and its vanguard, the CPCS, to ha lt the national and democratic revolution and to attain with the help of Western imperialists the restoration of the capitalist domin ation under a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. In this tug-of-war situation, when the class struggle was ac- celerating, the worker s' class fighting fo r complete political power was attacked from the rear by the reformist ideology and practice of the \"democratic way to socialism\" as preached by the right wing of the Social De mocratic Party. While the work- ers' class under the leadership of the Communists was locked in battle with the bourgeoisie for a deeper an d broader hege- mony among all classes of working pe ople, a battle for the strengthening and consolidation of its leading role in the na- tion, the reformists came forwar d with their theories denying the leading role of the proletar iat and proclaiming its merging with (and thus absorption by) th e other classes, for instance, with the peasantry. The progress in agri cultural production an d the technical revo- lution in agriculture signify \"tha t the peasantry moves with in- creasing momentum to the level of the workers, that the two massive sections of the working people become economically bal- anced and that thus the centuries-old wall between the worker and 46"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"the peasant, between town and country, is inevitably disappear- ing. No doubt, this results in all the political consequences, for now the peasants as well become the bearers of technical and social, and thus also political (!) and cultural progress; like the workers, they uphold the struggle for a new social order (!) and take their place by the side of the worker s in the socia list movement...\" (\"Minutes of the 20th congress of the Central Committee of the Social Democratic Party,\" page 80.) This is a clear example of revision of the Marxist theory of classes. The peasantry (including the rich peasants who were the chief bearers of technical prog ress in our villages), the pri- vate owners of land, become, th rough the progress made in ag- ricultural production (capitalist production) and through the introduction of technical means (as well as capitalist), just like the workers' class, the bearers of the struggle fo r the socialist social order. What else could the bourgeoisie wish, concentrat- ing its efforts at br eaking the hegemony of the workers' class in the nation? How far was this theory suppressing the differ- ence in purpose of th e individual classes a nd social groups in the socialist revolution from th e voices of the bourgeoisie it- self: \"The nation is not compos ed of one occu pation or class and it is to its benefit that all occupational and class interests be harmonized, for an excessive elevation or attenuation of one class must necessarily mark a detriment for the other classes and thus for the whole whose gain must be our only aim.\" (\"Lidova Demokr acie,\" 10.6.45.) The \"Democratic Way to Socialism\" It is as if this transparent wish ful thinking were the father of the theory of a permanent peaceful coexistence of capitalism and so- cialism in one state, of the merg ing of antagonistic classes. \"To us, nationalization or socializatio n of key positions in production 47"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"and distribution and pr otection of private ownership of small and medium production units, and especi ally of private ownership of small and medium agri cultural property, are an expression of a wise and economical orga nization. . . The mate rialization of this plan will lead to gra dual elimination of class conflict in human society.\" (\"Draft proclamation ...,\" page 566.) Within the framework of this \"democratic way to socialism,\" obstinately supported by the ri ght wing of the Social Demo- cratic Party, the pr ivate capitalist producti on sector was to be preserved permanently and so was the bourgeoisie with its still powerful economic foundation. Also permanently to be pre- served was its position of streng th, used to the dissipation of the country's economy and for po litical discrimination against the workers' class heading the state. Also, the old reformist understanding of the role of parliament manifested itself under the influence of the right wing of social democracy, both in theo ry and practice, in the years 1945-1948 and was in crass conflict with th e revolutionary line of using the parliament followed by the Communi sts. In complete accord with that line, the 20th Congress of th e Social Democratic Party pro- claimed that \"the center of all political life will be the National Assembly\" (p. 66). The proclamation of this principle was not made by chance. \"In ev ery (!) democracy parliament support for the will of the people is the most important.\" (\"Social Democracy and the Rights of the National As sembly,\" \"Cil,\" 1946, page 5.) \"In the parliamentary system (bourgeois as well?) decisions are made before the eyes and under the direct co ntrol of th e people.\" (V. Erban, \"Svet Prace,\" 14.9.46) What this meant in practice was well defined in A. Samek's article entitled \"On the Reactionary Role of the Social Democratic Ideology of Transition of National and Democratic Revolution into a Socialist Revolution\" 48"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"(\"Filosoficky Casopis,\" vol. 1955, No. L): \"In practice this meant th at whenever the people manifested its will otherwise than through it s representa- tives in the National Assembly , the right wing of Social Democracy raised its voice in opposition to it. When in the course of the fight for the 'Hradec Program' the Com- munists appealed straight to the people and when the peasants approved this program at their meetings and sent their representatives to the National Assembly to voice their demands, the right wing of the Social Democratic Party reacted as follows: 'T he Communists began to ar- range public meetings of the peasants. This grew into a whole campaign organized with a view to compelling the National Assembly, also with th e help of deputations dis- patched to the parlia ment to pass the draft submitted by the Ministry of Agriculture w ithout change. With such in- fluencing of the parliament and with these methods em- ployed by the Minister, we could naturally not agree.' (Report on activity, p. 13.) Th e people must not take a resolute position against the bourgeoisie; it is only al- lowed to discuss through its representatives in the parlia- ment. When the bourgeoisie kept pronouncing, due to its position in the Ministry of Ju stice and in the Courts, dis- gracefully mild sentences ag ainst traitors and when the people raised their voices resolutely against this state of affairs, the CS So cial Democratic press wrote that the Courts (in the given case, th e bourgeoisie), and not the street (i.e., the working peop le), should judge.

When the National Assembly discusses the bill on the enlightenment of officers of the security force, CS Social Democratic deputies submit a resolution stating that political education of the SNB is unnecessary! Thus the workers' class was to be deprived of its impor- tant weapon. On 2 July, 1946, 'Pravo Lidu' writes that CS Social Democracy will not let itself be influenced by pub- lic proclamations, stoppages of work, demonstrations, etc. These facts prove clearly that Social Democracy opposes the true rule of the people and tries to undermine the po- litical activity of the worki ng people, limit their political horizon, and make them a helple ss tool in the hands of bourgeois politicians.\" This characteristic may be supplemented by an example demonstrating how the theory and practice of Social Demo- cratic isolation of parliament from the re volutionary struggle of the masses of working peopl e suited the bourgeoisie. When, in the fall of 1945, the bourgeoisi e opposed the decree nation- alizing key and heavy industries, the CPCS decided to appeal to the people. A gigantic mass movement for nationalization ensued, pressing the bourgeoisie with its back against the wall. The bourgeoisie, afraid of the pressure of the popular masses, proclaimed: \"We consider any pressure demanding an acceler- ated approval of the decree to be harmful. The government needs nothing more than peace a nd time . . . .\" (\"Lidova Demokracie,\" 26.9.45.) The pressure of the people's masses holding the bourgeoisie in its pincers was to be relaxe d. The Social Democratic Minis- ter of Industry, Lausman, attempted at the decisive moment to frustrate the political activity of the working people. \"Folks, 50"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"have patience, the draft decree on nationalization of big indus- try has 46 paragraphs and we are arguing the first.\" (\"Pravo Lidu,\" 24.9.45) From Capitalism to Socialism Through Democracy In order that the reformist \"democratic way\" to socialism be complete, there had to be, of cour se, a denial of the basic con- dition of the possibility of victory for socialism — of the dicta- torship of the proletariat. \"Our state has decided for socialization in the democratic manner, that is to say, through the ballot and not through revoluti on and dictatorship.\" (\"Min- utes of the 20th congress of the Social Democratic Party,\" page 161.) Thus, solving the problems of transition from capitalism to socialism, of breaking the desperate resistance of the bour- geoisie, of expropriating the e xploiters and transforming small private capitalist production into socialist production on a large scale, should be possible without the direction of policy by the workers' class, without the dictatorship of the proletariat — just by phrases about some kind of pure democracy; in other words, revision and denial of the basic maxim of Marxist- Leninist theory of cl asses and class struggle. The reformist theory and practice of the \"parliamentary way,\" although flavored by new conditions, remained what it has always been, even on the soil of people's democracy, a theory and practice of the defe nse of the bourgeoisie. Its aim was the undermining of the leading role of the working class in the revolution, for it denied th e necessity itself of a revolu- tion, proclaimed th e possibility of a pe rmanent cooperation with the bourgeoisie, attempted to isolate Parliament from the revolutionary pressure of the working people and preserve it as an organ for co-operation wi th the bourgeoisie, negated the necessity of a dictatorship of th e proletariat, and instead of a 51"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"necessity of a proletarian democracy it nurtured illusions of \"pure democracy.\" Therefore even in the people's democratic system in which the working people under the leadership of the Communist Party are able to see daily, in the course of at- taining political, economic and so cial demands, the result of their revolutionary un ity and of the perfid y of the reactionary bourgeoisie, it was necessary to fight systematically against the destructiveness of reformism subservient to the bourgeoisie. The Social Democratic Party, which, as a whole, was already following the policy of cooperation with the Communists, was purposely cited as an example of the strong influence of re- formism and of its dangers. Mu ch more open and also much more transparent was the reformism of the National Socialist Party proclaiming \"national soci alism,\" definitely rejecting Marx' theory and atte mpting, without sham e, to strengthen capitalism. This warni ng experience convincin gly points to one of the basic conditions of a revoluti onary use of Parliament for the purpose of transition to socialism; namely, to the necessity of \"de- cisive rejection of oppor tunist elements unable to drop the policy of compromise with the capitalis ts and landowners.\" (20th con- gress of the Soviet CP, \"Nova Mysl,\" February 1956, p. 23.) Therefore, if the workers' cla ss is to create under its leader- ship a united revolutionary popular movement able to break the resistance of the reactionary bourgeois forces, if it is to trans- form a bourgeois parliament into an organ of the will of the working people and to use it as an instrument for a peaceful transition to socialism, it must fight systematically and ener- getically against reformism with its treacherous ideology and practice. Therefore, it is the duty of the workers' class to con- tinue and step up its criticism of the reformists who, following their theory of the \"parliament ary way to socialism,\" cannot and do not want to use the parliament in the fight against 52"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"the capitalists and refuse to mobilize, organize and utilize the people's masses against the counter-revolutionary bour- geoisie. The fight against the opportunis ts who are unable to drop their policy of coop eration and compromise with the capital- ists and landowners, whether they are aware of it or not, can- not be separated from a systema tic and purposeful effort to establish cooperation and to create a unit y of action with So- cial Democratic and other socialist parties. This has been made possible by the change of objectiv e and subjective processes in the world during this present hist orical epoch. The struggle for the preservation of national independence, democracy, peace and the betterment of the social position of the working people presents itself, under present conditions, increasingly as a com- mon task of Communist and all other political parties and or- ganizations which acknowledge the principles of socialism and democracy. In the present situatio n, not the quest ions of fun- damental differences should be emphasized but those questions which are common and which re flect immediate interests. Evidence of the possibility and su ccess of such a struggle is again to be found in our own expe rience. In the course of the fight against the occupiers and their helpers among the big bourgeoisie in this country, in the course of the fight for the recovery of national and state independen ce and of the anti- fascist fight for democratic right of the people, a broad National Front of workers, peasants, tr adesmen, intellige ntsia and part of bourgeoisie was created. This National Front, headed by the workers' class, represented a de cisive internal force ensuring the victory of the national and democratic revolution.

The existence of the \"socialist bloc,\" whose representatives were in the majority in government, coul d signify the possibility of a relatively fast transition to socialis m while a continuous strengthening of left and truly socialist elements in the non- Communist parties was proceedi ng. The practice and develop- ment of the forces in the count ry has shown, however, that the main significance of the agreement was the fact that this agree- ment, concluded before the eyes of rank-and-file members of the parties concerned, strengthen ed the unity of the workers' class and made it more difficult for the bourgeoisie and its agents in the leadership of th e National Socialist and Social Democratic parties to find a wa y out of the obligation to ex- ecute the government program wh ich had become the political foundation of the bloc. (It fulfilled the tactic al principle of ob- taining from all unreliable alli es concessions, obligations and promises as far-reaching as possi ble, this being the surest way to compromise them and to help the faithful allies within these parties. This device and this form of cooperation may lead in another situation in other countries to a gradual rapprochement between the socialist parties and this to far greater and deeper consequences.)

Thus, for instance, when in 1947 the Communists put forward in the government the demand of a \"Millionaires' Levy\" for the benefit of the peasants su ffering through th e consequences of a catastrophic drought, even the representatives of the So- cial Democratic Party raised their voice against this demand. The Communists immediately or ganized a common stand and pressure by the popular masses, especially a common and reso- lute stand of the workers' class, for the approval of this de- mand. \"Rude Pravo,\" the central organ of the CPCS, published immediately after the refusal to approve the \"Millionaires' Levy\" the names of all the ministers who voted against the measure and added the following disclosure: \"All these gentle- men were elected by our people in the honest beli ef that they have subscribed to the program of the National Front. However, by their attitude, they demonstrated to the broad masses of work- ers, peasants, office workers and tradesmen who elected them that they protect millionaires, specula tors, industrialists, landowners and merchants. There are only 35 ,000 such people in our country. Their votes would hardly suffice for two mandates. In fact, they found supporters in the four par ties of the National Front in the government.\" (\"Rude Pravo,\" 4.10.57.)

This agreement contained ve ry important obligations on both sides: 1. to submit a comm on draft proposal for the \"Million- aires' Levy\"; 2. to proceed jointly in the question of remuneration of state employees; 3. to fight for the unity of the National Front and to ap- peal to the membership of bo th parties to act in unity from \"below.\" From Democracy, to Socialism, to Marxism This whole tactic offers a clear example of the decisive in- fluence of unity at the bottom upon the possibility of effective cooperation with the leadership of other socialist parties. This tactic which the Communists em ployed during the whole pe- riod 1945-1948, i.e., du ring the period of tr ansition from na- tional and democratic revolution to socialis t revolutio n, led to a strengthening and greater decisi veness on the left wing of the Social Democratic Party and to its successive shift to the posi- tions of true revolut ionary Marxism and, th us, to its gradual ideological harmony with the Co mmunists.

While the tasks and the form of the dictatorship of the prole- tariat established by the proletariat in the October Socialist Revolution corres ponded to the actual hist orical situation in Russia and to the contemporary relationship of internal and in- ternational class forces, the tasks and the form of the dictator- ship of the proletariat in peop le's democratic Czechoslovakia correspond to the actual historical situation in Czechoslovakia. This form of the dictatorship of the proletariat differs by a num- ber of points from the form adopted by the October Socialist Revolution: • By the existence of the National Front as a political expres- sion of unity between the workers' class and the working peasantry and the other working people; • By the existence of more politi cal parties with in the frame- work of the Nationa l Front. These non-Co mmunist political parties are, in their substance, petty-bourgeois parties, fully recognizing, however , and subordinating themselves to, the leadership of the CPCS and se rving the building of socialism and the common fight of the people for peace; • By the recognition of former bourgeois parliamentary institu- 58"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"tions, such as the parliament, president, etc., which have, however, adopted a new, socialist purpose; • By not depriving the bourgeoisie of the right to vote, having adopted the principle of universal, secret and direct ballot. Our way has supplied a definite proof that Marxism-Leninism has nothing in common with a \"cult of violence\" and has shaken very seriously the lying propaganda of reformism, at- tempting to persuade the work ing masses that the basic dif- ference between the revolution ary workers' movement and reformism lies in the question of a \"non-bloody\" way to so- cialism. The violence employed by the Great Socialist Octo- ber Revolution was forced upon the proletariat of Russia by Russian and internatio nal bourgeoisie. This violence of the Great Socialist October Revolu tion, was therefore, only a necessary, specific aspect corres ponding to the historical situ- ation, and not a generally valid rule of a socialist revolution. In 1919, in the midst of a gr ave civil war in Russia and in the days of the fou ndation of the Hungaria n Soviet Republic, V. I. Lenin proclaimed: \"In a state in which the bourg eoisie do no t offer such furious resistance, the situat ion for Soviet power will be easier; it will be able to work there without violence, with- out the bloody way forced upon us by Messrs. Kerensky and the imperialists . . . Other countries arrive at the same goal, Soviet power, by another, more human way . . .

The example of H ungary will be decisive for the proletarian masses, for th e European proletariat and for the working peasants.\" (V. I. Lenin: \"Works,\" vol. 29, CS edition, 1955, page 264, 265.) Also, a \"cult of violence\" ca nnot be followed by the work- ers' class, because a violent armed fight is not at all advanta- geous to it from the point of view of its aim — the achievement of a complete socialist revolu tion. This aim combines two in- separable tasks: to oust the power of the bourgeoisie and to or- ganize a new, higher method of social production, to organize and build socialism. The latter task is more serious and more difficult, for it is the greatest source of strength required for the definite victory over the bou rgeoisie, a source of firmness and steadfastness of the dictat orship of the proletariat. It is just this more difficult and serious, more decisive task that the workers' class can fulfil much faster with the help of peace production forces, withou t a civil war — which is un- thinkable — without disorganizat ion of the coun try, destruc- tion of production forces, withou t the sacrifice of the best cadres of the workers' class which, instead of following the slo- gan, \"All for the fastest social ist transformation of the coun- try,\" must execute the slogan \"All for the victory on the civil war front.\" When V. I. Lenin evaluated th e reasons for the imperialist intervention in the Great Socialist October Revolution and its consequences, he pointed to the following fact: \"The West European capitali st powers did everything possible, partly on purpose, partly spontaneously, to throw us back and to use the civil war in Russia for the greatest possible devastation of the co untry. It was just this out- 60"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"come of the imperialist war which had considerable ad- vantages for them: if the revolutionary order in Russia could not be extirpated, then, at least, the progress toward socialism could be retarded. This was the way in which these powers were thinking, and from their point of view they could have hard ly thought differen tly. In actual fact they reached the aim half wa y. They did not destroy the new order brought about by the revolution but they did prevent it from making such progress that would confirm the correctness of socialist predictions enabling the social- ists to expand rapidly the production forces and to develop all those possibilitie s which form the ba sis of socialism, to prove to the whole world cl early what enormous forces are hidden in socialism and th at humanity was now enter- ing a new stage of developm ent with extraordinary and splendid opportunities.\" (V. I. Lenin: \"Works\", vol. 23, CS edition, 1955, p. 498.) The Czechoslovak example is evidence that an apparently slower progress of socialist revolution (by gradual transition of national and democratic revo lution into a socialist revolu- tion) was actually the faster wa y, because the two-in-one task of the socialist revolution began to be fulfilled simultaneously. While fast removal of the conse quences of war, efforts to re- new quickly production forces, economic progress of the coun- try, a new working discipline , advance of education and culture, were at first aimed at the total political defeat of the bourgeoisie, all these ef forts, in their cons equence, created si- multaneously the main conditions of a faster and more definite securing of power in the hands of the working class. In Febru- ary 1948, i.e., at the time when the workers' class had already achieved all political power and when the people's democracy 61"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"was realized as a state of the dictatorship of the proletariat, (a) the state apparatus was already in existence in principle and the working class could use it in its fight for socialism; (b) the first important successes ha d already been achieved in creating a new working discip line and a new relationship to work; (c) the working masses had already gained experience in state, organizational and educational work; (d) new forms of organization of working people were in ex- istence, as required for leading the broad popular masses in socialist building; these new forms repr esented an impor- tant part of the system of the dictatorship of the proletariat following a complete assumpti on of power by the working class; (e) the economy of the country, di srupted by the war, was al- ready rehabilitated in principle. All this is created and achieved by the proletariat only after its victory, if violent attainment of socialism through civil war must be chosen. This is truly convincing evidence that a \"cult of violence\" is absolutely unacceptable for Marxist-Leninist parties because it is in conflict with th eir fundamental needs and aims. The confirmation of this principle by the actual course of our revolution has gr eatly enhanced th e attraction of socialism. The Czech Example: Building Proletaria n Internationalism In appraising our experiences and our contribution to the in- ternational workers' movement this must not be forgotten. The possibility of the peaceful progre ss of socialist revolution mak- ing revolutionary use of the parliament, as pointed our by the 62"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"20th Congress of the Soviet CP, is a product of new class con- ditions created by far-reach ing objective and subjective changes in the world. It is a pr oduct of class co nsequences re- sulting from the existence of the world socialist system and its political, economic and ideological strength. People's demo- cratic Czechoslovakia, as one of the most highly industrialized states in the world, is a very im portant part of this system. The fast industrial expansion and the growing standard of living in people's democratic Czechoslovaki a take a direct part, through their consequences, in the changes in objective and subjective processes in the world, processes weakening capitalism and strengthening socialism. They ta ke an active part in the cre- ation of conditions in which the possibility of th e peaceful ad- vancement of socialist revolution exists and in which it can be materialized. The working people of Czechoslovakia, like the working masses in all countries of the worl d socialis t system, have the good fortune that thei r building and their systematic raising of the living standard also promote the concrete pur- pose of their proletar ian internationalism . Through their suc- cesses, they prepare the ground for the Comm unist parties, for the workers' classes and for the broad masses in the capitalist countries and countries depend ent upon them for a peaceful transition to socialism with the he lp of the Parliament. (The ex- ample of Hungary demonstrates how every success, and every failure, exerts a direct and deep influence on the formation of the fundamental force for this transition — on the formation of a broad united popular front on the winning ov er of new allies of the workers' class.) Such is and must be our cont ribution, an unusually valuable and instructive contribution, to th e international workers' move- ment, a contribution to the creation of conditions favorable to an accelerated march of the wo rld proletarian revolution. 63"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"About Robert Welch University Press ... This new edition of And Not A Shot Is Fired is an edifying suc- cessor to Philip Dru: Administrator — the premier book-length publication of Robert Welch Univer sity Press. In the Foreword to Philip Dru, j ournalist William Norman Grigg described that novel (written by Woodrow Wilson's \"alter ego,\" Edward Mandell House) as being an essential part of any political science student's collection of \"political works whic h are read primarily for precau- tionary reasons.\" Though published as a work of fiction in 1912, Philip Dru served as a clear blueprint for the heinous \"isms\" of the middle part of this century that drew the world into two world wars, and coerced a substantial po rtion of the earth's po pulation into living under totalitarian collectivism. And Not A Shot Is Fired is a cas e study of the effects of such machinations on a single countr y — Czechoslovakia. Thomas R. Eddlem notes in its Foreword: \"This document is a 'how-to' manual for totalitarian takeover of an elected parliamentary sys- tem of government through mainly lega l and constitutional means.\" Kozak and his co-conspir ators manipulated the Czecho- slovak people into voting themselv es into slavery by using what he called \"pressure from abov e\" and \"pressure from below.\" But why should a busy modern Am erican set aside the time to read this brief history of an extinct state? The reason is that the same tactics described in Kozak's book are in wide use today, by other conspirators. As former Cz echoslovakian Vice-Premier Petr Zenkl warned: \"Read it and heed it, gentlemen of the Free World, while you are free.\" The administrators of RWU Press do not take lightly the re- sponsibility of making revealing studies of this caliber readily available to all students, instructor s, and devotees of political sci- ence and public affairs. (Or at leas t to those sufficiently inspired to approach these studies from a perspective of true intellectual fervor, curiosity and, we woul d hope, a commitment to improve 75"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"the human condition.) In selecting titles for publication, the editors of RWU Press shall be guided by a philosophy of re spect for intellectual, histori- cal, and ethical truth — rather than by the current trend of \"po- litical correctnes s.\" For the former is pe rennial, the latter is transitory. \"There is one thing a professor can be absolutely certain of,\" noted University of Chicago professor Allan Bloom in The Clos- ing of the American Mind, \"almost every student entering the uni- versity believes, or says he believes, that truth is relative.... The relativity of truth is not a theo retical insight but a moral postu- late, the condition of a free society, or so they see it. They have all been equipped with this framework early on, and it is the mod- ern replacement for the inalienable natural rights that used to be the traditional American grounds for a free society.... Openness used to be the virtue that permitt ed us to seek th e good by using reason. It now means accepting everything and denying reason's power.\" It is \"not a means to e xploring different answers to the great questions, but an excuse not to try to answer them at all.\" Robert Welch University Press w ill not flee from its self-as- signed mission to explore \"different answers to the great ques- tions.\" The most pressing question of al l, in the contex t of American society on the eve of the Twenty -first Century, is: How can we preserve, defend, and export America's greatest commodity: a legacy of political freedom in which all other freedoms — cultural, religious, economic, and academic — will flourish? 76"}]
