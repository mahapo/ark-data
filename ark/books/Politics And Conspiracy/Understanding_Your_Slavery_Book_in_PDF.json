The U.S. government today does not remotely resemble or respect the ideals of the original republic, which the government school system still celebrates and pretends exists. It now parallels the same system that was used to control the tax slaves/ actual slaves in Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union and East Germany. In addition to sharing mechanisms of control and indoctrination, these governments are all illegitimate because it is impossible to delegate rights you don’t have personally to “representatives.” For example, If you don’t have the moral right to coerce money from your neighbor and redistribute it to others, then you can’t delegate that “right” to a “representative” — even if the majority agrees. Voting can’t change morality, and just because the mob wants to lynch black folks or rob Peter to pay Paul, it doesn’t mean those actions are legitimate by ‘virtue’ of the majority outnumbering its victims. Unfortunately, using violence to control society is organized crime, and the control system known as “government” has always been used to fleece the population. Those in power have tended to use the same techniques through history. They control educational institutions to perpetuate propaganda and indoctrinate the pseudo-religion of Statism into children. Statism is the propagandized belief in the necessity, desirability, and legitimacy of government. It is a mind control technique and pseudo-religion because there is no such thing as “government.” Introduction"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"- 6 - You can’t go to Washington D.C./ “Mecca” and touch “government!” You can touch buildings and people, but “government” is just an idea . It is a “supernatural entity” that promises to make the world a better place: to feed the poor, to protect the weak, and to provide for your retirement. It can even raise wages and lower prices at the same time! Is there nothing the State can’t do? Pursuant to government power, free children are brought up in mandatory schools believing that because they were born on this side or that side of an imaginary line (a border), they are “American” or “Canadian,” for example, and — by virtue of where they were born — now owe half their income in overt/covert taxes and inflation to organized crime using well-recognized “cult indoctrination” techniques and propaganda on them. Some cult members are so mind-controlled they even shave their heads and murder whomever the cult leaders tell them to or lock peaceful people in cages for victimless crimes. The idea that Americans are “free” when they are forced to pay as much as half their income in overt taxes, covert taxes, and inflation while putting up with the government’s myriad rules, regulations, monopolies and licensing schemes borders on ludicrous. “Americans” are victims of a multi- trillion dollar con-game through which they have been indoctrinated and secretly propagandized into an artificial belief system that teaches them to be “tax-payers” and some to be “order- followers” to kill and enforce on their fellow tax slaves. It is a system based on lies, brainwashing, propaganda, and the immoral, poisonous idea that some people can be “delegated” the “authority” to rule others. The acceptance of the legitimacy of “authority” is the acceptance that you are a slave and must obey a master.

One of the biggest secrets kept from public (government) school children is that the world is a self-organizing system that produces spontaneous order and that all the “services” provided by government — from protection to roads to charity — can be better provided by voluntary interaction, the free market, and real charity. Freedom doesn’t guarantee utopia, but it is the most moral alternative that unleashes the creativity and capital creation mechanisms of the market. Voluntaryism/anarchism are political movements that reject the engineered belief system of Statism in favor of true freedom and voluntary interactions between free people. It is the most moral of all the political systems in that is recognizes natural law and honors the Non-Aggression Principle (NAP), which posits that no individual or group of individuals has the right to initiate violence and coercion against other human beings who are not aggressing against them — in other words, live and let live, unless someone is threatening your life or property. All other political philosophies (socialism, communism, monarchy, democracy, etc.) allow a ruling class to engage in violence and coercion against the majority. Though these systems may even allow elections where the winning party is allowed to rob everyone in society to enact its stated political goals, elections amount to ritualistic theater (especially when they only represent a minority of the eligible voters and the winner was outnumbered by citizens who didn’t vote at all). In addition to the travesty that occurs when majority rule tramples the rights of the minority, elections are also easily rigged and controlled by moneyed interests to offer the illusion of control to the tax slaves who are ignorant/willfully ignorant of the ‘big con’."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"- 8 - Nazi Germany US Government Current Soviet Union/Russia East Germany 1933-1945 1776-Present 1922-1991 1949-1990 Flag – This is a pseudo-religious symbol that evolved from war banners that war parties carried in battle.

It is a completely indoctrinated belief system I.E. it has been mandatorily taught to the overwhelming majority of the public through government schools and private schools where the government controls the content of instruction through textbook amalgamation and tradition. Statism is a pseudo-religious belief I.E. “Government” is not a physical entity that can be touched. It is a supernatural entity that promises to make the word a better place for the true believers who have accepted the belief system into their world view. The multi-generational oligarchical kleptocracy (kakistocracy) that has been ruling the planet from behind the scenes uses the same techniques that religions and cults use on their followers to indoctrinate the masses into accepting a ruling class. These techniques include: Religious symbolism in the form of the �lag, “holy documents” in the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, mandatory “church” schools, common prayer where children are required to recite the pledge of allegiance every day at school and at scouting meetings, More common prayer and militarism at sporting events where the government pays teams for the privilege, taking school children on �ield trips to Washington DC (Mecca) where they are taken to the monuments (temples) to see the Founding Fathers (deities), etc. These techniques produce “citizens” (cult members) willing to hand over ½ their income and, in the case of the enforcement class (police) the techniques produce a classic “shave-headed cult member” willing to kill and cage non-conformists who ignore or violate the laws (commandments) handed down by the Congress/Courts (church leadership) who sit “above” the citizens and wear robes (vestments). In the case of the military (shave-headed cult members) they are willing to go abroad and kill whom they are told in wars/”police actions” (crusades). Key Concepts There is No Such Thing as “Government” • You can’t go to Washington DC and touch “Government” • It is an idea/belief system that is indoctrinated into kids by gov’t schools and most private/parochial schools through tradition and textbook amalgamation The word “Government” literally means “Mind Control” in Latin • The translation of the original Latin is “To Control the Mind”. The root words are: • Gubenare – Control, Govern, Rule • Mens – Mind The belief in “Government” is mandatorily indoctrinated into the masses • No one is born believing that handing over ½ your income in overt taxes, covert taxes, and in�lation to a ruling class is a good idea • Human beings are free, sentient beings who don’t owe their allegiance/income to anyone just because they were born on one side or another of an imaginary line. • Mandatory “free” government K-12 schools & accredited private schools spend ~12,000 hours indoctrinating and legitimizing this belief system in a hidden curriculum • The belief is reinforced through government institutions, government, police, scouting (pre-military training & �lag worship), paid-for militarism/statism at sporting events and a propaganda system where 6 companies running hundreds of subsidiaries give the illusion of choice but are controlling the information the masses receive to limit their knowledge and secretly reinforcing the status quo and “legitimacy” of the system in movies, television shows, magazines, etc. The government schools use classical “cult indoctrination” techniques on kids • Most government teachers/administrators are ignorant/willfully ignorant of the hidden curriculum and brainwashed themselves and don’t know/refuse to research the history of the Prussian education system and its creators own admissions that the system was designed to control the masses and instill obedience to authority: • Indoctrination Techniques include: • Common Prayer: The pledge of allegiance at school and national anthem at sporting events • Civics and social studies that teach kids the Statist world view • Focus on learning about the Presidents (Popes) and legitimacy of Gov’t • Socialization of the enforcement class (police) through D.A.R.E.program • Promotion of military, selective service, and military recruiters in schools • Obedience Techniques include: • The inability to leave or even go to the bathroom without permission • Public shaming (Red, Yellow, Green) and collective punishment • Responding to Pavlovian bells, walking in line, obedience to police, etc. Understanding Your Slavery: The Religion of Statism www.UnderstandingYourSlavery.com"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"- 34 - Understanding Your Slavery is a series of one-page overviews of concepts hidden from the public by a ruling class (oligarchical kleptocracy/kakistocracy) that has been controlling the �low of information in society and human perception through their control of the government, government schools, scouting, intelligence agencies, military and police training, and a weaponized media system of 6 companies running hundreds of subsidiaries to give their tax slaves the illusion of choice while propagandizing them, deceiving them, and distracting them from the reality of their existence and slavery.

A quote from the commission: \"The CIA currently maintains a network of several hundred foreign individuals around the world who provide intelligence for the CIA and at times attempt to in�luence opinion through the use of covert propaganda. These individuals provide the CIA with direct access to a large number of newspapers and periodicals, scores of press services and news agencies, radio and television stations, commercial book publishers, and other foreign media outlets.\" - http://involuntaryservant.blogspot.com/2009/03/bought-and-paid-for-central-bankster.html “The CIA owns everyone of any signi�icance in the major media” – Former CIA Director William Colby \"It is worthy of remark that a belief constantly inculcated during the early years of life, whilst the brain is impressible, appears to acquire almost the nature of an instinct; and the very essence of an instinct is that it is followed independently of reason.\"—Charles Darwin, The Descent of Man , 1871 My favorite analogy about the LameStreamMedia is that the former Soviet Union was a very poor country. They could only afford 2 state propaganda organs: Pravda and Izvestia. In Russian Pravda means \"Truth\" and Izvestia is loosely translated as \"The News\". The running joke in the Soviet Union was: “There is no truth in Pravda and there is no news in Izvestia”. We are/were a very wealthy country... We have 6 major propaganda organs.

By glorifying collectivism and authority, public (government) schools prime children to tacitly accept subsequent authoritarianism from all realms of government and military. From monopolizing students’ time and demanding they ask permission for basic human functions — like going to the bathroom — to imposing one-size-�its all teaching approaches, submission and conformity are constantly promoted. Students are indoctrinated into the pseudo-religion of statism using the same techniques employed by other cults: for example, pledges/oaths, holy documents, trips to D.C. to see the temples/deities. Selectively presented snippets of history support these myths, imbuing students with an unshakable faith in the government’s universality, inevitability, and righteousness. Militarism and nationalism pervade the system through junior training programs like ROTC, and the state’s legitimacy is never questioned or debated. Other methods of control permeate the system. In recent years, the pharmaceutical industry has bene�itted from the increase in diagnoses of ADD and ADHD in children, which is largely due to children’s inability to conform to schools’ rigid standards of control. These drugs, as well as mandatory vaccines, directly affect students’ body chemistry. So do the vast supplies of genetically modi�ied, pesticide-ridden foods provided by state-empowered conglomerations. Because of these hidden methods of control and modern consequences of rampant statism, public schooling is ground zero for producing obedient statist subjects and order followers willing to kill on command. Key Concepts Obedience to the government, police and authority �igures is lesson #1 • Assigned seating imposes constant, uniform control over student movement • Drill bells dictate where and when students may move during the course of the day • Students are usually required to collectively stand and pledge allegiance to the �lag, which continues with the additional “common prayer” of the anthem at sporting events • If students are late or do not adhere to other standards, they face punitive measures, including public shaming and Red/Yellow/Green troublemaker boards • On the other side of the coin, students are often forced to face collective punishment for the actions of a single student • Police are increasingly present in schools, patrolling campuses and enforcing security checks with metal detectors and conducting random searches of students’ private property, reinforcing the notion that school is a prison — and everyone must submit to government (organized crime) control from an early age. Indoctrination into the hidden religion of Statism is “Education” • Students are expected to pledge allegiance to an arti�icial religious symbol in a kind of “common prayer” on a daily basis from K-12 • They are taught that gov’t is both legitimate, necessary and desirable without ever examining those premises or the immorality of the concept. • Young students learn of the mythology of the “Founding Fathers”, “social contract”, the holy documents of the Constitution/BoRs, the justi�ications for the gov’ts murderous wars, and that stealing is OK when gov’t does it! • What is left out of these lessons is equally important, from the CIA’s covert, undemocratic operations to the Federal Reserve and the real reasons for war • Whether it is history, civics, or any other subject, teaching methods usually require memorization, regurgitation, and often, standardized, multiple choice testing methods that crush independent thought and promote obedience. Chemical Control • Thanks to propagandized obedience and state-sanctioned in�luence of the pharmaceutical industry and food industry, children are pumped full of chemicals, from ADD and ADHD drugs and mercury and aluminum-laced vaccines to toxic processed food with genetically modi�ied (GMO) ingredients, sugar , glutamates, glyphosate , re�ined grains, rBGH , BPA/BPS, soy, and �luoridated water . • Classic indoctrination methods, combined with a fetish for submission and the modern American government-sponsored corporatocracy, create docile Statist children, some of whom ultimately shave their heads and become “order followers”."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"- 40 - Understanding Your Slavery is a series of one-page overviews of concepts hidden from the public by a ruling class (oligarchical kleptocracy/kakistocracy) that has been controlling the �low of information in society and human perception through their control of the government, government schools, scouting, intelligence agencies, military and police training, and a weaponized media system of 6 companies running hundreds of subsidiaries to give their tax slaves the illusion of choice while propagandizing them, deceiving them, and distracting them from the reality of their existence and slavery.

Everything about the government school system is wrong: segregation by age vs. ability, the compulsory pledge of allegiance, and the use of collective punishment, corporal punishment, and public shaming as obedience techniques. Red/Yellow/Green classroom management techniques, restrictions on movement without permission, lack of freedom to use the restroom without permission, mandatory vaccinations, and indoctrinating kids into a hidden religion: Statism.

It has always happened that tyrants, in order to strengthen their power, have made every effort to train their people not only in obedience and servility toward themselves, but also in adoration. Resolve to serve no more, and you are at once freed. I do not ask that you place hands upon the tyrant to topple him over, but simply that you support him no longer; then you will behold him, like a great Colossus whose pedestal has been pulled away, fall of his own weight and break into pieces. Tyrants would distribute largess, a bushel of wheat, a gallon of wine, and a sesterce: and then everybody would shamelessly cry, “Long live the King!” The fools did not realize that they were merely recovering a portion of their own property, and that their ruler could not have given them what they were receiving without having first taken it from them. Liberty is the natural condition of the people. Servitude, however, is fostered when people are raised in subjection. People are trained to adore rulers. While freedom is forgotten by many there are always some who will never submit. The dictator does not consider his power firmly established until he has reached the point where there is no man under him who is of any worth. ... This method tyrants use of stultifying their subjects cannot be more clearly observed than in what Cyrus did with the Lydians after he had taken Sardis, their chief city, and had at his mercy the captured Croesus, their"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"- 73 - fabulously rich king. When news was brought to him that the people of Sardis had rebelled, it would have been easy for him to reduce them by force; but being unwilling either to sack such a fine city or to maintain an army there to police it, he thought of an unusual expedient for reducing it. He established in it brothels, taverns, and public games, and issued the proclamation that the inhabitants were to enjoy them. He found this type of garrison so effective that he never again had to draw the sword against the Lydians. These wretched people enjoyed themselves inventing all kinds of games, so that the Latins have derived the word from them, and what we call pastimes they call ludi, as if they meant to say Lydi. Not all tyrants have manifested so clearly their intention to effeminize their victims; but in fact, what the aforementioned despot publicly proclaimed and put into effect, most of the others have pursued secretly as an end. Men are like handsome race horses who first bite the bit and later like it, and rearing under the saddle a while soon learn to enjoy displaying their harness and prance proudly beneath their trappings. Men will grow accustomed to the idea that they have always been in subjection, that their fathers lived in the same way; they will think they are obliged to suffer this evil, and will persuade themselves by example and imitation of others, finally investing those who order them around with proprietary rights, based on the idea that it has always been that way. “There are always a few, better endowed than others, who feel the weight of the yoke and cannot restrain themselves from attempting to shake it off: these are the men who never become tamed under subjection. These are in fact the men who, possessed of clear minds and far-sighted spirit, are not satisfied, like the brutish mass, to see only what is at their feet, but rather look about them, behind and before, and even recall the things of the past in order to judge those of the future, and compare both with their present condition. These are the ones who, having good minds of their own, have further trained them by study and learning. Even if liberty had entirely perished from the earth, such men would invent it. For them slavery has no satisfactions, no matter how well disguised.”"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"- 74 - Etienne de la Boetie 2 is the nom de guerre of a voluntaryist/anarchist author, father, technology entrepreneur, cyclist, runner, hot yogi, racquetballer, scuba-diver, multi-disciplinarian truther, armchair economist, cryptocurrency enthusiast, and neo-abolitionist who is experimenting with large-scale cult deprogramming.
