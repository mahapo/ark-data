He sat down and pulled out a travel magazine, just as any other travel er would. Aside from one Bolshevik manqué who stopped by to say hello, no one paid any attention. A friend reports that he was on the same train a few months ago with then Prime Minister, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, wh o was accompanied by only a single aide. Many years ago, when the United States was still a modest republic, American presi dents were likewise available to alm ost a nyone who wanted to shoot them. Thomas Jefferson went for a walk down Pennsylvania Av- enu e, alone, and spoke to anyone who came up to h im. John Adams used to swim naked in the Potomac. A woman reporter got him to talk to her by sitting on his clothes and refusing to budge. But now anyone who wants to see the presi dent m ust have a back- ground check and pass through a m etal detector. The Wh ite House staff must approve reporters before they are allowed into press conferences. And when the U.S. head of state travels, he does so in imperial style; he moves around protected by hundreds of praetorian guards, sharpshooters on rooftops, and thousands of local centurions. When Presi dent Clinton went to China in 1998, he took with him his family, plus “5 Cabinet sec- retari es, 6 members of Congress, 86 senior aides, 150 civilian staff (doc- tors, lawyers, secretari es, valets, hairdressers, and so on), 150 military staff"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"2 SLOUCHING TOWARD EMPIRE (drivers, baggage handlers, snipers, and so on), 150 security personnel, several bomb-sniff ing dogs, and many tons of equipment, including 10 ar- mo red limousines and the ‘blue goose,’ Clinton’s bulletproof lectern.” Getting the presidential entourage and its armada of equipment to China and back, the Air Force f lew 36 airlift missions on Boeing 747, C-141, and C-5 aircraft. The Pentagon’s cost of the China trip was $14 million. Operating Air Force One alone costs over $34,000 an hour. Tod ay, the president cavalcades around Washington in an armored Cadillac. The limousine is f itted with bullet-proof windows, equally sturdy tires, and a self-contained ventilation system to ward off a biologi- cal or chemical attack. The Secret Service —the ag ency charged with preserving the presi- dent among the living—employs over 5,000 people: 2,100 special agents, 1,200 Uniformed Division employees, and 1,700 technical and adminis- trative wonks. Everywhere the presi dent go es, his security is handled—by thou sands of guards and aides, secure compounds, and carefully orches- trated movements. Security was so tight during a visit to Ottawa, Canada, in 2004 that some members of Parliament were refused entry into the building for lack of a special one-time security pass, an act apparently con- tradictory to the laws of Canada. In late 2003, when Bush deigned to visit the British Isles, an addi- tional 5,000 British police off icers were deployed to the streets of London to protect him. Parks and streets were shut down. Snipers were v isible on the royal r ooftop. 1 After Bush’s stay at Bucki ngham Palace in London, the Queen was horrif ied by the damage done to the Palace grounds. They we re left looking like the parking lot at a Wal-Mart two-for-one sale. 2 TH E THEME OF THIS BOOK IN A NUTSHELL Watching the news is a bit like watching a bad opera. You can tell from all the shrieking that something very important is supposed to be happening, but you don’tquite know what it is. What you’re missing is the plot. Let us begin by noticing that this is a comic opera that seems as though it might veer into tragedy at any moment. The characters on stage are fa- miliar to us—consumers, economists, politicians, investors, and business- me n. They are the same hustlers, clowns, rubes, and dumbbells that we always see before us. But in today’s performance they are doing som ething"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Slouching toward Empire 3 extraordinary, they are the richest people on the planet, but they have come to rely on the savings of the world’s poorest people just to pay their bills. They routinely spend more than they make—and think they can continue doing so indef initely. They go deeper and deeper in debt, believing they will nev er have to settle up. They buy houses and then mortgage them out—room by room, until they have almost nothing left. They invade for- eign countries in the belief that they are spreading freedom and democracy, and depend on lending from Communist China to pay for it. But people come to believe whatever they m ust believe when they must believe it. All these conceits and illusions that we f ind so amusing in the Daily Reckoning (www.dailyreckoning.com), come not from thinking, but from circumstances. As they say on Wall Street, “markets ma ke opinions,” not the other way around. The circumstance that makes sense of this strange performance is that the United States is an empire— wh eth er we like it or not. It must play a well-known role on the world stage, just as you and I must play our roles, not because we have thought our way to them, but simply because of who we are, where we are, and wh en we are. Primitive people play primitive roles. They are no less in- telligent than the rest of us, but they would be out of character if they began doing calculus. They have their parts to play just as we do. So- phisticated people play sophisticated roles. They are no smarter than any- one else, but you still don’t expect them to wear bones through their noses. We, citizens of the last great empire, have our roles to play too, and the empire itself, m ust do what an empire m ust do. Institutions have a way of evolving over time—after a few years, they no longer resemble the originals. Early in the twenty-f irst century, the United States is no more like the America of 1776 than the Vatican under the Borgia popes was like Christianity at the time of the Last Supper, or Microsoft in 2005 is like the company Bill Gates started in his garage. Still, while the institutions evolve, the ideas and theories about them tend to remain f ixed; it is as if people hadn’t noticed. In America, all the restraints, inhibitions, and modesty of the Old Republic have been blown away by the prevailing winds of the new empire. In their place has em erged a vainglorious system of conce it, deceit, debt, and delusion. The United States Constitution is almost exactly the same document with exactly the same words it had when it w as written, but the words that used to bind and chaff have been turned into soft elastic. The gov- ernment that couldn’t tax, couldn’t spend, and couldn’t regulate, can"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"4 SLOUCHING TOWARD EMPIRE now do any thing it wants. The executiv e has all the power he needs to do practically anything. Congr ess goes along, like a simpleminded stooge, in- sisting only that the spoils be spread around. The whole process works so we ll that a member of Congress has to be found in bed “with a live boy or a dead girl” before he risks losing public off ice. American businesses are still capitalistic. They operate, as ever yone knows, in the most dynamic, free, and op en economy in the world. A re- cent press item reports, that General Motors will neve rbeabletocom- pete unless it ditches its crushing health care costs. Why does it not just cut the costs? It seems to l ack eithe rthenerveortheright,butthejour- nalist proposed a solution: Nationalize health care! Meanwhile, CEO payh as soared to the point where the average chief executive in 2000 earned co mpensation equal to 500 times the average hourly wage. Stock- holders, whose money w as being squan dered, barely said a word. They were still und er the illusion that the companies were working for them. Th ey had not noticed that the whole capitalist institution had been trus sed up with so many chains, wires, red tape, and complications, it no longer functioned like the freewheeling, moneymaking corporations of the nin eteenth century. Meanwhile, corporations in Ch ina—a commu- nist country—had their hands and feet free to eat our lunches and kick our der rier es. Th e ent ire homeland economy now depends on the savings of poor people on the peripher y to keep it from falling apart. Americans consume mo re than they earn. The difference is made up by the kindness of strangers—thrifty Asians whose savings glut is recycled into granite coun- tertops and f lat-screen TVs all over the United States. But these ironies, contradictions, and paradoxes hardly disturb the sleep o ftheimperialrace.Theyhavepermittedthemselvestobelieveso ma ny absurd things that they will now believe anything. In the fall of 2001, people in Des Moines and Duluth were buying duct tape to pro- tect themselves from terrorist “slee per cells re ady t oattacktheMid- west.” In the fall of 2004, they believed the Chinese were manipulating their currency by pegging it to the dollar for nearly 10 years! Like Alice, they were expected to believe si ximp ossible thin gs before breakfast and another half dozen before tea: Real estate never goes down! You can get rich by spending! Savings don’t matter! Def icits don’t matter! Let them sweat, we’ll think! We can ’t help but wonder how it will turn out."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Slouching toward Empire 5 In this book, we turn once again to the dusty pages of history. We find ourselves often tracing the footsteps of the West’s greatest empire— Rome —searching for clues. In Rome, too, the institutions evolved and degraded f aster than people’s ideas about them. Romans remembered their Old Republic with its rules and customs. They still thought that was the way the system was supposed to work long after a new system of consue- tudo fraudium —habitual cheating—had taken hold. Rom e’s system of imperial f inance was far more solid than America’s. Rome made its empire pay by exacting a tribute of about 10 percent of output from its vassal states. There were few illusions about how the sys- tem worked. Rome brought the benef its of Pax Romana, and subject peop les were expected to pay for it. Most paid without much prompting. In fact, the cost of running the empire was greatly reduced by the cooper- ation of citizens and subjects. Local notables, who benef ited from imperial rul e, but who were not directly on the emperor’s payroll, performed many costly functions. Many functions were “privatized,” says Ramsay Mac- Mullen in his Co rruption and the Decline of Rome. This was accomplished in a variety of ways. Many off icials, and even the soldiers stationed in periphery areas, used their positions to extort mon ey out of the locals. In this way, the cost of administration and pro- tection was pushed more directly onto the private sector. Commoda was the wo rd given to this practice, which apparently became more and more widespread as the empire aged. MacMullen recalls a ty pical event: From Milan, a certain Palladius, tribune and notary, left for Carthage in 367. He was charged with investigating accusations of criminal neg- ligence—“if you don’t pay me, I won’t help you”—brought against Ro ma nus, military commandant in Africa. Because of Romanus’s inac- tion, the area around Tripoli, had suffered attacks by local tribes, with- out defense from the empire. But the accused was ready for the inquisitor, and when Palladius arrived unexpectedly at military head- quarters in the African capital—carrying the off icers’ pay—he was offered ...under the table...a considerable bribe. Palladius ...accepted it. But he continued his investigations, accompanied by two of th e local notables whose complaints had launched the inquiry. He prepar ed his report to th e emperor, telling him that the charges against Romanus were conf irmed. But the latter threatened to reveal the bribes he had accepted. So Palladius reported to the emperor that"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"6 SLOUCHING TOWARD EMPIRE the accusations were pure inventions. Romanus was safe. The emperor ordered that the two accuser s’ tongues be torn out. 3 As time went on, the empire came to resemble l ess and less the Old Re- public that had give n it birth. The old virtues were replaced with new vices. Gradually, the troops on the frontier had to depend more and more on their o wn devices for their support. They had to take up agriculture. “T he effectiveness of the troops was diminished as they became part-time farm ers,” says MacMullen. Gradually, the empire had fewer and fewer reliable troo ps. In Trajan’s tim e, the emperor could count on hundreds of thousand of soldiers for his campaigns in Dacia. But by the fourth century, battles were fought with only a few thousand. By the f ifth century, these few troops could no longer hold off the barbarians. Th e corru ption of the empire was complete. If you den y that the United States is now an empire, you are as big a fool as we were. For a very long time we resisted the concept. We did not wa nt the United States to be an empire. We thought it was a political choi ce. We liked the old republic of Jefferson, Washington, the U.S. Con- stitution...the humble nation of hard money and soft heads; we didn’t wa nt to give it up. We thought that if the United States acted as though it we re an empire it was making an error. What morons we were. We missed the point completely. It didn’t ma tter what we wanted. There was no more choice in the matter than a caterpillar has a choice about whether to become a butterf ly. This was an important insight for us. Until then, all of the blustering and slapstick pratfalls on stage seemed like “mistakes.” Why would the United States run such huge trade def icits, we wondered. It was obvio usly a bad idea, the nation was ruining itself. And why would it launch an in- vasion of Iraq or begin a war on terror—both of which were almost cer- tain to be costly blunders. It was as if the United States wanted to destroy itself—f irst by bankrupting its econ omy, and second by creating enemies all over the globe. Then, we realized, that of course, that is exactly what it must do. We repeat, people come to believe what they need to believe when they need to believe it. America is an empire; its people m ust think like imperialists. In order to fulf ill their mission, the homeland citizens had to become what George Orwell called “hollow dummies.” An imperial peo ple"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Slouching toward Empire 7 must believe that they deserve to be the imperial power—that is, they must believe they have the right to tell other people what to do. In order to do so, they must believe what isn’t true—that their own culture, soci- ety, econom y, pol itical system, or they themselves are superior to others. It is a vain conce it, but it is so bright and so big it exercises a kind of grav- itational pull over the entire society. Soon, it has set in motion a whole system of shiny vanities and illusions as distant from the truth as Pluto and as bizarre as Saturn. Americans believe they can get rich by spending some one else’s money. They believe that foreign countries actually want to be invaded and taken over. They believe they can run up debt forever, and that their debt-l aden houses are as good as mon ey in the bank. That is wh at makes the study of contemporary economics so entertaining. We sit at our telescopes and laugh like a divorce lawyer looking at pho tos of a rich man in f lagrante delicto; we know there’s money to be made. Things that are unusual usually return to normal. If they did not, there would be no “norma” to return to. That is why you can expect stocks to become more expensive when they are cheap and cheaper when they are expensive. Stocks today are expensive—they trade for an average of abo ut 20 times earnings. Usually, they trade for only 12 to 15 times earnings, so you can expect them to get cheaper. Ho uses are expensive too. They usually go up at a rate roughly equal to the rate of inf lation, income, or GDP growth—no more. For the past 10 years, however, they’ve gone up three to f ive times as fast. House prices cannot grow faster than income for very long; people have to be able to pay the prices in order to live in them. So, you can expect houses to revert to their mean too. Prices will fall ...or else stop rising. These simple reversions to mean are hardly controversial. We don’t know wh en they will happen or how, but that they will come about is practically guaranteed. Mo re interesting to us are the reversions to other, bigger means. An empire itself is a rare thing. It is normal, but un usual. Nature abhors a mon opoly. An empire is a monopoly on force. Nature will toler ate it for a wh ile, but sooner or later, the imperial people must revert to being nor- mal peop le, and the preposterous beliefs that the imperial people cherish, also must pass away. They must go up to a kind of humbug heaven, where absurd ideas and idle f latteries strut around while the gods point, snicker, and collapse into mirth, rolling around clutching their stomachs as if the humor of it was going to kill them."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"8 SLOUCHING TOWARD EMPIRE The dollar is an extraordinary thing too. Do you know what the long term mean value of paper currency is? Well, it is zero. That is what the av- erage paper currency is worth most of the time ...and it is the black hole into which all paper currencies in the past have gone. There could be som ething magic about the dollar that makes it unlike any paper currency in the past—that is, som ething that makes it non-m ean reverting. But if anyone knows what it is he is not working on this book. For the l ast hun- dred years, the dollar has lost value faster than the decline of the roman- era Dinarius after the reign of Nero. This is not surprising. Roman coins had silver or gold in them. In order to make the coins less valuable, they had to red uce the precious metal content. People didn’t like it. The dollar, by con trast, contains no precious m eta l. Not even any base metal. It is just paper. It has no inherent value. There is nothing to take o ut, because there was never anything there in the first place. Over time, the dollar is almost certain to revert to its real value—which is as empty as deep space. In the big picture of things, it is also unusual for one civilized nation to earn far more per capita than another. In the thousands of years of his- tory, some groups were poo r...others were rich. But extreme differ- ences had a way of working themselves out—by trade, war, pestilence, and degeneracy. By the year 1700, a man in India, China, Arabie, or Europe had about the same standard of living, which was not very high anywhere. But along came the industrial revolution, which threw incomes out of bal- ance and changed the way people think. Europe stole a march on the rest of the world’s industries, with huge gains in output coming in a relatively short period of time. Soon, Europeans were the world’s leading imperial- ists, convinced that they had its best economic system, its f inest scholars, its highest morals, and its most splendiferous armies. But if the world works the way we think it does you can expect the incomes of Europeans—and their American cousins—to revert to their historic means. The process could take several generations. It could stall. There could be countertrends. But there is no reason to think a man’s labor is inherently worth more in France than in Bangladesh, or that a plumber with stars and stripes on his overalls should earn more than one with a crescent moon. If there is a mean, things will regress to it. You can expect, relatively speaking, Asian incomes to rise and American incomes to fall. That is, of course, just what is happening now. In India, for example, real incomes have mo re than doubled in the last 10 years. In America there is some dis-"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Slouching toward Empire 9 pute about the numbers, but if there has been any income growth at all it has been slight. Just to introduce a gloomy remark, we note that we are personally and individually regressing to the mean. The mean for a human being is death—or non-existence. A person walks the earth for only three-score and 10, as it says in the Bible. The rest of the time, he is only a potential person ...or a former person. For millions of years, he is either in the fu- ture ...or in the grave. Yo u, dear reader, are enjoying that ever-so-brief period of exaggera- tion ...of hyperbole...of extrao rdinary, mean-busting usualness we call “life.” It is not for us to know the time or place when it comes to an end. But like all mean-reverting phenomena, only a fool would bet against it. ( For our own part, we do not particularly care when or how we meet our end. We just wish to know where, so we can avoid the place.) But betting against the end is just what most Americans are doing. They are borrowing and spending as if there were no tomorrow, and they are investing as though there were no yesterday. All they would have to do wo uld be to look at the patterns of the past; they would see that it doesn’t make sense to b uy at high prices—you can’t make money that way. The way people have always made money is by buying low and selling high. Do ing it the other way around doesn’t work. Nor does borrowing and spending make you rich. Tomorrow always comes—at least it always has up until now—and you have to pay your debts. Over time, prices go up and down. Many other things ebb and f low as well, boom and bust or bloom and wither. All of these phenomena go through predictable cycles that can be roughly mo deled. Ana lysts study the cycles to try to f igure out where we are currently located in the habitual pattern. It is often frustrating work, because the patterns are rarely quite as regular and well-def ined in the present as they appear to have been in the past. Still, it is a question worth asking: Where in the cycle are we? One of the ways you can tell where you are in the cycle is to look at wh at your friends and neighbors believe. Markets make opinions. We rec all that you can tell where the market really is by looking at the opinions people have. When people you know are all of the opinion that stocks will rise 15 percent per year—for an indef inite amount of time— you can be sure you are nearer to a top than a bottom. When people be- lieve the opposite—that stocks will never go up—most likely, you are near a bottom."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"10 SLOUCHING TOWARD EMPIRE Beliefs give us a clue to the larger cycles as well. People must play the roles that have been thr ust upon them. They are bullish near the end of a bull market; th ey are bearish near the end of the bear market. If it were otherw ise, the market could never fully express itself. If investors grew suddenly cautious while nearing an epic bull market peak, they would sell their stocks, and the peak would never be reached. Or suppose that after several years of soaring house prices homeowners came to believe that housing prices would fall? How could you have a proper housing bubble? Ho w can you have a rip-roaring party without a nyone getting dr unk, in other words? How can people make fools of themselves if they are unwill- ing to get up on the tables and dance? These are deep philosophical questions. But they help us recognize wh ere we may be in the cycle. As prices reach a loony excess, peoples’ ideas grow loony too. Ergo, the loonier the ideas the more likely it is that a turning point is near; the wilder the party, the more likely someone will call the gendarmes. We also suspect that attitudes evolve similarly in an imperial cycle, during which a country’s economic, f inancial, and military power runs up over several generations and then declines. At the peak, the imperial peop le come to believe that their system is superior, that their values are universal, and that their way of life will inevitably dominate the en- tire world. Re aders will recognize these attit udes in a famous article by Francis Fukayama, written after the fall of the Soviet Union, in which he sug- gested that the world may have reached the “End of History.” It was the end of history because the American system had triumphed—no improve- ment seemed possible. Fukayama’s idea was not original. Hegel and Marx- ist intellectuals had proposed the same thing more than a hundred years earlier. With the victory of the proletari at, no further advance could be made. History had to stop. Hegel stopped ticking. Marx died, too. History continued. But when people feel they are on top of the world, they begin to take thi ngs for granted that they previously thought absurd. As we mentioned earlier, Americans now depend on the savings of Communist China in order to pay for their lifestyles ...and their wars to make the world safe for democracy. They do so without thinking. Subconsciously, they’ve come to believe what imperial people always seem to believe—that their society is so superior, that the rest of the world longs to be just like them"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Slouching toward Empire 11 or is inevitably drawn to become like them, whether they like it or not. That’s the premise behind the billions of dollars Americans are investing in China. A few years ago if someone had suggested that they invest in a communist country they would have thought the person mad. China is still run by veterans of various “great leaps forward,” but Americans are convinced that they’re all leaping to become just like us—capi talists and dem ocra ts at heart! So vain are we that we can’t imagine a nyone wanting to be anything else. Likewise, we were recently in Nicaragua. We have a house down there, and we buy more land whenever we get an opportunity. Prices have soared in the past f ive years. Someone bought a beach-front lot recently for $350,000, a price that would have been thought insane a few years ago. Nicaragua is, after all, a third-world country. It is also a country that was run by communists until a few years ago. One of the communists is now a leading candidate to become el presi den te in the next election. And right now, the nation’s politicians are debating a proposed law that would dec lare all land within 200 meters of high tide “public.” In effect, we’d all lose our land, our houses, and the mon ey we’ve invested down there. But none of us quite believe it will happen, because we’re convinced that they all want to be just like us—and we’d nev er do such a thing. And of course, the invas ion o fIraqwasbasedonthesamesortofthink- ing: that even the grubby desert tribes want to be just like us. All we have to do is to get the dictator off their backs and the men will start building shopping malls and the women will all start dressing like Britney Spears. Th ose are the sort of delusions you get at the top of an imperial cycle. But culture, political systems, and economies are never as universal and eternal as we think. Instead, ever ything evolv es. Even in France, our closest cousins do not share our American attitudes. In the United States, we all seek to maximize our incomes. We work long hours. We start en- terprises. We invest. In France, people do not seek to maximize their in- com es. Instead, what they want to maximize is their leisure, and the quality of their lives. They spend more time talking about how to cook the bac on than they do about how to bring it home. France once had a European Empire that reached from Spain to Moscow. Later, it had a worldwide empire, with subject countries and colonies in Africa, the West Indies, and the South Pacif ic. From the time of Rich elieu to the time of Leon Blum, France had one of the most pow- erful armies on earth. Even at the beginning of World War II, France had"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"12 SLOUCHING TOWARD EMPIRE the largest army in Europe—on paper. But there never was a cycle that didn’t want to turn. And the imperial cycle turns along with the rest of them. For many generations, the French believed they had the f inest cul- ture, the best schools, the most advanced sc ientists, and the m ost dynamic builders in the worl d. France saw its mission as bringing the benef its of its civilization—of vin rouge and the Rights of Man—to the rest of the glob e. But now it’s our turn. It is we Americans who think we have the best culture, the best economy, the best government, and the best army the worl d has ever seen. Now, it is we who have the burden of the “mis- sion civilisatrice.” It is our duty to bring fr eedom and democracy to this tattered old ball; our president said so. Ho w did Am erica become an empire? We don’t recall the question ever coming up. There was never a debate on the subject. There was never a national referendum. No presi dential candidate ever sug gested it. No- body ever said, “Hey, let’s be an empir e!” People do not choose to have an empire; it chooses them. Gradually and uncon sciously, their thoughts, be- liefs, and institutions are refashioned to the imperial agenda. Wh ile there has been no di scussion of whether America should be an empire, there has been much public clucking on the specif ic points of the imperial agenda. Should we attack Iran or Iraq? Should we have national identity cards? Should we suspend the Bill of Rights in order to combat terrorists more effectively? Man y people wondered, including your author, what was the point of the war against Iraq. The country had no part in terrorist attacks. Au con- trair e, Saddam’s Iraq was a bulwark of secular pragmatism in an area un- settled by religious fanaticism. It was the religious fanatics who posed a danger, said the papers, not the ruthless dictators who suppressed them. Ot hers wondered if an attack on Iraq would make the world sa fer or more dangerous. Or if the United States had committed enough troops to get the jo b d one. But the big question had already been settled without ever having been raised. Why should Americans care what happened in the mid east? Or anyw here else? Did the Sw iss wonder what kind of government Iraq shou ld have? Did the Swiss try to make the rest of the world more like Switzerland, or allow themselves the vain fantasy of imagining that every- one on the planet secret ly yearned to be more like the Swiss themselves?

The debate surrounding the invasion of Iraq was an imperial debate—about means and methods, not about right and wrong or national interest. No one from either major political party bothered to suggest that the United States had no business nosing around in other peo- ples’ business. Both parties recognized that Iraq was not a matter of na- tional interest—it was a matter of imperial interest. No business, no wh ere, was too small or too remote not to be of interest to the empire. From its military bases all over the globe, and its sensors orbiting the planet, the American imperium watched ever yone, everywhe re, all the time. In the year 2005, no sparrow falls anywhere in the world without triggering a monitoring device in the Pentagon. This marks what may be the peak of a trend that began more than one hundred years ago. Just about the turn of the century, the United States became the world’s largest economy—and its fastest growing one. Near the same ti me, Theodore Roo sevelt began ri ding rough over small, poor nations. America’s fat proto-imperialist rarely saw a f ight he didn’t want to get into. It was at his urging ( he had threatened to raise his own army to do the job) that Wilson announced his readiness to join the war in Eu- rope in 1917. Wilson said he was doing it to “make the world safe for dem ocra cy.” This is the stated goal of nearly all U.S. foreign policy ever since: to improve the planet with more democracy. Of course, almost all empire builders th ink they are improving the planet. Even Alexander the Grea t thought he was doing it a favor by spreading Greek culture. But when Wilson sent troops to Europe, people wondered then what the real point was. America had no interest in the war and no particular reason to favor one side over the other. But there too, they missed the poi nt. America was quickly becoming an empire. Empires are alm ost al- ways at war—for their role is to “make the world safe.” President Truman clarif ied the imperial mo dus operandus when he sent the United States into battle in Korea with no declaration of war. He didn’t even tell Congress until after the army was engaged and Americans we re dying. Then, President Johnson followed up with another war in a far-off place that made no difference to Americans—Vietnam. What was the point? The Swiss army was nowhere to be found. And where were the Belgians? Even the French had given up on Vietnam a decade before. But mo re than three million American soldiers went to Vietnam and many came back f lat. And for what?

None of these engagements made any sense for a humble nation that minded its own business. None would have made any sense for Amer- ica until the f irst Roosevelt administration; but once the nation had be- come an empire—with a homeland and wide-ranging interests be yond it—almost all wars seemed appropri ate. Another landmark in the history of the American empire came on Au gust 15, 1971. That was the day that Richard Nixon severed the link between the imperial currency and gold. Thitherto, empire or no, the United States had to settle its debts like other nations—in a currency it couldn’t manufacture. Henceforth, the way was clear for a vast increase in empire spending ...and debt. Thus we arrive at the real problem for the American empire. It has by far the strongest military in the world. It has no serious chal lengers be- yond its borders. Hence, it had to become its own worst enemy. All em- pires must pass away. All must f ind a way to destroy themselves. America found debt. Th e traditional method of empire f inance is so simple even a Mongol barbarian could master it. Nations are conquered and forced to pay trib- ute. The homeland is supposed to make a prof it; it is supposed to grow richer compared to the vassal states. But here, America fell victim of its own scam. Pretending to make the world a better place, the United States could not very we ll require the poor nations it conquered to pay up. In- stead, it had to borrow from them. This was not a problem in the early days. Until the mid-1980s, U.S. industries were so robust they were able to take advantage of the pax dol- larium to expand sales, jobs, and prof its. But in the 1970s, the U.S. trade balance turned negative. By the year Alan Greenspan took over at the Fed, foreigners ow ned more U.S. assets than Americans owned foreign ones. American factories had grown old and expensive. American workers were paid too much. American businessmen invested too little in training and new cap ital equipment. The whole nation developed an attitude more in harmony with an empire on the decline than one that was still rising. The imperial people chose to spend rather than to save, and to hallucinate, rather than think hard. They demanded bread and circuses at home; let the Asians sweat abroad. Empires are thought by many to be good things. They expand the area in which trade can take place. In modern parlance, they allow for in- creased “globalization.” Generally, g lobalizatio n is good for everyone.

But it is more benef icial to some than to oth- ers. And currently, the Asians are getting the most out of it. There are three billion people in Asia. And almost every one of them is willing to wo rk for a fraction of the average American wage. Not only that, they tend to save their money, rather than spend it. The savings r ate in China, for example, is said to be nearly 25 percent. In America, it is near zero. Globalization and artif icially low interest rates in America have al- lowe d Asian industries to f lourish. But for every dollar earned by an Asian exporter, 6 cents in debt is added to America’s heavy balance sheet. Things happen that no one particularly wants or especially encour- ages, and the average man goes along with whatever humbug is popular— with no real idea where it leads or why he favors it. Each person plays the role given to him; ever yone believes what he needs to believe to play the part. Alan Greenspan was famously against paper money th at was not backed by gold when he was a liber tarian intellectual. When he became a governm ent functionary, his views conveniently changed. He came to be- lieve what he had to believe in order to be the head of the American em- pire’s central bank: the Federal Reserve. The empire needs almost unlimited amounts of credit to carry out its foreign wars, while making bread and circuses available at home. Alan Gr eenspan mak es sure it gets it. Expensive foreign wars, expensive bread, expensive circuses—these are, of course, what bankrupted almost every empire from Rome to Lon- don. But that is just the point: institutions play their roles, too. One grows; another decays. One is young and dynamic while another is old and decrepit. One has to die to make way for the new one to take its place. One has to ruin itself so that another may f lourish. Americans could cut their mili tary budget b y75percentandstill have theb iggest, most advanced army in the world. They could trim their household spending by half, and still live well.

The main benef iciaries of the pre sent gush of globalization are the Asians. As American consumers turn to Wal- Mart to buy more and more things at “Every-Day Low Prices,” they f ind products from China and Malaysia on the shelves. Were it not for Green span’s low lending rates, they would not have found it so t empting to bor row. Were it not for Greenspans low rates, they would not have found it so alluring to spend. Were it not for Greenspan’s low rates, they would not have bought so much from Asian manufacturers, the Asians would have made less money and would have buil t fewer new factories and trained fewer new workers. Were it not for Greenspan’s lending policies, in other words, Asia would not have grown so quickly and would not now pose such a competitive threat to the rest of the world’s industries. And Am erican s would not owe Asians so much money. In today’s paper for ex- ample, a headline tells the tale: “China joins g lobal race for f astest comput- ers: Beijing and Tokyo aim at a new barrier to overtake U.S. lead.” 4 Asians now own enough U.S. dollar assets to buy a controlling inter- est in every company on the Dow. They have enough T-bonds to destroy the U.S. economy on a whim. Their economic power is growing at three to f ive times the GDP rate of Western nations. So far, they have shown little interest in political power; that is for a later stage of the cycle, an- oth er role for another time. None of these insights are new or original. Most Americans have heard t hese thing s. Longtime readers of our “Daily Reckoning” newsletter (www.dailyreckoning.com) have heard them so often they look for exits when they see your authors coming. But while people know these things to be true, they don’t really believe them. They believe what they need to bel ieve in this late, degenerate stage of the empire. That is, they believe in sloppy fantasies. “T he U.S. economy is still the most dynamic and f lexible in the wo rld,” they tell each other. “We’re the most creative, inventive people on the planet,” they congratulate themselves. “We’ll invent new busi- nesses. We’ll think of som ething!” Th ese vague expressions of faith are probably typical for an advanced empire.

For all we know, we could be facing merely a tempo- rary pullbac kinwha tisstillal ong-term bullish period for the American empire. We have mentioned how present Ameri can attitudes seem more in keeping with the end of a great empire than the beg inning of one. In ad- dition to that, the math of it makes us think we are closer to the end than the debut. The United States pays the direct costs of g lobalizatio n—a mil- itary budget greater than the combined military spending of all of the rest of the world combined. Plus, it bears the indirect costs of its own con- sumerist excesses—another $700 billion or so per year in trade def icit. Together, they represent a c ost of empire of more than 10 percent of GD P...more than $1 trillion each year. Instead of collecting tribute, the United States f inances these costs by borrowing. Here, Alan Greenspan and the paper dollar were immensely helpful. There is no theoretical limit to the amount of debt that can be taken on. The problem is a practical one. The dollar must maintain a rea- sonable value or lenders will be unwilling to lend. Dollar loans must also pay a reasonable amount of interest. With $36 trillion in loans outstand- ing, even at 5 percent interest, that repre sents annual debt service pay- ment s of $1.8 trillion. Who’s got that kind of mon ey? Not Americans; they’re alre ady spending every penny. And the more they spend, the less mon ey they have left to pay interest. All they can do is to ref inance—tak- ing on new debt in order to pay the interest on the old debt. We will not dwell on this, as it is obvious even to an economist that it can’t go on for very long. Sooner or later people cannot continue to borrow and cannot continue to make their payments. Th is reminds us of one of the delusions that has been especially fetching lately. Alan Greenspan tells us that as long as house prices rise in parallel with household debt there should be no problem. He must know that it is not tru e. Relative to his assets, he says, the U.S. consumer is not over indebted. This is a little like telling a man not to worry about drinking too much—as long as he is getting fatter at the same time! The price of a house is only of interest if he is going t oselloutandliveina cave, or die .Otherwise,hehasnowayofrea lizing the inf lated value of his house —exce pt by borrowing against it, which only makes the situa- tion worse."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"18 SLOUCHING TOWARD EMPIRE Am ericans do not seem particularly concerned about their debts. Th ey, like the economists who advise them, come to believe what they mu st. And just as they come to these beliefs as ci rcumstances change—not by pu re th inking—so do they give them up. They continue believing in these fantasies and conceits until they are crushed out of them. Then, and only then, do they take up new beliefs. Currently, Americans still believe in stocks, even though they’ve made not a penny in them for more than six years. Based on past experi- ence, the bear market that began in January 2000 will pr obably continue for another 10 years, taking prices down to six to eight times earnings. Then, their faith in stocks will f inally be crushed out . . . at the very mo- ment stocks are ready for another bull market. Americans also believe that houses always go up in price. No cobwebs grow over a real estate off ice door. No mortgage lender sits by the phone waiting for it to ring. And yet, it is impossible for real estate prices to ex- ceed the rate of GDP growth for very long. This belief will also have to be crushed out, by a long bear market in property. Prices in Rome began a downturn in the year AD 300 or so (this we do not know for a fact, it is just a good guess). They did not stop going down until 1,000 years later ...i n the Re nai ssance ...or maybe l ater. Even as late as the eight eenth century, she ep were grazing where the Forum used to be. The belief in the American empire —in American cultural, political, social, and economic superiority—must also be crushed out somehow. Th at is the likely next phase...the degener ate stage of empire ...which could last one hundred years or more. In summary, the theory we have been teasing out is that politics and mar kets follow similar cyclical patterns—boom, bust, bubble, and bam- boozle. A handful of companies usually take a dominant position in the mar ket; sometimes a single one does. So do a few countries dominate wo rld pol itics...“ empir es” they are called. The difference between a regular nation and an empire is profound. A regular natio n—such as Bel- gium or Bulgaria—tends its own affairs. An empire looks outward, taking on its shoulders the fate of much of the world. An empire is like a bull mar ket. It grows, it develops ...often it passes into a bubble phase, when people come to believe the m ost absurd things.

What will happen next? We don’t know, but we note that people do not give up their self-serving conceits and illusions readily. Th ey hold on to them as long as possible. “America still has the greatest, most dynamic economy on earth,” they tell themselves, even as the nation loses money (its income is less than its expenses). This kind of ma dness is hard not to like; it is like an aging woman who thinks she be- comes more fetching with each passing year. The gap between percep- tion and reality grows wider every day, until f inally, the mirror cracks. What will shatter America’s conf idence is pr obably a co mbination of f inancial crises. The dollar is vulnerable. So are Treasury bonds. So are stocks and house prices. Which one will crack the mirror is anyone’s guess. Our guess is that house prices will stop rising, causing a cutback in consumer spending. This will send the U.S. economy into recession ...pr obably a long, soft slump that will take down house prices and the stock market, but leave the dollar and bonds with little damage. Long suffering readers will f ind this forecast familiar. It is the same one we made two years ago in another book with Addison Wiggin called Financial Reckoning Day (John Wi ley, 2003). We thought then that the tech bubble would blow up, resulting in a long, soft slow slump, à la Japan. Whether we were wrong, or just early, only tomorrow’s newspapers will tell. Instead of a real slump, the United States has had a 9-month phony recession ( in which consumer debt actually expanded ) and a phony boom since ( in which consumer debt actually expanded ). These two phony acts, we believe, set th e stage for a real one—a not-so-soft, maybe not-so- slow, slump. If we we re sure of this forecast we would buy bonds. Since we are un- sure, we buy gold. In the coming real slump, assets of all sorts are likely to be ma rked down—especially those with a debtor on the other side of the transaction. Go ld is wh at people will buy when they start to wonder about the empire ...and its money. We gu ess that they will begin to wonder more and more. “I read in the Figaro that the American economy has become com- pletely dependent on Ch ina,” said a friend at a dinner party recently. “But I guess the Chinese have no choice.

The United States congratulates itself as being the f inest democracy the world has ever seen, but the system for ruling Venice eight centuries ago was also democratic. People voted for people who voted for other peop le, who then voted for yet more people who elected the doge. The whol e idea was to allow ordinary people to believe that they ran the na- tion, while real authority remained in the hands of a few families—the Bu shes, Kennedys, Gores, and Rockefellers of thirt eenth-century Venice. “So easy is it to deceive the multitude,” says Mrs. Oliphant. “The sov- ereignty of Venice, under whatever system carried on, had always been in the hands o facertainn umber of families, who kep ttheirplacewithalmost dynastic regularity undisturbed by any intruders from below—the system of the Co nsiglio Maggiore was still professed to be a representative system of the wid est kind; a nd it would seem at the f irst glance as if all honest men who were da bene and respected by their fellows must one time or other have been secure of g aining admission to that popular parliament.” 2"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Dead Men Talking 25 To M r s.

Making a very long story short, at the beginning of the thirt eenth cent ury, as at the beginning of the twenty-f irst, many people saw a clash of civilizations coming and sharpened their sword s. They were, then as now, th e same civilizations, clashing in about the same part of the wo rld—the Middle East. Wh at was different back then was that the effort to make the world a better place (at least in this episode) was being prodded forward by the French, who were then an expanding, imperial power. St. Louis ( King Louis IX) went on two crusades with a French army and failed both times. Mrs. Oliphant’s history tells of the arrival of six French knights in shining armor, who strode into San Marcos Piazza to ask the doge for help. They were putting together an alliance of civilized Western armies to reconquer Jerusalem, they explained—in the same spirit as King Louis centuries before. They brought out all the usual arguments. But the Venetians were not so muc h convinced by the French as they convinced themselves. They we re, they said to themselves ( just as M adeleine Albright would repeat cent uries later), the “indispensable nation.” Without them, the effort wo uld fail; therefore they must act. Yes, they could still fail, they ac- knowle dged, but look what they had to gain! For not only would they being doing good, but they stood to do well, too—implanting trading posts and ports along the way.

The French protested. They had come to make war against the ene- mies of Christ, not against other Christians. But since they n eeded the Ve n e t i a n s ’ support, they had no choice. In f ive days, the city of Zara surrendered; its defenses were no match forthe armies in frontofthem. An dsothe cityw as sacked and the booty divided up. Soon after came a letter from Pope Innocent III, who won- dered why they were killing fellow Christians; it was the pagans they were m eant t obekilling,her eminded them. He commanded them to leave Zara and proceed to Syria, “neither turning to the right hand nor to the left.” The pope’s letters greatly troubled the pious French, but the Venetians seemed undisturbe d. They ignored the letters and remained in Zara until a new comic opportunity pre sented itself. This time Constantinople was the unfortunate target. A young prince from that city had come to them, asking support for a mission at once as aud acious as it was absurd. His father had been blinded and thrown in a dungeon; the capital of Eastern Christendom was in the hands of men wh o must have been anc estors of Saddam Hussein—evil usurpers, dicta- tors whom the people detested. If the Venetians would come to his aid, he promised, they would be rewarded genero usly. More than that, he and his father would return the entire Eastern Empire back to the one true church of St. Peter in Rome. The Venetians couldn’t resist. In April 1204, they set sail for Bosporus Strait. And in a great battle that must have been an undertaker’s dr eam, they took the city. Historian Edward Gibbon describes the scene: The soldiers who leaped from the galleys on shore immediately as- cended their scaling ladders, while the large ships, advancing more slowing in the intervals and lowering a drawbridge, opened a way through the air from their masts to the rampart. In the midst of the conf lict the doge’s venerable and conspicuous form stood aloft in com- plete armor on the prow of his galley. The great standard of St. Mark was displayed before him; his threats, promises and exhortations urged the diligence of the rowers; this v essel was the f irst that struck; and Dandolo [the doge] was the f irst warrior on shore.

Like the intelligence services’ warnings of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, his depiction of the circumstances prevailing in Constantinople at the time was inaccurate. Much of it seemed fanciful. Though the initial conquest was fairly easy and glorious, sub sequent event s were less so. The local population rose up against the invaders. The city had to be retaken; this time, the battle was bloodier, and thousands of innocent citizens were put to the sword. As near as historians can tell, the Venetians earned no lasting gain or ben efit. Dandolo died in 1205, never having set foot in his homeland again. As for his co mpatriots, what was left of them eventually returned to Venice. “B ut there still remains in Venice,” adds Mrs. Oliphant, “one striking eviden ce of the splendid, disastrous expedition, the unexampled conquests and victories yet dismal end, of what is called the Fourth Crusade. And that is the four great bronze horses, curious, inappropriate bizarre orna- ments that stand above the doorways of San Marco. This was the blind doge’s lasting piece of spoil.” 4 “B een there.

We are the cleverest humans who have ever lived, right? Maybe. But if we could convene a council from the spirit world and invite the dead to have their say, what would the corpses tell us? Ve ni et vidi. Gaze on the dead, and learn their secrets. No one seem stoc are abo ut dead people. No stockbrokers ask for their business. No politicians pander for their votes. No one cares what they think or what they may have learned before they shucked their mortal shell. They get no respect, just a quick sen d-off, and then they are o ntheir own. What did the old-timers know of war? Of politics? Of love? Of mon ey? If only we could ask! Ye arsa go, investors wanted more from a stock than just the hope that s omeone might come along who was willing to pay more for it. They wa nted a stock that paid a dividend out of earnings. When heard about a stock ,theyasked:“Howmuchdoesitpay?”Thatwaswhatin- vesting was all about. But by the 1990s, the old-timers on Wall Street had almost all died off. Stock buyers no longer cared how much the company earned or how large a dividend it paid. All they cared about was that some greater fool would come along and take the stock off their hands at a higher price. And the fools rushed in. And now the market is full of greater and greater fools wh o think the stock market is there to make them rich. What would the old-timers think of them? And what would our dead ancestors think of our mortgages? Most of them had small mortgages, if any at all, on their homes. And i ftheyhad them, the ycouldn’twaittogetridofth em.

He explained why America n eeded a consti tution: “The general ob ject was t oproduceacurefortheevilsunder wh ich theU nited States l abored; that in tracing these evils to their origins, every man had found it in the turbulence and follies of democracy.” 5"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"30 IMPERIA ABSURDUM Another dead man, James Madison, made it even clearer: “Democra- cies,” he wrote, “have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their death.” 6 So,w eleave you “a Republic, if you can keep it,” added Ben Franklin. We l l, we couldn’t keep it. Now, we have a curious empire, with a constitution as f lexible as its money. Everybody gets a vote in this new democratic Valhalla.

The past may be imperfectly understood, but it is the only reference we have. Why not take a look at it? Why not shake the dust off a dead man and get his opinion? Why not venture into the land of the dead to ask some questions? “T he state’s need of mon ey increased rapidly,” writes a dead man, Bresciani-Turoni, describing the scene in Germany 80 years ago. “Private banks, besieged by their clients, found it impossible to meet the demand for money.” 7"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Dead Men Talking 31 As the situation heated up in the summer of 1923, there were some old-timers who gave advice: “Less,” they said. Bu to fficialsw ere in roughly the same situation as Ben Bernanke, Alan Greenspan, and George Bush today. “More,” said they. They feared the economy might fal lintotroub le unless they made more cash and cre dit avai lable. One, named Helferrich, the f inance minister in Germany’s Weimar Re public, ex plained: To follow the good counsel of stopping the printing of notes would mean—as long as the causes which are upsetting the German exchange continue to operate—refusing to give economic life to the circulating me dium necessary for transactions, payments of salaries and wa ges, and so on, it would mean that in a very short time the entire public, and abo ve all the Reich, could no longer pay merchants, employees, or wo rkers. In a few weeks, besides the printing of notes, factories, mines, railwa ys and post off ice, national and local governments, in short, all national and economic life would be stopped. 8 When an economy comes to depend on more and more credit, it must get more and more of it or that economy will come to a stop. A man who has borrowed heavily to f inance a lifestyle he cannot afford must continue bor rowing to keep up appearances. Or else he must stop. In market ma- nias, love, politics, or war, people rarely stop until they are forced to. In 1921, a dollar would buy 276 marks. By August 1923, it would buy 5 million of them. Middle-class savers were wiped out. If only we could roust Herr Helferrich from his eternal sleep! We have some questions we would like to put to his wormy cadaver.

What fun it wo uld be to show him what his policies—the same, by and large, as are now put forward by Greenspan, Bernanke, and Bush—provoked. How gratifying it would be to see the little kraut squirm under an intense in- terrogation: What was he thinking, after all? Why did he think that more of the dreadful printing press money would undo the harm that had al- ready been done by too much?

It was a distressing preoccupation and constant torment of innumerable fami- lies ; it poisoned the German people by spreading among all classes the spirit of speculation and by diverting them from proper and regular wo rk, and it was the cause of incessant political and moral distur- bance. It is indeed easy enough to understand why the record of the sad years 1919–1923 always weighs like a nightmare on the German people. 9 Sure ly some special corner of Hell is reserved for central bankers. Ben Strong. John Law. They are probably all down there. Maybe Charles Ponzi is with them. What do they do down there? Play cards, perhaps. He lferrich must be there too—roasting.

If only we could talk to them! Didn’t they sacrif ice their souls, and do they not now writhe in eternal torment? And for what? Why should God ma ke a moral example out of them if no one pays attention? Every central banker in the world has taken the devil’s bait, creating money, out of thin air, as if no one were looking. As if it had not been tried b efore. As if they could get away with it and people really could get som ething for nothing! And yet, they all seem unable to do any- thi ng different—even with the threat of scorching their fat derrieres in the afterlife. SECRETS OF TH E NE AR DEAD If the dead have secrets, what about those who are almost dead? We r e ad an interview with Sir John Templeton. The great old man said he t houg ht shares and houses in America were too expensive and that the United States was cruising for trouble with its trade def icit and U.S. federal def icit. He said he anticipated a long bear market in shares, falling residential real est ate prices and a serious slump in the economy. Implic- itly, he advised investors to hold cash. 10"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Dead Men Talking 33 The person who wrote the article then asked local analysts and stock- brokers what they thought of Templeton’s opinion. One chal lenged Tem- pleton’s competence, saying that becau se of his advanced age (Templeton was 92), he might be “out of touch” with current thinking. Templeton was not even dead yet, and already they were shoveling the mud on his face. But being out of touch is precisely what made his opinions valuable. We like old things. Old buildings. Old ideas. Old trees. Old rules. Old investors. The older the investor, the more conf idence we have in him. He has seen good times and bad tim es. He has seen bulls and bears. People who have been around for a long time have had an opport unity to see several cycles. An American born after 1960, on the other hand, barely came of age when the 1982 to 2002 boom began. He has never seen a sustained bear market or a period when the nation was downcast or des- perate. Templeton was a young man when Wall Street crashed in 1929. He was an adult in the Great Depression. He recalls the dark days of Wo r l d Wa r I I, when it looked as though the allies might lose. During his life span, there have been booms and busts, m ass murders, the worst wars in history, famines, hyperinf lation, and national bankruptcies. Dozens of currencies and at least f ive empires have gone defun ct. Dozens of coups and rev olutions have taken place. Ideologies have come and gone. Thou- sands of banks and businesses have gone bust. Prominent careers have been ruined and reputations lost. A man who has seen so much and still has his wits about him is a great treasure. If he is still solvent, that is even better. Somehow, he must have avoided the bad ideas, bad investments, and bad advice. Innovations are like genetic mutations. Most of them are mistakes. Most fail. Old people tend to reject new ideas, new styles, and new things. This is not simply because these dogs are too old to learn new tricks. What the oldsters know—from experience—is that the new tricks are pr obably not wort h learning. What we have around us are only the innovations that succeeded. Compani es, products, ideas, governments, clubs, styles—all that we see are the successful ones. The unsuccessful innovations—thou- sands and thousands of them—all disappeared. Even wildly successful innovations, such as heavier-than-air f light, are not successful for ever yon e.

With the Internet, he can get all he wa nts. What he lacks is the “high-proof ” distilled information—the wisdo m—that comes with age. Mr. Taleb continues, “A preference for distilled thinking implies fa- voring old investors and traders, that is, investors who have been exposed to markets the longest, a matter that is counter to the Wall Street practice of preferring those that have been the m ost prof itable and preferring the you nger whenever possible . . .” 12 Testing the proposition using a mathematical model, Taleb “found a signif icant advantage in selecting aged traders, using, as a selection crite- rion, their cumulative years of experience rather than their absolute suc- cess ( conditiona l on their having survived without blowing up).” 13 Distilled information tends to be expressed as moral interdictions.

DEAD PRESIDENTS David M. Walker, Comptroller General of the United States, clarif ied America’s debt situation in late 2004: “The Federal government’s g ross debt—the accumulation of its annual def icits—was about $7 trillion last Septem ber, wh ich wo rks out to about $24,000 for every man, woman, and c hild in the country,” he announced. “But that number excludes items like the g ap between the government’s Social Security and Medicare commitm ents and the money put aside to pay for them. If these items are factored in, the burden for every American rises to well over $100,000.” We a dd to Walker’s lament: As we will see, $7 trillion is chicken feed. The real debt is far higher. Plus, one out of every four dollars spent by the federal government is borrowed. And for every dollar that comes in the door from income tax es, the feds borrow another 80 cents. Economists used to worry about government using up the nation’s savings. But now Americans have no more savings to use. Still, the nation that can’t save a dime sets out to save the entire planet. The cost is as monumental as the project. Taking out Social Security surpluses, federal def icits are expected to be about a half trillion dollars each year for the next 10 years—or $5 trillion in total ( half of gross do- mestic product, or GDP). We put no exclamation point following that last sentence, because the numbers shriek without one. Still, America’s econ- om ists are deaf to the problem, just as its policymakers are dumb to any solution. After all, in the words of Dick Cheney: “Def icits don’t matter.” Meanwhile, the private sector also has been r unning up immense deb ts. In 2005, for every $19 Americans earned, they spent $20. This dif- ference was recorded in the trade def icit f igures, measuring the speed at wh ich Americans raced down the road to ruin. Top speed as of this writ- ing was $58.3 billion. That was the f igure for January 2005 when the na- tion was clocked overspending at a rate of almost $2 billion per day. It was the difference between what Americans sold to foreigners in the month of"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"36 IMPERIA ABSURDUM January and what they bought from them. It was a negative number. On a chart of the nation’s accounts, it would be in red. Or in brackets. Or pre- ceded by a minus sign. If it were divided among the nation’s families, it would come to about $600 for each one. This repre sents o nly a single month’s trade def icit, so we shou ld mu ltiply it by 12 to get the measure of damage on an annual basis: $7,200 per family per year. Compared with the average family’s in- come, it is such a big number that we wondered if we had done the arith- metic correctly. On a macroeconomic scale, the shortfall was rising to 6 percent of GDP. In the old days of the gold standard, the nation on the plus side of this exchange would pile up its excess foreign currency and take it to the other nation’s central bank. Gold was the common reference and an uncommon restrain t. It was real money. If a nation ran out of gold, it ran out of money. It could no lon ger borrow. It could no longer run trade def icits, because when the foreign currencies were presented to it, it would have no means of settling up. It would have to declare bankruptcy, which hap- pened from time to time. But it has been 34 years since the U nited States settled its overseas ob- ligations in gold. Since then, it has found it far easier to offer U.S. dollar- den om inated Treasury bonds. Remarkably, the foreigners have accepted them as if they were as good as gold. More remarkably, for most of that time the bonds were not only as good as gold—they were better. Gold fell in price for two decades following Ronald Reagan’s f irst presidential elec- tion. Overseas central bankers took the Treasury bonds and felt grateful, even lucky, to have them. The United States was just too lucky. It could spend without really paying. It could borrow without ever really paying back. It could dig itself into such a deep hole of debt, it could f ind no easy way out. Among the noisy headlines of 2005 was the remarkable information that China—a Third World nation—lends the United States $300 billion per year. Without Chinese support, the dollar would have already col- lapsed, bond yields would have soared, and the U.S. economy would be in a recession, if not a depression. Wh ered oes the money come from?

China is fast becoming America’s “company store,” to whom we owe our standard of living and maybe even our soul. By the end of 2004, two cent ral banks—Japan and China—held almost a trillion dollars’ worth of U.S. Treasury bonds. On their willingness to save and to recycle savings into U.S. Treasury bonds stood the U.S consumer economy. A single wo rd from either central bank could send the U.S. economy into a severe slump: sell. And thus comes an even more remarkable curiosity: “In an era of free trade,” began a complaint from Treasury Secr etary John Snow, “we should not have to co nfront the issue of countries dis- torting their currencies to gain unfair trade advantages.” The specif ic country to which Snow referred was China. The trade adv antage the latter en joyed was that it sold much more to the U nited States than the United States sold to it, by a ratio of 5 to 1. And the unfair distortion was that China pegged its own currency to the dollar. In the spring of 2005, the exchange was called “manipulation”; the United States demanded that China revalue by 10 percent. Ho w were the Chinese manipulating the yuan? By f ixing it to the imperial currency! Oh, that was clever, wily, diabolical. The Chinese in- sisted on maintaining their 10-year-old policy of pegging the yuan to the dollar. The United States counts on a steady devaluation of its money. It buys from overseas and pays in dollars. Then, in effect, it prints up more dollars to replace those it has shipped overseas. The resulting inf lation of the currency—ref lected in the increase in prices of oil, gold, and other in- ternat ionally traded goods—is a form of imperial trib ute. It is America’s only way of making the empire pay. As the dollar goes do wn, the trillions of dollars held in foreign accounts become less valuable. An “exorbitant privilege,” said Charles de Gaulle. But the Chinese refused to play along. As the dollar went down, so did their yuan. Instead of raising prices on Chinese goods and lowering the va lue of Chines e dollar holdings relative to its own currency, every- thi ng remained even. The Chinese weren’t paying their tribute. Americans were indignant.

Bush administration off icials gave the Chinese a deadline to shape up. In the summer of 2005, the Chinese f inally an- nounced that they were giving up the dollar peg, or at least widening “the channel” a little. But the problem was never caused by China. An entire American generation has grown up being told that it could spend its way to prosperity. Snow, McTeer, Greenspan, Bernanke—they all still believe it. Debt is no problem, they say. Spend, spend, spend. American spending created a boom in China, where the average per- son works in a sweatshop, lives in a hovel, and saves 25 percent of his earn- ings. Am erican s had come to believe there was som ething unfair about China’s trade practices, that they must be stealing jobs with a distorted currency, instead of competing for them fair and square. Meanwhile, in the United States, the average man lives in a house he can’t pay for, drives a car he can’t afford, and waits for the next shipment from Ho ng Kong for distractions he can’t resist. He saves nothing and be- lieves th e Chinese will lend him money forever, on the same terms. That this cannot go on forever hardly seems wort h pointing out. Whether it will go on much longer, we cannot say. But that it will end badly seems a cinch. We can barely wait to f ind out how it all turns out. Maybe a year from now . Ma ybe 2...5...10 years.

There are “good” empir es. And bad ones. There are ones in which the imperialists get rich and others in which they become very poor . There are some in which the imperium functions with the brute elegance of a guillotine; in others, the complexities and subtleties baff le historians. But among all the empires that have come and gone, the U.S. imperium stands out as the most absurd. The absurdity arises at the most basic level. Seeking to deceive, the Ivy League Alexanders and the Plain State Caesars deceived themselves more than anyone. From the very beg inning, they knew not what business they were in. We can enjoy a superior chuckle at the screwball humbug of it. Histo- rians of the future are likely to get cramps from laughing.

At the risk of spoiling a great joke, we will explain it. The typical pro- gram for imperial f inance is simple. The imperial power, the imperium, provides—at its own initiative—a public good; it extends security and order. In return, the groups that benef it pay tribute. The imperium shou ld not merely breakeven; it should make a prof it. Living standards in the homeland should rise, compared with those in vassal st ates.

America provides a pax dollarium for nearly th e entire world. But the United States does not take direct tribute from its vassal states and de- pendent territories for providing this service. In stead, it borrows from them. Living standards rise in the United States. But they are rising on bor rowe d money, not on stolen money. The big difference is that Amer- ica’s vassal states can stop lending at any time. If they care to, they can even dump their current loans on the open market destroying the U.S. dollar and forcing interest rates so high that a recession—or depression— is practically guaranteed. What is worse, the longer the pre sent system continues, the worse off Americans are. The closer you look at it, the larger the absurdity becomes. In the f irst half of 2005, Americans got poorer, not richer—at the rate of $80 million per hour. Their system of imperial f inance was impoverishing them. Even that is not the worst of it, because it also reduced their ability to compete in the modern economic world. While they were providing a public good—at a loss—their competitors were saving money, building capital and expertise, setting up factories, and taking market share away from the m. Each year, Asians produce more of what Americans buy, and Amer- icans produce less of what a nyone b uys. Products leave Asia for North America. Money leav es North America for Asia. The money comes back to America within days. America’s econ- om ists breathe easy. What is there to worry about, they ask, as long as it com es back to us. “It is a form of tribute,” they claim; the empire wo rks. But it works in a perverse way. The money th at comes back is not the same as the mon ey that left. It has been transformed: It goes out as an asset and comes back as a liability. THE HUNS ARE COMING!

The barbarian invasions of Europe had their bright side. The barbar- ians were in thei r expansion phase—their bull market stage—with rising expectations and positive, bullish hopes. They were getting som ething, not for nothing, but for next to nothing. What was the effort of killing a man compared with the wealth it brought the killer? A small investment. A trif le really, and an enjoyable one for many people. But conquest was not without risk. There are no completely free lunches, even for thieves and murderers. The Huns took a risk. On the upside were booty, women, slaves—and the pure exhilaration of battle and the prestige of conquest. On the downside, they might be defeated and killed. Th e Hun might have been a sell signal for civilization, but he was a buy signal for his own fortunes, his status, his group, his empire, and his genes. It was a time to be “long” politics: There is a time to plant, to reap, and to trade with others peaceably. And there is a time for force, for tak- ing wh at you want without paying for it and for killing anyone who gets in your way, for the Hunnish invasions meant rape, not for sweet talk and courtship.

Since the time of theR om ans, it has been fashionable to put a civilized mask on your face when you put the imperial purple on your back. You are bringing religion to the heathen. You are bringing civilization to the indigenes. You are bringing culture, education, and technology. Even Alexander the Great thought he was doing the wo rld a favo r. Conquerors do not like to admit—even to themselves—that their instincts are no diffe rent from those o fbarbarians.Th ey have better table manners. But they are subject to thesam eu rges as Genghis or Attila. Bloodl ust, prestige, power, status— who can deny that it would be a thril ltoconquerawholecityoranen- tire nation? But empire builders typically put on the imperial purple like a setofangel’s wings, leap offthe balcony, and come down with a thud. Genghis Khan needed no m ask. The man showed his face as it really was. He united the Mongolian tribes in about 1129 and beginning with a series of attacks on northern China, he embarked on a spectacular epic of mass sl aug hter and rapine from which two empires were derived. One of them, the Ottoman Empire, lasted until the end of World War I. The Mon gol hordes overran northern China, Tibet, Persia, nearly all of central Asia and the Caucasus, Korea, Burma, Vietnam, Anatolia, and much of Russia. They attacked India and eventually, in 1526, Babar, one of Genghis Khan’s descendants, set himself up as emperor of the place. In China, too, Genghis’s descendants founded the Y uan dynasty, which ruled until nearly the f ifteenth century."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Empires of Dirt 43 All empires have to pay, in one way or another. The Mongols made theirs pay in the most elemental, and probably m ost satisfying, way. From an evolutionary point of view, all human activity has a single purpose—to propagate on e’s genes. A man tries to get rich or get electe d to demon- strate that he is the sort of fellow a woman would want to mate; he will produce offspring as capable as he is; and he has the resources to take care of them. In this sense, history records no more spectacular success than the great Genghis Khan. At one point, Genghis was told by his generals that the swee test pleas- ure in life was falconry. “No,” the empire builder is said to have replied, “You are mistaken. Man’s greatest good fortune is to chase and defeat his enemy , seize his total possessions, leave his married women weeping and wa iling, ride his geldin g and use the bodies of his women as a nightshirt and support.” 1 Genghis was so succ essful that a recent DNA study of 2,123 men from across Asia permitted sc ientists to estimate that he may have as many as 16 million male descendants spread out from Manchuria to Afghanistan. Genghis made the empire pay in another way, too. He imposed a rough income tax tribute on all his subject peoples. The rate was only 10 percent—considerably less barbaric than today’s rates. Now that Mongolia is free from Soviet rule, its citizens are beginning to take a renewed interest in the man so many of them can trace as an an- cestor. “Within this rapidly changing world, Genghis Kh an, if we ac- knowle dge him without bias, can serve as a moral anchor. He can be Mongolia’s root, its source of certainty at a time wh en many things are uncertain.” 2 We q u o te that passage from the Ha rvard Asia Pacific Review me rely to embarrass Professor Tsetsenbileg, of the Mongolian Ac ademy of Sci- ences, who said it. Genghis Khan may be popular in Mongolia, but it just rais es questions about the Mongolians. “Al l who surrender will be spared; whoever does not surrender but oppo ses with struggle and dissension, shall be annihilated,” 3 said Genghis before attacking the ancient cities of Bukhara and Samarkand. It has been estimated that his campaigns killed as many as 40 million people based on census data of the times: Genghis Khan preferred to of fer opponents the chance to submit to his rule without a f ight, but was merciless if he encountered any resistance."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"44 IMPERIA ABSURDUM Genghis Khan’s conquests were chara cterized by wholesale destruction on unp recedented scale and radically changed the demographics in Asia. According to the works of Iranian historian Rashid al-Din, Mon gols killed over 70,000 people in Merv and more than a million in Nishapur. China suffered a drastic decline in population. Before the Mon gol invasion, China had about 100 million inhabitants; after the comp lete conquest in 1279, the census in 1300 showed it to have roughly 60 million people. How many of these deaths were attributable directly to Genghis and his forces is unclear. 4 But those were also the days when a man lied to exaggerate his mur- ders, rather than cover them up. Genghis Khan was proud of killing peo- ple. In a way, he should have been; he did it so well. But how could so few have done so much to so many? The entire population of Mongolia could not have exceeded about 200,000 persons. Military historians argue that it was largely because the Mongols were so bloo dthirsty, so merciless, so fanatical, so fast, and so lethal that they were hard to stop. They were superb horsemen, frequently without infantry support, who were able to move more quickly than their more sedentary enemies much like panzer div isions in World War II. Their ghazi was a forer unner of today’s jihad. Their composite bows were like today’s Kalashnikovs (a Russian-made rif le that can f ire bullets continuously). And they had a sophisticated system of communications that inc luded sema phorelike information exchange on the battlef ield and a pony express relay of “arrow riders” shooting across the prairies. With these advantages, they took what they wanted and killed everyone who got in their way. It was not a very polite way to run an empire, but it worked. Genghis died in 1227. His son Ogedei was electe d to succeed him. Those who think democracy deters state violence do not bother to talk to the dead: Mussolini, Hitler, and Ogedei Khan all won off ice, at least in part, thanks to the ballot box. After his election victory, Ogedei Khan continued his father’s expansion. He pushed farther into northeastern Asia and conquered Korea and northern China. By the time of his sudden death in 1241, his armies were on the frontier of Egypt and pre sent-day Poland. But democracy cut them off. Mongol law required that the new Kh an be chosen by a new vote of Genghis’s descendants. Were it not for thi s inter ruption, the Mongol armies might have pushed beyond the Rhine and thrown Europe into a new Dark Age. As it turned out, by the"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Empires of Dirt 45 time the Mon gols had chosen a new leader—Genghis’s grandson, Mon gka—the momentum in Europe had been l ost. In 1257, the Mongols turned toward Baghdad. Hulagu, another grandson of Genghis, demanded that the caliph of Baghdad, al-Muta’sim, receiveh im as his sovereign, just as he had done with the Seljuk Turks when they swept over the area. But the caliph of Baghdad was the 37th of theA bbasid dynasty and leader of Muslims throughout the Middle East. He believed that his people would come to his aid against the inf idel. They did not, and Hula gu marched on B aghdad wit hanarmyofhun- dreds of thousands of cavalry, wiping out the old Assassin fortress at Ala- mut o nhisway. The caliph realized his mistake. He offered Hulagu the title of “Sul- tan.” Hulagu’s name would be given at Friday prayers in all the mosques of Baghdad, he added. Later, the caliph went in person to see Hulagu. This time, he said his citizens would lay down their arms if the Mongols wo uld spare their lives. But as soon as their swords and bows had been col- lected, the Muslim f ighters were exterminated. Then the Mongols went to work on the civilians. Eighty thousand men, women, and children were massacred. The caliph was strangled. The only peop le not killed in Baghdad were the Christians. Mongka Khan’s mother was a Nestorian Christian. At one point, perhaps at her urging, the Mongols sent emissaries to the King of the Franks, who was then fighting theirm utual enemies—the Muslims—in the Holy Lands. The Mongols offered to turn to Christ, but his suggestion seems to have been ignored so he turned East, instead of West. Mongka Khan died just as his armies wer e about to attack Cairo. The next Khan, Kublai, moved the Mon gol court to Beijing and founded the Yuan dynasty. Som ething about the Baghdad area m ust attract empire builders the way a beehive attracts bears. Only a few miles away is the site of anc ient Ctesi phon—a city that was taken and retaken at l east 36 times before it was f inally destroyed after the Saracens took it in AD 637. The Romans took the place f ive times, three times in the second century alone. Before that, the Hittites, Akkadians, Persians, Parthians, Sassanids, Macedonians, and countless others had already left their sandalprints between the Tigris and Euphrates. Emperor Trajan captured Ctesi phon in AD 116 and made it part of Rome. The next year, Hadri an gave it back to the Parthians in a peace set- tlem ent. In 164, it was again taken, by Roman general Avidius Cassius,"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"46 IMPERIA ABSURDUM but later abandoned. Then, Septimus Severus f inally made the campaigns pay when he took the city in 197. He sold as many as 100,000 of the city’s citizens into slavery. A hundred years later, the city was again in the news. Emperor Ga- lerius was defeated outside the city walls by an army of Persians. In 296, he sought a rematch and this time won the city, which he traded for Ar- me nia. Much later, in 627, Heraclius, took the city. The Western Empire was already history, but Heraclius ruled brief ly from Constantinople. He gave up the city soon after its capture. Ten years later, it fell to the Sara- cens and was soon in ruins. A British army was defeated by Ottoman forces in 1915, but regained title to the city in the Treaty of Versailles. Later, the British readily let go of Baghdad, after they realized how ex- pensive it was to hold on to the place. It gained its independence along with other British imperial possessions in 1921. More recently, the city was once again taken by American forces. WHERE HAVE ALL THE DEAD EMPIRES GONE? Of all the silly things people said to ward the end of the twentieth century, perhaps the silliest came out of the mouth of Francis Fukuyama. The man was so infatuated by the apparent success of the American imperium, he believed th e “end of history” might have arrived. What is the history of this tattered ball but the record of the rise an d fall of civilizations, of gov- ernments, of battles and heroes? But so perfect in Fukuyama’s eyes was the new American empire, he thought it had risen be yond the tug of gravity. So, solidly launched w as the rocket of democratic capitalism that he could not imagine that it would ever fall to earth. Nor could he fathom how anything could ever compete with it or take its place. 5 Fukuyama did not seem to appreciate how history wo rks. Politics, like markets and love affair s, often throws up periods of relative contentment, as well as sour periods of despair and bubbles of temporary insanity. If they last for more than a generation, people think they are permanent. In the case of bubbles, people believe that some new era has arrived and that thi ngs will never be as they were before. Bubble markets—such as the tech bubble in the late 1990s or the resi dential property bubble in certain areas of the United States in 2004 and 2005— come along from time to time.

In the famous Tulip Bubble in Holland from 1634 to 1637, people paid up to 5,000 guilders for a single tulip bulb. In the South Sea Bubble in England, in 1711, speculators paid up to 1,000 pounds for stocks that were reduced to nothing by the latter half of 1720. In the Japa- nese Bub ble of the late 1980s, investors paid such high prices for real estate in downtown Tokyo that the grounds of the Imperial Palace were said to be wort h more than the entire state of California. Investors pay extravagant prices because they are convinced that some- thi ng fundamental has changed and that they will never again have an op- portunity to buy at current prices, no matter how high they have become. They believe the world will never be the same, that the rules that govern human activity have been altered or suspended. Markets make opinions, the ol d-timers say. It is an expression we re- turn to several times in this book. As prices rise, people invent explana- tions fo r why they have gone up and they will continue. In the case of the tech bubble of the late 1990s, they told themselves that new dev elopments in electronic communications had completely changed the ancient rela- tionships. Thanks to computer-driven devices and the Internet, material progress was about to accelerate. Assets were about to get much more valuable. It did not bother them that the two propositions were contradic- tory. A society in which the future comes faster should logically depreci- ate the present more quickly. Factori es, means of production, and capital assets should be expected to become obsolete sooner and thus should be wo rth less, not more. But no one thinks very hard when markets are ris- ing. This is true of the real estate bubble on both coasts in 2004 and 2005. Hous es in Southern California were increasing in value at four times the rate of gross domestic product (GDP) growth and an inf initely great mul- tiple of real income growth—which was negative. It made no sense, but wh o mentioned it? Prices were rising; investors had no trouble coming up with reasons. It was a new era, they said; property would never again be worth wh at it used to be. In politics, too, there are bubbles—times when the horizon is so clear and cloudless, people begin to think it will never rain again. The old prin- ciples—the wisdom of the dead and the virtues that brought them to wh ere they are—no longer matter. It is a new era. They are the imperial powe r, the hegemon, the cock of the walk.

They look in the mirror and think they see a race so clever, virtuous, sturdy, and industrious that they deserve to be on top of the world. Surely, they have created som ething that can never be matched. All of history has been marching toward this perfection. Time has stopped. History has come to an end; there is no need for any more of it. In 1989, American democratic imperialism tr iumphed unmistakably against its adversary— the Evil Empire. The Good Empire was the last one standing. God had shined hi s light on us and would never turn it off. Many peop le said many dumb things in the twentieth century. Usu- ally, they were only mistakes or lies. When Neville Chamberlain said we wo uld have “peace in our time,” he was making a prediction. He was wr ong. But if you hung everyone who guessed wrong about the future, the lampposts and traff ic lights of Wall Street would be full of bodies. And when Adolph Hitler said Germany needed lebensraum, he w as merely covering up his desire for conquest by putting on a mask. But when, after the Berlin Wall fell and Francis Fukuyama declared the end of history, he must have made the gods chuckle. Here was a ref lection so vain and im- becilic, it practically cracked mirrors. It was as if Fukuyama never actually read any history. Empires are liv- ing things. They are born; they must die, too. No one conquers without eventually being conquered. No bubble expands without eventually blow- ing up. Th ere are no exceptions. All empires die. Here, for amusement, we loo k at the gravestones (see Table 2.1). Only one, and that one of rela- tively recent naissance, still lives. But the grave and the tombstone are ther e, waiting for it. Fukuyama’s concept was that the desire for power, glory, conqu est, revenge—all th e dark forces of destruction and regression—had disap- peared. They had been replaced by an evolving civilization of consensual, dem ocra tic government and market-driven material progress, led by an enlightened U.S. imperium.

And here we offer readers a history of the rise and fall of the world’s greatest empire as brief as the l atest I talian underpants. THE ROMAN EMPIRE In the eighth century BC ,Rome w as nothing more than a collection of vil- lages along the Tiber, inhabited by several tribes, principally Latin, Sabine,"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"50 IMPERIA ABSURDUM and Etruscan. Gradually, these Romans grew in numbers and power, and went to war with almost everyone. They were already constructing an empire before the f ifth century BC . In a celebrated early incident, perhaps only legendary, they invited their neighbors, the Sabines, to a feast and then stole their women. The Sabine men were not happy; they took offense and nursed a grudge. But there was hardly a tribe, kingdom, or empire in Eu- rope, North Africa, or the Middle East with whom the Romans did not pick a f ight. After the Sabine war, there were wars against the Albii, Etr- uscans, Volcii, Carthaginians, Etruscans again, the Latin League (and this is only a partial list), the Volsquii, Equii, Veieii, Gauls, Samnites, more Gauls, Epirians, Carthaginians again, and more Gauls, Macedonians, Syrians, Macedonians again, slaves in Sicily, Parthians—and even Romans in the civil wars. And we have not even arrived at Caesar’s wars against the Gauls in 58 to 51 BC .R om an history has another 500 years of wars to go! The civil wars in the f irst century BC put an end to the Republic. Then, Caesar crossed the Rubicon, and it was a new era in Rome. It was as if Tommy Franks had dec ided to move his army to Washington, DC, and make a regime change of his own. Some people would object, of course (the liberal papers would howl), but most people wouldn’t care. In ancient Rome, as in modern Washington, people chose their ideas the same way they chose their clothes—they wanted som ething that not only did the job, but was also fashionable. And at the time, it was à la mode for emp erors and individuals alike to pretend they lived in a free re- public that honored citizens’ rights. But in practice, the government, and its leader, could get away with almost an ything. And what they seemed to like doing was going out and making war against everyone they thought they could beat. That is what Empires do. Back then, war was a paying proposition. When Emperor Trajan took Ctesi phon (near modern Baghdad ), he captured 100,000 people who were sold into slavery. When Augustus took Egypt, he used the Nile’s wheat harvest to feed the growing population of rabble in Rome. Bu tw hile some peop le came out ahead, in the aggregate, wars then— as now—w eren egative gain enterprises. And as the empire grew, the costs also mou nted,tot he point where both became grotesque and insupportable. Octavian, under the name Augustus, was installed in 27 BC .TheRo- ma ns only used pure gold and silver coins, but Augustus needed more mone ytof inance his wars and domestic improvements.

Nor was there a global bond market, from which he could raise billions in loans overnight. All he c ould do was to order the government- owned mines in Spain and Fra nce t oworkovertime.Aroundtheclock, miners dug out the precio us metals. The money supply rose. As the supply of som ething rises relative to the supply of something else, the value of the former declines relative t othelatter.Thus,didpricesriseinRomeasmore money chased the same quantity of consumer goods. Between the day Au- gustus came to power and the day Jesus Christ was born—a period of 27 years—consumer prices ne arly do ubled. Augustus, or his advisors, realized the prob lem. They cut back the money supply and prices stabilized. Rome wasn’t built in a day, nor was its money destroyed overnight. In AD 64, in Nero’s reign, the aureus was reduced by 10 percent of its we ight. Thereafter, whenever the Romans n eeded more mon ey to f inance their wars, their public improvements, their social welfare services and circuses, and their trade def icits, they reduced the m etal content of the coins. By the time Odoacer deposed the last emperor in 476, the silver den arius contained only 0.02 percent silver. THE INVI NCIBLE ARMADA Th e impulse to build up an empire seems to be as strong as the impulse to tear one down. To the question, when does a country aim for empire, com es the answer: whenever it can. Every country in Europe has at one time or another reached for the imperial purple. Portugal and Spain discovered and conquered vast jun- gles, swamps, and pampas, and built empires for themselv es. For Spain, the conquests were extremely prof itable after they found huge quantities of gold and silver. But nothing ruins a nation faster than easy money. The mon ey supply grew larger with every ship’s return from the New World. Peop le felt rich, but prices soon soared. Worse, the easy money from the new territories undermined honest industry. In the bubble economy of the early sixteenth century, Sp ain dev eloped a trade def i cit similar to that of the United States today. People took their money and bought goods from abroad. By the time the New World mines petered out, the Spanish were bankrupt. The Spanish government defaulted on its loans in 1557, 1575, 1607, 1627, and 1647. Not only was the damage severe, it was long- lasting. The Iberian Peninsula became the “sick man of Europe” and re- mained on bed rest until the 1980s."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"52 IMPERIA ABSURDUM If empires are to endure, they m ust pay. But if they pay too well, suc- cess ruins the homeland. In the summer of 1588, the Invincible Armada of King Philip II of Spain he aded toward the Low Countri es. You and I, dear reader, can spot the error already. Philip would have done better to call his f leet the “Al- most Invincible Armada,” or perhaps even better, the “Best Little Armada We Co uld Put Together at the Time.” Calling an armada invincible is like calling a WorldCom unbeatable; it is a challenge to the gods and an invi- tation to destruction. The Armada’s mission was simple, but not easy—to pick up soldiers in the Neth erlands and transport them to England. It had been 500 years since anyone had att empted an invasion of England. The l ast assault, led by Wi lliam, Duke of Normandy, had been a big succ ess. Philip was ready to have a go at it again. The reasons for the campaign were not so simple. In the jargon of today, he might have labeled his effort a “War on Terror,” for English pir ates had been terrorizing Spanish shipping for years. The pir ates were not necessarily sponsored by the English crown. But they, literally, found safe harbor in En- glish ports, similar to the way al-Qaida found Afghanistan hospitable. Of course, there was more to it. Religion played a part. Just as George Bu sh’s War on Terror has a subtext of religion, so did Philip of Spain’s campaign against England. Henry VIII of England had rejected the au- thority of the po pe and se t himself up as head of the Church of England. When his daughter, Elizabeth, ordered the execution of her Catholic rival, Mary Queen of Scots, Philip (who had been king of England 30 years pr ior, when he was married to Mary I) thought the time had come for action. By 1588, Spain had become a powerful empire—with colonies in the New Worl d that had made them rich. Money poured into Spanish coffers dur ing the sixteenth century—the country imported it the way the U nited States imports big-screen t elevisions, giving little in return. What a magnif- icent system of imperial f inance. Ships went west with soldiers and came bac k with gold and silver. It was almost as good as America’s system. In 2005, ships went west from Long Beach and Seattle almost empty. They came back full to the gunwales with Asian-made goods. And like America’s system, Spain’s trade was almost too good to be true.

History records the Battle of Gravelines as one of the world’s most important naval engagements. The Spanish ships were trapped against the Flemish coast. The Spanish commander, the Duke of Medina, dec ided to use a portion of his f leet to hold off the English, while the rest made their way to open water. 6 The English engaged the defending Spanish ships with a 10-to-1 nu- me rical advantage. Soon, three of the huge Spanish galleons were sunk, with 600 Spaniards killed and more than 800 others wounded. “The decks ran with their blood,” said eyewitness accounts. 7 Most of the English ships, having done their work and run out of am- munition, sought their ports. The Spanish, badly battered and realizing their cause was doomed, decided they could not f ight their way back through the Channel. Instead, they sailed north intending to make their way around Scotland (though they had neglected to bring maps of the area) and thence back to Spain by the open Atlantic. What the English began, the gods f inished. On September 18, 1588, the Span iards ran into one of the worst storm severtosmashintoScotland.In high seas off Cape Wrath, the Invincible Armada proved vincible; it broke up. Some ships sank; others ran out of food and water. In an effort to keep theleaky vessels above water, sailors manned the buckets day and night, but ma ny soon rano ut of energy or died of scurvy, dy sentery, and fever. The sun was never supposed to set on Philip’s Spanish empire. But it sank along with the armada in 1588. Financially, Spanish fortunes had begun taking on water long before. “T he mines of Brazil were the ruin of Portugal, as those of Mexico and Peru had been of Sp ain; all manufacture fell into insane cont empt . . .” ex- plained Alfred Thayer Mahan in his opus, The Inf luence of Sea Power upon History, 1660 –1783, “The ten dency to trade, involving of necessity the production of som eth ing to trade with, is the national characteristic most important to the developm ent of sea power.” 8 Prices rose sharply in the sixteenth century. As a r esult of the increase in the money supply caused by the gold and silver shipped in from the colonies, prices in all of Europe went up 400 percent. Then, when the mines and robberies eased off after 1580, the inf lationary boom was over. A long depression began on the Iberian Peninsula. The Spanish and Por- tuguese were victims of their own good fortune."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"3 How Empires Work N othing is born but from another living thing.

But there is a slight family resemblance in the Spani sh colonial empire. Ships went to the New World from Spanish and Portuguese ports armed with so ldiers, provisions, and colonial administrators. They came back laden with gold and silver. Gold and silver was real money. It could not be easily replicated, counterfeited, or called into being with the stroke of a keyboard. Still, the increase in mon ey—with no corres pondin g in- crease in productive output—was fatal to the Iberians. They spent with- out really earning. They consumed without producing. When the f low of easy money stopped, they found that real money had made them really poor, no t rich. America’s impoverishment is even more ridiculous. She is sustained by foreign we alth, but without real money. It is merely paper money without the paper—electronic registration of units of paper money.

At least the gold taken from Latin America is still around today and is still valuable. The dollars created by the Treasury are like ly to disappear completely. The United States entered the empire business in the late nineteenth century. She was able to straighten herself out for a few years but the lure of it later became irresistible. Between 1917 and 1971, the country was transformed f rom a simpl ere public that mostly minded its own business to a grandiose empire with imagined interests and real troops nearly everywhere. In normal places at normal times, people go about their normal lives earning a living the best they can. But an empire chan ges the way people think. The common householder turns away from his humble house and his spouse and begins to think about the fair world be yond his kith, kin, and ken. He looks outward and sees how much better the world could be if he and his fellow citizens could run it their way. He sees that he must play a greater role in g lobal affairs that he m ust walk on the world stage, not as a bit player, but as the main character—the hero. He must play the lead role. Instead of sticking to their looms, f ields, and factories, the imperial citizens begin to appreciate the f inancial logic of empire: They enjoy the loot that com es from the far edges of the imperial system. Gradually, they neglect their own commerce and depend on their subordinates, lackeys, and subject peoples to support them. While administrative commands, fashions, and proclamations f low from the center of the empire to the ex- trem ities, there also is an important f low in the other direction. Rome bro ught in its wheat from Egypt ( Romans needed bread ), its gladiators from the Balkans ( Romans wanted circuses), its soldiers from Gaul, and its mon ey from foreign treasuries and tax collectors from Judea to Britannia. A modest republic pays its own way. In 1952, nearly 90 percent of the federal government’s borrowings came from domestic investors. Ameri- cans saved their money and used some of it to support the programs of the Eisenhower administration. But the maturing empire of 2005 depends on a global debt market and the savings of foreigners. From l ess than 5 per- cent of Tr easury bonds in overseas hands in 1952, the total now ap- proaches 45 percent, while the percentage of lending coming from domestic sources has been cut in half.

And money comes from all over the Eastern Periphery to keep it all going. THE HISTORY OF EMPIRES Re ading the history of empir es, we learn that the central power tends to weaken as the periphery states grow stronger. Eventually, the s ubo rdinate states get tired of supporting the imperium. They stop paying tribute and show up at the gates of Rome. France and En gland built their own empires in the eighteenth and nin eteenth centuri es. Napoleon’s conquests took less than a dozen years to complete, but the empire collapsed even f aster. By the end of the nin eteenth century, all that was left of the French empire were a few is- lands no on e could f ind on a map and some godforsaken colonies in Africa that the French wou ld soon regret ever having laid eyes on. Al- most all were lost, forgotten, or surrendered by the 1960s with nothing much to show for them except what you f ind in the Louvre—and a pop- ulation of African immigrants who now weigh heavily on France’s social welf are bu dget. England’s empire was much grander, stretched further, and left more deb ris when it broke up. But the end result was about the same: The pou nd was degraded and the British were nearly bankrupt. Ge rm any lost its overseas colonies after World War I. It then created another empire—by conqu est—in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The en- ter prise ran into Russia’s empire in the East—resulting in history’s largest and bloodiest land battles. In the end, thanks partly to American interven- tion on the side of the Russians, the German empire was destroyed. The Russ ians’ empire collapsed under its own weight 44 years l ater. ••• While the Roma ns were still k icking Sa bine derrieres, Athens was al- readyam ini- empire.

He brought the Athe nians within the city’s walls h oping that the enemy would ex- haust itself in futile attacks. But bubonic plague broke out in the besieged city and killed a quarter of the population—including Pericles. Thence, a nephew of Pericles, Al- cibiades, stirred the Athenians to an offensive campaign. A great armada was assembled to attack Syra cuse, a city in Sicily allied with Athens’ foes. The campaign was a complete disaster. The armada was destroyed and the army sold in to slavery. Sensing a shift in the wind, other Greek city- states broke with Athens and went over to Sparta. In 405 BC , the remain- ing ships in the Athenian f leet were captured at the battle of Aegospotami. Not lo ng after, Athens’ walls were brea ched an d the city became a vassal state to Sparta. Th e Athenian empire was replaced by the Spartan empire, which was eventually supplanted by the Macedonian empire, which then became the empire of Al exander. When Alexander died in 323 BC ,his empire died with him. The next great chapter of imperial history was written by the Romans, wh o defeated what was left of the Greeks at the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC . On e empire died. Another was born. Nature can’t bear a va cuum and abhors a monopoly. A world without an empire is a world with a hole in it. An empire f ills the empty spot. But Nature is a f ickle mistr ess. No sooner has an empire been born than Nature hardens her face against it. An empire has a monopoly on the use of force, or attempts to have one. An empire cl aims for itself the exclusive right to use pr eemptive force against any power that may pose a challenge. Nature tolerates it for a wh ile. But she nurtures rivals and encourages competitors. Sooner or later, they f ind their opportunity. Athens ran the f irst recorded empire in the W est. America runs the current one; it took over from Britain after World War I. For the f irst eight decades, Americans denied any imperial role or purple ambitions. But by the early twenty-f irst century, they were warming up to empire. In March 2004, the Ne w York Times reported th at it was now respectable to describe the United States as an empire. “Today,” said the NYT, “Ame rica is no me re superpower or hegemon, but a full blown empire in the Roman and British sense.” “N o cou ntry has been as dom inant culturally, economically, techno- logica lly and militarily in the history of the world since the Roman Em- pir e,” 1 added the columnist in the same paper."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"How Empires Work 59 Robert Kaplan’s book, Wa rrior Politics: Why Leadership Demands a Pagan Ethos, gave this assessment: Our future leaders could do worse than be praised for their tenacity, their penetrating intellects and their ability to bring prosperity to dis- tant part of the wo rld under America’s soft imperial inf luence. The mo re successful our foreign policy, the more leverage Americans will have in the world. Thus, the more likely that future historians will loo k back on the twenty-f irst century United States as an empire as we ll as a republic, however different from that of Roman and every other empire throughout history. 2 The June 11, 2005, edition of IHT ran Roger Cohen’s “G lobalist” column, which contained this remark: “We guarantee the security of the wo rld, protect our allies, keep critical sea lanes open and lead the war on terror,” said Max Boot of the imperial burden. “. . . the Pax Ameri cana in Asia, as in Europe, has been conducive to a half-century of growth, peace and prosperity.” 3 Paul Kennedy went further, pointing out that the imbalance is even greater than in the Roman era. “The Roman Empire stretched further afield ,” he notes, “but there was another great empire in Persia and a larger one in China.” 4 America had no rivals, he said. Militarily, China was no real competi- tion; it was just another country on America’s hit list. Even after 227 years, America’s stock continues to rise.

What Swiss presi dent gets to send troops to remote hellholes, join a peace-keeping mission, or f ight terrorists? How often do the Swiss get to cheer on their heroes and mourn their dead? Who even knows who the president of Switzerland is? Who cares? While Americans get to make a public spectacle of themselves, the Swiss have to make do with private life. The Swiss have to mind their own business and watch the Sturm und Drang of the world pass them by. But would the Swiss really be better off if they, too, had an empire to run? The available evidence from history is mixed and anecdotal. If the past is any guide, early military successes are inevitably followed by hu- miliating defeats.

It is not for us to know the future or to prescribe it. Instead, we get out our f ield glasses and prepare to watch the spectacle.

Tiberius clipped the coinage (reduced the precious metal content). This, and other prudent polici es, greatly increased the amount of money in the treasury. By the time he was assassinated in AD 37, there were 700 million den arii in the treasury—far more than there had been at the time of Au- gustus’s death. Tiberius handed off the imperial purple to Caligula, who quickly spent all the savings and more. Rome suffere daseriesofmadandlavishrulers. To conf iscate the money of wealthy Roman families, Caligula would falsely accuse them of plotting against him. He was succeeded by Clau dius wh o, in turn, gave way to Nero. By this time, Rome was deeply in debt and running large trade def icits with its periphery states—similar to the condition of the United States today. Nero took the time-honored expedi- ent of clipping the coins (taking out the gold and silver content) even more. In AD 64, he proclaimed that hencefort htheau reus would be 10 percent lighter in weight. So, whereas in the past, 41 aurei had been minted from one pound of gold, the ratio now become 45 aurei to a pound. Nero was deposed in AD 68. But the prec edent was set. Maintaining order throughout the empire was expensive. Rome became dependent on imported capital, imported soldiers, and imported goods—just as America is today. But Rome had its own version of a central bank. Each new emer- gency was met with more phony cash just as it is today. By the time the barbarians sacked Rom e, the currency, the denarius, still bore the anc ient form with the images of dead emperors pressed on it. But the value had been taken o ut; the currency had lost 99.98 percent of its value. While this seems like a drea dful rate of inf lation, it is not really as bad as the cur- rent U.S. example. In less than 100 years, the U.S. dollar has lost 95 per- cent of its value. If this rate continues for just another 150 years, the dollar will do in half the time what took the denarius almost 500 years. Thomas Cahill describes the last days of Rome in his book, How the Irish Saved Civilization: ... the changing character of the native population, brought about through unremarked pressures on porous borders; the creation of an in- creasingly unwieldy and rigid bureaucracy, whose own survival be- com es its overriding goal; the despising of the military and the avoidance of its service by established families, while its off ices pre sent"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"62 IMPERIA ABSURDUM unp recedented opport unity for marginal men to whom its ranks had once been closed; the lip service paid to values long dead; the pretense that we still are wh at we once were; the increasing concentrations of the populace into richer and poorer by way of a corrupt tax system, and the desperation that inevitably follows; the aggrandizement of execu- tive pow er at the expense of the legislature; ineffectual legislation prom ulgated with great show; the moral vocation of the man at the top to maintain order at all costs, while growing blind to the cruel dilem- mas of ordinary life . . . Cahill continues: ... these are all themes with which our world is familiar, nor are they the God-given property of any party or political point of view, even though we often act as if they were. At least, the emperor could not heap his economic burdens on posterity by creating long-term public debt, for f loating capital had not yet been conceptualized. The only kinds of wealth worth speaking of were the fruits of the earth. 5 Finally, the cost so weakened the empire that the barbarians were at the gate. “T he thick er the grass, the more easily scythed,” said Alaric, king of the Visigoths, from AD 395 to 410 He was speaking to the Roman envoys sent to shoo him away. The Roman envoys had just told him that if he and his f ilthy band of barbarian bu ddies didn’t go away, they would unleash legions of Roman wa rriors to crush him. They then asked him what it would take for him to turn around and go. He replied that his men would like to comb the city, take all the gold and silver plus everything else valuable that could be moved, plus all the barb ari an slaves. And what, said the envoys, would that leave us Romans? Replied Alaric, “your lives.” 6 Empires, like bubble markets, end up where they began. Rome began as a town on the Tiber, with sheep grazing on the hills. A bull market in Ro man property lasted about 1,000 years—from 700 BC to about AD 300, wh en temples, monuments, and villas crowded the Palatine.

They had been built for a reason, but no one could recall why. IN P RAISE OF EMPIRES It is said that empires provide an expanse of law and order under which trade, commerce, investment, and prof it taking can f lourish. Here, we will spot the empire builders and their apologists a point or two. Even the Mongol reign of terror was said to have permitted an uptick in trade. And wh y not? The imperialists levied a tribute on output. They had an interest in economic growth. Why shouldn’t they make sure bills were paid and property was safe? One of the leading proponents of the American empire is a man named Deepak Lal, who wrote a book entitled In Praise of Empires. “T he Ro man empire had through its Pax brought unprecedented p rosper- ity to the inhabitants of the Mediterranean littoral for nearly a millen- nium,” Lal writes. 7 He believes that empires are good things, because peop le are materially better off under imperial rule than other forms of government. We have no intention of trying to prove him wrong. The econom ic rec ord is not complete enough to prove anything. How fat and happy might the residents of the Me diterranean littoral have been if the Roma ns had stayed in Rome? We don’t know. Nor do we know much abo ut the relative growth rates of groups not under Roman rule. So we cannot prove an ything, except that Lal can’t either. And for that we need to call only one witness to the stand, Lal himself. In the 500 years preceding World War II, when the economic picture is more visible, the Holy Roman Empire—which, as Voltaire remarked, was neither holy, nor Roman, nor a real empire—was extinguished. In its place rose various sovereign nation-states, often with imperial ambitions and bubble-like excesses, but none able to assert itself over much of Europe or for very long. Europe, in other words, was nonimperial. China, India, and Anatolia/the Middle East, by contrast, were still run by the vestiges of the Mongol Empire and its successors. Which civilization was most suc- cessful economically? We have no f igures for the Ottoman Empire, but the 500 years in China produced a net decline in GDP per person. In India, the rate of increase was negligible according to the f igures that Lal"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"64 IMPERIA ABSURDUM presents; all the growth that there was came af ter the Mogul Empire had been replaced by the British. It wasn’t imperial rule that gave the place a shot in the arm; it was British investment and know-how. Lal makes the point decisively and then proceeds to ignore it: By creat ing order over a large economic space, empires have inevitably generated Smithian [as in Adam Smith’s We alth of Nations ] growth. But given limited technological progress (except for the exceptional period under Sung China), Promethean intensive growth remains a European miracle of the anarchical system of nation-states established after the breakdown of the Roman empire. 8 Actually, there are other instances of Promethean growth (e.g., Japan, Hong Ko ng, and Singapore after World War II). And currently, China is growing a t9percentperyear.RussiaandIndiaaregrowingat7percent. It could be argued that their growth is largely thanks to the s hade provided by the Amer i cans’ imperial protection. But then you have to wonder why otherp laces, similarly protected, enjoyed no such growth. You also have to wonder how other places, such as Switzerland and the Scandinavian countriesgot to be the wealthiest places in the world when they en joyed no mo re imperial benef its than anywhere else and were largely indifferent to the imperial system. You also have to wonder how it is possible for China to register such high growth rates in the 1990s and 2000s when it is the very thing from which the American imperium offers protection. Ap- parently, an empire may increase growth r ates even for its enemies. Th e logic of Lal’s “praise of empir es” is no diffe rent from saying he likes chocolate cake. It is purely a matter of personal taste, nothing more. All we actually know about economic growth is that empire is neither a necessar y nor a suf ficient conditio n for it. Empi res come and go often, like stock markets. When they shoot up quickly, th ey generally fall sharply, too. And when they take centuries to build—as with the Romans—it takes centuries to take them back to wh ere they began. By using carrier pigeons, the Mamelukes could have speedy news of all who come and go by sea or land, and thus escape sur- prise, since they live without defenses, and have neither walls nor fortresses. What f inally destroyed the Mongols was the plague, which they pick ed up in the Far East, and gunpowder, which they also encountered in Ch ina.

By the ninet eenth and twentieth centuri es, they were paying their own tribute to Russian and Chinese empire builders. Since the days of the great Khans, empires have become much more entertaining. This is not because they are less lethal. It is because they are much more delusional. They cannot bear the barbaric clarity of Genghis’s imperial ambitions. They cannot put on the purple without putting on the masks. After a while their faces take the shape of the mask itself. Rather than follow their atavistic urges and give hon est voice to their primitive instincts, they feel obliged to provide reasons that are often fatal to the be- liever and his victim, but hilarious to the distant observer. Mod ern imperialists, like their distant ancestors, lust after the usual thi ngs—prestige, power, money, status—all proxi es, perhaps, for genetic dispersement. These were the same urges that enticed the Khans and the Caesars. But today’s imperialists feel ashamed to admit it. So, they pretend all manner of self less and world-improving motives, ever yone of which is either an obvious fraud or a monumental bamboozle. But that is what ma kes the whole thing so much more amusing and entertaining than either a modest republic or a primitive empire: Modern empire builders are such quacks and popinjays that they practically sprout tail feathers and grow web bed feet.

The logic of it is inescapable: He feels superior bec ause he rules them. And why does he rule them? Because he is superior! Since the days of Alexander, empire builders have developed elaborate and heroically absurd proofs for why they are superior. They have before them the evi dence of their achievements; they have their neighbors under their heel and not the other way around. Fooled by the randomness of his- torical events, they look for a reason that explains their superiority and justif ies their own rule. Many are the daffy explanations and spurious proofs offered. Typi- cally, a group believes it is given its right to rule directly from God. Jeho- vah del ivered to the Jews title to the land of milk and honey. It didn’t ma tter to them that there were other people who claimed title, too. “Slay them all,” says their God. “And woe to you if you let any of them get away.” The Jews thought they had a special covenant with God.

Was it a matter of race? Religion? Culture? At one time or another, they put forward each of these hypotheses—sometimes all of them. Euro- peans were a superior race; therefore, they had evolved superior forms of religio n, government, and culture. An d what accounted for their racial superiority? No delusion was too preposterous. When the Romans were on top of the world, they thought their mild climate must be responsible for creating the world’s best hu- ma ns. Two millennia later, when the center of empire had shifted to northern Europe, the rigors of European winters were credited with stiff- ening upper lips, backbones, and virtues. English ladies, traveling in the tropics, wore long-sleeved shirts and carried paraso ls, for fear that too muc h of the tropical sun might cause them to “go native.” The effect of all this self-deception is to turn the imperialists into a race of fools. They have to believe what isn’t true—that they are, person- ally and collectively, better than the people they boss around. Constant dissembling has a corrosive effect on brains and a numbing effect on souls. European imperialists wondered if the Africans, East Indians, and Asians we re fully human; often, they treated their subjects as though they thoug ht they were not. AUST RO -HUN GARIANS The impulse to imperial power is always the same, but there are many types of imperium. From the pure simplicity of the Mongols to the in- compr ehensible com plexity of the Austro-Hungarians, you could make a go of almost any kind of empire. Wher eas the Mongols got their empire by force, the Austro-Hungarian Empire (1867–1918) also known as the dual monarchy came into being largely because they couldn’t think of any- thi ng better to do with it. Even its formal name—The Kingdoms and Lan ds Re presented in the Imperial Council and the Lands of the Holy Hu ngar ian Crown (of Stephen)—was a pileup of words on the informa- tion highway. Then, as now, no one knew how the empire worke d—in- cluding the people who supposedly ran it. But that it was an empire, we have no dou bt. “A basic, consensus def inition would be that an empire is a large political body which rules over territories outside its original borders,” explains Stephen Howe in"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"68 IMPERIA ABSURDUM Empire. 10 Austro-Hungary ruled over the Kingdom of Bohemia, the Kingdom of Dalmatia, the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, the Archduchy of Austria, the Duchy of Bukowina, the Duchy of Carinthia, the Duchy of Carniola, the Duchy of Salzburg, the Duchy of Upper Sile- sia and Lower Silesia, the Duchy of Styria, the Margraviate of Moravia, the Prince ly County of Tyrol (including the Land of Vorarlberg), the Coastal Land (including the Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca, the City of Trieste, and the Margraviate of Istria). And this was just on the Austrian side. On the Hungarian side were all the many obnoxious, quarreling peoples of central Europe and the Balkans—the Slovaks, Bohemians, Moravians, I talians, Pol es, Ukrainians, Serbs, Albanians, Macedonians, Croats, Bosnians, Herzegovinians, Mon- tegrans, Czechs, Magyars, and many others. Each of these territories had its own language and customs. Many de- tested each other. All were jealous of power and how it was used. And at the top were some of the weakest and most confused and conf licted ad- ministrators who ever lived. Each had several layers of loyalties: to his own nation; his own class; his own religion; his own family, region, cul- ture, and linguistic group; and his own aristocracy. How could you hope to govern such an empire? The beauty of it was that you couldn’t. There were two separate par- liaments and two separate prime ministers along with a collection of arch- duk es of various talents and responsibiliti es. In theory, the one royal hou se—the Habsburgs—had absolute power over the central administra- tion—particular ly the military. In practice, th ey could do little or noth- ing; they had no money. Occasionally a forceful edict would issue from the government, such as the April 5, 1897, proclamation from the Aus- trian prime minister, Kasimir Felix Graf von B adeni th at permitted the use of the Czech language, along with German, in Bohemia. The ordi- nance caused so much trouble that p oor Badeni was tossed out and Czech was more suppressed than before. Henceforth, Czech newspapers would have to be pr inted in German! Despite these annoyances, the empire was a mod est success. It was largely peaceful and prosperous. Between 1870 and 1913, GDP per capita rose at an annual rate of 1.45 percent, which was faster than the rate in Britain or France, and almost as fast as in Germany.

No such simple marker exists, however, between empire and other forms of governmen t. Nor does any precise boundary exist between democracy and, say, theocracy or dictatorship. Governments are categorized artif i- cially and often arbitrarily on the basis of theories—usually fraudu lent ones. It is often said that democracies depend on the consent of the gov- erned, whereas dictatorships and monarchies do not. A moment ’s ref lec- tion, even by a professor of government, would reveal the lie. All systems of government depend on some measure of complicity. “Given the very small n umber and insignif icant presence of imperial agents and municipal off icials to insure obedience to the st ate,” explains Ramsay MacMullen in his Co rruption and the Decline of Rome, “mil- lionaires, magnates, and other local notables of all sorts must have cooper- ated, and from the ir own fre ewil l.” 11 It do esn’t matter whether you call a pol itical society free, a democracy, a dictatorship, or an empire, it al- ways involves a great amount of collusion and cooperation on the part of the p opulation. “[Imperial] administrators occupied only a minor place in the sys- tem. The emperor had only a handful of agents, whose means of reach- ing the p eople were few and rudimentary. The police were practically none xistent. There were neither social workers nor prosecutors,” 12 Mac- Mullen continues. The p eople who actually ran things “had no off icial function, or if they had one, they had no need of it to make themselves heard. A huge number of decisions were taken each day and throughout the empire that conformed to their own desires more than to the law, the emperor, or his"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"70 IMPERIA ABSURDUM representativ es. What’s more, these decisions were those that counted, those that concerned property, movement, career choic es, success on the far m, commerce or banking; sometimes even a person’s physical safety.” 13 In business, as in empire, v ast, complex, informal systems work largely on the basis of trust. People trust others to do more or less what they ex- pect. The emperor could no more control what was done in Judea or Gaul than we can control what goes into our hamburgers. Still, we trust there is nothing to o unsavory in them. In the Roman Empire, order was transmitted through an extended we b of personal connections, family ties, off icial functions, traditions, habits, and accepted ideas and procedures so that what happened was more or less what ever yone expected. The emperor tr usted not only his own functionari es to do what they were supposed to do, but also the local big shots with no off icial post or authority. The lowest slave res ponded to his overseer, who responded to his master, who res ponded to hi s land lord, who responded to his patron, who responded to his pot entiores, consuls, proconsuls, proteuntes, praetors, and quaestors, on up the chain of com- mand to the emperor himself. Even prisons function with the cooperation and complicity of the convicts. In the Soviet gulag system, for example, a group of people—sol- diers con scripted and sent to Siberia against their will—policed one group of prisone rs wh o in turn policed a less fortunate group. Supposedly, the ent ire Soviet Union functioned as a vast slave society, in which ever yone was told what to do and no one had any choice in the matter. But how could it be? If they were all in chains, who held the keys? And why did the jailers suddenly undo the locks in 1989? We do notargue that the Soviet system was not wretched, but only that the border between its wretchedness and the misery inf licted by other systems of political organization is not nearly as well marked as we have been told. Always and everywhere, nuances and particularities trump the th eories. A dictator cannot rule a country on his own. He needs the help of henchm en and hangmen, soldiers and administrators, tax collectors, and spies. Depending on the size of the country, he might have millions of people all with a stake in his rule. Likewise, what monarch really ruled alon e? Even the Sun King, Louis XIV, depended on a whole solar sys- tem...no, a galaxy...of supporters, agents, and factota.

There is no discreet line between em- pire and republic, or any other form of government for that matter. But that doesn’t mean there is no difference. Sailing from the Caribbean to the No rth Atlantic, a voyager crosses no white line. Still, the weather in the two plac es is hardly the same. A nat ion ma y have elections and yet not be a genuine democracy. It may have a king, but not be a genuine monarchy. It may even call itself an empire—such as the Central Afri can Empire, which bullied several tribes in West Africa—but that doesn’t mean it is one. Th ereisplenty of room for fraud and interpretation in political insti- tutions, just as there is in the rest of life. Julius Caesar was accused of being adictator.Hewascutdownbytheoldguard,whowantedtopreservethe republic. But Rome had taken the path of empire long before Caesar was bor n. Like the United States today, it had troops spread far be yond the homeland. For f ive centuries, the Romans had been imposing themselves, f irst in wha tisnowItalyand then the Cisalpine re gion, the Gr eek Isles, thec oast of Anatolia, and down through the Middle East. Caesar himself made hisreputation in his wars against the Gauls—people far from Rome who spoke a different language, with different customs, diffe rent tradi- tions, different institutions, and different ideas about how things should be done . Caesar believed he was bringing the benef its of Romanization, which to him was one in the sam easbringingcivilizationitself. Octavian, Caesar’s heir, did not call himself emperor or announce that hencefo rth Rome wou ld be an empire. He did not need to. The term im- perator meant “general.” He was already an imperator. Nor was he partic- ularly eager to stir up re sentment among the republi can partisans. He had seen what had happened to his uncle. Let the empire evolve; just don’t ment ion it. Speaking to the senate, he was careful to play to the old senti- ments: “And now I give back the Re public into your keeping. The laws, the troops, the treasury, the provinces are all restored to you. May you guard them worthily.” 14 But the old Republic existed only in their dreams and imaginations. No ma tter what they said, Rome was an empire. The se nators crowned him Augustus, and forgot the old constitution. “Peop le do not easily change, but love their own anc ient customs”; wro te Aristotle in his Politics. “And it is by small degrees only that one thi ng takes the place of another; so that the anc ient laws will rem ain,"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"72 IMPERIA ABSURDUM while th e power will be in the hands of those who have brought about a revolution in the state.” 15 The revolution in Rome took centuries. In America, it took only 58 years (1913–1971). In both cases, most people hardly noticed. The changes were gradual and, generally, agreeable. A re public, a monarchy, or even a dictatorship is a relatively modest undertaking. Its scope is limited, and controlled by leading citizens either through their inf luence on the autocrat or by shaping public opinion. An empire, on the other hand, steps onto the world stage and plays a role that is beyond the control of the citizens. Private l ife becomes auxiliary, mov- ing to a supporting role while the grand public spectacle plays itself out. In the United States Constitution, it is expressly stated that the people are sovereign, no t the government. Ultimately, what people want in their pri- vate liv es is what is supposed to matter. B ut the idea passed away when the American Republic died and the empire was born. By 1960, John Kennedy was able to lecture voters to “ask not what the country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.” Suddenly, the govern- ment that was created by, for, and of the people was way out in front of them. They found themselves servants to it, no longer its masters. They could, of course, still write letters to the editor and still vote, but the force of these expressions had g one out of them. Th eform had barely changed, but the meaning of it had turned around, like a word that had come to mean the opposite of what it once signif ied. Virtually, for exam- ple, once meant “ truly.” People would promise to be there “virtually” at noon.O vertime, meaning follows practice; virtually slipped to mean not truly, almost, nearly, or sort of. So did the United States Congress come to be wha titnow is, something not-q uite-what-it-was-meant-to-be. Another important event of the revolution in American politics oc- curred on June 25, 1950. That is the day on which Harry Truman in- volved the United States in a war in Korea without authorization from Co ngress. The Constitution clearly states that the people’s repre sentatives alone have thep owe rtod etermine when the nation’s blood and treasure shou ld be putatrisk. But on that date, Truman sent U.S. troops to kill and die, without even informing Congress. Even though this happened while Congress was i ns ession, members of the people’s assemblies found out about it from reading the newspapers. For a week, Congress had little idea of wha tw as going on, until the commander-in-chief dec ided to tell them. As you might expect, a few members of Congress were cheesed off. But the majority went along. Like the senate in Rome, they had eaten of"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"How Empires Work 73 the imperial fruit and liked the taste of it. American forces had to react quickly, they were told. It was a “new era” in warfare, they believed. There was no time for discussion. Meanwhile, the Korean War went on for another 37 months—you would think that they might have found time to talk about it. What had happened was not that the rest of the world had changed so much, b ut that America had changed. Truman’s doctrine—that the United States would intervene anywhere in the world where it felt its in- terests were threatened—was not the doctrine of Monroe or Jefferson. It was an imperial doctrine. By then, the nation’s focus had shifted away from the private desires and opinions of citizens, as expressed through their elected representativ es, to the world outside America’s borders. What the people thought no longer really counted for much. Public opin- ion was important, but it was merely part of the imperial burden—some- thi ng to be carried around, manipulated, and managed. To that end, even in 1951, a huge pr opaganda apparatus was already set up—with conf iden- tial brief ings, press leaks, public relations spec ialists, and enormous print- ing and publishing arms. Even then, the executive branch was spinning the ne ws to appeal to the marginal voter. They hardly had to bother. The average American reacted just as the avera ge Roman had reacted. When the purple was hoisted, he stood up and saluted. It made him feel like a big shot. If Americans were bossing peop le around in Asia or the Middle East, it made him feel more impor- tant. His homeland team was winning all over the world. And if it did not always seem to be on the w inning side, he knew he must support his troops and stand behind their commander-in-chief. No one wants to carp and criticize when soldiers take the f ield. It is unpatriotic. So, keep the soldiers in the f ield all the time! While there is no precise DNA test that separates an empire from a or- dinary country, there are certain tel ltale chara cteristics. A regular country has only its own territory. An empire has a “ homeland” and various terri- torial interestsb eyond it. It may have s ubo rdinate states, protectorates, colonies, satellites, or other client states over whom it exercises a substan- tial au thority. Sometimes it is not even mentioned; but the clients know that if they get out of line, the imperium will c ome down on them. Typi- cally, the people in the homeland feel superior to the people in the periph- ery areas. As described, they dev elop reasons and expl anations for their superiority, which are then used to justify further imperial expansion."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"74 IMPERIA ABSURDUM THE AMERICAN EMPIRE America took its f irst awkward steps toward empire at the end of the nin eteenth century, with Theodore Roosevelt intervening in various diar- rhea countries for forgettable reasons and with regrettable results. Later, in April 1917, Woodrow Wilson took off at a trot with the fat Rough Rider still breathing down his neck. He urged Congress to declare war on a dis- tant country with which it had no real beef and in which it had no gen- uine interest. Tw ent y-three years later, the United States was in another major war. Few would argue that World War II was a case of needless intervention, since the U.S. f leet was attacked at Pearl Harbor. Still, had America wa nted to stay out of it, she could have done so. Pearl Harbor was attacked bec ause the U.S. Navy posed a threat to Japanese imperial ambitions. If the United States had not displayed imperial ambitions of her own and had no satellite state in the Philippines, she would have pre sented no dan ger to the Japanese imperial forces. Nor was there any particular reason to go to wa r against Germany. Though allied to Japan, there was no question of Germany intervening in the Pacif ic War. After World War II, America stepped up the pace, engaging in 111 militar y actions between 1945 and 2005. Tod ay, the U.S. military divides the world into four regional com- ma nds, each given initials—PAC, EUR, CENT, and SOUTH. Each re- gion has its own commander-in-chief (CINC), who is like a proconsul of the Roman Empire. American military bases can be found in 120 differ- ent countries, with strike forces ready to light out for almost any place on the planet at a moment’s notice. There is also a vast army of functionaries, intermediaries, consultants, advisors, scientists, engineers, contractors, and b usybodies spread all over the globe. Trained in American universities, on the payroll of either the American government or oft-linked U.S. companies, these people provide a class of administrators to keep the imperial money and papers moving. The wor kofthesep eople was revealed in a marvelous book by John Perkins called Co nfessions of an Economic Hit Man. A supervisor ex- plained to him: There were two primary objectives of my work, First I was to justify huge international loans that would funnel money back to MAIN [the"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"How Empires Work 75 consul ting f irm for whom he labored] and other U .S. companies (such as Bechtel, Halliburton, Stone & Webster, and Brown & Root) through massive engineering and construction projects. Second, I would work to bankrupt the countri es that received those loans (after they had paid MAIN and other U.S. contractors, of course) so that they wou ld be forever beholden to their cre ditors and so they would pre sent easy targets when we n eeded favors, including military bas es, UN votes, or access to oil and other natural resources. “W ho can doubt that there is an American empire?” wrote Arthur Schlesinger Jr. “an informal empire, not colonial in polity, but still richly equipped with imperial paraphernalia: troops, ships, planes, bases, proconsuls, local coll aborators, all spread around the luckless planet.” 16 Am erica had mixed and confusing sentiments about empire from the get-go. Its founders were schooled in the history of Rome and determined to avoid what they saw as her mistakes. But at the same time, they couldn’t help but lust for the grandeur of it. They longed for the imperial purple, perhaps, from the very beginning. Wi lliam Drayton, chief justice of the highest court in South Carolina, wr ote in 1776: Empires have their zenith—and their declension and dissolu- tion....The British period is from the year 1758, when they victori- ously pursued their Enemies into every Quarter of the G lobe. ...The Almighty ...has made the choice of the pre sent generation to erect the American Empire ...and thus has sudde nly arisen in the World, a new Empire, styled the U nited States of America. An Empire that as soon as started into Existence, attracts the attention of the Rest of the Un iverse; and bids fair by the blessing of God, to be the most glorious of any upon Record. 17 John Quincy Adams, however, cautioned that while “she might be- come the dictatress of the world: she would be no longer ruler of her own spirit.” 18 Mo re than two centuries later, her spirit has run wild. She has soldiers garrisoned al l over the world. She has interests in places few Americans have ever heard of and fewer still care about. There is no cor- ner or dead-end street in the world that is not somehow patrolled by U.S. forces. At the end of this year, America is scheduled to spend more in a single year on defense than all the rest of the world combined."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"76 IMPERIA ABSURDUM Already, reade rs must be asking themselves questions: The United States is the world’s only superpower; since the capitulation of the Soviet Union, she has no enemies capable of inf licting serious damage; what is she defending herself against? But that is just the point. The imperial spirit has gotten the best of her. She no longer plays a role that she can understand and control. Now, she is an imperial power; she must read from the script that has been thr ust in her hands. She must provide secu- rity for the entire world. She must provide the public good of law and order. Some one has to do it. Who else could, but America? It is her turn to wear the purple, whether she wants to do so or not. Thus, did she be- come dictatress of the world; but no longer ruler of her own spirit—or her own f inances. We stop a moment to ref lect. The urge to empire is as irresistible as a free lunch. The male of the species cannot pass up a chance to strut around feeling superior. Scarlet tunics and ostrich feathers have gone out of style, but the men who wore them are the same as those who sacked Rome with Alaric, laid waste to Albi with the Duke de Montfort, and entered Bagh- dad with the Third Army. The uniforms change, but men are the same grasp ing, vaunting, humbugging dudes they always have been. There is nothing quite so amusing as watching another man make a fool of himself. That is what makes history so entertaining. And what makes the histo ry of empires particularly entert aining is watching the great emperors: the Napoleons, Alexanders, Caesars, Attilas, and Adolphs—with all their pretensions and sordid b utchers—put on the red tunics and burnished hel- me ts, mount their white chargers, and ride right into a stone wall. While leaders make fools of themselves, the mass man is tanned by the ref lected glory of empire. His chin grows stron ger as he admires the stal- wa rt troops. His chest swells with every victory. He grows so tall he al- most hits his head at the top of doo rjambs. We literary economists, on the other hand, can barely suppress a l augh. It is obvious that the poor man has become delusional; but no one appreci ates our saying so. Still, we also feel superior, for we cannot help but notice what numskulls they are. Evol utionary bio logists reduce the whole impulse to empire to noth- ing more than genes and math. After a man has enough to eat, his genes—and by com mand, his t houghts and emotions—want nothing more than to spread his s eed as widely as possible.

President Wilson got America’s self-deception off to a r unning start early in the twentieth century: “I believe that God planted in us visions of liberty,” he said, seeking the Democratic nomination in 1912, “that we are ch osen and prominently chosen to show the way to the nations of the world ho w they shall walk in the path of liberty.” So worthy was the mission that there seemed no need to f igure out how to pay for it. If God had set us on the trail of Empire, He could jolly we ll f igure out how to pay for it. Neither then, nor now, have Americans bot hered to understand how the business of empire wo rks. They think they are doing the world a favor. That deception alone would not be so grav e, but they totally miss the point: Nearly every imperial power has claimed to act for the good of others, but they all found a way to make it pay. When it stops paying, they are out of business. Like the Maf ia, the United States runs a protection business. Under the protection of the imperial pax dollarium, trade and commerce can flouris h. People get rich. They should be grateful and happy to pay for the service. The imperial power must charge for that service; otherwise, what would be the point? But America has so cleverly deceived itself that it believes it gets its imm ediate tribute from global commerce and its th anks in Heaven. We have no way of know ing what awaits it in Heaven, but we look around and notice that the tribute America gets is so perverse that we’re glad she does not get more. Instead of getting paid for providing protection, the United States is on the receiving end of loans from its tributary states and trading partners. The whole idea is mad and preposterous. An imperial pow er is supposed to control lesser states and exploit them for its own self- ish ends. Of course, it does not admit it. Truthfulness is as much a disap- pointment in politic s as it is in marriage or poker. The idea is to pretend to do good, while you do well.

They can stop paying tribut e wh enever they want. “W ill China be setting U.S. rates?” asked an article in a May 2005 edition of the International Herald Tribune. 19 The writer, Floyd Norris, had noticed the perverse logic of American imperial f inance. What he had n’t realized was that China was already setting U.S. interest rates. By the end of 2004, China owned $120 billion of U.S. Treasury obliga- tion s—or 10 percent of the total in foreign hands, which itself was 25 per- cent of the total outstanding. 20 Had it not bought those bonds, or had it decided to sell them, there would have been signif icantly l ess demand for U.S. debt. Or, looked at from a more traditional perspective, there would have been fewer people willing to lend to the U nited States. Either way, the almost certain result of Chinese lending was to lower the price of lent money, that is, to lower inter est rates. Thanks to Asian lending, the United States was able to drop its interest rates below the rate of inf lation and keep them there for 22 months. 21 “T he way things work now,” Norris explained, “China sells to the wo rld most ever ything the world wants. Ch ina then uses the dollars it re- ceives to buy Treasury securities. That helps to hold down U.S. interest rates and stimulates consumer spending, enabling Americans to buy more from China.” 22 This put China in a commanding position. As Americans spent, China built its productive capacity. China got rich, selling gewgaws, elec- tronic knickknacks, and assorted consumer goods. The imperial con- sumers, on the other hand, got poorer. In 2004, alone, we alth equiva lent to 1 percent of the value of all the assets in the United States passed out of Americans’ hands. The idea of imperial f inance is that the central, imperial power gets rich at its vassals’ expense. America found a way to do it in reverse; it grew p oorer, relatively and absolutely, every day. GDP growth during the five years—2000 to 2005—averaged only 4.4 percent per annum in nom- inal terms. 23 Meanwhile, net operating losses—the difference between wh at she earned on overseas sales and what she spent on imports far out- pac ed GDP, growing in 2004 by 24 percent. 24 And the cost of maintaining her imperial role—the military budget—was 3.3 percent of GDP. 25 The whole thing was a losing proposit ion.

If the Chinese and other major holders of U.S. Treasury bonds were to sell, there wo uld be hell to pay in the United States. Interest rates would rise. The hou sing boo m would turn into a housing bust. The imperium would have to beg its subordinate states for more credit. “T he U.S. suffers from ...structural deficits that will limit the ef- fectiveness and duration of its crypto-imperial role in the world,” explains Niall Ferguson. “The f irst is the nation’s growing dependence on foreign capital to f inance excessive private and public consumption.

And so the question is more puzzling than ever. Has his blood changed? Hi s culture? Or his economy? A marvelous little book by John T. Flynn, As We Go Marching, 1 was written during World War II and provides some insights. Flynn argues that fascism had no particular connection to the Germans themselves nor was there anything in the Teuton spirit that made them especially suscep- tible. Instead, he points out that the creed was largely dev eloped by an Italian opportuni st, Benito Mussolini. It was the hefty I talian who figured out the main parts—including the glorious theatrical elements. The Ger- mans mere ly added their own corruptions and attached a peculiarly vi- cious policy of persecuting, and later exterminating, Jews. But it is Flynn’s description of the economic circumstances in Italy in the late ninet eenth and early twentieth centuri es—the fertile soil in which fascism took root and f lourished—that c aught o ur attention.

But the impulse that drove the Italians to wa r in the f irst place was the focus of Flynn’s attention: The vengeance of the I talian spirit on F ate was not appeased. Instead, it wh etted the appetite for glory. And once more glory did its work on the bu dget. But once more, peace—dreadful and realistic peace, the bill collector, heavy with her old problems—was back in Rome. The deficits were larger. The debt was greater, and the various economic plann ers we re more relentl ess than ever in their determination to sub- ject the capitalist system to control. 2 Perhaps they should have lowered interest rates. Or pressured China to raise its currency. Any policy initiative, no matter how pathetic, could be considered. As Flynn puts it: “Out of Italy [as out of America currently] had gone def initely any important party committed to the theory that the econom ic system should be free.” 3 Italy had dug herself into a deep hole of debt. Between 1859—when the centralized Italian st ate came into being—and 1925, the government ran def icits more than twice as often as it ran surpluses. Politicians, who depended on giving away other people’s money, found themselves with little left to give away. “A ll the old evils were growing in malignance,” writes Flynn. “The national debt was rising ominously. The army, navy, and social services we re absor bing half the revenues of the nation. Italy was the most heavily taxed nation in proportion to her wealth in Europe.” 4 Of course, there followed many episodes of f inancial ris orgimento and ma ny pledges to put the books in order. None of them stuck for long. Ital- ian politicians were soon making promises again. When grand promises must be fulf illed, debt creeps higher and so does the resistance of taxpayers and lenders, especially from conservative groups. “Hence it becomes increasingly diff icult to go on spending in the presence of persisting def icits and rising debt,” writes Flynn. “Some form of spending must be found that will command the support of conservative groups. Political leaders, embarrassed by their subsidies to the poor, soon learned that one of the easiest ways to spend money is on mi litary estab- lishm ents and armaments, because it commands the support of the groups most opposed to spending.” 5 Military spending gives an economy the false impression of growth and prosperity. People are put to work building expensive military hardware."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"As We Go Marching 83 Assembly lines roll and smokestacks smoke. Plus, the spending goes into the domestic economy. Americans, for example, may buy their gewgaws from China, but their tanks are homemade. Military adventures not only seem to stimulate the domestic econ- om y; they also goose up popular support for government. Soon, “it was a time for greatness ...” as Flynn describes the approach of war. War, Gio- vanni Papini raved, was “the great anvil of f ire and blood on which strong peoples are hammered.” 6 There was a time when kings, princes, and emperors ruled the world. Back then, the people knew their place. But in this new, modern world, it became necessary for rulers to appease the masses with various programs designed to fool them into obedience. Armed with ballots, ever ything seemed possible. Jose Ortega y Gasset describes the scene: Whereas in past time life for the average man meant f inding all around him diff iculties, dangers, want, limitations of his destiny, dependence, the new world appears as a sphere of practically limitless possibilities, safe and independent of anyone ...and if the traditional sentiment whispered: “To live is to feel onesel f limited, and therefore to have to count with that which limits us,” the newest voice shouts: “To live is to meet with no limitation whatever and, consequently, nothing is im- possible, nothing is dangerous. . . .” 7 He might have been describing the mind-set of the contemporary American investor, who sees no limit to stock prices and no risk any- wher e. And so he was—70 years ahead of his time. Vo ting cannot really increase the masses’ well-being. It brings no mo re hog s to market, builds no more gadgets, improves no meals, nor does it increase the eff iciency of the internal combustion engine. But the masses will believe anything; and af ter Bismarck and Garibaldi came to bel ieve that this new world of assemblies, parliaments, and election fraud offered a better world, it then became the job of politicians to f ind a way to appeal to these fantasies. This they did, in ninet eenth-century Italy as in twenty-f irst century America, by borrowing mon ey—thus creating the illusion of spen ding power out of thin air. From 1859 to 1925, the I talian government ran deficits over 46 years. In only 20 years was the budget balanced. The lire was not a re- serve currency; I talian politicos had to do the b est they could. But the"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"84 IMPERIA ABSURDUM debts continued and led to war. Not because anyone in particular wanted wa r or debt for that matter. It was just that one was an evolutionary con- sequ ence of the other and both were consequences of the natural urges of democratic society. Out of the condition of Italian society sprang cert ain streams of opin- ion and of desire that governments acted on and people accepted or at least surrendered to with little resistance, even though they may have not approved or even understood them. Bewildered statesmen turned to government debt as a device for creat ing purchasi ng power. No one approved it in principle. But there w as no effective re sistance because peop le dem anded the fruits it brought. Another was the ever-growing reliance of social-welfare measures to mitigate the privations of the in- digent, the unemployed, the sick, the ag ed. The instruments of debt and spending became standard equipment of politicians. And this need for spending opened the door to an easy surrender to the elements most interested in militarism and its handma iden, imperialism. 8 Whenever the debts threatened to overwhelm the nation, inventive politi- cians found new enemies to distract the people and quiet opponents. “If the country had no natural enemy to be cultivated, then an enemy had to be invented,” 9 wro te Flynn. Following th e war with Turkey, World War I provided fresh diver- sions. But after the war, the debts mounted even higher. The prewar debt was 15 billion lire. When the war ended it was four times as much. But after the war came new promises: an old-age pension system, unemploy- ment insurance, a national heath care plan. The def icit reached 11 billion lire in 1919, then rose to 17 billion in 1921. How could the debts possibly be paid? Was there any way out, people wondered? It was at this point that a scoundrel worthy of the crisis arrived on the scene and proceeded to make things worse. Be nito Mussolini was the man for the job—energetic, o pportunisti c—with no scruples or f ixed positions to hamper his movements. Mussolini, like Roosevelt, Bush, and practically every politician ele cted to any off ice in the entire twentieth century, de- nounced the loose spending policies of his predecessors and then spent even more. He decried the unbalanced budgets that had brought Italy to the brink of ruin and then piled new debt on the heavy end of the scale. Ta king office in 1921, he found himself with a debt of 93 billion lire. By 1923, the Ne w York Times estimated that his debt had risen to 405 billion lire, with a def icit for the year of 83 billion lire."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"As We Go Marching 85 “Spending had become a settled part of the policy of fascism to create national income,” conc luded Fly nn, “except that the fascist state spent on a scale unimaginable to the old premiers.” 10 “W e were able to give a new turn to f inancial policy,” explained an Italian pamphlet from the period, “which aimed at improving the public services and at the same time securing a more effective action on the part of the state in promoting and facilitating national progress.” 11 The policy ended in disaster. Spending on domestic programs shifted to spending on military ones. Soon, Italy was at war again. In blood, steel, shame, disgrace, and f inancial ruin, it settled its accounts. Th e roma ntic lure of empire—the political pull of military spending, the economic delusion, the polished br ass and boot s—it was all too much to resist. Despite a disastrous experience in World War I, even the fun- loving Italians were soon marching around in jack boots and getting out maps of Abyssinia under Mussolini’s new leadership. Mussolini was the perfect fascist. Like America’s leading neoconserva- tives, he was really a leftist, who saw an opportunity. And also like Amer- ica’s neoconservatives, he was an admirer of Machiavelli, who believed that the ruler “must suppose all men bad and exploit the evil qualities in their nature whenever suitable occasion offers.” Even Am erican s we re impr essed. “H e is something new and vital in the sluggish old veins of European politics,” said Sol Bloom, then chair- man of the House Foreign Relations Committee in 1926. “It will be a great thing not only for Italy but for all of us if he succeeds.” 12 In investments, as in war, an early defeat is often more rewa rding than a later one. Fortunately for the I talians, the Afri can campaign was a f iasco. In a few years, Mussolini was hanging from a meat hook and I talians went bac k to making shoes, handbags, and pasta. MILITARY ADVENTURISM A characteristic of all empires is an elevation of the military caste. The es- sent ial business of empire builders is providing security for parts of the world beyond their own homeland—whether the subject nations want it or not. That is a military exercise. Over time, other forms of business and comm erce are neglected. But military might rests on economic might. People are generally blockheads when it comes to military adventures. Built into their genes is not only the desire to lord it over their neighbors,"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"86 IMPERIA ABSURDUM but also a deep distrust of a nyone who fails to do his duty when the nation is at war. That is one of the things that make empires so attractive. Once underway, they meet with little domestic resistance. As time goes by, not only do other forms of business drop by the wayside, so do other domestic conc erns. Everything gets sacrificed to the war gods—even the liberties for wh ich th ey are meant to be f ighting. All that is needed is a war. For th at, American imperialists have been blessed twice. First, in 1950, began the war against the Evil Empire. It was a nearly perfect military engagement; it threatened every life in America in a tangible, but not immediate, way. Billions of dollars would have to be spent to protect the nation. Everybody and everything m ust be available for conf iscation, should the need arise. Even money th at did not exist— the wealth that future generations had not yet earned— seemed a small price to pay to meet the danger right in front of them. The Ne w York Times of October 31, 1951, noticed the change: ... the Korean War has brought a great and pr obably long-lasting change in our histo ry and our wa y of life ...fo rcing us to adopt mea- sures which are changing the whole American scene and our relations with the rest of the world. ...We have embarked on a partial mobi- lizat ion for which about a hundred billion dollars have been already made available. We have been compelled to activ ate and expand our al- liances at an ultimate cost of some twenty-f ive billion dollars, to press for rearmament of our former enemies and to scatter our own forces at mi litar y bases throughout the world. Finally, we have been forced not only to retain but to expand the draft and to press for a system of uni- versal mi litary training which will affect the lives of a whole genera- tion. The productive effort and the tax burden resulting from these measures are changing the economic pattern of the land. What is not so clearly understood, here or abroad, is that these are no temporary measures for a temporary emergency but rather the begin- ning of a wholly new military status for the United States, which seems certain to be with us for a long time to come. 13 As long as the empire lasts. On the other side of this vast mobilization was another imperial pow er doing its own mobilizing—and for similar reasons. Both were in the protection racket. Both benef ited—in an imperial sense—from the ri- valry. But the Soviet Union’s economy had been so wrecked by its econo-"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"As We Go Marching 87 mists and central planners, it couldn’t keep up. By the 1980s, it was no longer a worthy adversary. By 1989, it came to its senses and got out of the empire busin ess. Dropped tax rates came to an across-the-board 41 percent. 14 And then, went on its way. During the period of the Cold War—from 1950 to 1989, including the hot periods in Korea and Vietnam—the United States spent a total of $5 trillion pr otecting the free world from the Evil Empire. If it had not spent a dim e, the outcome might have been exactly the same—but we cannot know that. What we know is that after the collapse of the Soviet empire, only one was still standing. But it left this American empire in an awkward po- sition. It was in the business of providing protection, but from whom? Ho w could it justify high rates of taxation? How could it continue to em- ploy its military men? For a few years—during the Clinton administra- tion—the nation hesitated. But by 2004, the Pentagon budget was nearly 20 percent greater than it was in 1989. Fortunately for the imperialists, on September 11, 2001, a small group of Muslim terrorists managed one of the most daring and successful attacks in history. With resources no greater than a chemical trace of those of their enemies in the United States, terrorists hijacked commercial air- liners and f lew them into landmark buildings in New York. The event was seen on television around the world. Within hours, George W. Bush an- nounced a new war—against terrorism. This was an absurd stretch, too. Ne ver before had a war been declared against a tactic. It was as if he had gone to war against naval blockades or f ighting on Sunday. Every other empire made war on its enemies or its friends. The Bush administration was ma king wa r on no one in particular, and everyone in general. Every fighting force uses terror at one time or another. Besides, terror could be defined almost any way you wanted, and is only unacceptable so long as it remains unsuccessful. A terrorist who succeeds gets to have tea with the Queen of England, as did Menachim Begin. But none of these issues seemed to matter. In the homeland, scarcely anyone complained. “We are no lo nger able to choose between peace and war. We have embraced perpetual war. We are no longer able to choose the time, the circumstance or t he batt lef ield.” 15 Yo u m a y t h ink that this i saqu otation froma jou rnalist after September 11, 2001.

The comment works"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"88 IMPERIA ABSURDUM forthe ent irep eriod, just as it would have worked for the Romans almost anytime during their 900-year empire. Or for the Mongols or even the British. Garrett leaves us another interesting quote from the period: “Talk o f imminent threat to our national security through the applica- tion of external force is pure nonsense,” said General Douglas Ma cAr thur. “In deed it is a part of the general pattern of misguided pol- icy tha tourcountryisnowgearedtoanarmseconomywhichwasbred in an artif icially induced psychosis of war hysteria and nurtured upon an incessantpropaganda of fear. While such an economy may produce a senseo fseem ing prosperity for the moment, it rests on an illusionary foundation of comp lete unreliability and renders among our political leade rs almost a greater fear of peace than is their fear of war.” 16 Was he speaking in 1952 or 2002? Senator Flanders el aborated in 1951: Fear is felt an d spread by the De partment of Defense in the Pentagon. In part, the spreading of it is purposeful. Faced with what seem to be enormo us armed forces aimed against us, we can scarcely expect the Departm ent of Defense to do other th an keep the people in a state of fear so that they will be prepared without limit to furnish men and mu- nit ions....Another cen ter from which feat is spread is the State De- partment. Our diplomacy has gone on the defensive. The real dependen ces of the State Department is in arms, armies and allies. There is no conf idence left in anything except force. The fearfulness of the Pentagon and that of the State Department complement and rein- force each other. 17 “Senator Flanders missed the point,” says Garrett. “Empire must put its faith in arms. Fear at last assumes the phase of a patriotic obsession. It is stronger than any political party.” 18 Ne ither Flanders nor MacArthur recognized what business America had gotten itself into. As the imperium moves toward a military footing, civil institutions sink. Senators still debate the merits of particul ar items of legislation and still sneak pork-barrel projects into military authorizations, but more and mor e, they become id le windbags rather than real legislators. Even when"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"As We Go Marching 89 they see clearly the drift of the continent, they are powerless to stop it. Garet Garrett mentioned the case of Senator Taft discussing the expenses of the Korean War in March 1950. “I do not know how long this program is going to con tinue. ...We simp le cannot keep the country in readiness to f ight an all-out war unless we are willing to turn our country into a garrison state and abandon all the ideals of freedom upon which this nation has been erected.” 19 Still, Senator Taft was not going to stand in the way of empire. He voted for th e appr opriation s bill. Fifty-f ive years later, the people’s repre sentatives don’t even want to take up the most important issues. Maybe they are too hot to handle. Or ma ybe, somehow, they know that the important issues are beyond them. It is as if some instinct directs people to doing Nature’s own work. Nature will not tolerate an imperial monopoly forever. The empire m ust f ind a way to exterminate itself. No one wants to stand in its way. The two most important public issues of the early twenty-f irst century were the growth of debt in the United States, both public and private, and the stretch of American military resources around the world. Each of these matters had the potential to ruin the imperium itself and gave rise to vital questions. Why are we meddling all over the world? And, how are we going to pay for all the promises we’ve made? Every publicly elected off icial should have posed these questions. But almost none did. Even in 2001, on the matter of war, the United States Constitution was the same as it had been since 1789. “The Congress shall have the pow er to declare war,” it still says. It does not say the presi dent has the powe r. No r the Secretary of the Tr easury or the Postmaster General. It says Congress. We cannot imagine a graver, more serious act than a decla- ration of wa r. We assume that it is just that sort of weight on his shoulders and his conscience that a member of Congress is paid to carry. But when the time came to consider a declaration of war against the lawful govern- ment of Afghanistan and then Iraq, out of 98 members of the Senate, not a single one voted against the use of military force in Iraq, and none asked for a declarat ion of war. Similarly in matters of domestic policy, Congress becomes more and mo re marginalized as the work of empire goes forwa rd. Not that it partic- ularly matters.

The pr eempire forms are still there. But they become meaningless. The executive can do wh at he likes, for he controls the business end of the state: the military. To the extent that it promoted economic progress and prosperity, the Rom an Empire did so by establishing public order and otherwise letting peop le get on with their business. Tax rates pr obably averaged o nly about 5 percent of GDP, even lower than the tribute demanded by the Mongols. But as the imperial bureaucracy develops, it has a tendency to clog up the plumbing of commerce with increasingly detailed controls. One measure causes a backup, which in turn provok es rem ediation by functionaries. Another measure is laid on, which causes even a worse backup. Eventu- ally, p eople are up to their knees. This is what happened in Rome. After clipping the coins in the period from Nero to Diocletian, inf lation seemed out of control. There were more and more coins. It took more of them to buy the same things every year. Finally, Emperor Diocletian announced his Edict of Prices to stop inf lation. Prices for everythin g—including wages—were controlled. The result, as can be imagined, was even worse disaster. By the time of the Nixon administration, the water was rising in America, too. We mention it here not to explore the plumbing but the constitutional system. There is nothing in the United States Constitution allowing a president to f ix prices as though he were a Roman emperor. But that is exactly what Richard Nixon did. The measure was desperate, illegal, and so ill-advised as to be f inancially suicidal. But who opposed it?

We would have to k now what wou ld have happened if the man in the Ov al Office had done something diffe ren t. Would the nation be better off if Lincoln had not slaughtered so many Southerners? Would world history have been worse if Wilson had not meddled in World War I? We can’t know the answers; we can only guess. But the historians who guess about such matters have a disturbing tilt—not toward mediocrity, but toward imbecility. Like crooked butchers, they advertise our biggest mutton- brains as prime beef—and push their thumbs down on the scales of history to give them extra weight. Those they select as great are merely those who have given them the most meat—those who have made the biggest public spectacles of them selves. Most historians rate Lincoln, Wilson, and Franklin Roosevelt as our greatest presi dents. But all of them might just as well have been charged with dereliction,gross incompetence, and treason. For at one time or an- other, each of them betrayed the Constitution, got the country into a war that probably could have been avoided, and practically bankrupted the nation. The presumption that underlies the popular opinion is that a presi dent faces challenges. He is rated on how well he faces up to them. But the biggest chal lenge a president will face is no different from that faced by a Louis or a Charles—merely staying out of the way. People have their own challen ges, their own plans, and their own private lives to lead. The last thi ng they need is a president who wants to improve the world. Every supposed improvement costs citizens dearly. If it is a bridge, it is they who must pay for it, whether it is n eeded or not.

The man was a marvel who could write Latin with one hand and Greek with the other—at the same time. He was shot in July and died three months later. “He didn’t have time to accomplish his plans,” say the standard histories. Thank God. Millard Fillmore was one of America’s greatest presi dents. He did little—other th an try to preserve peace in the period leading up to the Wa r between the States. Preserving peace was an achievement, but in- stead of giving the man credit, historians hold up the humbug, Abraham Lincoln, for praise. The United States has never suffered more harm than on Lincoln’s watch. Still, it is the Lincoln Memorial to which crowds of agitators and malcontents repair, no t the Fillmore Memorial. As far as we know , no monument exists to Fillmore, who not only kept the peace, but also installed the f irst system of running water in the White Ho use—giving the place its f irst bathtub.

In later years, when he came to b eknownbeyondhislocalworld,theword “Roman” was occasionally used in descriptions of him. As he stepped down from the stand, his legs bore out the strik ing and agre eable pro- portions of his body; and his lightness on his feet, his erectness, his easy bearing, added to the impression of physical grace and virility. His suppleness, combined with his bigness of frame, and his large, wide-set rather glowing eyes, his very black hair, and bronze com- plexion gave him some of the han dsomen ess of an Indian. His cour- tesy as he surrendered his seat to the other customer suggested genuine friendliness toward all mankind. His voice was noticeably resonant, masculine, and warm. His pleasure in the attentions of the bootblack’s whisk ref lected a con sciousness about clothes unusual in a small-town man. His manner as he bestowed a tip suggested generous good-nature, a wish to give pleasure, based on physical well-being and sincere kin dliness of heart. 2 No t only did Harding have the looks and the presence, he also had the bad-boy image. Gladwell writes, “Not especially intelligent. Liked to play pok er and to drink ...and m ost of all, chase women; his sexual appet ites were th e stuff of legend.” 3 As he rose from one off ice to the next, he “never distinguished him- self.” His speeches were vacuous. He had few ideas, and those that he had we re probably bad on es. Still, when D augherty arranged for Ha rding to speak to the 1916 Republican National Convention, he guessed what mig ht happen. “There is a man who looks like he should be president,” the onlookers wo uld say. Later that day, in the smoke-f illed rooms of the Blackstone Hotel in Chicago, the power brokers real ized they had a problem. Whom could they f ind that none of them would object to? Well, there was Harding! “Harding became Presi dent Ha rding [in 1921],” writes Gladwell. “He served two years before dying unexpectedly of a stroke. He was, most histo rians agree, one of the worst presidents in Ameri can history.” 4 On the surface, he sounds like one of the best. We have never heard of anyone being arr ested and charged under the “Harding Act.” We have never seen a building in Washington, or anywhere else, named the Hard- ing Building.

Another saving grace was that the president neither thought nor spoke clearly enough for anyone to figure out what he was talking about.

But Freud’s judgment of the man was too generous. Wilson was a self-satisf ied, sanctimonious delusional bungler who practi- cally single-handedly transformed the country into a mocking shell of wh at it was supposed to be. We b e g in our inspection with a quotation attributed to Wilson after his presidential election victory: “Remember that God ordained that I should be the next president of the U nited States. Neither you nor any other mortal or mortals could have prevented this.” Is there any doubt that Wilson was mad? He claimed to be a Democ- rat. Later, he claimed to want to make the world “safe for democracy.” But right here, we see he believed in divine providence to decide leader- ship issues. He had not been elected by the people; he had been chosen by Go d. Wh y then, bother to have elections at all?

What made him think that his own judgment about what sort of government Mexicans should have was better than that of the Me xicans themselves? What made him think that a democracy was supe- rior to a constitutional monarchy or that World War I would end better if Americans got involved in it? In his April 2, 1917, speech, in which he urged the nation to war, Wilson noted that the Russians had always been “democratic at heart.” “[W]onderful, and heartening thing s...have been happening with the last few weeks in Russia,” 9 he con tinued. What had been happening was the beginning of the uprising that would later become the Bolshevik Rev- olution. First, the moderates took over from the Tsar. But the Kerensky government kept Russia in the war. Germany, meanwhile, feared Amer- ica’s entry in the war on the enemy’s side. She desperately needed to sta- bilize the Eastern Front so she could turn her attention to the renewed threat in the West. Her technique was as clever as it was disastrous. She found a windy revolutionary named Lenin who had been exiled from Russia many years before. He was bankrolled, put on a train, and sent bac k into Russia with the express purpose of making trouble. The trouble he m ade was the Bolshevik Revolution, which knocked Russia out of the wa r, just as the Germans had hoped. Wilson had no clue. He had no way of knowing what would happen anywhere. He was guessing, just like ever yone else, and alm ost always guessing wrong. Many readers will rush to judgment. “He made a mis- take,” they will say. Or, “How could a nyone know that the Russian Rev- olution would be followed by one of the most cruel and absurd episodes of bad government in the entire sordid, history of the planet?” Since it is im- possible to know, they will add, “You just have to do your best. ...Be- sides, you have to take action!” The prejudice for action in public affairs is a constant. And a constant disappointment. Of course, Wilson could not know what would happen. It was vain to think otherwise. But Wilson did think otherwise and was determined to edit history before it was written—in Haiti, in Mexico, in Nicaragua and then, when the stakes were bigger, in Europe. He even sent troops to Rus- sia to try to beat back the Bolsheviks. But this was typical of Wilson. He seemed to want to intervene everywhere."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"The Road to Hell 101 THE HALLS OF MONTEZUMA Americans were perfectly happy with the government of Porf irio D’az in Mexic o. But then, the malcontents in Mexico began causing trouble be- cause the most important industries in the country were owned by non- Me xicans. In economic terms it barely matters what passports capitalists carry, but politicians prefer to have locals own local industries, so that they will be closer to hand to lean on. Be yond th at, the Mexicans found foreign ownership a useful spoon with which to stir up the mobs. A new president, Francisco Madero, came in after Porf irio was overthrown in 1910. He immediately went to work trying to dispossess the foreigners— many of whom were Americans. “Give us a dictator we can trust,” the dispossessed said to then-presi dent Ta f t. In February 1913, Madero was overthrown and murdered by Gen- eral Victoriano Huerta. The new American presi dent, Wilson, did not like the latest regime in Mexico and refused to recognize it. Instead, he backed the opposition movement, led by Venustiano Carranza and his Constitu- tionali st party. Wilson said he was following a policy of “watchful wait- ing,” but he must have gotten tired of watching after a while. On April 21, 1914, he dec ided to a ct. He ordered the bombardment of Vera Cruz. Blowing up another country’s city is not an ambiguous act. It is a decisive act of war. The United States Constitution specif ically says that Congress, and only Congress, has the power to declare war. But Wilson couldn’t wait. The Mexican “cr isis” pot had been on a low boil for mont hs. Foreign ships lay off the coast of several Mexican ports awaiting trouble. An inci- dent in Tampico, where a group of Ameri can sailors were detained by Me xican troops, turned up the heat. The sailors were released shortly, with apologies. But Wilson rarely let an opportunity for mishap pass un- mol ested. He demanded that the Huerta government hoist the American flag over Tampico and give a 21-gun salute to atone for the insult. Huerta would have rath er jumped naked into an alligator pond. He refused. Wi lson brought up his marines. But Tampico had no decent place to land them; Vera Cruz was substituted. The proximate reason for Wilson’s attack on Vera Cruz was the ap- proach of a German ship, said to have arms aboard for the Mexican gov- ernment. Mexico was not at war with the United States. The United States was not at war with Germany. No one was at war with a nyone."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"102 WOODROW CROSSES THE RUBICON Mexico could buy its ar ms from whatever country it wanted. Wilson’s in- tervention was fantastic, almost unbelievable. In the battle of Vera Cruz, 90 Americans died and more than 300 Mexi cans. What they died for, no one knew. Wilson’s military meddling quickly produced the exact opposite result than the one he had expected. His man, Carranza, was so appalled he joined forces with his adversary, uniting the entire country against the United States and demanding the remo val of American troops. The Mexican government severed diplo- ma tic relations with the United States and prepared to seize assets of U.S. nationals. Now, the two nations were on the verge of real war. And for wh at? Mr. Wilson had never met either General Huerta or Mr. Carranza, nor as far as we know, had he ever set foot in Mexico, eaten a single taco, or swallowed a single shot of tequila. Yet, the American presi dent thought he knew best who should be head of state south of the Rio Grande. The whole affair ended as preposterously and pathetically as it began. The war in Europe began and Wilson’s wife died. The presi dent no longer had the time or energy to build a better world in Mexico. After a bit of negotiation, Wilson typed up a press release: Bo th Gen eral Carranza and the Convention at Aguascalientes having given the assurances and guarantees we requ ested, it is the purpose of the Administration to withdraw the troops of the United States from Ve r a C r uz on Monday, the twenty-third of Novem ber. All th e pers ons there for whose personal safety this Government had made itself re- sponsible have now left the city. The priests and nuns who had taken refu ge there and for whose safety fears were entertained are on their way to this country. 10 But the Wilsonian intervention was not over. After the settlement of the Ve ra Cruz incident, Wilson backed a rival to Carr anza—a colorful character named Francisco “Pancho” Villa, who once owned a chain of butcher shops. Villa must have been an early role model for Che Guevara. He loved publicity and was accused of staging battles only to get his name in the paper. Hollywood adored h im. If there had been a T-shirt in dustry in 1916, his picture would have been on millions of them. But Villa was not only comic, he was lethal.

The town was burned and 17 Americans were killed in the raid. Before you could say ay Chi- huahua, peop le all over the United States were foaming at the mouth, eager for war. Once again, Wilson gave up watchful waiting and ap- poi nted Gen eral John J. (“Black Jack”) Pershing to bring him the head of Pancho Villa—dead or alive. This, too, was a failure. Despite the call-up of a punitive force of 12,000 soldiers, Pancho always seemed to get away. “V illa is everywhere, but Villa is nowhere,” Pershing told Wilson. Pershing cha sed Villa for nine months. He was called home by Wilson two mon ths before the president announced his plans for a new interven- tion, this time a major league operation. But Villa did not get away for long. He was ambushed several years later and killed. From humbug, to farce, to disaster, Wilson had written the script for nearly all America’s imperial military adventures. The effect of Wilson’s interventions in Latin America ( he had troops in Nicaragua, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic as well as Mexico) was the opposite of what he had hoped for. Instead of increasing friends of the United States in the re- gion, the number of her sworn enemies multiplied. For the next two gen- erations, the expression, “Yanqui go home” was as familiar as frijoles in ma ny Latin American countries. THE GREAT WAR He had a “self-regarding arrogance and smugness, masquerading as righ- teousness,” says historian Paul Johnson of Woodrow Wilson, “which was always there and which grew with the exercise of power.” Like all the great empire builders, Wilson was so sure he was making things bet ter he had no need for the polite constraints of bourgeois society, simple truth, or constitut ional government. Wilson had “a passion for interpreting great event s to the world,” he told his f irst wife. He wanted to “inspire a great mo vement of opinion.” 11 It was not enough to boss around the hidalgos of Latin America; Wilson had an even greater ambition, to lord it over the Europeans, too.

In answer to the question, why did the United States begin meddling in foreign af- fairs in the twentieth century, and not before, comes the easy answer: be- cause it could. On April 2, 1917, Thomas Woodrow Wilson stood before a joint ses- sion of Congress and dazzled the assembly with a torrent of rhetorical air. He had hardly to say a word. The animals were already snorting and paw- ing the ground. The European powers had locked horns. Now, it was America’s chance to join the battle and Wilson’s chance to become alpha male of the entire world. “W e must put excited feeling away,” said the presi dent, and then launched into one of the greatest mob-inciting declarations ever delivered. Wi lson was urging Congress to declare war against Germany. The Huns, he said, were govern ed by a “self ish and autocratic power.” 12 What they had done to justify trying to kill them was a matter of great dispute. Robe rt “Figh ting Bob ” La Follette, senator from Wisconsin, thought they had n’t done muc h of anything. They were accused of b ayoneting babies and cutting off the arms of boys in Belgium. But when a group of Amer- ican journalists went on a fact-f inding mission to get to the truth of the ma tter, they could f ind no evidence of it. Clarence Darrow, the lawyer wh o later made a monkey out of William Jennings Bryan in the Scopes Tr ial, said he would offer a $1,000 reward to a nyone who came forward whose arm had been cut off by the Germans. A thousand dollars was a lot of money back then (this was when the Fed had barely settled down to wo rk), equal to about $20,000 today. Still, no one claimed the money. The Germans had also sunk a few ships. But there was a war going on in Europe. Germany tried to impose a bloc kade of English ports with the only weapon it had, submarines. You took a risk trying to sail into En- gla nd, especially if your ship was carrying ammunition; ever yone knew it. The English were blockading German ports, too. The difference was that the English had a bigger navy and were better at it. There was nothing new about naval blockades. Lincoln had bloc kaded the South during the Wa r between the States. It was a long and complicated story. In retrospect, the United States wo uld almost certainly have been bet ter off by staying out of it. Senator Robe rt La Follette thought so at the time. He told anyone who would lis- ten that the struggle in Europe was best understood as a political and com- merc ial rivalry. The Germans were challenging the English everywhere."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"The Road to Hell 105 The German economy was growing faster. While Germany industrialized muc h later than England, she went about it with typical German thor- oughn ess and energy. Output increased over 600 percent from 1855 to 1913. Whereas Britain’s empire seemed to be peaking o ut, the Germans we re building new factories and developing new markets. As l ate as 1870, Britain was responsible for a third of the entire world’s manufacturing. By 1910, her percentage had fallen in half; Germany and America both pro- duced more. In Africa, German colon ialists were menacing English terri- tories; twice in the years running up to World War I, a cr isis in Africa brought the major powers close to war. In Europe, German manufactur- ers were taking market share from their English compe titors. On the high seas, the German Navy was becoming a bigger and bigger threat to the Royal Navy. An d so, the English and the Germans were f inally having it out. Leave them to it, said Fighting Bob La Follette. But Woodrow Wilson had his own ideas. “Civilization itself ” seemed in the balance, he told the politicians. “We shall f ight for the things we have always carried in our hearts—for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights an d liberties of small nations [he did not mention Mexico, Haiti, or Nicaragua], for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace an d safety to all nations and make the wo rld itself at last free.” 13 When he f inished his speech, most of the members of Congress rose to their feet and cheered. Tears streamed down many faces. At last, the United States was going to war! Two million people had already died in the war. For what reason, no one quite knew. Wilson had to resort to bombast and balderdash to try to explain it. It had been just another fool- ish European war until then—the very sort of war the Founding Fathers had urged their descen dants to avoid. Don’t go forth looking for “mon- sters to slay,” said Adams. But now the happy moment had come. Now, the United States was ready. Wilson had found a monster. Hal lelujah! Un til this date, the war in Europe was just another war in Europe. No t the f irst, and not the last. As recently as 1870, France and Germany had gone at it. France had attacked. Germany counterattacked so bril- liantly, she was able to encircle Paris and lay siege to the city. The United States felt no desire to enter the Franco-Prussian War.

But the money paid over to the Germans was quickly recycled back to the French, from whom the Germans bought goods and services. Losing the war turned out to be as good as winning it; France boomed and Ge rm any, too. Apart from that conf lict, Europe had en joyed an entire cent ury of peace and prosperity. The upper brain might have thought— we ll done, we will hold a steady course. But down in the limbic system, primitive urges were swelling. After such a long period of peace, war might be refreshing. After such a long period of prosperity, they heard the wild call of debt, destruction, and insolvency. On June 28, 1914, the archduke Franz Ferdinand, of the Austro- Hu ngar ian Empire, and his wife were shot and killed by a malcontent named Gavrilo Princip. No one in America particularly cared. For all it matte red out on th e prairie, they would have had the duke stuffed and used as a parlor ornament. Few people had any idea why the Europeans were at war. They had been warned by the Founding Fathers to mind their own business. America had the most dynamic economy in the world; Americans had plenty of busin ess to mind. To sensible people in the United States, minding your own business still seemed like the b est foreign policy. But the editorial pages fulminated with reasons to get into the f ight. Na tionalism, economic competition, militarism, secret treaties, lofty ideals, low-down secret deals, treachery, rivalry—the answers f lew out of the frontal lobe like plastic bags out of a welfare high-rise. Pretty soon, they we re hanging from every tree and electric pole. Even tod ay, you could go from one end of the country to the other asking historians why the United States dec ided to en ter the war or why it entered on the side of England and France instead of on the side of Ger- ma ny and Aust ria.

Th en, as now , nobo dy really knew anything. Brit ain, France, Austria- Hu ngar y, Ru ssia, Germany—all repeatedly misread each others’ intentions, miscalculated the effect of their own actions, and completely misunder- stood what they were getting themselves into. Many people in Europe at the time had been inf luenced by the writings of Norman Angell, who be- liev ed that war was practically impossible. Angell made a good argument. Modern economies are based on trad e, commerce, and manufacture. We alth no lon ger rested on land—which could be seized—but on factories, railroads, capital, and business relationships. War destroys capital and stif les econ omic activity. Therefore, men woul d not make war; it would be too costly, illogical, and unreasonable. Norm an Angell’s book, The Great Illusion, was translated into sev- eral languages and received high praise from many quarters. One of its most v isible admirers was Viscount Esher, chairman of the War Commit- tee in England. Lord Esher gave lectures on the new idea at Cambridge and the Sorbonne. He told listeners that “new economic factors clearly prove the inanity of aggressive wars.” No one would make war, said he, bec ause it would cause such “commercial disaster, f inancial ruin and indi- vidual suffering” that people would naturally turn away from it. The whole idea of modern warf are, he explained, was “so pregnant with re- straining inf luences” that war must soon be a thing of the past. 15 There was also the argum ent that technology inhibits war. At the be- ginning of the twentieth century, Winston Churchill said, “Humanity was informed t hat it could make machines that would f ly through the air . . . “T he whol ep rospect and outlook of mankind grew immeasurably larger ,and them ultiplication of ideas also proceeded at an incredible rate . . . “W hile he nursed the illusion of growing mastery and exulted in his new trappings, he became the sport and presently the victim of tides and currents, of whirlpools and tornadoes amid which he was far more helpless than he had been for a long time.” 16 No t long after the turn of the new century, Orville and Wilbur Wr ig ht demonstrated that the promise of air transportation was real.

Airplanes worked. Three decades after the birth of airplanes, they were over Churchill’s wartime bunker in London, drop ping explosiv es on the city. “W e took it almost for granted that science would confer continual boo ns and blessings upon us,” Churchill explained. But it “was not ac- comp anied by any noticeable advance in the stature of man, either in his mental faculties or his moral character. His brain got no better, but it buzzed the more . . .” 17 Others expected advances in civilization had made war passé. F reud explain ed this sentiment in the spring of 1915: We w e r e prepared to f ind that wars between the primitive and civilized peop les, between the races who are divided by the color of their skin— wa rs, even, against and among the nationalities of Europe whose civi- lizat ion is little developed or has been l ost—would occupy mankind for some time to come. But we permitted ourselves other hopes. We had expected the great world-dominating nations of the white race upon whom the leadership of the hum an species has fallen, who were known to have world-wide interests as their concern, to whose creative powers we re due not only our technical advances toward the control of nature but the artistic and scientif ic standards of civilization—we had ex- pected these peoples to succeed in discovering another way of settling misunderstandings and conf licts of interest . . . 18 Only two of the major combatants in World War I, the United States and France, were democracies, more or less off icially. But all of them we re headed in that direction. In every country, there were parliaments and popular assemblies. Votes were taken. Public opinions were registered. Ne wspapers shouted out the current prejudices and delivered the latest mis information. Heads of state hesitated. Autocrats consulted their minis- ters and advisors. Nowhere in Europe were there any real absolute mon archs. The press, the church, the assemblies, the trade unions, the aristocrats, the bourgeoisie, the industrialists, the bankers, and money- lenders—all had a hearing. After Wilson declared it a “war to make the world safe for democ- racy,” people began to wonder if democracy itself might have prevented the war. Wilson said as much. “Self-governing nations do not f ill their neighbor states with spies,” said the chief executive, not quite anticipating"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"The Road to Hell 109 the CIA. Nor do they begin “cunningly contrived plans of deception or aggression . . .” he added. 19 Ke ren sky, the moderate revolutionary in Russia, declared that democ- raci es never made war on one another. The idea was widely believed at the time, even in America, where two democracies—the North and South— had battered themselves for four years in North America’s bloodiest war ever: the War between the States. Nor did anyone bother to wonder why it was that, before their very noses, the worst war in history was taking place between nations that may not have been complete democraci es, but we re nevertheless more democratic than any in history. Even tod ay, peop le still believe that demo cracies ar e more peaceful than other forms of government. The United States of America maintains that her form of democracy is so important to the peace and prosperity of the world, she not only invites other nations to join her, she insists. And yet the poi nt has hardly ever been serio usly addressed and never proven. What we do know is that since democracy has become widespread, there has been little letup in the incidence of war and probably an increase in its violence. Unlike the subjects of a tyrant or a monarch, the citizens of a democratic regime are more fully and readily engaged in wartime. When people feel threatened, or feel that they have a stake in the conf lict, they are more inclined to devote their energy and resources to victory. Popular newspapers and television work them up to violence easily. Give them the right line of guff and th ey are prepared to hand over their wal- lets as well as their lives. France was able to f inance 83.5 percent of its wartime expenditures by borrowing. Offering national defense bonds in small denominations, France succ eeded, says Hew Strach an, in “mobiliz- ing the wealth of the public.” 20 George Orwell wondered how England could ever triumph over Ge rm anyinW orld Wa rIIsince socialism was so much better at marshal- ing the resources of a people in wartime. What he didn’t realize was that in wartime, England and America quickly took on many of the attributes ofas ocialist society such as rationing, censorship, economic pl anning, and price controls. He also didn’t real ize tha titisnot me rely the percent- age of a society’s output that the state is able to grab that counts; what also ma tters is the total gross amount to grab from. Both of these points we re to become critical to the development of global politics in the twen- tieth century."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"110 WOODROW CROSSES THE RUBICON Approaching the subject from another angle, we ask ourselves: If dem ocra cy was such a good idea, why did people put up with other forms of government for so many hundreds of years? We turn to the dead and ask the question. The answer we get is that most never considered it. Those who did thought democracy a bad system of government. The Greeks invented it. But their democracy was nothing like our def inition of the word. Even America’s founders had a deep mistrust of popu lar dem ocra cy. “Democracies,” wrote James Madison, “have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.” Thomas Jefferson believed that “the majority, oppressing an indi- vidua l, is guilty of a crime, abu ses its streng th ...and br eaks up the foun- dations of society.” After the Revolutionary War was over, the crafter of the Declaration of Independence also argued that “an elective despotism was not the government we fought for.” In the republic they designed and anticipated, few people voted. And then, only for one chamber of the na- tional governm ent: the House of Representatives. The Se nate was chosen by thestates. If it was so apparent that American-style democracy was the best sys- tem of government ever invented, why didn’t the Chinese pick it up? Why did the Chinese never try it in over 4,000 years of civilized commu- nity? Surely someone must have thought of it. And how can we be so sure that it really is the best form of government? Isn’t it an insult to our an- cestors? To the hundreds of generations who never thought of it, or never tried it? And what about all the smart people in all the other countries of the worl d from the moment man f irst stood up on two legs to the day be- fore yesterday—why did they so rarely experiment with such a gloriously successful form of government, which as we all know, not only promotes peace and prosperity, but also lifts man up and ennobles him into the most perfe ct being who ever walked the earth? We have an answer to propose. Democracy is not really God’s choice. It is not real ly a universal constant; it is not perfect for all people at all times. It is merely an evolutionary dev elo pm ent—like a business suit or rap music—sometimes suitable for some people. What has made democ- racy trium ph in the mod ern wo rld is probably that it is bet ter than monar- chy or dict atorship at taking resources from citizens, but rarely takes too muc h.

It is also worth noting that democracy has evolved spectacularly over the past 200 years, and especially since Woodrow Wilson redef ined it. The American system of the twenty-f irst century has no more in com- mon with the system set up by the Founding Fathers than, say, a new Mercedes Maybach has with a Tin Lizzie. In the Great War, almost all the innovations and advances that were thought to prevent war actually made it longer and more brutal—includ- ing democracy. Interlocki ng treaties were said to prevent any one nation from going to war; instead the system brought in more combatants. Modern methods of production were supposed to make war too economically destructive; instead they brought more weapons with greater killing power to the bat- tlefield. Boomi ng economies had the wealth to spend far more on war than ever before, and to sustain the spending for a longer period of time. Me dieval armies could only take the f ield for a few months. After that, they were exhausted. It was also rare for them to make war in bad weather; they simply didn’t have the means to stay at it. Even in modern wars, intensely bad weat her puts an end to the f ighting, as it did every winter in the Wehrmacht’s campaigns in Russia. Modern technology, modern transportation, and modern methods of production all helped put more re sources at the warriors’ disposal. So did modern democracy. The awaken ed an d awakening democracies in all the major war makers in Wo r l d Wa r I brought far more popular participation to the war effort— more money, more resourc es, more soldiers. And all these factors con- tributed toward keeping nations at war for a much longer period. But even with all these things, the ability of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, England, and France to sustain a war was still far more limited than o ne might have thought. Especially in the matter of f inance. Spending in the war exceeded ever yon e’s expectations. After Ger- ma ny defeated France in 1871, it used the money it received from France in settlement to create a war chest of 120 million marks held in the Julius Tow er at Spandau. On the eve of World War I, the amount was doubled to 240 million gold marks, along with an additional 120 million in silver. It seem ed like a lot of money. Yet, in 1913, the Reichsbank f igured that mo bilization alone (to say nothing of wartime losses) would cost 1,800 million marks. Actual expenditure August 1914 was 2,047 million marks. And the war had hardly begun. During the war, Germany’s annual"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"112 WOODROW CROSSES THE RUBICON e xpenditure averaged 45,700 million marks, a sum two hundred times greater than the entire contents of the war chest. And the war continued four years. The situation on the Entente side was little different. The war cost far more than expected and n eeded not only the support of the citi- zenry, but also of the world’s largest democracy—the United States. No one can know for sure what might have happened. But it seems very likely that without U.S. f inancial and material support, the Great Wa r would have ended much sooner. The democratization of the war extended it in another way, as well. The rulers of Britain, Germany, and Russia were all related. Wilhelm II of Germany and George V of England were both grandsons of Queen Victo- ria. Tsar Nicholas II of Russia was married to their cousin. Nicholas was the cou sin of George V through his mother, the Dowa ger Empress Marie. Before the wa r, Wilhelm tried to bring Russia into common cause with Germany, sending him a series of letters addressed to “Nicky,” from “Willy.” Both Willy and Nicky, we soon f ind, were prepared to make war on each other if need be. But neither they, nor their cousin George V, wo uld do so to such an extent as to endanger their empir es, their posi- tions, or destroy the royal houses of Europe. It was precisely because their powe rs had been weakened that the war continued and expanded to such an extent that two out of three of them not only lost their thrones; their royal houses were extinguished completely. We can’t know, but we can imagine that if democracy and Woodrow Wilson had not transformed the wa r into a bigger event, Willy might have written to Nicky and Georgy and called the whole thing off. But it was too late for that. This was a war between peop les, not royal houses. It was already a largely democratic war, in other words, even before Wilson stuck his nose in it. The progressive left steadfastly maintained that growing socialism would also make war impossible. Pacif ism had always been a major headline in the socialist agenda. They saw war as a by-product of capitalist competition and bourgeois nationalism. Both would be eliminated, “come the revolution.” But wh en push cam e to shove, soc ialists in all countries started swinging. The Kerensky government in Russia, after the Tsar’s arrest, dec ided to stay in the war. It called on citizens to f ight: “Peasants and workers, all who de- sire the happiness and welfare of Russia, ...harden your spirits, collect all forces, and when you have defended the country, liberate it.” Later, in World War II, after Russia had been completely liberated, Stalin found that he, too, had to call on atavistic national sentiments to"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"The Road to Hell 113 rally the country behind him. After years of purges, starvation, gulags, and Communist claptrap, the Russians were no longer willing to f ight for socialist ideology. But they would still f ight for the Motherland. Bo th Russia and Germany (and Italy, too) took soft, well-intentioned intellectuals of socialism and put them in uniform. The transformation was a huge success. As an evolutionary strain, National Socialism was muc h more robust and aggressive than the dreamy, internationalist ideal- ism of the Second International. Here again, the results were just the op- posite of what had been expected. In stead of promoting peace, soc ialism became the most militaristic, warmongering creed on the planet. Tw ent y years after World War I, the U.S. government was still scratc hing its head—wondering how it ever got involved in such a point- less and costly exercise. A committee was set up in Congress to look into the matter. Two years later, the Nye Committee reported that between 1915 and April 1917, the United States loaned Germany 27 million dol- lars ($470,000,000 adjusted for inf lation in 2005 dollars). During that same period, U.S. loans to Britain and its allies totaled 2.3 billion dollars ($40,000,000,000 adjusted for inf lation in 2005 dollars). The committee conc luded that Americans had entered the war for comm ercial reasons and on the side of the Allies because it had 85 times as much money at stake. At least the numbers made sense, from the Americans’ point of view. What never quite made sense was why the Europeans went to war in the f irst place. Many unsatisfying books have been written on the subject. The problem is not that they are incorrect or are not useful explanations; they are reasons as good as any. It is just that they are not suff ic ient. Look- ing back nearly 100 years later, we can’t see what people got so worked up abo ut. It might just as well have been a religious war, a War of the Roses, or the crusade again st the Albigensians. Wa r i s r a r e ly taken up with a cool head. And looking in the head for reasons is as futile as looking for dignity on television. A bet ter place to look is in the heart. Once the mob’s sentiment is roused for war, there is practically no stopping it. Mass emotions—whether in the stock market or in war—are infectious. In practically no time, the whole population clam- ors for uniforms and murder. “My darling One and beautiful . . .” Winston Churchill began a letter to his wife on July 28, 1914, “Everything tends toward catastrophe, and col- lapse. I am interested, geared-up and happy.” 21 What a rush of excitement"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"114 WOODROW CROSSES THE RUBICON swept through Europe in the summer of 1914. Som ething new. Some- thing big. Something magnificent was underway. “Strangers spoke to one another in the streets,” wrote Stefan Zweig. The Austrian author was a Jew. Later, he would f lee another mass move- ment, but this one, in 1914, he found to his tastes: “People who had avoided each other for years shook hands, everywhere one saw excited faces. Each individual experienced an ex altation of his ego, he was no longer the isolated person of former times, he had been incorporated in too the mass, he was part of the people, and his person, his hitherto unno- ticed person, had been given m eaning.” 22 There’s nothing like a good war to give meaning to empty lives. “W ar is the health of the state,” Bismarck had said. 23 The European states never felt better than at the beginning of World War I. The words of politicians were reported in all the papers. People who would otherwise never been noticed by the mass es, were treated as though they were rock stars or sports heroes. Young men lined up to volunteer in the state’s armies. Young women joined nursing associations, whose goals were not to take care of people, but to f ix up the injured warriors so they could re- turn to battle as quickly as possible. Mothers were honored for their will- ingness to sacrif ice sons to the war effort. Even factory workers were encouraged to think of their work as noble, even glorious—for they were supplying the materiel that made the war possible. Suddenly, ever yone had a job to do, an important job. There was a sense that a war would be good for the spirit and maybe the soul. Poets longed for war to end the “opulence of peace.” They saw them selves as suffering from bourgeois prosperity—growing pale, rotting at desks, growing effete over polite dinner conversation. “Today’s man,” wr ote Dezso Kosztolanyi just after the war broke out, “. . . grown up in a hothou se, pale and sipping tea—greets this he althy brutality enthusiasti- cally. Let the sto rm come and sweep out our salon s.” Philosopher Max Scheler welcomed the war as “an almost metaphysical awakening from the empty existence of a leaden sleep.” Wyndham Lewis wrote that “killing som ebo dy must be the greatest pleasure in existence: either like killing yourself without being interested by the instinct of self-preservation—or exterminating the instinct of self-preservation itself.” While the intellectuals saw the war as “deadly enlivening” to use Rainer Rilke’s phrase, the common men and women were titillated, too.

F reud remarked that his libido had been mobilized for war. The leaders had their own private joys and sorrows ...and their own empty lives to f ill. Wilson’s f irst w ife died in early 1914. German Chan- cellor, Theobald von Bethm ann-Hollweg’s wife had died in May 1914. Wo uld he have been so ea ger for war in July if she had still been alive in June? General Count Franz Conrad von Hotzendorf longed to be a war hero, it was said, so he could win the heart of his beloved Gina von Rein- ingha us, inconven iently married to someone else. And poor Kaiser Wil- helm, would he have been bet ter at avoiding war if his mother had not rejected him? (The Kaiser had a withered arm, said to be the cause of his mo ther’s coldness toward him.) Wilhelm was “not quite sane,” in the judgment of more than one observer at the time. “The Kaiser is like a bal- loo n,” Bismarck had said of him. “If you don’t hold onto the string you never know quite where he will be off to.” 24 Why look for the causes of such a preposterous war deep in the isms that f ill history books? The real causes are closer at hand—in the pompous twit of a pedant like Wilson or the bluster of Theodore Roosevelt or in Wi lhelm’s insecure strut and Bethmann-Hollweg’s broken heart. They, and millions more, found the prospect of a short, sanitary war charmingly distracting. WIL SON’S WAR America had no dog in the European f ight. During his reelection battle of 1916, Woodrow Wilson correctly read the public mind. “He kept us out of war,” was hi s campaign slogan. But there was no glory in sitting on the sidelines. Wilson longed to get into it and imagined that he could transform the war—and the world that came out of it—in his own image. First, it would be a world war, not one conf ined to the Europeans. And, second, it would have a high-minded pur- pos e: to free the world from tyranny. Never before had such a bloody enter- prise been undertaken for what appeared to be such a high-minded reason. The reasons were just f luff. The real reasons were the same sordid, comp lexi nstincts that always lure people to war and ruin. Even the dumbest species have their alphas and omegas—their lead dogs and their drones and mules."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"116 WOODROW CROSSES THE RUBICON “If it a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall f ight for the things we have always carried in our hearts,” said Wilson. “T o such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, ever ything that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured. God helping her, she can do no other.” 25 Wi th this last whoosh of inf lated language, the empty bubbles of Mr. Wi lson’s rhetoric practically exploded. Since the Gettysburg Address, no one in American history had said such a preposterous thing in public that wasn’t followed by contemptuous laug hter. But it was hardly the last time Americans were to hear such things. In 1961, Presi dent Kennedy offered another blank check to the forces of improvement: “We will pay any price, bear an y burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty.” 26 (Science may be cumulative, but war, f inance, and love operate in cy- cles. After 14 years of paying for the Vietnam War, Americans f igured it was time to retrench. Richard Nixon addressed the sentiment of the time at his inauguration in 1973: “The time has passed when America will ma ke every other nation’s conf lict our own, or make every other nation’s future our responsibility, or presume to tell the people of other nations how to manage their own affairs.” 27 Nixon was wrong. The time had not passed—it was hardly beginning.) A cynic might dismiss Wilson’s high-mindedness as pure claptrap. But it was more than that. The professor of government had managed to take an idea and turn it inside out. He now proposed to waste America’s blood on wh at was practically the exact opposite of the “principles that gave America birth” and squander the happiness and peace she treasured in the process. The Founding Fathers couldn’t have cared less about whether Germany or England won the war, to say nothing of the government structure in those countries. They almost certainly would have despised Wi lson’s busybodying. If they had been subject to the Espionage and Sedi- tion Acts that Wilson put in place to stif le criticism, they pr obably would have revolted all over again."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"The Road to Hell 117 Then, as now, critics hacked away at the limbs and branches of Wil- son’s war fever. What else could they do? They challenged the leafy rea- son s. None could get at the noxious roots. After Wilson’s speech, practically every member of Congress was on his feet. Amid yelps and war whoops, the world’s greatest deliberative body convulsed with excitement. Finally, the war was on. But there was one important exception: Senator Robert La Follette. A found er of the Progressive Party, La Follette was one of the reasons Wo o d r o w W i l s on w as elected in the f irst place. The progressives split the Re pub lican Party vote in two, leaving Wilson—the Democrat—with a 42 perc ent majority, and so he won on a f luke. La Follette represented Wis- consin, with a large German-American population. But his resistance to war fever seemed to come from his own resourc es; he held to it longer than politically necessary. He argued against it so strongly that his col- leagues thought he was committing political suicide. Many couldn’t help but wond er: Is La Follette mad? According to some papers, he was a “B enedict Arnold.” He was a “Judas Iscariot,” said others. St udents at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) burned him in eff igy, and wh en La Follette left the Capitol after giving his spirited chal lenge to the war, another colleague handed him a rope. But Fighting Bob was not easily bullied, not even after Senator Ollie James of Kentucky rushed at him with a gun in hand. Fortunately for the Wisconsin delegation, Se nator Harry Lane of Oregon attacked James with a f ile and several other senators tackled him. Peop le we re in no mood for question marks. The questions typically come later. In a bubble, or an empire, things that would seem prep oster- ous and absurd under other circumstances—stocks at 200 times earnings, getting yours elf killed for no apparent reason—become commonplace. Dou bt and skepticism give way to fever. “Itisn ot imefor criticism of the president, of the cabinet, of Con- gress. ...ItistimeforonehundredpercentAmeri canism,” said the sage Senator William Squire Ke nyon of Iowa. He might have said that it was time to get drunk and dance naked around a f ire. The leading politicians we re readyfor anything as long as it was h ysterical. By this time, the super- patriots were out in force and cranked up to 150 percent Americanism.

In Tulsa, Oklahoma, a crowd hauled a Bulgarian immigrant out of a bar and lynched him. They mistook him for a German. All over the coun- try, people declared they hated Germans, though none knew why. People chan ged their names to avoid sounding too Teutonic. The Ne w York Tri- bune carried a phony story about a German factory that had been con- verted to turn corpses into soap. Nothing was too absurd. (Even after the war, the momentum of hatred took years to halt.) The British con tinued their blockade of German ports and tightened it after the Armistice was declared. Thousands of Germans—especially chil- dren—starved to death. One British journalist visited a maternity hospital in Cologne. He found “rows of babies fe verish from wa nt of food, ex- hausted by privation to the point where their little limbs were like slender wa nds, their expressions hopeless, and their faces full of pain.” But so wh at, said Clemenceau. There were 20 million too many Germans any- way, reasoned the French premier. Finally, at 4 PM on April 4, two days after the presi dent’s appeal for wa r, Senator La Follette took the f loor of the Se nate. Why should Con- gress get behind the presi dent, he wanted to know? Wilson had been wr ong about other things, mightn’t he be wrong again? What about the charge that Germany was sinking ships? Isn’t that what nations at war are supposed to do? England had put on a blockade of Ge rm any. Ge rm any had retaliated with its own bloc kad e. American ships could respect the blockades or not. But they shouldn’t meekly consent to the En glish blockade of German ports while being indignant about Ger- ma ny’s blockade of England. La Follette spoke for two hours and 45 minutes. He ended with tears streaming down his face, for he knew that his words were not enough. He might have been expl aining to a pack of hounds why they should let the rabbit go. According to Gilson Gardner, it was “the best speech we will ...ever hear.” But blood was up all over America already. It didn’t ma tter what La Follette said. He was wasting his breath.

Yet, Belgium was not really neu- tral at all; she had signed a secret agreement with Britain. Germany had started the war, said the Wilsonians. But on the evidence, the Huns no more want ed war than anyone els e. The Kaiser himself had tried to stop it. The war began amid a f lurry of troop mobilizations, ulti- ma tums, and declarations of war on all sides. Who was really guilty of hav- ing begun the war? Who was the aggressor? Albert Einstein signed a declaration asserting that Germany was inno- cent. It had not broken international law by invading Belgium, said the text. Nor had Germany committed atrocities against the civilian popula- tions of France and Belgium. In fact, the declaration went on to say that the future of European civilization depended on a German victory. And practically every professor at every German university agreed. Even old enemies admitted, after the fact, that Germany was no more to blame than anyone else. Lloyd Geor ge, Britain’s former prime minister, began his memoirs in 1933 by stating that nobody wanted the Great War and nobody expected it. Instead, the nations of Europe merely “slithered over the brink.” 28 Now , America was preparing to slither over the brink, too. Only La Follet te and a handful of skeptics stood in her way. Th ep resident claimed that Germany’s submarine blockade of England consti tuted a “war against all nations.” Why then, La Follette, wanted to know ,w as the United States the only one that objected to it? All of Scandi- navia, Latin America, Spain—all the world’s nations were affected in ex- actlythe same way. Bu tnotas ingle one of them even protested Germany’s dec ision. Certainly, none of them saw the action as a declaration of war. And then, there was the claim that Germany was under the heel of a “Prussian autocracy.” So what, La Follette might have said. What business is it of ours how Germany governs herself ? The Wisconsin senator guessed that th e average German was more likely to back his govern- ment’s war effort than Am ericans were to back Wilson’s intervention in Germany’s war. And if Wi lson was sure of the contrary, let him prove it. Put the matter to a referendum. But America’s entry into what became World War I was never sub- jected to a popular vote.

With little more debate, the U.S. Congress voted to back the presi den t. Only one member, apart perhaps from La Follette, seems to have had any idea wh at was at stake. Wi lliam J. Stone, of Missouri, told his colleagues: “I won’t vote for this wa r because if we go into it, we will never again have this same old Re- public.” 29 The newspapers practically accused him of treason. Stone wa sright; but that was the point of the war, to make the United States into an empire. Wilson was proposing to c ross the Atlantic as Alexander had crossed the Hellespont and Caesar had crossed the Rubicon. Every great public movement—and almost every empire—begins in dec eit, dev elo ps into farce, and ends in disaster. Wilson’s war was no dif- ferent. The idea of maki ng the worl d safe for democracy was pure hum- bug. The Europeans had been f ighting for two years. If it was a f ight for dem ocra cy, it came as news to them. After the f ighting was over, the French and English laughed at Wilson and ignored his Fourteen Points whenever they conf l icted with their own interests. “Mr. Wilson bores me with his Fourteen Points,” said Clemenceau, puncturing the American’s bub ble, “Why God Almighty only has ten.” 30 The American presi dent was appalled and humiliated; he suffered a stroke and never recovered. Was the world any safer for democracy at the end? Not on the evi- den ce. Just the opposite; in the aftermath of the war, and Wilson’s inept settlem ent, arose democracy’s most aggressive and ruthless o pponents— me n who had ambitions to empire themselves and few scruples about how to achieve it.

Aging generals loo kedtothe lessons of the American War between the States or the Franco- Prussian War of 1870 for clues as to how the war might proceed. But there we re no precedents for what was to happen. It was a new era in warfare. People were already familiar with the prom ise of the mach ine age. Th ey had seen it coming, developing, building for a long time. They had even changed the language they used to ref lect this new understanding of how things work ed. In his book, Devil Take the Hindmost, Edward Chancellor recalls how the railway inv estment mania had cau sed people to talk about “getting up steam” or “heading down the track” or “being on the rig ht track.” 31 All these new meta pho rs would have been m ysteriously nonsensical prior to the Industrial Age. The new technology had changed the wa y people thought and the way they spoke. Wo r l d Wa r I showed the world that the new paradigm had a deadly power beyond what anyone expected. At the outbreak of the war, German forces followed Alfred von Schli- effen’s plan. They wh eeled from the north and drove the French Army be- fore the m. Soon the French were retreating down the Marne Valley near Par i s. And it looked as though the Germans would soon be victorious. The Germa ngene rals believed the French were broken. Encouraged, Gen eral von Kluck departed from the plan; instead of taking Paris, he de- cided to chase the French Army, retreating adjacent to the city, in hopes of destroying it completely. But there was something odd; there were rel- atively few prisoners. An army that is breaking up usually throws off lots of prisoners. As it turned out, the French Army had not been b eaten. It was re- treating in good order. And when Galieni, the old French general, saw wh at was happening—German troops moving down the Marne only a few miles from Paris—he uttered the famous remark, “ Gentlemen, they offer us their f lank.” Galieni attacked, driving soldiers to the front line in Paris taxicabs. The Germans were beaten back and the war became a trench-war night- mar e of machine guns, mustard gas, barbed wire, and artillery. By the time the United States entered the war, the poet Rupert Brooke was already dead, and the life expectancy for a soldier on the front lines was just 21 days.

There was no glory left, just tears. Another poet ’s mother got the sad news on Armistice Day. A telegram arrived informing the family that Wilfred Owen had been killed. Coming as it did on the day the war ended, t he news m ust have brough tmorethan just grief. “What was the point?” they must have wondered. Wi lfred Ow en had wondered, too. His poetry mocked the glory of war. He described soldiers who had been gassed as “gargling” their way to death from “froth-corrupted lungs.” Owen saw many men die; it was nei- ther sweet nor glorious, he observed, but ghastly. It doesn’t seem q uite right that so many people should have died for nothi ng. People can’t stand the idea. It leaves a hole, a huge gap that the brain l abors to f ill. Otherwise, the deaths have no m eaning. It is not enough to appreciate bravery and self-sacrif ice for its own sake. It must ma ke sen se. So, bring out the humbug! We found ourselves in Canada’s mar itime provinces in November 2004, reading the paper. “Don’t forget to spend a moment on Remembrance Day,” the Canadian Broadcasting Co mpa ny rem inded readers, “to recall those many Canadians who died protecting our liberty and our country.” No t even the maddest of the Wilsonians would have suggested that No rth Americans’ liberty was at stake. The Huns were not going to cross the Atlantic to attack New Brunswick or New York. What did the Yanks and Canucks have at stake? Nothing at all. But people f ind it easier to die than to think; and for most people, it is pr obably preferable. The paper reported that one of the last Canadian World War I veter- ans had just died at 106 years old. There were only 10 left. ( In France, there were 36 still with a pulse as of November 2004.) The old soldiers are dying fast. Canadian soldiers were among the best colonial troops, said the press report, and the most likely to be killed. If dying in war is sweet, the New- foundlanders got the most cavaties. One out of 4 of the 6,000 men of the Ne wfoundl and Regiment never returned home. But “nothing matched the toll of the massacre at Beaumont-Hamel on the western front on July 1, 1916,” reports the Toronto Globe and Mail. “About 800 Newfound- landers charged out of their trenches into the teeth of German machine- gunf ire.

In the small villages of France hardly a family was spared. Every small town has its monument in a central location to No s He ros...Mort Pour La Fr ance. Often, the list of names seems longer than the pre sent popula- tion. And still people wonder, what happened? We can turn to Wilson’s bogus explanation ...or any one of hundreds. The capitalists are to blame! It’s the Germans fault! If only European nations had been democ- racies! If only Princip had missed his mark! But there is another way to understand the Great War: A bull market in death began in August 1914; it pr obably would have ended in 1916 or 1917 but for the fresh new resources of the United States. Wilson longed to give the war meaning by using it to turn America into a world- improving, hegemonic power. All he had to do, he thought, was to pre- vent an early settlement of the war giving him time to help the French and English win a total victory rather than a negotiated peace. Then, he bel ieved, he wou ld be the true victor. He could come to Europe like an archa ngel at a Catholic-school picnic. He would walk across the Atlantic and impose his Fourteen Points on the world as if they were written on clay tablets and had been handed to him by God. MAKI NG TH E WORLD SAFE FOR DEMOCRACY When Woodrow Wilson stood before Congress and asked for a declaration of war against Germany, the word s came out of the advanced part of the brain. They were the nice, multisyllabic, Latinate words you would expect from a form er profes sor of government. They were not simple, honest wo rds, but greasy and meaningless ones, also just what you would expect. It was the kind of bosh you f ind on a typical high-minded editorial page. It was as if the president opened his mouth and brightly colored bubbles popped out. Airily ...lightly...they fl oated above the crowds, who craned their necks upward in admiration and awe. They didn’t seem to mind that the wo rds we re empty.

Had the upper brain been allowed to do its wo rk, surely it would have told him that if he wanted to make the world safe for democracy, he ought to ask some questions of the nation that held it in check. As a matter of logic he might just as well have entered the war on the side of Germany ag ainst England. But buried deep in the president’s sly brain were idealized pictures of the Magna Carta, the robes and wigs of English judges, High Tea at the Savoy, Dickens and Thackeray—all the trappings of the English upper classes as they were imagined by a naïve and admiring college professor from Princeto n, New Jersey. The president, his advisors, his cabinet, and his le ading allies had such bad cases of anglophilia, they practically stut- tered and drooled. And when they stirred the mob with big words, the gaudy balloons they sent aloft meant nothing more than a signal that the fight had begun. The poor s chmucks’ blood was up already. All it took was a reason and they were ready to die. A moment of real thought by f iring a few synapses in the upper lateral prefrontal cortex would have shown what a losing proposition the Euro- pean war would likely be. But whatever thinking was taking place was dee per down in the limbic system, not in the lateral prefrontal cortex. Wilson had already made his decision. And the public, too, was soon eng aged. The cannons were drawn up. Medals were polished. In no time at all, people were on their knees pledging all they had to the war effort, giving up their purses, their sons, and their integrity. Around the country, superpatriots were drilling holes through their walls so they could spy on neigh bors wi th names like Bauer and Feldgenhauer.

Wo rld War I turned out to be a catastrophe as meaningless and sense- less as Wilson’s words. We look at it here, because it marks the beginning of the U.S. imperium. It helps explain today’s world. Now, as then, the yahoos cheer a new group of “Wilsonian” off icials. Once again, they think they are making the world safe for democracy. Once again, they be- lieve that almost no price is too heavy for the benef its of the better world they imagine. And once again, they soften up the nation’s heads and its money to pay for it. But it is not the same world that we had in 1917. It is Wilson’s world now , the world he helped to make. America is no longer the rising power; China is rising now. America is in Britain’s World War I position, trying to hold on to its commercial edge against newer, more aggressive rivals. Americans are no longer lean and hungry for work and prof it; now they are the fattest people on the planet and have grown used to living off the hard work of others. “Virtue is what used to pay,” said Gordon Tullock. But what used to pay for Americans were the virtues of hard work, thrift, self-discipline, and minding their own business. Americans were virtuous until Wilson took over. Since then, they have given up on what used to pay in favor of what see ms to pay now—meddling, borrowing, and spend- ing—overseas as well as at home. In the private sphere, a delusional man is soon impoverished, friend- less, powerless, and hopeless. All he can do at that point is run for public office: Because in public life, foolish arguments have fewer and less imme- diate consequences. It is in public life, that people get carried away with reason. “History is an argument without end,” said Pieter Geyl. One na- tion argues that it must dominate its neighbors because it needs “living room.” Another says it has a manifest destiny to do so. One public leader says he must create a “co-prosperity sphere.” Another says he will make the world sa fe for democracy. None of these f lourishes are rooted in logic or reason, but in the rich, fetid loam of the heart. Within every world improver and empire builder l urks a vain ani- ma l—displaying his tail feathers.

PAY I NG FOR WA R No thi ng sof tens money up as fast as war. The shells pound it. The bullets puncture it. Armies march on it. And politicians and central bankers stretch it out to the point that it inevitably breaks. In July 1914, all the major bellige rents were on the gold standard— along with 44 other countries. The system was simple and effective. It had fostered an international f inancial climate so conducive to the growth of capital and trade that most of the West had never been more p rosperous. Cent ral banks of the various nations held gold in their coffers. The gold was used to back up the paper currencies. If a nation spent too much on external products, its currency f lowed to foreign countries. It came back in payment for either goods or services supplied by the home country. In the ev ent of an imbalance, that is to say when a foreign nation found itself with more of th e nation’s currency than it could spend on goods and ser- vices from that nation, the resulting surplus currency was pre sented to the central bank to be replaced by gold. Every nation’s imbalances were set- tled in the one thing that none of them could print or counterfeit: gold. If a nation ran a persistent trade def icit, it would f ind its gold pulled away. This would encourage the central bank to do something to protect it. Usually, interest rates rose, which had the effect of rewa rding savings and dis couraging the outf low of funds. The system was neat. It was hon est. Which made it ill-suited to the needs of war and empire-builders. War, particularly, was distressingly ex- pensive. Politicians noticed—as monarchs had long ago—that people might be enthralled by the cannon f ire, but they hated to pay for it. Typ- ically, according to R. S. Hamilton-Grace, who studied English war f i- nancing, about a third of the cost of war had to be covered by borrowing. Gold was famously uncooperative. It yi elded neither to f lattery nor to technology. You couldn’t pretend i twasworthmorethanitwas.Andyou couldn’t create more “out of thin air.” Each ounce n eeded to be dug up out o ftheeart h—at considerable expense.

If they wanted more, it had to come from somewhere. It had to be saved, put away, stored. The old ex- pression, “you can’t get something for nothing,” seemed to have been coined to desc ribe the yellow metal. Every ounce of it repre sented an ounceo fthrift, a pound of self-discipline, and a ton of forbearance. It rep- resented money that had not been spent on new clothes, or guns, or food, or entertainment, lodging, tools, roads, or a million other potential uses. Gold was so hard to get that central banks were r eluctant to let it go. Kings used to castrate the keepers of their royal mints if they let the gold slip away, either through chicanery or lack of attention. Central bankers were naturally careful with the stuff; caution was in their blood. They knew that if they issued too much paper—that is, if they allowed too many claims against their horde of gold—they risked having it taken from them. On the other hand, war also was a serious matter. And central banks we re asked to help f inance the war. This diff icult position was made even wo rsein1914 when the threat of war caused a drop in stock prices—wip- ing out much of the liquidity that might be sopped up for wartime f inance. The European nations n eeded to borrow vast amounts to cover the war ex- penses. But each additional unit of currency further reduced the gold cover, or the ability of the borrowing nation to pay its debts with real money. Re aders will be quick to notice the parallels to the global f inancial system of 2005. The Europeans wanted to increase the consumption of wa rm ateriel. Now, Americans consume other things as if they were fighting fortheir lives. Cannons and bullets were not much diffe rent from big-screen TVs and automobiles; they were quickly used up with no eco- nomicp rogress to show for it. From 1914 to 1918, France and Britain needed U.S. f inancing to conduct war be yond their means. Now, Amer- icaturns to its principal suppliers in Asia and asks for credit. Without it, theU nited States cannot continue consuming at its pre sent r ate. In 1914, thew orld’s most important supplier was the United States. France, Britain, and Russia (and to a much lesser extent, Germany, early in the wa r) had to turn to the United States for supplies. But since they con- sumed more than they earned, they put their gold reserves at risk. France dealt with this problem early o nbysimplygoingoffthegoldstandard. Britain remained on the gold standard throughout the war, barely, but only by the grace of U.S. creditors. Fortunately for Britain, the United States did not force the issue. (Fortunately for America 90 years later, its major creditors in Asia do not"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"128 WOODROW CROSSES THE RUBICON seem to want to force the issue either—at least, not yet. Even without a gold standard, China and Japan could wreak havoc with the dollar any time they chose. For the moment, like America in 1914 to 1916, they are happy to take the orders and increase market share, knowing that their ma jor customer cannot really afford to pay for all that they send her.) As the war grew more and more grim, not only was the hon est money of the gold standard abandoned by most bellige rents, the export of gold to settle accounts was expressly forbidden (under cover of fear that the gold would fa ll in to enemy hands). Each nation began increasing its supply of money, i ssuing more paper currency, borrowing more and more money from foreign (mostly American) and domestic sources, and spending far beyond its means. France was already heavily in debt when the war began, with a consol- idated debt in July 1914 of 27,000 million francs, in arrears already by 967 million. Normally, the French assembly resisted—however weakly—plans to spend more money. But with war cries in their ears and the Huns at the Somme, the peoples’ representatives got in the ha bit of merely rubber- stamping any requ est that came their way. They voted for credits of 22,804.5 million francs in 1915—an amount that rose every year, reaching 54,537.1 million in 1918. In practice, the government spent far more than the credits that had been voted, using special accounts that we might call “off budget” accounts similar to those used by the Bush administration to pay for the war in Iraq. In 1920, 30,000 million francs—an amount nearly equ al to the nation’s entire prewar debt—passed through the special ac- counts (see Figure 5.1). When America entered the war, its expenditures outdid the other combatants, averaging $42.8 million per day from July 1917 until June 1919. Total federal expenditure rose 2,454 percent in the three years 1916 to 1919. The Federal Reserve issued more and more paper no tes; the sup- ply rose by 754 percent between March 1917 and December 1919. The overall money supply increased 60 percent between 1913 and 1918, while GDP increased only 13 percent. The government raised money pa rtly by taxing p eople much more heavily and partly by borrowing from them. Four “Liberty Loans” were f loated during the war years. At the war’s end, a “Victory Loan” was offered. All of this borrowing, spending, and taxing left the world’s major econom ies—especially those in Europe—very fragile.

In his book The Decline of the American Republic, Flynn observed that Americans needlessly “live in the war-torn, debt-ridden, tax-harried wrec kage of a once imposing edif ice of the free society which arose out of the American Revolution on the foundation of the U.S. Constitution.” 1 An empire needs a source of income suff icient to fund its military campaigns, regulatory regimes, and domestic schemes. It also needs a strong central authority to direct its ambitious new programs. In one short 12-month span, a year the writer Frank Chodorov calls the “Revolution of 1913,” the empire got the tools it needed. That year—the same year European countries abandoned the gold standard in preparation for World Wa r I—the old Republic ceased to exist.

In its f irst 100 years, the United States supported its federal government with a series of what we would call “sin taxes” today, on whiskey, tobacco, and sugar. By 1817, all internal taxes were abolished by Co ngress, leaving only tariffs on imported goods as a means for support- ing the government. The f irst income tax that citizens of the young Republic were forced to endure came about because Congress had been asked to fund the War be- tween the States. In 1862, a tax on incomes between $600 and $10,000 was assessed at the rate of 3 percent, and the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS) was created. The war was costing $1.75 million per day. 2 The government sold off land, borrowed heavily, enacted various fees, and increased excise taxes, but it simply wasn’t enough. The income tax seemed like the only way to f inance the war and service the country’s then-staggering $505 mil- lion debt. That tax was promoted as a temporary wartime measure. Tempo- rary it was. In 1872, after servicing the Reconstruction, Congress yanked the “temporary” tax. But that was not the end of it. The income tax appealed to empire builde rs bec ause it alone offered enough cash to f inance the enterprise. But it had another appeal—to the larceny and envy in the hearts of ordi- nary citizens. Following a banking panic in 1893, Senator William Peffer of Kansas, supported the progressive income tax in this way: We alth is accumulated in New Yo rk, and not because those men are mo re industrious than we are, not because they are wiser and better, but because they trade, because they buy and sell, because they deal in usury, because they reap in what they have never earned, because they take in and live off wh at other me n earn....The W est and the South have made you people rich. 3 Th at sentiment was puffed up by Nebraska’s bellicose world- improver William Jennings Bryan, who argued against the “equal taxa- tion” requirement in the Constitution, in favor of the current progres- sive one: If Ne wY orka nd Massachusetts pay more tax under this law than otherstates, it will be because they have more taxable incomes within their borders. A nd why should not those sections pay most which enjoym ost? 4"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"The Revolution of 1913 and the Great Depression 133 This logic is simp le. People who are more productive should be forced to pay a bigger share of their common expenses. But this kind of logic had no place in a free republic where all men were supposedly cre- ated equal; if they were equal they could each carry their own share of the b urden of central government. Under this new regime, men were no longer equal, but given differing loads to carry based on the whims of elected hacks. Wi th con siderable foresight, one member of the House of Repre senta- tiv es predicted: The imposition of the [income] tax will corrupt the people. It will bring in its train the spy and the informer. It will necessitate a swarm of officials with inquisitorial powers. It will be a step toward central- izat ion. ...It br eaks another canon of taxation in that it is expensive in its collection and cannot be fairly imposed ...and, finally, it is con- trary to the traditions and principles of republican government. 5 When the tax was again introduced in 1894, a chal lenge went to the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1895, even among the caco phony of appeals in Co ngress to “soak the rich,” the Supreme Court declared the bill uncon- stitutional in a 5-to-4 ruling. In writing the majority opinion, Justice Stephen J. Field quoted another case to support his conclusion: As stated by counsel: “There is no such thing in the theory of our na- tional government as unlimited power of taxation in congress. There are limitations, as he justly observes, of its powers arising out of the es sential nature of all free governments; there are reservations of individual rights, without which society could not exist, and which are respected by every government. The right of taxation is subject to these limitations.” 6 But when the winds of empire blew, the old yellowed paper of the U.S. Constitution went f lying. Following The Panic of 1907, Presi dent Theo dore Roosevelt sided with a faction in the Democratic Party that wa nted to amend the Constitution to allow a national income tax. In 1909, Presi dent Taft stated that he had “become convinced that a great majority of the p eople of this country are in favor of vesting the National Government with power to levy an income tax.” 7 Of course, politicians are always able and willing to argue that “the people” want a government to have more power.

By 1913, just in time for Wilson’s emer- gence on the world stage, the Sixt eenth Amendment had been ratif ied by enough states to put the income tax into law. The Amendment states: The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from wh atever source derived, without apportionment among the sev- eral states, and without regard to any census or enumeration. 8 It wasn’t long before Congress exercised its new powers. Wilson even convened a special session of Congress to rush through the f irst tax law under the Sixteenth Amendment, in which earnings above $3,000 were subject to a 1 percent tax, gradually moving up to 7 percent on higher in- come levels. Wi th its rather modest rates, the original income tax was viewed as a ben ign inconvenience. As early as 1916, however, the top rate was more than doubled from 7 percent up to 15 percent. Then as cash was needed to send Pers hing to France, the rate was hiked to a staggering 67 percent in 1917 and 77 percent by 1918. Even the low rates were raised. From their microscopic origin of only 1 percent, the rate settled into a “modest” 23 percent by the end of World War II. But by that time, the people of the old republic had grown to acce pt an income tax as a necessary evil. Now that the nation was an empire, it needed the money. In our present era, the complexity of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC ) has created an army of spec ialized lawyers and accountants. Even attempts at reform are out of control. A “technical corrections” bill ex- ceed s 900 pages of adjustments. In fact, by the beginning of the twenty- f irst century, the tax codes exceeded 7 million words, about nine times longer than the Bible; and the IRS was sending out about 8 billion pages of forms and instructions every year—at the cost of about 300,000 trees! All this effort translates to about 5.4 billion hours spent every year by Americans just complying with the tax rules. From 1913 to 2005, the income tax has enabled, entitled, empowered, and engorged the federal government, states, and local governments, pri- vate enterprises, and millions of private citizens.

What’s more, the income tax could be used as both an economic tool and as a political weapon. Tax rates could be manipulated, for exam- ple, to punish or reward favored political gro ups. When the Constitution was ratif ied in 1789, the colonists in the New Wo rld believed they had won for themselves a measure of fr eedom and in- dependen ce. “A republic, if you can keep it,” Benjamin Franklin warned. But by the end of 1913, a scant 124 years later, Americans were happy to lose their republic; an empire was what they wanted. AMERICAN CAESARS But the income tax was only the beginning. If one of the def ining features of empire is an open-ended source of funding, another is the shift of power away from the legislature in favor of the central executive. In 1913, a sec- ond amendment tipped th e scales of authority toward Washington in a way hardly conceived of in the deb ates of the late eight eenth century. When the Founding Fathers set down the rules for how senators were to be elected, they anticipated a balance between states’ rights and the central government. In its original form, the Constitution reads: The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each state, elected by the people the reof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote. The ele ctors in each state shall have the qualif ications requis ite for ele ctors of the most numerous branch of the state legislatures. Wh en vacancies happen in the representation of any st ate in the Senate, the executive authority of such state shall issue writs of election to f ill such vacancies. . . . Th e foundin g fathers saw the indirect election of se nators as a means for keeping a balance of power, enabling the states to exert control over the federal legislative branch. The Senate was perceived originally as serv- ing two roles: Ke eping one eye on states’ rights and interests, and the other wary eye on the executive branch, the federal courts, and the House of Repre- sent atives. It was contemplated that members of this body would be"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"136 WOODROW CROSSES THE RUBICON olde r, wiser, mo re experienced, and better qualif ied than members of the House and members of state legislatures. Appointed Senators were expected to be somewhat isolated from knee-jerk reactions to current pub lic debates. They would answer for their political acts to state legis- latures, and only indirectly to public mobs and voters. 9 “T he preservation of the states in a certain degree of agency is indis- pensable,” stated John Dickinson, the Delaware delegate at the 1787 Con- stitutionalC onvention, “It will produce the collision between the different authorities that should be wished for in order to check each other.” 10 James Madison, primary architect of the U.S. Cons titution, noted that indirect elections would serve as “a defense to the people against their own temporary errors and delusions [and would] blend stability with liberty.” 11 Each state—acting through its own legislature—should have the right to direct its senators how to vote on issues and how to best repre sent the state’s interests. But along came the great humbug, William Jennings Bryan (again). He maintained the Senate was controlled by corrupt state legislatures. Bryan, who tried to win the presidency three times (in 1896, 1900, and 1908), was described by C. H. Hoebeke, Fellow in Constitu- tional History at the Center for Constitutional Studies: Secretary Bryan put his seal upon the reform th at, in the expectations of those who had labored for it, would end the dominance of party “bosses” and the state “machines,” stamp out the undue inf luence of special interests in the Senate, make it more responsive to the will of the people, and of course, eliminate, or greatly reduce, the execrable practice of spending large sums of money to get elected. 12 Th eS eventeenth Amendment “improved” the original way that sena- tors we re picked by making the election system more democratic.

Since 1913, the pro- cess has been completely reversed. The federal government now collects most of the money from the income tax, and then doles out the revenue to the individual states, usually with many provisos, dictates, and com- ma nds attached. This allows the central government to exert great inf lu- ence over state funding and in many areas not mentioned in the Co nstitution: highway speed limits, education, health care, medical mat- ters, ownership of weapons, food and drug oversight, police and law en- forcement, libraries, the environment, business practices—the list is long and dreary. And now with Homeland Security and the Patriot Act, the list is getting longer. NEW MONEY A central bank, as the name implies, is intended as a national center for the control of currency in circulation. It referees the exchange of funds between states and their own banks, and manages debt, both domestically between banks, and internationally between the host country and other governments. The republic, in the years leading up to 1913, had an un- easy relationship, at best, with the notion of a central bank. Alexander Hamilton, f irst treasury secr etary of the new nation, strug- gled with high debts from the Revolutionary War. He proposed a central bank to manage the war debt and to create a single currency. In 1791, Co ngress drafted a charter for the First Bank of the United States. But by 1811, the national emergency had subsided; Congress dec ided the b ank no longer served any purpose, so it was closed. As a consequence of closing the central bank, state banks f lourished. They issued bank notes and the widespread debt-based exchange system went far beyond banking itself. The system grew like zucchini. Every location large enough to have “a church, a tavern, or a blacksmith shop was deemed a suitable place for setting up a bank,” said John Kenneth Galbraith. 13 These banks issued notes, and even barbers and bartenders competed with banks in this respect. But the delightful free-for-all banking situation couldn’t last forever. Predictably, the War of 1812 ended with a large war debt and inf lation ros e to about 14 percent per year. President James Madison signed a new"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"138 WOODROW CROSSES THE RUBICON bill in 1816 creating the Second Bank of the United States—with the pur- pose of again managing debt caused by war. By the end of the 1820s, a conf lict had grown between the bank and President Andrew Jackson, who saw the system as a threat to the virtues of the re public. Jackson argued that the bank should be disbanded. Jackson pre- vailed ,and theb ank’s charter was vetoed in 1832, with the Second Bank of theU nited States closing in 1836. The period that followed—1837 through 1862—is known as the era of “wildcat” banks; only state-chartered banks operated, limited to activities mandated by each state’s laws. The legal footing for the creation of currency is limited in the Con- stitution. Article 1, Section 8 permits Congress to coin money and regu- late its value, and Section 10 denies the states the same right. But because any agreed-on medium serves the purpose that we associate with money (an exchange of value) there is no absolute ban on state banks issuing notes. Nor is there any reason a private individual cannot issue his own IOUs, for that matter. At theb eginning of the wildcat bank era, the Supreme Court ruled that state banks had the right to issue notes as media of exchange. When Michigan became a state in 1837, it allowed a bank to gain a charter if it me tspecif ic criteria, without also requiring permission from the state leg- islature. Banks came and went like nail salons. A study of 709 banks in four states found that between 1838 and 1863, half of the banks failed, and a thi rd we re not able to honor redemption of notes for gold or silver specie. Overall in the period, banks remained open only f ive years on average. Wi del yc irculated bank notes—often not backed by reserves—replaced the national currency. States struggled with widespread counterfeiting, in- flated note valuation, and the natural instability of the free market. Bu tthe Wa r between the States brought the wildcat banking era to a cra shing halt. The f irst National Banking Act of 1863 brought control over banking to the federal government once again. In addition to creat- ing a uniform national banking system and a single national currency, the newl aw also providedas econdar y mar kettothe U.S. Treasury to f inance theg rowing debts of the Civil War. The change was gradual. By 1870, there were 1,638 national banks versus only 325 state banks. However, state banks continued to operate, having replaced the bank note system withan ew conc ept: the checking account. By 1890, only about 10 per- cent of the U.S. money supply was repre sented by currency.

Morgan saved several New York banks by granting pers onal loans. By 1910, Wall Street executives and Washington politicians saw an op- portunity. They met at Jekyll Island off the coast of Georgia, in seclusion and secrecy, to discuss formation of a centralized mon etary agency. Se nator Ne lson Aldrich met with executives of what is today known as Citibank; Mo rgan Bank; and Kuhn, Loeb Investment House. The so-called Aldrich Plan recommended the formation of 15 regional banks controlled by a na- tional board. The banks would be allowed to make emergency loans to me mbers and create a f lexible currency, serving as the mon etary arm of the federal government. Although the original plan was defeated in the House, the form ula mo deled what is now known as the Federal Reserve S ystem. The legislation, variously called the Currency Bill and the Owen- Glass Act, emerged as the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. It created a dozen regional Re serve Banks to be coordinated by a chairman who would be appointed by the presi den t. While the Constitution grants Congress the right to print money, under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, Congress approved a plan to delegate this right to the Fed, which is not part of Co ngress. The U.S. dollar is not issued by the U.S. Treasury but by a pri- vately owned organization, which also inf luences bank interest rates, the amount of currency in circulation, and even the levels of inf lation in the United States. After months of testi mony, deb ate, and over 3,000 pages of documentation of the hear ings, the bill was passed and, on December 23, 1913, ratif ied and signed. For the f irst time, privately issued debt instru- ment s (currency) would be issued by a private institution but guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States. This last innovation—the establishment of the Federal Reserve Sys- tem—plays a special role in shaping America’s unique system of imperial f inance, as we will see later.

In the Old Republic, government was a referee between individuals and between states. Laws were rules of order that were inten ded to be relatively neutral. Relatively few laws were passed be- cause most of what happened was thought to be out of the range of the rule makers. But this idea of government changed radically in the 1930s. The gov- ernment would no longer be accurately described as functioning solely as a law-making and law-enforcing body. This new government would make thi ngs better! It is rarely talked about these days, but a tthetimetheNewDealpro- grams were being passed into law, most people believed they were intended to be temporary measures. At the very least, these programs were never though ttob ethe cornerstones of a long-term change in the homeland. In 1935, when the Social Security Act was passed, the promise was that every American would have a secure, if minimal, retirement (if he or she beat the averages and outlived the retirement age of 65). The govern- ment, once and for all, would eliminate the common ailments related to old age—sickness, hom elessness, disability, and poverty. This was a radical departure from American tradition. The New Deal created a permanent, paternal central government that has only grown more paternal and more centralized in the years since. Franklin Roosevelt’s plan for Social Security was a massive r ethinking of the state, in the sense that the new system was much more than a simple safety net. It bound ordinary citizens to the federal govern-ment in a way that had not been imagined by the Founding Fathers. People came to rely on the state for their daily bread, and to take a much keener interest in the state itself. Traditional virtues—thrift, independence, self- reliance—were replaced with new virtues: political activism and gaming the system. In the second Roosevelt era, people came to expect the state to take care of things at home; later, they would come to expect the Ameri- can government to build a better world outside the homeland, too. While campaigning for pr esidency, Roo sevelt had denounced Hoover as a spendthrift. The democratic platform during the campaign of 1932 called for, among other things, a drast ic reduction of government spend- ing by at least 25 percent, abolishing u seless commissions and off ices, a budget balanced annually, and a sound currency to be preserved at all haz- ards. But the country was in the throes of the Great Depression."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"The Revolution of 1913 and the Great Depression 141 Th e causes of the depression have been hotly debated. They go be- yond the scope of this book. But the consequences of the economic setback we re to spur the nation toward its imperial mission. After the crash of the stock market in 1929, and after the country had entered a def lationary depression in the 1930s, there was little that a man sitting in a chair at 16 Penn sylv ania Avenue could do to avert the aftermath of the debt bubble. “Every bo dy tells me what is the matter, but nobody tells me what to do,” Roo sevelt complained to his cabinet at one point early in his presidency. Soo n Washington was f looded with do-gooders chomping at the bit to tell the president what to do. New books published as early as 1932 led the way. George Soule of The New Republic penned th e inf luential tract “A Planned Society.” Stuart Chase penned another called “A New Deal.” Be- fore long, Roosevelt was awash in new ideas. With the new tools from 1913 in his hands, Roosevelt had the ability to turn screws and tighten valu es throughout the economy. How could he resist? Among the ideas adopted was one pushed forward by a California physi- cian named Francis Townsend in 1933. The Townsend Plan was designed to extinguish poverty forever. When it f irst hit the presses, Roosevelt was oppo sed. But its popularity caught on; two years later under pressure from the voters, Roosevelt introduced the Social Security Act. The organizers of the Townsend Plan became major critics of the government program, com- plaining that it did not provide enough assistance. Follow ing the establishment of the act’s primary benef it, the old age insurance provision, Congress amended the law four years later to add sur- vivors’ insurance. Medicare benef its were added in 1965. By 2005, Social Security and Medicare took up 27 percent of the federal budget. While the progr am was relatively young, it was a novel idea and controversy sur- rounded the question of whether the program paid out enough based on the required payroll deductions people paid in. Little concern was given to wh eth er it could remain solvent in the long term. Other programs introduced as part of the original act inc luded the Fede ral Un emp loym ent Insurance Act ( FUTA), funded by a tax on em- ploye rs’ side of payroll; and Aid to Dependent Children (ADC), now called Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC).

These seven were to feed the"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"The Revolution of 1913 and the Great Depression 143 hungry, give drink to the thirsty, wel come the stranger, clothe the naked, visit the sick, visit the prisoner, and bury the dead. What is new is the idea that the state should serve as the primary caregiver. The Elizab ethan Poor Laws were based on the premise that the family wa sprima rily responsible for providing help to anyone in need, especially within their own families. Elderly parents were to be cared for by younger family members. Beyond that, the churches were responsible for providing relief. In fact, the community parish was the basic unit of re- sponsibility under the Elizabethan Poor Law system. By 1601, inconsis- tenciesint he administration of relief, the growing problem of burglars and robbers—the “sturdy beggars” of the times—and the diff iculty of dealing with those who took advantage of the system led to a consolida- tion of thes ep oor laws. The T enth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution declared, “The pow- ersnot delegated to the U nited States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.” 14 While broad, the intent of this amendment is clear: The federal government of the old republic had never been intended to watch over the welfare of its citizens. Yet, the feds now administer more welfare programs than we can imagine. Remembering their names is like learning the logarithmic tables by heart—just as diff icult and even more pointless. State programs, while they exist, are often only supplementary. In many instances, funding of state programs is derived fro mhando uts determined and administered by the f ederal government, invariabl ywithstringsattached. The robust mob of organizations, designed to provide jobs, training, and more, is mind-boggling. These groups inc luded the Civil Wo rks Ad ministration, the Civilian Conservation Corps, the National Youth Ad ministration, and the Works Progress Administration—all agencies of the federal government, al l intended to provide services that “are re- served to the states respectively” as identif ied in the Tenth Amendment.

It also threw out one of the most signif icant pieces of the New Deal, the National Industrial Re covery Act of 1933. In 1936, the trend continued when the Court de- clared the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 unconstitutional. The Supreme Court was intended to have the last word for the judi- ciary branch. It was expected to be made up of wise old men, like a council of elders in more primitive societi es. At the time, six of the nine judges were over 70. They were not dead, but they were old enough to know better than to go along with the presi dent’s ambitious new pro- grams. Early in 1937, Roosevelt spoke with his advisors about a new draft bill that called for Supreme Court justices to retire at the age of 70. Un der the proposed new rule, if they did not retire, the president would be able to appoint a new ju dge, increasing the number of justices on the Court to 15. Roo sevelt appealed dire ctly to the masses during a Fireside Chat in March 1937. He explained his proposed new legislation and def ined both the new imperial executive and its contempt for the wisdom of old age: The American people have learned from the depression. For in the last three national elections an overwhelming majority of them have voted a mandate that the Congress and the presi dent begin the t ask of provid- ing...protection [aka. Something for nothin g]—not after long years of debate, but now. The courts, however, have cast doubts on the abil- ity of the elected Congress to protect us against catastrophe by meeting squarely our modern social and economic conditions. . . . [S]ince the rise of the modern movement for social and economic progress through legislat ion, the court has more and more often and more and more boldly asserted a power to veto laws passed by the Congress and by state legislatures. ...The court in a ddition to the proper use of its judicial functions has improperly set itself up as a third house of the Congress— a super-legislature, as one of the justices has called it—reading into the Consti tution words an d implications which are not there, and which were nev er intended to be there. What is my proposal? It is simply this: Whenever a judge or justice of any federal court has reached the age of 70 and does not avail himself of the opportunity to retire on a pension, a new member shall be ap point ed by the president then in off ice, with the approval, as required by the Co nstitution, of the Senate of the United States. 15"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"146 WOODROW CROSSES THE RUBICON While retirement would not be mandatory as soon as a judge turned 70, the out come of this proposal is apparent. As soon as a ju dge did reach that age, the presi dent would cert ainly a ppoint a new member. The U nited States would have ended up with a younger, more obliging Court with a perm anent membership of 15. Those bringing appeals forward to the Court wou ld time their f ilings based on current age, time to age 70, and the pres- ident then in off ice. Even Roosevelt admitted this in a veiled thr eat to the Co urt, in the same address. He said “The number of judges to be a ppointed wou ld depend wholly on the decision of present ju dges now over 70, or those who would subsequently reach the age of 70.” 16 Co ngress balked. After months of hearings on the bill, the Senate killed FDR’s plan with a 70 to 20 vote. The proposal was sent back to commit tee and nothing came of it. But the winds of empire continued to blow ha rd. Economists, philosophers, radicals, and other malcontents rolled into Washington like tumblew eeds, with plans for centrali zed control of the economy. When Roo sevelt entered off ice, having chided the Republicans be- fore him for spendin g too muc h money, the federal de bt, after 143 years, had grown to $19 billion. Roosevelt—in just four years—borrowed al- most as much mon ey as all the dead presidents who came before h im. He and members of Congress at the time were disturbed about it, but ideas arise as they are needed. The big spenders needed an idea that would per- mit huge new levels of government debt. They soon found it: A govern- ment, unlike an individual, can borrow and spend indefinitely without fear of bankruptcy. A government borrows money from its citizens. Therefore, it owes that debt to its citizens. The debt is therefore owed by the people to themselves. And no matter how large the debt gets, the f i- nancial impact on the citizens and the government is negligible. On the subject of what would happen if that debt were owed to foreign bond holders, the Roosevelt era empire builders were l ess clear. “T he apostle of this sly philosophy was Dr. Alvin Hansen of Har- vard,” writes John T. Flynn, “When this small book, written by Dr. Hansen’s disciples, appeared, the doctor was promptly brought to Wash- ingto n and installed in the Federal Reserve Board as the economic philo sopher of this new dispensation. . . . Now Roosevelt had a luminous guide through the chaos,” observed Flynn, “The American economic sys- tem planned and directed from Washington and an endless f low of funds to spend, supplied by endless borrowing.” 17"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"The Revolution of 1913 and the Great Depression 147 TEN THOUSAND COMMANDMENTS The Social Security system was considered to be a great improvement of the Ro osevelt era. It was supposed to provide a cushion of cash for re- tired people—so they wouldn’t have to eat dog food in their old age. But never was a shiny bell cast by world improvers without a big crack in it somewhere. Economist Martin Feldstein pointed out that if you could count on receiving payments from Social Security, you had less need to save. Fewer savings meant less mon ey for the economy to invest in new industries. Less mon ey invested meant lower productivity and wages. If the government had funded its Social Security system honestly, the miss- ing private savings would have been replaced by public savings in the “Social Security Trust Fund.” Instead, the system was unfunded. There we re never any savings in the fund—just liabilities from other parts of the federal government. Soc ial Se curity reduced the availability of capi- tal and indirectly reduced capital investment. Like other taxes, Social Se- curity made people poorer—by reducing the rate of economic growth. There was also unemp loyment compensation to blame. When people could expect money even if they didn’t work, many would choose to be unemployed, creating an obvious drag on the prod uctive economy. All the hundreds of thou sands of pettifogging rules, laws, and regulations acted on the economy like Velcro on a fuzz ball. By the early twenty-f irst century the total cost of federal regulation of the economy was all but impossible to calculate. In an annual report called “T en Thousand Commandments” published by both the Cato Institute and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the author, Clyde Wayne Crews Jr., makes some astounding guesses: “The exact cost of federal regulations can never be known. Federal environmental, safety, health and economic regulations cost hundreds of billions of dollars every year—on top of off i- cial federal outlays.” The report continued: •T he 2004 Federal Register contained 75,676 pages, a 6.2 percent increase from 2003’s 71,269 pages. This is an all-time record. • In 2004, 4,101 f inal rules were issued by agencies. This is a slight 1 percent decline from 2003. •W hereas regulatory agencies issued 4,101 f inal rules, Congress passed and the President signed into law a comparatively low 299 bills in 2004."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"148 WOODROW CROSSES THE RUBICON • In the 2004 Unified Agenda, agencies reported on 4,083 regula- tions that were at various stages of implementation throughout the 50-plus federal departments, agencies, and commissions, a 4 per- cent drop from the previous year’s 4,266. • Of the 4,266 regulations now in the regulatory pipeline, 135 are “economically signif icant” rules that will have at least $100 million in economic impact. Those rules will impose at least $13.5 billion year ly in future off-budget costs. Boss ing people around like this costs a lot of money. How much? • Based on a broadly constructed compilation of annual regulatory costs by economists Thomas Hopkins and Mark Crain, regulatory costs hit an estimated $877 billion in 2004, an amount equiva lent to 38 percent of all FY 2004 outlays. •R egulatory costs are more than twice the $412 billion budget def icit. •R egulatory costs of $877 billion are equiva lent to 7.6 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, estimated at $10,980 billion for 2003. •F ede ral regulatory costs of $877 billion combined with outlays of $2,292 billion bring the federal government’s share of the economy to some 27 percent. •R egulatory costs also exceed all corporate pretax prof its, which we re $745 billion in 2002. •R egulatory costs exceed estimated 2004 individual income taxes of $765 billion, and are far greater than corporate income taxes of $169 billion.

Wr iter Graham Greene visited the French just before the shooting started. He found them well supplied—with 48,000 bottles of wine. The French had a number of advantages similar to the advantages Americans would bring to bear in Vietnam 10 years later. They controlled the air. Using airpower, they brought in 15,000 soldiers and provisions to a remote airf ield west of Hanoi. The idea was to install themselves there, disrupt General Giap’s supplies, block his move into Laos, and bring him to a pitched battle in which superior French f irepower would be decisive. “A defeat can be borne from a victory,” began the Figaro’s 50-year loo k back on May 7, 2004. “In order to understand Dien Bien Phu, you have to remember Na-San. This battle, won by the French Army, explains the other...and brought the whole thing to dis aster. Eighteen months separated them. General Giap, commander of the Vietminh forces, used these 18 months to learn from his defeat. The French high commander, on th e other hand, became more sure of himself than ever.” 2 At Na -San, the French established a base on a plateau. Giap attacked. The French were able to hold their ground while the Vietminh staggered away. In a single night, Giap lost 3,000 men. If the French were going to destroy themselves in Southeast Asia, they had to f ind a better way. They found it at Dien Bien Phu. The broad outlines of the battle were as fol- lows: French parachutists took control of the airf ield followed by 15,000 troops under Colonel Christian de Castries. The French dug trenches and set up bases, to which they gave women’s names. Dien Bien Phu was not on a plateau, but in a depression, surrounded by hills covered in jungle. If the Vietminh brought up heavy artillery, the French goose would be cooked. But neither de Castries nor the French high command thought Giap could do it. The surprise began on March 13, 1954. Giap’s artillery threw off its camouf lage and opened f i re in the afternoon. A shell hit the French every six seconds, off and on, for the next 56 days. Then, Giap sent in waves of infantry. Camp “Gabrielle” was taken by the Vietminh and then reta ken by the Legionnaires, before being abandoned to the enemy. “B eatrice” was lost after its commander was killed. “Anne-Marie” went down next.

The only way to get supplies was to drop them from the sky; often they fell into the hands of the enemy. The French were cut off and doomed. Still, they held out hoping a diplomatic solution could be found. It did not come. The weather turned against the French, says the Figaro. They fought in a blast furnace. Then came the rains and they were up to their knees in mu d. Doctors operated standing up in it. On May 6, Giap ordered a gen- eral assault. “Dominique” and “Eliane” were quickly overrun. On May 7, the order was given to blow up the munitions. Colonel Piroth committed suicide. By 5:30 PM ,a ceas e-f ire was sounded, though “Isabelle” held out until 1:00 AM the following day. After the 56-day siege, French General de Castries radioed his supe- rior in Hanoi, sounding Napoleonic: “I’m blowing up the installations. The ammunition dumps are already exploding. Au revoir.” “Well th en,” came the reply, “au revoir, mon vieux.” 3 Thousands of French were captured. From t he evi dence, the Vietminh we re not particularly mean to them, but indifferent. The victors had little to eat themselves, and hardly any medicine. The French, many of them woun ded, died quickly. They were forced to march 500 to 600 kilometers; ma ny didn’t make it. Only about 3,900 of them ever returned to France. Still, the French should cheer. It was a small price to pay to “put an end to illusions,” as the Figaro described it a half-century later. 4 General Giap should have been so lucky. Like many coloni es, Vietnam had f lourished under French admini stration. There were bars, brothels, and sidewalk ca fés in Hanoi. There were elegant hotels and well-dressed wo me n, dignif ied beach houses near the ocean, and splendid plantation hom es in the hills. People could do pretty much as they pleased.

Time after time, the history of world i mprovement yields the same lesson: Leave well enough alone. And time after time, the world improvers ignore it; they always know be tter. But we are getting ahead of our story. When Ho came of age, the gabby talk of independence was running through Europe’s colonial posses- sions like an epidemic of Bird Flu. Locals who had been exposed to a lit- tle education were quickly infected and often succumbed. Ho Chi Minh was one of many thousands who got the bug. He had gone to Europe, where he heard Woodrow Wilson’s airy song of freedom. It was just after Wo rld War I had ended. Paris had a habit of turning a young man’s head. Ho’s head swiv eled around just like ever yone els e’s. Soon, he had joined not only the Annamite Patriots league, but also the communist party. Of all the world improvers of the time, the Bolsheviks had the biggest im- provements in mind. Near the close of the war, against all odds, they took over the world’s biggest country and were improving it mercilessly. The rest of the improvers looked on in admiration, and turned to Moscow for guidance and money. Ho was no exception. Ho Chi Minh trav eled widely, partly to see how the r est of the world worked, and partly to make contacts that would be useful in his campaign to liberate Indochina from the French. One trip took him to New York and Boston, where he claimed he worked as a cook’s helper in the Parker Ho use Hotel in Boston. He also said he once took a trip to the South, wh ere he witnessed the lynching of blacks by the Ku Klux Klan. (Sounds improbable; the Klan did not exactly lynch someone everyday. It is also hard to imagine a young man fresh off the boat from Vietnam standing around to watch the Klan at work; we imagine Ho would have felt like a lamb attending a wolves’ picnic.)

In this passage from Ho Chi Minh’s biography, wherein he refers to himself as “Ba,” we see how close the wo rld came to having another decent pastry chef instead of another inde- cent world improver: Each of us had to take turns in the clearing up. The waiters, after at- tending the customer, had to clear all the plates and send them by mean s of an electric lift to the kitchen. Then our job was to separate china and silver for cleaning. When it came to Ba’s turn he was very careful. Instead of throwing out all the bits left over, which were often a quarter of a chicken or a huge piece of steak, and so on, Ba kept them clean and sent them back to the kitchen. Noticing this, Chef Escoff ier asked Ba: “Why didn’t you throw these remains into the rubbish as the others do? ” “These things shou ldn’t be thrown away .Youcouldgivethemtothepoor.” “My dear young friend, listen to me!” Chef Escoff ier seemed to be pleased and said, smiling: “Leave your revolutionary ideas aside for a moment, and I will teach you the art of cooking, which will bring you a lot of money. Do you agree?” And Chef Escoff ier did not leave Ba at the job of washing dishes but took him to the cake section, where he got higher wages. It was in deed a great event in the kitchen for it was the f irst time the “kitchen king” had done that sort of thing. 6 Alas, the smell of good works must have been more alluring then the pain au chocolat. The world lost a good pastry chef and gained a bad ac- tivist. Instead of bringing pleasure to a few hundred, or maybe a thousand, customers, the Annamite Wilson dec ided in stead to launch himself into politics and begin a campaign that would bring misery and death to mil- lion s. In London, he warmed up with street demonstrations in favor of Irish independence and a variety of progressive causes. When he read Marx and other revolutionary penseu rs, his head was turn ed so far his neck almost broke. Here were people with a grand theory of how the en- tire world could be improved. And here were people ready to help a skin ny, poor young man take over a country. Ho Chi Minh returned to Indochina, organized the Vietminh and began the long campaign for independence.

Before he was f inished, he would have to bury nearly as many people as Alexander or Po l Pot. Ho Chi Minh’s brief visit to the United States had left him som ewhat naïve and puzzled about America. Ho had not kept up with Wilsonian im- provements in the land of the free. When he addressed the crowd in Ba Dinh Square following the August Revolution of 1945, he spoke not of America as it was, but perhaps as it should have been. It was the America that existed before Wilson improved it. It was the America that minded its own business and had not yet taken the road to empire. “A ll me n are created equal,” said Ho. “They are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights; among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” This statement appeared in the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America in 1776. In a broader sense, it means: All the peoples on the earth are equal from birth, all the peoples have a right to live and to be happy and free. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and the citizen, made at the time of the French Revolution, in 1791, also states: “All men are born free and with equal rights, and must always remain free and have equal rights.” In this short speech, Ho extended a hand to two nations. One already had not just one empire, but several of them. It had been home to the Em- pire of the Franks, and then the Holy Roman Empire. Bonaparte made his own empire and his nephew revived it, brief ly. The other nation, the United States of America, had been a mod est republic only a few years be- for e, but now had imperial responsibilities all over the globe. Ho didn’t know it, but if he wanted to rule Indochina he would have to kick both their de rrie res. The August Revolution had been swift and relatively bloodless. On Au gust 14, the Japanese surrendered. All of a sudden, there was an empty hol e where an imperial power used to sit. The Japanese were laying down their guns. In Vietnam, they wanted to surrender, but didn’t know to whom. French administrators were still in the prisons where the Japanese had put them. So were other allied troops.

On the morning of August 25, 1945, his “defense units” swiftly seized government installations and enterprises all over Vietnam. Within hours, the country was under Vietminh control. Vo Nguyen Giap described the joyful scene in Ba Dinh Square, formerly known as Place Puginier: Han oi was bedecked with red bunting. A world of f lags, lanterns and flowe rs. Flutter ing red f lags adorned the roofs, the trees and the lakes. Streamers were hung across streets and roads, bearing slogans in Viet- namese, French, English Chinese and Russian: “Viet Nam for the Vietnamese.” “Down with French colon iali sm,” “Independence or death,” “Support the provisional government,” “Support Presi dent Ho Chi Minh,” “Welcome to the Allied mission,” and so on. Factories and shops, big and small, were closed down. Markets were deserted ...the whole city, old and young, men and women, took to the streets. ...Multicolored str eams of people f lowed to Ba Dinh Square from all directions. Wo rkers in white shirts and blue trousers came in ranks, full of strength and con fiden ce....Hundreds of thousands of peasants came from the city suburbs. People’s militiamen carried quarter-staffs, swords or scimitars. Some even carried old-style bronze clubs and long-handles [sic] swords taken from the armories of temples. Among the women peasants in their festive dresses, some were clad in old-fashioned robes, yellow turbans and bright-green sashes . . . Most lively were the children. ...They marched in step with the whistle blows of their leaders, singing revolutionary songs. 7 At that very moment, about 15,000 French people living in Hanoi, and five t housand French prisoners still bein g h eld in Japanese internment camps, along with an y number of Vietnamese nationalists, were all preparing to contest Ho’s authority. But naïve Ho called on his people to treat foreigners with tolerance and respect and looked to the United States for support. Sure ly the country that made wars of independence popular would back him up. Ho wrote several letters to the Truman administration asking for help.

Winston Churchill, repre sent- ing a declining empire, stood before a crowd in Fulton, Missouri, and said an “iron curtain” had come down separating one empire from another. There was now a “communist bloc” that threatened the “free world.” Co mmunism must be “contained,” or it would take over the entire world. A new war had begun—the “Cold War.” Ty pically, the empire builders see the globe in simple-minded terms. It is the only way they can understand it; the only way they can justify their own vain and preposterous interventions. There was no iron curtain in Vietnam, just the same diaphanous fabric that was draped over the rest of the world. Ho Chi Minh explained it to an American off icial, Archimedes Patti, on September 30, 1945. At the close of the conversation, Ho recoun ted t ohisv isitor some of the key ev ents in his life a sarevolutionary.ConcedingthatmanyAmer- icans viewed him as a “Moscow puppet,” Ho denied that he was a Com- munist in the American sense.

Why should it be inde bted t oM oscow? As they parted, Ho Chi Minh asked his visitor to carry back a message that the Vietnamese people would al ways be grate ful for the assistance they received from the United States and would long recall it as a friend and ally, and that the American struggle for independence would always serve as an example for Vietnam. A few weeks later, another departing U.S. military off icer carried a letter from Ho Chi Minh to Presi dent Tru- man. But the likelihood of any U.S. assistance was rapidly dimming. Patti’s activities had strengthened suspicions among U.S. off icials in both China and the United States, and when his successor cabled Washington that Hanoi would welcome a U.S. effort to mediate the dispute, both Hanoi’s offer and Ho’s previous letters were ignored. Americans were once again in no mood for modest restraint, ambigu- ity, or question marks. Senator Joseph McCarthy was readying his inqui- sitio n.

In a matter of weeks, the French we re on the loose and rebuilding their bas es. There was an awkward pe- riod—a mo dus vivendi was worked out with the French.

B ut there was no peace. The French we re bec om ing more and more insistent. They drove around in U.S.- made jeeps and carried U.S.-made arms. Ho began to wonder whose side the Americans were on. Again, as in World War I, the United States seemed to pick its ally without much real thought. In Indochina, for the next quarter of a century, the worl d improvers would run into each othe r. Ho wanted to liberate the Annamites from the yoke of colonial rule. Other Viet- namese—Catholics, Buddhists, capi talists, traditional nationalists—wanted to liberate them from Ho. The Fren ch, meanwhile, didn’t want to liber- ate them at all—but force them to be good subjects of France’s recon- structe d empire in the Far E ast. And America, what did America want? America didn’t know exactly what she wanted. But she def initely wanted to t hrow her weight around. Ho was duly elected in January 1946. As presi dent of the country, it was not at all clear that he had to run in a district election, but he chose to do so, and won 98.4 percent of the vote. The French were about to nullify the vote and reimpose colonial rule. A moment’s thought would suggest that the Americans would side with Ho, or at least stay out of it. But if America could back the world’s two largest colonial empires in Wo rld War I—and do so in the name of democracy—there was no effec- tive limit to the hypocrisy of her foreign policy. Besides, once again, she loo ked up at those big, gaudy bubbles, those empty, f loating words, and she was in a trance. Th is time they did not say anything about democracy. The mo od had changed. This time the bubbles said “red menace.” The f irst Indochina war began on December 19, 1946, when the Vi- etminh blew up the municipal power station in Hanoi.

Its wars again st the Mexicans and Spaniards were more sor- did than glorious. Even its Revolutionary War was merely a minor engagement compared with the Napoleonic Wars, and only won because the French intervened at a crucial moment to pull Americans’ chestnuts out of the f ire. Here, we quote Charles W. Eliot’s history, in which he describes how the patriots had fallen “into a condition of despondency from wh ich nothi ng but the steadfastness of Washington and the Conti- nental army and th e aid from France saved them.” 8 In World War I, the French battered themselves against the Germans for two years—and suffered more casualties than America had in all its wa rs put together—before Pershing ever set foot in France. Again, in Wo rld War II, Americans waited until the combatants had been softened up before entering the war with an extraordinary advantage in fresh sol- diers and almost unlimited supplies. Am ericans have no history. Probably just as well. The French, on the other hand, have too much. Practical ly every street in Paris reminds them of a slaughter somewhere. On the Arc de Triomphe, Les Invalides, and doz ens of other piles of stone, the names of towns in Germany, Spain, Italy, Poland, Russia, or North Africa are inscribed. Each one marks the deaths of thousands of French sold ier s—gone early to their graves for who-remembers-what important nationa l purpose. Every town in France, even the most remote and forlorn little burg, has at its center a pillar of granite or marble—with the names of the men whose bodies were torn to bits by f lying lead or corroded by some battlef ield disease. A whole race of orphans grew up after World War I and special seats on the subway were designated for those “mutilated in war” including thousands of sans gueules —men who had had their jaws blown away and yet survived, too horrible to look on. The French have had enough of war—at least for now. Let them enjoy a well-earned cowardice.

The No rthV ietnamese never posed any real danger to the United States, so there wa sn ever much danger in bombing them—unless China or Russia got spooked and f i red nuclear warheads toward North America. There was no way Ho and his men were ever going to seize Washington and put U.S. leaders in the dock for war crimes.

Wilso n, too, felt abandoned and betrayed—f irst because Democrats wa nted nothi ng to do with the brain-damaged presi dent in the election of 1920 and second, because in rejecting his League of Nations, Congress seemed to repudiate him and all he stood for. “I beseech you in the bowels of Christ to consider that you may be wron g.” 9 Oliver Cromwell’s warning has no effect on real empire builders; you might a swellcautionsa ilors against getting drunk on shore leave.

He had been a junior off icer in World Wa r I I d o i n g statistical analysis. Then, he had gone to work for the Ford Mo tor Company as an executive. Had he even read Sun Tzu or Clause- witz or Machiavelli, or Caesar or Bonaparte? Had he tried to learn a sin- gle thing from the millions of dead soldiers, the thousands of battles, the hundreds of wars? If so, he doesn’t mention it. “I entered the Pentagon with a limited grasp of military affairs and even less grasp of covert operations,” he says. 10 What about Vietnam? He knew nothing, zero, about the place. But then, as he points out, neither did Kennedy or National Security Advisor Mc George Bundy, or military advisor General Maxwell Ta ylor. The only peop le in the Western world who knew an ything about Viet nam were the French. And the American team dec ided to ignore the French; they were losers. By this time, the French were becoming cynical of military affairs. Every war they had been involved in since the time of Napoleon had gone bad , even those they won. By contrast, every war America had fought—at least since the War between the States—had been a reasonable succ ess. Americans were still bright eyed, full of energy, ambition, and “can do” spirit. Robert MacNamara was one of the “brightest and best” of the lot—the kind of American who makes you proud to be one. He was a problem solver, a doer, a take-charge guy, the youngest Secr etary of De- fense ever, badly in need of some Gallic cynicism.

As far as the American republic was conc erned, it was of no interest whatever. But in the new empire, any change of allegiance set off alar ms. Mac- Namara, Kennedy, Johnson—all the guardi ans of Wilsonian foreign pol- icy—heard the tinkle and rushed to take action. They hardly noticed that none had the blurriest notion of what they were really up to. “I am con- vinced that it would be disastrous for the United States and the Free World to permit Southeast Asia to be overrun by the Communist North,” said Dean Rusk. Why? Had a nyone gone to talk to Uncle Ho? Did anyone know if his plans were compatible with U.S. interests? It did not seem to ma tter to them. Nor did it matter that the actions they were taking were contradi ctory to even their own stated aims. “Some others are eager to enlarge the conf lict,” said Presi dent John- son in 1964. “They call upon us to supply American boys to do the job that Asian boys shou ld do....Such action would of fer no solution at all to the real problem of Vietnam. ...The South Vietnamese have the basic responsibility for the defense of their own freedom.” 12 Thus, did the presi dent repeat what President Kennedy had said before him, and what every American felt in his heart: If the South Vietnamese wa nted independence, they could f ight for it just as we had. There was a practical consideration behind the sentiment. If the South Vietnamese could not organize or motivate their own people to protect themselves, it would be impossible for foreigners to do the job for them. No one likes to admit that he is going to war for reasons of vanity or pride. That kind of ambition is, like a bad facelift, not a pretty sight. Or- dinary citizens usually turn away from it; they don’t like the idea of get- ting their sons killed and their wallets stolen to support a brassy campaign of self-aggrandizement. So, real ambitions are usually hidden so well that not even the leaders themselves can see their own vanity in them. In 1965, Presidential Military Advisor, General Maxwell Ta ylor explained: “The situation in Vietnam is deteriorating and without new U.S. action defeat appe ars inevitable ...the stakes in Viet nam are extremely high. ...The international prestige of the United States, and a substantial part of our in- fluence are directly at risk in Vietnam. ...Any negotiated withdrawal wo uld mean surrender on the installment plan.” 13"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"MacNamara’s War 163 No t just Johnson, MacNamara, and Ta ylor had their pride on the line, but the whole nation.

Still, as late as 1964, Johnson chose not to admit that he would send half a million American boys to do the f ighting that Asian boys wouldn’t or couldn’t do. America was an empire, but still a reluctant one. Maybe he didn’t know himself. Besides, it was pr obably not a good time to mention it. MacNamara, in testi mony before defense subcommittees of Congr ess, failed to disclose the level of troop commitments the administration knew wo uld be required. MacNamara testif ied to the Defense Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee on August 4, 1965, that 175,000 troo ps would have to be deployed by November, to be followed by an- other 100,000 the following year. He did not bother to say that he already estimated the need for an additional 340,000 men to be added to the tour through the draft and extended tours. Tw o years later, MacNamara testif ied before the Senate Armed Ser- vices Committee. Asked whether he could provide a monthly breakdown of the costs of Vietnam, he said, “It is almost impossible to do it on a year ly basis, and it is really impossible to do it on a monthly basis. I can tell you how much we are spending in total for defense per month of course, but splitting that into Vietnam and non-Vietnam is honest ly al- most impossible.” 14 Wilson ’s platform slogan when he ran for a second term was “He Kept Us out of War.” Franklin Roosevelt ran for off ice saying he would not send troops to f ight in Europe’s war. And in the election campaign of 1964, Lyndon Johnson maintained that it was still a Vietnamese war, not an American one. The spirit of empire got the bet ter of all of them. Whether you wanted to get into the Vietnam War, or stay out of it, you could f ind all the r easons and arguments you could want. But the argu- ments scarcely mattered; temperatures were already rising; war fever was bubbling up all over. “Agg r ession and upheaval, in any part of the world,” said Lyndon John son on the 1964 campaign trail, sounding Wilsonian, “carry the seeds of destruction to our own freedom and perh aps to civilization it- self....Friendly cynics and fierce enemies alike often underestimate or ignore the strong thread of moral purpose which runs through the fabric of American history.” 15"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"164 WOODROW CROSSES THE RUBICON By the early 1960s, there was hardly a half-wit in all North America wh o didn’t think that the country was in danger. This time it wasn’t the Hu ns wh o threatened Western civilization; it was communists. They’d heard it on television. Even the Ne w York Times said so. In a modern democracy, it is relatively easy to stir the masses to ab- surdity. People are all tuned into the national t elevision stations and read the papers. Just as Americans in 1917 came to believe that their way of life had been put in jeopa rdy by the Germans, now they came to believe that the communists were a grave and growing threat. If they we ren’t stopped in Vietnam, said the papers, soon they’d be landing in California. It was preposterous. But that didn’t make it unpopular. In the mid- and late-1960s, the war in Vietnam seemed like the biggest, most urgent foreign policy chal len ge the United States faced. The French were gone; now Vietnam could be added to America’s slushy empire. There was little question in Americans’ minds that they could succeed where the frogs had failed. Curiously, but not unexpectedly, pub lic support for the war grew as the United States got itself in deeper. The big question: “Why are we involved in this war?” disappeared, pushed out by a mo re urgent and practical qu estion: “How are we going to win it?” In the middle of all this, though, the economic aspects (the cost of the war itself ) as well as the required level of “boots on the ground” were purposely understated. It was apparent, even within the Johnson administration, th at there would be little support for the war if the real costs were known. Head of the Council of Economic Advisors, Walter Heller (who resigned in 1966 and was succ eeded by Gardner Ackley) said in 1965: We had no conc rete idea how much Vietnam was going to cost. First, I think fundamentally it was being underestimated to begin with. And, second, some of the estimates were somehow or another not getting across the Potomac from the Pentagon to the Executive Off ice Build- ing, at least not to the Council’s part of the Executive Off ice Building.

As a bulwark against the commies, the Diem regime proved as ineffective as it was quirky. The United States gave the go-ahead to a group of generals to replace the brothers. This decision, like so ma ny others, was not taken after careful consideration of the alternatives by the top policymakers. MacNamara says it was inspired by lower-echelon functionaries who set it in motion while Kennedy, MacNamara, and the leading decision makers were on va cation. Then, it took on a momentum of its own. On November 2, 1963, a group of generals led by General Minh rounded up Ngo Dinh Diem and Madame Nhu. Their hands were bound behind their backs and they were shoved into an armored personnel carrier. When the vehicle arrived at General Headquarters, Diem and Nhu had been shot; Nhu had also been k nifed several times. The South Vietnamese said it was a suicide. The two were, no doubt, capable of great mischief. But people who have their hands tied behind their backs do not often shoot and knife themselves. The off icial version of events serves as a eulogy for the ent ire Vietnam adventure—impr obable at the very l east, criminal at worst. Meanwhile, the war ratcheted up another big notch after an inc ident in the Tonkin Gulf, involving two attacks on U.S. ships. One of the at- tacks was never conf irmed; many think it never happened. The other may have been a mistake. The North Vietnamese now say they never autho- rized it. Americans said they believed Hanoi was intentionally widening the war. The United States felt it had to r etali ate, not for any particular reas on, but me rely bec ause it felt it had to do something and didn’t know wh at else to do. Before long, the United States had 200,000 of its own troops in Vietnam and was bombing Hanoi “back to the Stone Age.” 17 Finally, after American troop levels in Vietnam reached half a million, and nearly half a trillion dollars (adjusted to year 2000 dollars) had been spent, and noncombatants were being killed or seriously injured at the rate of 1,000 a week (MacNamara’s estimate), Americans came to their senses. The idealists left the State Department and the Defense Department. Realist s, led by Henry Kissinger, came in and f igured out how to abandon South Vietnamese allies and sneak out of the war in the least disgraceful way th ey could. Vietnam then did fall to the communists and America’s erstwhile al- lies we re reedu cated. But was the world better or worse? No one knew or cared.

What that had to do with Vietnam is not entirely clear; the world breat hed a sigh of relief when Vietnamese communists invaded the place to restore order. FACI NG T H E ENEMY A quarter century later, MacNamara and a group of associates confronted a team led by his old adversary, Vo Nguyen Giap, in a series of meetings held in Hanoi, between 1995 and 1998. The exchange was advertised as an attempt to learn som ething. It is recorded in a book by MacNamara, Argument without End: In Search of Answers to the Vietnam Tragedy. Appropriately, there is a photo of that archworld improver, Woodrow Wi lson, at the beginning of the book. We do not know what inspiration Robe rt MacNamara drew from Wilson, but we guess it was the worst sort. Wilson had sent 112,000 Americans to their deaths in World War I in an effort to win a war to end all wars. The result was the opposite of Wi lson’s stated intention. But instead of reaching the obvious conclu- sion—that Wilson was a dimwit—MacNamara rushed to do som ething just as foolish. At the height of the war in April 1969, American troops in Vietnam numbered 543,000, at a cost of $61 billion per year—far, far more than the administration’s estimates of $5 billion per year maximum provided bac k in 1965 (a f igure that seemed to emerge time and ag ain amid the vague generalizations MacNamara and others offered). MacNamara’s book makes amusing reading. It describes a futile effort on thep arto fthe American team to get their Vietnamese counterparts to takeam easure of the blame for what they regarded as a “tragedy.” The Vietnamese saw no tragedy and accepted no blame. Instead, the way they see it, their country was attacked by foreigners —f irst the Fren ch, the nthe Japanese,thent he French again, with support from America, and then by the Ameri cans. They had undertaken a long, costly war to liberate the countr y—against a vastly superior military force. It was no tragedy; it was acrime."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"MacNamara’s War 167 On the American side, MacNamara and his fellow imperialists were determined to keep morality out of the discussion. They regarded the whol e affair as a series of unfortunate errors, miscalculations, misunder- standings, and mistakes. They faced their former enemies not as sinners or criminals, but as incompetents. They seemed practically desper ate for the Viet namese to play along, to admit that they, too, made mistakes that con- trib uted to the misunderstanding that led to the tragedy. But the old An- namites wouldn’t cooperate. Asked, for example, if the North Vietnamese hadn’t misread the signal implied in President Johnson’s bo mbing campaign that began March 5, 1965 (called “Rolling Thunder”), the Vietnamese deleg ates protested. They didn’t know it was a signal. They thought the Americans were try- ing to kill them. In almost every instance, MacNamara and the rest of the American team tried to keep the discussion on strategic issues, diplomatic initiatives, inputs, outputs, throughputs, and other mumbo jumbo. Even three dec ades after the fact, despite the public weeping, MacNamara seems al- most not to notice that he sent men to kill, who were not always too par- ticular about whom they killed. When a man sticks a knife in his neighbor, it is not easy to disguise what is really happening. The event is right in front of him. But the fog of war, as Clausewitz called it, multiplies by the square of the distance from it. In the Oval Off ice or the war rooms of the Pentagon, the transactions that took place in Vietnam became “costs” or “losses” or “collateral damage.” It was as if they were running an insurance company. The losses were regrettable perhaps, but also ex- cusable and general ly, forg ettable. The Vietnam War, 1961 to 1975, was far bloodier than we are accus- tomed to think. America lost 58,000 troops. The Vietnamese lost an esti- mated 3.8 million, according to MacNamara. Yet, reading the whiz kid’s account of his involvement ,itisasifhehadnevermetasingleoneofthem. Every human being in the war was treated as war matériel. They were re- sources, like bombs and cans of Coke. Treated as assets on the military bal- ance sheet, they are expen ded as though they were inf lated currency. Robert MacNamara saw the war as a bounded, engineering problem.

At some point, the cost would become unaccept- ably high. In this sense, he was not unlike the geniuses who ran Long-Term Capital Management into the ground in the late 1990s. They thought the f inancial world could be mo deled, to o—just as if it were science. They reasoned that the odds of an investment going up or down could be calcu- lated just as you could f igure the odds of hitting an iceberg in the North Atlantic. Then you could make your bets calmly, scientif ical ly; after all, it was just advanced mathematics. The economists at Long-Term Capital Management inc luded two winn erso fthe Nobel Prize, but their theories were wrong. Neither in- vesting nor war making is a hard science; they are “human” sciences per- haps, closer to art than science. The difference is obvious. You can heat water to 212 degrees Fahrenheit and it will boil—every time (assuming constant pressure). But put a man under heat or pressure, and the fellow couldr eact in anyn umb er of different, unpredictable, irrational, and wholly bi zarre ways. Between 1965 and 1975, the United States stepped up its killing cam- paign. The Vietnamese suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties as the pressure increased. America was turning up the heat, ready for it to boil over and force the North Vietnamese to the negotiating table. The table was set. But the Americans were astonished when no one showed up. It was as if the North Vietnamese didn’t care how hot it got. It was as if they ignored all the resources the United States was bringing to bear and the losses that they were inf licting. It was as if they couldn’t count! It made no sense to MacNamara. So, he asked the question of the Vietnamese delegation sitting oppos ite him in Hanoi, 30 years later. How come all the misery we inf licted on the Vietnamese did not bring them to ask for a settlement? Tran Quang Co replied: I wou ld like to answer Mr . Ma cN amar a’s question. ...I m ust say that thi s question of Mr. MacNamara’s has allowed us to better understand the issue. During the coffee break, an American colleague asked me if I had learned anything about the U .S. during the discussions of the past few days. And I responded that I have learned quite a lot. However, thanks to this particular question, I believe we have learned still more abo ut the U.S. We understand better now that the U.S. understands very little abo ut Vietnam.

Ho Chi Minh had expected the United States to come to his aid, not to seek his destruction. Yet, MacNamara and President Johnson sent troops to kill people on the basis of an idea so f l imsy that, when the war was over, it disappeared without a trace. Gradually, the wa rw as escalated on the basis of a mistake and run as a series of errors, cul- minating in a disgraceful rout. At every step of the way, American military and civilian off icials misunderstood and underestimated their opponents. Gen eral William Westmoreland briefed Congress in July 1967: “The situa- tion is notas talem ate.

He could have saved himself th e trouble of making it up and taken the communiqué, word for word, sent by French General Raoul Sal an, who in October, 20 years before, reported that the Vietminh were on the run. All that was left were isolated bands susceptible to police operations. “Not once during the war, ”wroteGeneralBrucePalmerinhisbook, Twenty-five Year War, “did the Joi nt Chiefs of Staff advise the commander- in-chief or the secr etary of defense that the str ategy being pursued most probably would fail and that the U.S. would be unable to achieve its ob jectives.” 19 Achieve its objectives? No one really knew what America’s objectives we re. Or if they were attainable. Or, if they really made any difference to anybody in America. The United States had become an empire with sca rcely anyone noticing. Its goals were no lon ger those of its people but of the empire itself.

In 1954, Presi dent Eisenhower provided his now famous “dom ino” speech, by way of explaining that if South Vietnam were lost to communism all of Indochina would fall. In November 1995, General Vo Nguyen Giap put it to Robert MacNamara generously: Do minoes, dominoes, dominoes—this theory was an illusion. What- ever happened in Vietnam had nothing to do with what happened in Laos, nothing to do with Indonesia. ...I am amazed that even the brightest people—people like yourself—could have believed it. 20 Believ ed it? What was there to believe? That a state—an abstract as we ll as physical thing, of 35 million people (in 1965) of various cultures, languages, religions, ethnic and racial groups, political preferences, mod- ernization, and sexual preferences, living in a land of 127,000 square miles ( about the size of New Mexico), including mountains, swamps, beaches, plains, jungle, hamlets, and cities could be understood as a small, three-dimensional object painted in two colors! The idea was not stupid. It wa s just absurd. Einstein had said that things should be made as simple as poss ible, but no simpler. America’s empire builders of the 1960s had gone too far. It was as if they had simp lified the Old T estament as: “Jews kick butts in the Holy Lan d.” They had lost the nuan ces and details that made it interesting. Whether Laos or Cambodia would be affected by events in Vietnam, no one cou ld say. But what they could say with complete assurance was that Vietnam was not a domino. If proximity caused nations to change their po- litical systems why hadn’t West Germany become like East Germany? Why did Switzerland keep its federal system when it was surrounded by central- ized governments? And who ever heard of dominoes that fell only in one direction? If the presence of a communist South Vietnam might cause Thai- land to topple toward communism, mightn’t the presence of Thailand on its bor der cause South Vietnam to topple toward constitutional monarchy? It w as not merely mad to kill people on the basis of the domino the- ory, it was Wilsonian. But once the madness took hold, there was nothing stopping it.

They f igured the communists were taking over everywhere. If Vietnam also fell to communists, it would be a disaster. But why? No one seemed to recall. Yes, there were the dominoes. If Vietnam went communist, so might all of Southeast Asia. We now know that it was nonsense. But what if it had been true? If the people of South east Asia wanted to “go communist,” wh o were we to tell them not to? It was only because America presumed to empire that the question even came up. Empires are involved in con- stant warfare—the struggle to control vassal states on the periphery. Typ- ically, they do so to maintain order throughout the empire, as well as to obtain new sources of tribute. But our answer presumes a logic that isn’t there. Empires f ight for dominoes—not for any particular, logical reason, but merely because they are empires. MacNamara points out that leading intellectuals, the media, politi- cians, policymakers, and even street bums viewed the war as a struggle be- tween comm unism and the Free World. Co uld not Vietnam have been independent, but neutral in the Cold Wa r? Why did it matter anyway; Vietnam was still a primitive, mostly agri cultural nation. Whichever side gained her allegiance, what did they gain? Nobody ever seemed to ask—either themselves or the other side. “I am aghast at the shallowness of our thinking on the issue of a neu- tral solution,” writes MacNamara. “Why didn’t we ask Hanoi for a full explanation of the process they foresaw? If we had asked, and if they had convinced us, for example, that they foresaw reunif ication taking years, even decades, my god, we would have or should have jumped at it.” 21 In the discussions and confessions 30 years after the end of the war, the Vietnamese said they had been open to sug gestion.

Nobo dy knew anything worth knowing. Nobody understood anything worth understanding. And nobody did anything worth doing. But we return to the critical question: Americans were dead set against letting Vietnam “go communist.” Why? If a group of people in Co lumbus, Ohio, dec ided to pool their property and to live collectively, there would be no terrible outcry. (Though eventually, the Feds would probably get them on a weapons or tax char ge.) The only plausible reason for being against communism is that the communists were almost invari- ably world-improvers themselves. They were not content to collectivize their own property, but insisted on collectivizing other people’s property, too. Then, when they had made a mess of their own country, they turned their sights on the countries next door. The feature that made communism barbaric was not that people shared thes ame toothbrush or denied the prof it motive. Instead, it was thec om mon mar ko fall barbarism—the readiness to use brute force to get what you want. What marks a civilized society, on the other hand, is ar eluctance to use force, preferring per suasion and cooperation over force and fraud. There are only two ways to get what you want in life. You can get it hon estly, by trade, work, or some other bargain—an economic means of some sor t. Or, you can get it dis hon estly, by stealing it or taking it away from some one —that is, by politic al m eans. There is no other way, save a miracle. This distinction works for “things” such as automobiles and wh iskey. It also wo rks for other “wants”—such as sex, ambition, and van- ity. We can build our reputations and our own amour propre by ec onomic means; say, by working hard we can earn money and feel superior to oth- ers. Or we can pick a f ight with others to prove we can beat them. Into wh ich category does the effort to “bomb North Vietnam back to the Stone Age” f it? American involvement in Vietnam may have been well- intentioned, but it was missing the point. Martin Luther King confronted the contradiction in a famous speech. “My opposition to the war,” he said: ... grows o ut of my experience in the ghettoes of the North over the last three years—especially the last three summers.

Their questions hit home, and I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violen ce of the oppressed in the ghettos without having f irst spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today—my own government.

So, there is always a certain resistance to higher taxes, and in 1966 and 1967, Lyndon Johnson was loath to run into it. But there was resistance to bankrupting the country, too. There were still a few geezers in Congress who believed in balanced budgets. So, after the 1966 elections, Johnson’s 10 percent tax sur charge was presented. This, he said, would give the United States “staying power,” in its f ight with com munism. Robert MacNamara now claims that he knew the war was hopeless as early as 1964, so staying power was exactly what the United States didn’t need. What it n eeded was the courage to q uit.

The southern Demo crats an d northern Republicans wanted spending cuts, not tax hikes. Johnson said: They will live to rue the day when they made that decision, because it is a dangerous decision ...an unwise decision....I know it doesn’t add to your polls and your popularity to say we have to have additional taxes to f ight this war abroad and f ight the problems in our cities at hom e. But we can do it with the gross national product we have. We shou ld do it. And I think when the American people and the Congress get the full story they will do it. 4 By 1968, the empire was going broke. Gold reserves were being de- pleted. Congress had to act, passing the 10 percent tax surcharge along with a budget cut of $18 billion (about a 10 percent cut in appropria- tions). Johnson had to melt some butter to get more guns. At the tim e, Washington still operated on old-fashioned Keynesian econom ics and a gold standard. Economists believed government could spend more heavily in times of war or times of economic hardship (to “prime the pump”), but it was still widely agreed that what was borrowed must be paid back. Def icits still mattered, partly because they threatened the nation’s currency (and its gold backing), and partly because policy- makers still thought they would have to make up overspending now by underspending in the future.

They said they were extending fr eedom at home as we ll as abroad. “How can a nyone say that a nation with an income of mo re than $800 billion can’t afford a $30 billion war?” said Paul Douglas of Illinois. 5 “Mi litary forces able to defend the cause of freedom in Viet nam and to counter other threats to national security require substantial resources.

Americans favored more guns and more but ter, over a reduction in spending on either front, by a margin of 48 percent to 39 percent, according to a Harris poll. Un til the Vietnam era, after every previous war was over, federal spending dropped. When the Vietnam War ended, however, federal spending continued to go up. The federal budget had been $184 billion in 1969 at the height of the military spending. In 1972, it rose to $231 billion. In 1969, the federal government actually ran a surplus of $3 bil- lion. By 1972, with the war winding down, we expected to see the surpluses continue; but instead the surplus turned into a def icit of $23 billion. Th e empire grew, and kept growing. Before launching the attack on the USSR, June 22, 1941, Hitler remarked that the Soviet Union was like a rickety old house. All we have to do, he said, was “kick in the door and the whole thing will fall down.” He was 48 years premature. The Soviet Union fell apart in 1989 by itself; America didn’t even have to kick in the door. But even af ter the Cold War was over, the federal budget continued to rise, from $1.14 trillion in 1989 to $1.38 trillion in 1992. The Great Society was merely the domestic wing of America’s new system of imperial f inance. Johnson offered more bread and more circuses than any president before h im. The f ive-year cost of administering the Great Society programs was estimated at $305.7 billion (in 2005 inf lation- adjusted dollars). This does not include the $250 billion in college loans and grants to 29 million students since 1965 (see Figure 8.3). The scope of the Great Society was massive, comparable to Franklin Ro osevelt’s New Deal programs but on a more expensive scale.

By the year 2000, annual levels were at $6.68 trillion —46 times high er than at the end of the Second World War. But what followed Nixon immediately was an era of f inancial turmoil that has rarely been equaled in modern history. The U .S. dollar plunged precipitously; U.S. unemployment exc eeded 10 percent; oil prices sky- rocketed to $39 a barrel; the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell to 570; gold reached $800 an ounce; and U.S. inf lation and interest rates climbed to double-digit levels. Imagine an investor who bought a 30-year U.S. Treasury bond in 1970. Did he not have a right to expect to receive a dollar back for every dollar lent? And shouldn’t he have been able to expect that each of those dollars he received—in the year 2000 —would be worth about as much as those he had given up? We can measure the damage by looking at the price of gold. In 1970, each dollar would buy an investor 1 ⁄ 34 of an ounce of gold. Thirty-f ive years later, Mr. Market, sitting as judge and jury, tells us that a dollar is wo rth less than 1 ⁄ 425 of an ounce of gold.

No national assembly could undermine its value or pass a law that increased it. When a nation’s gold horde was in danger, it quickly adjusted its policies to correct the imbalance and protect its gold. The dollar, on the other hand, is merely a piece of paper, and since Nixon slammed the gold window shut it is backed by nothing more than the full faith and credit of the United States Treasury. How good a prom ise is that? No one knows for sure. Th e governm ent set up the Federal Reserve in the f irst place because it wanted a stooge currency. Gold is f ine, they said, but it’s antisocial.

We need a dollar that is not linked to gold. In the ma ny years since the Federal Reserve was set up in 1913, gold has remained as steadfast and immobile as ever.

As a result, guess how much a dollar is worth today in comparison to one in 1913? Five cents.

Whenever they felt they needed more of it, the dollar was right there, ready for duty. There was a crack in that bell, too.

Now you’re the on es who have gone mad.” Our guest had described the world of the ninet eenth and twentieth cent uries—the days when the idea of an American empire was still re- pug nant and absurd. While wars, revolutions, and pogroms, stormed over Europe—and much of the rest of the world—America kept to itself, reluctant to get involved. Attractive new id eas popped up all over Eu- rope like poisonous mushrooms. But, for the most part, Americans kept their heads. Most went about their business, seeking happiness in their own private ways—trying to get rich. “The business of America is busi- ness,” Calvin Coolidge explained.

Still, we miss those fuddy-duddies. You could count on them to resist the tyranny of the here and now. When something new presented itself, they wouldn’t like it. They would resist it, not from any intellectual point of view, but the way a man resists a new pair of shoes or a dog resists a new collar. The new styles might be more fashionable, but that was reason enough to avoid them. As a creed, conservatism has lost all its adhe rents, at l east in the United States. As a philosophy, it has practically disappeared. As a political move- ment, it has dropped dead. Everyone likes new things now. Th ee ssential quality of conservatism is not a specif ic agenda (neither to lower taxes nor to raise th eflag),itismerel yawayof looking at thi ngs—suspiciously; and of reacting to new proposals—dragging one’s feet.

But now the geezers have dyed their hair and had their faces lifted. The codgers ref inance their houses, pay with credit cards, and vote for whoever promises them the most of someone else’s money. In politics, and in money, the grumps go along with whatever is popular—just like ev- eryone else. Ab out the only thing you can still count on is vanity—it never seems to go out of style. In the here and now, every generation is the greatest one that ever lived. Every empire is permanent, and ever yone who makes trou ble for it is an evil subhuman. In the early part of the twenty-f ir st century, America’s neoconserva- tive he irs to th e Wilsons—Woodrow Wilson and Ronald Wilson Rea- gan—became the earth’s most dynamic and ambitious empire builders. “T hese Cold Warriors were mostly liberals of a special, ideologically zeal- ous variety,” explained an article in the American Conservative: Many of th em had come from the extreme Left. They had opposed comm unism because they had universalistic objectives of their own and did not want any competition. These proponents of a single model for all societies were able to form an alliance with putative conservatives, wh o had come to believe during the Cold War that to be conservative was always to be hawkish and assertive in foreign policy. Used to “standing up for America,” these nationalistic and saber-rattling con- servatives found in the cause of a better world, a new outlet for their desire to exercise American power. 1"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"194 EV ENING IN AMERICA Th e neocons preached a rousing sermon of “global democratic revolu- tion,” to quote George W.

According to former Secr etary of the Tr easury Paul O’Neill, the leader of the free world had a little troubl e following the foreign policy discussions in the White House. But George W. Bush is a shrewd politician who knows a good slogan when someone gives it to him. He saw immediately the ad- vantages of attacking Mesopotamia—it gave him cover to spend more than any president had ever spent, with hardly a peep of pro test. Traditional con- servatives were struck dumb by this hawkish audacity. Alas, sometimes it is better to lose a war than to win one. Victory see ms to lead to disgrace more often than glory, especially when you are on the roa d to building an empire. Af ter the West won its Cold War with the Soviet U nion, the neocons desperately longed for a new enemy. While they were searching, one found them. Now, in the opening years of the twent y-f irst century, the Huns are our friends. And the commies are our new business partners. Now it is the Muslims of the world who must be defeated! The Muslim mind, accord- ing to neoconservative scholars, is locked in the past: it mistreats women, it is antidemocratic, antiprogress, nihilist, and profoundly, irretrievably stuck in a death struggle with the good guys in the enlightened, free, open-minded, fun-loving, capitalist West. Why this should be so has yet to be clarif ied. Has not the Muslim mind been around for 1,000 years? Did it not evolve according to its own program, just like the Christian mind, the Confucian mind, or the muddled mind of a Democrat? Are there not many millions of Muslims? Are Muslims less smart than Chris- tians or Jews? And yet, the new conservative thinkers could not imagine that the world would be safe unless Muslims were brought into the empire under their heel.

Here was an opportunity for the United States to make the Islamic world safe for democracy. Here was a way to improve the world and an almost foolproof way for America to make a public spectacle of itself, go further into debt, and expand its empire! Th e old-t ime con servatives would have been suspicious of such big ideas, especially when they were so f lattering. When a man f latters you, it is almost certain that he means to take your business, pick your pocket, or sleep with your wife. When a man f latters himself, he might just as well put a revolver in his mouth and pull the trigger, for he has lost all touch with reality. We ma y be the good guys in the here and now, the old-timers would say, but if we want to be the good guys in the future, we have to do good thi ngs. They would recall that people who mind business other than their own almost always come to tears. Men are neither good nor bad, the old conservatives would say, but subject to inf luence. Tr a ditional American conservatism was not a doctrine of world im- provem ent ,but a mood of skepticism toward all “isms” and empire builders. Polit ica l conservatism is undergirded by two important principles. The f irst principle holds that since most innovations are failures, people should view any proposed change to th e traditional order with skepticism. That doesn’t mean you can’t innovate in a society, but the burden of proof should always be on the world improvers to show that their proposed change will make things better—som ething they can almost never do. The second principle of old-time conservatism is the political equiva- lent of Adam Smith’s observation about free markets: “The knowle dge re- quired to coordinate and direct a complex, dynamic society is clearly beyond any individual or bureaucratic machin e.” In short, central plan- ning doesn’t work very well, neither in Washington nor in Baghdad. But we add our own little corollary to the knowledge principle— phony knowle dge increases the larger the undertaking and the farther you get from it, by the square of the distance and the cube of the scale. That is wh y the old-time conservatives are suspicious of any grand plan to im- prove th e world—even if it promises to make the world more free. Old time con servatives don’t believe in “freedom.” ...“Just don’t tell me what to do,” they say. The wor ld can be improved; we don’t deny it.

Ronald Reagan’s genius was that he was able to see that high taxes and regulation did not make the world a better place, but a worse one. M ilton Fried man’s th ree-part for- mu la forb etter government—cut taxes, cut taxes, cut taxes— seemed like a decent solution. Re agan had the right instinct. “Get big guv’mint off our backs,” was almost his campaign theme song. When he had the chance, he often did the rig ht thing. Faced with a strike by air-traff ic controllers—the only union to back his campaign—he f ired 10,000 of them. When he saw some “impr ovem ent ” created by his pr edecessors, his instinct was generally to get rid of it. The trouble was that once in Washington, the actor still remembered his lines, but he lost the plot. Almost before he could get his cowboy boots off, he was making improvements of his own. This was especially notable in what is known as foreign policy. Re- pub licans had learned their lesson from the Vietnam War. They still sought to maintain the empire, but by fairly passive means. They merely hoped to “contain” communism—which they saw as a menace. But Rea- gan fell under the spell of the proto-neoconservatives in Washington. Not content to leave things alone, he decided he could improve the world by actively trying to defeat communism. Th is is celebrated as a gr eat and good victory. In her comments on Reagan ’s death, Britain’s Maggie Thatcher said he would be mourned by “m illions of men and women who live in freedom today because of the policies he pursued.” Maybe this is true. Maybe it is not. It is impossible to know what might have happened had Reagan left things alone. Most likely, commu- nism would have fallen apart anyway, perhaps sooner. When a man’s in- vestments go up, he is a genius. He who failed to invest is seen as a fool. By contrast, when investments go down, it is because of events that could not poss ibly have been foreseen. Likewise, in politics, the l ink between ac- tion and consequ ence is forged in a way that always f latters the activists. If som ething turns out reasonably well, it is because some world improver took action and made it that way. If something turns out badly, it is be- cause someone failed to act when he should have.

The Great Emancipa- tor might better be cursed than praised. Likewise, Woodrow Wilson is given credit for all manner of extrava- gant improvements. People rarely mention that he almost single-handedly brought about World War II with his meddling in World War I. Instead, when the subj ect of World War II comes up, Neville Chamberlain’s name arises almost immediately. The poor man gets the blame for trying to avoid wa r—that is, for not taking acti on wh en he should have. Re agan “also helped engineer a huge surge in American patriotism,” wr ites Ross MacKenzie. “The Carter years were a period of American self-doubt about the economy and about American power (with the me mo ry of Vietnam still tormenting most policymakers). Mr. Reagan set about wiping this away. He incr eased military spending by 25 percent between 1981 and 1985. He talked to the American people, not about malaise (as Mr. Carter had done), but about ‘morning in America.’ By the end of his second presidency, much of the talk about American de- cline had gone out of fashion: the country regarded itself once again not only as the world’s greatest superpower, but also as the world’s most dy- namic ec onomy.” 2 Now , we look around and we see no trace of self-doubt. Instead, we see a bub ble in conf idence.

This part of his inaugural address made us think he really was one. But people come to believe what they must believe in order to play their roles—even conservatives. Rea- gan’s real revolution lay in redef ining conservatism as an activist, imperial creed. First, the neocons took over foreign policy. Soon, Americans were stirring up trouble everywhere, from Latin America to Afghanistan. Then, they took over domestic policy. In a few cases, the ghastly remnants of previous improvers—such as 70 percent top marginal rates—were knocked over. In more cases, new edif ices were built up. But the major failure was that the sharp tax cuts of 1981 were not followed by sharp spending cuts. Instead, spending went up. And not just on defense. Rea- gan had pledged to abolish the Department of Education. Instead, he in- crea sed its budget by 50 percent. The Reagan Revolution transformed the Republican Party. Rather than continuing to f ight a rearguard action against leftist activists, Repub- lican s we re emboldened to take the lead, becoming activists themselves. This they did by relying on a monumental fraud. Mu rray Rothbard watched Republicans scam themselves. He wrote:"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Reagan’s Legacy 199 In the spring of 1981, conservative Republicans in the House of Rep- resentatives cried. They cried because, in the f irst f lush of the Reagan Revolut ion th at was supposed to bring drastic cuts in taxes and govern- ment spending, as well as a balanced budget, they were being asked by the White House and their own leadership to vote for an increase in the statutory limit on the federal public debt, which was then scraping the legal ceiling of one trillion dollars. They cried because all their lives they had voted against an increase in pub lic debt, and now they were being asked, by their own party and their own movement, to violate their lifelong principles. The White Ho use and its leadership assured them that this breach in principle wou ld be their last: that it was necessary for one last increase in the debt limit to give President Reagan a chance to bring about a balanced budget and to begin to reduce the debt. Many of these Republicans tearfully announced that they were taking this fateful step because they dee ply trusted their presi dent, who woul d not let them down. 4 “Famous last words,” wrote Rothbard. In a sense, the Reagan handlers were right: there were no more tears, no mo re com plaints, because the principles themselves were quickly for- gotten, swept into the dustbin of history. Def icits and the public debt have piled up mountainously since then, and few people care, least of all con- servative Republi cans. Every few years, the legal limit is raised automati- cally. By the end of the Reagan reign the federal debt was $2.6 trillion; now it is $3.5 trillion and rising rapidly. As we write, September 2005, it is almost $8 trillion. And this is the rosy side of the picture, because if you add in “off-budget” loan guarantees and contingencies, the grand total federal debt is $20 trillion. That is merely the current debt. As we will see later, when Treasury Secr etary Paul O’Neill totaled up the pre sent value of future obligations minus expe cted tax revenues he came to a f igure more th an twice that large. Before the Reagan era, conservatives were clear about how they felt abo ut def icits and the public debt: a balanced budget was good, and def i cits and the public debt were bad. In the famous words of the left- Ke ynesian apostle of “functional f inance,” Professor Abba Lerner, there is nothi ng wr ong with the public debt because “we owe it to ourselves.” In those days, at least, conservatives were astute enough to realize that it made an enormous amount of difference whether—slicing through the"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"200 EV ENING IN AMERICA obfuscatory collective nouns—one is a member of the “we” (the burdened taxpayer) or of the “ourselves” (those living off the proceeds of taxation). Since Reagan, however, intellectual-political life has gone topsy-turvy. Conservatives and allegedly “free-market” economists have twisted them- selv es inside out trying to f ind new reasons why def icits don’t matter. Tod ay, if you were to pose the question to the small-town Republi- can, you might still f ind a faint residue of the Old Religion. But the poor man has been betrayed by his party, by his representativ es, by politics it- self, by the lure of empire, and by his own v ain and fatal urges. He has come to believe what he must. Th ere we re four key elements to Reaganomics. Restrict the money supply to slow inf lation (admirably carried out by Paul Volcker at the Fed). Cut taxes (a 25 percent across-the-board tax cut was enacted in 1981). Balance the budget by controlling domestic spending. (A complete failure—def icits grew larger than ever.) And reduce government regula- tion. ( Ditto.) The f irst two objectives were more or less achieved. They produced mo re or less what Milton Friedman expected. But neither was an activist measure. Both merely undid some of the worst damage done by previous officeho lde rs. Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Jimmy Carter had made a mess of the economy. Ronald Reagan and Paul Volcker helped clean it up. But even the cleanup lacked the necessary suds and elbow grease. Instead, the dirt and clutter were mostly let alone, while new trash was heaped on. The big cut in taxes gave people more money to spend. It was equiv- alent to an increase in demand. Consumers began a buying spree, while government borrowed the money to fund the def icit. Where did the extra spending power come from? Few people asked. If they had thought about it, they would have realized that, collectively, they were me rely going further into debt to upgrade their standards of living. If th ey had ref lected on it deeply, they would have realized that they were running up bills that future generations would have to pay; they were spending money that their children and grandchildren hadn’t earned yet. For what was a national debt, but an intergenerational obligation, a bur- den placed on infants by their parents and grandparents? Ha rdly anyone thought about it then—or since.

If only the restrictions imposed on the economy by previous generati ons of world i mprovers could be removed, they said, the economy would boom and people would get rich. Thus, it came to be that taxes were cut and the economy boomed. But what the new supply-siders had done was nothing more than admin- ister an old-fashioned Keynesian boost. John Maynard Keynes, a British economist of the early twentieth century, had given world improvers a tool. He showed that nations could be winched out of recessions by easy credit and government spending. When private spenders eased off, he noted, government could take up the slack—by running def icits. Where would the money come fr om? He expected governments to run sur- plus es in good times so they would have money to spend in bad ones. Had government actually done so, the Keynesian system would have at least been hon est. But this was the part the politicians never particularly liked, and the part of his plan they never could quite follow. It was all very well to spend money. Only curmudgeonly conservatives com- plained about that. Otherwise, spending money made everyone happy. But not spending money was another matter. Not spending meant less bread and fewer circuses, and fewer clowns on the public payroll. It meant explaining to voters that they wouldn’t get the new road or new me dical services that had been promised. It meant lower demand and less new money in circulation, the very opposite of the boom everyone loved so much. Politicians had no trouble giving the economy the boost that Keynes had suggested. But when it came to saving mon ey to have something to give a boost with, the time never seemed q uite right. The moment fo r un- derspending never seemed to com e. Like fat men at a wedding feast, poli- cymakers told themselves they would eat less after the party was over, to ma ke up for their gluttony now. But in public f inance, there is never a good time for fasting. When the Reagan team arrived in Washington, the nation had been living with Keynesian def i cits for many years. Savers and lenders had grown wary. Consumer price inf lation hit 13.5 percent in 1980. Lenders feared it would go higher still. They demanded protection. In 1980, 30- year mortgages could be had at 15 percent interest. By the following year, the mortgage rate rose to a peak of 18.9 percent. But then, Paul Volcker’s anti-inf lation policies at the Fed began to pay off. Investors did not yet know it, but the bond market had found its"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"202 EV ENING IN AMERICA bot tom. For the next two and a half decades, bonds would go up. Bond yield s—a measure of what people must pay to borrow—went down. Thus, were the two corn erstones of the Reagan era in place—lower taxes and low er real cost of credit. Neither was an improvement to America’s system of imperial f inance. Both were merely corrections to previous meddling. Ta xes had been raised so that the government would have money to spend on its imperial programs: bread and circuses at home; wars at the periphery. High bond yields (a high cost of credit) were the result of Keynesian poli- cies. Neither problem was caused by neglect. Instead, both were the in- evitable debris of previous improvements, previous innovations in the f ield of economics, and previous generations of self-aggrandizing empire builders posing as do-gooders. After Reagan’s tax cuts, U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average rate of 3.2 percent per year throughout the eight years of Rea- gan’s two terms. This was a bit more than the 2.8 percent average gain in the eight years before and substantially more than the 2.1 percent of the eight years following. Still the growth was slower than it had been in the 1960s, after Kennedy’s 30 percent tax cut of 1964 produced 5 percent an- nual GDP rates. Meanwhile, real median household income rose from $37,868 in 1981 to $42,049 in 1989. This, too, was much better than the rate of growth before or after the Reagan years. But much of it—maybe all of it—came not from real increases in wages, but simply from more peop le working longer hours, as we illustrated in our previous book. Re al wage increases require three things: Fir st, the society must save mon ey so that it has the capital to invest. Second, it must invest the savings in prof itable businesses. Third, these capital investments must result in in- crea sed productivity. Alas, none of these things happened. Instead, these three critical thi ngs began trending in the wrong direction. National savings—includ- ing public savings—fell from 7.7 percent in the 1970s to only 3 percent by 1990. Business investment fell from 18.6 percent of GDP in the 1970s to 17.4 percent in the 1980s. And productivity? In the 25 years after World Wa r II, output per employee had risen at an average rate of 2.8 percent per year. During the 1980s, this rate fell to less than 1 percent. There was a bump in productivity after 1995, but this was largely a feature of the L abor Department’s new way of ca lculating it. With falling savings, falling business investment, and (consequently) falling productiv- ity, you could not expect the economy to do very well. It didn’t."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Reagan’s Legacy 203 Wh ile the supply side of supply-side economics was a total f lop, the dem and side was a stunning success. The Reagan team at least f igured out how to pay for an empire: Borrow. As a percentage of GDP, federal government receipts fell from 20.2 in 1981 to 18.6 in 1992. But spending rose from 22.9 percent in 1981 to 23.5 percent in 1992. Naturally, debts rose. By the end of 1992, the federal debt was more than $4 trillion. When Re agan took over, it was less than $1 trillion. No fraud is so lovable as the illusion of getting something for nothing. But som ething-for-nothing was just what the new conservatives now prom ised voters—just like the Democrats. The difference was that the De mo cra ts pledged to steal the money from the rich (Re publicans) . The Re pub licans promised to create it in a free economy, like Jesus multiply- ing the loaves and f ishes at Beth Saida. “Voodoo economics,” was how George Bush described it. OR IGINS OF SUPPLY SIDE When supply-side economics f irst appeared in the American press, real economists were perplexed. They had never heard of it. There were no uni versity departments specializing in it. There were no pe er-reviewed papers. There were no scholarly books describing it. There were scarcely any economists claiming to be supply-siders. It was, apparently, a school of thought without a school. Some wondered if it also lacked a thought. Tr aditional economists—mostly empire builders and world improvers, but of the Keynesian variety—had gotten themselves stuck on a teeter- totter. On one end sat inf lation. On the other was employment. They could press down on one end, but the other would rise up and hit them on the chin. There seemed to be no way o ut. No free lunch. It seemed that they would have to pay for every something with something else. If they wa nted to reduce inf lation, it would cost them jobs. If they wanted to in- crease employment, consumer prices would rise. Milton Friedman, among others, warned that Keynesianism was just fold erol. As soon as peop le realized what the government was doing, the jig would be up. They would merely raise prices in anticipation of inf la- tio n, without increasing production. Stagf lation —rising prices in a slug- gish econom y—would result. Other economists pointed out that any"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"204 EV ENING IN AMERICA attempt to m anipulate the business cycle would fail for the same reason. Once the policy were known, people would adjust their behavior to it, nullifying its effectiveness. They would not mistake inf lation for greater demand: th ey would not increase production; they would not hire more workers; they would not spend more money. The only thing the policy- makers could possibly do that would have an effect would be something peop le did not expect. And that could only be a policy of random manip- ulations—which would cause further confusion and who-knew-what re- sults. Keynesians, even new Keynesians, never had any real answer to this problem. But that didn’t stop them. They decided to ignore it. Meddlers and empire builders can’t be bothered with theoretical proble ms; they are too busy creating a better world! Stagflation came in the 1970s, just as Milton Friedman had said it wo uld. It was not the better world the Keynesian economists had hoped to create. But it was the world they got. ( Like ever yone else, world im- provers don’t get exactly what they expect; they get what they deserve.) Stagflation posed a problem with no easy solution. Prices were rising, but emp loym ent was f lat. Policymakers wanted to increase employment, but they were loath to add more inf lation. They could try to lower inf lation, but that would hurt employment even more. Along came the supply-siders. They had no real solution. But at least they had a way to hide the problem. What both the public and the politi- cians wanted, they noted, was employment without price increases. They wanted a booming economy and no inf lation. Voters wanted money from government; they also wanted to lower taxes. The trouble with traditional conservative economists was that they we re alwa ys pointing out the true cost of things. “There’s no such thing as a free lunch,” was practically tattooed on their foreheads. Conserva- tive econom ists typically argued against government debt, against def i cits, and against more spending, against activism in all its forms; they knew there would be a price to be paid for it, eventually. This at- titude m ade conservative economists deeply unpopular. They were, after all, party poopers. Who would want such a killjoy around? None could ev er be elected to high off ice. The es sence of politics was promis- ing things that couldn’t be delivered honestly. If a man could get no mo re from an election than what he actually earned, why would he bother to vote at all?"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Reagan’s Legacy 205 Th e suppl y-siders’ proposal seemed to of fer som ething for ever yone — at no cost to a nyone. Taxes could be cut, said Arthur Laffer; lower taxes wo uld create such a boom that output would go up—eliminating inf la- tion. Government revenues would go up, too—even at lower tax rates. The budget would be balanced. Most importantly, it offered a way to get conservatives elected—b y turning them into big spenders. RE AL BOOMS VERSUS THE PHONY VARIETY Re al booms need real money. Typically, people save money when they are wary an d spend it when they are f lush. The spending is real. The money is real. The boost in sales is real. The prof its are real. But a boo m that people build on phony money is itself phony. Every step of the way takes them in the wrong direction. The demand is an illu- sion. The spending is a mistake. The money is suspect. And the resulting business prof its are not merely temporary, they are nothing more than next year’s sales disguised as this year’s earnings. A man who borrows money to begin his spending spree contributes nothi ng to the economy. Every dollar he spends must someday be with- drawn. It must be paid back. Imagine that he borrows $1 million. In a small town, that sum might be enough to set off a boom. He buys a new car. He goes out to the restaurant. He gives money to church and charities. He takes a holiday. He orders a new suit. He builds a new wing on his house. Soon, the mo ney is out of his pocket. But it is not gone. It has found a new home in pockets all over town. And now the butcher, the baker, the builder, the travel agent, and many others are all planning little additions to their own standards of living. But imagine the disappointment when, the following year, the man wh o spent so freely no longer comes around. He is not seen at the tailor, or at the travel agent, or at the restaurant, or the car dealer. He is not even seen so frequ ent ly at his old haunts. Not only does he not spend as freely as he did the year before, he barely spends at all. For now he must cut his regular spending by enough to pay back the $1 million plus interest. Net spending in the town will actually go down, over a multi-year period, by the amount of interest he pays (assuming that the loan came from outside the community)."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"206 EV ENING IN AMERICA (W e invite readers to consider the current U.S. situation—when loans from overseas surpass $600 billion per year.) Th e suppl y-siders’ key insight was that government is essentially a parasite. It lives off its host like a leech. And like any bloodsucker, it has to be careful not to suck too much. Otherwise, it will weaken its host and ma ybe even kill it. Or, if it sucks too little, it fails to fully exploit the op- portunity and invites competition. Th e supply-siders’ concept was hardly a formula for maximizing indi- vidua l freedom. On the contrary, it was a formula for f inancing an empire by increasing government revenues. Arthur Laffer’s curve merely illus- trates a rational bloodsucker’s optimization strategy; he will get the most at a level that is neither too high nor too low. A government that imposes tax rates that are too high, weakens the economy and ends up with less re- sources than it might otherwise have. This was a problem with commu- nism—it asked too much of its citizens. The poor schleps were drained dry. Democratic regimes in the West took a lower percentage of their cit- izens’ output. But their hosts thrived, giving the government more money to spend. The government of the Soviet Union took less from each citizen than the United States did, but it took a much higher percentage of each citizen’s output. This was why the West won the Cold War; it had f ixed its tax rates lower. But Reagan’s tax cuts were an empty gesture. Without offsetting cuts to federal spending, def icits increased. What really matters to an economy is not the nominal tax rates, but the percentage of the economy’s resources taken away by the government. Actual tax rates in the Soviet Union were zero. The communists claimed the right to 100 percent of production, a por- tion of which was turned over to citizens for personal use. The government’s percent age of production, or what might be called its real tax rate, while diff icult to measure, was very high. That, combined with even more gov- ernment meddling than in the United States, doomed the Soviet experiment. Re agan cut nominal tax rates, but government consumed more and mo re resources. The leech grew. Lower tax r ates gave citizens the impres- sion that th ey had more money to spend. Individually, they did. Collec- tively, they did not. The program was merely a monumental legerdemain. For every tax-cut dollar that a citizen spent, the federal government had to borrow as much as $1.18 (with interest). Still, citizens thought they had more to spend. They spent it.

And now, pardon us if we go over to this dead horse and lay on the wh ip again. Reducing taxes is a conservative, anti-activist, anti-world- improving, anti-pol itical, anti-empire gesture. Taxes are imposed by peo- ple who pretend that the world will be a better place if your money is taken from you and redir ected to others’ pockets. Cutting taxes is a way of remo ving the improvement residues of the past. It is a way of tipping soci- ety aw ay from the political means of doing things back toward civilized, consensual, economic life. The lower the taxes—and here, we speak of real tax rates (the amount of resources consumed by the government)—the mo re mod est the world-improvers’ ambitions. Lowering tax rates was the right idea. But lowering only nominal tax rates, while simultaneously in- creasing the government’s resources, was a sham. Since the tax cut was a sham, so was the resulting boom. It was in- spired by consumer demand that didn’t exist. But the f inancial world is a comp licated, confusing affair with many promiscuous liaisons. Events are engendered by other events. They are path dependent, as econ omists say. One event fathers another. Life was good in the Reagan years. The supply- siders patted each other on the back. “We did it,” they congratulated each other. Someone should have asked for a paternity test. Whereas tax cuts gave consumer spending a temporary boost, bond yield s began a long, solid downtrend. The lower cost of credit was a plus for the economy and for the f inancial markets—at least as important as tax cuts. Falling interest rates made it cheaper to borrow. From experience, peop le expected prices to go up—which would lower the cost of their loans still further. Rising prices would also undermine the value of their saving s. They did the reasonable thing: They borrowed. Stocks rose. Things were looking up. It was “morning in America.” The questions would have to wait until evening. FUNNY NUMBERS Since 1913, the costs of do-gooders, empire-builders, and worl d-improvers has been a dding up. By the 1970s, it had begun to depress productivity rates. Instead of growing at 2.8 percent per year (the rate since World War II), productivity rose only about 1 percent from 1973 to 1984."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"208 EV ENING IN AMERICA Since then, the rates themselves have become fraudu len t: In 1995, De- partment of Labor off icials began to crunch the numbers into such odd and awful shapes, even their own mothers would no longer recognize the m. The practice known as hedonic pr ice indexing based on “chained dollars” was put into place. Computers came to be valued for their poten- tial to increase productivity rather than their actual cost, dramatically in- flating both th e importance of the tech sector in the economy, and overstating GDP so as to make the number useless. Ne arly half the items in America’s measure of consumer price inf la- tion are “adjusted.” Between 2000 and the end of 2004, for example, spending on com- puters rose 9.3 percent. Since computers became more powerful, however, the number was enhanced to 113.4 percent. Other numbers in the con- sumer price inf lation calculation were adjusted by the substitution effect. If steak rose in price, the statisticians assumed people switched to mutton, thereby reducing their cost of living. So did they adjust the price of housing. It cost a lot more to own a hou se in 2005 than it did in the year 2000, but the boys went to work on the numbers with pliers and a torch. Soon they had twisted the cost of ac- tually owning a house into the cost of renting the same house; “owners’ equivalent rent” they called it. Because the imperial central bank has held interest rates below the consumer price index (CPI) rate for the past three years, people who previously would have rented, now buy. This has re- duced rents even while it increased house pric es. Voilà! The CPI, of which mo re than a quarter is the cost of housing, was held down. The credit bub ble had a similar effect on used cars. Zero f inancing deals turned heads away from used cars and toward new ones. Used car prices fell—and so did this component of the CPI. Together the two items alone—housing and used cars—were responsible for a 1.7 percent drop in core CPI be- tween November 2001 and December 2003. Wh ilee veryone knows it has become much more expensive to make ends me et,these distortions keep the off icial CPI low and the gross domes- tic produ ct (GDP) f igures high. (Nominal o utput is r educed by the off icial CPI number to give the real GDP f igure. The lower the CPI, the higher the resulting GDP f igure.) The productivity f igures are also beaten senseless. Output per hour is distorted by the measure of output itself, which inc ludes bot hh edo nic quality enhancements and inf lation adjustments."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Reagan’s Legacy 209 FORGETTING TO DUCK We t u r n back to the Gipper. When Ronald Wilson Reagan was f inally carried off in June 2004, the nation said goodbye with a soft heart and a head that had turned to mush. His obsequies were as full of humbug as a nat ional election. The man deserved better. He should have been carried off by six jolly cowboys and bid farewell by honest drunks. Instead, Reagan was given a send off worthy of a world-class mounte- bank. We were told that he was responsible for a huge economic boom in the land of the free. He cut marginal tax rates. He helped get the govern- ment off our backs. He defeated communism. Rod Martin wrote a book praising Ronald Reagan for “saving the wo rld...without Reag an,” he says, “We might all be speaking Russian!” We have nothi ng against Russian. But we doubt that, in any reasonably imaginable circumstances, Americans could all have learned to speak Russian in a single generation. They are not that good at languages. But it illustrates how the world-improvers think; if you want to make a better wo rld, you must make others do just as you do. Martin could not imagine a Russian “victory” without imagining that we had to learn to speak the Russian language. He pr obably thought we would have to learn to like vodka and dance like Cossacks, too. [Reagan’s] certainty that people everywhere yearned for fr eedom and that free markets could always outp roduce centrally planned slavery drove his strategies where realpolitik could never go. He replaced both containment and détente with his “Reagan Doctrine,” proclaiming Am erica would actively roll back its foe by helping freedom f ig hters behind the Iron Curtain. 5 Wh at made Reagan so sure that people everywhere yearn for freedom is a mystery; there is no evidence of it. Even Americans, who claim to love freedom as much as a nyone, are much more inter ested in low mortgage rates. They would scrap the entire Bill of Rights in less than 24 hours if it meant guaranteed 10 percent annual real estate gains. And if free markets could alwa ys outproduce centrally planned slavery, why was he worried abo ut losing out to the Soviets? It was obvious we could beat them—be- cause we could afford far more and better weapons."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"210 EV ENING IN AMERICA Realpolitik was Kissinger’s approach to foreign policy. It began by taking peop le as he found them, whether they wanted Western-style free- dom or not, and making the best of th esit uation. This meant generally trying to avoid conf lict without surrendering strategic interests—even imperi al on es. The neo-Wilsonians advising Reagan came up with a more daring doc trine. They wanted to get Kissinger out of the way and remake the wo rld in their own image. Martin does not mention that among the “free- dom f ighters” that the United States dec ided to support w as, notably, Osama bin L aden. The present War on Terror was largely an invention of the neoconservatives. They helped create the enemy and then dev eloped a war again st him.

Yet, in this ode to Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, the man seemed to have taken leave of his senses altogether. Men—free or not—occasionally pick up weapons and begin killing each other. If liberty has anything to do with it, there is no proof for it in the historical record. Ye t, Reagan’s anti-communism resonated with the voters.

Why was Ronald Reagan so eager to get rid of Bolshevism? As long as you didn’t have to live in a communist country, what would it matter to you? Many smart people thought it was a better way. What made the comm unists a menace was not that they were intent on improving their own world with the benef its of collectivism, but that they were deter- mined to improve our world, too. What made them obnoxious was not their own goofy creed, but their determination to do precisely what Ro nald Re agan wa nted to do, rem ake its adv ersary into something more like itself.

MA RX’S REVENGE For the f irst time in two-hundred years, the West (including Westernized Japan) faces real competition. The world’s largest nations—China, India, and Russia—sat on the sidelines for most of the ninet eenth and twentieth cent uries. They were too remote and too backward to participate in the great boom that lifted living standards during the reign of the British Em- pire in the nineteenth century. GDP per capita rose from barely over $1,000 (in 1990 dollars) in the United States at the beginning of the nine- teenth century to more than $5,000 by its end. China, on the other hand, had a GDP per capita of about $600 when the ninet eenth century began. By its end, the f igure had fallen to around $525. Indian numbers were abo ut the same, but in the other direction, with a small gain in the nine- teenth century—probably the r esult of British colonial dev elopment. In the twentieth century, Russia, China, and India all became victims of self- inf licted wounds; various forms of socialist claptrap took them out of eco- nomic competition.

Foreign workers seem to be able to make an ything we can make—but at much lower cost. India is growing at 8 percent a year, China at 9 percent—Russia is booming too. In addition, they are turning millions of young people who can make things—graduates in the practical arts and sciences—better and cheaper than we do in the United States or Europe. What’s more, the foreigners take the old virtues seri- ously. They save their mon ey—the saving rate in China is as high as 40 percent of the national income, according to off icial sources. These sav- ings give them huge piles of capital with which to build more modern fac- tories and mo re convenient infrastructure. Th e price of labor in the rich countries is high. The average c ost of an hour of someone’s time in the United States—including social charges—is $20.73. The average cost of someone’s time in China, on the other hand, is som ewh ere between 13.5 and 65 cents, depending on the source. As long as capital, expertise, and f inished products are free to move around, it is likely that the two numbers will grow closer together. The consumer doesn’t par- ticularly care who assembled his gadget; he only cares that he can buy it at the lowest possible price. L abor is a big component of the price of most thi ngs, so both manufacturers and consumers appreciate lower l abor prices. Our old incompetent enemies have learned how to compete. We w e r e t o ld that America became much richer because of Reagan’s improvements, but if that is so, why did real wage rates not rise? A man sweats, humps, busses, totes, and schleps today, on average, for about the same wa ge he got before the Reagan revolution f ired its f irst shot. But that is not to say that everything is just the same. Far from it. Today, people own less of their own homes— homeowner equity (the portion not mortgaged ) has fallen from nearly 70 percent in the late 1970s to less than 55 percent in 2005. Plus, the average person owes more money to more peop le than ever befo re. Household debt in the fall of 2005 is 113 percent of annual income on average; prior to 1980, it was 58 percent. Today, fewer people have se- cure sources of money for their retirement. More than two-thirds of older hou seholds—those headed by people 47 to 64—had someone earning a pension in 1983. By 2001, fewer than half did. The Reagan Era came with a relatively new idea, that people should be responsible fo r their own pensions. Companies stopped offering f ixed- ben efit pension plans. But by 2000, old people were feeling the effects. They were not as well off as they had expected to be. When the holdings"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Reagan’s Legacy 213 of typical households were analyzed, today’s near-retirees turned out to be a little poorer, in constant dollars, than the previous generation was when it approached retirement in 1983. Edwa rd Wolff, an economist at New York University, looked at 18 years of household f inancial data from the Fed. Somehow he retained his sanity long enough to discover that the net worth of the average older household declined by 2.2 percent, or $4,000, during the period [1983–2001] to $199,900. We look on that fact in shock and awe. How could it be that after the biggest explosion of we alth-creation in the history of man, the average man is not richer, but poorer? We rec all the Carter years: The nation was at peace. Despite inf lation, Americans were still getting richer. Wages were rising. The country still enjoyed a positive balance of trade, and the r est of the world still owed it more th an it owed to foreigners. But in 1980, stocks had been going down for 14 years and bonds had been in a bear market that began in 1945. With eyes in the back of their heads, people must have looked out and seen nothing but trouble. The Vietnam War was still in the near background. And Richard Nixon. And Jimmy Carter himself. Americans were discouraged, we are told; they had lost conf idence in themselves. Then, along came Ronald Reagan with a message of hope, optimism, and som ething-for-nothing. The supply side, the Laffer Curve! Suddenly it seemed possible to spend more ...and still have more! Government could cut taxes—and get more revenue, said Laffer. Forget the def icit; it will take care of itse lf. Some how. The average man f igured he could do the same: bor row more, spend more, and he would get rich. Pensions were out. Free people could look out for themselves. They could set up their own 401( k) plans and make money in common stocks. All you had to do was buy the companies you liked, said Peter Lynch. And the companies themselves no longer had to worry about their emp loye es. Managers could focus on cooking the books to give the im- pression of maximizing shareholder value. America soon became “Share- holder Natio n”—a whole country of capitalists, all getting rich in the freest, most dynamic economy the world had ever seen. Now we see that the whole thing w as a huge swindle. Supply-side policies never real ly increased the supply side.

Employ- ees never quite got around to putting money into their 401( k) plans; they we re too busy trying to keep up with the credit card bills. And managers soon realized that maxi mizing their o wn incomes with stock options, bonuses, and rich retirement plans was more rewa rding than looking out for shareholders. The shareholders themselves—the millions of lumpen p seudo- investors who owned mutual funds—couldn’t tell the difference. They had neither the time, the money, nor the tr aining to be real capitalists; they were merely chumps for Wall Street. And now, here we are, a quarter-century since Reagan won the White House: We are at war, with the biggest trade def icit, the biggest federal debt, the biggest f inancing gap, the lowest interest rates in 45 years, and the most consumer debt ever. In real terms, the average man earns less per hour worked tha nhedidintheCarteryears. And the typical house- hol da pproa ches retirement poorer than it would have been in 1980. America was the world’s biggest creditor when Ike was presi dent. By Ro nald Reagan’s second term, about 15 years into the pax dollarium era, the nation slipped to net-debtor status. In the following 15 years, it broke all records—becoming the world’s biggest debtor and the greatest debtor of al l time. But Thomas Gale Moore, then a member of President Reagan’s Council of Economic Advisors, must have anticipated Ben Bernanke when he noticed the United States crossing the creditor/debtor threshold in the mid-1980s. No t to worry, said he, “We can pay off anybody by running a press.” In 1980, people still held parties when they paid off their mortgages. Paul Volcker said that he would bring down inf lation rates, and he meant it. You could buy a stock for six times earnings and lend your money to the U.S. government for a 15 percent yield. Lenders demanded that much bec ause they remembered the inf lation of the 1970s. They knew that not every investment story had a happy ending. Back then, the United States still made things. General Motors was our biggest employer; you could tell what year a car was made by looking at the tail fins, they got better every year.

Now, they’re ov er 78 percent. And they are growing rapidly. SUNRISE, SUNSET Un der Ronald Reagan, Americans thought they had rediscovered their you th. Th ey cou ldn’t remember ever feeling more conf ident or more op- timistic. Then, 12 years later, in George W. Bush, Republicans thought they saw their hero reincarnate, with another 20 years of prosperity ahead. And why shouldn’t it be morning in America again? We a n s w er the question directly. It is not morning in America because it is evening. There is no bull market because there is a bear market. Peo- ple are not getting richer because they are getting poorer. It is not 1981 bec ause it is 2005. Re ade rs wh o f ind this an unsatisfying explanation are reminded that it is not your authors who set the planets in motion around the sun and created man—such as he is—out of the dust of the earth. Morning often loo ks a lot like evening—if you face the wrong way at the right time. But it is the opposite end of the day’s cycle. In 1982, interest rates were high and stock prices were low. In 1982, there were a few people who wanted to buy stocks, and many who didn’t. In 1982, America, Inc., looked like a has- been economy. Its currency was widely considered near-trash and its bonds were described as “certif icates of guaranteed conf iscation.” Yo u could buy nearly the entire Dow for just one ounce of gold. Now it takes 22 ounces. The trend of the time, in 1982, was down. Then, as now, smart p eople considered it eternal. BusinessWeek proclaimed that equities were not just in a cyclical downturn, not just sick, but dead. As the moon looked down in the summer of 1982, it s hone on a wall of wo rry so high that only a knucklehe aded contrarian would th ink of climbing it. Every headline seemed to give another reason the bear market wo uld last forever. Every poll showed that consumers expected it. Every"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"216 EV ENING IN AMERICA price seemed to conf irm the everlasting trend; the sun had set forever; the black of nig ht was permanent. And yet, at that very moment, had an investor turned around, he wo uld have noticed a brightening in the eastern sky. Over the next 18 years, the sun rose higher and higher, until investors were so encouraged by the favorable growing conditions that they scattered their seed like confetti at a parade. Did anyone doubt that it would take root in the hard conc rete of lower Manhattan’s f inancial hothouse or the thin soils of the technology sector? But the year 2005 is ever ything the year 1982 was not. Today, there are many people who want to buy stocks and few who don’t. Interest rates are nearly as low as they have been in half a century and stocks are as high as they have ever been. Consumers—who were relatively reluctant to spend in 1982—pick their own pockets today. The latest f igures—from April 2005—show consumer spending increasing at f ive times the increase in wages and s alaries. And housing is booming. In many parts of California, prices of houses are going up 10 times faster than the rate of core inf lation. Can these sunny trends continue forever? They never have before. And no theory of economics explains how they might. Instead, the typical pattern is for night to follow day. It is also typical for the dumb things people did when they were feeling f lus h to be corrected by recession and bear markets. There is one more big difference. In the hot sun of the Reagan recov- ery, overseas investors, who had previously been cool on Ameri ca, warmed up. Now , we start from a very different position. Foreigners have been hot for U.S. assets for years—an attitude we have come to count on, because we n eed $2 billion in capital inf lows every day to cover our foreign-trade deficit. What happens as they cool off again? Of course, they will cool off. Americans cannot expect foreigners to support them indef initely. Someday, perhaps soon, they will realize that theirm ain customers cannot pay their debts; they will get tired of lend- ing t othem. Then, the long, dark night will begin. It will not last forever. In our previous book, we foresaw a “long, slow, soft slump” coming. But just as every sunny day com es to an end sometime, so does even the darkest night. If Americans keep their wits about them, they can hope to get through it and begin another sunny period bright and refreshed."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Reagan’s Legacy 217 A WORLD OF DEBT Pe te Pe terson attempted to gauge the diff iculty of determ ining the burden we’ve now placed on future generations. “Estimates vary,” Pete Peterson points out in Running On Empty, his vast inquiry into the impending bankruptcy of the U.S. government, “depending on methodology, but the numbers are all vast.” Peterson points to studies done on the future obli- gations of the Social Security and Medicare trust fund alone. In 2003, the American Enterprise Institute projected a $45 trillion shortfall; $47 tril- lion countered the International Monetary Fund in 2004; the National Center for Policy Analysis and the Brookings Institution came up with $50 trillion and $60 trillion, respectively, in their own research reports pub lished in 2003. Those are all incomprehensibly large numbers, of course, but the biggest of the projections came in 2004 from Social Security and Me dicare trustees themselves. They estimated the unfunded benef it liabil- ities to have a current value of $74 trillion dollars. As an empire matur es, the imperial citizens believe more and more extravagant things. By the opening of the twenty-f irst century, Americans were sp ending more than they earned. Each day brought more new debt than real new wealth. Yet, between 2002 and 2005, every quarter showed grow th in GDP. Americans mistook this growth for progress. They knew they had the world’s best economy, its best system of government, and its finest culture. They could not imagine that they were growing poorer. But here we turn again to the living and the dead for elucidation. Supply- sider Jude Wanniski admits that real growth has come alm ost to a halt: In the United States, my own work shows that between 1945 and 1971, wh en the dollar was f ixed to gold at $35 oz under the 1944 Bretton Wo o d s a r r a n g ement, the real economy in the US grew by 4 percent per year. From 1971 when the dollar was f loated to 2004, real growth of the US economy has only a pitiful 0.3 percent per year. 7 The growth, such as it is, in the American economy, has come about by virtue of increased emphasis on the present tense. Americans came to despise the past and neglect the future. The lessons of the dead and the de- sires of the unborn were both ignored.

It is the largest edif ice of debt ever put up. It sustains the most magnif icent world economy ever assembled. It supports more people in better style than any system ever before devised. No tonly is it incomparably effective, it is also immeasurably entertain- ing. For it has its burnished helmets and flying banners; its intellectuals and its gladiators; its Caesars, Antonys, Neros, and Caligulas. It has its temples, its forum, its Capitol, its senators; its praetorian guards; its via Appia; its proconsuls, centurions, and legions all over the world as well as its bread and its circuses in the homeland, and its costly wars in periphery ar eas. The Roman Empire rested on a classical model of imperial f inance. Ben eath a complex and nuanced pyramid of relationships was a founda- tion of tribute formed wi th the hard r ock o fbr ute force.

Instead, he urges her to speculate on the most bubbly prop- erty market in American history. Naturally, she went for it, a ided no doubt by a whole industry of professional dissemblers. Press reports tell us that appraisers routinely stretch valuations to help close a deal. Mortgage len ders know perfectly well the appraisals are lies, but they wink at them with one eye while winking at the borrower’s phony income declaration with the other. Again, according to the press reports, lenders no longer verify income claims. They have gone blind! In California, house prices have raced so far ahead of incomes that barely one in ten buyers can afford the median house. Yet thanks to “cre- ative f inance,” more houses are being sold than ever before. Thus the foundation of the debt pyramid is laid down in a bed of mu- tual deceit and cupidity, and covered with another level of fabrications. Lenders do not stick around to see how the loans work out. Instead, they pretend the credits are good, and package the mortgages into conven ient units so that investors can buy them. The f inanciers know damned well that many buyers can’t really afford to pay for the houses they buy, but they see no point in mentioning it. Nor do the investors want to know. They’re in on the scam, too. The smartest of them even have f igured out how it works: The Fed holds down short-term rates below the inf lation rate so that investors in long-term mortgage f inancing and buyers of U.S. Tr easury obligations can make an easy prof it.

It is growing. It is stable. Economists, commentators, and policymakers take up these distor- tions and add their own twists. It is obvious to anyone who bothers to think about it that an economy that spends more than it earns is in decline. But try to f ind an economist willing to say so! They’ve all become like rich notables in the time of Trajan, doing the emperor’s work whether they are on his payr oll or no t. They will tell you the economy is expand- ing, but it is an expansion similar to what happens when a compulsive eater escapes from a fat farm.

On the issue of the trade def icit, they will say what the senators and consuls want to hear, as Levey and Brown did in Foreign Affairs maga- zine: “The United States’ current account def icit and foreign debt are not dire threats to its global position, as would-be Cassandras warn. U.S. pow er is f irmly grounded on economic superiority and f inancial stability that will not end soon.” 1 In fact, the story of international trade, circa 2005, is the most preposterous tale economists have ever heard. One na- tion buys things that it cannot afford and doesn’t need with money it doesn’t have. Another sells on credit to people who already cannot pay and then builds more factories to increase output.

On the one side of the globe —in the Anglo-Saxon countries in gen- eral, but the United States in particular—are the consumers. On the other side—principally in Asia—are the producers. One side makes, the other takes. One saves, the other borrows. One produces, the other consumes. This is not the way it was meant to be. When America f irst stooped to Empire, she was a rising, robust, energetic, innovative young economy. And for the f irst six decades of her imperium—roughly from 1913 until 1977—she prof ited from her competitive position. Every country to wh ich she was able to extend her pax dollarum became a customer. Her businesses made a prof it. Bu tgradually, her commercial advantage f aded and her in dustries aged. The very process of spreading the so ft warmth of her protect ion ove rthe earth s eemed to make it more fertile. Tough, weedy competitors sprouted alloverthe peripheryo fthe empire—f irst in Europe, then in Japan, and later, throughout Asia, even areas she had never been able to dom inate. By the early twenty-f irst century, the costs of maintaining her role as the world’s only superpower, and its only imperial power, had risen in ex- cess of 5 percent of her GDP, or $558 billion per year. Not only had she nev er f igured out a good way to charge for providing the world with order, now order was wo rking against her. The periphery economies grew faster. They had newer and better industries. They had higher savings lev- els and much lower labor r ates. They had few of the costs of bread or cir- cus es and none of the costs of policing the empire. They were freer, lighter, faster. Every day, the competitors took more of America’s busi- ness, assets, and money. If the empire were an operating busin ess, account- ants would say it was losing money. Th e empire no lon ger pays because the entire Western world—in- cluding Japan—has lost its competitive edge. G lobalization of the pax dollarum era served the United States well after World War II. America was the world’s leading exporter. But Europe also thrived in the 30 years after the war— les trente glorieuses, as the French call them.

Wh at is left for the developed economi es? What could they do? Here is wh ere European and Anglo-Saxon economies part company. The Euro- peans emp hasize high value-added products such as luxury goods and pre- cision tools. They cling rigidly to the wisdom of the old economists, refusing to expand consumer credit and refusing to use massive doses of fiscal stimuli to increase overall demand. House prices rise sharply in Paris, Ma drid, and Rome. But there have been few signs of speculation. Ho uses are not ref inanced readily. They are not “f lipped.” There is little creative f inance. Nor has there been a big r un-up in consumer debt, or a big run-down in savings rates. Credit cards are still comparatively rare. Un emp loym ent is high, for Europe’s policy managers have tolerated nei- ther marginal jobs nor marginal credits. Europe is rigid and dull, econom- ically, but relatively solid, with a positive balance of trade. The Anglo-Saxon countries took a diffe rent ro ute. During a time wh en the Bank of England has regularly moved interest rates up and down to deal with changes in economic condition s, the ECB sat on its hands. The general consensus was that Europe would be better off if it acted a bit more like the Anglo-Saxons, by manipulating interest rates to en- courage consumer debt.

The numbers were frauds. If you were to look at the percentages fairly, the European economy actually looked no worse than its Anglo- Saxon competitor—with a similar rate of growth, higher unemployment, but better productivity and less debt. As the Anglo-Saxon economies lost their competitive edge in manu- factur ing, they tried to make up for it by encouraging consumption. This is the biggest fraud of all. At f irst, higher consumption feels good. It is like bur ning the furniture to keep warm; it feels good for a moment. But the sense of well-being is extremely short-lived. When people borrow and spend, they feel as though they are getting richer—especially when their houses are rising in price. The increased consumption even shows up, in- directly, in the GDP f igures as growth. But you don’t really become we althier by consuming. You become wealthier by making things you can sell to others—at a prof it. The point is obvious but, at this stage of impe- rial f inance, it was inconven ient. The homeland’s losses—measured by a negative balance of trade— began in the mid-1970s. Less than 30 years later, both government and consumers were running up debts at an alarming rate. What else could they do? The only way Americans could continue their imperial role—which meant more to them than ever, since it was now the only source of national pride left to them—was to borrow (see Figures 10.1 and 10.2). Th e global economic system in the pax dollarium era was perfectly balanced. For every credit in Asia, there was an equal and opposite debit in the United States. And for every dollar’s worth of demand from the United States, there was a dollar’s worth of supply already waiting in a cont ainer in Hong Kong.

When one foreign loan comes due, other foreigners practically line up to ref inance it; it is as if they were drinks to a street bum, just to gawk and wonder when he might pass out. HOW THE PUBLIC DEBT INCREASED “Since Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole’s introduction of the funding system in England during the 1720s,” writes H. A. Scott Trask for the Mises Institute, “the secret was out that government debt need never be repaid....Walpol e’s system proved its worth in f inancing British overseas expansion and imperial wars in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The government could now maintain a huge peacetime naval and military establishm ent, readily fund new wars, and need not retrench afterward. The British Empire was built on more than the blood of its soldiers and sailors; it was built on debt.” 2 The new system was slow to catch on in America. Jefferson was against it. In 1789, in a letter to James Madison, he wondered whether “one generation of men has a right to bind another.” His answer was “no.” “The earth belongs in usufruct to the living,” he conc luded. “No generation can contract debts greater than may be paid during the course of its own existence.” 3 An intergenerational debt is an odd thing. Say a man buys a house. He may leav e the house to his children, with a mortgage owing. The children we re not party to the mortgage contract, but they take the bequ est in good grace. The house may have a mortgage or it may need a new roof. A gift is a gift, encumbered or not. If it is too heavily burdened with debt, they could simply turn it down; they never made a deal with the mortgage company an d are under no obligation to pay it."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"America’s Glorious Empire of Debt 227 Suppo se it is credit card debt. Say the man used the money to take a trip around the world. But the trip wore him out; no sooner does he re- turn home than he collapses of a heart attack. Are the children under any obligation to pay the credit card bills? Not at all. But comes now, “public” debt. What kind of strange beast is this? One generation consumes. It then hands the next generation the bill. The you nger generation never agreed to the terms of the indebtedness. They are party to a contract—and on the wrong end of it, we might add—that they never made. Indentured servants o nly had to work seven years to pay off their indenture. This new generation, on the other hand, will have to wo rk their entire lives. Such arrangem ent s are often excused as part of the “social contract.” But what kind of contract allows one person to take the benef its while sticking the costs to someone else? But dead men don’t talk, and the unborn don’t vote. Politicians in America—just as those in Britain, Italy, and Germany—gradually came to see that they could get the benef its of spending money in the present, wh ile passing on the debts to the next administration and the next gener- ation. Then, as now, war provided cover for excess spending. First, there we re the debts from the American Revolution, which were paid down quickly. Then came the War of 1812, Mexican War, and the War between the States. Each time, spending was increased, debts were taken on, and then, after the war, the debt was paid down, or paid off completely. Wo rld War I saw federal debt explode from $3 billion to $26 billion. Presidents Ha rding and Hoover paid it down to $16 billion. But then came the Great Depression, Roosevelt, and World War II. By 1945, fed- eral debt had reached $260 billion. Then came som ething new. The war did not end. It continued as the Cold War, and instead of the debt being paid down, it was increased. Un der Ronald Reagan, America’s debt seemed on course for Mars. Less than $1 trillion in 1980, it soared to $2.7 trillion before Reagan left office. One might have expected some relief after the Cold War was over. But the habit of debt is hard to break. By the time George W. Bush took office, the debt had risen to $5.7 trillion. Mr. Bush, a conservative, might have seized the opportunity to pay down the debt. The nation was at peace and expected huge budget sur- pluses. He promised as much when he stood before a joint session of Con- gress in 2001 and announced his budget."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"228 EV ENING IN AMERICA Figure 10.3 U.S. Consumer Credit Ou tstanding and Av erage U.S. Credit Card Debt per Houshold Source: Federal Reserve. $9,000 $8,000 $7,000 $6,000 $5,000 $4,000 $3,000 $2,000 $1,000 $0 Home Mortgages Outstanding 1952 1955 1958 1961 1964 1967 1970 1973 1976 1979 1982 1985 1988 1991 1994 1997 2000 2003 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 $8,000 $7,000 $6,000 $5,000 $4,000 $3,000 $2,000 $1,000 $ U.S. Consumer Credit Outstanding per Capita"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"America’s Glorious Empire of Debt 229 Figure 10.4 Individual Loans at Commercial Banks and Commercial and Industrial Loans at All Commercial Banks As the empire matured, Americans embraced new id eas and attitudes.

The Fed chairman journeyed to Fife Co llege, in Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland, where Smith was born in 1723. There, he commented on Smith’s work: “Most of Smith’s free market par- adigm remains applicable to this day,” said he. 5 In particular, the world seems to have discovered that independent buy- ers and sellers are better at delivering the goods than government planners. Th is would have come as a shock to George Orwell. Writing at the beginning of World War II, Orwell expressed the belief of millions: “I began this book to the tune of German bombs. ...What this war has demon strated is that private capitalism—that is, an economic system in wh ich land, factories, mines and transports are owned privately and oper- ated solely for prof it—does not work. It cannot deliver the goods.” 6 Orwell was wrong. Capit alism delive red the goods better than social- ism,afactthatevennearsightedjournalistsandcentralbankerswere eventually able to see. But even after the fall o ftheBerlinWall,contin- uedA me rica’s most celebrated central banker, there was “no eulogy for cent ralplanning.” Adam Smith had proposed a useful metaphor to help explain how a system of private, individual decision making—which must have looked chaotic to a top-down observer—actually functioned to the betterment of all. A rise in the price of pigs, for example, sends a signal to the hog raiserstop roduce mo re. Thus, the market is guided by an “inv isible hand” to produce exactly as much of a thing as people really want and can really afford. Quick-witted readers will already be gurgling with indignation. Mar- kets wo rk best without the heavy hand of regulation, Greenspan acknowl- edged. But he seemed to exempt, conveniently, the cre dit markets. The maestro’s speech hit a false note; rather like Presi dent Bush’s approach to evangelical democracy, it seemed to miss the point. In stead of letting len ders of credit and demanders of it be gu ided by an “inv isible hand,” for years th e Fed chief ’s boney paws have drawn them together. Mr. Green span’s “Open Market Committee,” not the open market, has largely determined the rate at which lenders will lend, short term, and at which borrowers will borrow. Why is it that what is good for the goose of lumber markets, stock mar kets, grain markets, laptop computer markets, and almost every other"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"America’s Glorious Empire of Debt 235 mar ket under Heaven is not good enough for the gander of the credit mar- ket? The answer is not one of logic, but of convenience. Most of the time, pol itical leaders prefer easier credit terms than buyers and sellers would determine on their own. In setting its key rate, the Open Market Com- mittee is like ly to set a rate that is to the politicians’ liking. Ne w Yorker columni st James Surowiecki’s book, The Wisdom of Crowds, 7 ma kes the point that two heads are better than one. Groups of peop le can be smarter than individuals. A market, theoretically, can do a better job of f inding the right price for a thing. A market is supposed to aggregate the private opinions and indepen dent judgments of thousands of individuals. Generally it succeeds. But on occasion, the market slips into crowd-like behavior—whipped to excess by the f inancial media or the f i- nancial industry. And sometimes, the whole market is deceived by its own central plan- ner s. Rather than allow lenders and bor rowers to dec ide for themselves wh at rates they would accept, the central planners at the U.S. Federal Re- serve decided for them. How they can know exactly what lending rate such a large and inf initely complex economy needs has never been ex- plained. But, historically, from the Fed’s lowest rate to its highest, there are about 1200 basis points. On those odds alone, they have almost cer- tainly chosen the wrong one. There are times—in deed m ost of the time— wh en pol itical leaders prefer easier credit terms than buyers and sellers determine on their own. In setting its key rate, the Open Market Com- mittee tends to set a rate much more to the politicians’ liking than the one offered by Mr. Market. A lower rate, that is. But as Schumpeter points out, any stimulus in excess of actual savings is a fraud. Th is artificially low rate gives the illusion that there is more money available than there really is. Hardly anyone ever complains. Consumers feel they have more money to spend than they really have. Producers sense a demand that really isn’t there. Undeserving politicians get reelected. An d conniving central bankers are reappointed. The “information content” of the Fed’s low rate misleads ever yone. They proceed happily on the long, slow process of ruining themselves, un- aware that they are responding to an imposter. Only much later does the deception become a problem. Friedr ich Hayek explains: The continuous injection of additional amounts of money at point s of the economic system where it creates a temporary demand, which must"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"236 EV ENING IN AMERICA cease when the increase of money stops or slows down, together with the expectation of a continuing rise in prices, draws l abor and other re- sources into employments which can last only so long as the increase of the quantity of money continues at the same rate—or perhaps even only so long as it continues to accelerate at a given rate ...would rap- idly lead to a disorganization of all economic activity. 8 The way it works is simple: An economy is geared to produce for real demand. Or it is misled by artif icially low interest rates to produce for a level of dem and that doesn’t exist. The deceit can go on for a long time. But, event ually, some form of adjustment must take place—usually a recession restores order by reducing both production and consumption. Generally, the correction is equal to the deception that preceded it. But the Bank of Alan Greenspan thinks it can avoid these periodic bouts of sanity. Fed Governor Ben Bernanke proposed “g lobal cooperation” in a November 21, 2002, speech. Then, in May 2003, he went to Japan urg- ing concerted action. The Fed was prepared to sacrif ice the solvency of American consumers, he told the Japanese. Tax cuts and low interest rates could still induce them to buy things they didn’t need with money they didn’t have. But Japan had to help hold down U.S. interest rates—by buy- ing up dollars and dollar-denominated assets, notably U.S. Treasury bonds. This is what happened next, according to Richard Duncan: “In 2003, and the f irst quarter of 2004, Japan carried out a remarkable experiment in mon etary poli cy— remarkable in the impact it had on the global economy and equ ally remarkable in that it went almost entirely unnoticed in the f inancial press. Over those 15 months, mon eta ry authorities in Japan created ¥35 tril- lion. To put that into perspective, ¥35 trillion is approximately 1 percent of the world’s annual economic output. It is roughly the size of Japan’s annual tax revenue base or nearly as large as the loan book of UFJ, one of Japan’s four largest banks. ¥35 trillion amounts to the equiva lent of $2,500 for every per son in Japan and, in fact, would amount to $50 per person if distributed equally among the entire population of the planet. In short, it was money creat ion on a sca le never before attempted during peacetime.” 9 Why did the Japanese create so much mon ey? Because they n eeded to buy from their citizens the dollars they had accumulated by selling things to Americans. Had they not done so their currency would have gone up—making their products less competitive on the U.S. market."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"America’s Glorious Empire of Debt 237 Had they not done so, the dollar would have fallen much further against other currencies. Had they not done so, the Japanese would not have had the dollars to buy U.S. Treasury bonds. And had they not bought so ma ny of them, U.S. interest rates would have risen, consumers would have had less mon ey to spend, and probably the whole world would have had an econom ic crisis. “Intentionally or otherwise,” Duncan continues, “by creating and lending the equivalent of $320 billion to the United States, the Bank of Japan and the Japanese Ministry of Finance counteracted a private sector run on the dollar and, at the same time, f inanced the U.S. tax cuts that re- flate d the global economy, all this while holding U .S. long bond yields down near historically low levels. “In 2004, the g lobal economy grew at the f astest rate in 30 years. Mon ey creation by the Bank of Japan on an unprec edented scale was per- haps the most important factor responsible for that growth. In fact, ¥35 trillion cou ld have made the difference between global ref lation and global def lation. How odd that it went unnoticed.” 10 FLIGHT TO HAZARD As the empire matured, Americans developed new id eas and attitudes to go with it. We have already shown how they took on the beliefs of an im- perial race, ready to mind everyone’s business but their own. Financially, their beliefs changed, too; people switched th eir attention from assets to cash f low, from balance sheets to monthly operating statements, from long-term wealth-building to paycheck-to-paycheck f inancing, from sav- ing to spending, and from “just in case” to “just in time.” It was a f ligh ttohazardthatbecamemorehazardouswithevery tak eoff and landing. It was as if a strange new trade wind had been stirred up in the Pa- cif ic and blew across the country. Year after year, it blew stronger, until practically every tree and street sign, all across the country, leaned toward empire. Gradually, all of America’s institutions and attitudes were bent by the new wind. The federal government ran a fairly tight ship until the Johnson and Re agan years, and then the wind caught it. Soon, it was under full sail, flying toward record def icits and unheard-of debts."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"238 EV ENING IN AMERICA Th e Federal Reserve braced itself under the iron hand of Paul Volcker (1981–1987). Then, it was Alan Greenspan’s turn at the helm. Soon, the Fed was not only bent over along with ever yone else, but actually f lapping away itself—increasing the blow. Con sumers had a hard time keeping their feet on the ground. Every time they ventured outdoors, the strong wind pushed them toward more and more dangerous debt. Where once they considered a heavy mortgage a risky thing, they came to see it as no risk at all. The gush of air picked up their houses and lightened the load. As interest rates dropped, they couldn’t wait to ref inance and then ref inance again, each time “taking out ” a little more equity. Th e wind bent consumers’ attitudes toward debt and twisted the lend- ing industry into such comely new for ms: How could they resist? In the spring of 2005, Gr ant’s Interest Rate Observer paused to ob- serve som ething un usual: Rarer even than a banker with a heart, it had discovered one with a brain. Mr. Vernon W. Hill is a banker from a small town that must be in a gully; the winds of modern debt-f inancing didn’t seem to reach it. “We f eel the U.S. is in trou ble, with major weakne sses and unpleas- antness ahead ,” he says. “Whether inf lation or def lation lies ahead, or some kind of both, we believe many borrowers will be unable to repay their loans as sch eduled.” None of the reasons Mr. Hill mentions are original: little savings, little investment in productive industry (much of wha tisinvested goes into short-lived software), and the illusion of we alth that accompanies rising house prices. With little real investment in new factories or new methods of production, few good-paying new jobs are created. In such an economy, a banker without a brain walks lightly and lends heavily. For the president of Monroe County Bank, on theo ther hand, you get the impression that every step toward a new loan is uphill.H elends almost reluctantly, wondering how borrowers will be able to repay. While other bankers were moving more and more of their money into real estate loans, Mr. Hill was warily reducing his bank’s exposure—espe- cially to residential property. Home mortga ges were less than a third of commercial bank loans in 1980. Now they are nearly two-thirds. Other bank ers will len d to anyone who can sign his name, provided he is buying a house. Mr. Hill wants to know how the borrower will be able to pay"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"America’s Glorious Empire of Debt 239 bac k his loan if—heaven forfend—his house doesn’t go up in price by 20 percent this year. These were not the sort of practices that would make Mr. Hill’s estab- lishment the “Bank of the Year” or get his photo on the cover of Busi- nessWeek. No t in the year 2005. His is not the Bank of the Pre sent. It may be the Bank of the Past. That it may also be the Bank of the Future is the guess that keeps us going. No t only is the Monroe County Bank out of step with most of today’s len ding institutions, it seems to be marching in the opposite direction— back to the future. We have never met the man or visited his off ice in Forsyth, Georgia. But were we to en ter the bank, we would expect to find a man behind an old-fashioned ledger at an oak desk ...and a spit- toon in the corner. Were we to ask for a loan, we would expect a disap- proving look, followed by a polite, but severe inquiry into our personal f inances. No, these are not the methods of the typical banker in the eigh- teenth year of Alan Greenspan’s reign at the Federal Reserve S ystem. No r is Mr. Hill’s approach to the credit industry particularly prof- itable. He admits he would earn more money by doing what other bankers do. Most bankers borrow short and lend long. As long as long rates are higher than short rates—and he does his math right—he will make money. Mr. Hill’s approach, borrowing long and lending short, is a cu- riosity in the banking industry. It forgoes current prof its, in favor of a mo re solid balance sheet. And when long rates rise, which they will do, sooner or later—both Mr. Hill and your authors are sure of it—Mr. Hill will have the last l aug h. Compared with most bankers, it will be far easier for h im to collect his credits and pay his liabilities. Stocks are bu oyed up or thrown down as the market’s view of the firm ’s value changes. Prof it-making enterprises’ value depends on how much prof it th ey make, a f igure subject to both change and speculation. But the value of a house changes little over time. Year after year, it is the same roof, the same walls, the same cozy warmth and convenience. The value that an owner-occupied house gives cannot be amended, jiggled, ben t, written down, cooked up, or restated. No clever CFO can smooth its earnings. No fast-talking promoter can hype up next year’s sales. It is wh at it appears to be and nothing more: home sweet home. But with the complicity of the entire credit industry, except for one bank in Forsyth, Georgia, Americans have come to believe that the very same dull and lifeless bricks they know so well—along with the fading"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"240 EV ENING IN AMERICA paint, the stained carpets, the leaking taps, and cracking driveways—have a near-magical quality; they can make them rich. They believe that the house is an “investment,” diffe rent from stocks o nly in that it is safer and mo re prof itable. They know from their own, direct experience that the house is not a prof it center, but a cost center. Each month, the place must be maintained. Money must be spent on it. They also know that—other than the aforementioned service th e house renders to its occupants— there is no output. There is nothing that comes out the back door that can be sold. As a business, it is a losing proposition, and they know it. It pro- duces nothing; no revenues are realized. No prof its are earned. An d yet, the homeowner also believes that he can go to friendly lenders from time to time and “take out” cash—as if the place had been accumulating earnings. What he is taking out, he believes, is merely sur- plus equity. He f igures that if last year he had, say, $200,000 worth of hou se, this year he must have $250,000 worth of house. He can “take out” the $50,000 extra and spend it—just as if the house had earned $50,000 in prof it—and still have his $200,000 worth of house. He does not ask himself where that $50,000 came from. He does not find it at all extraordinary that an item he knows to be a cost center could also produce more in “prof its” each year than he earns in income! Nor does he wonder how there could be so much untapped value locked up in his house, wh en he k nows full well that he and his family use every room. Mr. Vernon W. Hill considers this wealth an illusion, as we do. He believes it will lead to big problems among both borrowers and lenders. To av oid th e big problems personally, Mr. Hill, like Warren Buffett, lives in the same house he bought nearly 40 years ago. Mr . Hill requires p rospective borrowers to show him their f inances without considering the house they live in. Whatever value there is in the lived-in house, he says, is “inactive.” It doesn’t really earn any money for you; if you were to sell it, you would just have to buy another one. And you can’t ship it to China to pay for your f lat-screen TVs or to Japan to pay for your SUV. It was not that Mr. Hill was necessarily opposed to the great empire; he just didn’t seem to care. But a view more typical of the average lender, and average economist, was expressed by a pair of economists, mentioned brief ly earlier, writing in the International Herald Tribune. Mr. David H. Levey was formerly managing director of Moody’s Sovereign Ratings Servic e. Stuart S. Brown is a professor of economics and international re-"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"America’s Glorious Empire of Debt 241 lations at Syracuse University. The two argued that “U.S. Hege mony Has a Strong Foundation.” The two are talking big. They are talking macro- econom ics, with no trace of Mr. Hill’s modest insights, or his private knowle dge, or his 37 years of experience lending money, or the keen and immediate attention of having his own money at stake. What Levey and Brown were trying to tell us is that we have nothing to worry about. Yes, it is true that we Americans spend 6 percent more every day than we earn. Yes, $11.5 trillion worth of U.S. assets are in for- eign hands an d our net international investment position has gone nega- tive at more than 3 trillion. And yes, it is true that we save nearly nothing. But we can still feel good about ourselves, they say. The numbers obscure “the United States’ institutional, technological and demographic advantages,” they say. What are those advantages? The two never quite said. But what could they say? Other countries have different institutions. Others have different demographics. Others use different technologi es. Who knows which are an advantage and which are a hindrance? You only know—and then, only by inference—after the fact. At the height of its bubble in 1989, it was widely presumed that Japan had all the advantages. Hardly a single issue of the business press failed to mention them. Now, 15 years and a major slump later, Japan seems to have all the disadvantages, while the advantages somehow crossed the Bering Strait into North America. Tod ay, the mainstream press tells us how dynamic, f lexible, and open the U.S. economy is. At the end of their article, Messrs. Levey and Brown told us that the only real threat is that “protectionism and isolationism at home will put an end to the dynami sm, openness and f lexibility that pow er the U.S.” 11 We can’t help but remember French military policy after the Franco- Prussian War. Led by Colonel Grandmaison, the French allowed words to replace tactics and strategy. Élan was the word. It meant “spirit” or “force of will.” When World War I began, the French attacked on horse- bac k, swords glittering. What élan! What style! What blockheads. The German machine guns opened up and soon the ground was covered by handsome young soldiers. Élan proved great for poets but bad for France’s military.

So what if the Chinese and Japanese sell our bonds, we still have our houses! Th e two economists note that “when you include capital gains, 401( k) retirement plans, and home valu es, U.S. domestic saving is around 20 per- cent of GDP, the same as in most other dev eloped nations.” 12 Th ey should talk to Mr. Hill. They don’t seem to realize that home values are “inactive.” We have yet to hear of a factory built with increases in house prices. We have yet to see a debt paid from a rising house price— witho ut an equal debt arising som ewhere else. “Much of our meager savings and massive borrowing has gone into hou sing,” says the Monroe County banker. “How convenient it would be now if mansio ns an d subdivisions could be exported, to improve our for- eign trade balance. Since they cannot be exported, perhaps the foreigners wh o own our massive debts can be repaid by coming to live in our Mc- Man sions, with homeowners serving as hou seboys and house maids to the visiting Japanese and Chinese owners of our debt.” The United States economy is growing, says Paul Volcker, “on the savings of poor people.” Or, as Marshall Auerback puts it, we have be- come a “B lanche Dubois” economy—we have delusions of grandeur, and yet, we are completely dependent on the kindn ess of strangers just to keep going. Poor people make things, and then f inance the consumption of them by r ich people. Americans deceive themselves with the fanciful notion that people wh o live in hovels, eat disgusting animals, and earn less than 1 ⁄ 20 as much per hour will be willing to f inance our new houses and new wars forever.

There was a time when thrift was a virtue. “A penny saved is a penny earned,” dead people whisper. Accountants with sharp pencils even no- ticed th at a penny saved was more than a penny earned, 40 to 50 percent mo re; it was not subject to state, local, and federal income taxes. But in America, circa 2005, thrift came to be regarded no longer as a virtue, b ut as a mental disorder. Evidence came from a magazine spotted on Long Island, again through the ever-observant Gr ant’s Interest Rate Observer. The publica- tio n, entit led Re al Simple, told the story of a poor wom an named Morn- ing Naughton, 34 years old in the f lesh, hundreds of years old in spirit. If the phone didn’t ring at an expensive jewelry store, it was Ms. Naughton who w asn’t calling. If no one was admiring the new SUVs in a No rth Carolina showroom, it was Ms. N aughton wh o stayed at home. If you were to check the credit card records for sales of expensive vacations, fancy hotel rooms, extravagant fur coats, or top restaurants, you would not find Ms. N aughton ’s name. Alas, said Real Simple, the woman had a real problem; she was “fru- gal to a fault.” “She has n ever had credit card debt, sh epaysallherbillsontime and she typically saves $500 each month—on a s alary of about $30,000,” we are told. “H er husb and, JasonM ichaels...worries about her inability to in- dul ge herself...or h im.” The plot thickens. “And he wonders if her scri mping sends the wrong message to the ir chil d.” “I realize she can’t help hersel f,” says Jason. “But her obsession with saving can drive me nuts.” But never was there a problem under the bright sun of America that didn’t have some sort of fraud creeping in the shadows behind it. Read- ing about Ms. N aug hton, economists saw a threat; if other consumers were to do the same, the whole shebang would be in trouble. Psychol- ogists, on the other hand, saw an opportunity; some would prepare 12-step programs to help overcome it. Others would offer drugs and counseling. Bo th econom ists and psychologists can relax. If fru gality is a disorder, it is too rare to worry about. The odds of coming down with it are as remote as integrity in public off ice. Besides, thrift—even if it were a diso rder—is one that comes and goes. If people are saving too much, or too little, just wait; it will go away."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"244 EV ENING IN AMERICA Ms. N aug hton—through no fault of her own—tumbled into an un- usual situation. One generation creates; the next dissipates. One genera- tion earns; the next burns. One generation composes, the next disposes. Mor ning Naughton was merely born at the wrong time. “In the 1970s,” began a recent letter from a reader of our daily e-mail, the Daily Reckoning, “I recall seeing many people, children of the Depres- sio n, ravaged by inf lation. They rem embered the ‘bad times’ and were loath to take on debt—even if it would have been prudent to borrow and pay bac k in cheaper dollars. In the face of rising prices, they would slam their wa llets shut or buy used, rather than new—‘I’d never pay that much for a new car!’ They held their dollars, steadfastly refusing inf lation hedges, and watched, even increased their dollar position, as the inf lation storm ravaged their holdings.” “W hen Morning was 9,” continues the Real Simple analysis, “her parents divorced, and she moved wi th h er father to Cape Cod. Her dad did some construction work to make money, but he was an artist at heart. ...She worked at a multitude of odd jo bs, including baby sitting, to make money. At age 10, she opened her f irst savings account. At 13, she started paying all the bills by f illing out the information and having her dad sign the checks. . . . ‘My childhood left me with this extreme anxiety about parting with money. I always need a safety net.’ ” She may be the only American on two legs who still worries about falling. But she can always try therapy. “Were it not for her husb and and child, Mo rnin g...mightnotbemotivatedtochan ge,” Real Simple explains. “Af ter more than 20 years of belt-tightening, Morning knows she needs to relax. ‘I don’t want [my so n] Spencer to grow up with the same mon ey anxieties I have,’ she says. ‘Being so frugal has become a burden, and I want to change. But it’s hard after a lifetime of being this way.’ ” We wish her luck. But we offer advice: Don’t change too much. Old habits might turn out to be useful. Who knows? Fru gality could make a com eback. It always does. TH E OWNERSHIP SOCIETY A great empire can be viewed as a vast public spectacle.

Turns out, the off icial estimates inc luded 2004 and 2005, that is, two years before the program existed. The real 10-year cost of the program f loated through the news months later at $720 billion. Americans voted for their repre senta- tives in Congress and the White House; the politicians voted for the free drugs. Thus, was the divine right of the majority—the brute power of the more to tell the few what to do—purif ied by the ballot box. The polite forms of the old republic were respected. But the essential act was a sin and a crime. Why should some Americans get drugs at other Americans’ ex- pens e? Is it not larceny on the part of one and complicity on the part of the other? And how will those “others” pay for it; are they not already on the hook for $44 trillion in unfunded federal obligations? But now the scam is the law of the land. George W. Bush wants to cr eate an “ownership society.” But it is a strange form of owners hip. Much of what Am ericans believe they have a right to belongs to someone else. Their retirements and health benef its, for example, must be stolen from other people before they can be handed out. Even things they think they paid for are actually on the balance sheet of other people. More and more houses are really owned by mortgage f inance comp anies. Cars are owned by GMAC and other auto f inancers. People expect to retire on the equity locked up in their houses. But they own less of their own houses than ever before; now, someone claims to own them, too—the lenders. And Social Security? A forensic accountant could pore over the books for a thousand years and never f ind a trace of the cash sup- posedly stashed away for Americans’ retirement. It doesn’t exist. Mr. Bush says he wants to change that. He wants Americans to own their own retirement funds—with private accounts invested in stocks. The you ng have wised up to Social Security. There is no way they can get a dec ent return on investment in Social Security; they want out. The old are alarmed too; they’re afraid that the something for nothing they’ve grown to expect will turn out to be more nothing than something. And the Bush administration wants votes from both groups. So, it does what you would expect; it deceives and dissembles. It doesn’t matter what we think about it.

De cisions are made in two parts of the brain, the researchers told us. The f irst part is the lateral prefrontal cortex. This is where advanced, log- ical thinking is supposed to happen, such as when a person decides which investment to make or which automobile offers the most value for the money. Deeper down in the gray mat ter is another decision center, the mo re primitive limbic system, where he actually decides which car to buy—usually the one that best suits his own prejudice. If he thinks he is a manly man, he buys a big American-made truck, or maybe a Hummer. If he prefers to think of himself as an intellectual, he goes for a foreign make, maybe an Audi or a Volkswagen. Behind the wheel of a German car, he feels at one with Hegel and Schopenhauer. Or, if he is a hip environmen- tali st, he will want to advertise that, too; in a sleek hybrid he will feel as smug as a teetotaler in a beer hall. Re searchers believe that the limbic system decides our likes and dis- likes, and tells us how to react to immediate stimuli. When a dump truck cuts you off in traff ic, the limbic system almost automatically wants to cock your right arm and middle f inger in the traditional salute, before your lateral prefrontal cortex can warn you against the gesture. In the upper part of the brain, Americans realize that they need to save for their retirement. But the limbic system insists on buying a new wide-screen TV instead. Though the researchers’ report was circulated in 247"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"248 EV ENING IN AMERICA the media as though it meant something, it left us only more p uzzled than befo re. When did Americans acquire this limbic system, we wondered? Up until 1980, American savings rates were around 10 percent of in- com es. Did some kind of evolutionary mutation occur in the early years of the Reag an administration? An d how com e the Ch inese don’t seem to have the same problem? They are said to save 25 percent of their incomes, while we save less than 1 percent. Someone ought to pry open a Chinese skull and take a peek to verify this, but our guess is that the Chinese have limbic systems, too. At least the sc ientists were wise enough to realize that not every thought that passes through the human brain makes any logical sense. The most powerful thoughts—strong enough to put the average American’s retirement f inancing, and even his life, in j eopa rdy—are not logical at all, but instinctive, atavistic, and primordial. GLOBAL IZATION AND IT S DIS CONTENTS Tw o thousand years ago, St. Peter urged a crowd to “turn away from this lost generation.” W. H. A uden spoke of the “low, dis hon est decade,” be- fore the Great War. Could our own generation be low, dis hon est, and lost? We have come to believe that things will l ast forever that couldn’t possibly be true for even a minute. In the spring of 2005, Fed governor Ben Bernanke told Americans that they were doing the world a great favor by borrowing its surplus savings. The globe suffers from a “glut” of savings, said he. Americans counted on overseas savers to lend them money. The overseas savers, said Bernanke, counted even more on American spend- thri fts to borrow it. The trouble wi th this analysis is no tthatitisflawed;butthatitdidn’t go quite far enough. The transaction Bernanke described is only half com- ple te. It is like a man who gets dressed in the morning by putting on his shirt, but forgets his pan ts. H egoesoutonthestreetandlooksridiculous. Anyone who looks at Ber nanke’s half-dressed explanation wants to point andg iggle. He has forgotten the essential part—how and when the lenders get repaid. The borrower only does th e lender a favor when he is capable of repaying it on the agreed terms. If he cannot, the transaction becomes a big disappointment for the lender.

The pool of peo- pleinthe wo rldw illing to work hard for $3,000 a year is enormous. Given such competition, why would U.S. wages go up? And without higher wa ges, how will Americans ever pay back what they have borrowed? But the world’s f inancial plumbing has become so curiously put to- gether that the oddest things have been mistaken for commonplace. We turn on the stove and champagne f izzes o ut. We open the faucet and it runs with Kent ucky bourbon; the whole thing is strange, but it doesn’t take long to learn to like it. The U.S. economy has been so strong for so long, people all over the world have come to accept its currency as though it were real money; they take it and ask nothing in return. In exchange for a shipment of TV sets, the Japanese take a wad of $100 bills and call it even. And here is another remarkable thin g: The bills tend to stay over- seas—where they are used to buy another form of U.S. paper, Treasury bond s. The United States can print as many $100 bills as it wants. So can it issue as many bonds and notes as it pleases. As long as people don’t try to exchange them for other forms of wealth—all is well. Re v. Al Sha rpton is clean. He is not an economist. He is against out- sourcing. That those qualif ications did not cinch the 2004 Democratic presidential nom ination for the man disa ppointed many people. That he had not been outsourced himself disa ppointed many others. For surely a clever fakir could be found in India who would be ready to make a public spectacle of himself at half the price. For that matter, all of Washington could be outsourced to the banks of the Ganges at a fraction of the price, but no one has yet suggested it. Joined by Dennis Kucinich and Ralph Nader, Sharpton believed the United States should disavow free trade altogether. As long as we are me mbers of the World Trade Organization, explained Kucinich in a de- bate, we cannot “protect the jobs ...this is the r eason why we have out- sourcing going on right now. We can’t tax it. We can’t put tariffs on it.” 2 To be nonpartisan about it, all the candidates’ positions on outsourc- ing were preposterous or scurrilous. There were those who want to stop it. And those who saw no problem with it. Every opinion was fraudu lent, delusional, or dumb. It was widely believed that the Chinese were stealing American jobs. Their factories hummed and belched smoke while U.S. facto ries went silent and sent up weeds in the parking lot. Th ew orld has been globalized for a long time.

In 1910, England had been the worl d’s number-one super-power and the world’s greatest econ- om y for two centuries. But g lobal competition had recently edged the British out of the top spot. American GDP surpassed it at the turn of the cent ury. Germany marched by a few years later. Relatively, England, that “weary Titan,” was in decline, and the g lobalized econ omy th at the British Empire helped create worked against it. Still, why would the English complain? They lived well—perhaps bet- ter than anyone else. Even if they didn’t, they thought they did. The rest of thew orld wa scontent. People liked buying and selling. People in Europe liked globalizatio n, because it brought them oranges in the wintertime. People in the warm latitudes liked it because now they had someone to buy theiro ranges. Even then, people spoke of the “annihilation of distance” and assumed that more miles would be destroyed in the years to come. Globalization is nothing more than the extension of the division of labor ac ross international boundaries. One of your authors passes much of his time in France. In his little village are the vestiges of a self-contained community. As recently as the end of World War II, almost ever ything people needed was produced right there. The farms grew wh eat. Farmers raised vegetables, cows, pigs, and chickens. There was a machine shop, a forge, and a woodworking atelier. There still remain the Versailles boxes, in which lemon trees were planted. The boxes allowed the trees to be moved into heated space in the winter. Otherwise, they would free ze and die. But as distance was annihilated, commerce in lemons was born. There was no longer any need to plant lemon trees in transportable wooden boxes when lemons could be shipped, quickly and cheaply, by the mil- lions. One country can produce lemons. Another can produce machine gun cartridges. Individuals, towns, enterprises, regions, can divide up the labor, work more eff iciently, and produce more things at lower co st.

You can do so honest ly or dishonestly. You can get it by working for it or by stealing it. You can get it by trade and com- merce or by force and fraud. You can get it by civilized methods or by barbaric ones. You can get rich by “economic means” or by “political means,” as the great German sociologist Franz Oppenheimer put it. Glob- alizat ion is me rely an elaboration of the economic means of getting things. It requires civilized relationsh ips for trade to work; people must get along with each other. They must rely on others—even other people in strange, faraway places—for important, maybe even es sential ite ms. They must also be able to count on the medium of exchange for trading goods and services. If they can’t trust the imperial money, they will switch to some- thing else. Th e end of history has been announced several tim es. But it never seems to arrive. People always tend to think that what is will remain, that present trends will continue at l east indef initely, and perhaps forever. Wh en the going is good, they tell themselves that the odds of anything going wrong are like the extreme edges of a bell curve—vanishingly small. But people badly “underestimate the persistence of history’s tradi- tional side, the rise and fall of empir es, the rivalry of regimes the disas- trous of benef icent exploits of great men,” wrote French historian Raymond Aron. That is to say, they tend to ignore the political means that shake things up and the rare “fat tail” events that make history inter- esting. Fat tails are those uncommon things that bunch up way out on the extremities of bell curves. They are things that shouldn’t happen very often, but that tend to happen more often than people expect. That is wh y the tail ends of bell curves have little bulges in them—or fat tails. Such a fat tail happened in 1914. A European war came after nearly 100 years of peace and progress. People thought the war could not hap- pen. And if it did happen, they said, it would be short and sweet. As we have see n, they were wrong on both points. Again, in the 1930s, came another “fat tail” event—a great depression. And once again, g lobaliza- tion en tered a shrinking phase. Some experts think glob alization can only f lourish under the pro- tection of an imperial armada, such as that of Great Britain in the nine- teenth century and the U nited States in the twentieth.

Switzerland has always en joyed heal thy trade with its neigh bors, despite never being part of an imperial system. And even within an empire (such as within the Soviet Union), trade might be more diff icult than trade between independent st ates. Still, in the free world until 1989, and now almost everywhere, a pax dollarium might have greatly a ided the cause of globalization throughout the second half of the twentieth c entury. America—and much of the rest of wo rld—enjoyed a great boom after World War II. They were years of high growth, low inf lation, and high employment. Tom Wolfe called it a “magic economy.” Real incomes doubled from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. So did household income and consumption per capita. Peo- ple were twic e as rich becau se they produced tw ice as much as they had a quarter century before. Productivity, or output per worker, rose 100 percent. But in 1973—two years after Richard Nixon took the nation off the gold standard—the economy lost its magic. No one knows exactly why. But that didn’t stop people from having opinions about it. Conservatives thought economic policy had been too soc ialistic; there were too many rules, too many taxes, and too many government expenses. Liberals thought there needed to be more contro ls; economists n eeded to manage the econ omy bet ter, like the Japanese did. Th ey also bl amed free trade, wh ich they saw as a threat to America’s dev eloped in dustries. It took many years to achieve, but year after year, all the world’s lead- ing industrialized nations added laws, regulations, and taxes designed to ma ke things better. And all these Wilsonian improvements cost money, reduced investment, or merely slowed down the economic machinery.

When Ronald Reagan f irst entered the White House, the rate was over 8 percent. “Gross national savings” (calculated by deducting capital imports from total domestic sav- ings) were nearly 20 percent of GDP in 1980.

By the 1990s, it was down to 3 percent. And in 2004, the number sank to 1.6 percent. Wi th no savings of their own, the country relied on foreigners to do the savings for them. But not only did the foreigners have to save, they had to be willing to buy U.S. f inancial assets—mainly Treasury bonds— den om inated in U.S. dollars. If they grew tired of it, or wary of it, the dollar could collapse. The odd thing about the spurt of globalization in the f irst f ive years of the twenty-f irst century was that it was so lopsided. The United States took, but it didn’t give. It borrowed, but it didn’t pay back. It bought, but it didn’t sell. It imported, but it didn’t export. The only reason foreigners put up with it is that they assumed their dollars would be as valuable in the future as they are now. They assumed that the trends of the previous 50 years would continue unchanged. They assumed that no terrorists would knock off an archduke, that they would never want for bread, and no fat tail would p lop itself do wn in the currency markets. Americans and their politicians preferred to see neither a glass half empty nor a gl ass half-full, but one that was full to the brim.

And Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan were creeping over to the punc h bowl with grins on their faces and bottles of gin in their hands. TA KE IT AWAY, M AESTRO In the spring of 2005, the American economy had been in “recovery” for over 37 months. It was an odd recovery. No one was quite sure what it was recovering from. There had been a recession in 2001 and 2002. But it was a curious recession. GDP growth went negative. Yet, consumer spending and credit continued to expand. If recessions were meant to cor- rect the mistakes of the previous expansion, this one was a failure. Con- sumers should have spent less and increased savings. Then, after the recession w as over, they should have had money to spend in the following expansion and a pent-up desire to buy what they had not bought during the recess ion. The expansion was doomed from the beginning. Consumers had nev er stopped spending. So, when the economy turned around, they had saved no money. The only way they could continue spending was by bor- rowing more. The Fed helpfully dumped more alcohol in the bowl—low- ering rates to make it easy for them. But by this time, the whole economy had become so woozy that the ext ra consumer spending had much less positive effect on the real economy than had been hoped. Americans bor- rowed and spent. But, in the new g lobalized economy, much of what they bought came from Asia—particularly China—which could turn out con- sumer goods at a lower cost than the United States. Wh at Am erica really needed was not a consumer bin ge, but a capital spending boom. It needed to inv est in new factories, new plants, and new jobs. The jobs would have given consumers real new income, with which to buy more goods and services and sustain the expansion. But gross in- vestment—which had averaged 18.8 percent in the pre-Reagan years— had begun dropping the year Reagan entered the White House. By 2004, it had fallen to 1.6 percent—even dipping below z ero periodically. People were sp ending, but on consumption, not future production.

Typically, at this stage of a recovery ( June 2005), 10 million more new jobs should have been cr eated. Like- wise, incomes went up $300 billion less than they should have, based on the pat tern of previous recoveries. Many economists—including Alan Greenspan—maintained that the lack of jobs was a sign of something good happening. “Productivity,” they said, “accounts for most job losses, not outsourcing.” “Over the long sweep of American generations and waves of eco- nomic change,” explained the maestro, “we simply have not experienced a net drain of jobs to advancing technology or to other nations.” 3 Could som ething be diffe rent this time? Could this be a kind of “new era” in American economic history? The answer we give is “yes” ...but we will give it later. Here, our burden is more modest, and our proof comes more readily to hand. For here, we argue only that America’s leading economic and political policymakers are either rascals or numskulls.

From high off ices all over the nation come the explanations, excuses, rationales, and obiter dicta; we don’t know whether they are corrupt or merely stupid.

Don’t worry about debt, interest rates, or the loss of jobs, says the captain of them all. It is as though the Na- tional Council of Bishops had come out with a public statement urging wife swapping. The experience may not be unpleasant, but it is unseemly of them to say so. “Go out and buy an SUV,” urged Fed governor Robert McTeer. 4 Seventeen million people heeded his call each year, from 2001 to 2005. On February 23, 2004, the Fed chief urged Americans to switch from fixed rate mortgages to ARMs—mortgages with adjustable rates, which left them muc h more exposed to interest rate increases, at the very mo- ment when the Fed was increasing them. If anyone could be held directly and immediately responsible for the record level of America’s foreig n and domestic debts, it was Alan Green span. He had brought about a binge of borrowing by lowering in- terest rates down to Eisenhower-era levels. But spiking the punch was not enough; he was urging consumers to have another drink."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"256 EV ENING IN AMERICA The Fed chairman had an uncanny way of arriving at ideas at a time wh en they would be of most benef it to his own career and of most danger to everyone else. To Greensp an, the conservative economist, the stock mar ket looked “irrationally exuberant” in the mi d-1990s, until a member of Co ngress pointed out to him that he would be better off keeping his mou th shut. A goldbug in the 1970s, Greenspan has now become the biggest purveyor of paper money th e world has ever seen. Similarly, large federal def icits seemed at odds with his creed until it suited him to think otherw ise. The new American empire needed easy mon ey and almost un- limited credit: Alan Greenspan made sure they got it. Markets make opinions, say old-time investors. Mr. Greenspan’s opin- ions neatly corresponded with the market for his services. As the debts and def icits mounted up, Greenspan underwent an intellectual metamorpho- sis. An article in the Ne w York Times explained: Many mainstream economists are worried about these trends, but Alan Green span, arguably the most powerful and inf luential economist in the land, is no t as concerned: In speeches and testimony, Mr. Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Re- serve Board, i spiecingtogetheratheory about debt that departs from traditional views and even from fears he has himself expressed in the past. In the 1990s, Mr. Greenspan implored Presi dent Bill Clinton to lower the budget def icit and tacitly condoned tax increases in doing so. Today, with the def icit heading toward a record of $500 billion, he wa rns more emphatically about the risks of raising taxes than about shortfalls over the next few years. Mr. Greenspan’s thesis, which is not accepted by all traditional econo- mists, is that incr eases in personal wealth and the growing sophistica- tion of f inancial markets have allowed Americans—individually and as a nation—to borrow much more today than might have seemed man- ageable 20 years ago. And here the article strikes gold: Th is view is good news for President Bush’s re-election p rospects. It increas es the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will keep shor t-term interest rates low. And it could defuse Democratic criticism that the White House has added greatly to the nation’s record indebtedness. 5"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Mo dern Imperial Finance 257 Out of convenience, rather than ideology, Mr. Greenspan came to see goodness in all manner of credit. Since he became head of the Federal Re- serve system, debt levels rose from $28,892 for the average family in 1987 to $101,386 in 2005. Mortgage foreclosure rates, personal bankruptcies, and credit card delinquencies rose steadily and are now at record levels. Mo rtgage debt rose $6.2 trillion during his tenure at the Fed. By January 2005, it had reached $8.5 trillion, or approximately $80,849 per hous ehold. 6 But none of this seemed to bother the chief of America’s central bank nor its chief politicians. WH AT HA TH AL AN WROUGHT? For years, we have been working on Greenspan’s obituary. As far as we know , the man is still in excellent health. We do not look forward to the event; we just don’t want to be c aug ht off guard. Maybe we could even rush out a quickie biography, explaining to the masses the meaning of Mr. Green span’s life and work. We see something in Alan Greenspan’s care er—his comportment, his betrayal of his old ideas, his pact with the Devil in Washington, and his at- tempt to hold off natur e’s revenge at least until he leaves the Fed—that is bot h entertaining and educational. It smacks of Greek tragedy without the bor ing monologues or bloody intrigues. Even the language used is Greek to most people. Though the Fed chairman speaks English, his words often need translation and historical annotation. Rarely does the maestro make a statement that is comprehensible to the ordinary mortal. So much the better, we guess. If the average fellow really knew what was being said, he wo uld be alarmed. And we have no illusions. Whoever attempts to ex- plain it to him will get no thanks; he might as well tell his teenage d augh- ter what is in her hotdog. Alan Greenspan is the most famous bureaucrat since Pontius Pilate. Like Pilate, he hesitated, but ultimately gave the mob what it wanted. No t blood, but bubbles. Greenspan’s role in the empire is more than that of a Consul or a Proconsul. He is the Prefect. He is the quarter- master who makes sure empire has the f inancial resources it needs to ruin itself. We don’t know how heaven will judge him. According to the central bankers’ code, Greenspan has committed neither sin nor crime. He is seen"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"258 EV ENING IN AMERICA as a paragon of virtue, not vice. Yet, as Talleyrand once remarked to Napo leon, “Sire, worse than a crime, you have committed an error.” When the winds of imperial debt-f inance blew, Mr. Volcker planted his feet and stuck out his jaw. His successor, Mr. Greenspan, tumbled over. The Fed chairman’s error was to offer more credit on easier terms to people who already had too much. During Greenspan’s reign at the Fed, mo re new money and credit has been cr eated than under all the rest of the Fed chiefs combined. Consumer debt rose to its highest level in history, the rat io of debt to income also rose higher than it has ever been. The ef- fect was to inspire bubbles all over the world and to transform the United States from the world’s largest creditor to its biggest debtor. What the Greenspan Fed had accomplished was to put off a natural, cyclical correction and transmogrify an entire economy into a monstrous economic bubble. A bubble in stock prices may do little real economic dam- age. Eventually, the bubble pops and the phony money people thought they had disappears like a puff of marijuana smoke. There are winners and los- ers. But in the end, the economy is about where it began—unharmed and unh elped. The households are still there and still spending money as they did before. Only those who leveraged themselves too highly in the bubble years are in any trouble. But in Green span’s bub ble econom y, som ething awful happened. Ho useholders were lured to take out the equity in their homes. They be- lieved that the bubble in real estate prices created wealth that they could spend. Many did not hesitate. Mortgage debt ballooned in the early years of the twenty-f irst century—from about $6 trillion in 1999 to nearly $9 trillion at the end of 2004—increasing the average household’s debt by $30,000. Americans still lived in more or less the same houses. But they owed far more on them. We had given up all hope of ever getting an honest word out of the Fed chairman on this subject when, in early February 2005, the maestro slipped up. He gave the aforementioned speech in Scotland entitled “Cur- rent Account.” Jet-lagged, his defenses down, the poor man seems to have commit ted truth. “T he grow th of home mortgage debt has been the major contributor to the decline in the personal saving rate in the United States from almost six percent in 1993 to its current level of one percent,” he admitted. Thus, did he bring up the subject. Then, he began a confession: The rapid grow th in home mortgage debt over the p ast f ive years has been “driven"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Mo dern Imperial Finance 259 largely by equity extraction,” 7 said the man most responsible for it. By thi s time, listeners were beginning to take notes. And pretty soon, even the dullest economist in the room was adding two plus two. Mr. Green span lowered lending rates far below where a free market in credit would have put them. With little to be gained by putting money in sav- ings accounts and a lot to be gain ed by borrowing, households did what you wou ld expect; they ceased saving and began borrowing. What did they borrow against? The rising value of their homes—“extracting eq- uity,” to use Mr. Greenspan’s jargon. The Fed chairman had misled them into believing that the increases in house prices were the same as new, dis- posable wealth. But the worl d’s most fa mous and most revered economist didn’t stop there. He must have had the audience on the edge of its chairs. He confessed not o nly to having done the thing but als otohavinghiswitsabouthim when he did it. This was no accident. No negligence. This was intentional. “Approximately half of equity extraction shows up in additional hou sehol d expenditures, reducing savings commensurately and thereby presumably contributing to the current account def icit. ...The fall in U.S. interest rates since the early 1980s has supported home price in- creases,” continued America’s answer to Adam Smith. 8 “Lacking in job creation and real wage growth,” explained Stephen Ro ach, “private sector real wage and salary disbursements have increased a mere 4 perc ent over th e f irst 37 months of this recovery—fully ten per- centage points short of the average g ains of more than 14 percent that oc- curred over the f ive preceding cyclical upturns. Yet consumers didn’t flinch in the face of what in the past would have been a major impediment to spendin g. Spurred on by home equity extraction and Bush administra- tion t ax cuts, income-short households push ed the consumption share of U.S. GDP up to a record 71.1 percent in early 2003 (and still 70.7 percent in 4Q04)—an unprec edented breakout from the 67 percent norm that had prevailed over the 1975 to 2000 period . . .” 9 Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, nearly everyone seems to agree that cent ral planning is bad for an economy. The central planners, as any Eco- nomics 101 st udent can tell you, do a poorer job of delivering the goods than the “invisible hand” of Mr. Market. Joseph Schump eter sharpened the point: “Our analysis leads us to bel ieve that recovery is only sound if it does come from itself.

The newborn slump was strangled in its crib by of the most central planners who ever lived. Alan Greenspan cut lending rates. George W. Bu sh boosted spending. The resultant shock of renewed, ersatz demand not only post poned the recession, it pushed consumers, inv estors, and busi- nesspeople to make even more egregious errors. Investors bought stock with low earnings yields. Consumers went further into debt. Government liabilities rose. The trade def icit grew larger. On the other side of the glob e, foreign businessmen worked overtime to meet the phony new de- ma nd; China has en joyed a capital spending boom as excessive as any the wo rld has ever seen. Our own Fed chairman, guardian of the nation’s money, custodian of its economy, night watchman of its wealth: How could he do such a thing? He turned a f inancial bubble into an economic bubble. Not only were the prices of f inancial assets ballooned to excess, so were the prices of houses and the deb ts of the average household. And the economy itself was trans- form ed. By 2005, the housing bubble was no longer an investment phe- nome non, but an economic one affecting almost everybody. In some areas, half of all new jobs were related to housing. People built houses; people f i- nanced houses; people remo deled hous es; people sold houses to each other; peop le put in so many granite countertops that whole mountains had been flat tened to quarry the stuff."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"12 Som ething Wicked This Way Comes T he force of a correction is equal and opposite to the deception and delusion that preceded it. Alan Greenspan, George W. Bush, and all the great n abo bs of positivism assure us that there is nothing to fear. Our favorite imperial columnist, Thomas L. Friedman of the New York Times, explained that “the next big thing almost always comes out of Am erica...[because]...America allows you to explore your own min d.” 1 Friedman believes the world would be a better place if America were more aggressive about “empowering women” and “building dem ocra cies.” He also thinks that technical innovations give America a perm anent advantage. Americans are always innovating, always f iguring thi ngs out. Heck, we even invented outsourcing, says Friedman: This is America’s real edge. Sure Bangalore has a lot of engineering schools, but the local government is rife with corruption; half the city has no sidewa lks; there are constant electricity blackouts; the rivers are choked with pol lution; the public school system is dysfunctional; beg- gars dart in and out of the traff ic . . . 2 and so forth. Among the things Mr. Friedman seems to lack is a feeling for verb tenses. He goes to Bangalore and notices that it is backward. His conclu- sion is that it will always be so. “Is” is forever in Friedman’s mind. “Will be” has no place. It is as if he looked at the stock market in 1982. “Stocks are cheap,” he might have said. “Stocks elsewhere are expensiv e,” he might 261"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"262 EV ENING IN AMERICA have added, without it ever occurri ng to him that they might change places. And yet, why else would a nyone outsource work from Baltimore to Bangalore unless Bangalore was relatively, though not necessarily perma- nent ly, cheaper? Let us imagine that Bangalore had no electricity blackouts or pollution or beggars. Let us imag ine that it was like Beverly Hills or Bo ca Raton. We might just as well imagine that stocks were expensive in 1982. Of course, if they had been, there never would have been the bull mar ket of 1982 to 2000. It is only because they were cheap in the past that they had the potential to be expensive in the future. And it is only because Bangalore is a Third World hellhole that it is cheap enough to take work away from overpaid Americans 10,000 miles away. Whether it will, nei- ther Friedman nor we can know. We a l w a ys try to get our day off on the right foot by reading Fried- ma n’s column before breakfast. There is som ething so glorio usly naïve and clumsy in the man’s pensée, it never fails to brighten our mornings. It refreshes our faith in our fellow men; they are not evil, just mindless. We have never met the man, but we imagine Friedman as a high school teacher, warping young minds with drippy thoughts. But to say his ideas are sophomoric or juvenile merely libels young people, m ost of whom have far more cleverly nuanced opinions than the columnist. You might criticize the man by saying his work is without merit, but, too, that would be flattery. His work has negative merit. Every column subtracts from the sum of human kno wle dge in the way a broken pipe drains the town’s water tower. No tthatM r. Friedman’s ideas are uniquely bad. Many people have similarly puerile, insipid notions in their heads. But Friedman expresses his hol lowt hough ts with such heavy-handed earnestness, it often makes us laugh. He seems completely unaware that he is a simpleton. That, of course, is a charm; he is so dense you can laugh at him without hurting his feelings. Friedman writes regularly and voluminously. But thinking must be painful to him; he shows no evidence of it. Instead, he just writes down wh atever humbug appeals to him at the moment, as unquestioningly as a mu le goes for water. One of the things Friedman worries about is that the world will “go dark.” As near as we can tell, he means that the many changes wrought after 9/11 are changing the character of the nation, so that “our DNA as a nat ion...has become badly deformed or mutate d.” In classic Friedman"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"Something Wicked This Way Comes 263 style, he proposes som ething that any 12-year-old would recognize as pre- posterous: another national commission! “America urgently needs a na- tional com mission to look at all the little changes that were made in response to 9/11,” 3 he wr ites. If a nation had DNA and if it could be mu- tate d, we still are left with the enormous wond er: What difference would a national commission make? Wouldn’t the members have the national DNA? Or should we pack the commission with people from other countries to get an objective opinion—a U.N. panel and a few illiterate tribesmen for cul- tural diversity? Friedman’s oeuvre is a long series of “we should do this” and “they shou ld do that.” Never for a moment does he stop to wonder why people actually do what th ey do. Nor has the thought crossed his mind that other peop le might have their own ideas about what they should do and no par- ticular reason to think Mr. Friedman’s ideas are any better. There is no trace of modesty in his writing—no skepticism, no cynicism, no ir ony, no suspicion lurking in the corner of his brain that he might be a jackass. Of course, there is nothing false about him either; he is not capable of either false modesty or falsetto principles. With Friedman, it is all alarmingly real. Nor is there any hesitation or bewilderment in his opinions; that wo uld require ci rcumspection, a quality he completely lacks. Friedman fears he may not approve of all the post-9/11 changes. But so wh at? Why would the entire world “go dark” just because America stoops to empire? The idea is nothing more than another silly imperial conc eit. America is not the light of the world. Friedman can stop worry- ing. The sun s hone before the U nited States existed. It will shine long after she exists no more. But, without realizing it, imperial conceits are wh at Mr. Friedman offers, one after another. He knows what is best for ever yone, al l the time. Bu tevena th is specialty, Friedman is second-r ate. It is not that his proposals are much dumber than a nyone els e’s, but he offers them in a dumber way. He sets them up like a TV newscaster, unaware that they mean anything, not knowing whether to smile or weep.

Friedman’s world is so neat. So simple. There must be nothing but right angles. And no problem that doesn’t have a commission waiting to solve it. It must be unfathomable to such a man that the world could work in ways that surpass his understanding. In our experience, any man who un- derstands even his own thoughts must have few of them. And those he has must be simpleminded. But we enjoy Friedman’s commentaries. The man is too clumsy to hide or di sguise the awkward imbecility of his own line of thinking. The silli- ness of it is right out in the open, where we can l augh at it. Arabs ought to shape up and start acting more like New Yorkers, he believes. If they don’t wa nt to do it on their own, we can give them some help. He says we can send “caring” and “nurturing” troops to “build democracies” in these places and “protect the rights of women.” But he doesn’t understand how armies, empir es, politics, or markets really work. American troops can give help, b ut it is the kind of help that Scipio gave Carthage or Sherman gave Atlanta. Armies are a blunt instrument, not a precision tool. Friedman urged the Bush administration to attack Iraq. But the man has a solution for every problem he causes. “So how do we get the Sunni Arab village to delegitimize [we love these big words—every one of them hides a whole dictionary of lies, f ibs, prevarications, malentendus, mis ap- prehensions, miscalculations, guesswork, hallucination, conce it, and men- dacity] suicide bombers?” Simple. Propaganda! “The Bush team needs to be forcefully demand- ing that Saudi Arabia and other key Arab allies use their news media, gov- ernment, and religious systems to denounce and delegitimize the despicable murder of Muslims by Muslims in Iraq.” 4 That ought to do it. What is wrong with the Bush team? Why didn’t they think of that? “Forcefully demand” that the Arab states do more propaganda. Y es, problem solved. By the way, your authors have no po sition on foreign pol icy. We only notice th at the people who do have them are idiots. Still we are not going to criticize Friedman. There is no sport in it. Th e poor fellow is evidently handicapped. He o nly sees things in two di- me nsions, like a drawing by a f ive-year-old with only one eye. He seems to have a one-eyed proposal each week: a “Reform Revolution” (what- ever oxymoronic thing that is); “nation building”; “a Manhattan project to develop a hydrogen-based energy econom y”; a “National Commission"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"Something Wicked This Way Comes 265 for Doing Things Right”; a “Patriot Tax” of 50 cents a gallon on gaso- lin e; a “Reform India” proposal; and many others too numerous and ab- surd to mention. Looking at the issue with two eyes and rounding on it a bit to get a better view, we see that things are not nearly as simple as Friedman must imagine. Th ings do not respond to commissions and good intentions. People do not always ge t what they want; sometimes they get what they deserve. Am erica’s roly-poly empire of consumer capitali sm, pax dollarium, airborne diplomacy, and debt has established order throughout most of the worl d. That order was immensely helpful to Americans in the f irst 60 years of the U.S. imperium. We made things that we could sell through- out the world—at a prof it. Today, the world still turns, but maybe not in our direction. There is a dark side to the human character. After people have enough to eat and a roof over their heads, they care more about their relative wea lth than their absolute wealth; they care more about their status than their souls. The pre sent imperial order benef its foreigners more than Americans. Real wages are rising in Asia. In the United States, they are stagnant. In relative terms, Americans are likely to continue to get poorer, even if they eliminate their trade def icit. The logic of human jealousy—and imperial f inance—has now shifted. The United States should not be willing to continue providing a public good—order—for no other return than the opportunity to compete on a lev el playing f ield. Industries in the United States are now losing that comp etition. Americans are beginning to re sent it. They are likely to in- sist that either we retire from the empire busin ess; or we take it up in a way that impedes globalized economic progress. Looked at this way, the Bush administration’s many actions make mo re sen se. Why invade Iraq? Because it creates disorder. Military adven- tur es are risky and destabilizing. And they are a shift from civilized means for getting what you want to using political means, which are not only in- herently disorderly but also favor America’s military strengths while min- imizing her commercial weaknesses. Why pressure China to revalue the yuan? Because it creates disorder. The yuan had been stable for 10 years— pegged to the U.S. imperial dollar at a f ixed rate.

Why run up huge federal def icits? Why give away money at the cost of consumer price inf lation? All these things are deeply disturbing to the world f inan- cial system; they b reed disorder. Wh at Friedman has not seemed to notice is that America’s advantage is past tense. If the United States really had been creating new products and new jobs, the evidence would be in the f igures. America’s trade f ig- ures wou ld not be preceded by a minus sign, but by a pl us, as they had been prior to Ronald Reagan’s entering the Wh ite House. America’s job numbers, too, would have been different. The number of new jobs cr eated in a single month—say, February 2004—would have been more like 200,000 (which would have been “normal” for that stage of the recovery) rather than the measly 21,000 that showed up. Ne ver before, since the beginning of the industrial revolution 300 years ago, have there been so many people outside the W estern world ready, willing, and able to compete with us. Never before have they had so much availa ble capital. While Americans spend all their money—and then som e, the average Chinese worker saves more than 20 percent of every- thing he earns. There are more engineers in the city of Bangalore, in India, than there are in the state of California. They work well and cheaply, taking home an average annual pay of about $6,000. And they seem to be just as innovative as their American counterparts. The software for DVDs was dev eloped in Bangalore, not in Silicon Valley, says the French newspaper, Libération. In the seven short years of its existence in Bangalore, the Philips research center alone has come up with 1,500 new inventions. Foreign workers have been cutting into Ameri can salaries for many years. Assembly line workers in Taiwan, Mexico, and other places have undermined factory wage growth in the United States. Over the past 30 years, real hourly earnings on the shop f loor have gone nowhere. No one particularly cared—because America’s economy was shifting to service and consumption anyway. Factory workers were out of fashion and out of luck. But now it is the accountants, architects, and paper shuff lers whose jobs are threatened. Even lawyers are worried; law f irms are outsourcing routine legal work to India.

So, we offer this little ref lection on outsourcing with nothing at risk but our reputation, which is to say we have little to lose. For ma ny, many years, Americans have had the high ground in the internat ional labor market. The playing f ield was tilted in their favor by the skills, capital, infrastructure, institutions, and habits built up over many ge neration s. They will still have an advantage for many years, but Friedman is right about one thing: The playing f ield gets more level every day. Hu ge economies—principally India and China—are on the rise, wh eth er we like it or not. By the middle of this century, estimates a Gold- man Sachs study, Russia’s living standards will be some 40 percent higher than America’s are today, China’s will have reached the same level as Japa n’s today, Brazil’s will be about the same as Britain’s today. Indians will have about the same incomes as Italians have today.

Americans’ GDP per head is expected to rise from $38,700 to $83,700, Britain’s from $26,000 to $59,000, Germany’s from $23,100 to $49,000, and Japan’s from $34,300 to $66,800.

THE GREAT CONCEIT While foreigners got richer, U.S. passport holders became delusional. They believed that they could get richer without saving or earning more money. In the United States, household consumption is 71 percent of GDP. Peop le think they areg etting rich er bec ause they have money to spend— bor rowe d money. But what makes a man, or a nation, rich is not spend- ing—it is not spending. We wouldn’t think it necessary to say so except that so many people still seem to believe the opposite. They see the GDP numbers as signs of a “healthy, growing” economy. But what is growing in the United States is the very thing that makes the economy un- healthy—consumption. For every dollar of product that the U nited States sellsabroad, it buys $1.60 worth of imported items, almost all of it con- sumer goods. China, as we all know, is on the opposite side of the planet. Over ther e, people make the things that we buy and don’t buy the things we ma ke. American households are rich and buy a lot. Chinese hous eholds are poor and buy little. Americans save little; the Chinese save a lot. Only 42 percent of Chinese GDP is domestic consumption. Another 35 percent is dev oted to exports. And nearly half of all the money spent in China, ac- cording to Stephen Roach, is for f ixed investment. Bo th econom ies are preposterously imbalanced. Both will pr obably fall down and break apart.

It ariseth wh en Americans buy more from non-Americans than they sell to them. Each year that passes, Americans buy, net, about $700 billion mo re in foreign imports than they make in overseas sales. That United States businesses are more prof itable than their Asian counterparts makes no difference. That the American economy is the most dynamic, f lexible, and delicious confection ever put up on God’s green earth is as irr elevant as tree rings. That foreigners want a piece of America is f lattering, but it is also as much a non sequitur as hemorrhoids. No r does it especially matter why Americans overspend. They have their reasons. But even if they had no reason, the result would be the same. If the nation we re a corporat ion, the difference between what came in and what went out—in dollar terms—would be the measure of its “loss from current operations.” If it were a family, it would be the rate at which it impoverished itself. If it were a business running such an imbalance for so ma ny years, it would have gone bankrupt long ago. Even a lesser nation wo uld have run into trouble years ago. Only an imperial power with the wo rld’s reserve currency could have gotten away with it. It is not particularly important that the U.S. economy is growing faster than its competitors as Mr. David Malpass claimed (in the Wall Stre et Jo urnal ), even if it were true. Nor does it matter that Asians have “no choice” but to buy U.S. dollar assets, as other commentators main- tain. Nor is it pertinent that the foreign investments repre sent a kind of tribute paid to the imperial power. The grim and unyielding fact is that each day, Americans grow “richer” in SUVs, f lat-screen TVs, and other consumer f lotsam and jetsam that come mostly from Asia (where the trade def icit is concentrated ), while the Asians grow richer in U.S. f inancial assets, notably Treasury bonds. Since 1990, foreigners have acquired $3.6 trillion worth of U.S. assets as a direct consequen ce of th e tr ade def icits. At a micro level, individually, this makes no great difference.

It is not for us to say he has made a good choice or a bad one. But Americans are not me rely trading a f inancial asset for a consumer asset. They have few f i- nancial assets to trade. People do not dip into capital to spend at Wal- Mart. They dip into debt. With no savings to spend, they cannot trade a f inancial asset for consumer f luff. So, they must trade a f inancial liability. This is just another consumer preference. It is no concern of ours if a man decides he wants a big-screen TV so badly he’s willing to go into debt to get it. He would rather have the additional debt than forgo the TV. But we suspect his preference rests on either delusion or fraud. The pref- erence assumes he will give up spending in the future for spending in the present. Most likely, he expects to give up neither. Every empire begins with a humbug. Later it dev elo ps into mass illu- sion, self-congratulation, hallucination, farce, and f inally disaster. Until the disaster comes, you never know quite where you are. Because for every imbecility that comes along, there are dozens of eager intellectuals ready to promo te it and at least half the population is ready to believe it. So it is that almost every day, we see a piece in the Wall Street Jour- nal explaining that trade def icits are no trouble. And at a certain level, they are no trouble at all. It does not matter to God who owes what to whom. Or even if it does, he keeps quiet about it. Some kibitzers point out that the United States ran trade def icits for muc h of its early history and that fast-growing countries always have cur- rent account def icits. After all, they are building som ething for the fu- ture—factories, plants, machines—that takes capital. Then, when the factories are built, they produce earnings and prof its, which are used to pay back the debt. In this instance, the debtor comes out ahead. Oh, the reverie of it! But when did you last see a factory, ref inery, or mine under construction in America? The last one we recall was a shiny new brewery outside Baltimore—and that must have been 40 years ago. Since then, it has gone out of business. Many economists believe we no longer need factories. They think the information revolution has many more good things to give us. We’re not aware of any benef its, yet, from the information revolution, but we’re prepared to believe there might eventually be some. But information is notoriously light on its feet.

They no longer go to Taiwan and ask the locals to “make this.” Now, they go to Taiwan to see what the lo- cals are making that they can sell back home. More and more, U.S. com- panies don’t even participate at the design stage. “Wh at we are seeing,” says Paul Craig Roberts, is the “rapid trans- form ation of America into a 3rd world economy.” 5 American f irms are increasingly left with only brands to market. But even those won’t last forever, after customers realize that the real innovation, design, and man- ufacture genius is overseas. Just as car buyers took up new brands as qual- ity increased in Japan, so will they soon take up new brands in other industries. Soon, Americans will not only want to spend on foreign-made goods, they will have to. Th e cycle is typical of empires in their mature sta ges. Even in decline, people still look to the homeland for fashion cu es. Music, education, the- ater, dress, architecture, and manners are exported from the center to the periphery long after commerce in more practical goods has reversed direc- tion. Even today, Vienna remains a regional cultural center—as do Paris and Rome. Parents from former colonies still dream of sending their chil- dren to Cambridge and Oxford. Meanwhile, the Newman brothers, Dan and Frank, also in the Wall Street Journal, point out th at the outf low of dollars is no cause for con- cern, because the dollars just come back to us. We concede they do or, they will. But they don’t come back as the same good-natured working stiffs they were when they left. Instead they come back from abroad in finer clothes, with f iner manners, and with a better accent. They come back as rentiers. They went out as a cre dit and come back as a liability. The next thing you know, they are putting their feet on the furniture and acting as if they own the place. Instead of helping the average man earn a living, they make it harder for him. For now they must be supported, too. Interest must be paid on debt or compounded into more debt. Either way, day by day, the burden just grows heavier. We know from experience that our moods can change for no apparent reason. One day, we are happier then usual. The next, on exactly the same set of “facts,” we are gloomy. One day, we are prepared to start a war. The next, trouble is the last thing we want. One day we think $20 is a fair price to pay for $1 of earnings. The next, even $10 seems too much.

They believe happy things; it doesn’t bother them th at the things they believe are impossible. After 20 years of mostly falling interest rates, mostly falling inf lation rates, and mostly rising asset prices (stocks and real estate), people have come to believe that this is the way the world works: Interest rates mostly go down, and house prices mostly go up; it goes on forever. Even the professionals in Squanderville have never been more cert ain: A 2005 poll of economists working for major brokerage houses found that 100 percent of them expected rising stock prices over the next 12 months.

THE WAY W E L I V E N OW As the year 2005 matured, the corpus of the world f inancial system be- came even more grotesque than it had been the day before. Connecting the thigh bone of bond yield s...to the hip bone of Asian purchases of U.S. bond s...to the vertebra of cre dit expansion ...we stood back in awe and wond er: What kind of monster was this? It looked like a creation of Frankenstein. The world’s richest, most powerful country, depends on the savings of the world’s poorest. The world’s foremost economy offers its money at negative real interest rates and is afraid to nor malize them for fear the whol e thing will collapse. Americans buy what they cannot afford, and the Chinese build factories to produce what their principal customers don’t have the money to buy. The whole world economy advances—ap- parent ly—only so long as U.S. house prices continue to rise at three to five times nominal inf lation and an inf inite multiple of hous ehold income, wh ich went backward in 2004. Whatever it may be, this is no ordinary economy—it has a hunchback and two club feet. Jobs that ought to exist don’t. Income that should be helpin g consumers to spend isn’t there. Savings that are vitally important to economic growth have disappeared. We loo k at the body parts—the Dow, the latest employment numbers, Co nsumer Price Index (CPI) rates, and so forth—every day. But most of wh at we read is “noise”—meaningless distractions. The news items only ma ke sen se wh en we con nect them to the spine. The best way to under- stand America’s economic predicament is to look at it as a system of impe- rial finance. The United States is an odd and reluctant empire.

So many examples come to mind: It is like trying to select the dumbest member of Congress; we don’t know wh ere to start. The dot-coms were so popular with in- vestors—and mining companies so unpopular—that at least one f irm that suppo sedly had been m ining gold switched to supposedly becoming a dot- com to take advantage of it.

By mid-2005, in Paradise, Nevada, they we re rising at nearly a 50 percent annual rate. “If you can fog a mirror, you can get a home loan,” said a mortgage analyst to the Los Angeles ( LA) Times. In the past, being able to fog a mirror was a necessary requirement for cre dit. Only now has it become suf ficient. If the present trend continu es, soon lenders will not even bother to hold up the mirror. There was no particular reason wh y the dead should be denied mort- gage credit; they would pr obably be at l east as good risks as many of the living who are getting it. Maybe better. At least they don’t skip town and don’t p ut their feet on the furniture. We are obviously on the cutting edge of new dev elopments in the credit industry. But judging from the ads seen on the Internet, we are not far in the lead. “Borrow up to $250,000,” says an advertisement. “Less than perfect credit is okay ....No income verification....No Home Eq- uit y requirement. ...24-hour approval.” Between 2001 and 2005, the property bubble raised house prices in California by $1.7 trillion. That is equiva lent to 35 percent of personal in- com e. Now, the whole economy not only enjoys a rising real estate mar- ket, it depends on it. Coast to coast, people buy big houses they can’t afford. They expect to sell them to someone else for more than they paid for them. What they do not expect is to pay for them themselves. How can they? What would they pay for them with? No one see ms interested in actually owning real estate. Houses have become like futures contracts. People trade on margin and never take de- livery. Houses are f inancial assets to be actively managed, just as though they were stocks or a sailboat. When interest rates dip, new credit is un- furled; the house is ref inanced at a lower rate with the borrower often tak- ing out a little cash to spend. If rates seem to be going do wn, more sailcloth is hoisted at an adjustable rate to catch the favorable wind. What if rates rise? What if the weather turns bad? The California Association of Realtors reported that only one in f ive households in the state had enough money to buy the house that one in two of them lived in; in some areas, it was only one in ten. There were thousands of million-dollar houses on the market. But there were few people with a million dol lars.

Even if you saved like the Chinese do, you wou ld be luc ky to be able to pay down $20,000 in principal each year. At that rate, it would take you 50 years to pay off the house.

The average American lives in a suburban house thought to be worth $188,800. Since stocks began to decline in January 2000, his net worth has not necessarily declined, but it has become less abstract; he now has to live in it. Even in Philadelphia. A hou sing bubble in Philadelphia? It seemed alm ost impossible. Who wo uld want to buy a house in Philadelphia, much l ess at a premium? But hou se prices rose in Philadelphia, and even in Baltimore. Parents and grandparents had been loath to spend more than 25 percent of their in- com es on rent or a mortga ge. Now, people are spending more than 50 per- cent. By mid-2005, it was reported that one in f ive new home buyers spent half their disposable income on housing. In America, the average house went up 44 percent in real terms be- tween 1995 and 2005. The increase was even greater in Britain and Aus- tralia. Americans have come to expect house price increases far beyond wh at the market is likely to give them. A survey by Shiller and Case found avera ge annual expectations of 12 to 16 percent—three to four times likely increas es in GD P and not much different from what inv estors had com e to expect from stocks in the late 1990s. Since these gains were almost as good as money “in the bank,” in the eyes of house buyers, many spent the money before it had been made. Equity withdrawal ( borrowing against the increased price of the house) rose to 6 percent of personal dis- posable income in the United States in 2004, 8 percent in Britain.

And again in March. And again in April. Housing starts nationwide were at a 21-year high.A ll over the 50 states, people were buying, f lipping, ref inancing. “It is as if you were paid to live in California,” said a skeptic to the LA Times. 2 Prices rose 22 percent in 2004. It meant that an average homeowner, with an average $400,000 house, added $88,000 to his net wort h. He did this without lifting a f inger. In the Bay Ar ea, houses wer eselli ng for half again as much as people asked for them. The LA Times ment ioned a house offered for $980,000 that sold almost immediately for $1.5 million. The Times told ofa young woman who bought her f irst house with no money down and “ interest only” payments. In 2001, fewer than 5 percent of new houses were pur- chased with “interest only” mortgages. By mid-2005, the total was nearly 50 perc ent.

What they need is a “fresh prospective”: “They’re not being foolish; they’re looking at it differently than people who have been in the market for a long time.” 4 Forget the wisdom of the dead, in other words. This is a new era. People buy property now as they bought tech stocks f ive years ago— without any regard for earnings. It is all a greater fool game—betting that someone will come along who is an even big ger numskull than you are. Th e game continues such a long time that people come to see it as eternal. And the more conf idence people have in it, the more reasons they invent that it should go on. Most experts cite “demographic facto rs” as guaranteeing higher residential property pric es. There are supposed to be many more people who will need a roof over their heads in the years ahead. According to the theory, there are so many new immigrants and baby boomer childr en that the homebuilders can’t keep up with them. Prices will rise. Why the homebuilders can’t build enough hou ses to keep up with the demand is a matter of deb ate. How the new buyers will be able to pay higher prices—when incomes are falling—is no t clear either. And there is always the outside chance that these new households may rent. Rental yields are falling; relatively, rents are ch eap. Amajorr eason given for why stock pric es had to continue rising in 1999 was that so many people were putting so much money into stocks for their retirements. The log ic was supposedly irrefutable: The baby boomers must save money. They had no choice but to put it into stocks. Stocks had to go up. The reasoning was perfect—as long as stocks went up. But then something happened; stocks went down. Baby boomers felt little desire to buy stocks. But t he “de mographic fa ctors” argum ent was still perfectly serviceable for the hou sing market. It will work fine—until houses go down in price. On April 10, 2005, an article entitled “The Hunt, Becoming a Mog ul Slowly” appeared in the Ne w York Times. It told the story of a 25-year-old New Yorker, who had been making real estate deals ever since 2002. Drawing on this deep well of experience, the young Trump offered advice. “An apartment is more attractive to me when other peo- ple want it.

Whatever price he paid was okay—because it was the price others were will ing to pay. The Times article told us that “his success has inspired six of his you ng, former-renter friends, to follow in his experienced footsteps,” be- cause “I made it seem like a very cool thing to d o.” Meanwhile the real Do nald Trump said he was getting a million dollars a pop just to tell you ng mogul-hopefuls his secrets. 5 In mid-2005, you only had to get in a cab to realize that the real estate boom has become a bubble. Cabdrivers would point out how much houses have gone up. While once they gave tips on tech stocks, now they told you which neighborhoods were likely to experi- ence the greatest price inf lation. Listen carefully, and you were likely to overhear drivers on their cell phones talking to real estate agents about their new condos. “My d aug hter is only twenty-f ive,” wrote a friend, “but she just bought a house in Northern Virginia. Of course, she mortgaged most of it. But can you believe that they lent her $275,000? Is that crazy, or what? She works as a bartender, part time. She’s very responsible and is good for the money, I’m sure, but I can’t believe they would lend her that much money. How do they th ink she will pay it back?” The trick was to f ind a “f ixer-upper,” do a little cosmetic work on it, and put it right back on the market. So many people were looking for fixer-uppers that canny sellers were considering deliberately making a wreck of their houses—so prospective buyers could hallucinate about how muc h money they would make after f ixing them up. In the spring of 2005, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation identif ied 55 ar eas in the nation that it said were undergoing a boom in residential real est ate. These were areas where prices rose 30 percent or more ov er the preceding three years. Not in 30 years had so many parts of the country experienced such a boom, said FDIC. Even in the last boom of the 1980s, only half as many areas met the test. Na tionw ide, house prices rose 40 percent from January 2001 to Jan- uary 2005.

At the end of the 1990s, people joined investment clubs so they could yak about stocks with other people who didn’t know anything either. In 2005, they joined real estate clubs. There were at least 177 of them by mid-year. Me mbers get together to talk about “techniques” and “strategies.” Four of these “strategies” are recorded for the benef it of future Donald Tr umps, and perhaps history, in the Times article: (1) Buy a house, hold it, and sell it later, (2) buy a house, f ix it up, and sell it, (3) f lip the damn hou se before you actually have to pay for it, and (4) rent the house for more th an it is worth, giving the tenant the right to buy it in the future.

Maybe it was the 12.5 percent gain in real estate nationwide in the previous 12 mon ths? Or maybe it was the 50 percent increase in housing prices in f ive years? In hot markets—such as California, Florida, and Washington, DC—prices had gone up 60 percent in two years. It was a “real estate gold rush,” said the cover of Fort une magazine.

But all the increase happened in just two brief pe- riods: right after World War II, and since 1998. Other than those two peri- ods, the real price of housing was either f lat or falling. The big difference between the period following World War II and the present era was that bac k then the U.S. economy was growing and he althy. Am erica not only had a positive trade balance, but had the most positive one in the world. Wa ges were going up, so people could afford more expensive houses. Fam- ilies were expanding faster than the economy—so they n eeded more houses. But now, households are getting smaller. Incomes are stable or shr inking. The nation spends more than it earns; it desperately counts on rising hou se prices—and the savings of poor people in foreign coun- tries—just so it can continue living be yond its means. Lenders come up with creative f inance to permit themselves to lend money to peop le who can’t pay it back. Houses in some areas are already so expensive that barely 1 buyer in 10 can afford a median-price house. And Playmates of the Month are giving up strutting their stuff to invest in real estate. This is not a normal situation. Other news stories told of friends who were teaming up to buy houses—they had become too expensive for a single couple to afford on its own. The main cause of foreclosure is said to be couples who divorce, bel ieve neither one wants or can afford to keep the marital home. Imag- ine two couples. You might think the risk would double. In fact, it prob- ably quadruples—or more. Either couple might break up. Even more likely, the tw o couples might decide they can’t stand each other. A len der would have to be brain-dead to agree to such a sale. But in 2005, many did. This is the great comedy of the f inancial markets. They put a fool to- gether with his money just so they can get a good l augh by taking it away from him. These “investors” think they are geniuses. They think their techniques and strategies are making them rich. Of course, tech stock speculators also thought they were getting rich. Then, they lost “a ton” of their portfolios. It is amazing that they have a ton left. But that is going soo n, too, we imagine. As prices rose in 2005, Congress wanted to know if the Fed might raise rates faster than anticipated.

For the very same day, as headlines made clear, inf lation and inf lation expectations—notably in the housing market—were under full sail in hurricane-force winds. The cost of housing, in many areas of the country, was not just inf lat- ing—it was blowing up like a front-seat air bag.

And yet, few people save any money. “Savings rates have never been lower,” Stein explains. “In 1999, the national savings rate dipped below 3 percent for the f irst time since 1959, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. It has been decl ining fur- ther since then, and in 2004 it was at a mere 1 percent. The low savings rate, coupled with large def icit f inancing by Asian banks, is dangerous for the U.S. But it’s more dangerous for individuals.” Peop le are forever crying alarm about this or that. There is a cr isis in health ...a cr isis in moral values ...a cr isis in the Middle East ...or in the newspaper trade. For all the whining, there is usually little that can be done about the emerge ncy, and if it is left alone, it generally takes care of itself in its own way. “Nearly 28 million U.S. households—37 percent of the total—do not own a retirement savings account of any kind,” continues the Forbes arti- cle, “Among the households who owned a reti rement savings account of any kind as of 2001, according to a 2004 report by the Congressional Re- search Service (CRS), the average value of all such accounts was $95,943. That number was distorted by the relatively few large accounts, and the me dian value of all accounts was just $27,000. “The medi an value of the retirement accounts held by households headed by a worker between the a ges of 55 and 64 was $55,000 in 2001,” the CRS says. To that, Stein adds that “just 11 percent of all Americans have retirement savings of $250,000 or more.” 10 Yo u can jabber to peop le about saving money until your jaw falls off; they’re not going to put an extra dime in a savings account—not when property prices are going up at 10 percent per year and the Fed is still giving away money. Eventually, however, th e things t hat must happen sooner or later do happen. Of course, that’s when people wish they had saved money. That’s when they’ll really need it. That’s when the whining really begins. Saving—like manufacturing—is one of those early-empire virtues that was once an important part of the American economy ...but seems to have gotten exported. The Chinese now make our products and do our saving for us. They save more than 25 percent of their income. According to Ben Bernanke, they now have so much of savings, they are thankful to us for taking it off th eir hands."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"288 TH E ESSENTIAL INVESTOR As a percentage of GDP, consumer sp ending in China is only half what it is in the United States. Americans, for example, consume 25 percent of thew orld’s oil. China, with four times as many people, uses just 7 percent. But what goes around comes around. When the U.S. real estate bub- ble pops ...some of that old virtue is likely to make its way back home. Americans will save again. Whereas they put aside only a penny on the dollar now ...they are likely to set aside 10 cents or more. The savings crisis will be over. A new crisis can then begin: a depression. In traditional economic theory, p eople save. Their savings are bor- rowed by entrepreneurs and businesspeople to build new enterprises, new factories, and new consumer items. This new output is then sold at a prof it, which creates new jobs—and higher incomes—that give people more pur chasing power, more savings, and so forth. But in modern America’s fabulous twenty-f irst century economy, thi ngs happen so much differently that we wond er: Is the theory mis- taken...or are Americans? Hardly a dime is saved today. We have not seen a new factory put up in the past 20 years, though we don’t deny there must have been a few. ( We’ve seen dozens of shopping centers buil t.) Per hou r, jobs pay little more—in real terms—than they did 30 years ago. Yet, Am ericans seem to have more purchasing power than ever. Som ething is wrong. The picture is gro tesque, unnatural ...like a pretty wife who rotates her own tires—it is almost too good to be true. We suspect we’re going to f ind out later that she sets f ire to her cat. The problem with not saving money is that you won’t have any. If you wa nt to do anything be yond what you’re already doing, you have nothing saved up to do it with. Even current levels of consumption cannot be main- tain ed. Factories wear out and need to be rebuilt. Competitors race ahead. Th ere is no standin g still. Yo u are either going forw ard...or falling be- hind. “Day by day, all the earth ages, dr ooping unto deat h,” saith the old Anglo-Saxon poets. You need a reserve of “energy”—savings—to give it life again. Even the mainstream media has begun to notice how odd things have bec om e. “If current trends continue, the United States will borrow an un- precedented $1 trillion this year alone, mostly from a broad, a sum that is ref lected in huge U.S. budget and trade def icits. Any sane analyst has to wond er how long it can last. . . .” The quotation comes from the Interna- tional Herald Tribune ’s editorial page. “The most powerful way to in- crease national savings it to cut the budget def icit,” continues the IHT."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Welcome to Squanderville 289 “T o do that, Bush and his allies in Congress must defer the gratif ication they would derive from showering more tax cuts on the aff luent.” Ho w then can Americans live so well—without savings? The IHT explains: “Some argue that the amount of personal savings is understated bec ause it does not take into account the increase in housing values, which has many homeowners feeling f lush. But elevated home values do not add to national savings [or to national wealth, we add]. “Such wealth is not converted into cold hard cash until a house is sold, and at that point the money f lowing into the seller’s pocket is simply money th at is f lowing out of the buyer’s pocket. No new wealth is cre- ated, unless the seller saves the windfall—which is generally not the case in today’s consumer economy. Instead, sellers increase their purchasing powe r, wh ile the saving rate declines and the United States as a whole be- com es poorer.” The old theory is right after all—it works. People do save, they do in- vest, and they do get richer—just as they’re supposed to. They just don’t happe n to live in the United States of America. The world economy has been globalized. In the new, international division of labor some people save and get rich. Others consume and get poorer. China, as we all know, is on the opposite side of the planet. Over there, people make the things that we b uy and don’t buy the things we ma ke. American households are rich and buy a lot. Chinese hous eholds are p oor an d buy little. Americans save little; the Chinese save a lot. Only 42 percent of Chinese GDP is domestic consumption. Another 35 percent is devoted to exports. And nearly half of all the money spent in China, according to Stephen Roach, is for f ixed investment. The truth is that we are becoming a nation of sharecroppers—but only a rich old man like Warren Buffett has the courage to say so. We do not earn enough to pay our way, so we borrow from our suppliers. Asia has become the company store to which we owe our souls. THE COMING CO RRECTION To ut passé, tout casse say the French.

Empires come. Empires go."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"290 TH E ESSENTIAL INVESTOR In the f inancial markets, the “going” phase is called a cor rection. It is intended to correct the excesses and mistakes of the expansion phase. In a bull ma rket, there are corrections that bring extraordinary gains down to mo re mod est ones. In a bear market, corrections—which soften extraordi- nary losses into more ordinary ones—are known as rallies. Gen erally, the force of a correction is equal and opposite to the trend that precedes it. And the pain it causes is directly proportional to the pleas- ant deception that went before it. As a practical formula, this does little to help us. We still do not know when or how the correction will come. And, to borrow an idea from Lord Ke ynes, the deception can last a lot longer than you can remain solvent betting against it. And yet, it is even more dangerous to bet on it. Am erica’s empire of debt rests on many huge deceptions that we have described in this book: • That one generation can consume—and stick the next with the bill. •T hat you can get som ething for nothing. •T hat the rest of the world will take American IOUs forever—no questions asked. •Th at house prices will forever go up. • That American l abor is inherently more valuable than foreign labor. •T hat the American capitalist system is freer, more dynamic, and mo re productive than other systems. •T hat other countries want to be more like America, even if it is forced on them. •Th at the virtues that made America rich and powerful are no longer required to keep it rich and powerful. • That domestic savings and capital investment are no longer necessary. •T hat the United States no longer needs to make things for export.

Mr. Green span, who surely must have known better, found nothing to dislike and nothing to worry about. So, we stop, draw breath, and wonder. The deception is so large, we wonder how it could ever be fully cor- rected. We speak not merely of Mr. Greenspan’s perjury before Con- gress, but of the larger deception, in which Mr. Greenspan plays a leadin g role. The promise of American capitalism is that it makes people richer, free r, and more independent. But since the introduction of the Fed and the rise of the empire, the currency in which Americans keep score has so ad- dled the f igures, we scarcely know if we are winning or losing. The dollar we knew as a child—in the 1950s—is only worth a tenth as much today. The average household today has far more of them than we did. In 1950, U.S. household debt to disposable income, which is basically after-tax in- com e, was 34 percent (if disposable income was $10,000, households had $3,400 in outstanding debt). Today, the average American hous ehold has learned to live large—on an imperial scal e. Its house is worth more dol- lars. It has a bigger car. It eats out more often. It has a wider TV screen with a clearer picture. It has more employment insurance. More health in- surance. More Social Security Insuran ce. More pr otection offered by more gove rnment employees th an ever before. It has many more credit cards, with much larger lines of credit. It has more clothes. More toys. Mo re gadgets, gizmos, and whatchmacallits. It has more debt. More obli- gation s. More chains. Almost every American believes he is richer. Certainly, compared with the Ol d World, Americans have no doubt that the rise of their em- pire improved every subject’s life. Is it true? We pause to deliver a shocking update. People love myth, fraud, and clap trap— especially when it f latters them. Maybe their food, life expectancy, crime rates, transportation, liquor, women, and architecture are nothing to brag about, say Americans to each other, but wh en they grub for money, they grub good. “Old Eu- rope,” they say, making a comparison, “is too rigid, fossilized, hi debound ...a muse um.” And yet, even this is a fraud.

Ta ke ou t G e r m a n y—which has s trugg led with absorbing its formerly communist cousins from the East—and the two regions are exactly the same. And productivity? A study by Kevin Daly, an economist at Goldman Sachs, f inds that, after adjusting for differences in their economic cycles, trend productivity growth in the euro area has been slightly f aster than that in America over the past 10 years. What about jobs? America is the greatest jobs machine on the planet, right? Again, excluding Germany, jobs in the rest of Europe grew at the same pace as in America. And more jobs have been cr eated in the euro. It’s true that Americans earn more and spend more than Europeans ...but they work a lot more hours. Europeans simply enjoy leisure more. But what about the post-2001 “recovery?” Hasn’t it been much more vigorous in America than in Europe? We l l, only on the surface. Spiked up by the biggest dose of f iscal and mon etary juice in history, America’s economy has slightly outpaced Eu- rope’s. But the f igures are hard to compare.

While Europe got no net stimulus, America has gotten enough to give it the shakes. “Super-lax policies of the past few years have left behind large economic and f inancial imbalances that cast doubt on the sustainability of America’s growt h,” says the Economist. “From a position of surplus before 2000, the structural budget def icit (including state and local governments) now stands at almos t5percent of GDP, three times as big as that in the euro area.

Since 1990, income for the average American household has risen only 11 percent while average household spending has jumped 30 percent. How could p eople spend so much more money without earning more? Outstanding household debt doubled to more than $10 trillion between 1992 and 2004, even adjusted for inf lation. And in Utah last year, 28 of every 1,000 hous eholds declared bankruptcy, alm ost three times the rate of a decade earlier. Peop le are determined to live large and live better than they can af- ford. They do this by what economists call smoothing income. Anticipat- ing higher incomes in the future, young families spend the money now (e.g., buying bigger houses than they can afford ). Nationwide, house sizes have grown 30 percent since 1980, says Cornell economist Robert Frank. And now even people in their 50s and 60s look forward to either higher incomes or miracles. Some econom ists refer to the whole phenomenon as the “democrati- zation of credit.” “Innovation and deregulation have vastly expanded credit availability to virtually all income classes,” says the Fed chief. 11 He did not mention his own role in this democratic revolution. He is too mod est. He is a Danton and Robespierre put together. The Fed chairman accomplished more than all the nation’s innovators and deregulators put together. Dropping the price of credit below the inf lation r ate, he offered the entire world something for nothing. Now, everyman could get him- self into f inancial trouble, not just kings, speculators, and f inanciers. He made it possible for lending institutions to extend such a long rope of credit to the common man that millions are sure to hang themselves.

WH AT WI LL HAPPEN TO AMERICANS’ DEBTS? “He that d ies pays all debts,” said Shakespeare. 12 Who pay sthese debts? And how? The total value of all assets in America is only about $50 trillion. Cur- rent U.S. debt is about $37 trillion. Add to it the pre sent value of Federal government liabilities and America is broke. Busted. Bankrupt. No bread. Like nothing. It couldn’t pay it s debts even if it wanted to. When people cannot pay their debts, they do not pay them. But the deb ts do not cease to exist. They are merely “paid” by someone else—the creditor. In the case of America’s debts to foreign nations, this can be achieved in three ways: the currency in which the debt is denominated can be dev alued against other currencies; the currency can be made less valuable through inf lation; or the debt can be repudiated. One of these things—or all of th em—is likely to happen. Re pud iation has a long and squalid history. If a man can get away without paying his debts, he will generally f igure out why he shouldn’t have to pay them. In public life, the reasons are often very good ones. When a new political regime takes over, why should it be stuck with the bills of the old one? When the Bolsheviks took over Russia in 1917, they made Tsarist bonds worthless. Why should they pay bills that they never agreed to? Why should they honor commitments of one capitalist to an- other? They didn’t pay.

In America, several states—Michigan, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Florida—totally and permanently repudiated their debts in the panics of the 1840s. In the 1880s, many Southern states repudiated the debts that had been run up by illegitim ate carpetbagger governments. But the United States doesn’t have to repudiate. All its debts are denominated in its own currency—the value of which it can control. Having the world’s reserve currency means you can stiff your creditors without ever having to say you’ re sorry. THE DEMI SE OF THE DOLLAR Among the many remarkable stories that appeared in the press in the years from 2000 to 2005, the story of Mr. Asakawa stood out. The United States economy has been so strong for so long, people all over the world have come to accept the imperial currency. By 2005, no one had more of it th an poor Mr. Asakawa in Tokyo. The man con- trolled the biggest stash of U.S. paper in the world. His life had come to imitate a popular joke. “A man who owes his banker $100,000 can’t sleep at night,” the joke begins. “But when a man owes his banker $1 millio n, it’s the banker who can’t sleep.” Mr. Asakawa is the central bank’s banker. At the end of 2004, he held an estimated $700 billion wo rth of U.S. dollar-denominated paper assets in his vault at the Finance Ministry. Beside his bed was a blue plastic monitoring device that would go off like an alarm clock when the dollar fell out of a given trading chan- nel.

Rather than take the chance, he typical ly shifts his portfolio from capital gains to income. His risk toler- ance also shifts, from return on investment to return of investment; and his savings strategy drifts, too, from just-in-time to just-in-case. Everything important happens at the marg in, as the economists say. The marginal grumpy old man of the 1990s entered the stock market along with every one else. Who could resi st such a party? So, along he came, dressed for a funeral but hoping for a good time. If he got into stocks in 1997, his portfolio in 2005 is now worth about what it was when he bought the stocks. But in the meantime, his debts increased, his savings went down, and the cost of living rose 12 percent over the past f ive years. Amos Tversky, a Stanford University psychologist, found that people wo uld rather not lose money than make it. This conf irmed som ething that did not need conf irmation, a self-evident insight from the economics pro- fession known as the marginal utility hypothesi s. As people get more and mo re of som ething—whatever it i s—each additional unit is of less and less value. ( In the case of calories, information, and heroin—after a certain poi nt, additions are not only worthless, they are less than worthless.) An extra dollar means less to a billionaire than it does to a pauper. This is an- other way of saying that the loss of an additional dollar is of lesser conse- quence than the loss of a man’s last dollar. This is obvious when it is reduced to the extreme situation—where a man only has a single dollar. If he loses it, he will go hungry. But if a billionaire fails to make an addi- tional dollar, it will not even be noticed. This means that a speculation with 50/50 odds is inhe rently sensel ess—but people make worse specula- tions all the time.

That these marginal, 50-som ething inv estors will panic out of stocks seems a foregone conclusion. Will they panic out of hous es, too, and out of the habit of consumption? When Americans begin saving like the Japanese, should it surprise us if the U.S. economy also turns a little Japanese? Who would believe it? Japan’s problem is that its people do not con- sume enough. America’s problem is just the opposite. We are too good at it. We consume with our eyes shut. We’re the best consumers in the entire worl d. When it comes to buying things we don’t need with money we don’t have—no oth er nation comes close. If only consumption could make you rich! Who wants to hear it? Do n’t waste your time telling your neighbor that rising house prices won’t ma ke him rich. You might as well tell him that his wife is fat; he’s proba- bly already noticed and won’t appreciate the observation in any case. Besid es, pr operty prices are still rising. Who’s going to believe he is getting p oorer when his house is rising at 20 percent per year? And when he gets so muc h money without working for it, it is hardly surprising that he spends it. Easy come; easy go. Americans f lock to luxury. But there are signs that the trend is nearing an end. Rental vacancies reached 10 percent in April 2005—a record high. This has cut rental in- come to the point where the price-earnings ratio (P/E) of houses (average selling price divided by 12-month rental income) has risen to 34, higher than the P/E of stocks at the bubble peak in 2000. Another way to look at it is that ren tal income aver aged about 5 percent of house prices in the 1990s. By 2004, the number had dropped to 3.5 percent. WHAT ABOUT INFLATION? In the early 2000s, the U.S. mon etary base expanded at the f astest rate in 30 years; it rose 20 percent or more in 2003 and 2004. Why was the mon ey supply increasing so rapidly? It was the work of the U.S. central bank, which was desperate to avoid a long, def lationary Japan-style slump. So far, it has avoided the slump, but at the price of creating a bubble in the ent ire U.S. economy—centered around resi dential real est ate.

Tw enty percent per yea r—equal to the increase in the money supply. The phenomenon is not limited to the United States. Real estate bub- bles have been spotted all over the world. And money suppl ies also are bub bling up—particularly in Asia. What happens is this: U.S. consumers spend more than they can afford buying Asian-made goods. This leaves billions of extra dollars in the hands of Asian exporters. They deposit the mon ey in their central banks, who convert it to local currency—thus rais- ing their own money supply. The U.S. is exporting inf lation, say econo- mist s, and importing def lation ( low-priced goods). If this news had come out in the 1970s, things would have been dif- ferent. The “bond vigilantes” would have seen the rising money supply figures and panicked. They would have dumped bonds. Yields would have soared. All of a sudden, mortgage rates would have spiked up and the hou sing bubble would have been over. But now, no one pays much atten- tion to the money supply f igures. Now, ever yone knows what no one knew or wou ld have bel ieved 30 years ago—that central banks can create as much money as they want without causing consumer price inf lation. We understand the mechanics of how the Fed’s inf lation of the money supply ends up in central banks in Asia. We also understand how this wo rks to suppress consumer prices in America and reduces its long-term comp etitiveness. The unbalanced trade between the United States and Asia leaves huge amounts of money in Asian hands. Much of it is invested in new facto ries and plants in Asia, which is inherently def lationary, since this poli cy increases production capacity and the quantity of goods that mon ey chases. Low consumer price increases in the United States permit- ted the Fed to hold down lending rates lower and longer than would have otherwise been possible. This, in turn, gave speculators and house buyers the credit they n eeded for the residential real est ate boom. In our previous book, we argued that Japan-style def lation was a greater risk than consumer price inf lation. Prices have been falling, off and on, for the past 10 years in Japan. Not that the government and the cent ral bank have not tried to stop it. But prices are harder to control than econ omists pret end. Prices typically rise when the Fed reduces in- terest rates. Credit is more affordable, so people buy more. On the other hand, buying decreases when the Fed raises rates, for the obvious and in- verse reason that things f inanced on credit are more expensive.

This is what happe ned in Japan. Despite a heroic effort by the Bank of Japan to de- stroy its own currency, from 1995 to 2005 the yen became more valu- able. Domestic prices fell in Japan. The central bank cut rates down to zero. Still, who would want to borrow when prices were falling? Each year, th e currency became more valuable; borrowers would have to pay bac k loan s with more expensive money. Who would want to buy any- thi ng wh en he knew he cou ld get it cheaper in a few months? And who wou ld want to invest in new plant and equipment when the prices of his product were actually falling? The Bank of Japan could offer all the credit it wanted. There were few takers. Co uld that happen in America? Yes, it could. Could the United States suffer a long, slow, soft slump like the Japanese—as we forecast in our last boo k? Yes, but there is a big difference between the United States and Japan. The United States is an empire of de bt. Japan was a republic of credit. The Japanese never stopped saving. They never stopped making things. If they had a fault, it was the same fault that the Chinese have now—they made too much. While Americans underinvest in productive capacity, the Japanese overinvested. They had so much capacity, the world’s consumers could no t keep up with it. The Japanese went bust with the rest of the world owing them a lot of money. And every year since, even through the dark est years of their re- cession, the Japanese trade balance was positive. The United States is a very diffe rent story. We have elaborated it in thi s book—the story of an empire of self-delusion and f lattery. America can have a soft, slow slump, but not a long one. It can’t afford it. Let u simaginefora mom ent that the U.S. stock market did fall as muc ha sJapan’s—not just the Nasdaq, which has tracked the Nikkei Dow rather closely—but all U.S. stocks.

Down at the bedrock es sentials of what really is happening, we can build and work our way up out of the mist, to the heights where the air is clear and we might actually see something. For the problem that most investors face is that they do not see Wall Street for what it really is, but as a mirage that changes shape depending on what theory you use to look at it. “W here you stand depends on where you sit,” it is said. If you sit on the boa rd of General Motors or another major cash-hungry corporation, your stand on Wall Street is fairly obvious: It is a worthy and necessary ally. If you sit in an off ice of Goldman Sachs or Merrill Lynch, or in any other off ice of the f inancial industry, you are sure to view Wall Street as a genero us and benevolent employ er; it puts your children through private school and pays for your house in the Hamptons. And if you are the typi- cal investor, you are likely to look on your Wall Street professional as though he were the family doctor; he provid es a necessary and helpful ser- vice. Like a doctor, he is a phone call away, ready to f ly to your aid and comfort. He even wears a tie and drives a nice car. He is a professional. He is th ere to help. Yo u a r e not wrong; he provides a valu able service. But before you send a thank-you note, you should realize: The man is pr obably a quack. Me dicine is a science, of sorts. Progress is cumulative. Over the years, doctors have learned what works and, more often, what doesn’t. Give a patient enough strychnin e and he is unlikely to pay his bill. Gradually, doctors learned not to do it. Even a bad doctor has at his f ingertips the re- sults of thousands of years of trial and error, including a few years of real scientif ic research and observation. He can still make a mess of things; but ther e is no reason why he should, except for simp le incompetence or a di- abolica l urge.

It is easy, the brokers tell you in the ads; all you have to do is buy some stocks. Of course, Wall Street is eager to sell stocks to you. And, presto, you’re just like Warren Buffett. See how easy it is to get rich! But you don’t get rich by buying stocks; you get rich by buying com- panies at good prices, holding them for a long time, and not spending your money. In this regard, Wall Street is not a friend, it is an enemy. And so is, by the w ay, the Securiti es and Exchange Commission (SEC). The fraud perpetrated by Wall Street and the SEC is that mom-and-pop investors are on the same level playing f ield as real investors. It is just not true. The in- siders know vastly more than the average investor and so does Wall Street. Do you think Wall Street’s insiders would sell a stock if they thought it was going up? Of course not; they sell stock because they know they make mo re mon ey on commissions—buying and selling for customers—than they are likely to make from the stocks. They are like the owners of casi- nos. The owners of any Las Vegas glitter-hole could pull the levers on their slot machines if they wanted to do so. They don’t. Because they know they will make more money by letting the customers win from time to time so they will keep playing and hoping that they will turn out to be big winners. Ultimately, it’s the House that wins, not the players. AN INSIDER’S GAME A corporate insider has a huge advantage. Like Warren Buffett, he invests in public markets, but with the close, detailed information of someone running a private business. He doesn’t get his information from the news- paper—but from his own eyes and ears, his own balance sheets and inven- tory reports, and his own sales numbers. He is someone who really knows som ething. He is not out to improve the world. He is o nly interested in improving his own world. He is sometimes right and sometimes wrong, but at least he acts on the basis of real information, not public babble. Wa ll Street’s great pretense is a ided and abetted by academic econo- mists who maintain that the market is always correct. The market always knows all there is to know about a stock, they say. This delightful con is known as the efficient market hypothesis ( EMH). Whatever price the market sets, they say, is the right on e. So whether you are Warren Buffett"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"The Wall Street Fandango 311 or a b us driver, you will always buy at the “perfect” price. And since the price will be correct—no matter what it is—you don’t have to worry abo ut how high prices go. Just buy! And then buy some more! Wall Street loves it. The SEC encourages it—with the preposterous insight that all in- vestors are created equal and endowed with the same right to buy stocks at the market price! He re again, the comparative conceits of modern democracy and mod- ern investment markets are too amusing not to point out. In the short run, says Warren Buffett, the stock market is a voting machine. In the long run, it is a weighing machine. In the short run, the “voters” decide how muc h to pay for a stock. The price they choose is perfect say EMH dream- ers, because they know all there is to know. There is no other means of val uing a stock. There is no higher authority than Mr. Market. So, the bus driver or public prosecutor can buy any stock he pleases, at any price Mr. Market sets, convinced that he is as smart as Warren Buffett. Back in the days when royal families ruled Europe, a monarch might do a good job of ruling his kingdom or a bad one. If he bungled the job, he wou ld have to face his nobles, his people, and ultimately, his God. If his mistak es were egregious enough, he cou ld lose his kingdom, his head, or his soul. The lumpen democrat, like the lumpen investor, faces no such check. He bel ieves he can make no mistake, because there is no higher authority. Whatever he wants, whatever he thinks, whatever crosses his mind—there is nothing an d no one to tell him he is a fool. If 51 percent of voters want som ething, who can say they are “wrong,” even if what they want is sor- did and revolting? If the majority of stock buyers decide to pay 200 times earnings for a tech stock, that, too, must be the correct price, right? Both concepts—democracy and the eff icient market hypothesis—are empty. They only tell us that the mob gets what it want s—in the near term. Longer term, the mob ge ts what it has coming. Re al capitalists are not mob inv estors.

During the entire period—from the f inal years of the great tech bubble through the bear market and recession—followed by the ral ly in the stock market and economic recovery, people who knew what they were doing were selling stocks. Insiders sometimes buy and sometimes sell. They have a tendency to sell. Corporate shares are often a form of compensation, which must be sold to be realized.

But though the f igures have a bias toward the short side, trackers had rarely seen such an eager- ness on the part of corporate insiders to get rid of their shares, nor such a reluctance to buy more, as they saw in 2004 and 2005. And by January 2005, insiders practically stopped buying altogether. The total of insider purchases was only $34.1 million—the lowest number in 12 years.

As an investor, you could study the company you work for or visit one that is looking for investors. Public information is little more than the amplif ied sentiments of the crowd. In broad terms, the crowd of investors is either fearful or greedy. Actual ne ws items are interpreted to give the lumpen the interpretation they want. At the crescendo of a bubble, almost every cursed event is bull- ish, as was the war against Iraq in 2003, and the hurricanes that hit Florida in 2004. Bullish sentiment ran so high for so long, even the impact of a giant me teor would have been taken as a good omen. In January 2005, in- vestment advisors were still bullish by a two-to-one margin after the longest stretch of bullishness ever recorded. During the same period, in- siders—private investors, with private and indepen dent knowledge—had been extremely bearish on their shar es. Not only did the insiders buy lit- tle of their own stock, they sold a lot of it—$1.9 billion worth. For every share they bought, in other words, they sold 55. We don’t know if that is a record, but it must be close to one. In bull markets, your stocks will go up. In bear markets, they will go down. Every transaction will be clipped by brokers and intermediaries. If you put your money in a mutual fund, a hedge fund, or with professional managers, you will pay additional fees. Some poor souls pay stockbrokers and mana ger s to help them place their mon ey in funds of funds...or even funds of funds of funds. This style of investing almost guarantees losses. It makes time work against you, like staying at the slot machines long after being ahead. Over time, you are practically guaranteed to give bac k any gains—either in the next bear market or simply in management fees and other charges. ’TIL DEATH DO US PART Don ’t ever get married to your investments, say the experts.

We o nly bring this up to compare our own antique style of investing with today’s one-night-stand investment world. People don’t seem to be lieve in marriage anymore. When the going gets rough, investors get going somewhere else. Or, people merely think they can have more fun by fooling around. Nobody buys a house expecting to live with it forever. Nor do th ey buy stocks and houses with the intention of having them and hol ding them until they are parted by death. Instead, they f lip them— changing assets nearly as often as they change their pants. Almost nobody buys a stock for the dividends—few stocks have any to speak of. Nor do they buy a house merely as a place to live. Instead, they ke ep moving from one thing to the next hoping to get rich on cap- ital gains. If only it were true! If only making mon ey were as easy as “wham, bam, thank you ma’am.” Alas, you do not, generally, make mon ey overnight. Instead, you make money by investing patiently and faithfully. Your money needs time to work; it must get together with resources, expertise, and opportunity. They have to get to know each other. They have to make plans and exe- cute them. If you’re lucky, the project will eventually work out and you’ll get a decent return on your investment. But it can take years. Warren Buf- fett says the ideal holding period for a stock is forever. That sounds like an exaggeration to us. Forever is a long time. And since ever ything degrades, everything di es, ever ything goes awa y—including the best companies ever created—forever might be a tad too long. But this is only a theoretical problem. In practice, you will expire, or your investments will, long be- fore fore ver comes. Even houses take a long time to pay off. The stream of revenue from a house is the utility of living in it over time. That is why it makes sense to buy a house that you will want to live in for a very long time. You will be able to afford to f ix it up, plant trees and a garden, and amortize the house an d improv ements over many years. Yo u m a y s ay, yes, but house prices are soaring.

When we were young, we were a lot smarter. But as the years go by, ma ny of the things we thought were smart don’t seem so smart anymore. And now we realize that no matter how smart we think we are, we are never quite smart enough. We think stocks are going up, we think we can build a better world in Mesopotamia, we think we can tell the fellow down the street how to discipline his children or decorate his house. But what do we know? It is easier to be smart than to be good; that’s why there are so many smart people, and so few good ones. Smart men get electe d to high off ice. They run major corporations. They write editorials for the newspaper. Pity the poor good man; he goes to parties and has nothing to say that is not mocking and cynical.

THE ESSENTIAL INVESTOR The word essentialism has been used to describe other crackpot strains of philosophy. But no one had a good grip on it, so we took it for ourselves. Altho ugh it is a creed derived from stud ying the markets, it applies to the rest of life. At the foundation of essentialism is ignorance, not knowle dge. Igno- rance rules the world of f inance. It also rules the rest of the world. You can never know whether a given action will produce benef icial results; you can never know whether a stock will go up or down. You don’t know what the price of oil will be in the next hour, let alone the next 10 years. You do not know wh eth er General Motors will be in business in 10 years’ time. You do not know much about the past, little about the pre sent, and nothing about th e fu ture. What do you do when you know so little? You become very modest. Yo u turn to the essentia ls. You focus on what you do know and what you can control. You follow the rules. Essentialism vener ates humility as its highest virtue. Your authors are so humble, we are practically arrogant about it. No one is more humble than we are. But the humble recognition of your own ignorance still leaves you with decisions to make. How do you make them? We l l, you turn to the essential rul es—the traditions, the lessons of his- tory, the distilled wisdom of generations of dead people. In the investment wo rld, you “buy low, sell high.” That is what has always worked for in- vestors. Buying high and hoping to sell higher is another game—specula- tion. If you think you might enjoy it, do go ahead, dear reader. But it is not real ly investing. Wa rren Buffett, an essentialist inv estor, says you should buy “great comp anies at fair prices.” We don’t disagree. Of course, it is hard work to"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"Subversive Investing 319 find them. But there you are: another essential insig ht—you don’t get som ething for nothing. Yo u generally get what you deserve from the markets, not what you expect. Following the rules, working hard with patience and discipline will usually get you a decent result. Reckless speculation, overspending, and fre- netic trading, on the other hand, generally give investors what they have coming—good and hard. Som ewh ere in the still-unwritten Essentialist’s Handbook, it warns reade rs that they “cannot be too trusting in private or too cynical in pub- lic.” Essentialists make priv ate life paramount. They “sweep their own door steps,” as Goethe put it, hoping to make the whole world clean. They are not empire builders, at l east, not public empire builders. In stead, they build their own private little empir es, constructed with the voluntary help of others and a great deal of luck. Es sentialists do not take themselves too seriously. They mind their own business; they do their best. They read the newspapers only to gawk and giggle. They do not particularly care if their investments go down. For, if they do the right thing—if they do their best—they recognize that the out come is not up to them. In business and investment, es sentialists operate on the basis of private knowle dge, not public kno wle dge. They buy companies, not stocks. They trade on the basis of in sid er information, not public information. They buy assets at good prices, not outrageous ones. They purchase stocks at low p/e ratios (price to earnings)—between 5 and 10. Let the public in- vestor buy stocks over 15 p/e. Es sentialists turn off the TV, they trust their own eyes and ears, their own experiences, and the reasoning power of their own brains. But they trust even their own brains only so far. They know that they are just like ever yone else —easily swayed by emotion and easily inf luenced by mass sentiments. It is not grandiose. It is not messianic. Nor is it guaranteed to work miracles. But at least it doesn’t make things worse, and it will leave your money and dignity intact. THE MYTH OF CAPITAL GAINS Capital gains in housing and stocks is a fraud.

A house cannot go up in value. It can only go up in price. But what about other investments? Suppose stocks doubled in value? Or bonds? Or gold coins? What difference would it make? Here again, we loo k into the mists and fog that surround the extraordinary popular delu- sions of our time—and we f ind the most remarkable shapes! Millions of investors, fund managers, analysts, brokers, strategists, speculators, and gamblers all over the world sweat and strain, day after day, to try to f ind investments that will go up in price. But what difference does it make? None. Of course, it makes a difference individually, privately, and person- ally. If you have a collection of rag dol ls and then have the good fortune to find that rag dolls have become all the rage, with rag doll prices doubling every year , well bravo for you. People gi ve you more money for your rag dolls. Mon ey has moved from someone else’s hands to yours. Yo u a r e r icher . The person who bought the rag dolls f igures he is no poor er—he has merely exchanged one form of we alth for another. But so have you. Now he owns rag dolls instead of dollars. He even believes the rag dol ls will bring him more wealth, for they are going up in price. You on the oth er hand, have given up the wealth-building rag dolls in return for the paper dollars. Ta ken as a group, buyers and sellers included, nothing has changed. People still have exact ly the same number of rag dolls and the same amount of money. All that has happened on a macroeconomic level is that preferences have changed; people now prefer rag dolls to the other things mon ey can buy. Overall, they are not a penny richer. They have merely moved money from one pocket to another. Bond s, gold, real estate. All are about the same. An increase in the price does not make people, generally, richer. It makes a few people rela- tively richer—which is all they care about. But all these transactions in- volve no thing more than movi ng money around; a people as a whole—or thea verage investor—cannot expect to get rich by investing in them. They are only means of saving money or putting it to use. A bond is noth- ing more than a loan that should come back with interest. The interest is a real gain; it makes the lender richer.

Stocks also are different. They are a claim on a share of a company’s in- come. If the company ’s income goes up, so does the real value of the stock. What happens, though, when the company does not earn more money? What happens when stocks go up anyway? What happens when the stock mar ket rises, when investors “vote” for higher share prices? Don’t they all get richer, as the stock market rises? Well, yes and no. They are richer, compared with nonholders of stock. Soc iety has me rely switched its prefer- ences, just as it did in the case of rag dolls. On a macrolevel taking every- one together, they have gained not a single sou. Since stocks and real estate are so widely held, an increase in prices spreads throughout the entire society, like consumer price inf lation, so the average home owner or stockholder is not much better off. He can sell his stocks at a prof it, but he has to buy others back at higher prices. Likewise, he can sell his house for more than he paid for it, but he still will need a place to live. And it will cost him more money. There is no particular reason why one generation would want to pay $5 for $1 worth of earnings and the next pay as much as $30. These pref- erences shift—just as voter preferences shift. Sometimes, voters are expan- sive and bullish. Other times, they are fearful and gloomy. The history of the sto ck market is one of long shifts in sentiment that run up capital gains over a period of 15 to 20 years and then run them down again. In the 1930s and 1940s, investors could have bought a stock for 5 to 10 times earnings. In the 1960s, they would have paid twice to three times the price. Then, in the 1970s, sentiment shifted ag ain. Investors weighed the risks and rewards and voted for lower pric es. By the late 1980s, stocks we re selling for 5 to 10 times earnings again. Then, they shifted again. Capital gains were back in style, with prices rising over the next 18 years, to the point where investors paid 20 to 30 times earnings and believed that capital gains were forever, not for just a cycle. Capital gains come. And go. They do not make society richer, only the people who happen to get them, and then only if they are smart enough to sell at the very moment when they have become most con- vinced th at the gains will go on eternally."},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"324 TH E ESSENTIAL INVESTOR SUBVERSIVE INVESTING An investor who follows the crowd and gives in to the collective mood of the market cannot expect to make any money. For he will o nly get what everyone else gets. Only the contrarian who subverts the will of the mob and goes against the prevailing mood can hope to make any money. Some how, the markets always have to surprise us. If they did not, what would be the point of having them? People trade assets because one bel ieves they will go up, the other believes they will go down. At least half of the traders must be surprised. Besides, if they all knew what would happe n, they would never have to trade, bargain, or take a risk. Th e more people all come to believe the same thing, the more they must all be surprised, because as they become more and more sure of them selves, they tilt the odds against themselves. The person on the other side then has an edge. It is a bit like pari-mutuel betting at a horse race. Whatever horse is going to win is going to win. You can’t know wh ich. So the payoff, over time, is not in the horse—it in the odds. The favorite pays off most handsomely when he is least favored; that is, when the most people are surprised to see him in the winner’s circle. When he is favored out of proportion to his real chances of winning, you are bet- ter off putting your money on anot her nag even if you believe the fa- vorite will win. The more people stand to be surprised by a given turn in the market, the more the contrarian investor stands to make money. Not that he has a copy of tomorrow’s Wall Street Journal under his arm. Nor can he read the future in the stars. He is merely a better judge of his fellow man. He knows that when men get together they tend to amplify and reinforce each other’s sentiments and tilt the odds. The polls show that both the pros and the amateur investors are cur- rent ly overwhelmingly bullish. This is a feeling, not a thought. They can give you all the r easons stocks should go up. On the other hand, the man with a bearish feeling will have his own reasons—just as good and just as many. The reasons balance themselves out; it is feelings that move the mar ket.

The crowd can do no real thinking or real analysis. It has no private, insider information. It is not because of logical, objective reasoning that the mob of investors deems a stock worth 10 times earnings one day and 20 times earnings two years later. Nor does logical reasoning lead one generation to favor a repub lican form of government while the next happily consents to a dic- tato r or an empire. The natural inclination is to simplify and exaggerate the prevailing mo od by pressuring people to conform to it. This creates circumstances in wh ich the favorite horse, favorite stock, or preferred political outcome is greatly overbought. The opportunity then, lies disproportionately on the other side of the trade, where only subversive contrarians can take advan- tage of it. In no f ield of human activity is contrarian thinking less wel come or mo re subversive as in warfare. When a troop of cavalry attacks, it must do so in unison. Every man must give up his own thoughts—even thoughts of his own survival—to lend weight to the collective action and give it a hope of success. If he malingers or holds back, he may increase his own chance of survival, but he weakens the force of the assault. This is why cowa rdice or dereliction is so severely punished in wartime. At Stalingrad, in World War II, when Marshal Chuikov came to take charge of the de- fenses, one of his f irst actions (at least so it has been reported ) was to line up a company of soldiers who had performed badly in a recent battle and have every tenth man shot. The ancient tradition of “decimation” had not been used since the Roman era. In a letter to his family, a French soldier in World War I told how his group had been ordered “over the top” in what they all realized was a hopeless mission. They were to attack German trenches, across a “No ma n’s land.” Between them and the Germans was a stout emplacement of barbed wire. From bitter experience, the French knew they wouldn’t ma ke it beyond the barbed wire. Th e off icers sent desperate messa ges to their commanders, informing them of the hopelessness of their situation. They asked for clarif ication and conf irmation: Did they really mean for them to attack? But the an- swer came back in the aff irmative. The men did not protest. They did not mu tiny. Instead, they wrote farewell letters to their families—and went to their deaths as or dered."},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"326 TH E ESSENTIAL INVESTOR The contrarian solider would have tried to save himself. He would have feigned a wound. He might have lingered in the trenches. He might have given himself a real wound—but not a deadly one—to avoid combat. Re latively few did so—even though it was the only choice rational self- interest might have offered him. In World War I, bullet wounds to the hand became popular. “You’ve got a ticket home,” soldiers said to their friends who were lucky enough to get shot in the hand. Everyone was jealous of the man who got to go bac k to his private life with his honor, his wits, and his body more or less intact. But after a while, a nyone with a wounded hand was suspected of doing it to himself. Doctors inspected for powder burns. If they found evidence of a self-administered wound, the poor man would be exe- cuted. Then, inventive soldiers found they could get the enemy to inf lict the wound simply by holding a lit cigarette above the trench at night. Wa rs are tragic examples of collective action: Defection is considered disgraceful and dishonorable; the punishment is death. Markets, on the other hand, are comedi es; you can say goodbye to the trenches any time.

TH E POWER OF GOLD Mr. James Surowiecki wrote a wise and moronic piece on gold in the New Yorker. His wisdom is centered on the insight that neither gold, nor paper mon ey are true wealth, but only relative measures, subject to adjustment. “Gold or not, we’re always just running on air,” he wrote. “You can’t be rich unless ever yone agrees you’re rich.” 1 In other words, there is no law that guarantees gold at $450 an ounce. It might just as well be priced at $266 an ounce, as it was when George W. Bush took off ice for th e f irst time. Since then, a man who counted his wea lth in Kruggerands has become 70 percent richer. But gold wasn’t born yesterday, or four years ago. Mr. Surowiecki no- ticed that the metal has a p ast, just as it has a pre sent. He turned his head around and looked back a quarter of a century. The yellow m etal was not"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"Subversive Investing 327 a great way to preserve wealth during that period, he notes. As a result, he sees no difference between a paper dollar and a gold doubloon, or between a bull market in gold and a bubble in technology shares. “In the end, our trust in gold is no diffe rent from our tr ust in a piece of paper with ‘one dollar’ written on it,” he believes. And when you buy gold, “you’re buying into a collective hallucination—exactly what those dot-com investors did in the late nineties.” Pity he did not bother to look back a little further. This is the mo- ronic part. While Mr. Surowiecki looked at a bit of gold’s past, he did not see enough of it. Both gold and paper dollars have histories, but gold has far more. Both gold and dollars have a future. But, and this is the impor- tant part, gold is likely to have more of that, too. The expression, “as rich as Croesus,” is of anc ient orig in. The king of historic Lydia is remembered, even today, for his great we alth. Croesus was not rich because he had stacks of dollar bills. Instead, he measured his rich- ness in gold. No one says “as poor as Croesus.” We have also heard the ex- pression, “not worth a Continental,” referring to America’s paper money during the Revolutionary War era. We have never heard the expression, “not worth a Kruggerand.” Likewise, when Jesus said, “Render unto Caesar that which is Cae- sar’s,” he referred to a denarius, a coin of gold or silver, not a paper cur- rency. The coin had Caesar’s image on it, just as today’s American money has a picture of Lincoln, Washington, or Jackson on it. Dead presi dents we re golden back then. Even today, a gold denar ius is still about as valu- able as it was when Caesar conquered Gaul. America’s dead presi dents, wh ose images are printed in green ink on special paper, lose 2 percent to 5 percent of their purchasing power every year. What do you think they will be worth 2,000 years from now? A few years before Jesus, Crassus, who had made his fortune on real estate speculation in Rome, dec ided to put together an army to hustle the east. Alas, such projects almost always meet with disaster; the att empt by Crassus was no exception. He was captured by the Parthians and was put to death in an unusually cruel and costly way. He did not end his days with paper money stuffed down his throat, and certainly not dollar bills. No, they poured molten gold down his gullet—or so the story has it. Gold has a long history.

Gold is hard to f ind and hard to bring up out of the earth. By its nature, the quantity of gold is always limited. Paper money, by contr ast, offers irresistible possibilities. The list of bright paper rivals is long and colorful. You will f ind hundreds of exam- ples, from assignats to zlotys, and from imperial purple to beer suds brown. But the story of paper money is sh ort and predictabl e. Since the in- vent ion of the printing press, a new paper dollar or franc can be brought out at negligible cost. Nor does it cost much to increase the money supply by a factor of 10 or 100 —simply add zeros. It may seem obvio us, but adding zeros does not add value. Still, the attraction of being able to get something for nothing has al- ways been too gr eat to resist. That is what makes goldbugs so irritating: They are always pointing it out. Even worse, they seem to enjoy saying “T here ain’t no such thing as a free lunch,” which comes as a big disap- poi ntment to most people. Once people were able to create money at virtually no expense, no one ever resisted doing it to excess. No paper currency has ever held its value for very long. Most are ruined within a few years. Some take longer. Even the world’s two most successful paper currencies—the American dollar and the British pound—have each lost more than 95 percent of their value in the past century, which is especially remarkable since both were linked by law and custom to gold for most of those years. For the dollar, the f inal link to gold was severed only 34 years ago. Some paper currencies are destroyed almost ab sentmindedly. Others are ruined intentionally. But all go away eventually. By contrast, every gold coin that was ever struck is still valuable today, most have more real value than when they f irst came out of the mint. Cent ralbankers reported in early 2005 that 70 percent of them were increasing their reserves of euros.

It is mon ey that no central bank pro- mo tes and none destroys. It is mon ey that exists only in a tangible form, a real metal—a number on the periodic table. “Gold goes up and do wn, just like other kinds of money,” say economists.

No r will gold cure baldness or add inches to your most private part. Even as money, gold may not be perfe ct. But it is better money th an any- thing else. Gold was around millions of years before the U.S. dollar was in- vented. It will probably be around a billion years after. This longevity is not in itself a great recommendation. It is like buying a suit that will last longer than you do; there is no point to it. But the reason for gold’s longevity is also the reason for its great virtue as mon ey: It is inert; it yield s neither to technology nor to vanity. The world improvers will always be with us. They will spend more than they have, boss other people around, and generally make the world a wo rse place to live. They will offer proposals like those of Thomas L. Friedman. The nice thing about gold is that it is so unresponsive. It nei- ther laughs nor applauds. Gold is money that no central bank promotes and none destroys. Pap er money is a handy tool for the world improvers. They use it like pol iticians use civil service jobs and generals use heavy bombers—to get their way. Whatev er the vapid ideal du jour, it takes money to pursue it. Given enough money, the poor can be fed and housed. The middle classes can be given free medical care and low-cost loans for houses. The upper classes can be given contracts and favors. Enemies can be sum moned up, bombed, and reconstructed. Bread, circuses, war—the imperial program costs money. Ho w to get more money for these great new programs, these mar- velo usly worthwhile ideals, these fabulous public spectacles?

Instead, it stays as mute and reticent as a dead man in front of a television. No mat ter how persua- sive the advertising, the m an is not going to go for it. Paper money, on the other hand, barely needs encouragement. Start up the presses! Lower the interest rate! Relax reserve requirements and lending standards! Sell more bonds! Create more paper! Paper money is re ady to go along with anyth ing. Lik e George W. Bush, it never met a boondoggle it didn’t like. Sooner or later, it ends up as worthless as the projects it was meant to pay for. Gold is merely the subversive investor’s way of protecting himself. SPECULATIONS Is. Was. Will be again. If things remained the same, there would be no need for verb tenses. But things do not remain the same, they change. After a long while of remaining the same, investors begin to under- price change. A speculator can make mon ey by betting against the present tense. But not always, not when the pre sent tense o nly came into being re- cent ly. For that case, investors still price things based on the past. But after a long spell, investors begin to believe that that which is will be forever. They make their bets on a false premise by underpricing risk, underpric- ing change, and overpricing stability. Everything in l ife has a beginning, a middle, and an end. Each day that passes in which present trends do not come to an end brings us a day closer to the day when they will. “Stability leads to instability,” said economist Hyman Minsky. The longer things remain stable, the more people become convinced that they will never change. As long as the camel’s back doesn’t break, why not heap more straw on it? Tod ay ’s house f lippers are taking riskier and riskier positions—be- cause they are sur e that present trends will not come to an end anytime soon. Instead of buying a house with 20 percent down, they buy one with 10 percent or nothing down. Instead of buying one, they buy two. Instead of buying a modest house, they buy an extravagant one. Instead of living mod estly, they live large, on an imperial scale. But as more and more people make such risky bets, it actually hastens the arrival of what all of them forgot to fear: that something will happen."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"Subversive Investing 331 Rising prices put pr essure on the f inancial system. Interest on loans must be paid. The greater the loans, the greater will be the interest payments. Un less incomes rise, the straw piles on until the camel’s knees begin to wo bble and then break. Th is tendency to overprice the present tense is another way of looking at what Amos Tversky had observed: that investors’ perceptions of risk are overinf luenced by recent history. This leads to a speculative opportunity, for the average investor has come to believe som ething that isn’t true. He has placed his bet inappropriately, unwisely paying too much for stocks and houses in the mistaken assumption that they pose little risk to him. The shrewd speculator has no more idea of whether stocks will go up or down than the naive punter. But he knows that the lumpen have miscal- culated the odds, so he will take the other side of the trade. Naive players ma y be right—maybe prices usually go up. But that is like saying the fa- vorite horse usually wins at the racetrack. It is perhaps true, but not help- ful. For as likely as it is that the favorite horse will win, the odds are still less than 100 percent. He re is another, related error that people make: they look for meaning in things where there is none. We have seen how the homeland people flatter themselves. Why do they rule the earth? They must be better than others. How do they know they are better? Because they are the rulers, they are not the ruled. The group seeks reasons, be yond mere chance, to explain its good fortune. It is smarter. It is racially superior. Its religion, its civilization, its culture—all are thought to be more advanced or more cond ucive to progress. The climate in the homeland is either favorably soft or rigorously harsh. Peop le misapprehend the randomness of events. They see a fund man- ager who has done very well for f ive years in a row and they buy his fund. They don’t realize that his performance may be a feature of randomness— pure cha nce, in other words. Out of a group of thousands of funds, some are going to produce spectacular results. Most likely, the results are noth- ing more than chance, but investors’ misperceptions create a speculative oppo rtunity. It is as if they had watched a group of men f lip a coin. Out of a group of 10 f lippers, one gets heads 10 times in a row. Normally, the odds of getting heads would be only 50/50. But this man, they believe, has a tal- ent for f lipping heads. So, they bet on heads again—not at 50/50 odds, but at 60/40 odds. To win a dollar, they must pony up 60 cents."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"332 TH E ESSENTIAL INVESTOR The shrewd speculator spots his opportunity. He realizes that the man has f lipped heads 10 times in row purely by chance and that his odds of getting heads again are still only 50/50. No one has any idea whether heads will come up, but the clever speculator knows that he must bet against it—because the odds favor him. Over the broad sweep of stock market history, prices have gone up. From barely 100 following the crash of 1929, the Dow is now over 10,000. Who can doubt that the tendency is up? Yet, adjusted for con- sumer price inf lation, the Dow is only about 500, and most of that in- crease is merely cyclical. A dollar of stock market earnings is sometimes judged to be worth only $5 or $6 of capital investment. Other times, in- vestors are willing to pay more than $20. At any particular time, a specu- lato r ma y have no idea whether stocks are headed up or do wn. But he knows that they are likely to overprice the present tense. He knows also that things in nature tend to regress to the mean. After having marched from under 1,000 to over 10,000, from 1982 to 2005, investors have come to believe the tendency is def initely up. Over time, the likelihood that stocks will be relatively cheap or relatively expensive is about 50/50. But today’s naive buyers think they have come ac ross someone who f lips heads every tim e; they expect stocks will become even more expensive than they are now. They have made their bets accordingly, and they are re- f lected in stocks’ current prices. Over the past 100 years, the mean price that investors were willing to pay for $1 of stock market earnings was about $12. Today, investors pay $20 on the S&P 500. They believe prices will go up. They are not wrong. Some time, prices will go up, but investors pay too much for the opportu- nity to f ind out when. A real fat tail event, however, would be more than just a stock market dec line. Prices decline all the time. What happens so rarely that investors tend to forget all about it is a crash. What are the odds of a crash on Wall Street? No one knows, but they are pr obably gr eater than most investors realize. A crash in the stock market would be accompanied by the usual complaints. But a crash in the residential property market would be much worse. Households have come to rely on equity buildup to keep them- selves solvent. Without it, they would have to cut back, reducing con- sumption. This would prod uce al l the negative things the Fed has worked so dishonorably to avoid: recession, job loss, personal bankruptcies, mort- gage foreclosures, and falling prices."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"Subversive Investing 333 We k now the past tense—how America’s empire of debt was built.

Still, it is the sort of thing you want to be prepared for all the tim e. A sensible man may not know the hour or the place of his demise, but he does not doubt that it is coming. If he is smart, he is ready for death any day of the week. So is a sensible investor ready for the day a great em- pire peaks out. He doesn’t know when it will happen.
