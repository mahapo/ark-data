James Robertson, AaronTinney, Andy Tillett, Patricia Gonzalez, Tom Freestone, Billie Spear, and DougMontero—you’re all the best in the business.Special acknowledgment goes to Ken. E. More, my writing partner, and a man whoshould be frustrated with this author, but never is (at least, that’s what heleads me to believe).Finally, to those, like Colin McLaren, who believe the truth is out there andstill worth searching for, and that the role of journalists is akin to that ofthe detective in shining a light on the darkest of crimes or the worst writtenpages of history.—Dylan HowardAUTHORS’ NOTEDiana, Princess of Wales.She was a beauty, icon, mother to the future King of England, and the world’smost photographed woman, tragically killed in a car crash on the night of August31, 1997, speeding through Paris, pursued by a pack of paparazzi. Twenty-twoyears later, the events surrounding the crash are still shrouded in questionsand conspiracy theories abound.On that fateful Parisian night, at the time, both of these authors were livingin the state of Victoria, Australia: Colin, then forty-two, was a policedetective sergeant and task force team leader having worked on many ofAustralia’s worst murders. For three years he went undercover and decimated theCalabrian Mafia in the biggest covert sting in Australian history. His workwould take him on to an independent investigation into the assassination of thethirty-fifth president of the United States, John F. Kennedy, and yieldstartling results.Dylan, back in 1997, then a tender fifteen-year-old, having grown up as anaspiring journalist, was transfixed at the constant media coverage of Diana andthe British royals. He would go on to work in Hollywood as one of the mostfeared journalists in town, having brought down the careers of Mel Gibson,Charlie Sheen, Hulk Hogan, and Paula Deen via explosive stories of misdeeds.Dylan’s sense for scandal and the truth saw him rise to become the undisputedmost powerful gossip editor in the world—and second-in-command to David J.Pecker, chairman and chief executive officer at publishing powerhouse AmericanMedia Inc. As one of the most powerful gossip editors in the world, overseeing avast network of consumer driven magazines, including Us Weekly, OK!, Star, InTouch, Life & Style, Closer, The National Enquirer and its U.K. edition, Globe,the National Examiner, and RadarOnline.comUnbeknownst to each other at the time, these two authors would meet for thefirst time in 2019—during France’s worst heat wave ever—to collaborate on Diana:Case Closed. We were two Australian exports to the wider world with one commongoal in mind: to combine our years of experience reviewing the evidence in thecase of Diana’s death and, together, smash wide open the conspiracy of silencebehind what really happened inside that Parisian tunnel.The result is Diana: Case Solved —a groundbreaking investigation and conclusioninto one of the century’s most gripping conspiracies.Together, after traveling to Paris a combined five times, we bring to an end amystery that has long baffled the world. To create this unflinching account, wehave assembled a global team of investigators—handpicked, high-profile, andutterly meticulous men and women (including retired crime-scene detectives,forensic pathologists, and royal insiders)—to dissect evidence, alibis, andmotives; track down new witnesses; hear Diana’s own voice on secret, long-lostrecordings; and interview key players and those who knew the real Diana best.At the end of this remarkable project, we arrive at some startling newconclusions into the tragic end of the woman they called “the people’sprincess.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------From her first introduction to public life as the painfully shy teenage fiancéeof the heir to the British throne, Prince Charles, through a desperately unhappymarriage, struggles with bulimia, depression, suicide attempts, and multipleaffairs, to finally blossoming into one of the world’s most beautiful andinfluential women, Diana, Princess of Wales, spent her entire adult life underthe media spotlight.Some believe it was precisely this unprecedented global obsession with Diana’severy move that resulted in her death, as the Mercedes S280 in which she was apassenger sped through the Paris streets pursued by a pack of paparazzidesperate for a multimillion-dollar snap of her and (supposed) lover Dodi. Thentheir car spun fatally out of control, slamming into a tunnel alongside theSeine River.But many others believe her death was not an accident.During the course of our real-time investigation, we have meticulously untangledthe strange circumstances and conflicting theories surrounding her death—fromthe wildest conspiracies concerning an eerie pact between senior royals,security services, and global arms dealers, to the official line that chauffeurHenri Paul was a drunk who was irresponsibly speeding. We interviewed newwitnesses who saw the crash and its immediate aftermath…and, crucially, unearththe one man who knows for sure what happened—and who, for twenty-two years, hasbeen ordered to remain silent. He was the keeper of the world’s biggest secretof them all.In Diana: Case Solved, we’ll conduct our own crime-scene analysis, applyingprinciples and procedures the French ignored, laying out the evidence theofficial inquiry missed. We will reveal photographs showing two telling,parallel skid marks at the tunnel entrance adjacent to a merge lane forslower-moving traffic wanting to merge onto the faster Cours Albert roadway. Howwere they caused? And by whom? And why didn’t the French cops see them?We will prove the Mercedes S280 sedan carrying the world’s most famous womancould have only become airborne after hitting a second car and leaving the roadsurface—and staying airborne for a distance of 85 feet.What you are about to read is the eye-opening reality of a secretive,buttoned-up, ultra-elite, and intimidating world of law enforcement—a world withliterally its own rules—where protecting the good name of a nation takesprecedence over all…even a beloved princess.We will also provide the shocking details of how—from the very start—Dianadidn’t fit into the Windsors’ way of doing things, how she was mocked, scornedand resented by her in-laws, and how even her own husband came to consider herlittle more than an irritation.We will lay bare the alarming depths to which Diana was driven by her treatmentat the hands of senior royals and the stark, repeated betrayals of her husband.And we’ll discover how she learned to fight back.Diana: Case Solved will uncover in unprecedented detail just how convenientDiana’s death was to the establishment. We will learn of the secret diaries andrecordings she made, logging the Windsors’ most intimate secrets and hiddenscandals as a desperate kind of insurance policy.We will uncover how the royals were not the only powerful enemies Diana made;her pioneering campaigns against AIDS and land mines drew admiration from thepublic, but enmity from powerful institutions like the international armsindustry, the British and American governments, MI6, and the CIA.This is not simply a retelling of recorded history and a rehashing of existingconspiracy theories.Through our dogged investigative reporting, plus insight and analysis fromexperts and insiders, Diana: Case Solved will, for the first time, paint acomplete picture of why the most famous woman in the world came to meet hertragic end…and how it really happened.Dylan Howard & Colin McLaren“This particular phase in my life is the most dangerous. My husband is planning‘an accident’ in my car, brake failure and serious head injury in order to makethe path clear for him to marry.”LETTER WRITTEN BY D IANA, LATE 1996“Voilà, c’est pour ça je les laisse penser ce qu’ils veulent.”(“That’s why I let them think what they want.”)LE V AN T HANH,DRIVER OF THE MYSTERIOUS WHITE F LAT U NO, SUMMER 2019CHAPTER ONEHad she lived, Princess Diana would have toasted her fifty-eighth birthday onJuly 1, 2019. If she hadn’t succumbed to the catastrophic internal injuriessuffered in her 1997 crash, the world’s most photographed woman would havehosted a glamorous party to celebrate heading toward her big 6–0.Flute of champagne in hand and wearing her Hermès 24, Faubourg perfume, she’dhave been clad in a gown designed to cover up the pink scar that ribboned downher chest—a raised pink remnant of having her chest cracked open by surgeons soher heart could be massaged back to life.She would have laughed with A-list guests, bonded with her sons’ wives, Kate andMeghan, and used the latest iPhone to video her four grandkids playing.It’s the kind of alternative reality that the millions who adored and idolizedDiana can’t help but dwell on—twenty-two years after she died, literallybrokenhearted, on a bloody surgical table at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital. Arip in the left pulmonary vein of Diana’s heart was the fatal injury that endedher short and tormented life, leaving her declared dead by exhausted medics at 4a.m. on August 31, 1997.She survived her black Mercedes S280, registration 688 LTV 75, hurtling into thethirteenth pillar of Paris’s Pont de l’Alma tunnel at a devastating 121 mph. Butshe suffered two heart attacks and, on the way to the hospital, was in suchdistress that she yanked out drips pumping drugs eighty times more powerful thanmorphine into her veins while mumbling indecipherable last words.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Many of the millions who wish “England’s rose” was still alive have spentdecades haunted by the unsettling mysteries that shroud her life and death.For many, there is the feeling that there must be something more to the eventsof that night. That the official story cannot truly be the whole story, and whathappened to Diana has the feeling of something deeper and more harrowing.In this unprecedented investigation, and through groundbreaking forensictestimony, we confirm that these feelings are indeed correct—so correct that thefindings of Diana: Case Solved will renew calls for a fresh inquiry into the carcrash that left three people dead and the entire world reeling.More specifically, we expose an almost unbelievable list of interconnectedplayers who, in their own ways, had a hand in Diana’s demise. And we show thatthe truly remarkable thing about late August 1997 was that Diana survived untilthat date in the first place. Because if many in the circles of power had hadtheir way, she would have been dead long before that.To help establish the real story of August 30 and 31, 1997, I partnered withColin McLaren, famed for his work on the assassination of John F. Kennedy(disproving Lee Harvey Oswald’s “lone-gunman” involvement) and facing down theunderbelly of Australian crime and the Mafia.Most recently, I had presented a case in Fatal Voyage: The Mysterious Death ofNatalie Wood —a podcast series that broke new ground on one of Hollywood’s mostenduring murder mysteries, one involving showbiz icons Robert Wagner andChristopher Walken. All was not as police made you believe. I was humbled thatColin, with his decades of law enforcement experience, found my investigationinto how Natalie, the A-list Hollywood actress, vanished from a yacht followinga brutal argument on November 29, 1981, so compelling that he wanted to join meon another crusade.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------When Diana was pronounced dead at 4 a.m. on August 31, 1997, Colin beganinvestigating the case and undertook his own independent investigations,uncovering startling new facts on the streets of Paris where Diana met her fate.Luckily for us, we still live in a world where a determined, honestinvestigator—willing to go to places where others fear to venture and to ask thequestions others won’t—has the ability to make the kind of powerful, meaningfuldiscoveries that finally shed light on the mysterious dark places that havecaptivated the world for years. That is exactly what we did, traveling to Parisand London in June 2019, our last trip to the City of Light, to finalizeresearch on Diana: Case Solved.As we go chapter by chapter, you’ll read the dual narratives about what weestablished and how we found it, particularly in Colin’s own inimitable voice.Here, then, is the definitive inside story of Diana’s death, life, andsuperhuman heartbreaks, told in her own words and by those who knew her mostintimately. This book reveals the hidden aspects of Diana’s life, from her firstintroduction to the world as a painfully shy nineteen-year-old—a character traitthat was later overcome during her groundbreaking charity work that positivelyimpacted the lives of some of the world’s most vulnerable people—to theill-fated royal slide into addiction. In the end, she found herself corruptedand twisted by those who walk the corridors of power.What’s more, Diana: Case Solved prints Diana’s shocking final conversations thatreveal her most personal thoughts at the end of her life…and what they revealabout the mystery of her fate.Diana died convinced “the firm” was plotting to have her murdered.Heartbreakingly, she also went to her death knowing her last love, Dodi, wascheating on her with an American model. She died with multiple actors, agencies,and even nations working against her. (Perhaps alone, perhaps not.)Come along, then—if you dare—into a world of money, sex, and power, and see howone woman’s elevation into the glamorous universe of royal, celebrity, andunimaginable wealth became a meat grinder that destroyed the young woman who wastruly the darling of the world.CHAPTER TWOPrince Harry appeared to wipe away tears as he and his bride, the American-bornSuits actress Meghan Markle, along with the six hundred guests packed into St.George’s Chapel on the grounds of Windsor Castle on May 19, 2018, sang the lastbars of “Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer.”The hymn was his mother’s favorite, and thirty-three-year-old Harry chose toinclude it as part of the ceremony as a tribute to Diana, twenty-two years afterit was sung at her funeral in Westminster Abbey in 1997. It was thought he criedat his wedding to Meghan purely because of the emotions stirred up by hearingthe hymn again.But we can—now, here—reveal he welled up because he was recalling his mother’swarning to her sons’ future brides to not be “eaten” by the British monarchy andtheir Mafia-like secret wealth streams and strict stranglehold over theirmembers, according to a palace aide.“Harry and William knew their mum died tortured by the treatment she received atthe hands of the royal family, and the last thing Harry wants is for Meghan toendure the same thing,” the source said.Thirty-six years, nine months, and twenty days before Harry said “I do” toMeghan in an unconventionally nonroyal ceremony that would have made his mumproud, Lady Diana walked up the aisle of the ancient St. Paul’s Cathedral inLondon and became Princess Diana. It had all the hallmarks of a fairy-talewedding—but the problems were there almost from the start.“Diana had no experience and was thrust into that world as a nineteen-year-old,”remembered Ken Wharfe, the man who served as her Scotland Yard police protectionofficer.Richard Kay was royal correspondent for the Daily Mail newspaper at thattime—and gained a unique insight into the royal marriage.“Diana, I think, was in love, madly in love with Charles,” he said. He added:But for her, the scales fell from her eyes fairly quickly when she realized thathe was very much set in his ways and he wasn’t going to change.It was an unhappy marriage. They were ill-suited. They barely knew each otherwhen they married. They’d only met on a dozen occasions before they got engaged.In the early days of their relationship, she had to call him, “Sir.” I mean allthese things seem utterly laughable, but we’re only talking about twenty-fiveyears or so ago.The other thing you got to remember, she had married a man who was twelve yearsolder than herself who had vastly different interests. Diana was an extremelyyoung woman when she got married. She never had the kind of normal relationshipsthat young couples have before they marry.I feel there’s sympathy on both sides. It’s hard not to have sympathy for PrinceCharles. He’s married this beautiful young woman. He felt under huge pressure tomarry her, not just from the public, but also from his own father. He made aterrible mistake. The real courageous thing he should have done was to havecalled it off. But he couldn’t do that and he didn’t do that and he’s had tolive with the consequences ever since.Diana had found herself in a gilded cage. Her dashing prince had turned out tobe a rather set-in-his-ways older man with whom she shared almost nothing incommon. Worse, she was not only living with him, but with a whole palace full ofsimilarly stuck-in-the-mud people, too.Recalled Ken Warfe:She was unhappy, and a young woman unable to deal with the fact of being aprincess, without any help from anybody within Buckingham Palace. There was nomanual of how to be a princess, there were no training courses; she was thrustinto this situation and literally had to get on with it.There must have been moments that must have been horrific for her. People hadimagined that Buckingham Palace, Kensington Palace is alive with fire-eaters,jugglers, musicians, but it isn’t.It’s a very lonely place…it’s a pretty lonely existence and I’m sure there’s alot went through Diana’s mind that said, “What am I going to do? What’shappening to me? Where am I going to go? Where will I end up?”But one thing you are giving up is actually your freedom, your right to do whatyou want when you want, but that’s the price you pay—or they pay—for beingroyal.To millions, Diana was living a dream-come-true life—but behind the palacewalls, her loneliness was becoming all-consuming. Half the royal family, itseemed, resented her, and the other half actively disliked her.In November 1981, it was announced that Diana was pregnant. Less than a yearafter she married Charles, she bore him a son, Prince William. Two years afterthat, she gave birth again, to Prince Harry. Charles had done his duty; thesuccession was assured. Now that Diana had provided the so-called “heir and aspare,” her usefulness was effectively over. What followed were to be thedarkest days of Diana’s life.Noted Richard Kay, “She did turn to psychics and alternative healers. They in away sort of filled the void, vacuum, of her empty social life. She didn’t havethat many friends and the people who helped her deal with the stresses andstrains in her life. It’s kind of sad really, when you think this beautifulyoung woman who was adored by the world should have no real close friends. Ittold you a lot about her and it told you a lot about her situation.”In despair, Diana turned her unhappiness on herself: she developed eatingdisorders, starving herself, forcing herself to throw up…and, in one incident,even endangering the life of her then-unborn baby.So, what might have been? How would the royal family—and, indeed, the world—havebeen different if Diana had been able to be physically present and unburdened ofthe crown at the weddings of her sons? What updated advice might she have giventheir brides-to-be?We will never know the answers to these questions with any precision. We areforced to conjecture. Yet, in a way, the circumstances of Diana’s death speakvolumes. Perhaps they speak more loudly than we think.To understand what might have happened at Diana’s end, we have to go back to thebeginning of the mystery for most people. We have to go back to the news of thehorrible accident itself that snuffed out the lives of three people.There is no better guide to take us than Detective McLaren, whose experiencewith the case is unmatched—at least by any investigator who has talked to thepress honestly and openly.Here, Colin begins by taking us intimately close to his very first encounterwith the mystery of the princess and her passing. The horrible emotions Colinfelt upon learning of Diana’s death are, for many of us, all too relatable. Yetdid Colin’s arch-investigator’s eye see things that the rest of us did notsee—or could not bring ourselves to see?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------DETECTIVE’S NOTEBOOKDATELINE: Sunday, August 31, 1997, Melbourne, AustraliaThe rain spat on the tin roof of my partially converted warehouse abode as Ilanguished alone in bed. The night before and far too many boutique beers had mefeeling foggier than a Scottish moor, and my bedraggled body had aches in placesI didn’t think possible. A combination of renovation and celebration had mereeling. Peeping my head over the duvet, I assessed the waiting morning, thelast of what had been a bleak winter in Melbourne, Australia. What littledaylight crept through the sheet I’d tacked over the window offered nothing toinspire, so I rolled over for another five minutes.I was under the weather after a late function the previous night with workcolleagues, for I was a detective with the fifteen-thousand-strong Victoriapolice department. I’d lived a life of detectives and squads, major crimes,kidnappings, drug traffickers, undercover work, violence, and way too manyhomicides. Last night had been a pat on the back with fifty handshakes and toomany investigators recalling crime scenes in between mouthfuls of tapas.The trip down memory lane had transported me back to my early days, cutting myteeth on Melbourne’s underworld and embracing the camaraderie, as cops do. I’dhad a good career, worked some of the country’s worst crimes, and locked away myfair share of rabble. It was what I knew, what I did—and I’d been good at it, sothey said, between beers: investigating and analyzing, unraveling the charcoalmysteries of wrongdoings, working my way up the promotional ladder by hard slog.Finally, I’d been handpicked to head up a national probe into the Mafia and thebombing of the National Crime Authority, a defiant act by the Mafia. By now Istood proud of the number of times I had served as the team leader of taskforces, a tally that was greater than that of any detective nationwide.I mustered my strength, propped myself up on a mountain of pillows, and surveyedthe room. Stacked up, as if waiting my rising, were lengths of timber,plasterboard, trestles, piles of glass bricks, and kilometers of electrical flexconduits. So, I padded to the bathroom, suffered a bracing shower, and donned myoveralls. After working up a sweat hammering the last of the main structuralitems into place, I parked myself on an upturned milk crate and flicked theremote control to my television.Much-liked morning television anchorman Jim Waley flashed to the forefrontlooking earnest and reading an announcement. News footage followed of anunderpass and a twisted Mercedes-Benz being hoisted onto a flatbed tow truck. Animage of Princess Diana was superimposed. I watched, bemused, as the flatbed towtruck bounced along cobblestone streets.I moved closer to the screen, flicked the remote volume up, and listenedopen-mouthed to the words that accompanied the images. A tragedy ofextraordinary proportions, Jim announced, had just transpired in the otherhemisphere. I focused on the television images and began to recognize telltalesigns of one of the world’s most important diplomatic cities. The flatbed towtruck kept bouncing along, as the Mercedes-Benz it carried disappeared into theFrench darkness.Lady Diana Spencer had been holidaying in Paris, I recalled, trying to make thelink. Recent paparazzi snaps of her in a fetching swimsuit had been splashed allover the weekly women’s magazines. Like many others, I admired Diana immensely.And as a man, I thought she was a doll, and a champion of causes close to my ownheart. I paced, unsettled, as the studio backdrop reappeared and the announcercontinued. Two of her male companions in the twisted and mangled Mercedeswreckage were dead; a third, a mess. Diana, the only female, had been pulled outbarely alive and was now fighting desperately for her life.Somehow my hangover didn’t seem all that important anymore.My brain ticked over, struggling to process what I had seen. I made myself astrong macchiato as I surfed other stations for bulletins but found nothing new.I carried my small bedroom television into the main room to join its largercousin. With both television sets tuned to different channels, I picked up mybag of nails and attempted to refocus on the tasks at hand. But any further workdone was lackadaisical at best; for the most part I couldn’t take my eyes offwhat the cameras were showing.Sometime that afternoon came the news that Princess Diana had lost her fight. Itwas then that a seed was sown in my mind, as the television spent time showingreflective footage of her tumultuous life. As a parent, I shuddered at thedreadful shock this would deliver to her two young sons. As a detective, Istarted to wonder, to think.I stayed up for the rest of the night watching the telecast, trying to makesense of the now-death of Princess Diana. Images of a nondescript support pillarin a nondescript tunnel on the Place de l’Alma where the Mercedes had come torest were being televised from every conceivable angle. Television reporterswere camped on the asphalt nearby theorizing everything from a multiple-carcollision to a possible terrorist attack; even the sounds of shots were debated.This crime scene was busier than a discounted retail sale and I feared that itwas rapidly falling into a state of virtual ruination. The French gendarmes weretreating it as they would have any other traffic accident—nothing more, nothingless. No sooner had rescue workers removed the dead and injured than streetsweepers got busy with their hunched backs and piled up vital clues, only todispatch them to the municipal dump. Within hours the thoroughfare was back tobeing a major carriageway with thousands of commuters an hour driving over thesurface, driving over evidence. I wondered what was going through the minds ofthe officers who attended the scene to allow such contamination. Who was incharge? Who made the decision to clear the debris? Broom-swinging workers andemergency service trucks don’t just arrive at 4 a.m. I shook my head, time andagain.One thing I knew was that a crime scene should be treated like a new baby, withgreat care, a fine touch, and meticulous concentration. At the Victoria policedepartment’s detective training school, I lectured trainee detectives on how toapproach a crime scene, how to take charge, and how to work through the clues.There are tried-and-true procedures to follow, principles to be applied whenworking a scene; there rarely is a second chance. Any detective worth his saltknows the perils of trying to garner conclusions from a scene that’s beentampered with, stepped on, swept away, lost, or replaced. I’d taken pride inteaching what to do and what not to do at a crime scene, and the French weregiving a global show-and-tell of how to fuck it up. Frustrated, I switched offboth televisions, carried the smaller back to the bedroom, and turned in. Ipulled the bedcovers up over my head to counter the horror I had watched andattempted a few hours’ sleep.Next morning I made a conscious decision to absent myself from the miseries ofthe world. But inherent curiosity won over; I gave in and turned on the box. Asilent vigil of mourners stood where only twenty-four hours ago there had been acacophony of noisy media, cameras, and emergency crews. Gardens of bouquetsbloomed around the support pillar, forever to be known as number thirteen, onlyto be scattered by fast-moving passing cars. Above this exact spot, on theoverhead roadway atop the tunnel, a shrine was set up by teary pilgrims who hadcome from far and near to mourn a dead Lady. On the news, crosscuts to theprincess’s home in London showed tearful citizens gently laying small bunches ofhandpicked roses among large floral wreaths, colorful notes, and cards of sorrowand despair. Night in both cities failed to succumb to darkness, bathed as theywere in a glow of candles honoring one of the world’s brightest lights nowextinguished. I couldn’t help but be impressed by such compassion, sadness,decency.Over subsequent days I kept waiting for the gendarmes to get down to thebusiness of investigating. But as each successive day came and went with thecrime scene still unvisited by the investigating magistrate, the chances offinding any conclusive answers continued to diminish exponentially with thenumber of vehicles that passed through the tunnel. No one seemed to search foranswers to this tragedy. The French seemed to just ignore it. And with the majorexhibit, the crippled Mercedes, having been jolted a distance of twentykilometers through the streets of Paris without a thought for what might havedislodged along its path, I speculated on whether anything could still be foundintact, if someone qualified and forensically experienced were to go looking.I mused on this idea and then picked up the phone and began to dial my travelagent to cost an airfare to Paris. With the best deal available spelt out and myhand reaching for my Visa card, I stopped short and took stock of what I wascontemplating. Somehow I had found myself in the process of planning a trip toFrance. I placed my ticket on hold and put the phone down. I paced the walls ofmy apartment checking my sanity, wondering if I was a fool or just a frustrateddetective in need of one more hit, one more crime scene. I resolved to give it acouple of days and, if nothing improved, if the French detectives didn’t turnout with their measuring tapes, their cameras, and their notebooks, then Iwould.Each morning I would drive to the largest newsdealer in town, McGillsNewsagency, and purchase a copy of every international paper they had for sale.I was lucky; they carried a fine range of respectable press, including theLondon Times, Telegraph , and the New York Times, among others. They werejournals I could rely on for the accuracy of their content.By midweek I had amassed a small library of newspapers that I had laid out onthe floor of my lounge room. Trestles had been dismantled and pushed aside togain more floor space and plasterboard scraps had become tables. My entire daywas devoted to poring over the latest copy, making notes, studying the printedimage, and channel surfing the news services. The world’s foremostcorrespondents kept feeding me tidbits, acting as my briefing paper, keeping meabreast of the latest developments. I had put my head fat in the middle of thisriddle and, truth be told, I was enjoying every minute. I ached for more.Having gotten a good handle on the collision and deaths, I started to ponderwhat had actually occurred. At the least, it was a most serious road accident;at worst, a multiple homicide. On every level this inquiry screamed to beapproached with the utmost professionalism. With a proliferation of consulatesand embassies, one would expect Paris to boast a police force poised to dealpromptly and proficiently with a situation resulting in misfortune to a visitingdignitary, government head, or official guest. The world was watching, moreintently than for any other televised event in history. This level of globalscrutiny should have had a police department rallying, pulling out all stops toshowcase their detecting skills. My initial outrage at the inaction of theFrench constabulary was mellowing into an unsettled reality.I scanned my sea of newspapers, fine-tuning my mind’s eye. Stepping,metaphorically speaking, back into the tunnel, I revisited pillar thirteen as itwould have appeared that night. I put myself in the shoes of the investigatorson site to consider what they confronted. The first in attendance at the crashwould have been uniformed officers whose principal duty was to render assistanceto the injured and call for ambulances. The magnitude of this particularincident would certainly have directed a second call to police headquarters,requesting the attendance of more cops and investigators. As in any major cityin the world, a team of skilled detectives, well-versed in issues of diplomacyand protocol, would have been working late shift. It goes without saying thatwhen these officers reached the entrance to the tunnel they would have sensed achallenge. In those initial few seconds, when you approach something reallydire, you take a deep breath. You breathe it in and let it out as you walkforward to take charge.A large crowd had already gathered, and the first police at the scene confirmedtwo persons were dead and two others gravely injured. Dauntingly, one of theinjured occupants had been identified as the princess of Wales, and one of herdead companions was Dodi, the only son of Egyptian billionaire Mohamed Al-Fayed,the owner of Harrods of London and the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Paris.Flashbulbs dazzled as half a dozen paparazzi frantically snapped shuttertriggers while standing over still trapped victims. Verbal and physicalconfrontations had erupted with onlookers as photographers jostling for vantagepositions, greedily satisfying their need for sensation, hampered paramedicsattempting to free the injured. Motorcycles and cars parked haphazardly nearbymade it clear that the paparazzi had been close by when the collision occurred.And at the center of the melee the tortured wreck of a Mercedes-Benz sat, thedamage to the crashed vehicle so extensive that every panel including the roofwas misshapen.Even seasoned minds would have been racing as they attempted to get a handle onthis scene. Distancing themselves from the surrounding mayhem would be the onlyway for investigators to consider an approach. Although the incident bore allthe initial hallmarks of a high-speed accident, professional objectivity neededto kick in, questions needed to be posed.What caused this tragedy?Were other vehicles involved?Was there negligence or other factors?Could it have been foul play?Could mechanical interference be a contributor, or criminal interference? Couldthis be murder?”The word “murder” triggered a recollection. I snapped out of my fantasy andbegan hunting through a pile of newspapers that I had stacked in the laundry toawait my paintbrushes.Toward the bottom of the pile and dated several days before the crash, a featurearticle wrote that the French police were monitoring threats made by a Turkishterrorist group on Paris. I brought the paper out to join those archived on thefloor and paged through my work address book. Following a few well-placed phonecalls to a contact in the department of foreign affairs, I was armed with theknowledge that all consulates and diplomats had been on high alert.Could this then have been an act of terrorism? Had the Turkish group selectedthe princess of Wales as their target?I couldn’t ignore this proposition, yet the French had seemed to be doing justthat. I picked up a well-thumbed newspaper and thumbed again. Anxious to be ofhelp, some witnesses had offered comments of hearing “a noise like a gunshot,”others “an explosion” and “a loud bang.” Alarm bells began ringing in my head.These salient points drove it home to me; the tunnel and the Mercedes-Benzshould have been treated as a crime scene. Not just another accident scene.Surely the anti-terrorism squads should have been called in to inspect the sceneand undertake preliminary investigations to confirm or eliminate this type ofinvolvement?Too many questions were being left unanswered. Too many possibilities were beingswept aside, being allowed to ebb and fade with the passage of time. I was nolonger unsettled, I was worried—and I wasn’t alone in my worry for long.Hundreds of millions of the world’s perplexed citizens were finding a collectivevoice in the media. People everywhere were beginning to ask why such scantattention was being paid to the suspicious death of the world’s queen of hearts.As far as I was concerned, the inaction of the cumbersome French magistratesystem and its limp attendance at the crime scene was indefensible. Havingsuffered days of frustration, watching the slapdash investigation, I paid for myairfare, put together a travel bag with tapes, notebooks, pens, and a camera,and headed for the airport. I was booked on an Air France flight, and I onlyhoped that the French pilots would get their job right. I was back on duty.Five days after the accident, I sat high above the clouds wedged between a pairof restless teenage backpackers, reading an in-flight magazine. And on theground in Paris, for the first time, a team of investigating magistrates hadfinally closed off the traffic along the approach road to Tunnel Two. Like me,they were about to observe what remained of a scene that troubled the world.Inspecting the section of roadway was an eleven-member team, a mix ofdetectives, uniforms, and the overseeing magistrate. They strolled through thetunnel, hands in pockets, heads cocked and looking very haute couture asphotographers lapped up the opportunity to capture the performance on film. Thetour, in which not one notebook, pen, or camera was visible, lasted a merethirty minutes. Then they were gone and the appetites of the media temporarilysated.The conclusions drawn from the inspection, if indeed there were any given thenature of the very public parade, were not broadcast. The French judicial systemdirectly forbids investigative personnel from making statements to the press. Iwatched the news footage on the small screen in front of me and observed theactions of one of the team who may have been a forensic officer. He singled outa speck or two of debris that had lodged in the walls, fortuitously missing thecleaners’ brooms, and he appeared to take a sample for analysis. Glancing at thereactions of my fellow passengers, hearing their comments and high praise that“the police were on to it and would now sort it all out.” I could only shake myhead. While the public relations department of the French system appeared tohave scored a win, I wondered how many other detectives across the globe werealso smarting at the arrogance of such a flash visit to such an important scene.My relief at being finally free of an aircraft that allowed not only cigarettesmoking but also the pungent coils of cigar fumes to waft through the cabin wasalmost palpable. I stepped from the avant-garde, Barbarella-looking Charles deGaulle airport and hailed a ratty old Renault cab, pleased to drop my luggageinto its tiny trunk. Settling into the rear seat, I watched the familiararchitecture flash by and took in the fresh aroma of the driver’s Gauloises. Irolled down my window and pondered my days ahead.On each of my previous visits showers had greeted me, so a blue sky was ararity. I was relieved to hear, in my driver’s heavily accented English, thatthere had been no rain for the past couple of weeks, so like the family hound, Iput my head out of the window and sniffed my solace in the moisture-freeweather. It was still summer. While I’d be playing catch-up in the area ofcrime-scene management, the last thing I needed was for any remaining evidenceto be washed away by a downpour. So far, so good, I thought.My driver pushed on through the streams of early morning motorists toward theeighth arrondissement. We were headed for my favorite part of the old town, theMontmartre. I had a hankering to see the tunnel at the Place de l’Alma as soonas I had checked into my hotel, so when we came to a virtual standstill in thepeak hour traffic, I suggested that my driver head back that way first. Inclassic cabbie manner, his reaction to the change of direction was to hit thehorn a few times, force his way into a U-turn, swerve expertly across the flowof traffic, and resume a nonchalant cruising speed, ignoring the wildgesticulations of other motorists. Moments later we came to a halt before whatappeared to be a standing wake: hundreds of silent people, heads bowed. It was 9a.m., and already a crowd of internationals stood staring.The cab rumbled to life again and we cruised on past into the tunnel itself,where my driver slowed at pillar thirteen, draped in dead flowers. We stopped,to the annoyance of the commuting French. Literally invisible beneath the wiltedwreaths, most of the rendered surface of the pillar was cracked—scars of theprevious week.On our way again and emerging at the far end of the tunnel, we came to rest onthe side of the road. I stepped out and looked back at the overpass to thetunnel and the well-manicured rose garden along the approach. Not the types tolose themselves to overt flashes of grief, Parisians buzzed by, hurrying towork, faces straight ahead. The contrast between international grief and localhustle and bustle was as apparent as black and white, hot and cold. As I walkedcloser, the foreign faces that glanced up toward me said it all: heartache. Theoutpouring of respect was unforgettable. I could have been at Lourdes or theWailing Wall instead of downtown Paris. I bowed my head also and steppedcarefully around the floral tributes, then back to my taxi. It was time to findmy hotel.I don’t think I’ve come to Paris and not stayed at the Hôtel Chopin. At 10Boulevard Montmartre, it’s tucked away at the very end of a magnificenteighteenth-century arcade on the edge of the ninth arrondissement. Boastingfifty rooms over four levels, it’s only ten minutes’ walk from the Paris Operaand the famed Galeries Lafayette and is surrounded by picturesque boutiquesselling chocolates, handmade toys, cinema memorabilia, and ladies’ hautecouture. Laying down my Visa card on the reservations counter, I took in theambience of the foyer. The decor was the very image of the 1920s with its heavyinfluence of patterned fabrics and rickety furniture. I turned back to Charles,the manager of what would be my home for the next couple of weeks. The cheeryfellow, pleased by the lengthy booking, made sure I had one of his largest andbrightest two-star rooms, and with a view of a dozen downpipes. I climbed thestairs, dropped my bags, pulled open the heavy brocade drapes and unpacked myworld in budget heaven. My room had a comfortable queen-sized bed, a televisionset with a mess of channels, a direct-dial telephone, and a large desk waitingto be filled. Apart from my trusty traveling shoulder bag, I also carried a mindthat wouldn’t rest. As comfy as my room was, I couldn’t wait to head back to thePont de l’Alma, so I packed a small kit and hightailed it back to the scene.As I walked through the streets, I mulled over my approach. Arriving in earlySeptember, there were two major disadvantages to be overcome: firstly, the lackof resources; and secondly, the inevitable contamination of the scene. Ininvestigative terms, I was horribly underdressed for the occasion. Withinsufficient equipment, no backup, no authority, and less command of the Frenchlanguage than a four-year-old child, I’d be running on bluff. I feared thatvirtually all the evidence would have been swept away and my presence would lookmore ridiculous than probative. The only pleasure I had was in knowing that Iwasn’t far behind the official team. While the French magistrate had only spentmoments in the tunnel, I planned to call the scene home for as long as it took.I picked up my stride and listened to the hum of Paris.Moments later, I was in the thick of it, back to the watchful stares of thegathered mourners. I stepped gingerly to one side. As I adjusted my backpack andfidgeted for a pen, a familiar yet very unwanted feeling returned, like thatsensation in dreams when you find yourself naked in the main street of town. Soit is to be a detective at a crime scene, under the spotlight with the wholeworld watching via a telephoto lens. I paused at the curbside knowing that themoment I stepped onto the roadway and began taking measurements and photographsthat all eyes would focus on me. And there were literally hundreds of pairs.CHAPTER THREETo understand what might have happened at Diana’s end, we have to go back to thebeginning. We have to see what she was, who she became…and who was angered byit.With the whole world watching, the shy young schoolteacher married her handsomeprince on July 29, 1981, but this would not be her happily ever after. Therelationship was plagued by secrets and infidelity from the start.To understand Diana, we must understand the deep loneliness of Diana’s time atthe palace, from her isolation from Charles to the icy royal snobbery served upto her as an outsider. We must also appreciate her bouts of depression, bulimia,and self-harming, and how after she produced the required “heir and a spare”sons, William and Harry, her usefulness was effectively over. As Charles andCamilla Parker Bowles—who was nicknamed “The Rottweiler” by Diana—resumed theiraffair, Diana also sought comfort in the arms of other men…with sometimes tragicconsequences, as in the case of bodyguard-lover Barry Mannakee, who, in 1987,shortly after their affair was discovered, died in a mysterious car crash.Outside the palace walls, however, the press provided the attention she sodesperately craved and soon Diana’s every move became front-page news. The rogueprincess was born—and as the paparazzi grew more insatiable, Charles’sresentment of her popularity increased.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The woman they called the “people’s princess” and the “queen of hearts” waslauded with extraordinary affection. But the final year of Diana’s life was farmore complicated; behind the headlines and photos, the Princess had cultivatedenemies that could have cost her life. Yet, for most of the public, theseenemies were invisible and unknown. The legions of admirers knew only Diana, andcould not fathom that anyone would or could want to harm such a loving anddedicated woman.As Diana’s biographer Tina Brown put it in an exclusive interview, “Diana hadcharisma…. She had this great accessibility in which she always made everyoneshe spoke to feel as if she were only connecting with them.”Put another way, people took Diana personally. She meant something to them. Itwent beyond being relatable; there was empathy and sympathy. She was painfullyshy and had been thrust into the limelight of the world’s stage. There had beenroyals before—and would be royals after—but Diana was the first true superstar.What must this burden have been like? Many shuddered to imagine the burden onthe poor girl’s shoulders. They felt protective of her.And Diana touched millions in this way. Her adoring public hung on every wordthat she said, every item that she wore, every time she changed her hairstyle.Even her facial expressions in newsreels were powerfully meaningful to many.Explains Tina Brown:You could tell what she thought from the flush of her face and her big, huge,luminous blue eyes that welled with emotion when she looked at you, and made youfeel completely connected. She had this great accessibility in which she alwaysmeant everybody she spoke to feel as if she was connecting only to them. Thatwas who she was. That combination of her stature, her incredibly refined beauty,that wonderful peachy skin that was just flawless. Then, this greataccessibility and kindness where she was able to connect with people in thisvery human way. In a rope line, she would get down on her knees and bend downand talk to the children as if she was their mom, and she would have greatpersonal conversations with people and made them feel very special.Indeed, it didn’t take a rocket scientist to understand that Diana’s beauty farsurpassed those of other royals. She was literally stunning, sometimes renderingthose who met her utterly speechless. Her grin could disarm the powerful andmake people forget themselves utterly. On television it was one thing; but inperson and up close, it was truly a kind of magic.Yet the magic died forever in the early hours of August 31, 1997. Diana’s lightwas snuffed out forever, and in highly suspicious circumstances.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Among many other things, Diana’s death had the effect of freezing her in time.She would never grow wrinkled or old, or suffer any of the indignities that comewith age. Her failing and foibles would be, mostly, concealed. She would notmake a slip of the tongue or rash statement in anger that might betray a secret.She would stay as she was—as she had been in people’s minds—forever.As Ingrid Seward, royal expert and editor of Majesty magazine, said:It was like a Greek tragedy, the whole of her life…. Diana was so many differentpeople whirled into one that she was endlessly fascinating. She was one thing tome, and she would’ve been one thing to somebody else, and it depended on hermood of the day. Because her life ended in such a terrible tragedy, she will belike Marilyn Monroe. She will be an icon forever…. Because certain people incertain parts of the world are determined to believe that there was a conspiracytheory, the rumblings will always go on.But to tell the story in this book, we are forced to tell the story of anotherDiana. The one behind closed doors. The one whose life was—to put itindelicately—a complete mess. Diana doubted herself. She was self-consciousabout her own body, and feared that those who admired her were insincere.Further, she believed she had alienated herself from the very people she desiredto be closest to, including husband Charles, Prince of Wales (the heir apparentto the British throne), whose wandering eye—and hands—would stab Diana in theheart.Interviewed exclusively for this book, Diana’s butler of many years, PaulBurrell, expounded on the alienation Diana felt.I think the royal family take the view that things happen. The queen knows.She’s never interfered in any of her children’s relationships. Her attitude isthey make their beds, they lie on them, and they have to get on with it.These things aren’t spoken about. They happen but they happen in private andvery quietly.I stood beside the queen for a long time. I know how she performs, and I knowwhat her attitude would be. The queen would say to Diana, “It’s your husband.You have to sort out this situation. It’s nothing to do with me.”She does not interfere until it upsets the apple cart, until it comes to asituation where it involves the constitution of the monarchy—or the country.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The one area where Diana really came into her own was in her tireless devotionto charity work. Millions benefited in real, tangible ways from her crusadesagainst land mines and the spread of HIV. And Diana always insisted that sheshould not be a figurehead only. She insisted on being in the trenches,sometimes literally.As Burrell noted, “I remember the Red Cross once said to her, ‘We would like youto become an executive member of the board,’ and she said, ‘No, that’s not whatI want. I want to be on the factory floor. I don’t want to be in theboardroom.’”And truly, Diana moved mountains in the course of her charity work. But noteveryone in power was pleased by the particular causes she championed. And somefelt that such work might not be the proper place for a princess at all.Observed Tina Brown:There were people who felt that this is not what a royal person should be doing.She was constantly changing the rules and breaking the rules, and I would arguethey were upset. [They felt] the rules that should not have been broken. Ofcourse, since Diana, we have seen so many celebrities try to leverage their ownfame in the same way that Diana did…but no one has had the same kind of globaleffect that Diana had.Put bluntly, Diana’s charity work—the most rewarding and straightforward part ofher life—eventually became yet another place where she ruffled feathers and madeenemies.Powerful enemies.According to Paul Burrell:There were factions around the world who said that Diana was meddling insomething she didn’t understand because the land mine campaign was worthbillions to certain countries, and the manufacturer of these land mines, and shewas getting into very hot political and diplomatic water.Land mines. HIV. These were highly sensitive areas with huge sums of money tiedup on them. And Diana was successful at what she set out to do. This made herdangerous to the brokers of power.But if Diana was making enemies in the powerful international arms trade, shewas also angering those at the very top of the British establishment. When herfeud with Prince Charles spilled from the private to the public arena, Dianabecame an embarrassment…and a liability.Adds Paul Burrell:Immediately, there was Team Prince of Wales and Team Diana. I was happily—bynow—on Team Diana, and I thought I was on the winning side. I thought I was onthe side that mattered most, but a lady-in-waiting whispered in my ear, “Oh,don’t you realize? Diana will be gone and forgotten within a couple of years, soyou’re backing the loser. Remember who pays your wages. Remember where the moneycomes from. Remember who’s going to be king.”All of that was being drilled into me as I gave my allegiance to Diana. SoonDiana was being undermined, seriously undermined, by Charles’s people. There wasa movement.For any person in a royal family, going through marital difficulties would comewith the added strains of being in the public eye.But to say Diana was merely “in the public eye” would be a gross understatement.She was the most photographed woman in the world, probably the most photographedin all of human history. Media outlets were building an empire on her. She hadcreated an entirely new level of interest in and adulation for the royal family.Even the most hardened journalists and photographer realized that somethinguncannily special was going on.Darryn Lyons owned one of the largest international photo agencies in the worldand photographed Diana personally many times. Testifying as to the eerie powerof the princess, he said:Really, the hairs on the back of your neck stood up when the princess of Waleswas in your presence…. It was just an extraordinary experience…. She was trulyhypnotic for a photographer, and truly an extraordinary experience tophotograph.It was a penny for her thoughts, the world around her. Although, the pennyturned into a multimillion-dollar business of photographing her every movement,of every minute of every day. I think she was the first of the great royalsupermodels as well.Yet crucial to understanding her life and death is to understand that Diana wasnot only under the surveillance of photographers looking to get the next greatcover shot. She was under almost constant surveillance by the secret services.She received the kind of security attention usually reserved for the leader of anation. We know for certain that agencies such as the CIA kept files on her, butthose spy agencies have always refused to make any of their collectedinformation public.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------DETECTIVE’S NOTEBOOKDATELINE: Early September 1997, days after the horrorA detective’s workplace, his crime scene, is often in a very public location.And there is something about the yellow and black striped crime-scene tape thatdraws spectators to its edges, like bees to honey. So under the watchful nods ofinquisitive heads, the one with right of access to the inner sanctum, thedetective, untrained as he is for celebrity, becomes just that. It’s hisworkplace. And, whether he likes it or not, it’s his stage, and the audience ishappy for standing-room-only tickets. Their eyes study his every move, takingnote of his note-taking. They watch and gape, roll out their own theories andpoint fingers. It’s a strange phenomenon when you’re just trying to do your job,a fusion of self-importance, self-consciousness, and a burning need to unravel apuzzle. A dead body is the ultimate of all puzzles. Detectives embrace the game,relish the challenge, and hold dear the methodology that needs to be employed tocome up with the answers. I know I did, each and every time I stepped into “my”crime scene, “my” workplace.But this was a very different scene. It could possibly be described as the mosttelevised crime scene in history, and I was about to step into it and takeownership. At the Pont de l’Alma I found no crime-scene tape; in fact, therenever was any. I was going to need a keener eye than ever before, as this crimescene was all but gone. What was still there was a bigger crowd than I’d everwitnessed. I felt alone and a tad ill at ease. In a normal crime-sceneenvironment, there were usually at least half a dozen others assisting, helpingto block out the audience and making it easier for everyone to get on with thetask. I mingled a little longer, getting a sense of being there, touching on amood. Finally, I hitched up my pack, stepped onto the outbound carriageway, andstrolled purposefully toward the tunnel, to the scene of the accident.I spent the first hour letting my eyes do all the work. My brain was on overloadfrom the flood of information I had soaked up during the 24/7-televisioncoverage since the incident occurred. I must have read every written word on thesubject at least a few times over. The mountain of discarded newspaper storiesthat I had left on my warehouse floor would wrap fish and chips well into thenew millennium. I had as good a grasp on the job as I could get; now I stood andtried to imagine it. Protected by a concrete divider, I ambled along the centerof the carriageway and watched traffic approach the tunnel, enter, and whizzpast on both sides. Designed to move the flow quickly and efficiently withoutthe hindrance of traffic lights or pedestrians, the dual carriageway was more afreeway than an inner-city street. Almost without exception, the carsapproaching from the direction that Princess Diana’s Mercedes would havetraversed were moving at speeds above 50 mph despite clearly visible 50 kph (30mph) road signs along both sides of the carriageway. This was the first of manyabsurdities that I would discover in Paris.[../media/file2.jpg]The Place de l’Alma, above the tunnel, scene of the accident. The actual tunnelis under an eternal flame shown in the center foreground. ShhutterstockMy eyes followed the path of a small Citroën. I noted that just prior to thetunnel entrance the roadway dipped away sharply and veered to the left at thesame time. It was a stretch of asphalt that called out for care and a slowing ofspeed; a pair of dark skid marks attested to someone’s miscalculation, yet theCitroën and the other Parisians that followed seemed to hum along undeterred. Asit disappeared into the tunnel, I glanced upward at the structure of theapproach. Years of pollution, rain, snow, and exhaust emissions had weatheredthe dividing walls. They were heavily coated with a layer of brown filth thatmasked in entirety the rendered concrete surface. However, even after thepassage of days, when confronted by the visibly deep scrapes in this surface itwas still obvious that something had recently hit at great force; somethingentirely consistent in this investigator’s mind, with a mass of metal containingfour adults and weighing a total of nearly two tons. I strolled farther alongthe road and disappeared into the tunnel. My first up-close look at pillarthirteen showed, despite its trampled and squashed floral adornments, theindisputable scars of where the Mercedes had come to rest. The surface wasseriously fractured.Back in the daylight and growing accustomed to the stares of mourners, I decidedit was time to start sketching. Out came my notebook and measuring tape and offto work I went. The first few hours were dedicated to determining dozens ofdistances, aspects, and lines between the points of impact. At regular intervalssome of the less reticent onlookers would approach, curious to ascertain what Iwas doing. Was I a French detective? Conscious of their genuine concern, Ianswered inquiries as best as I could while remaining aware of making as muchprogress as possible before nightfall. It was as I stopped for one of thesechats during the course of the afternoon that I became aware of the glances of asmall crew of municipal workers on the opposite roadway, the city approach. Ilooked up on several occasions afterward, admiring the diligence of a gardenerworking on a run of roses. Occasionally we nodded. By 5 p.m. he was gone withthe two others, and I was also looking for an end to my workday.I rested my eyes with the view of his roses. Following the taper of the flowerbed downward, I admired the well-manicured grassy shoulder and looked over themajestic square-cut concrete capping. An identical capping existed on my side ofthe roadway, running along the top of a 118-foot-long retaining wall ranging inheight from zero to 61/2 feet as the road fell away. The garden on my side wasin need of work; mourners had trampled most of the planting. Glancing backtoward the Pont de le Concorde, I realized that I was standing in a direct linewith the approaching traffic. Should a vehicle fail to veer left or misjudge theturn, it would collide with me and then the retaining wall. As the carscontinued to whizz by, the square capping caught my eye again. I stopped short,initially startled by my observation, a feature that had not been reported byany media.Along the uppermost length of the capping was a well-defined fresh tire marking.The principle of “every contact leaves its trace” sprung to mind. The wheel of avehicle had obviously made contact with that capping and at great force, leavingits telltale thick black residue, a distance of two meters long. I moved closer.The black rubber against the white surface of the capping looked like a horrificscar; the stretch of minute bristles of rubber still adhered to the concretesurface. Obviously, the official magistrate’s team missed this. Let’s notforget, had they found it, and pored over it, the many TV cameras would havehighlighted their discovery.[../media/file3.jpg]The white capping above the retaining wall at the foot of the rose gardenshowing a large tire scrape on the side surface with black rubber residue. ColinMcLarenI rubbed my hand very lightly over the length of about a meter and felt the tinyrubber residue tickle my palm. Some of the fragments fell to the road surface asI touched them. It was very fresh, very recent. The oddity of such a bold tiremark over a meter above the road surface held my attention. For a vehicle toleave a mark at this height, it would have had to be airborne. There was simplyno other explanation. Regardless of the obvious, I tried to think of other waysthat tire residue could adhere to the vertical surface of the capping. Therewere none. This was one of those investigative moments that detectives love:simple induction and then, deduction. The Mercedes had clearly reached anenormous speed on its approach path. I imagined the car ricocheting from thecapping, from where I was standing. I turned to look into the tunnel and foundmyself staring directly at pillar thirteen.[../media/file4.jpg]Two 23-foot-long parallel skid marks on the right-hand side adjacent to themerge lane before the road drops away on the approach to the tunnel. ColinMcLarenAs pleased as I was to discover the marking, I was equally disappointed toconclude that my speculation was correct. There was no evidence—such as ascalpel marking for a controlled sample—that a sample had been collected forexamination by the French forensics team. It was perfectly “in situ,” asdetectives say, found as it had happened. Time and weather conditions would indue course brush the residue from the wall surface to be washed away down thestormwater drains, but for now the tire markings were a deep rich black incolor. I took many photographs and a tiny sample of the rubber residue for lateranalysis, and left the rest untouched. I chalked one up to the independentinvestigator and turned back to my crime scene looking towards the city forsigns of excessive speed, or anything else that would help me to understand whythe car had become airborne.[../media/file5.jpg]Close-up of the skid marks showing tire tread and fluctuations in the treadconsistent with the vehicle suffering a minor impact with another vehicle. ColinMcLarenThere on the roadway in the distance, in a neat line between the tire residue onthe capping and the center of the road, was a pair of dark skid marks. I’dnoticed them earlier at the point just before the road starts to dip, but hadfailed to make the connection. I envisaged a driver hurtling along, desperatelyattempting to pull up his vehicle before losing control. I walked to the centerof the roadway and stood between the marks and observed two precise parallelmarkings, each of seven meters. I measured them. I also took a range ofmeasurements to estimate the distance between the tires using the center of theskid mark as the start and finish of each measurement. They were consistently4.52 feet apart. The rubber appeared relatively fresh and darkest toward thecenter of the markings. There was a wavering or fluctuation, or bubble-likebulge in the front section of the tread closest to the tunnel. I looked back tothe retaining wall and then into the tunnel. I stood there off and on as passingcars allowed. It was becoming easier to understand how three deaths had comeabout.Many detectives, when they think they have the answer to a particular puzzle,play the negative. I took on that exercise, playing devil’s advocate trying todiscount my theory to prove myself wrong. I threw in half a dozen hypotheticalnotions. I tried to separate the two sets of markings. Skid marks might notresult in an airborne vehicle, but for a vehicle to literally fly into aretaining wall at such a height, some lead-up markings would surely be expected.There were no other tread marks of any sort in the vicinity.The two sets of markings that I had discovered appeared to my seasoned eye to beof similar ages, both still black, both fresh, so I linked the two features.I imagined a vehicle other than the princess’s chauffeured car leaving 23-footskid marks at the same scene. I imagined that same vehicle’s tires leaving theirresidue on the side of the capping near the rose gardens and then not cannoninginto pillar thirteen. But who and how and what were they doing up there airbornethemselves, and where could they have come to rest if not at pillar thirteen?There had been no mention of another major crash at this site. And for theresidue to be still fresh, it would have to have been shortly before theMercedes’ last voyage. I simply couldn’t find credence in another vehiclebecoming airborne in the same location after the August 31 collision, especiallyas that location had been crowded with bystanders, municipal workers, police,and the omnipresent media since then.The more I imagined the possibilities, the stronger my original hypothesisseemed. I was now convinced that the Mercedes had braked sharply (evident fromthe skid marks) then became airborne (where the tires kissed the side of thecapping) with the result that the (by this stage) out-of-control projectilefinally slammed into pillar thirteen within the tunnel.Night started to fall, and I realized that I hadn’t eaten all day. I wentlooking for a meal. I had much to contemplate.[../media/file6.jpg]An artist’s impression of the path taken by Diana’s Mercedes after passing themerge lane, clipping the retaining wall and careering toward the thirteenthpillar in the tunnel. Dylan HowardCHAPTER FOURDiana was many things to many people. For many members of her adoring public,she was a naive waif who’d been cast into dangerous waters. She was a victim.She was beset on all sides.This was true.It was also just what Diana wanted people to think.For you see, Diana truly was a woman in great peril. She was mistreated by herpowerful husband, and had in-laws who did not particularly like her (and the wayshe stole the spotlight). She was acutely, and correctly, aware of the powerfulforces she had angered through her targeted charity work. And she knew that herown romantic liaisons were transgressive in a way that would not be longtolerated.But Diana had learned something. As the woman arguably subject to more pressattention than anyone else in the world, Diana had come to understand the powerof the printed word. (And the photograph. And the video clip.) Diana’smanipulation of the press started gently, but quickly grew in intensity.Diana had seen what kind of a weapon the press could be. What a powerful forceit could create. And—in a move that further angered those who disliked Diana—shebegan using it to protect herself from her enemies.Diana began keeping diaries and recordings of both her personal experiences andthe royal family’s secrets. She was perfectly positioned to access the innermostprivacies. And when she saw that it would help insulate her from harm—ordissuade someone else from coming after her—she was only too willing to leakthis material herself.By the time Andrew Morton’s sensational, tell-all book Diana: Her True Story waspublished in 1992, the Windsors were already embittered against Diana—forever,in perpetuity, no takebacks—with Prince Philip especially furious. Diana hadspoken to Morton about her marriage, about her bulimia, about her frustrationswith the royal family, and about Camilla. No other royal family member had everdone such a thing. There had been royal transgressions, certainly. There hadbeen abdications. There had been forbidden romances. But no royal had ever toldtales out of school to the press itself.This was a deep and profound shock.As the marriage between Diana and Charles very publicly unraveled, Diana alsogave a sensational tell-all interview with BBC journalist Martin Bashir.Tina Brown synthesized the problems this created:She elected to do go on television, on BBC of all channels, which has alwaysbeen big supporters of the royal family, and give this wildly explosiveinterview to Martin Bashir where she really did looking tragic with makeup thatshe’d applied very skillfully, with a pebble face and dark eyes and looking likea haunted woman, talked about the agony of being in love with a man who wasn’tin love with you, and who had always been unfaithful with Camilla. She said, ofcourse, there are three of us in this marriage, which became a hugely quotedphrase all over the world. How she thought that Charles wasn’t appropriate to beking and how the royal family were out of touch. This was explosive stuff. Inanother century, she would’ve been sent to the Tower of London, and thenexecuted for talking like that about the monarch.This proved to be the final straw. It was more than manipulation of the press;it was a declaration of war. Charles would not have it, and the couple divorcedin 1996.Refusing to simply disappear (as the Windsors fervently hoped she would do),Diana instead chose to use her fame to “double down” on her charity work, mostespecially her work with AIDS awareness and campaigning against land mines. Aswe have seen, these causes in particular also made Diana a good number of newenemies.And now the paparazzi was insatiable. Despite the royal divorce—or perhapsbecause of it—photos of Diana could be worth a fortune, and they hadphotographers hounding Diana day and night, watching her every move in the hopesof securing a bumper payday.The ensuing chaos was unsafe.An astonishing fact for many, Diana’s Royal Protection security had actuallybeen dismissed after her divorce from Charles. While security still followedDiana, it did not belong to the crown.By the summer of 1997, things were coming to a head. The media circussurrounding Diana had reached a fever pitch. Diana had never been more popularwith the public, yet had never had more enemies in the establishment. PrincePhilip loathed her. The other senior royals were terrified of what she knewabout them. British Defense Minister Earl Howe described her as “a loosecannon.” US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called her a “considerableembarrassment.”She was under covert surveillance by MI6 and the CIA, and, perhaps mostdangerously, her campaign to ban land mines was threatening themultibillion-dollar business of powerful—and ruthless—international armsdealers.Yet Diana knew enough to use this to insulate herself. Iconic photos were takenof Diana, in the field, working to fight the use of land mines. In January 1997,she walked into a live minefield in Angola to take a personal lesson in how todismantle explosives. She was often seen beside young amputees, the victims ofthe horrible scourge she sought to eradicate. In one memorable picture, Dianastands in full body armor, near a sign that says “danger,” in a live minefield.There are many iconic pictures of the princess, but for many of her fans, thisone ranks near the very top.And Diana made sure the press that followed her and reported on her actions sawthat it was not just for photo ops that she traveled to these places. Diana alsotook the time to sit and talk with victims of mines, and to educate herself onthe most effective tactics to combat their spread.Diana also educated herself and spoke out on matters related to policyimplementation. This further angered many in government—members of parliamentaccused her of working outside the system to contravene government policy—yet italso solidified her concern as genuine and real.And she did not let up her intensity. Just twenty days before the fateful nightin Paris when her life ended, Diana had been in Bosnia, seeing what could bedone about the land mine problem there.The news coverage had been spectacular.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------DETECTIVE’S NOTEBOOKDATELINE: The next day. Early September 1997Day two began as day one, pacing out the scene with measuring tape in one handand notebook in the other. More eyes watching me, more mourners in tears. I didmy best to ignore the audience and opened a fresh page of my trusty moleskin.For clarity and to help better document and understand the accident, I chose todivide the scene into two key areas.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I called the approach path “Area One.” I scrawled a sketch indicating a distanceof 1,050 feet from the nearest set of traffic lights on the approach to thetunnel entrance. The first 558 feet was a straight, flat road surface, the last492 feet (which commenced at the skid marks) I drew with a notation of a 13-footcurved descent (into the tunnel, which I named “Area Two”).An interesting feature of Area One came to my attention as I roughed in thegarden beds. As my scope broadened from the immediate road to the larger area, Inoted that there was a merge lane that flowed into the highway adjacent to theskid marks. I tossed my notebook and pencil into my pack and strode over for acloser inspection.Paralleling the highway and flanking a run of office blocks and apartmentbuildings was a one-way carriageway officially known as Cours Albert. The mergesection was at the mouth of this very narrow roadway. I walked back to the mainroad and stood between the skid marks facing the merge lane, wondering why thedriver of Princess Diana’s Mercedes had hit the brakes so hard at that exactpoint. I turned my head to the direction opposite the merge lane and noticedfresh scrape marks on the retaining wall that I now faced, the retaining wallopposite the rose bushes. Clearly the Mercedes couldn’t have made those marks.On the road surface below the marks, tiny fragments were glistening in theafternoon sunlight. I walked across to the left-hand retaining wall. None of thefragments, obviously originating from a broken headlight, were dirty or dustcovered. They were fresh.[../media/file7.jpg]Area One, the approach to the tunnel with the merge lane at the end of CoursAlbert visible on the left. The facades of diplomatic embassies are visiblebeyond the trees. Colin McLarenI stepped back onto the highway and looked down at the skid marks again, takingcloser note of the fluctuations in tread toward the tunnel. It was a classicsign that a vehicle had been nudged from the side, but not with sufficient forceto knock it from its course (hence the tire residue was continuous in the onedirection). I considered the likelihood of a car having crept onto the highwayfrom the merge lane just as the Mercedes careered past. The rumble of anapproaching vehicle had me hop quickly back up to the relative safety of theconcrete capping. The more I studied the scene the relationship between the skidmarks and the merge lane from my new vantage point, the more likely it appearedto me that a second vehicle had entered the highway from that merge lane and hadcaused the Mercedes to brake suddenly in an unsuccessful attempt to avoidcontact.I watched with interest as cars traveled single file along Cours Albert and tookthe merge lane to enter the highway. It was a quiet little street really, thetype that would most likely only be known and used by locals. I took a stroll toconfirm my premise. After an hour of meandering through the network of tinyone-way and dead-end streets, I was convinced that the only vehicles that woulduse Cours Albert had to have come from the apartment blocks or the officebuildings or from the only side street, known as Rue Bayard. Cours Albert wasnot a shortcut or thoroughfare to any other road. This was a small littlebackwater area that only people with a genuine purpose would use. It smacked oflocal knowledge. I wandered back to the crime scene. For the rest of the day Ioften looked back along the merge lane at the many facades and buildings. It waspreying on my mind.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Area Two refers to the flat road surface of the tunnel, running in an east-westdirection, well-lit with a continuous stretch of wall sconce lighting. In thecenter of the carriageway are the equally spaced support pillars with numberthirteen standing out like a beacon. I shuffled along next to it and attempted aline of sight toward the retaining wall capping that had been bruised by thetire residue. It was a dead straight line. I moved farther along to pillarsfourteen, fifteen, sixteen, and onward, but the tire residue disappeared fromview. As I meandered back to pillar thirteen, I had little doubt in my mind thepath traveled by the late princess’s vehicle. I rummaged in my shoulder bag,found my camera, and began the process of photographing the different points ofimpact and aspects of the scene.The municipal gardeners watched my work with obvious curiosity. The caretaker ofthe roses was doing his best to return my side of the roadway to itswell-manicured former glory. He offered a “Bonjour,” so I strolled over andintroduced myself.Claude was a native Frenchman in his mid-forties. He was a big bloke with adrab, full mop of hair. We struck up a conversation in broken French-English,him wiping the fresh soil on his well-worn pair of blue overalls, I slinging theNikon back in its leather case. This was the first of many chats we would haveover the next week. This was Claude’s patch. He was a proud gardener and webecame mates of a sort, toiling alongside each other, both with differentobjectives but the same workplace.Claude resided on the outskirts of Paris in an upstairs apartment with hisfamily. He boasted that it was he who had planted the roses and nurtured theirgrowth. He was greatly disappointed by the crowds’ carelessness and the damagedone to them over the previous week. It was going to be quite a job to bringthem back to their former beauty. I guessed that it was his apartment lifestylethat had shaped his devotion to his rose garden. Like most Frenchmen, he was asporting man. Once he knew I wasn’t a French detective but an Australian versionof the same trade, he offered banter about our opposing rugby teams and theworld tennis circuit. He was great company.On the day of August 31, Claude had been enjoying a rare sojourn, relaxing withhis wife. Rising early the next morning for his working day, Claude had beennone the wiser of the tragic event until he arrived in his garden to the firststream of pilgrims to the site. He had been on duty most days since. With hiscomprehensive knowledge of the area, I was keen to have him confirm the historyof the markings and scrapings scarring the barriers.Claude attested that he first noted the damage when he arrived for work themorning after the fateful accident. He indicated toward the two skid marksadjacent to the merge lane. He claimed those were fresh, too, from the day afterthe accident. I stood him before the minute burrs of rubber that I haddiscovered on the retaining wall capping. Witnessing firsthand the alarm in hisreaction, I became sure that I had found something that others had missed.Claude knew his garden well and offered me independent corroboration that thepoints of impact that I was documenting were indeed fresh on the day after theprincess’s death.I circled the three prominent points of impact recorded in my journal. Theystood out like scars, like wounds on a corpse. The first were on the capping ofthe right-hand retaining wall and contained the tire markings where small rubberresidue fibers still adhered to the wall. A second set of tire markings andscarring of the rendered surface of the retaining wall was situated on theopposite left-hand side of the carriageway. And of course, the third and lastpoint of impact was at pillar thirteen.[../media/file8.jpg]Close-up of the scrape marks made by the Mercedes, showing the contrast with thedirty retaining wall and verified by Claude as “fresh” the morning after theaccident. Colin McLarenAll of a sudden, the accident became easy to understand. The princess’sMercedes-Benz, hurtling along the last stretch of the highway in Area One, hadhit the brakes at the merge lane. The fluctuations in the tire markings indicatea minor contact with another vehicle, but not enough to take the Mercedes offcourse. With the combination of the curved camber and the road surface fallingaway, the Mercedes had then become airborne, landed briefly on the capping,having almost mounted Claude’s rose garden, before ricocheting toward pillarthirteen. Meanwhile, a second vehicle, having grazed the Mercedes on enteringthe carriageway from the merge lane, staggered across the roadway and collidedwith the left-hand retaining wall, brushing tire residue before limping away anddisappearing, probably after the Mercedes had come to a rest.I took a seat in my now usual spot on top of the retaining wall capping andspent an hour staring at the impact points and the approach path, mulling overmy theory. The rest of the afternoon I devoted to filling my first notebook withfurther distances and measurements. I charted the entire region, in and out ofthe tunnel way and the half of a mile back to the Place de la Concorde at thecity center. As darkness fell, I found myself hungry again and headed off toeat. Much had been achieved.It was while I idled over my stack of tartare frites that I unearthed some handyaffirmation of my theory. I had taken a handful of newspaper clippings todinner, mostly photographs that I had collected from the articles. To mydelight, among them was a snippet from the Guardian newspaper of London datedSeptember 1, reporting, “Fresh skid marks…visible yesterday on the concretedividing wall.”I went through the remainder of my stash and found one further article where areporter mentioned scarring on the retaining wall. In high spirits with thesubstantiation, I ordered a double helping of chocolate crème anglaise.[../media/file9.jpg]Artist’s impression of the path taken by Princess Diana’s Mercedes after itsminor collision with the Fiat Uno at the merge lane. Dylan HowardCHAPTER FIVEThe words “Happily Ever After” were never in Diana’s stars. Romantic happinesswas fleeting, at best, in her life, despite a long string of lovers.Dating the royal carried with it what her inner circle eventually came to call“The Diana Curse.” The elite group of men who got entangled with theprincess—from aristocrats to a rock star and Academy Award nominee—soon foundthat falling for the queen of hearts came at a hefty price.Many of Diana’s lovers—several of whom were married or engaged when Diana gother hooks into them—have been struck by scandal, tragedy, and death.Here, we examine Diana’s romantic history, and find out how her lovers’ fateswere forever altered after their time with the anxious blonde who spent her lifedesperate to snag “the one.”From this examination, we also come to see how Diana herself was altered by herentanglements and, indeed, how they contributed, step-by-step, to her ownundoing.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------“Our wedding day was the worst of my life.”WHOPrince CharlesWHENFirst and only husband, 1981–1996WHAT HAPPENEDThis was the man initially idolized, then despised, by Diana.Diana was an introverted virgin who thought she was fat, spotty, and stupid whenthey met. She had posters of Charles on her wall at both her divorced parents’homes, seeing him as some sort of James Bond character.Charles reckoned he was some kind of Renaissance man—a swashbuckling “actionstar” with a fierce intellect to boot.A year before he proposed to Diana, the prince of Wales was on the rebound fromhis affair with Anna “Whiplash” Wallace, whose ferocious temper earned her thatnickname. Wallace was a dangerous version of Princess Diana—tall, blonde, and areckless horsewoman. Charles was sexually obsessed by her and would probablyhave married her if she hadn’t dumped him because of his love for Camilla ParkerBowles.It was that enduring love that drove Diana to tears a week before her wedding toCharles, who famously once told Diana he refused to be the only British princewithout a mistress.His cruelties continued. Diana spent every day crying during their monthlongstay at the queen’s rain-lashed Balmoral estate in Scotland when she found outhe had been wearing a pair of cufflinks given to him by Camilla. Instead ofspending their honeymoon sleeping with Diana, he lay on bed reading the books ofLaurens van der Post, about the author’s mystical and religious experiences inAfrica. While Charles was steeped in his newfound interest in horticulture andindulged his passion for fishing at Balmoral, Diana had two words for the place:“rainy/boring.” And while Diana is a very young bride, Charles was a very oldthirty-year-old.Despite their being worth millions, Diana became appalled in the early days oftheir marriage by his Scrooge-like frugality. One of his most unappealing habitswas refusing to update the decor at his home in Highgrove—and he constantlychecked the fridge for signs servants were overeating. To offset her boredom andsexual frustration, Diana went into overdrive with interior designer DudleyPoplak, revamping the interior while forming friendships with celebs to get outof stuffy royal dinners. The frustration grew into rage and poisonousexchanges—Charles telling Diana she was moronic and mocking her bulimia bytelling her it was a “waste” for her to eat if food was going to be brought upagain.She went on to blame him for sparking her self-harm and suicide attempt whenpregnant with Prince William.Richard Kay:She did fall or threw herself down a flight of stairs at Sandringham, thequeen’s estate in Norfolk, England, and the Queen Mother found her at the bottomof the stairs. Obviously, they had to call a doctor to make sure the unbornchild was all right.She was desperately unhappy, and she wanted people to know that she was unhappy.She found no one would listen to her. They all thought, “Oh it’s just a questionof Diana you’ve just got to adjust. You’ve just got to pull yourself togetherand get on with it. You know, a stiff British upper lip. Just pull yourselftogether. You’re in the royal family now.”Ken Warfe:Diana herself said to me that yes, she did throw herself down some stairs and…Isaid, “Well, I can’t imagine you throwing yourself down—why would you throwyourself down the—?” Well I was just so unhappy that I just wanted people toknow.” It was a real quest for “look at me.” As in, “Nobody’s listening to me”Part of Charles “having his own way” included rekindling his relationship withCamilla Parker Bowles—even as his young, desperately unhappy wife was at herabsolute lowest.“Diana felt the threat of Camilla very early,” noted Tina Brown.“He always felt she was the love of his life. Then, when the marriage began togo wrong, which was pretty early on, the wedding and even the engagement wasgoing wrong. The feelings for Camilla surfaced again.”According to Brown, Diana’s suspicions that Charles and Camilla had never trulyended their relationship began before they had even got married.During the engagement, she was absolutely devastated when she found in Charles’sprivate secretary’s office a package that was destined to go to Camilla, whichwas a bracelet that Charles had brought her engraved with GNF…. It was anickname between them, and she was livid.Then, on the honeymoon, she was further devastated when Charles appeared atdinner wearing a pair of cufflinks that Camilla had bought for him. Then, shestarted to overhear phone calls. She started to hear horrid quiet calls betweenCharles and Camilla, which Charles would be taking from the bathroom because hedidn’t want her to hear.She always felt, though, Camilla was in their marriage and that she couldn’tsomehow get her out. Of course, that feeling grew, and it was almost aself-perpetuating prophecy because she was so deeply jealous and became sodeeply paranoid about Camilla, that in a sense, she’s in a way almost willed thetruth to be as it was, which was that they became reinvolved.The suspicions proved to be well-founded.“Camilla, from my time in the mid ’80s, was very present,” said Warfe. “Youknow, it’s a fact that when Diana would leave Highgrove House on a Sundayafternoon to return to London with her children for school. In a very shortperiod of time thereafter, Camilla arrived at Highgrove House. That was known.That happened. There was nothing secret about the prince of Wales’s relationshipwith Camilla…everybody inside Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace knewexactly what was happening. This was the problem.”Wharfe remembers one incident in particular, when Diana’s crushing despair ather husband’s betrayal led her to finally confront the woman he was betrayingher with: at Camilla’s sister Annabel’s fortieth birthday party.I didn’t think, really, that the prince anticipated that Diana would reallyaccept this invitation, knowing full well that Camilla would be there.I remember driving with them both to Richmond, and very little was said in thecar, if anything at all, and we arrived, and I don’t actually think the vastmajority of the guests were expecting Diana there, either, because once the dooropened, it was like…the only thing I could liken it to was like freeze framingher, a shock in a movie, with absolute horror when they saw that Diana wasthere.I’d been there for about forty minutes, forty-five, maybe a bit longer. It couldhave been an hour. I heard my name being called outside and it was Diana, andDiana said, “Ken, I can’t find my husband or Camilla.”Within a short period of time, we found Prince and Camilla sitting on a sofa,away from the other guests. I didn’t quite know what Diana was going to do now.I stood there in complete anticipation, not realizing or thinking what she mightdo. It was a sort of moment of silence from everybody and eventually, Diana,with a great deal of courage and confidence, went across to Camilla and said,“Listen, please don’t treat me like an idiot. I know exactly what’s going on.”Then Camilla said something which I will never forget. She said, “Well, it’sokay for you. You’ve got two marvelous boys, two wonderful boys.” That, I don’tthink really Diana was able to still understand what she was talking about,because I certainly didn’t. The prince was looking very bemused by it all. Itried to excuse myself and Diana said, “No, stay. Just wait there, Ken. Waitthere.” There were some other exchanges and eventually, they all returned towhere the room was, and we returned to the garden at the end of the evening.Nothing was said on the return journey back to Kensington Palace.Diana’s humiliation was complete. Rejected by her husband, scorned by Camilla,ignored by the other royals, desperately alone, and suffering from self-harmingissues, she embarked on a series of affairs of her own.Diana later revealed their marriage was sexless and claimed Charles plotted tokill her and have her committed when she threatened to reveal the secrets of theroyal family—including her suspicion Charles was bisexual. And she blamed hislack of love for driving her into the arms of a series of men as their marriagecrumbled. But it was Charles who transformed the blushing English virgin into aglobal campaigner for good causes, leading her to be dubbed “the mouse thatroared.”As Charles resumed his affair with Camilla, Diana went on to have her own stringof suitors before finally separating from Charles in 1993—something royalcourtiers claimed never bothered the callous prince.Diana’s own infidelities included dashing cavalry officer James Hewitt, carsalesman James Gilbey, and art dealer Oliver Hoare—who was not only married, buta close friend of Prince Charles.Finally, it seemed, Diana had had enough of being pushed around. After over adecade of misery and rejection at the hands of the royal family, she vowed tofight back. The rogue princess was born—and she had a weapon in her armory theysimply couldn’t handle. Charisma.WHERE HE IS NOWThe seventy-year-old is in line to become king. Father to his two sons to Diana,Harry and William, Charles eventually married his longtime love, Camilla ParkerBowles, in a civil ceremony in 2005.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------“I think he was bumped off. He was the greatest fellow I have ever had—I waslike a little girl in front of him the whole time, desperate for praise,desperate.”WHOThe Father Figure: Sgt. Barry MannakeeWHENAffair, 1985–1986WHAT HAPPENEDDiana believed her married police bodyguard Barry Mannakee paid the ultimateprice for getting involved with her.He was the first of the men from whom the princess sought comfort from duringher unhappy marriage to cheating Prince Charles—and the second man she’d everbedded. They got together when Diana, then only twenty-three, sufferedpostpartum depression after the birth of Harry in September 1984.Thirty-seven-year-old Mannakee became her father figure and confidant. Dianabecame so enamored with the plain-looking Royal Protection Squad officer shetold him, “I’m quite willing to give all this up,” and often lay in bed with himtalking about how she wanted to run away with him.The affair ended in disaster when, on the eve of Prince Andrew and SarahFerguson’s wedding in July 1986, Charles’s bodyguard Colin Trimming discoveredDiana and her married protection officer in a “compromising position.”By September, Mannakee had been transferred to other diplomatic duties.Diana gushed about him, “I tell you one of the biggest crushes of my life, whichI don’t find easy to discuss, was when I was twenty-four/twenty-five and I felldeeply in love with somebody who worked in this environment. I should never haveplayed with fire. But I did. And I got burned.”WHERE HE IS NOWDead—suspected assassinated. The following May after Mannakee was found gettingintimate with Diana, and just two weeks before his fortieth birthday, Mannakeewas killed in a motorcycle crash on the outskirts of East London. He was on hisSuzuki motorbike when it collided with a teenager’s car. While a coroner ruledthat the death was a tragic accident, Diana was convinced that he was murderedby the British secret service, who feared she had spilled royal secrets duringpillow talk. The princess’s next major love, James Hewitt, would claim without ashred of evidence that Mannakee had been murdered by a rogue Britishintelligence officer. It’s perhaps his take on Mannakee’s death that led Dianato later say, “It was all found out and he was chucked out. And then he waskilled. And I think he was bumped off. But, there we are. I don’t…we’ll neverknow.”Diana always kept a brown teddy bear in her bedroom after Mannakee’s death—agift from him. Charles is said to have cruelly taunted Diana over Mannakee’sdeath, telling her to go and “cry to the cameras” when she found out he had beenkilled.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------“Yes, I adored him. Yes, I was in love with him. But I was very let down.”WHOThe Cad: James HewittWHENAffair, 1986–1990WHAT HAPPENEDA hero in war but not in love, Hewitt broke Diana’s heart by cashing in on theirrelationship by cooperating on a tell-all memoir about their fling written inthe style of a trashy Mills & Boon romance.The former Household Cavalry officer and tank commander began the affair withDiana in 1986 when he was twenty-seven after they met at a cocktail party andHewitt promised to teach Diana to ride and cure her fear of horses—somethingCharles hated, and which allowed him to bond with Camilla.Diana had first laid eyes on Hewitt when he played polo against herhusband-to-be Charles less than a week before their wedding in 1991. It was thematch from which Diana fled after discovering Charles and Camilla had beensending each other love notes and gifts using their code names Gladys and Fred.Hewitt told Charles when he scored the winning goal in the match, “There’s yourwedding present, sir.”A passionate affair of love-nests and visits to Highgrove followed for the nextfive years until Hewitt left to serve in the Gulf War.They met in secret at Combermere Barracks in Windsor and according toHewitt—whose laddish pals boasted he was a well-endowed lothario—they also hadtrysts at Althorp, the Spencers’ ancestral home, as well as in his mother’s homein Ebford, Devon.When Hewitt reported to fight as a tank commander in the first Gulf War in 1991,Diana was frantic about his safety and started using the nickname “Dibbs” forhim in the love letters she would post to the battle zone.Hewitt returned from service safe, but their passion started to wane and Dianaworried their affair would be exposed and she would take full blame for thebreakdown of her marriage to Charles. She stopped taking his calls, but in 1994the affair came back to haunt Diana when Hewitt decided to risk the princess’swrath by selling out.The book he cooperated on with Anna Pasternak, Princess In Love, was packed withgraphic details of their five-year romance.Diana later said she was heartbroken the moneygrubbing soldier had sold her downthe river. She also had to go through explaining to William and Harry what hadhappened before they saw it in newspapers.Diana said:He was a great friend of mine at a very difficult, yet another difficult time,and he was always there to support me. And I was absolutely devastated when thisbook appeared, because I trusted him, and because, again, I worried about thereaction on my children.And, yes, there was factual evidence in the book, but a lot of it was…comes fromanother world…didn’t equate to what happened. There was a lot of fantasy in thatbook, and it was very distressing for me that a friend of mine, who I trusted,made money out of me. I really minded that. And he’d rung me up 10 days beforeit arrived in the bookshops to tell me that there was nothing to worry about,and I believed him, stupidly. And then when it did arrive, the first thing I didwas rush down to talk to my children. And William produced a box of chocolatesand said, “Mommy, I think you’ve been hurt. These are to make you smile again.”But the affair haunts Diana’s sons to this day.Many believe party-loving Hewitt is Harry’s real father as the ginger princebears a striking resemblance to the army officer. Hewitt insists there was “nopossibility whatsoever” he was Harry’s biological father as the boy was alreadya toddler when he came on the scene. Yet others believe he is only protesting ashe fears he could be snuffed out by the royal family.WHERE HE IS NOWAlone, ashamed, ill, and living with his mother. Hated by Diana’s sons, Hewitt,now sixty-two, has never recovered from his moneygrubbing kiss and tell. Afterretiring from the army in 1994, he ran a series of failed business ventures,including a Spanish bar, called the “Polo House” in Marbella, that shut in 2013.He also appeared on reality television shows including 2006’s X Factor: BattleOf The Stars, in which he sang “Addicted To Love” with Rebecca Loos. The fallencad now lives in a two-bedroom apartment near Exeter with his elderly mother,Shirley. He cuts a disconsolate figure on the rare occasions he is seen outshopping. He never married, is reported to have suffered a heart attack andstroke in May 2017, and insiders say he carries the shame of selling out Dianaeverywhere.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------“I felt very protective about James because he…was a very good friend to me, andI couldn’t bear that his life was going to be messed up because he had theconnection with me.”WHOThe Old Friend: James “Squidgygate” GilbeyWHENAffair, 1989–1990WHAT HAPPENEDThe man who made her lonely palace life tolerable, Diana’s next major love sinceHewitt was a gin heir who had known Diana since she was seventeen. Even afterher engagement to Charles, she used to iron James Gilbey’s shirts. Gilbey becameobsessed with Diana when they grew closer in 1989, though she never felt thesame adoration for him that she had lavished on Hewitt. But like the fling withHewitt, this affair involved Diana having to rely on trusted friends to providemore safe houses, places where she could spend hours with her latest maleadmirer, confident of absolute privacy away from the prying eyes of servants.She often used the elegant London home of Mara Berni, owner of her favoriterestaurant, San Lorenzo in Beauchamp Place, for her romps with Gilbey.Her close friend Lucia Flecha de Lima, wife of the Brazilian ambassador, alsogave her the run of her home. It was at Mara’s house—close to Harrods, bought byDodi’s father for $814 million in 1985—that she would meet the mystics,psychics, and fortune-tellers she would become hooked on consulting. Whileseeing Gilbey, she was locked into searching for an answers and solutions to hertangled love life. The hours she spent babbling to Gilbey on her mobilephone—which she called “my talking brick”—would prove the downfall of the fling.When Diana poured out her heart to Gilbey, as she often did, she would rageabout Charles’s affair while oblivious to her own infidelities. In oneincriminating call, she went still further, despairing at the hostility she feltfrom her husband’s family “after all I’ve done for them.” In the same call, shewarned Gilbey that she could not afford to get pregnant with his child, and heburbled affectionate nonsense, calling her “darling” fifty-three times and“Squidgy” or “Squidge” fourteen more.Gilbey may never have kissed and told, but the call made him part of Diana’sembarrassing history of affairs. Three years after her New Year’s Eve 1989 callto Gilbey in which he called her “Squidgy,” a tape of the lovestruckconversation emerged. It surfaced at the height of the crisis in Diana andCharles’s marriage and became known as the “Squidgygate” scandal. The princessconfirmed what happened in her 1995 BBC television interview with Martin Bashir.Asked if she had made the call, she answered, “Yes, we did. Absolutely, we did.”Excerpts of the tape included Diana giggling as she told Gilbey, “I don’t wantto get pregnant.”“Kiss me,” he demands. “Oh God, it’s so wonderful, isn’t it? This sort offeeling? Don’t you like it?”“I love it, I love it,” Diana tells him, getting more frisky when she asked him,“Playing with yourself?”He informs her, “I haven’t played with myself actually—not for a fullforty-eight hours.”Diana bursts into laughter and makes kissing noises, telling Gilbey he’s “thenicest person in the world.”Diana later claimed the tape was leaked by the royals as part of a plot to shameher. She added:It was done to harm me in a serious manner, and that was the first time I’dexperienced what it was like to be outside the net, so to speak, and not be inthe family.It was to make the public change their attitude toward me. It was, you know, ifwe are going to divorce, my husband would hold more cards than I would—it wasvery much a poker game, chess game.Diana was certain her husband’s establishment friends were responsible forleaking the recording. Yet despite Squidgygate, Charles was losing thepopularity war that was being played out between the couple in the media.At the time of the Squidgygate call, Diana had been talking nonstop of escapingthe firm. The scandal—which broke in Britain’s press on August 23, 1992—made hereven more desperate to escape, and she separated from Charles in December 1992.Gilbey then broke up with his fiancée, Lady Alethea Savile, who had stood by himin the furor. In 1994, she died of a drug overdose.WHERE HE IS NOWGilbey, sixty-three, remained single for years after Lady Savile’s death beforemarrying interior designer Lavinia Hadsley-Chaplin in 2014 and is stepfather toher five children. He also runs a property company in London. He has neveropenly spoken of his time with Diana.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------“I was reputed to have made three hundred telephone calls in a very short spaceof time which, bearing in mind my lifestyle at that time, made me a very busylady.”WHOThe Suave Art Dealer: Oliver HoareWHENAffair, 1990–1993WHAT HAPPENEDThere was an extra frisson for Diana in her liaison with this swarthy dealer inPersian artifacts—he was a close friend of Prince Charles. Oliver Hoare, afather-of-three and sixteen years Diana’s senior, was also married. Their affairstarted weeks after Diana’s Squidgygate call to James Gilbey. It also beganafter the death of Diana’s father, Earl Spencer, in March 1992.Hoare, then forty-six years of age, was a friend of Charles, and he and his wifeDiane had been guests at Windsor Castle. He had often hosted Charles duringsummers at the chateau belonging to Hoare’s mother-in-law, in the heart ofProvence.Diana first met him during Ascot week in 1985. The princess was instantlyattracted to him. Darkly good-looking, with thick, wavy black hair that he worelong, he was confident around the royal family where others in the room wereanxious to please. Diana later confessed to her bodyguard Ken Wharfe she hadfelt a little shy when, at Windsor, she shook his hand for the first time, andhad blushed as she flirted with him. That conversation ended abruptly whenCharles and the Queen Mother joined them.When the Waleses’ marriage moved closer to open warfare, Hoare and his wifebegan to act as intermediaries. Diana got together with him after spending hoursadmiring his body while they both worked out at London’s Chelsea Harbour gym.She questioned him constantly, trying to understand what her husband saw inCamilla—whom she called “the Rottweiler.”Hoare then started to spend hours in her private rooms at Kensington Palace, andsoon became a lot more than a friendly shoulder to cry on. The lovers went toextremes to keep their affair private. Shortly after Diana first started seeingthe suave Hoare in 1992, she smuggled him into Kensington Palace in the trunk ofher car, said Wharfe. Ken also once found him one summer evening the same yearcowering naked behind a bay potted plant outside Diana’s apartment door, smokinga cigar. Fumes from his Cuban had set off all the smoke alarms in KensingtonPalace at 3:30 a.m.Ken said:I headed toward the princess’s apartment but before I reached the door Idiscovered the source of the false alarm. Cowering behind a huge plant in thehallway, clutching a cigar, was Oliver Hoare. Diana, who hated the smell ofsmoke, must have sent him out of the bedroom. It was not without a twinge ofamusement at his expense that I advised him to put it out and go back to bed. Helooked almost pathetic as he gathered himself together and left. Next morning, Itried to make a joke of the incident, suggesting that Diana and Hoare had beenplaying cards together in her room—perhaps strip poker.In fact, there is room to suspect that Princess Diana got hooked on bondage andoutdoor sex thanks to Hoare, who “awakened” her sexual desires after years ofmisery married to Prince Charles.The charmer aroused Diana so much she romped with him in the bushes of royalgrounds and once visited him wearing nothing but a fur coat and high heels shecalled her “tart’s trotters.”Wharfe once revealed, “She needed him at every conceivable moment. Dianaconfided to me that he was the first man who had ever aroused her physically.That admission did much to explain the humiliating events that followed.”Another source with intimate knowledge of Diana’s sex life said:She may have seemed demure, but Diana had a wild side that led a lot of aides todub her “Dirty Diana.” She was a virgin when she married Prince Charles and hedid nothing for her sexually. So when the marriage started to crumble, Dianadecided to have fun—a lot of it. Her most passionate fling was with Oliver. Hewas a smooth businessman and she couldn’t get enough of him. Years before FiftyShades came out, they were messing about with bondage and had sex in the bushesaround Diana’s home at Kensington Palace. They went at it like rabbits, andDiana got a real kick out of the danger they could be caught—she cared thatlittle about her marriage to Charles at that stage.Wharfe claimed that over the course of their yearlong affair Diana fell“completely in love” with Hoare. And she once confessed to her close friend LadyBowker, she “daydreamed of living in Italy with handsome Hoare.”In fact, Diana talked obsessively about eventually marrying Hoare and moving toItaly to start a second family with him. But there was a major hitch in herescape plan—Hoare’s wealthy French aristocrat wife Diane de Waldner Hoare, whoended his romance with the royal in 1993 when she threatened divorce. Born intoa family of minor Norfolk landowners, Hoare had worked hard to establish himselfas a dealer in Islamic antiquities. He married Diane in 1976 and struck up afriendship with Prince Charles in 1984, becoming a frequent visitor toHighgrove. Before his fling with Diana, he previously cheated on his wife withAyesha Nadir, the wife of Turkish fugitive tycoon Asil Nadir. When he tried tocall off his affair with Diana to save his marriage and the future in the artworld he had worked so hard to secure, the royal refused to take no for ananswer—and showed further evidence of her mental instability when she becameHoare’s stalker.Hoare’s wife complained to police about more than three hundred late-night“nuisance” calls to her home after she told her husband to finish with Diana.The stream of calls included one in which a woman shouted “a stream of abuse.”Diane insisted her husband ask police to investigate, and cops were stunned todiscover the calls had been made from Diana’s cell phone and private number atKensington Palace. Police ended their inquiries at the request of Hoare, whovowed to speak to Diana when she called again.When she next rang he allegedly shouted at her to shock her into a confession.Yet within days the calls were said to have resumed, from phone boxes inKensington, from the home of Diana’s sister Sarah and Kensington Palace. Dianaadmitted in her famous Panorama interview with Martin Bashir in 1995 that shehad sometimes called Hoare. She said the calls took place “over a period of sixto nine months, a few times, but certainly not in an obsessive manner, no.”But in her bombshell book The Real Diana, royal biographer Lady Colin Campbellclaimed the princess was “almost unhinged with misery and grief” because she waspregnant and had to have an abortion. She also hinted Hoare got Diana pregnantwith her third child, which she secretly aborted after her affair with the artdealer ended—despite dreaming it could be the girl she always wanted. LadyCampbell wrote, “Day and night she’d sit on that telephone calling Oliver’shouse 30, 40, 50 times.”According to Campbell’s account, the princess was desperate to keep a secretbaby, saying to friends, “Suppose it’s a girl.”The book did not go as far as to name the father of the child.When Diana and Hoare’s relationship was made public in August 1994, he admittedonly to having “consoling conversations” with Diana, and the princess, publiclyhumiliated once again, finally cut the art dealer completely out of her life.WHERE HE IS NOWDied on August 23, 2017, aged seventy-three, at his family home in France aftermoving there when he was diagnosed with cancer.But his life post-Diana was not plain sailing.In 2005, he was embroiled in an inquiry into the financial dealings of Qatarisheikh Saud Al Thani. The sheikh was accused of embezzling funds from thecountry by getting vastly inflated invoices sent for art he was buying for theQatar state. Hoare maintained his innocence, as did Al Thani, and chargesagainst the sheikh were eventually dropped.In 2015, Hoare again made headlines when he lost his driving license forseventeen months after being pulled over following a boozy lunch. He is said tohave spent his life despising the fact he was forever tied to Diana andpreferred to move in aristocratic circles and socialize with his art clientsfrom Middle Eastern royalty without ever speaking of the fling.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------“He sent me flowers every week…for three years”WHOThe US Billionaire: Theodore “Teddy” ForstmannWHENAffair, 1994–1995WHAT HAPPENEDThere was a time when it looked like New York billionaire Theodore “Teddy”Forstmann might play Aristotle Onassis to Princess Diana’s poignantly singleJackie Kennedy—one of the royal’s idols.While not blessed with the good looks of a dashing Major James Hewitt or herother lover, swarthy art dealer Oliver Hoare, he was, like Onassis, rich,clever, and more than able to provide private security and private jets—owningnot only a Gulfstream jet, but the company that manufactured them.Like Barry Mannakee, the financier was an older father figure, more than twentyyears her senior and a dealmaking man of the world. In her posthumous biography,The Diana Chronicles, Tina Brown insisted that their relationship was still “onthe boil”—and one of a few options on the hob—when Diana died.Teddy met Diana when he sat next to her during a black-tie dinner thrown by thebanker and grandee Lord Jacob Rothschild during Wimbledon fortnight in 1994.Fittingly, it was at Spencer House, the eighteenth-century London palace builtfor the princess’s ancestor, the first Earl Spencer.The pair bonded over their rampant insecurities. Like Diana, Forstmann grew upwith huge wealth but constantly bickering parents—his father an alcoholic whoterrorized his wife at their estate in Greenwich, Connecticut, and eventuallylost all the family money. And Diana loved how the tycoon had two adopted sonsof his own, Everest and Siya—South African orphans he met through his work as atrustee of the Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund in the 1990s. Forstmann wasalready well into his fifties and unmarried when his fling with Diana began,although he did have a fiancée, a New York model named Debbie Hagerty with whomhe had been for three years.Debbie admitted she was “furious at Diana,” fuming, “For her to pursue my manfor a sexual affair made me so angry. It shocked me because Teddy is differentfrom most men with money. He is so kind and so decent I had never thought of himas a cheater.”After the Spencer House meeting, Forstmann sent Diana flowers every week forthree years. On an early date they had dinner at the Compleat Angler, in Marlow,Bucks, and he was so mesmerized by her that he nearly set fire to the menu.He told Brown that Diana “was a great mother and very bad to herself,” and thatshe’d had fantasies of Forstmann running for president of the United States withherself as his wife and First Lady, ensconced in the White House.When they stayed together at Martha’s Vineyard, Forstmann was two-timing hisfiancée. He sent her a new Lamborghini as a thirtieth birthday present but shewas not impressed when she found out it had been bought while he was with Diana,and dumped him.Forstmann didn’t like the publicity that went with being Diana’s love interest,but did remain close to her until the end of her life. Diana used him as atelephonic sounding-board, asking him, as an older wiser man, what to do abouther war with the royal family, and about her dislike of Camilla and hatred forPrince Philip. She was seeking advice on “tactics,” said Forstmann.A few months before she died in 1997, she asked him to find her a house on thebeach near his in Southampton, Long Island. He found one with a pool on theocean, but it was vetoed by British security.Instead of going there, she spent that fateful summer with the Al-Fayeds. Ifshe’d taken his advice she’d still be alive, Forstmann believed.After Diana, Forstmann’s track record with women moved on to a series of otherimpossibly glamorous women, most notably Elizabeth Hurley and Sir SalmanRushdie’s ex-wife, Padma Lakshmi. Lakshmi—the model, cook, and televisionpresenter—later declared her love for Forstmann and was still with him when hedied.WHERE HE IS NOWDied, seventy-one-years-old, in November 2011 from complications from braincancer after an inoperable tumor was discovered.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------“He was a 10 in bed…it was pure lust.”WHOThe President’s Son: JFK Jr.WHENAlleged One-Night Stand, 1995WHAT HAPPENEDDiana often spoke of the “pure chemistry” between herself and son of former USPresident John F. Kennedy, according to her friend and confidant Simone Simmons.The royal is said to have had a night of passion with JFK Jr. in the New Yorkhotel where the assassinated president had once slept with Marilyn Monroe.The revelation is made in Simmons’s book Diana: The Last Word, and the authorsaid Diana gave Kennedy Jr. a “ten out of ten” rating for his performance in bedand called their session “pure lust.” She claims the princess even fantasizedabout becoming America’s First Lady—just as she had with Teddy Forstmann.The pair met in 1995 when Diana had been separated from Charles for three yearsand the queen was urging her son to obtain a divorce. Kennedy, who had had astring of high-profile romances with celebrities, including actress Daryl Hannahand Madonna, was trying to persuade Diana to give him an interview for hismagazine, George.She refused, but did agree to meet him in her suite at the plush Carlyle Hotelin Manhattan, overlooking Central Park. When Kennedy arrived, Diana was said tohave been “bowled over” by his charm and his toned body. No surprise—he was oncevoted the sexiest man alive.She told Simmons, “We started talking, one thing led to another—and we ended upin bed. It was pure chemistry.”On her return to London, Diana had Kennedy’s astrological chart drawn up andconcluded they were compatible in some ways but not enough to sustain arelationship, Simmons writes. She said the princess confided that Kennedy madeher feel “desirable and womanly.”Simmons added in an interview she found out about Kennedy only by chance.Simmons said, “He came up in a conversation as we spoke about great ladies likeGrace Kelly and Jackie Onassis, who she admired. Diana was laughing at howJackie could have gone from someone as good-looking as JFK to someone froglikelike Aristotle Onassis. Then she sheepishly came out with her John Kennedystory. It left me speechless.”Simmons, who works as an “energy healer,” said Diana often dreamed about takingthe relationship further, the power a relationship with Kennedy Jr. would giveher and how, if everything went to plan, she would become part of America’s“royal family.”The pair stayed in touch for a short while but Diana eventually accepted that itwas not meant to be. The following year, Kennedy married Carolyn Bessette, apublic relations adviser for Calvin Klein.WHERE HE IS NOWDead. Kennedy was killed aged thirty-one in a plane crash in September 1999,almost exactly two years after Diana’s death. His wife Carolyn, thirty-three,and her sister, Lauren Bessette, thirty-four, were killed with him when theirsix-seater plane, piloted by Kennedy, crashed in the Atlantic fog. The group hadbeen on their way from New York to one of Diana’s favorite holiday spots,Martha’s Vineyard, when the plane made a series of turns and plunged out of thesky.The cause of the accident has never been established.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------“Isn’t he just drop-dead gorgeous? He’s my Mr. Wonderful.”WHOThe Heart Surgeon: Hasnat KhanWHENRelationship (which Diana hoped would end in marriage), 1995–1997WHAT HAPPENEDThey met in September 1995 during the final throes of Diana’s marriage toCharles. She saw Khan—aptly a heart surgeon—as the man who would heal herwounds. For Diana, it was love at first sight. She reportedly gushed to friends,“Isn’t he drop-dead gorgeous? He’s my Mr. Wonderful.”She went on to refer to the serious, quiet, thirty-five-year-old Pakistani heartsurgeon as “The One.”He was, in fact, the oldest of four children from an affluent, tight-knit,upper-middle-class family in Jhelum, north of Lahore. Diana met him at the RoyalBrompton Hospital, where she had gone to visit the husband of hersoother-in-chief, the Irish nurse-cum-acupuncturist Oonagh Shanley-Toffolo.Joseph Toffolo had suffered a massive hemorrhage during a triple-bypassoperation.Dr. Khan, the senior resident working with the distinguished surgeon ProfessorSir Magdi Yacoub, was in attendance.Here, in an edited extract from her book The Diana Chronicles, Tina Browndissects this major relationship:Khan, a young Omar Sharif lookalike in a white coat, appealed to Diana’s tastefor the exotic combined with the caring.When he arrived with his retinue of assistants while Diana was at Joseph’sbedside, the doctor was entirely absorbed in the patient’s condition and tooklittle notice of the princess—which, for a woman used to having everyone fawnover her, was almost unbearably sexy. So was the blood on his operating shoes,and so were his caring, expressive eyes.“Oonagh, isn’t he drop-dead gorgeous,” Diana hissed after Khan had left theroom. So gorgeous, in fact, that the bemused Joseph had Diana fussing over himat his bedside for seventeen days straight.In no time, the Kensington Palace apartment was fragrant with the scent ofburning joss sticks. Diana turned herself into a student of cardiology—her nighttable groaning under a phonebook-sized copy of Gray’s Anatomy and piles ofsurgical reports.They were above Diana’s pay grade, and instead she took to watching UK hospitalsoap opera Casualty, believing it was the easiest way to keep abreast of medicalterms and developments.Her closet also quickly filled with a colorful selection of shalwar kameezes,the silk tunics and trousers worn by Pakistani women. She even consideredconverting to Islam.Diana took to meeting with Dr. Khan in his small overnight room at the RoyalBrompton Hospital.She asked if she could watch him perform open-heart surgery.“Anybody with courage enough to watch a heart operation can come in,” Khan toldher.He couldn’t keep her away after that.Awkwardly, in late November 1995, a photographer from the News of the Worldcaught Diana at the hospital at midnight. She was due to meet Khan as he cameoff his shift. Borrowing the photographer’s mobile phone, she spoke to thepaper’s royal correspondent, Clive Goodman (nicknamed “the Eternal Flame” by hiscolleagues because he never left the office).She told Goodman it was true, she was at the hospital comforting terminally illpatients. She did it, she told him, up to four hours a night, three times aweek.Goodman bit. The headline in News Of The World four days later was “My SecretNights As An Angel.”The story gave birth to an eerie new image of Diana as a compulsive ambulancechaser and death groupie.Satirical British magazine Private Eye came up with a “Diana-no Card,” whichsaid, “I, the undersigned, wish to make it clear that in the event of anyinjury, mental breakdown, life-threatening disease, or other such personaltragedy, I do not wish under any circumstances to be visited by the Princess ofWales.”As her relationship with Khan grew, Diana confessed to her friend Lady Bowker,widow of the diplomat Sir James Bowker, “I found my peace.”And the doctor didn’t want anything from her. She reportedly offered to buy hima new car, and he proudly refused. Khan was not interested in high life orfashionability, and he had a dread of personal publicity. His one-bedroomapartment in Chelsea was a mess, and there was a bit of a paunch under the oldT-shirts he wore when he was off duty.He loved what was best about Diana—her compassionate nature, her desire toembrace humanitarian causes.Diana intended to turn the former equerry’s room in her apartment at KensingtonPalace into a basement den for “Natty,” as she called Khan, so that he could sitaround watching soccer after grueling surgery sessions. On weekends, when herstaff was off, she would try her hand at cooking him dinner.“Marks & Spencer have got these very clever little meals that you just put inthe microwave and you put the timer on and press the button and it’s done foryou!” she marveled to psychic Simone Simmons.She would sometimes disappear for a whole day to Khan’s apartment, where shecontentedly vacuumed, did the dishes, and ironed his shirts.On the night of her thirty-sixth birthday in July 1997, she reportedly went outto meet Khan wearing her best sapphire-and-diamond earrings, a fur coat, and,underneath, nothing. Her butler, Paul Burrell, helped run the affair behind thescenes. If there was a lovers’ quarrel, he would deliver a message to a pubwhere Khan hung out, near the hospital.Khan was also smuggled into Kensington Palace in the trunk of Diana’scar—clutching a KFC bucket for dinner à deux with the princess, who loved the“ordinariness” of the fast food meal.Diana would also meet Khan in pubs and jazz clubs. One of their favorite spotswas London jazz club Ronnie Scott’s. Diana would disguise herself in a black wigand glasses, and thrilled to the excitement of standing undetected in a line atRonnie’s.“I’m queuing!” she squealed into her “talking brick” mobile phone to Simmons.“It’s wonderful!”Things got more serious when Diana started to make trips to Pakistan whenevershe could to bone up on Hasnat’s heritage. Her new best friend became JemimaKhan, the beautiful daughter of Annabel and Jimmy Goldsmith. At the time Jemimaknew Diana, she was a coltish twenty-two-year-old, married to the Pakistanicricket legend Imran Khan. The two women would sit up talking late into thenight about how to handle marriage to a traditional-minded Muslim.Diana then asked her butler Burrell to talk to a priest about the possibility ofa secret marriage to Hasnat. The butler had a meeting with Father Tony Parsonsat the Roman Catholic Carmelite Church, on Kensington Church Street, whereBurrell’s son was an altar boy.Fr. Parsons told him it was impossible to marry a couple without notifying theauthorities—let alone without notifying the fiancé, as it turned out. Khan wasaghast when he learned of Burrell’s consultation and said to Diana, “Do youhonestly think you can just bring a priest here and get married?”But Diana was relentless in her pursuit of marrying the doctor. In February1996, Diana went to Pakistan with Annabel Goldsmith and her niece, CosimaSomerset, to visit Jemima and Imran in Lahore. The ostensible purpose of thevisit was to raise funds for the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital,founded by Imran in memory of his mother, who had died from the disease.The real purpose was to flood the zone with images that would wow Hasnat’sfamily and show him she was serious minded and passionate about good causes.Some suspect she latched onto campaigning against land mines simply to impressher new love.Yet Khan was slipping away. He didn’t want to go public. He didn’t want to marryher. He couldn’t face the onslaught of becoming “Diana’s new guy” in everytabloid newspaper. And he recoiled from the prospect of his work at the hospitalbeing invaded by reporters.But he kept up the relationship as he had grown fond of her boys. He got on wellwith William and Harry—especially William, who had had a long session gettingcareer advice from him one weekend.But Khan knew his family would also have made marriage a practicalimpossibility, despite the fairy tales Diana was dreaming their future held.Khan was a Pathan, a member of a group of peoples in Pakistan and Afghanistandescended from warriors and notable for their fierce attachment to theircultural traditions. His parents had tried twice, in 1987 and 1992, to marry himoff to a suitable Muslim bride with equivalent social standing, and by 1996 theywere impatient to try again.Again, Diana was trying to enter a dysfunctional family that did not really wanther.In an interview with the Sunday Express, Hasnat’s father, Rashid Khan, offered abruising assessment of Diana as a bridal prospect for his son. “He is not goingto marry her,” the elder Khan said.“We are looking for a bride for him. She must belong to a respectable family.She should be rich, belonging to upper middle class. But if we do not find herin our own tribe, we can try outside it. But preferably she should be at least aPakistani Moslem girl.”Diana saw the declaration as a challenge, but it was hopeless.In May 1997, Diana upset Khan by using the cover of a three-day trip to Pakistanto raise funds for Imran Khan’s cancer hospital in order to descend withoutnotice on Hasnat’s sprawling family in an upscale suburb of Lahore.They clustered around and took her picture and served her English tea until asimultaneous power and water failure drove them outside to sit in a circle inthe garden of their walled compound, making pleasant, if stilted, conversationwith the charming stranger from the United Kingdom.It was a surreal scene, especially when one considers that Diana picturedherself moving in with them as their new daughter-in-law. Diana not only hadKhan’s family and centuries of tradition against her. Hasnat’s pager would gooff twenty times a day on his medical rounds; his job would always come first.Amazingly, for a woman who portrayed herself as one of the world’s mostempathetic figures, Diana was strangely blind when it came to those of thepeople closest to her. She wanted to own his future, arrange his life. Shewanted to rearrange his surgical schedule so that he could travel with her.The essayist Clive James wrote in The New Yorker about Diana’s neediness: “Shebelieved, against all the evidence that there was some kind of enchanted placecalled ‘abroad,’ where she could be understood and where she could lead a morenormal life.”Her hunt for this utopia was taking her to Pakistan, and even to NorthernIreland, where she believed she could help solve the Troubles. She also dreamedof moving to America where she believed her famous face would get lost in thesea of Hollywood stars and lead to eventual anonymity.She also dreamed of lifting Hasnat out of the annoying grind and insane hours ofthe Brompton Hospital into some medical habitat where they could live togetherin sunny exile with a swimming pool, possibly in Australia or South Africa.At an international think-tank dinner in Rimini, Italy, she found herself nextto Professor Christiaan Barnard, the septuagenarian heart-transplant pioneer.She lobbied him hard to get Hasnat a position in South Africa and twice gave himdinner at Kensington Palace to discuss Hasnat’s future. Proud Dr. Khan wentballistic, when, on finally meeting Barnard, he was asked to submit his résumé.But the breaking point for Khan perhaps came when a Sunday Mirror story on June29, 1997 alleged he and Diana had become unofficially engaged after the“astonishing family summit that sealed their love” in Pakistan in May.Khan decided it was over. He arranged to meet Diana in an agreed-upon spot inHyde Park at 10 p.m. one hot night in the second week of July. Knowing she wasto be rejected, Diana reproached him with tears and a furious tirade. She couldnot really accept that it was over, but Khan was sure it was the end.In August the Khan family, returning to Lahore, gave Hasnat gifts for thebeautiful princess who had visited them. He told them to mail them to herinstead. He wouldn’t be seeing Diana anymore.Khan told his family, “If I married her, our marriage would not last for morethan a year. We are culturally so different from each other. She is from Venusand I am from Mars. If it ever happened, it would be like a marriage from twodifferent planets.”The end of their discreet two-year relationship sent Diana disastrously into thearms of Dodi. Her close friend Rosa Monckton said Diana was “very much in lovewith” the shy physician and thought romancing the playboy would make the surgeonso jealous he would plead to get her back.Another reason Diana chose Dodi was that she had come to realize that, in themultimedia age, downsizing was unfeasible. She may also have subconsciouslyrealized she would have died of boredom living in Khan’s humble house waitingfor him to return from grueling surgical shifts.And so Diana—like her role model Jackie Kennedy, who tried to re-create thefortress of the American presidency with the playthings of her second husband,Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Socrates Onassis—fell into the arms of a modernkind of prince who could underwrite the trappings of her celebrity status.It turned out to be the definition of a fatal attraction.WHERE HE IS NOWAfter Diana’s death, Khan, now sixty-one, moved to Lahore and had an arrangedmarriage in 2006. The couple divorced within eighteen months.Now back in Britain, Khan said in 2013, “It’s been difficult for me to get myhead around Diana’s death. After she died, things were difficult, verydifficult. We all have our own traumas and get on with it. But when it’s therein your face year in, year out, it’s hard.”He is now listed as a consultant cardiac surgeon at Basildon and ThurrockUniversity Hospitals and is believed to be single.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------“The amazing thing about Dodi is that he makes me feel so beautiful. No man hasever done that to me.”WHOThe Playboy: Dodi FayedWHEN 1997WHAT HAPPENEDTo Diana, forty-two-year-old Dodi Fayed seemed perfectly cast for a romance ofretaliation against both her ex-lover Khan and the royals. As her friend LordPalumbo put it, “She just wanted to make the people at Balmoral as angry aspossible.”Her choice of agent provocateur was everything blue-blooded snobs detested—anew-moneyed Egyptian heir.Like Diana, Dodi’s parents divorced when he was young (age two), with his fatherMohamed Al-Fayed winning custody—despite the tycoon almost never being home.Dodi grew into a loner, then a playboy who filled the void left by an emptychildhood with cocaine and hangers-on. Diana biographer Tina Brown said, “Heloved to cook Middle Eastern dishes with his butler, perfume his apartment withscented lilac candles, listen intently at the feet of movie stars, and do linesof cocaine.”When Dodi was twenty-four, his father set him up in a film company, which meanthe could date actresses and call himself an executive producer. He got luckywith his very first project, David Puttnam’s Oscar-winning Chariots of Fire, inwhich his father invested $2.6 million. It gave him the right to hang around theset until Puttnam threw him off—for handing out coke to the cast.His house in Beverly Hills was party central, a magnet for freeloaders, golddiggers, and deal jockeys exploiting his childlike generosity. He threw, onaverage, four parties a week.The playboy became a regular at Manhattan’s Studio 54, where supermodels, popstars, and Hollywood legends got high on drugs and often had sex in hiddencorners of the sprawling club, according to Mark Fleischman in his 2017 memoirInside Studio 54.“Dodi loved Quaaludes, good quality coke, and hot women, and he always hadplenty of those,” wrote Fleischman, who owned the club between 1981 and ’84.The two men became so close that they regularly went scouring illegal gay clubsat 5 a.m. in what was then one of the most dangerous areas of downtown New York.Dubbed the “dawn patrol,” the duo and a posse of celebrity drug-abusers,including singers Liza Minnelli, Rick James, and Joe Cocker, tennis ace VitasGerulaitis, and Hollywood giants Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Robin Williams, JohnBelushi, and Nick Nolte would take limos to impromptu parties in boarded-upbuildings.“Dodi always had the most amazing coke,” Fleischman added.By the time Dodi met Diana, he had only quieted down a bit. He was still arestless, unreliable cocaine addict—with the only survivor of the crash thatkilled him and Diana, Trevor Rees-Jones, saying he infuriated chauffeurs byturning up late, could barely sit still, and always urged his drivers to speedthrough streets as he hated sitting in traffic.In the course of his six-week relationship with Diana, he showered her with amultistranded seed-pearl bracelet, a Jaeger-LeCoultre wristwatch studded withdiamonds, a silver photo frame with a romantic inscription, and a gold dressring with pavé diamonds that was on her finger at the time of the accident.On the first Al-Fayed vacation at his Saint-Tropez estate in July, with Williamand Harry in tow, Dodi was still dating his red-hot Calvin Klein model andfiancée Kelly Fisher.Rees-Jones said, “Diana could do miles better than this guy, for Christ’s sake.”Diana and Dodi first went public with their relationship when they showed uptogether at Lucas Carton restaurant in Paris on July 25, 1997.Two weeks later they were spotted cuddling on a $32 million yacht off Sardinia.Snaps of Diana and Dodi getting intimate had a devastating effect in the UK.Others believe she was only hoping to make her ex-boyfriend, Dr. Haznet Kahn,and even Charles jealous. Either way, sparks flew between her and Dodi—and Dianadared cameras to document her happiness.Then fifteen-year-old Prince William burst into tears when they were publishedand had to be consoled on the phone by his mother as he was dreading thecommentary from schoolmates when he returned to Eton for the autumn term. Theymay also have had the desired effect by enraging the queen—but they sent Diana’sex, Khan, running farther for the hills. Many of Diana’s pals believed she setup the pictures, wrongly believing they would make her heart surgeon love sojealous he would sweep back into her life with an engagement ring.Instead, it was the sort of headline-grabbing display that left Khan breathing asigh of relief that he had escaped her life-sapping whirlwind of drama and fame.Days before her ill-fated final holiday with Dodi, Diana had been campaigningagainst land mines in Bosnia. But the final weeks of her life were spent seeingMohamed Al-Fayed desperately showing off his toys to Diana as he saw her as histicket into the British “establishment” he both hated and desperately wanted tobe inducted into. However, the restored mansion in Bois de Bologne that oncebelonged to the Windsors that Mohamed Al-Fayed said he would give to his son andDiana spooked the princess, and she stayed only ten minutes when she visited theestate the day before her death.As writer Tina Brown said, “It cut too close to the bone for her to linger at aplace of royal exile, while her boys were nestling in the bosom of the Windsorfamily at Balmoral and she was floating, Wallis-Simpson-like, around thepleasure spots of the Mediterranean. The ghosts of the Windsor house tour onlycontributed to her longing to get the hell out of Paris and go home.”Before she could get back to the UK, she endured a final act of bedlamorchestrated by cocaine addict Dodi—the fatal decision to recruit Henri Paul todrive them away from his father’s Ritz Hotel in Paris.Diana told paparazzi, who watched her and Dodi holidaying during her finalsummer, they were going to be “surprised with the next thing I’ll do”—fuelingrumors she was going to marry Dodi. But at the inquest into Diana’s death, RosaMonckton testified that her friend died in love with Khan, saying she was stillinfatuated with the surgeon at the time of her death. She said Diana was “deeplyupset and hurt” when he broke off with her in the summer of 1997, adding, “Dianahoped that they would be able to have a future together. She wanted to marryhim.”WHERE HE IS NOWDodi was originally interred in Brookwood Cemetery near Woking, Surrey, justbefore midnight the day he died, in accordance with Muslim tradition. However,he was disinterred and reinterred on the grounds of the Fayed estate in Oxted,Surrey, in October of 1997.Dodi’s father has also famously erected two memorials to his son and Diana atHarrods. The first, unveiled on April 12, 1998, consists of photos of the twobehind a pyramid-shaped display that holds a wineglass still smudged withlipstick from Diana’s last dinner, as well as a ring Dodi purchased the daybefore they died believed to be an early engagement ring for Diana, boughtbefore Dodi was going to tell her to choose her own.The second tribute, unveiled in 2005 and titled “Innocent Victims,” is anine-foot-high bronze statue of the two dancing on a beach, beneath the wings ofan albatross. (The statue would ultimately be removed in 2018 by new owners ofHarrods in Knightsbridge, where it had previously been located, and returned toAl-Fayed.) The memorials were designed by eighty-year-old Bill Mitchell, a closefriend of Dodi’s father and the architect for Harrods for more than forty years.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------In addition to the suitors profiled here, there is evidence for another kind ofrelationship that Diana may have had “waiting in the wings.” Thoughunbelievable—or even unfathomable—for most people, there is reason to believethe litany of men associated with Diana does not quite end here. This isbecause, despite being believed to have accepted Dodi’s proposal the night shewas killed, Diana was already secretly making plans to date two other men as“insurance” against their relationship failing like all her others.From the Jonikal yacht, she was deep in discussions with the Chineseentrepreneur David Tang, who was helping her make plans for a three-day visit toHong Kong in September. He died at age sixty-three in 2017—days before thetwentieth anniversary of Diana’s crash.Diana’s new interest in China was also stoked by Gulu Lalvani. The HongKong-based electronics entrepreneur, now eighty, was founder of Binatone, acompany valued at some $572 million. The Monday before her accident, Diana hadmade plans from the Jonikal to see him on her return to London. At that point,she and Lalvani had been seeing each other a couple of times a week.It was his appearance in her life that caused Diana’s last breach in the springof 1997 with her mother, who exploded on the phone about her daughter’s multiple“relationships with Muslim men.” (Lalvani was actually a Punjabi Sikh, but, asfar as Diana’s mother was concerned, he was still unacceptably brown.)A blind person could see the patterns here. Married men. Taken men. Men withties to the military. Men with qualities that would make the royal establishmentuncomfortable.Diana was no respecter of convention. Her choice of men makes this abundantlyclear. When she chose, she chose dangerously. Perhaps this was part of theattraction for her. Whatever the case, it is also clear that her actionsregarding men indicated that she was not a person who could be controlled. Shewould have what she wanted—when she wanted—and was clearly willing to make verydangerous choices when necessary to get it.Back in 1997, Colin continued his investigations, with no clue that he hadstumbled in at the very end of a long story when it came to the men in thedeceased princess’s life…and so much more.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------DETECTIVE’S NOTEBOOKDATELINE: Third day at crime scene, September 1997With my recent bout of restlessness, I formulated a plan to get my sleepinghabits into a routine. Having programmed my alarm clock for the crack of dawn, Iturned in for the night. As daybreak peeped through the curtains, I headedstraight to the scene. The three-mile walk seemed to get me going for the day,to shake off the jet lag. I needed to get myself into the scene, into the puzzleagain, among the mourners. There were always at least a dozen or more soulskeeping the vigil, flowers in hand, no matter the weather or the time of day. Itwas humbling to witness the outpouring. Grief from so many that, like me, hadnever even met Princess Diana. I stopped, just as you do when you enter a churchor a law court. The dignity that this stretch of road now commanded wasunfathomable. I then began to walk. I strolled the approach and the tunnelentrance over and over. I ambled up and down the many surrounding side streetsand laneways looking for clues, anything that might provide a new slant on myinvestigation. I tilted my head upward, noting the many windows that overlookedthe scene, apartments with ideal vantage points. Were there any wakefulresidents on the night of the accident? Anyone who may have brushed aside theirdrapes for a breath of fresh air and seen the taillights of a doomed Mercedes?After a brief breakfast at a nearby brasserie café, it was time for me to burnsome shoe leather. Time to get back to basics, the stuff of the traditionaldetective: knocking on all the doors in the region. I stood at the edge of theriver and glanced at what lay ahead, hundreds of windows and far too many doors.I figured there was at least two days’ solid work in front of me, and I wonderedhow on earth I’d get through this impossible task. I decided it would be acarefully constructed blend of front and bluff. The front would be the verygumption of knocking on each and every door and the bluff would be the ultimatetest to my past undercover police skills: pretending to be a curious Australian,an amateur sleuth with a healthy interest in unraveling the accident that killedPrincess Diana. I paced around by the river rehearsing my covert story, as Iused to do a couple of years earlier when I was really undercover, ingratiatingmyself with crooks, drug dealers, and murderers. But this time around I’d be upagainst the smarts of the French, no easy targets, I thought.The first building I tackled was at the mouth of the merge lane. Directlyoverlooking the accident site, it appeared to be an apartment block forwell-to-do Parisians. It was. Starting with the lower levels first, I buzzed theground-floor security button. The voice of what audibly was a little old ladywith absolutely no command of the English language replied through a tinyspeaker. We verbally wrestled with our respective tongues before she fell quiet.Moments later a pair of fine metal spectacles with the predicted elderly womanclose behind peeped cautiously at me from between a pair of lace curtains.Thinking fast, I began waving my hands, pointing to the roadway and the tunnel,making a motion like holding a steering wheel. I pulled my passport from mytrouser pocket and held it up to the window before performing an encore of mypantomime. My little old lady let go of her curtains and disappeared. My heartsank. I paced a few steps back toward the street and tilted my head upward,looking for any signs of life at one of the other overlooking windows. No suchluck, this covert gig was looking tough, I thought. How was I ever going to makeany progress without a fluency in the native dialect of the locals?As I pondered the arduousness of the task before me I heard a click and theheavy old-world security door released. Filled with a second wind, I bolted inbefore my benefactor could reconsider. My eyes adjusted quickly to the dimmerlight and I scanned the hall for her front door. The kind old dear was standingon her threshold sporting a neat chignon of gray hair and the faintest ofsmiles. Over a cup of chamomile tea we play acted our way through an awkwardconversation, but one that got results in the end. Maybe this was all going towork out after all?I managed to communicate that I was from Australia and very saddened by thedeath of Princess Diana. I was wondering if she had heard the collision or seenthe aftermath. A watch, notepad, and some stick figure sketches later and Iascertained that she was asleep at the time of the accident, had woken to thenoise of sirens, before seeing the flashing emergency vehicle lights. Sheobserved the progress of those assisting for an hour or so before going back tobed. Basically, she’d seen nothing that could help me. In fact she wasn’t evenaware that the accident had involved Princess Diana until lunchtime of thefateful day, when she had tuned her radio box to the daily news.Sadly, she had little more to offer than her charm and her grandmotherly smile.She did, however, walk me through her apartment block and fill me in on who wasin residence and, by pointing to her wristwatch, what was the best time to tapon their individual doors. I thanked her and persisted, door after door, throughthe building and onto the neighboring apartment block.On each successive door knock one common feature of the apartments became moreand more obvious. Despite their proximity to the roadway, it was near impossiblefor occupants to look down on the tunnel entrance, to get a clear view. Fullymature elm trees lined Cours Albert and the highway. And each of the trees atthis time of the year bore a full head of lush green foliage that acted as acanopy and effectively hindered any observation of the roadway from above. Mostof the residents pointed this out to me as I spoke to them in their apartments;a few even suggested that I lean from their windows to see for myself. The mostI could hope for was someone who had heard the accident. As it turned out therewere only a mere handful of those, offering little more than corroboration ofthe time of the accident. I spoke to as many residents as I could locate inthose two grand old buildings over the next days, returning time and time again.I managed to fill my notebook with a run of check marks but no revelations.Despite my lack of success in the information stakes, at least my covert skillswere working, I kept at it.Some 50 yards farther along was the structure I named “apartment block three.”Draped in scaffold and completely derelict, this building was undergoing athorough refurbishment at the time of the accident. Of little interest to myinvestigation for that reason, the construction site did however provide abuffer between the first two inhabited apartment blocks and three buildings thatwould prove to be the enigmas of my investigation. The immediate neighbor, theChamber of Commerce International, bordered the impressive Embassy of Brazil andflanked, in the position furthest from the crime scene, the Embassy of theRepublic of Congo. Here we had a run of diplomatic offices sitting side by side,each flying their nation’s flags, each within feet of the merge lane and eachwithin feet of the skid marks that scarred the main highway. I strode up anddown that short stretch of Cours Albert and surveyed their individual facadesuntil I was tired of looking at them.My attention was captured by the central structure that was the embassy ofBrazil. Three stories high, with twenty or so windows fronting the street, thisgrand chateau style building at 34 Cours Albert was fortified by a nearly9-foot-high masonry wall. And capping this was a further 61/2 feet ofspike-topped wrought iron neatly disguised by a lush hedge of greenery. But itwasn’t this serious security or the pair of matching metal gates at each end ofthe allotment that had me transfixed. It was the fact that what lay behind thosegates and behind the watchful eyes of the security cameras mounted high on thewalls above, was a substantial driveway. A driveway wide enough for a vehicle, Ithought.Almost on cue, the hefty Brazilian gates swung open and a small vehicle rumbledout, passed me, and slowly dribbled onto the merge lane. I craned my neck tryingfor a closer look inside. There appeared to be a marshaling area around to therear of the building through a side archway from whence the car must haveoriginated. The building that occupied the Chamber of Commerce International hadno driveway, garage door, or car parking area, nor had the building that housedthe Congo Embassy, nor indeed my little old lady’s apartment block or itsimmediate neighbor. I rapidly pushed them all to the back of my mind. There waslittle doubt that a second car had entered the highway from the merge lane onthe night of August 31. And there was little doubt that same car had played aninstrumental part in the accident that subsequently occurred claiming the livesof three people. The relationship between this embassy driveway and that mergelane was now seriously teasing the mind of this detective.With my goal of documenting the area thoroughly, I decided it best nonethelessto sketch the relationship of each building to the mouth of the merge. So, halfan hour later, having measured and photographed and made numerous notations, Iclosed my notebook with the task completed. Glancing upward at the sound of asong of starlings in the trees, I met a metal eye peering back at me, seeminglymonitoring my every move. No doubt its lens would have zoomed in on my tape,notebook, and camera. Now overtly conscious that the security guards withinwould have been swapping comments on my recent antics, readying responses for myinevitable pressing of their intercom, I decided not to be predictable, not topress a buzzer, and stir a rehearsed answer. Instead, I packed away my gear andwithout a second look back at their fortified home I headed farther along CoursAlbert to another string of apartment buildings. Back to tapping on doors, butones whose occupants I hoped would offer up genuine responses.Next up was an office building which was the home to France Channel 3. Thenetwork’s blue cube logo burned brightly on the façade that was also home to theoffice of the Vietnamese Embassy and an assortment of small businesses. Anotherrun of apartments and I found myself at No. 20, which was a building undergoingsignificant construction. Here I found what would be the only other vehicularaccessible building, but as yet it was unserviceable. I scratched it off my listand turned into Rue Baynard. A one-way street steering traffic away from CoursAlbert and pointing it toward the area known as the eighth arrondissement, Isurmised it unlikely that a vehicle would have traveled the wrong way down it touse the merge lane. However, I knocked on each door and asked my usual questionsregardless.My third door was answered by a very chatty Englishman who confirmed myfindings. He had been in his homeland at the time of the accident, but he wasable to clarify that the majority of his neighboring apartments were utilized byforeign governments to house visiting personnel. I coined it the “diplomaticzone.” From Rue Baynard I walked along both sides of Rue Jean Goujon, wearingdown the skin on the knuckles of my right hand. I noted comments, placed checkmarks, and talked through the accident with anyone who would give me fiveminutes. Having completed the entire block, I found myself dismayed at howlittle people seemed to care about the death of the once-to-be queen of England.Most just voiced what trifles they knew or saw and brushed it aside. In short, Idiscovered nothing that I didn’t already know.It was now quite late, yet the overpass to the tunnel was still awash withpilgrims. I hunted out a quintessential café on the small square overlooking thePont de l’Alma, found a seat, and stared at the landscape of dying flowers andfallen tissues. Chez Francis was doing a roaring trade. It was adelightful-looking brasserie, with its street-side seats that afforded the idealviews of the Eiffel Tower. It serviced hundreds of extra clients each day, allin need of the outlook, coffee and croissants, and a toilet break from theirmourning.As I sat, I began to speculate what-ifs. What if a late-night guest had thissame seat on that fateful Saturday in August? What if they’d heard the crash,perhaps even run to the tunnel to lend a hand? The waiter who took my order thisevening had greeted me in English. His name was Roland, and I seized theopportunity to try out my hypothesis. Yes, he said the brasserie was still openafter midnight of that night, however there were only the staff lumbered withcleaning up still in attendance. No diners, I thought, but what about thosestaff? As luck would have it, Roland was one of that team. However, he wasembarrassed to admit, he had paid scant attention to the commotion.He suggested that I wander back this coming Saturday night and inquire of hisguests. Many of the late nighters, he continued, were regulars who called thebrasserie their “local.” Perhaps some had been among those who had gathered onthe overpass roof of the tunnel to witness the removal of the twisted mess ofmetal, rubber, leather, and human flesh. Those sightseers had to have come fromsomewhere, I thought. It was certainly possible that a stroll home at the end ofan evening out could have been interrupted by the sight or sound of theaccident. I surmised correctly that my waiter had not been among the spectators,a fact he confirmed. In a hurry to be home after along day’s work, Rolandrecounted, he had no interest in that sort of thing.I persevered with my door knocking. By the end of my first week, although I hadspoken to well over two hundred people, I had learned relatively little. Nonehad seen anything that could possibly advance the investigation. The task hadbeen draining and long; my only consolation that I had at least checked it off.But now I seemed to have run out of leads. So I took Roland’s advice and foundmyself a central table at his establishment on my first Saturday night in Paris.It’s well known among those in law enforcement that to visit a crime scene atthe same time and on the same day of the week as the incident can often lead toremarkable insights. People are by and large creatures of habit, and thosehabits extend to doing the same thing at the same time and often routinely onthe same day. So here I was positioned perfectly for just such an occurrence. Imust have consumed several liters of mineral water during the course of thatevening as successive locals came and went. His regulars were a thoroughlydecent group. Disappointingly, after all the chat and bonhomie, I still hadnothing by way of a witness. Reluctant to write off the experience as a completefailure, I decided to take the opportunity to pay a visit to the Brazilianembassy. It was still niggling away at me.It was well after 10 p.m. when I arrived at the front. I took a seat across theway beneath a tree and in the dark of the night. I lingered, watching andwaiting. Above the wall of green and steel I could see a few of the upstairswindows were open. The occasional chirp of faint laughter emanating from thewindows hinted that a function was underway. I listened to the sounds of a smallcrowd as below I observed security guards patrolling the grounds with dogs. Istretched my legs several times over the next couple of hours, changing myvantage position and pondering the likelihood of such an event having occurredon another Saturday night in recent history. Just then the big metal securitydoors opened briefly, let out a car, and then closed again.A guard was leaning his shoulder on the bars next to the gate, smoking. A leancanine crouched at his heels and cocked its head quizzically at me. I approachedthe gate. Pleased to find a sympathetic ear to his long hours pacing the smallgrounds, he and I struck up a brief conversation. I nodded understandingly andoffered, “too bad” in appropriate silences. These gatherings went on all thetime, he bemoaned and I commiserated. Perhaps he had found a break from theroutine with the events of August 31? While he hadn’t been on duty that night,the security officer went on to happily inform me that, “yes” they had indeedhad a function on the night of the accident. Bingo! I attempted to find out moreabout the function, only to be given the descriptive “diplomatic.” My guardfriend for the moment had little else to offer me and I realized I was merely aman in the street he chose to speak briefly to as he sneaked himself acigarette.Then it was time to get back to work; he moved off to escort another vehiclesafely from the compound and I shuffled off down the street. I would get littlemore from the man with the mean dog.By the time the last of the embassy lights were turned out, I had observed adozen or so vehicles depart the grounds. Two of them were Fiats. I watchedthoughtfully as all of the cars traveled the 20 meters to the merge lane andturned onto the main roadway, then through the underpass and into the night,just as I had believed was the case on the night Princess Diana’s car came togrief. My shift of sticky-nose surveillance ended with a slow walk home.I spent the subsequent Saturday night huddled near the merge lane, at the samehour, looking toward the Brazilian embassy and the service lane out the front.As I waited, spying on that unremarkable little road, I couldn’t help but lockmy eyes onto the security doors of the embassy and track the path of theoccasional exiting motorcar. Perhaps they were embassy staff driving home, maybeofficials at the end of their busy day, or a guest heading wherever, tired andunsure of the dangers that lay ahead as the merge lane met the main roadway.Eventually I suffered my lone, tired thoughts and headed home myself, back to myhotel room.CHAPTER SIXAugust 31, 1997.A more ominous date in Diana’s life, there never was.As it does for all of us, death came for Diana. But for the beautiful princess,it came tragically and horribly, and wrapped in unbelievable mystery.That evening, Diana slipped away to shop briefly on the elegant Avenue desChamps-Élysées. By 9 p.m., she and Dodi were seated at L’Espadon. The moon wasout and the stars were shining over Paris. A balmy breeze brushed the leaves ofthe manicured ficus trees around Diana and Dodi’s table. After dinner, thecouple decided to drive to the fabulous villa they planned to make their lovenest after they married, according to the Fayed family.“They were going to live in Chateau Windsor—the house where the duke and duchessof Windsor spent their exile after he abdicated as King of England,” one insidertold this book.It was in 1986 that Dodi’s father bought the historic villa in the Bois deBoulogne for $7 million.Our insider added:Dodi’s father bought the house after the duchess died and he spent millionsrestoring it to the glory it had when the Windsors were the toast of Paris.He restored antiques, bought expensive rugs in exactly the same design as theold ones—and even had the duchess’s underwear drawer restocked. He wanted it tobe just like the way it was in the Windsors’ day—a museum dedicated to them.Dodi insisted they make their home there after his son confided in him he was tomarry Diana. He immediately made plans to sell the priceless antiques, rugs, anddrapes. Dodi was talking about having several children with Diana and a museumwould have been no place to bring them up.It was just after midnight when the couple left the Ritz.Dodi set in motion a game of cat-and-mouse with the horde of photographerssurrounding the front entrance.He asked his usual chauffeur to drive away in his limo, which was parked infront of the hotel as a decoy, in the hope the photographers would follow.Immaculately dressed in spotless white trousers, at around 12:15 a.m., Dianaclimbed into the passenger seat of the black Mercedes that would hurtle herheadlong into death.Their black Mercedes S280 raced toward the Pont de l’Alma tunnel at top speed.Despite the decoy attempt, paparazzi were still in pursuit, hoping to get apicture every tabloid editor in the world had wanted: Princess Diana and her newboyfriend, Dodi.Behind the wheel of the luxury car with silver trim was drunk (or drugged)chauffeur Henri Paul, in no condition to handle the hulking 4,900-pound luxuryvehicle.Perhaps blinded by love for each other, Diana and her lover Dodi, beside her inthe back of the Mercedes S280 with silver trim, had no idea he was incapacitatedbeyond belief. The autopsy of the forty-one-year-old former French air captainshowed he had a blood alcohol level of 0.19 percent, three times the legal limitin France. Medics warn such a high level can cause staggering and doublevision—rendering it almost suicidal to get in a car and drive. A September 1997analysis of Paul’s hair and spinal cord also detected the antidepressant Prozacas well as Tiapridal, which is used to combat alcohol withdrawal. The driveralso had a chip on his shoulder, as he’d been off-duty that night, downingScotch and beer at home. It’s feared he had sunk the equivalent ofone-and-a-half bottles of wine and was furious he’d been called back to work todrive the world’s most famous couple.Before speeding off with Diana and Dodi, Paul snarled at the pap pack Dianaspent her life shielding her eyes from, “You won’t catch us!”A photographer at the scene told our investigation that Paul’s actions remindedhim of an alcoholic he knew well—his father.With bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones (who would miraculously survive the crash withserious injuries yet remember nothing) in the front passenger seat, infuriatedPaul shoved the $123,000 car in gear and veered away from the back entrance ofthe Ritz hotel Diana had used to try and evade snappers. But speeding along theexpressway along the Seine River, it was obvious the ruse was useless. Thepaparazzi at first followed a decoy car, but quickly realized they had beenduped and quickly zeroed in on their prey.Paul drove along the Rue Cambon to the junction with the Rue de Rivoli, thenturned right, heading into the Place de la Concorde. After being held at trafficlights there, he continued toward the embankment road of the River Seine,avoiding the more direct route of the Avenue des Champs-Élysées. He then drovealong the embankment road, Cours la Reine, and Cours Albert, passing under theAlexandre III tunnel.It was considered by chauffeurs in Paris as the “professional driver’s route” asit allows them to avoid the heavy traffic of the Avenue des Champs-Élysées onSaturday nights. But, according to those same drivers, the obvious route afterthe Alexandre III tunnel is an exit slip road to the right, leading to theavenue George V or the avenue Marceau.Paul didn’t take the slip road, but continued toward the four-lane, two-way Pontde l’Alma underpass with several pap vehicles having closed in on the Merc.Despite the underpass having a lip at its east entrance, Paul rocketed to 121mph as the car hit the opening of the tunnel next to the River Seine, under thePont de l’Alma Bridge.His speed as he hit the tunnel’s opening lip would have sent the vehicle soaringinto the air.It was probably while airborne that drunk Paul disastrously tried to correct hissteering while simultaneously trying to negotiate a looming curve in the road.His driving was a mess he couldn’t fix. The car clipped the tight wall of the660-foot underpass close to the lip of the tunnel. Paul lost control of themassive Mercedes. It was slung diagonally across the road, before careering intothe solid concrete thirteenth pillar that supports the canter of the underpass.The car rolled over a full 360 degrees, then spun 180 degrees before it slammedinto a wall on the opposite side of the road.Coming to rest on all four wheels—facing the direction from which it had enteredthe tunnel—the car had been mashed like a squeezed accordion.Passersby heard an explosion and what one couple described as a “big bang.” Thenthere was quiet—except for the car horn blaring. Paul’s body had depressed itwhen it slumped lifeless onto the steering wheel.The only other noise at this point was smoke hissing from the battered hulk ofthe Mercedes.Then came Diana’s moans.Diana—who had not worn her seat belt—was suffering catastrophic internalbleeding. Her battered body was also battling to cope with the extreme shock ofthe collision.She had brutally rotated during the crash, and her rare injuries suggested herheart had been thrown violently forward inside her chest when the car crashed.Paul, forty-one, and Dodi, forty-two, had been killed instantly.Diana’s six-foot-two bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones—now fifty years old—shatteredall fourteen bones in his face and sustained serious injuries to the torso.Doctors would later insert more than thirty metal plates and screws into hisface, which was so mangled they had to use family photographs for referenceduring surgeries. But Rees-Jones’s life was saved by the same simple decisionmany crash experts believe would have meant Diana would be alive today—wearing aseat belt.There was hardly any sound for the first two minutes after the crash except forthe horn. The noise emanated weakly from both ends of the tunnel—from the eastend, which the black Mercedes had sped into moments before it crashed, and fromthe west end, where the narrow tunnel opened onto a spectacular view of the leftbank of the Seine.On the packed streets above—where the lights of the Eiffel Tower had yet to beshut off for the night—the muffled sound of one car horn might not even benoticed.But seconds before the crash, American tourists Tom Richardson and Joanna Luzfrom San Diego heard the accident. When they ran into the tunnel, they saw thecar facing back in the direction from which it had come, its roof crushed, itswindshield smashed, and its airbags deployed.In front of the wreck, a paparazzo—the last Diana pap—raised his camera andbegan to snap.French firefighter Xavier Gourmelon, fifty-one, was one of the first emergencyworkers to see the blood-soaked innards of Diana’s death car—the front airbagsthat blasted out when Paul hit the pillar soaked in viscera.He said Diana was curiously free of blood and clinging onto consciousness andhad her eyes open as he carefully pulled her from the smoking wreckage.Xavier gave her CPR but she suffered a cardiac arrest as she was gently placedon a stretcher. Another firefighter said he heard her mutter “Dodi, Dodi” overand over again before her battered body convulsed during her heart attack.Xavier said:My ten-man team was in two trucks and we were first to arrive. The car was in amess and we just dealt with it like any road accident. I could see the driverwas already dead and there was nothing that could be done for him. Mr. Al-Fayedwas in the back and in a bad condition. He had a cardiac arrest in the car andwhen he was taken out he was declared dead by a paramedic. The bodyguard in thefront was conscious, but he was trapped and had very severe facial injuries. Thewoman, who I later found out was Princess Diana, was on the floor in the back.She was moving very slightly, and I could see she was alive. I held her hand andtold her to be calm and keep still. I said I was there to help and reassuredher. She said, “My God, what’s happened?” I massaged her heart and a few secondslater she started breathing again. As far as I knew when she was in theambulance, she was alive, and I expected her to live. But I found out later shehad died in hospital. It was very upsetting. I know now that there were seriousinternal injuries, but the whole episode is still very much on my mind. And thememory of that night will stay with me forever.Sadly, Diana died as she had lived much of her life—in agony.The princess who had survived the torment of bulimia, self-harm, drug and pilladdictions, and a string of broken relationships, was in a huge amount of painfrom 12:23 a.m. to 4 a.m. on August 31, 1997, when surgeons finally gave uptrying to massage her heart back into action and declared her dead.A review of Diana’s official forty-page autopsy report reveals she sustained“blunt chest and probably head trauma” when the Mercedes carrying her hurtledinto that solid concrete pillar.Astonishingly, the first witnesses and emergency workers on the scene found hersitting on the floor of the car, her eyes open while she mumbled indecipherablephrases.Yet soon after that, she would close her eyes forevermore."},{"pageContent":"--------------------------------------------------------------------------------For those close to the princess, that night remains seared in their memories.The princess had been on the cusp of finally finding great happiness—or so itseemed—and now, in one horrible instant, all of that was ripped away from her.As millions around the world turned on their televisions in horror anddisbelief, they began asking questions—many of which have still not beenanswered to any great satisfaction. Exactly what happened? Why did the carcrash? Who were the people involved?And the central question on everyone’s mind: Was it an accident…or was itsomething more sinister?From the very outset, the French police made astonishing errors andmisjudgments, but perhaps no action on their part was more egregious thanfailing to treat the accident like the crime scene it was. The entire areaaround the tunnel was busy. People came and went on foot. There was greatdisorganization. No real security was implemented to keep pedestrians fromapproaching. And nobody seemed to know who was in charge.After the injured and dead were removed from the Mercedes, a tow truck wasreversed into the tunnel with a crane. The Mercedes had not even had time to beadequately photographed by police for clues or evidence. Nonetheless, the carwas loaded up and hauled away.After that, a different government vehicle arrived and began hosing down thestreet. The entire street was washed clean.Next, four government workers in bright green and yellow cleaning gear arrivedto begin sweeping up the debris.It looked for all the world as though the French government’s primary priorityhad become ensuring that all evidence of the event that had just occurred wasremoved as quickly as possible so that morning traffic would not be encumbered.Almost immediately, important facts began to get out. The driver of the car hadbeen drinking. There had been flashes inside the tunnel. The Mercedes hadconnected with another car.Yet—unfortunately and unbelievably—it now seemed that definitive answers wouldnot be easy to come by because the French authorities had been so quick to cleanup the accident scene.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Diana’s final hours can hardly be understood without delving into the world ofthe man at the wheel of the car that ended her life.We know the numbers, the tale of the tape. The autopsy and toxicology report onHenri Paul showed that he was blind drunk at the time of the accident. He was atthrice the legal limit for drunk driving. His blood also contained a cocktail ofdrugs. He was said to be a habitual drunk.In the minds of many casual observers of the accident, this had been thebeginning and the end of the story. A drunken driver is startled byphotographers and crashes in a tunnel.But there is more to the story.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------On paper, at least, Henri Paul was a model employee. He was employed by theAl-Fayed family and had been for over ten years. In addition to being a driver,he was also a pilot, having received his pilot’s license in 1976.This pilot’s license is very important.All French pilots are required to have an annual pilot’s physical in order toretain their license. This annual examination tests for—among otherthings—evidence of alcohol problems. It includes bloodwork, and a test of liverfunction.Henri Paul’s most recent pilot’s physical happened just three days before theaccident. He passed with flying colors. Paul’s parents have also insisted thatit was not normal for him to drink to excess.After the accident, associates of Paul testified to French police that Paul didnot have any special tolerance for alcohol. They said that he did not normallydrink to excess. They also said that when he did drink to excess, it wasobvious. In short, he lacked any of the symptoms of a classic alcoholic.Paul’s personal physician told French police that Paul was not alcoholic, butthat she was worried he might become so out of despondency over a recentromantic breakup. Accordingly, she was prescribing him Prozac for hisdepression, and an anti-alcoholism medication called Aotal. In the autopsy, afurther prescription drug called Zentel—used to treat worms—was also found inPaul’s system. His physician could not explain how it got there and deniedprescribing it.On the night he died, security cameras captured Paul waving casually tophotographers as they waited to snap photos of Diana and Dodi. It is not knownif this was merely a friendly wave, or if it was a sign of intoxication.Witnesses that night have made varying, inconsistent claims about the amountthat they saw Paul drink. One account—which was affirmed by his bar bill thatnight—shows him consuming only two alcoholic drinks before driving. However,other witnesses and expert analysis investigating the case have put the realnumber closer to ten drinks. They have also cited witnesses who have affirmedthat Paul did appear to be visibly intoxicated when he climbed into the car todrive Diana.Yet there were other questions about Paul that made our investigative teamunderstand that we needed to take a second and third look.Henri Paul was a forty-one-year-old professional driver. Yet, when he died, itwas revealed that he had the equivalent of approximately $340,000 in multiplebank accounts. How? How did this happen, and who was paying him?Drivers, even drivers of the very wealthy, do not normally amass this kind ofmoney. Many alleged that Paul had earned this money by working covertly forsecurity services. By spying. But for what or whom, it remains to be seen.Yet there were those who defended Paul’s wealth, and insisted he’d come by itlegitimately. Paul’s coworkers attested that sometimes Paul received four-figuretips from the cadre of international royalty he drove. Further, there wasevidence that Paul had apparently used his money to begin buying rentalproperties, and that income from collecting rents could be a source of the moneythat authorities found squirreled away.Yet for too many, the story simply does not add up.Henri Paul was responsible for the safe travel of the most photographed, mostfamous woman in the world. Yet his blood was a mess of alcohol, Prozac, andanti-alcohol pharmaceuticals. The romantic breakup that had necessitated theProzac also suggests that his mental state may have been impaired in other ways.In short, a cocktail of depression and booze added up to Diana’s driver being awholly unfit man who seems to have taken no reasonable security measures tosafeguard Diana. His behavior, his drug taking, his boozing, and hisirresponsibility is the perfect example for what a security officer should notdo when undertaking close personal protection of a dignitary.But Paul’s selfish and reckless actions also seem to have been influenced by hisattraction to the celebrity of the whole sordid affair. Paul was a man whowanted to attach himself to the glamour and excitement that surrounded PrincessDiana. For you see, he was not only intoxicated by alcohol and drugs, but by thechance to pal around with the very person he should have been shielding, notfascinated with.How did Paul come to be driving Diana that night? Is drunken driving the chiefculprit in explaining Diana’s accident, or is something more sinister at play?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------DETECTIVE’S NOTEBOOKDATELINE: One week into the crime-scene investigation, September 1997What will history make of Henri Paul? Will he be remembered forever as the manwho killed the queen of hearts? Will his name become as infamous as that of LeeHarvey Oswald or John Hinckley Jr. and be assured of its place as the answer toa future Trivial Pursuit question? Or will he be forgotten, his name simply fadeaway like the rubber tire residue at the Pont de l’Alma tunnel entrance?In time, I turned my attentions to Paul, the ill-fated driver of the doomedMercedes-Benz. In among the mountain of media clippings that I had amassed,there was a decent-sized pile pertaining to the Mercedes driver’s supposedintoxication that night. The media was adamant that Henri Paul was as pie-eyedas the proverbial parrot, and all that I had picked up to date seemed to suggestthe same. Of course, there was the predictable media release from the Fayedconglomerate’s Ritz-Carlton Hotel, stating adamantly that their chauffeur wasnot intoxicated. Released in early September, it read, “Henri Paul did not haveany appearance of being over excited or being drunk as a pig.” Odd words, Ithought as I read the comment. Then as if the organization was desperate to makeits point, their security manager added, “He was sober, he didn’t smell ofalcohol, his gait was steady, and they had no suggestion or indication that hewas anything other than completely sober.” What’s more, a senior executiveaffirmed that Henri Paul “was an exemplary employee.”It was now the wrong side of September and there were media leaks and localgossip apropos Henri’s drinking habits surfacing daily. Newspaper reports quotedinflated blood alcohol readings and the man’s reputation was sliding rapidlydown the slippery slope. The initial blood alcohol test administered as arequirement of the autopsy procedure after Henri’s death produced a reading of0.175%. This had been followed by a second comparison test that indicated0.187%. Either way, blood alcohol evidence had Henri Paul thoroughly smashed. Bythe law of vicarious liability, culpability for any misfortune that may occurwhile he was on duty in this condition would unquestionably land on hisshoulders, and (normally) on the shoulders of his employer. I was beginning tosense a more self-serving motive behind the Ritz-Carlton’s championing of theirhapless employee.To offer the benefit of the doubt to all concerned, I felt it my duty to soak upa few whiskey sours in the Ritz. It was time for me to talk with Henri’s friendsand workmates and ascertain as much as possible about the sobriety of the driverwho not only killed himself but also the hottest targets of the paparazzi. Idonned my best outfit and uncharacteristically I caught a taxi, gesturing forhim to let me out just shy of the four vanilla-colored canopies that signaledthe entrance. Nodding to the doorman on duty, I pushed on the imposing revolvingdoors and stepped back one hundred years into the vision of its creator, CésarRitz. I was almost bowled over by the hotel’s magnificence, wondering at how thewealthy spent their time. Keeping on the move, knowing the moment I lookedbefuddled I would more than likely be called out, I cursed not having packed aZegna double-breasted cashmere suit, a pair of Berluti Russian calfskin brogues,and a splash of Paul Smith “London” aftershave. Then I could have faced thegrand old pub without fear.However, I strolled purposefully over the polished marble and hand-spun rugs andgathered up a newspaper, flinging it under my arm. In keeping with my nouveaupersona I inquired confidently of a bellhop, “Where’s the Hemingway Bar, lad?”He pointed me deeper into the building to a nook decked out in original timberpaneling and old-world charm. My first win, hopefully an omen of things to come!I pulled up a stool and sat with a lonely cocktail waiter. Itching to divorcehis glass-polishing napkin, he was also keen for some small talk as he shook thebest and most expensive whiskey sour of my life. Two drinks later and hedelivered up the mandatory mixed nuts along with the comment that Henri Paul wasa serious drinker who often snuck into the bar to take “a shot or two” while onduty. And yes, Henri Paul had been drinking there on the night of his fatefuldrive.My next stop was the quaint restaurant-cum-cocktail bar known as Bar Vendôme,off the hotel garden. I beelined for the bar under the watchful eye of themaître d’, who was of the belief that I was seeking a table for an early dinnerbut opting for a drink first. I had made a mental note of a story reported byLondon’s Evening Standard that “Henri Paul bumped into people as he left thebar” just hours prior to the tragedy. When the moment was right, I steered myconversation with the bartender in this direction adding that I had heard thatHenri Paul had consumed two shots of pastis (a French aperitif similar instrength to whiskey). He quipped that the story was a “fabrication by the media”as he twirled a sprig of lemon rind on my upcoming third whiskey sour. Then hehanded me a real gem. Henri, he confided, was a regular drinker at his swankyestablishment, mostly after dinner, after hours. I declined his offer to put mydrink on my room tab, paid cash instead, and wandered out, knowing that I hadwon that battle nicely.It was now shortly after 9 p.m. I headed for the guest foyer, where, surroundedby Louis XV antiques, I lost myself in my newspaper. I needed to kill some timeuntil the night staff clocked on. With the way my luck was playing out, I wasgrowing confident of my chances of snaring a chat with one of the floor securityhounds. The sophisticates were beginning to arrive, and I toyed with a littlemental game of “how much did that outfit cost you, buddy?” I didn’t come up withanything in my cop’s price bracket.As the lights were dimmed for the parading of the serious fashionistas, I snuckout a side door and bent the ear of one of the hotel’s bouncers. We stood on RueCambon chatting about this and that. His chest almost puffed out withself-importance that one of the guests was interested in his routine and, in notime, he lost himself to a spate of gossip, about a dead man he had once workedwith. Of the opinion that Henri Paul was a bit of a heavy drinker, he was quickto add that he liked him. I was able to squeeze in three significant questions:Was Henri an alcoholic?To which he replied, “Maybe.”Did Henri drink in the bars?His answer, “Yes.”In the Hemingway bar?He stated, “Yes.”By this stage, feeling a little puffed out myself, I elected to hit the nightair and take a brisk walk to recharge my batteries before doing the rounds ofthe eclectic collection of clubs in the precinct. I strolled across the lobbyand trod the plush red carpet once more before saying goodbye to the Ritz,knowing that I was unlikely to ever return.As I ambled along the cobblestone pavements, I processed that which my last fewdrinks had taught me. A clear-cut portrait was forming in my mind of a chauffeurwith an alcohol addiction. I coupled this with the widely reported story thatHenri Paul was a frequent user of the prescription drugs Prozac and Triapdal,and feared the result of the equation, a lethal cocktail. Diana and Dodi wereindeed flirting with death when they stepped into the rear of the Mercedes withHenri Paul behind the wheel. I flicked a look at my notebook and the list I hadnamed “Henri’s drinking holes.” The well-known Harry’s Bar was only a block anda half away, at 5 Rue Daunou. This would be my next stop.As far as single-malt whiskey is concerned, this old-world bar is aninstitution. Offering sixty different types of my preferred beverage, Harry’shas been around as long as the Ritz, and has played host to the drinking set ofParis since day one. I was greeted with the overused cliché proudly informing methat Ernest Hemingway once drank there. I mean how many bars worldwide couldthat man have patronized, really? My inquiry, it seemed, had come down to twodrunks, both frequenting the same watering hole!It had been widely speculated by the world media that Henri Paul had beendrinking in Harry’s Bar on the night of his final shift. I sniffed out themanager before my first drink had found its coaster and went straight for thejugular, posing my nosy questions. He seemed a fairly decent man, despite theusual pomp and ceremony that accompanies owners of such establishments.Verifying beyond doubt that Henri Paul was a regular drinker there, he wasequally adamant that he had not been there on the night of August 31, althoughhe had been seen there the day earlier. I could think of no credible reason tostop for a taste of a second whiskey as tempting as their splendid array was, soI moved on to the Champmesle four blocks away. The walk, I thought, would onceagain do me good.A narrow-fronted little bar, the type that dotted many of the backstreets ofParis, the Champmesle was the closest geographically to where Henri Paul lived,in his nondescript tiny apartment above a shop. It was so small that a mere tenpatrons was all that would be necessary to send the barmen into a flap. He wasin a flap on the night of my visit. The joint was jumping, and the sounds ofcool jazz saturated the night air. I squeezed a tiny section of space at thecounter, ordered a longneck beer, and waited for the right time to mention HenriPaul. An unsettling bout of unwanted eye-to-eye contact from a male patron hadme realize that the hole-in-the-wall bar was the second home to the neighborhoodgays. I shuffled off to stand at the door. A well-groomed couple struck up achat so as not to see me waste my beer, so I took the risk of mentioning thename of one of their locals, Henri. Our subsequent conversation cost me an extrathree beers; however, by its end, I had proof positive that Henri Paul hadconsumed a “couple of drinks” there only hours before the crash. The patronsintroduced me to the manager, who recalled Henri Paul to be a lonely anddepressed man, one of the many, he said, that frequented his bar. He alsoremembered Henri Paul was on a break from work, having a quiet drink on his wayhome. The drink was interrupted as he was recalled to duty, and offered, whatwas sadly remembered as his final farewell.As I slunk back to my soft hotel bed, I speculated how I would have coped if nowcalled upon to chauffeur Diana at high speed through the streets of Paris lateat night while being pursued by a horde of paparazzi. While the thoughtinitially put a smile on my face, I still worked through the essence of thequestion. I had certainly had way too many whiskey sours to take the risk ofdriving, but as I had just discovered, prior to the commencement of Henri’s lastjourney, he had not only met me drink for drink but had also been on duty forthe previous sixteen hours with virtually no structured break or downtime of anyconsequence.I carried this thought with me as I turned out the bedside lamp and rolled overto attempt some much-needed shuteye. Trouble was, there was another thoughtthere also, one that kept pushing its way to the forefront of my consciousness.It was more a snippet of information really, but one that I had heard repeated afew times over during the past evening. Perhaps just workplace gossip, on facevalue I knew it required investigation. I promised it my keenest attention thefollowing day, pushed it back to the far corner of my mind and closed my eyes.Knowing there was little I could accomplish along this path in the morninghours, I enjoyed a lengthy lie-in. Showered and shaved, I wandered down to alate breakfast and enjoyed the company of the staff, who were becoming mates bynow. I was careful not to divulge what I was really up to, although I had longago come to know that chambermaids rarely miss a lot. They are a lot sharperthan most guests give them credit for; I had learned that much when I was anactive detective in Australia.After idle attempts at chat, I went back to the task that had bothered me thenight before. I pondered the best path of discovery. The Benoit restaurant wasmy quarry—mid-afternoon, between services, my ideal hour of attack.The story I was following was one that had floated for the duration of theprevious evening. A few of the Ritz boys were of the belief that Dodi hadpurchased an engagement ring. The Benoit was allegedly his chosen location forproposing marriage to Diana on the night of their deaths. When I analyzed thesnippets that I had heard, I rationalized that there were just as many commentsfrom Henri’s colleagues that had not heard the rumor as there were those thathad, but I needed to find out for myself.A cab fare from the Ritz, off swanky Rue de Rivoli at 20 Rue St. Martin, Ilocated this gorgeous Michelin star establishment, the home of one of theworld’s great chefs: Alain Ducasse. With its crispy white tablecloths, finemonogrammed china, and ornate timber paneled partitions between tables, I couldinstantly accept it as a very romantic location for a proposal. The restaurantwas almost empty of lunchtime diners, as I had hoped. The last of thefirst-class travel set leaving as I entered, black Amex cards being restacked infat wallets. I decided to take the direct approach and confront the maître d’,armed with my best Australian smile. Initially offering a warm handshake inreturn, the big man’s gaze froze over when I explained the purpose for mypresence in his dining room. He had adopted his best French maître d’ manner:cool, raised eyebrows, and with the accompanying short step backwards. I thinkmy winning line was that I was a police detective in my homeland. He seemed torationalize that I was a safer bet than a newspaper reporter. I asked thequestion I had brought with me:“Were Dianna and Dodi booked into the restaurant on the night of August 30?”He needed no time to think and replied naturally, and to the affirmative, addingthat with such a booking there was no necessity to check his register. Heoffered that it was his belief that the couple had planned to get engaged thatevening, although he could not recall exactly why he held such a belief. Hereflected on his last comment for a moment or two before continuing, explainingthat Dodi had spoken to him personally about the booking. He walked me over tothe table that Dodi had requested, a quiet setting in a corner, away from thewindows of the luxurious restaurant alongside the salon privé. He added that thecouple had never arrived for their table and the booking was canceled, forreasons unknown to the maître d’…a love story that ended not long after it hadbegun: a starry-eyed tragedy that would fascinate forever. We both stared at theempty table for rather too long and then the somewhat stuffy, yet thoroughlydecent man offered me a complimentary glass of mineral water and I was away.On my way back to my hotel room I stopped at a coffeehouse and sat for a spellreminiscing on my time in Paris, allowing the discoveries and disappointments towash over me. I sat on my coffee until I was forced to order a fresh one as thefirst cup had soured, as also by then had my mood. My thoughts were lost to asilly man, Henri Paul, and the heartache that he had caused the two sons ofPrincess Diana, her family, and all the friends and people that cared so deeplyfor the sometimes troubled, yet magnificently resilient, woman. I found theentire saga almost surreal, as if it had been invented, but I knew to thecontrary. It was horribly real. I found a token of solace in the progress of myinvestigation to date. There was no smoking gun, no terrorism and no espionage,just a drunken driver and a ring that never found a finger.Ultimately, while Henri Paul may well have fussed over his chauffeuring dutiesfor the princess and her companion, remaining on call, responding to theirlate-night jaunt, he did a dismal job of evading the paparazzi. In fact, thefaçade he presented of dodging the photographic pests was just that—a façade. Aclose study of CCTV footage of the area showed Henri Paul frequentlyfraternizing with the paparazzi in the hours that lead up to the hurrieddeparture from the Ritz. In fact, the familiarity with which they joustedstrongly suggested that he was keeping them abreast of any planned movements.The final footage of Henri Paul outside the hotel clearly shows him signaling toa well-known photographer, just prior to Princess Diana exiting via a rear door.So, a lonely alcoholic security buffoon, an inconsequential Ritz employee,became lost in a miserable moment of self-importance planning to lead thewaiting paparazzi on a merry chase. One that ultimately ensured his name wouldnever be forgotten. And as far as Dodi was concerned, he must surely have beencognizant of the drunken state of his chosen driver. Such quantity of alcoholconsumption would not only manifest itself in the chauffeur’s swagger, but hisbreath would have reeked. Under no circumstances should Dodi have allowed HenriPaul to take possession of the car keys that night. Yet, like a lovestruckRomeo, Dodi appeared to have been blind to the potential disaster that wouldface his love and companions.Nor should the man more specifically charged with the security of Diana, TrevorRees-Jones, be absolved from blame. As the only person to survive the horrificsmash, he must surely live daily with regrets of his inaction.As a footnote, in an extraordinary gesture of goodwill, the priest at Henri’sburial service recounted to the congregation a letter from the mother of theprincess of Wales. It read, “We have neither anger nor reproach. We suffer forHenri’s family. Of all the families concerned their suffering must be theworst.”The burial of the drunken monkey was overseen by approximately one hundredpaparazzi and press photographers, keen to document the latest episode in thesaga, before speeding off to deposit their proofs and cash their paychecks.CHAPTER SEVENWhen Colin McLaren took it upon himself to journey to the site of Diana’s deathto look for answers back in 1997, he had only the most general sense of thesecrets being concealed.In his own words, Colin has explained how the mystery began to revealitself—though the answers he sought were still light years away. He wasn’t theonly one. A confused and grieving public began to pine for answers about whathad contributed to the poor princess’s death, and conspiracy theories began toemerge.Meanwhile, those closest to Diana were also aware that she genuinely feared forher life. The conspiracies were given even more credence when butler PaulBurrell came forward with a shocking message from beyond the grave.To quote Paul Burrell:The princess had been persecuted, undermined, misrepresented, misinterpreted allher life, and she was frightened during the last few years of her life. Shethought she was being followed. She thought all her phone calls were beingtapped. She sat at her desk often late at night and wrote me notes. This lettergoes on for ten pages, and part of it reads, “This is the most difficult part ofmy life. I fear that Charles is going to organize an accident in my car. I amgoing to die of head injuries and be killed in order that he can marry Camilla.”I read the princess’s hand on her own stationery saying that, she prophesizedher own death. She prophesized how she would die. She wasn’t paranoid. She wasan intelligent, young woman who was informed. So, what does that mean? Does thatmean she was mad, or does it mean that she knew she was going to die? I don’tknow. I just think it’s rather odd that she was here one minute and gone thenext.Paul Burrell’s revelations prompted Diana’s divorce lawyer, Lord Mishcon, toalso come forward.In October 1996, the princess had shared her deadly serious beliefs with herlawyers, Lord Mishcon, Maggie Rae, and Sandra Davies. They urged her to put herconcerns in writing. She wrote:This particular phase in my life is the most dangerous. My husband is planning“an accident” in my car, brake failure and serious head injury in order to makethe path clear for him to marry.The document was taken directly to Scotland Yard, where it would stay under lockand key.Author and magazine editor Ingrid Seward also had a gut response that it mighthave been more than an accident. As she explains:When she died in the crash…I thought it might be somebody trying to get atMohamed Al-Fayed because he had a lot of very powerful enemies, rather thanDiana. I never thought that someone would try and kill Diana.I just thought in order to get to the father, you get to the son. It was a very,very, very high-profile romance, so if someone wanted to get to Al-Fayed, theycould’ve tried to kill his son in what looked like an accident…. That was thething that flashed into my mind.Many observers shared Seward’s suspicions. Some believed that the powers incontrol of Diana’s life were not ready to accept that Diana might end up marriedto an Egyptian—particularly, to an Egyptian with a father whom they found verydistasteful.Others held that the final straw sealing Diana’s fate was likely the “babybump”—whether real or imagined—that had been observed and captured byphotographers working in the south of France. Marrying Dodi would be one thing,but having a child conceived out of wedlock would be another.Rumors ran rampant as the public imagined forces conspiring to “take care of”this situation.Yet, slowly—and perhaps despite the best efforts of the powerful—information didbegin to bubble to the surface concerning what had happened to Diana’s car onthe night in question.French police discovered white paint on Diana’s black Mercedes, indicating asecond vehicle had collided with it. The paint was unique to the Fiat Uno, oneof the most popular cars in Europe at the time. The search involved thousands ofcars.When Colin McLaren arrived in Paris, it was into this strange mix of confusion,cover-up, and government incompetence that he waded.Nonetheless, he was determined to do all that he could to find the truth.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------DETECTIVE’S NOTEBOOKDATELINE: Mid-September 1997Now aware that Henri Paul was the architect of the death ride into the tunnel, Iattempted to parse the many descriptions of what sort of car he was driving.Some reports called it an armored car, some said a high-end 600 series limousinewith bulletproof windows, on it went. I eventually came to the conclusion thatPaul drove a Mercedes that fateful night, and that it had more of a history thanmost press accounts let on. The vehicle had been the subject of an earliercarjacking, about a month before the crash. I wanted to know if this could havefactored into Diana’s death.I got lucky and found out where the real death car was located and headed to theoutskirts of Paris. In receipt of my latest invaluable gem of information andaided by an efficient rail system, I traveled the 10 miles north to 38 Rue duDoctor Bauer, Saint Ouen, and the dealership that had carried out the mechanicalrepairs and services on the vehicle. Luckily for me, English is widely spokeneven in the outskirts of Paris.Half an hour after arriving, I was at lunch with the dealership’s servicemanager. With a basic worker’s meal ordered and a glass of Beaujolais in hand,he confirmed what I already knew about the Mercedes. It was a standard ClassS280 sedan, black in color, with a 2.8-liter, six-cylinder engine. Fitted withseat belts to the front and rear passenger seats, and airbags to the frontpassenger and driver seats, it was a current model and less than one year old.Selling in France for 347,500 francs ($59,237), it was the least expensive ofthe range. Then a silence fell. We sipped our wine. Despite the familiarity wehad established during our opening repartee regarding the local rugby scene,there was the beginning of a hesitation in his voice. I guessed that he wasstarting to wonder who I really was. I went on to explain that I had traveledfrom Australia, not to sensationalize the accident, just to reach a betterunderstanding of the tragedy. And perhaps if I were to find answers, Icontinued, they may offer some comfort to those, who like me, held the PrincessDiana in high esteem. I also explained that my fascination with the Diana casewas stirred, mostly because I was on vacation in Paris and had the opportunityto find answers for myself. He started to relax again. I held back the manyquestions I had hoped to put to him for a moment, opting to finish my meal.I reopened our dialogue. Was there a lot of street crime in Paris then? And soit went. Pretty soon, his reticence had lifted, he spoke freely of the recentcarjacking, adding that not only was the radio and cassette stolen from thecenter console of the ill-fated Mercedes-Benz, but all the wheels and tires werealso missing. This led to that and pretty soon he explained that as a result ofthe accident at pillar thirteen, the engine had been forced into the vehicle’scabin. He considered the Mercedes must have been traveling at up to 200kilometers per hour—or 124 mph. And only days earlier the French police had beenin touch with him regarding foreign paint found on the front left-hand side ofthe car. There was a collective opinion that the paint was from a white Fiat Unosedan. Aha, the second car, I thought. Things were starting to firm up.Apart from the knowledge of the paint markings, he was unable or perhapsunwilling to offer any further information. I paid the check, and we returned tothe dealership. With apologies, he then went back to the paying customers,leaving me with the mechanic who had worked on the vehicle to tidy up any looseends. Bingo. Just the man I wanted to see.A strapping fellow with the requisite overalls, he gesticulated his way througha proud declaration that the Mercedes was unreservedly roadworthy after thecarjacking repairs had been completed. Recalling clearly the necessary work, heattested that four new wheels and tires were also fitted, and he made the handmotions that left me in no doubt of his sincerity. Then, as a matter of course,he instructed that the car be taken to the police prefecture office where it waschecked over and issued a certificate of compliance.Only then had it been given the okay to be returned to the Ritz-Carltonlimousine fleet for guest chauffeur work. Knowing that I was standing withinmeters of the vehicle, it was a heartfelt disappointment that I was notpermitted to inspect the wreckage. Its resting place was an outside carcompound, but the police managed the compound, and it was well and truly locked.Putting my personal disappointment to one side, had I been able to view thecarnage it wouldn’t really have changed anything. At the end of the day, the carwas still just a standard S Class Mercedes-Benz. The princess had been travelingin nothing more than a German family sedan. So much for the armored car stories.By late afternoon, I was back on my train traveling toward Montmartre and myhotel room. I was feeling pretty pleased with myself, having once and for allsettled the riddle of the Mercedes-Benz. But I had a twinge of guilt for havingto employ some old covert police skills to solicit information from thethoroughly decent Mercedes-Benz people. As the train whizzed me through thesubway tunnels, I kept drifting off into the next piece of the jigsaw: thesecond car. Was there a second vehicle involved? The short answer had to be yes.The glass fragments I had found at the scene confirmed the presence of anothervehicle. And the scrapes on the retaining wall above the glass were well out ofthe trajectory line of the Mercedes.So where was that car now—and where was its driver? Surely the grief and remorseassociated with this accident would be enough to flush out the most hardened ofpersons? Or was the driver working for someone else—someone or something moresinister?CHAPTER EIGHTWe know the forces that Diana had angered. We know the specific men she chose tospend her time with, and what the implications were. Now—even though it may bedifficult—we must focus on how Diana and Dodi’s behavior impacted the night ofthe crash itself.By reviewing what is established—and what has not yet been established—we workour way toward staggering new revelations.If you believe Mohamed Al-Fayed, tears of happiness misted Diana’s eyes as sheaccepted her lover Dodi’s marriage proposal over a candlelit dinner—an hourbefore the accident that brutally claimed their lives.It’s the final heartbreaking tragedy of Diana’s life, if Mohamed is to bebelieved: she found true happiness after years of tumultuous breakups, includingher toxic split from Prince Charles that had dragged on for years.Confirming Diana and Dodi’s wedding plans, Hassan Yassin, a Paris-based relativeof the former playboy, said at the time, “Dodi told me the night he died that hewas going to marry Diana. I felt Dodi had found himself in her—and she in him.”Dodi also confided to his close pal Michael Cole, who worked for his billionairetycoon father, that he planned to spend the rest of his life with the princess.“I’ll never have another girlfriend,” he vowed.But there are serious questions about whether or not the “engagement” was real.Diana, sources have said, tragically knew Dodi was cheating on her with anotherwoman and could only have accepted his proposal, if indeed she did, to avoidupsetting her lover.Diana died nursing gut-wrenching grief over her discovery Dodi had a secretfiancée she branded “Camilla Mark Two.”For you see, Dodi brazenly spent his nights sleeping with model Kelly Fisher,while seducing Diana during the daylight. Dodi had been seeing Fisher for monthsbefore he met Diana. And Fisher, then thirty, was, in those days, wearing a$237,000 diamond-and-sapphire engagement ring Dodi had bought her—promising her,in 1996, that he would marry her in August 1997.It’s always been thought that Diana had no idea Dodi was cheating with agorgeous Calvin Klein pinup when they started seeing each other, and while theEgyptian heir was smarming his way into the hearts of her two sons.A source said:Diana may have seemed deliriously happy on her final night with Dodi, but it wasall just an act. The whole evening was tinged with inner pain and sadness forDiana as she knew Dodi was a liar and a cheat. It brought back so many memoriesfor Diana of Charles’s cheating with Camilla she was close to tears a lot of thetime with Dodi—frustrated that her hopes he would be “the one” were beingshattered.But another insider, speaking confidentially for this book, added that Diana wasdetermined not to “roll over” and lose Dodi to another woman, as she had donewith Charles and Camilla. It was almost like it did not matter to her, at leaston the surface.They said:Despite constantly claiming she was “thick as a plank,” Diana was actually verysmart, especially when it came to matters of self-publicity and emotion. She wasdetermined to hold on to Dodi and not telling him she knew about his affair wasone of her tactics. Diana was using her experience of Charles’s affair to plot adifferent set of tactics to win Dodi over for good—and playing dumb and actingoverjoyed at everything he did was one of her key moves.On July 14, Dodi’s Harrods tycoon father summoned him from Paris to join him onholiday with Diana in Saint-Tropez on the French Riviera. The Egyptian merchant,who in 1985 had bought the Mecca of London shopping, Harrods, in the hope ofstorming the British establishment, still dreamed about royal connections.His pointless dream drove him to tell Dodi that wooing the princess was anurgent imperative. After Mohamed Al-Fayed’s directive was issued, a baffledFisher was kept out of sight.While Dodi worked on seducing Diana and played with her sons in the sun, themodel was holed up on his father’s B-list boat, the Cujo. She was also on thevessel when Diana and Dodi were first pictured romping aboard the Jonikal—feverishly refurbished in time for Diana’s visit.Dodi visited Fisher at night in secret after days spent charming Diana at hisbillionaire father’s thirty-bedroom villa, Castle St. Therese, in July, and thenon the Jonikal in August.After learning of Dodi’s romance with Diana, Fisher phoned her ex to vent herfury. A twenty-minute recording of the call was played in London in 2007 duringthe inquest into Diana’s death. It captures Fisher screeching:You even flew me down to Saint-Tropez to sit on a boat while you seduced Dianaall day and fd me all night.The model had justification to complain. She had been featured on the frontcovers of Elle and W before meeting Dodi in Paris in July 1996. He convinced herto give up her lucrative work and gave her a $2,600-a-day allowance. Dodi alsobought her a $6.8 million home in Malibu, where she thought they would livetogether, and gave her a $237,000 engagement ring in February 1997.In the call played at Diana’s inquest, Dodi insists they had already split bythe time he was romancing the princess. Fisher rages that they had still beentalking about their wedding.She is also heard to say, “You told me you didn’t even like her. Why do yousuddenly like her?”Dodi responds by dismissing Fisher as “crazy” and “hysterical.”He finally dumped her on August 7, 1997—the day his relationship with Diana hitworldwide headlines. When Fisher realized she was being used, she triedunsuccessfully to sue Dodi for breach of contract over his promise they wouldmarry.And on August 10, Fisher was sickened when she woke to photos of her love rivalromping with Dodi aboard the Jonikal in pictures dubbed “The Kiss,” first usedby the US publication the Globe. It would be a photograph that horrified theBritish establishment.Our insider revealed the sensational pictures were not as spontaneous as theyseemed.“Diana was extremely savvy when it came to the media,” a source said, adding:The photographer who captured her and Dodi in passionate embraces said she hadspotted him in the distance. She seized the opportunity to play up to thecamera—first, to shock the royal family back in Britain and give two fingers toCharles. And, secondly, to kill Dodi and Kelly’s love. She had been told by hermany moles in the press that Dodi had been spotted sneaking in and out of theboat where Kelly was staying. She then asked her closest confidants toinvestigate and found out Dodi was engaged to the model. It never came out atthe time that Dodi was engaged as Diana did a deal with her moles to give themfuture stories if they would keep their investigations into Dodi and Kelly’srelationship private and between them. She soon got word back that not only wasDodi cheating with Kelly—they were engaged. But once Diana got over herdevastation that her latest lover was a cheat, she hatched a plan to put an endto their relationship without ever confronting Dodi. Getting photographed forimages she knew would make global headlines with Dodi was a masterstroke byDiana, as it achieved all her aims—shocking Prince Charles and the royals, whileleaving Kelly so furious she no longer wanted to marry Dodi.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Diana’s quiet revenge on Fisher was a product of the way she had dealt withPrince Charles’s callous infidelity.The soft-cheeked English rose was tormented from the beginning of herrelationship with Charles by the knowledge he was in love with Parker Bowles—anupper middle-class housewife from Wiltshire far lower on the aristocratic rungsthan Diana.Instead of staying quiet and manipulating Charles into loving her—as she didwith Dodi—Diana cried in public and had a series of bitter confrontations withthe prince over his cheating.Less than a week before her wedding to Charles on July 29, 1981, Diana wasphotographed weeping while watching her fiancé play polo—against a team thatincluded one of her aforementioned and future lovers, James Hewitt.Her tears came after she discovered Charles and Camilla had been sending eachother gifts ahead of her wedding day. She confronted Charles after her publicdisplay of devastation, pleading with him to tell her if he loved Parker Bowles.When Charles refused to give her a direct answer, she started to babble to royalcourtiers about her relationship woes, asking them, “Does Charles love me?”In a ham-fisted attempt to try and resolve the situation, Diana’s flunkiesarranged for her to have lunch with Parker Bowles—unbelievably, at a Londonrestaurant called “Ménage à Trois.”They felt the name of the restaurant was a clear signal to Diana that Charlesintended to keep a mistress for the duration of their marriage—an unwrittentradition within blue bloods that would never sit right with Diana.When she discovered Charles was wearing a pair of silver cufflinks on theirhoneymoon given to him by Parker Bowles, Diana said she “cried and cried.”A source told our investigation, “The experience of being so open with Charlesabout her feelings over his affair with Camilla made her change tack when shefound out Dodi was cheating. She decided to launch a quiet war against Kelly—andwon. Diana felt her survival depended on winning Dodi for herself.”The main reason Diana felt she needed her relationship with Dodi to work is shesaw him as a modern prince with the means to provide the security she needed.But, on the following pages, many of her closest friends describe their finalconversations with Diana and insisting she didn’t love Dodi and never intendedto marry him, only accepting his gifts out of embarrassment.Before she got together with Dodi, her humble heart surgeon lover Hasnat Khanhad run for the hills—petrified at being drawn into Diana’s world of globalcelebrity. Diana realized she needed a man who could match her wealth and fameand provide her with security at the same time.Dodi checked off all those boxes.His father’s wealth gave him the resources to keep the world’s most famous womanfrom getting bored while providing her with up to eight security goons on theirnights out.His yacht, his cliffside compound in the South of France, his Ritz hotel inParis were Diana’s new castles. Diana once confided in her friend Rosa Monckton,“He has all the toys.”The sense of security Diana thought Dodi could offer her allowed her to glossover the truth: he was a tacky Egyptian lounge lizard with the same sense of“style” as Al Pacino’s Scarface.But Diana had reached the point in her life where she finally realized arelationship with someone such as Khan was an impossibility. She could never gofrom global fame to living an “ordinary” existence, and, eventually, adomesticated existence with a man devoted to being a surgeon would have boredher to death. A man like Khan could also never protect her from the motorbikesof the paparazzi.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------According to the Fayed camp, Dodi proposed before getting into the car where hewould die instantly in the crash that left Diana with catastrophic internalinjuries.It was 11 p.m. when Dodi allegedly asked Diana to be his wife, as they sat underthe stars at a secluded garden table at L’Espadon. The spot was one of Paris’smost exclusive restaurants and a feature of the five-star Ritz Hotel in the cityof love.Diana and Dodi had just dined on a feast that included scrambled eggs with wildmushrooms and asparagus, sole tempura, baked turbot, fresh white summertruffles, and wild Scottish salmon. Their meal was washed down with a $425bottle of 1998 Taittinger champagne and mineral water. Red roses and whitecarnations decorated the table and a harpist strummed songs of love in thebackground.Even ultrarich Dodi had trouble picking a ring for the world’s most famouswoman, who was used to access to the crown jewels of England.He decided to tell Diana he wanted her to select her engagement ringherself—after he spent hours at the Repossi jewelry store, across the streetfrom the Ritz, where he picked up two rings he’d previously ordered in MonteCarlo.His father Mohamed Al-Fayed is supposedly now in possession of the ringpurchased from Repossi jewelers—a gold band with diamonds forming the shape ofstar from the firm’s range known as “Dis-moi Oui” (“Tell me Yes”).But Dodi also left the Repossi store clutching a brochure—deciding the mostromantic thing to do was let Diana pick her own band.The witness went on:When they finally left the restaurant, they were holding hands and looked likethey were walking on air.As Diana said goodbye, she turned to a member of the hotel staff and told him,“Thank you for a wonderful night.”Then she glanced at Dodi and added softly, “I’ll never forget it. This was sucha beautiful night because of you.” Those were her last words before getting intothe car that would take her and Dodi on the last ride of their lives.On the fateful day of their deaths, the lovebirds had arrived in Paris at 4:30p.m. on Dodi’s dad’s private jet, after cruising the Mediterranean on theJonikal.It was the couple’s fourth romantic cruise in just seven weeks. In a tragicirony, Diana had originally intended to fly back to Britain immediately afterthe idyllic week of sailing the Med with Dodi.But the seemingly besotted princess didn’t want to break the magic spell of herhappiest vacation ever, and the couple decided to spend one last night in thecity of lights before she flew home to Britain to be with her beloved boys.She planned to spend a week with sons William and Harry before they returned toschool for autumn—and was going to tell them of her momentous decision to marryDodi, said a source.When Diana and Dodi arrived in Paris they went straight to the $10,000-a-nightImperial Suite set aside for them at the Ritz Hotel.After their seven-week whirlwind romance, Diana was confident Dodi was going topropose that night because of hints he’d dropped, including during the lasttelephone call she ever made to excitedly tell a friend how she was lookingforward to beginning a bright new chapter in her life.Diana put in the surprise call from the Ritz to the London home of Richard Kay,a famed royal journalist who had been her confidant throughout the stormiestpatches of her life. In a cryptic conversation she told him she had decided to“radically change” her life by completing all her public charity and good-causeobligations by November. Then, she confided, she would completely withdraw fromher formerly public life.Kay disclosed to our investigation that:She talked about wanting to come home. She asked me a bit about Dodi and whatthe media were reporting. My relationship as a journalist (with and to her), itwas very much about the media and media coverage.But she did talk about her plans for the future. She said she was honestly fedup with working as sort of a semidetached member of the royal family, and shewas going to give all that up.She got the idea to launch a chain of worldwide hospices for dying children andMohamed Al-Fayed, Dodi’s father, was going to help finance it. She told me thatshe was going to do a lot of fund-raising for that. She also said she was goingoff on another land mines expedition to I think Vietnam.She said, “It’s time to get back, get back to work.”One of the last things she said to me that night was, “Get a good night’s sleepand I’ll see you tomorrow.” [The pair had planned to rendezvous on her return toLondon.]He added:I think she was looking for something that she couldn’t find in Charles. I thinkonce you’ve been married to the prince of Wales, it’s very hard to consider whatyou might do next and who might fill the void in your life.What she didn’t want, I know, is to be a trophy wife of a rich man. What shewanted was this companionship and friendship, but also love. She told me shortlybefore she died, the reason she was attracted to Dodi. He understood her world.Dodi had a fairly privileged upbringing and had been in that world of Hollywoodglamor over many years. He had also been a rich man’s son and had had a lot ofprivileges and perks growing up. Lots of money and wealth around him, so heunderstood “society.” Diana said to me that helped her realize he was the guywho could take care of her.Deliriously happy Diana would then, Kay said, be able to live as she’d alwayswanted to live: not as an icon (she hated to be called one) but as a privateperson. It was a “dream sequence,” Kay said he’d heard that from her before, butthis time he knew “she meant it.”It was complete contrast to her relationship with Hasnat Khan, and the fact thathe was another Muslim was obviously very fascinating.There was Khan. Dedicated. Hospital worker. Doctor. Then there was Dodi Fayed.What was he? He was a rich man’s son who put his name to a few films inHollywood and had never had to scrape a living together. He was entirelydifferent. I could see that she would find him and his world very intoxicating.She was very fond of his father, Mohamed.She liked that sort of Middle East warmness that families have. She felt verywelcome in their embrace. She had—by then—changed a lot from the young woman whomarried Charles. She found British families chilly and off-putting and cold.Whereas in Fayed (and in the Khan family, too), she found a deep welcome. Ithink that is what attracted her to him as much as anything.Just before that call, Diana had phoned another close pal in England and gushedto her, “At last I can see the future clearly. I finally know what I want—andwhat I want is Dodi. It’s all happened so fast, but I’ve never been surer ofanything in my life. He’s made me happier than I’ve ever been before.”Yet even in her happiest moments, there is very powerful evidence to suggestDiana felt an undercurrent of sinister doom. Her day of bliss was a fleetingdistraction from it—one hopes—but only a distraction. Diana was a woman marked,and she knew it. She knew it both by the powers of her own observation, and bysupernatural powers as well.Diana’s reliance on psychics, spiritualists, “energy healers,” and astrologersnear the end of her life has been attributed to everything from her desperationfor love to her suspected borderline personality disorder. The lonely royal lostherself in a bewildering cocktail of alternative therapists—includingastrologers, reflexologists, psychoanalysts, and soothsayers. Diana’s psychicssay they predicted Diana’s violent death, but none of them were able to usetheir powers to stop it.Diana’s obsession with the spiritual led her to have treatments such asfortnightly colonic irrigation and massage.One astrologer persuaded Diana to strap fossils to her legs to put her in touchwith her ancestors. All they did was leave white scrapes along her calves.Diana’s psychics also sent her into paranoid frenzies by predicting there wereplots to kill her in car crashes, while another of her clairvoyants, SimoneSimmons, told her she could see a “vast black whirlwind of energy” on the sideof Diana’s bed where a partner might sleep.Diana also once sat under a Perspex pyramid with a healer called Madame Vasso,who told her the practice would produce “good energy.” Vasso is believed to beone of two psychics (the other is Rita Rogers) referred to by Diana assister-in-law Sarah Ferguson’s “witch-woman.”Vasso later published a kiss-and-tell book on Ferguson in which she dished thedirt on her extramarital affairs, the squalid state of her finances, and herviews on her in-laws. The princess’s former private secretary Patrick Jephsonsaid that Sarah Ferguson’s medium also told Diana that Prince Charles would diein a crash.Patrick—a former lieutenant commander in the Royal Navy who worked for Dianafrom 1990 to 1996—revealed the princess told him in 1990, “Fergie’s witch-womansays my husband is going to be killed! She sees mountains and a helicopter!”He said he tried to treat such predictions as a joke and added, “A little lateron, I give my response to the princess as being, ‘Yes, ma’am, any tips for the3:30 at Kempton?’”But Patrick said psychics had a devastating effect on Diana’s mental health,revealing the paranoid princess fell for more and more outlandish claims towardthe end of her life.The identity of the other candidate for Diana’s “witch-woman” nickname is RitaRogers, who met Diana through the duchess and told her the brake cables of hercar would be cut.Patrick said he was worried Diana put so much faith in astrologers andsoothsayers because this “fed the paranoia that never lurked far beneath thesurface.”Other spirituality skeptics such as Diana’s former bodyguard Ken Wharfe put herobsession with them down to her hunt for “solutions and answers” to a mass ofproblems—including the royal’s tormented childhood to divorce and failedrelationships.Others still—including Prince Charles—believe she suffered from a borderlinepersonality disorder that convinced her she could hear voices she thought werecoming to her from some form of afterlife. Many believe she was so neurotic thatshe hated being alone and was on a relentless search for those who would listento her problems. Others thought she was trying to fill the voids she felt fromCharles’s cruelty and her early abandonment by her mother, who chose to leaveher family for her lover.But Diana’s fixation on the spiritual may also have been connected to herconstant fear the royals were plotting to take her out in a violent hit. She mayhave seen getting in touch with psychics while she was alive as a way oflearning how she could stay in touch with the living after she was killed.Along with the fact that psychics played into Diana’s paranoia and gave herpeople to speak to (for a fee), the royal was probably also fixated on theirworld, as she had a morbid fascination with death and dissection that borderedon an interest in the occult.Diana once helped her best friend, Rosa Monckton, bury her stillborn child inthe grounds of her Kensington Palace home. Business executive Rosa—now agedsixty-six with two children—and her newspaper editor husband, Dominic Lawson,tragically lost their daughter to stillbirth.When Diana heard of the heartbreak, she suggested the pair choose the palacegrounds as their child’s final resting place. But it wasn’t only an act ofkindness—the ceremony was tinged with touches of the occult. Diana had her twomost loyal butlers, Harold Brown and Paul Burrell, secretly dig the child’sgrave.She had told security it was a hole for a dead pet.And, in a misty early morning ceremony in March 1994, Diana, along with RosaMonckton and Dominic, then editor of Spectator magazine, crunched over thegravel drive from Diana’s apartment to mourn a child her friends had namedNatalia.In the shadow of Kensington Palace’s vast west wall, Rosa read a verse over thedirt grave by Rabindranath Tagore, India’s greatest poet and Nobel Prize winner.Afterward, Diana gave Rosa a key to the garden, which she still owns to thisday.Diana’s fixation on the afterlife only grew in the three years leading up to herdeath.On that fateful Saturday, August 30, 1997, Diana and Dodi flew from Olbiaairport in Sardinia to Le Bourget airport on the outskirts of Paris, arriving atabout 3:20 p.m. They were not alone.With them was Diana’s holistic healer Myriah Daniels, along with bodyguardsTrevor Rees-Jones, Kieran “Kez”’ Wingfield, René Delorm (Dodi’s butler), andDeborah Gribble (Chief Stewardess on the Jonikal).Masseuse and spiritual healer Myriah had been introduced to Diana whileholidaying on the Jonikal with Dodi.“I have a natural gift for being able to fix the human body,” she told theinquest into Diana’s death. “I do treat the whole person—I am a minister ofnatural spiritualism.”There were four practitioners of the supernatural who were linked most closelyto Diana.Here, the royal’s three most prominent psychics—together with her personalastrologer—reveal what was behind the princess’s obsession with the afterlife.Three of the four have one thing in common—all claim they predicted Diana’sdeath just before her crash—and all admit their spiritual powers were not enoughto save her.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------SIMONE SIMMONSSimone would speak to the princess for up to ten hours straight on the phone andclaims to still hear her voice now—opining, in Diana’s afterlife, on her family,Meghan Markle, and global politics.Like other psychics, she claims to have predicted the Mercedes crash in whichDiana died—but got the color of the car wrong, saying it was blue and not blackin her vision of her friend’s final moments.The Londoner, fifty-nine, once told a journalist from The Guardian, she would“NEVER, EVER” talk about Diana.Yet one year later she wrote a book about her four-year friendship with theprincess, called Diana: The Secret Years.Undeterred, in 2005 she published another book, Diana: The Final Word and hasbecome a “rent-a-quote” in Britain every time there is a major royalevent—tabloid speak for a source who will spill without pressure.When Meghan Markle announced that she was pregnant, it did not take psychicabilities to predict Simmons would soon be channeling Diana’s spirit so the deadroyal could share her opinion on the news with the world.The resulting conversations from beyond the grave made easy headlines, withSimmons sharing in-depth observations from Diana such as the former princess’sjoy that Meghan’s mum is around to give her security.In the past year, Simmons has also made news by using her psychic powers topredict Harry and Meghan will be divorced in less than three years.An alternative healer who claims to have recognized her powers as a child whenshe used touch to cure a cat of kidney disease, Simmons met Diana in 1992 at theHale Clinic, an alternative medicine center in Marylebone, London.She was close to Diana until a year before the royal’s death, becoming one ofthe friends she purged from her friendship circle as she became increasinglyisolated and withdrawn, filled with dreams of moving abroad. On her many visitsto Diana at Kensington Palace, she cleared the princess’s head—and apartment—of“magnetic imbalances.”Simmons says she recently chatted with Diana’s ghost about Brexit, and herformer client told that although she thinks Kate Middleton is “perfect,” shedoesn’t believe Meghan is the ideal woman for Harry.In an exclusive to this book, she sheds light in the passage below on theprincess’s life based on their intimate chats when the royal was living. (Sheinsists she was never romantically involved with Dodi—despite photographicevidence to the contrary—and says her desire was to settle in the suburbs withher heart surgeon lover Hasnat Khan.)Here is Simone Simmons speaking of Princess Diana in her own words.She saw lots of wacky astrologers.Some of the things she did were beyond the pale. One time she came in to see meand she had white stripes on her leg. She said she had been to see a healerrecommended to her by the duchess of York who had taped fossils to her legs, andshe had to walk around with them.One time she was driving home from seeing me and she said her brakes failed inheavy traffic.She bumped into the car in front of her and after making sure the driver wasokay, she abandoned her car and jumped into a taxi to go home. She wasterrified. She said, “They’re trying to bump me off.”By they, she said she meant M15 or M16. She didn’t have any evidence whatsoever.All she knew is that they saw her as a loose cannon. I told her she should gether brakes checked. I said she should check to see if they had been tamperedwith.Diana wrote me a letter that read, “Dear Simone, as you know, the brakes of mycar have been tampered with. If something does happen to me, it will be MI5 orMI6 who will have done it.”She wrote that letter sometime before the report came back from the garage. Shesaid she was writing it as a precaution, just in case something happened to her.Until she had that report in her hand, she was terrified. She was looking overher shoulder all the time. She said she had a funny feeling she was not going tomake old bones. She said that repeatedly over four years.She heard other psychics deliver premonitions that she would marry one of theEuropean princes. She consulted dozens of psychics asking the same question,“Would she and Charles get back together again?” They all said yes, includingRita Rogers.That was the worst thing. She was totally ripped off for thousands of pounds bypeople telling her what she wanted to hear. What she was looking for was someoneto say, “You will fall in love, you will live happily ever after.” She wanted toknow if it would happen and more importantly, when. She wanted genuine love morethan anything.Diana once got a threatening phone call telling her to stop her support foranti-land-mine campaigns during which she was told, “Accidents can happen.”She shrugged it off. She had an inkling who it was…she recognized the voice asone of Charles’s supporters.I had a vision of an accident with a blue Mercedes with four people in it. Itold Diana and Paul Burrell. I didn’t know who was in the car—but I did see ablue Mercedes. The saddest time was the state of shock I was in when I heard ofher death. For days it was a total surreal experience. For days, it was likeeverything was going in slow motion around me. I was at home when I heard thenews, and I was totally in a state of shock.Diana was a good psychic—and a sensitive and great healer. She told me of theresults of the people she had healed. She was good, very good. There was alovely picture of her when in Pakistan with her hand over the head of a littleboy. That’s Diana in healing mode. Diana also kept a copy of the Quran by herbedside.First, she thought of moving to Australia, then she thought about America, whichshe was hoping would be a lot less intrusive than the UK. Being the princess ofWales and the mother of the future King of England, she had her duty to performby being here. Basically, it’s called catch-twenty-two.I considered Diana to be my best friend. I saw her five times a week. We spentGod knows how many hours together on the phone every day. I was Diana’s friend,not Paul Burrell’s friend. Paul was a member of the household. He and I becamefriendly—but I would talk to him in Diana’s presence because Diana was myfriend. I really miss Diana because Diana was a beautiful person with abeautiful soul.It’s very strange how I can still hear her—it’s very weird. I hear her voicespeaking to me about world events and being desperately in love with hergrandchildren.Diana was just trying to be Dodi’s therapist. It wasn’t even a fling. She didn’tfancy him in the slightest. Why on earth would she have tried to make HasnatKhan jealous if she really liked Dodi?From that point of view, she was really naive emotionally. She shouldn’t havebeen with him, but she saw how I was when I was trying to help people withaddictions. He was selfish to the core.She was still in love with Hasnat Khan and she’s not that sort of person. Dianahad a type. Dodi was certainly no brain surgeon.She tended to go for more intelligent men, especially as she got older. She wasalways attracted to men with intelligence who were thoughtful. She didn’tespecially like men with hairy backs. You know how you talk about these thingswith your friends. When we started talking, we were both saying, “Eww.”All Diana wanted to do was make the world better. Dodi was, I suppose, a littledistraction to that. She was trying to get him healed because he wanted to getmarried to this woman Kelly Fisher (who Dodi became engaged to before dumpingher in favor of Diana). That’s why they went out looking at engagement rings.She tried to tell people there was no relationship and nobody took the blindestbit of notice. She always kept her love affairs secret. Hasnat was secret fortwo years, except for me and a few others. While she was with the heart surgeon,Diana dreamed of a very different life away from the spotlight. When she waswith Hasnat she quite often talked about the semi in suburbia, two up two down.We had to be realistic. It was nice to dream. Everyone likes to dream whenthey’re happy and in a different world, in a dreamworld, she could do it. Butshe wouldn’t have had a quieter life, she’d always have been doing herhumanitarian work.Her next massive project, and she’d already had meetings with Benazir Bhutto,was to stop child slavery in Pakistan. It was a huge project, really huge. Shewanted the government to put the children into education and make doctors,scientists, lawyers to make the country leaders in the field. Can you imaginetaking on a project like that?When Diana was alive, she was the bright, spiritual healing in the world. Whenshe died, that went—and look at the state the world’s been in ever since.You don’t see celebrities going out in the middle of nowhere where it’sdangerous.She used to fork out money from her own pocket for charity.Of course, in addition to her charity work, her main focus in life was her sonsWilliam and Harry. Sometimes Harry (he was twelve when Diana died) would skipschool so that he could have Diana all to himself, so he didn’t have to shareher with William. He’d sit on her lap with his head snuggled into her shoulder,sucking his thumb. Even at ten or eleven, he liked to be with her. His motherwas his best friend at that time. Harry didn’t have any best friends. She was.He was really cute. He wanted me to decide what color his bedroom was going tobe.She always loved Charles, even before she died.She got angry with him of course, but I don’t think there was ever a minute shestopped loving him. Before she died, he kept popping over for cups of tea or touse the toilet. Any excuse. I even said, “Oi, what’s going on here?’After Hasnat had called it off with her, she did wonder if her and Charles couldever get back together but it was no, “Camilla will never let go.”In 1996 she told him to make her an honest woman and he didn’t. For Diana itmeant a lot even though he was free to do so. It was quite symbolic in manyways. I think it speaks volumes.He was still in love with Diana. If they would have got married maybe six yearslater, she would have grown up a bit and they had the same interests, they hadso much in common—organic farming, alternative medicine.They would have made a go of it. I don’t believe there would have been anysplit. She wouldn’t have allowed Camilla to come between them. She truly wasnaive. She didn’t know.Before Diana died, we did have a very long talk, and she said, “What do I tellmy boys about love and marriage, because mine didn’t work?”We decided that as far as love goes, the best match would be to be married totheir best friend. Someone they can talk to and share everything with, offloadon to. Someone they can lean on because of the pressure of their job. Just beingprinces is really hard work. So, they need someone they can totally depend on.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------SALLY MORGANThe sixty-eight-year-old psychic Sally Morgan claimed to have predicted PrincessDiana’s death in 1997. Specifically, she claimed she’d foreseen a woman beingpulled from a car wreck in a tunnel, who she first thought was the queen, butlater realized was princess of Wales. But Sally—known as “Psychic Sally” and whoself-identifies as “the UK’s best-loved psychic”—failed to tell Diana of herpremonition.She also, damningly, failed to foresee her own bankruptcy approaching. And forthis reason, some have cast doubt on her Diana claims.In 2018, Sally Morgan Enterprises went into voluntary liquidation following an£2.9 million accelerated payment notice claim by the taxman. And for thepaycheck, on August 16, 2018, Morgan entered the Celebrity Big Brother house, aBritish reality television staple, finishing fifth place.Yet her bankruptcy came directly as a result of being hit by a string ofscandals that called into question her psychic abilities.In 2011 at a show in Dublin, Sally was troubled by a voice from the otherside—the other side of the curtain at the Grand Canal Theatre.An audience member accused her of being fed every line she spoke from anassistant—something Sally later denied, but which earned her death threats. At apublic show in 2012, Morgan gave a reading to two members of the audience, DrewMcAdam and his wife Elizabeth. The reading described a man called Toby who haddied in an explosion. However, prior to the show, Drew and his wife say they fedMorgan this information by emailing her website and leaving notes in a boxprovided in the foyer for so-called “love letters.”Two years later, in March 2014, Morgan became embarrassed during a performanceafter contacting the spirit of a woman who was still alive in the audience.It’s unlikely the controversies would have put Diana off using the medium.When she first met Sally, Diana gave her an old-fashioned green milk bottle shekept as an ornament at Kensington Palace after the psychic admired it—whichSally still has now at her home in a leafy crescent of Reigate, Surrey insoutheast England.And, poetically, Sally continued to milk their relationship.In fact, Sally’s relationship with Diana led her to fill two-thousand-seattheaters with $40-a-ticket shows before sitting in the foyer afterward signingher DVD, Psychic Sally On the Road.Among her other celebrity clients were Uma Thurman and Diana’s friend GeorgeMichael.Here, in her own words, are her claims regarding the princess:I am quite well-known for having seen the princess of Wales for at leastfour-and-a-half years. I was her medium and would speak to her almost on a dailybasis. I used to see her sister as well, her sister, Sarah McCorquodale. She wasthe go-between, really, for us. I met the princess of Wales through her dresser,who was called Helena.I spoke to Diana nearly every day for four years, including on Christmas Day andBoxing Day.I predicted something the year before and was told by a member of the royalfamily four days after Diana’s funeral that they’d listened to the tape of thereading the year before, and it was basically predicting that.I did predict the princess of Wales’s death. What happened was that she visitedme, like she did every week, really. Sometimes three times a week she would cometo the house. At this particular time, I said to her, “Oh, I can see the queen,she’s going to die.” Sarah said, “Oh, what do you mean? How?” I said, “Well, Ifeel as if she’s being pulled out the back of a car by her legs, and hershoulders, and her head is in the stairwell at the back of the car. And I cansee a gray pavement, and it’s very dark above her.” So, I said, “She’sdefinitely in a car, and she’s definitely being pulled out onto a pavement, andI can see people trying to give her CPR, or bashing her chest.” Then I went, “Ithink it might be a tunnel. It was dark.”Sarah went, “Okay.” She wasn’t that shocked.“Okay.” I said, “And about a week later, the Queen Mother will die.”It didn’t even dawn on me. Then four days after the funeral of the princess ofWales, I received a phone call one morning, and it was from Sarah and she said,“Oh, hello, Sally.” And I was really shocked that she just called me, andbecause to be very honest, I doubted I’d hear from any of them ever again.She said, “Oh, I guess a couple of things I wanted to sort of just say to you.”I said, “Yes?”The first thing she asked me was, did I think it was an accident. Then she saidto me, “You do know that you predicted the princess of Wales’s death.”I said, “I did not.” She said, “Yes, you did, Sally. I have the tape.” Because Iused to record it when she used to come. I said, “Well, what did I say?” BecauseI couldn’t remember. She said, “Well, you actually said you could see the queenbeing pulled out the back of a car onto a pavement and being given CPR.”A week later, at the princess of Wales’s funeral, was the Queen Mother’sfuneral, because the royal family and heads of state and people of that ilk,they rehearse their funerals all the time, no matter what age they are.Because that was the next funeral that had been rehearsed: The Princess of Walesbasically had the funeral of the Queen Mother, even though the Queen Mother wasstill alive. All the pomp and pageantry that went with it. That was rehearsedfor the Queen Mother. So, she said to me, “We feel you predicted it.” So, Isaid, “Oh, really? Who’s that, then?” And she said, “Well, we’ve all…” Shedidn’t say, she just said, “We’ve all listened to the tape.”Diana would definitely want the facts to be revealed.She’d be torn between it all being dragged up again and upsetting her boys. ButWilliam and Harry are men now, so they can handle it. I think they want thetruth, too. But I think it’ll be two hundred years before it comes out. It’ll bePrince George’s grandchildren who’ll allow the truth to be printed.I was never really able to be friends with Diana, as she was being closelyguarded by the royal family. If you ever are involved with the royal family atthat level you never ever are friends with them, there will always be a massivelead door between them and you.They literally live in a Big Brother house. From the moment you sign up to be inthat family you are in a Big Brother house. I think she was looking for someoneto tell her everything was going to be okay and that she would find love.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------RITA ROGERSRomany psychic and self-declared “priestess,” Rita Rogers did little toameliorate Diana’s fears of being killed. Self-styled spiritual adviser Rita,who had regular sessions with the princess, has confessed she warned Diana shehad a forewarning that the brakes of her car had been tampered with.It was far from her last prediction of doom issued to a terrified Diana.She also made the extraordinary claim at her first meeting with Dodi she had “afeeling of danger” about Diana.Warming to her story, she claimed she saw a black Mercedes and a tunnel, and“felt a connection with France.”Diana was put on to Rita by none other than the duchess of York, who was said tohave turned to the psychic for advice after separating from Prince Andrew.The duchess was consoled by a prediction she was not destined to remain alone,but that she would marry a US president.Diana started to use Rita Rogers to try and contact her deceased father to healher childhood wounds. Three years after their introduction, Diana and Dodi flewto Rita’s home on the warm Tuesday evening of August 12, 1997. The couple’scream and green helicopter aroused the suspicion of locals when it hovered overthe small Derbyshire village of Lower Pilsey looking for the correct address.Finally, the helicopter landed in a field, normally a paddock grazed by severalhorses.Diana and Dodi had dropped out of the sky to spend 90 minutes in the company ofRita, an unremarkable-looking woman then in her mid-fifties. She was working asa discreet psychic charging $45 a session, whose card read, “Rita Rogers,Medium. Private sittings and phone readings.” Diana and Dodi’s visit came onlynineteen days before the couple died.Rita was one of the last people to speak to Diana, in a call on Saturday, August30, 1997.Here, in her own words, she tells how she warned Diana to come home during theirconversation and how she is still puzzled why her psychic powers failed to savethe princess’s life.Diana rang at least once a week to see how I was as well as for readings. Shewas very fond of Dodi. She rang me at 4 p.m., nine hours before the crash, totell me she was in Paris and Dodi had gone to get the ring. But I know she wasstill very fond of Charles.She was the same age as one of my daughters and I was a bit of a mother figurefor her. She used to tell me, “As soon as I hear your voice, Rita, it calms medown.”You couldn’t pull the wool over Diana’s eyes. She could spot a fraud from twentypaces and would have quickly sussed me if I hadn’t been genuine.I’d told her she would meet a man of foreign descent with the initial D onwater—and that the man would be connected with the film industry.Not long after, she rang me one days and said, “Rita, guess where I am? I’m on aboat with a man I’ve just met called Dodi Fayed.”Diana had visited several times before on her own, and we spoke regularly asfriends. I’d read for her several times, of course, but not on this occasion.She wanted me to meet Dodi, and while I did a private reading for him, she satin the sunshine on the patio with Mo and waited until we had finished.As she came in, Diana said, “We’ve got about an hour, Rita, before the press gethere”—she was well aware of the problems with the press, and never wanted tomake things difficult for me. That was her way, thinking of others.Sure enough, the press came.Diana rang several times, saying how sorry she was for the trouble she’d causedme—although, Lord knows, it was nothing to what she experienced every day—andthe next day a motorcycle courier arrived from Kensington Palace with a packagefor me.Inside was a gold necklace of interlinked hearts because, as Diana told me, “Youhave a heart of gold.” I was bowled over by it—it was such a lovely gift.The necklace, from Diana’s favorite jewelers, Van Cleef &Arpels, was accompaniedby a handwritten note on her personalized Kensington Palace notepaper.It read, “Dearest Rita, This necklace was made for you and comes with so muchlove to a very special lady with an extraordinary gift…from, Diana xx.”She didn’t pay for readings and always sent me pink lilies on her birthday. Butthis was something really special, because of the thought behind it.I’d read for Dodi before over the phone, but on this occasion, I read for him inperson. He was so interested, because of what Diana had told him about me, andhad asked to visit me.When I read for him that day, I warned him about the accident—specific detailsof the color of the car, the tunnel, and told him to always use his own driver.Although I had no idea of the timing or the fact that Diana would be with himwhen it happened. My reading had been for him, and not for her.Dodi was so in love with Diana, there’s no doubt about that. And they were veryhappy—it warmed your heart to see them together.Would they have married? I don’t know, but I do know that Diana would never havedone anything that would have caused a problem for her sons. They were herabsolute priority.But there’s also no doubt that they were in love. She was radiant, the happiestI’d ever known her.She wasn’t interested in my work with celebrities but in my work with bereavedparents and parents of missing children. I’ve sometimes been asked to help withcases like that.I woke up at 1 a.m. for some reason and saw on the television that Dodi had diedin a car crash. I rang her mobile, but only got her voice mail. I have helped tosave so many lives in the past by giving warnings in time.I don’t understand why I couldn’t save her.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------DEBBIE FRANKPoring over Diana’s astrology chart during their meeting at Kensington Palace onJuly 30, 1997, Debbie Frank and Diana spotted an eclipse—an occurrence that canlead to a life-changing episode.Diana interpreted it as something positive happening for her. A month later shewas in Paris with Dodi.Debbie and Diana were first introduced by a mutual friend in 1989 and stayed inregular contact, with Diana using astrology as “therapy.”After their first meeting, Diana called Debbie, who also read for Britishtelevision presenter Anthea Turner and Carry On actress Barbara Windsor, to askwhat her chart said about her then-husband Charles’s affair with Camilla ParkerBowles.Diana got so hooked on Debbie’s readings she even rang her public hotline if shecouldn’t get through on the stargazer’s private number.She’d also call every Christmas from Sandringham before her separation fromCharles in 1992.The astrologer, who lives in southwest London, first met William and Harryduring one of her visits to Kensington Palace in 1991, and also read theircharts for Diana.Here, she tells of the day of the eclipse reading, Diana’s desperate calls forreadings, and her pain over never getting the queen’s approval.Out of the blue I got a call. I was stunned.She was so candid and open. She said, “Can you talk me through all of thedifficulties I’ve been going through? My husband has gone back to his lady, it’sbeen hell.”We immediately hit it off. She’d call up to three times a day and say, “I’m justchecking in,” or “I just wanted to hear your voice.” She would even ring myhotlines if she couldn’t get in touch with me. She wanted to know if everythingwas going to turn around in her life.I remember once, in 1991, she was on a yacht off the coast of Greece having asecond honeymoon with Prince Charles.She was worked up because she’d discovered Camilla’s number was the last onedialed from their shared telephone. Diana said, “This marriage is a sham, what’sthe point, so much for a second honeymoon.”She would say she was having a “grim” time and tell how the royals competed togive the “meanest and stingiest” gifts. She’d sneak upstairs to avoid the rigidfamily traditions. One year she said Charles bought her some hideous earrings.Diana always looked glamorous and made-up but she liked to relax. She nevercooked for herself, but she’d eat dinner in front of the television watchingCoronation Street or classic films. Her favorite was From Here to Eternity.Diana lavished her with presents including an enamel Asprey box and a scarletCeline handbag, as well as flowers, jackets, and scarves.Diana confided in me about everything.She was always respectful about the queen but wanted her approval and never gotit. She was infuriated that it couldn’t work between her and Charles.After the divorce, which Diana described as a big release, she discussed her newpartners. Diana described heart surgeon Hasnat Khan, who she dated for twoyears, as utterly drop-dead gorgeous.Initially she said Dodi Fayed was a flash in the pan but later said she hadgrown really fond of him and his family. We were looking at her chart and I saidto Diana, “Oh there’s an eclipse.” Diana was happy because we decided it was thestart of a new life.Significant things happened to her when there was an eclipse—like the separationannouncement from Charles and the birth of William. She seemed calm, happy, andoptimistic about the future and told me, “My life is moving in a different way.”She saw it as a positive. She was really happy with Dodi, was spending more timewith the boys and embarking on more work as an ambassador. We thought thealignment could be a positive.I had taken Camilla’s chart too because Diana wanted to read both.I remember the day vividly. She looked radiant, full of life; she had put onweight from the gaunt person I’d first met.She was in a pink Versace dress with a tulip neckline, in tribute to her friend,fashion designer Gianni, who had been killed days before. We had an impromptureview of her life.We then looked at Camilla’s chart and I told her that Camilla had a tough timeahead. She said, “That will be because Charles always blows hot and cold.”We had no idea Diana’s fate would be linked to that tough time. Then we wentthrough hers. I didn’t think for one minute that something so dreadful wouldoccur. I gave her a big hug and she waved me off.I spoke to her after that meeting, in a final phone call, and she soundedwonderful and told me, “I’m the happiest I’ve ever been.”I had no idea she would die. I would never have been able to stop it. Let’s getone thing clear—astrologers can’t predict death.So, I couldn’t tell her not to get into a car, or to stay at home. Some thingsare tragic fate.Diana’s strong connection to the supernatural and otherworldly could not havedone otherwise than to foreshadow her death—a death which would shake thefoundations the world’s most powerful entities. Some energy from the other sideseemed to be reaching through. To guide her? To warn her? It is impossible toknow. It is likewise unknowable if Diana could have altered her fate.Was her doom her destiny?Yet what remains clear is that the forces reaching out in the aftermath of heraccident—from the land of the dead, living, or make-believe—were the mostpowerful on earth. And they wanted a very precise story told.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------DETECTIVE’S NOTEBOOKDATELINE: The next day, investigation week two, September 1997I woke early the next morning refreshed, and keen to tackle any new angle: thepossibility of a second car. I’d need to comb the eyewitness accounts for cluesabout where to start.Having purchased my usual range of newspapers during my dawn perambulations, Ipositioned myself in a cozy arcade coffee shop near my Hôtel Chopin and settledin for a long breakfast. I had maintained a habit of scanning the daily pressfor anything new, anything on the paparazzi. To date nothing had caught my eye;it was all starting to repeat itself. Being the ninjas of the media, thepaparazzi had made their comments in the early days, insofar as they pursued theMercedes from a distance as it raced from the Pont d l’ Concorde and afterlosing sight of the vehicle, they came upon it in the tunnel after the crash.Had the paparazzi witnessed anything sensational or of evidentiary value I feltsure they would have been clamoring to sell it to the highest bidder. Such isthe nature of the beast. No such stories appeared. There was no smoking gun;there were no tales of suspicious characters fleeing the area or odd behavior,just another dead end. I needed a new direction, a way through the forest andinto the clearing and I needed it soon.I folded today’s addition to my paper collection under my arm and headed backupstairs to my room. There I began the search in earnest, even scanning some ofthe older broadsheets I had kept hoping for something, anything. Many of thewitness accounts of that night in August were actually recorded by journalistsand ended up plastered all over the newspapers and the electronic media. Inquite a few ways the journalists were acting as the investigators, albeitwithout the training to sort the false from the true.I found an account from a local taxi driver, Malo France, who declared to theworld’s media that he had found himself in the tunnel seconds after thecollision had occurred. Working the night shift, he had been taking a fare to ahotel in the sixteenth arrondissement and had navigated the obvious shortcut,through the tunnel at Pont de l’Alma. As one of the very first at the scene,only moments behind the Mercedes, he claimed to have made the sign of the crossas he stepped toward the mangled mess. Malo recalled “seeing a woman’s blondehair…she seemed to have fallen into the front of the car…she was crawling backto her rear seat when…(he) heard a woman cry.” Rescue workers a few minuteslater found the princess in the rear of the vehicle on the floor, lodged betweenher seat and the back of the front seat. The taxi driver insisted that theprincess appeared to have been tossed around the cabin. This proved importantconfirmation of a theory that had been circulating since the tragedy: that LadyDiana Spencer had not been wearing a seat belt at the time of the collision.Inside Malo’s taxi cab were two Americans: Mike, a rock-and-roll promoter andhis buddy, Stan, a personal injury lawyer from Ohio. They too were caught up inthe melee of mayhem that followed the tragedy. Both recalled the appallingconduct of the paparazzi, taking photographs over and above rendering assistanceto the injured and dying. Mike believed that the Mercedes had flipped over. Heoffered no substantiation for his conviction other than it was an impression hegathered from the ruinous condition of the car (again, an indication of theextraordinary speed at which it was traveling). None of these first threewitnesses at the scene offered any information indicating foul play orsuspicious activity. As I read, I began to ponder whether any otherinternational visitors may have witnessed the accident. Paris was a hugetourist-based hub; upon reflection, it would have been unlikely not to be thecase. As I let this notion take root my attention was captured by one of themore dog-eared publications in my possession.One of the first witnesses to surface with a story for the newshounds had been aFrenchman by the name of François Levi. On the face of it, Mr. Levi’s storysuggested damningly that the paparazzi had a great deal to do with the threedeaths. On the night of the accident, the former harbor pilot, according tonewspaper documentation, had enjoyed a Saturday evening out with his wife at thePlanet Hollywood nightclub in Paris and was on his way home to Normandy, aregion of France three hours to the west of the capitol. I read the story withgreat interest and began to track Mr. Levi’s comments in my notebook, makingbullet points, checking for logic and feasibility.François claimed to have been two cars ahead of a dark Mercedes when, in hisrearview mirror, he noticed a motorcycle with two riders dart out in front ofthe car. His eyes, he reported, were then momentarily dazzled by a brilliantflash of light. He went on to disclose that he heard, but didn’t see, the impactas the Mercedes careered into pillar thirteen. I felt my brow furrow as Ipondered how Mr. Levi could have known that the Mercedes had hit the pillar whenhe claimed to have already left the tunnel by then. I reread his statementnoting the fact that he clearly indicated that he and his wife, upon hearing thecollision, had initially pulled over to the curb outside the tunnel and stoppedfor a moment. I had walked that exit many times over; the roadway has a sharpascent making any view to the rear highly improbable. He couldn’t have seen thepillar if he were outside the tunnel. My crackpot senses began to tingle.Mr. Levi continued stating that both he and his wife feared that the accidentwas a “terrorist attack.” A terrorist attack? I had considered the possibilitywhile back in Melbourne but had seen absolutely nothing at the crime scene togive any credence to pursuing this line of inquiry. Still, here was a localFrenchman and his wife offering suspicion of a terrorism link in the deaths ofDodi, Princess Diana, and their driver. The plot was thickening. François didn’tattempt to explain how the couple had come to their conjecture; he just statedthat this was their firm belief. And his sensational comments had naturallyfound him on the front page of virtually every newspaper in the world. What wasthis “witness” up to? Curious to see what else he had to say, I read on.The Levis, François continued, had then elected to drive on home, all the way toNormandy. This would have had them arrive well after 4 a.m. And it was not untiltwelve hours after their tunnel experience, “lunchtime Sunday,” that he and hiswife became aware of the identities of the persons involved in the accident,when they turned on their TV at home. Continuing to bamboozle with his logic,Mr. Levi then boasted of recounting his tale to the Fayed family lawyer thatvery day. There were now so many questions racing at me. Why would a Normandyman go to Paris for a Saturday night out and then suffer a three-hour drivehome, after midnight? Why not stay the night in a hotel? More worrisome, howwould a native from Normandy know who the lawyers for the Fayed family were? Andhow did he manage to make contact with the law firm on a Sunday? Perhaps onlyminutes after finding out the accident involved Lady Diana. Mr. Levi wouldsurely become more infamous for proving that he could contact a lawyer on theSabbath than he would be for witnessing the accident that claimed the life ofPrincess Diana. But the most disturbing segment of his statement for thisdetective would unquestionably have to be: Why didn’t he report his observationsto the French cops immediately after he saw the lunchtime news, as would anyaverage citizen? Surely locating a policeman on a Sunday would have been easierthan tracking down the Fayed family lawyers?Reading François’s account stirred feelings of suspicion; not for terrorists atthe scene, but for meddling from the wings. The Fayeds’ lawyer, on the basis ofthe statement had called for an investigation for manslaughter, quoting chapterand verse from a statement still unseen by the police. François did notenlighten his country’s law enforcement officers with his account until later inthe following week. The whole matter of this testimonial smacked ofskullduggery, causing me to ponder if perhaps all was not what it seemed indowntown Paris. Why was the Fayed family attempting to manage François, and whendoes a Frenchman use the word “curb,” listed in the Oxford dictionary as anEnglish word, to describe the side of the road?Frustrated, I gathered up a large stack of francs and marched purposefullydownstairs offering them up to Charles at the reception desk of my hotel. He hada payphone on the wall at reception. My goal: to telephone Mr. Levi. To talkover his revelation, and most of all to ask him how he came to the conclusionthat the accident was a terrorist attack. Did he possess a skill, a sixth sensethat no detective worldwide had; one that allowed him to sense terrorists?Despite the efforts of a kindly telephone operator, the emptying of Charles’sown pockets and several trips to local stores to replenish my supply of coinage,I was never able to locate him.Yet, despite being invisible, his sensational story was being used to sully thewaters and create a backdrop of terrorism. But why? Who was behind it, who waspressing his buttons? I had my suspicions. The fact that the newspapers reportedhis statement didn’t add any credibility to his story; it merely informed theworld that there were stooges out there, willing to place their good names ondocuments to advance the motives of others who chose to remain veiled, behindthe shroud of a lawyer’s door or a family’s dynasty. I knew enough aboutreporters to know that they would convey (mostly) whatever came their way; afterall, it’s not for them to judge. And on the face of it François Levi’s accountseemed plausible until you analyzed it.I have long known that witnesses can be a strange lot. Some are full of goodfaith and assistance; others are notorious for keeping quiet about what they sawor heard, too scared, too indifferent, reluctant to become involved, or fearfulof being questioned by investigators. Still others, not realizing the importanceof their information, remain silent almost unknowingly. In the case of the AndyWarhol witness, the investigator may well believe that the witness hasfabricated their story, but he must prove it incorrect and discredit thewitness, otherwise the witness may discredit the investigation. I thought againabout Mr. Levi and whether this could have been his motivation. However dubioushis account in reality, it remains a fact that mud sticks, and in the mind’s eyeof future generations there would always remain the possibility of terroristinvolvement in this calamity thanks to a man and a wild story.Of course, it was to be expected that a tragedy such as this would attract itsfair share of crackpots as well as conspiracy theories. In only a matter ofhours after the collision, the media gossip pot had already begun to bubble andin no time was ripe to overflowing with an endless run of outrageous conspiracystories fueled by a myriad of sources. All pointed a finger at one or otherindividual groups deemed desirous of the death of Princess Diana and hercompanion. From Arab terrorist organizations to Muslim extremists, MI5 and MI6British Intelligence, and the most absurd of all, that the royal family andPrince Charles himself had orchestrated the tragedy. While these conspiracytheories were never elevated to any status above tabloid nonsense, they troubledthe millions of grieving citizens who followed the progress of the case. It isworth noting that despite there being not a smidgeon of evidence to give any ofthese theories any basis in fact, again, that shadow of doubt remains over thehistory of the investigation. I feel the need to reiterate here that terrorists,almost without exception, will boast of their involvement (if they have one) inthe assassination of a world figure. There were no such attestations from any inthe case of the death of Princess Diana.I put Mr. Levi and terrorism to bed and went back to my research, returning tomy tried-and-true practice of methodically reading and rereading. I noted thatvarious newspapers made mention of names, hometowns and country of residence ofseveral international tourists who had been in town late in August. I consideredthe idea of contacting some of these possible witnesses. It would be a simplematter of asking an international telephone operator to locate and place a callto them. I let the notion roll around my sensibilities a little, conscious ofthe cost of my last telecommunications endeavor. As I mused, my frustrationsintensified and the disdain I felt toward the French law enforcement system grewexponentially. Had they taken control of the situation when the accident firstoccurred, surely this scenario would have had no opportunity to spin quite soout of control.Unlike the French police, the River Seine, it seemed, had been doing its jobthat balmy Saturday night, drawing the general public to its banks for aromantic stroll or cruise. Chris Gallagher was one such reveler, on a cruisethat night with friends. Standing on the open deck, he was admiring the view andsoaking up memories before he had to head home the following day. As his cruisermotored toward the Alma Bridge, Mr. Gallagher recalled hearing the sound of amassive crash. Looking instinctively at his watch, 12:30 p.m., he recalled thatthe lights to the Eiffel Tower had just been extinguished. His recollection herewas correct; they are turned off at exactly half past twelve. Chris acceptedanother glass of wine and turned back to his crowd, unknowing of thesignificance of the noise he had just heard.Strolling the banks of the river at the same time were lovers Tom and Joanna.Also hearing the sound of a massive crash, they ran to the tunnel, where theMercedes’ horn continued to wail and smoke streamed from its twisted form. Theyrecalled a distraught man walking away and uniformed police arriving, weavingtheir way between far too many sightseers. The account from Joanna and her manwas, in effect, more of the same, more evidence indicating nothing but anaccident, followed up by a pack of paparazzi and their 35-millimeter weapons.Jack and Robin Firestone, a couple from New York City, were vacationing in Parison the night of the accident. Having enjoyed a long dinner in a classicrestaurant, they were in a taxicab, attempting passage through the tunnel onlymoments after the accident. With their soft bed seeming only minutes away, theircab came to an abrupt halt; the wrecked Mercedes barred their path. As Jack andRobin stepped from their taxi and cautiously approached the fatal scene, theyrecalled seeing five paparazzi snapping photographs of the mangled car and itsoccupants. They looked on feeling helpless as a blonde woman, obviously PrincessDiana, hung out of the car’s window and the paparazzi clicked away frame afterframe.Then there was Mark Solomon, who was in the area and also heard the terribleexplosion as the Mercedes careered into the thirteenth pillar. Drawn by thecries for help, he was unaware that it was Princess Diana behind a mask of bloodand horror. Mark was particularly disturbed by the lack of effort to save lifeon the part of the first police to arrive, as was Mr. Culbreath, a Britishnational who stumbled upon the scene. The more I learned, the more aware Ibecame of this as a common complaint by passersby: the slow reaction time ofpolice and their lackadaisical manner, more concerned with crowd control thaninitial response duty. However, in fairness to the efforts of the emergencyworkers, at a scene where there are multiple casualties, mere minutes can seemlike hours and perceived tardiness may simply be assistance being rendered withutter precision.CHAPTER NINEThe crash was horrendous, but the response by French police was an abomination.Shockingly, the wreck that killed Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed wasn’t treatedas a crime scene by the French authorities, who quickly removed the car andwashed down the road ready for rush hour the next morning—and with it, literallyall evidence critical to understanding what really happened.More than this, the accident scene itself was allowed to devolve into a place ofchaos.American-born witness Robin Firestone was in a cab that passed into the Almatunnel very shortly after the accident. In an exclusive interview, she describeswhat she saw when her taxi got up to Diana’s wreck.I noticed these dark formal cars and they weren’t moving; they were parked.I didn’t see anybody in them. To my recollection, the windows were dark windows,blacked out windows, so I just thought it was a bizarre sight to see. And Ididn’t focus on that too much because I really now started to see some actionand activity as we made that bend and noticed motorcycles and a lot ofphotographers at that point.There were paparazzi—five, six paparazzi from what I recall. One was veryspecific; I could see it right now in my mind. He was standing in the mediannext to his, I presumed it was his motorcycle because it was right next to him,and he definitely had a camera on his shoulder. But he had a phone in his hand,and he was talking on the phone.There were also police already on the scene, which initially led Firestone tobelieve the matter was being handled. But as her cab continued to creep past theaccident site, the level of disorganization became increasingly clear:I initially thought, “Wow, the police got here really quickly.”One of them was having an argument; there was like a little push fest—physicalpushing back and forth—going on with one of the paparazzi.It was just absolute chaos. There was no protection of the scene at all. At all.We did not witness ever at any point anybody offering to assist or give help. Wedid not see anybody aiding or assisting. There was no ambulance there, there wasno police tape closing off that entrance to the tunnel.Looking back now, this seems unthinkable. However, the public seemed willing toaccept the immediate version of the events that was released. Instead ofwondering about the possibility of a sinister cause of the wreck, everyone’sfocus was on whether or not Diana’s life could be saved.The first physician who treated Diana from the private medical service SOSMedécins called the Service d’Aide Médicale Urgente switchboard at 12:26 a.m. toorder an ambulance. According to French policeman Sebastien Dorzee, who arrivedat the scene with a colleague around 12:30 a.m., “Blood was coming out of hermouth and nose. You could see a deep wound to her forehead. At the same time,she was rubbing her stomach. She must have been in pain. She turned her headtowards the front of the car, and saw the driver. She became agitated. Then sheput her head down again and closed her eyes.”Despite the initial lack of blood on her body, Diana had sustained disastroushead and chest trauma—a hole ripped in her heart by the force of the crash.The small tear, less than an inch long, to one of four of her pulmonary veinsthat proved fatal as it stopped blood being pumped to her heart and body.Emergency surgeons rank damage to the delicate vessels as more serious thanalmost any other wound.Dr. Jean-Marc Martino, the emergency specialist who oversaw the princess’streatment shortly after the crash, recalled that after Diana had groaned “MyGod” when she realized the horror of the crash, she continued to “shout and saythings in English which were comprehensible yet incoherent.”Her agitation was so extreme that at 12:45 a.m.—twenty-two minutes after thecrash—Dr. Martino injected her veins with midazolam and fentanyl—an opioidanalgesic eighty times more potent than morphine—to “calm her down.”Despite the power of the drugs, Diana was so “agitated” she managed to tear thefirst IV drip out of her arm while still trapped in the vehicle.She was thrashing around so forcibly that a medical assistant had to hold herdown while the drip was reinserted.After the drugs kicked in and Diana’s bruised and sedated body was gently movedout of the Mercedes, she went into cardiac arrest at around 1 a.m.Martino performed endotracheal intubation—forcing a tube into the princess’swindpipe through her mouth—to open her airway, placed her on a respirator toventilate her lungs with oxygen, and performed external cardiac massage toreestablish her cardiac rhythm.By the time Diana was gently moved into an ambulance at 1:18 a.m. The so-called“golden hour,” within which critically injured patients are most likely to besaved if they have reached the hospital, was almost up. Medics spent aboutthirty more minutes after Diana’s heart attack treating her in the tunnel.The ambulance didn’t depart the scene until 1:41 a.m., and traveled at a snail’space to the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital as the driver did not want to subject thefragile cargo to shocks and bumps that could send her again into cardiac arrest.Yet Diana’s blood pressure plummeted, prompting the ambulance to stop within afew hundred yards of the hospital so it could be treated—leaving Diana withinabout a thousand feet of surgeons at 2:06 a.m., an exact 103 minutes after heraccident.There were no recorded cases of patients with her same devastating internalinjuries arriving at the hospital alive, Diana’s inquest was told ten years andthree months later.Her final two hours grew more horrific.Though she had no serious external injuries, X-rays taken at the hospitalindicated internal hemorrhaging that was compressing her right lung and heart.Ten minutes after her arrival, at 2:16 a.m., Diana suffered her second cardiacarrest, prompting the doctors to inject large doses of epinephrine (adrenaline)directly into the heart.At around 2:20 a.m. they performed an emergency thoracotomy—opening up her chestcavity to find and suture the wound.The source of her internal hemorrhaging was a single lesion in her leftpulmonary vein at the point of contact with the left atrium.Diana’s bleeding heart was sutured, and the hemorrhaging stopped.For the next ninety minutes, surgeons conducted internal manual massage of herheart, combined with electroshocks.It was impossible to reestablish a heartbeat.The patient was declared dead at 4 a.m. on August 31, 1997.Dr. Stanley Zydlo, a prominent American emergency physician from NorthernIllinois and pioneer in prehospital trauma systems dating to their origin in thelate 1960s and early 1970s, said the seventy-minute prehospital delay in Diana’scase “certainly took away all of her chances” of survival.And what came after that?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------For the purposes of our investigation, we established the followingminute-by-minute time line for the aftermath of Diana’s horrible “Death Day.” Itruns like this:Sunday, August 31, 19973:15 a.m. UK time / 4:15 a.m. Paris and Cape TownIn South Africa, Diana’s brother Charles Spencer hears the news his sister isunlikely to survive surgery while on the phone to his sister, Jane.

She loved pastels andvibrant colors that brought out her fair hair, pale complexion, and blue eyes.She also found the color black terribly depressing and associated it withterrible times, doom and—of course—death. She would have hated the idea if hersons having the final image of her dressed basically as a nun.One of the major moments Diana stepped out wearing black was in 1994, when shewore her so-called plunging “F**k You Dress” to the Serpentine Gallery summerparty. It was the night Prince Charles publicly confessed to his affair withCamilla Parker Bowles [via an interview with Jonathan Dimbleby for a show calledCharles: The Private Man, The Public Role]. Diana used that gown, with itsrevealing neckline, to show him what he was missing. But the use of the dresswas bittersweet for her, and she later auctioned it off as a show that she waserasing evidence of her old life with Charles. After that she rarely woreblack—and the royals knew it. But they still went ahead and laid her to rest insomething they knew she would have hated.“It was their final insult to her,” a palace aide told our investigation.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------As the circumstance of the world’s most-watched funeral played out for millionsin London and billions around the world, Colin McLaren’s investigation led himto Gary Hunter, a London lawyer with connections to Mohamed Al-Fayed and hisfamily.Immediately, Colin’s suspicions were heightened following a meeting with Londonsolicitor Gary Hunter, whose story of car chases, explosions, and supposedterrorists had made him a media star…all while the world mourned.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------DETECTIVE’S NOTEBOOKDATELINE: Investigation week two, September 1997No sooner had I sat back, confident that I was abreast of all those who couldlay claim to having firsthand knowledge of the accident, before an extraordinarynew storyteller popped up. Mr. Gary Hunter, a lawyer with a small-time Londonlegal firm, made it to the front page of the majority of my usual array of localand international newspapers with a chronicle of his holiday in Paris on theweekend of August 30 and 31. Gary was to gain the sort of instant notoriety thatwould be the envy of most public relations experts, and if proven correct, hisobservations could hold the smoking gun to the death of the queen of hearts andmay well alter the entire course of the investigation.I sat in my usual breakfast nook with Gary’s hometown broadsheet, thewell-respected London Times. According to their commentary, Mr. Hunter had beenstaying with his wife on the third floor of a hotel building less than a hundredmeters from the Alma Tunnel. At 12:25 a.m. on that fateful Sunday morning, Garyhad been watching television and heard, “an almighty crash followed by the soundof skidding, then another crash…. (He) went to the window and saw people runningtowards the tunnel…. (He) saw a car turning from the area by the tunnel exit androaring down the Rue Jean Goujon…. (He) heard the screeching of tires…. (He) sawa small dark car…it was racing at 60–70 mph…. There were people in a hurry notto be there.”Interestingly, only a few days earlier the French National Police had releasedthe news that they were searching for a second car, a Fiat Uno. And the streetMr. Hunter mentioned, Rue Jean Goujon, I knew very well; I had knocked on everydoor and spoken to every resident. I only wished the article had been morespecific. I wanted to know exactly where Gary had slept that night. The streethad several accommodation options: bed-and-breakfasts and hotels. I sensedanother round of door knocking in the not-too-distant future and unconsciouslyglanced out of the café window to see what sort of a day Paris was throwing upat me. All fine, I smiled, sipped my coffee, and picked up the next version ofMr. Hunter’s exploits.The information he came forward with was blunt and straight to the point. Therewere two other cars involved in the accident and both disappeared immediatelyafterward, roaring down a street into obscurity. According to Gary, somethingvery suspicious caused the accident, something deliberate and menacinglycalculated. His narration claimed categorically that “it was obvious that theywere getting away from something and that they were in a hurry. I was confidentthey were getting off the scene. It looked quite sinister. It could have been aFiat or a Renault. The car was being shadowed by a second vehicle, a whiteMercedes.”Gary went on to say the smaller car was traveling in close conveyance with thewhite Mercedes:They were bumper to bumper…. They turned from the area by the tunnel and wentroaring down Rue Jean Goujon…. They both spun around together and sped off downthe street at suicidal pace, more than a hundred miles per hour…. (He) thoughtit was very strange that they were traveling so dangerously close to each other.Their behavior made me wonder exactly what they had been up to in the tunnelwhen the crash happened.My detective’s radar was starting to twitch again. This was all sounding alittle too much like dialogue from an espionage movie. I noticed that therecorded speed of the missing vehicles altered dependent on version perused:from sixty miles an hour to one hundred miles an hour and down a skinny one-waystreet, going the wrong way!My first thought was why hadn’t Malo France, the Parisian taxi driver, seen the“sinister” actions of the other two cars? After all, according to Gary, theywere far from inconspicuous, treating the area like a grand prix circuit. Andwhere were Malo France’s passengers’ eyes, the two men in the back of his cabwho lent a hand? Realistically, could they also have missed the near demolitionderby? Then there were Tom and Joanna, the lovers strolling the riverbank; whydidn’t they observe the spectacle? After all, they were almost on top of theaccident scene, in the ideal position. As were the New York diners, on their wayhome in their taxi. I thought a little more about the topography of the tunnel.At over one hundred meters in length, how could anyone see any vehicle, sinisteror not, exiting onto the highway at the far end?As an officer of the courts of London, Gary Hunter would have to be aware of thecorrect procedure when making a statement. And once sworn and signed, he wouldalso be aware to whom that statement should be served. In fact, he would havethe contact details of both the London Metro police and Scotland Yard at hisfingertips. Yet Gary made his evidentiary document three weeks after the event,and to the lawyers acting on behalf of the Fayed family. Here we go again, Ithought.Back up in my hotel room, I located the telephone number for Hepburn Lawyers inLondon, the workplace of this intriguing witness, and put through a call. Myrecent experiences had led to an upgrading of my technological equipment; I nowpossessed a phone card. After only a few short rings a pleasantly efficientvoice informed me that Mr. Hunter was unavailable, but could anyone else be ofassistance? I was connected to another lawyer, Gary’s immediate boss, whogreeted me in a lighthearted manner. Feeling confident that Gary’s workmatesmust all be enjoying the usual banter of his newfound celebrity status, Ilaunched in, boots and all, with this jovial fellow.He listened to my bullet-point version of Gary’s story and claimed in return toknow nothing of the article. Further, he had heard no talk in the office ofGary’s observations, nor was he even aware that Gary had been to Paris thatweekend. Then the phone went silent. I imagined him reaching for a tall glass ofwater. I, in turn, became more fascinated by Mr. Hunter by the minute.Apparently now recovered, Gary’s boss confided that Gary was busy, that I wouldneed to wait but he would attempt to fetch him. Not one for telephone holdmusic, I zoned out for a few minutes as I mentally processed the news that Mr.Hunter was keeping his media tidbits hush-hush from those closest to home. Mymusing state was broken by a cheery hello from the other end of the phone line.Initially Gary seemed buoyant. For a moment I thought he believed me to be anAustralian journalist. I explained that I was simply an Australian tourist, onholidays in Paris, and that I had read his quotes in the world newspapers. Hesounded chuffed, almost pleased. I went on to explain that I’d had a long careerin criminal investigation, having worked on many police task forces, and that Iwould dearly love to catch up with him to discuss his observations. Gary seemedto have trouble clearing his throat.We suffered an overly long pregnant pause, so I switched tactics, congratulatinghim on his observations and his honesty in coming forward. He sounded nervous, alittle unsure of his himself and his story. I heard a stutter in his voice and asinking feeling settled in the pit of my stomach, a feeling that detectivesdread when questioning a man with a story. I was losing him; he would rather beelsewhere.I offered to fly to London that very day to meet with him, perhaps we couldshare a pint and he could fill me in on his remarkable experience? Gary was notso enthusiastic. This was hardly necessary, he offered. I countered, casuallyletting slip that I was traveling to London anyway to visit relatives, socatching up was easy really, my shout for a beer. Reluctantly Gary acquiescedand we locked in a time, agreeing to meet at his office the following day beforelunch. He rang off, no doubt to take a few deep breaths before suffering amyriad of questions from his superior. I admit to a few deep breaths myself. ButI wasn’t ducking questions; I was scrawling them in my notebook, the ideaspopping into my head faster than I could get them down on paper. Mr. Hunterwould have a whole lot more answers to come up with tomorrow.I threw a few essentials into my shoulder bag, added the Gary Hunter presscuttings, and sprinted downstairs to reception, where I begged a favor fromCharles, who was on the desk. Could I rebook my room for the next week and, moreimportantly, could it be left as it was, strewn with papers, sketches, andnewspapers? By now Charles had a good sniff of what I was up to and gave me thenod. He would keep the cleaners at bay until my return. So, with a surge ofadrenaline, I headed for the airport. I had one decent-sized fish on my line,and he wasn’t getting away.Arriving in London late that night, via Heathrow, I found a hotel close to thecenter of town, close to Gary Hunter’s law firm, and took a room. Up early, Ispent little time over my stodgy English breakfast and arrived outside Gary’sLondon law firm well before lunchtime. Nestled among an eclectic mix of studiosand small businesses, I took in the charm of the quaint low-rise office and thenstepped inside. I asked the receptionist if I could see Gary, explaining that Ihad an appointment. She seemed to tune into my Australian accent and hesitated.She looked around at nothing in particular and I sensed an oddness. It was thenthat I was served an English ace. The receptionist explained, “Mr. Hunter isunavailable.” And I was livid.I gave the woman my name and repeated that I had an appointment. My protestsfell on deaf ears; Gary wasn’t keeping my appointment. No longer in the mood togloat of his narrative, he had become celebrity shy overnight. The receptionistlooked embarrassed as she handed me a plain white envelope containing a typewritten note: a briefly worded apology from Gary. It read, “Sorry toinconvenience you, Colin, but I cannot speak of this matter with you, nor can wemeet. I hope you understand.” I stood alone in the foyer; my shoulder bagslumped to the floor. I was gutted.Shuffling over to the plush two-seater guests’ lounge, I dropped my weary bodyand reread the note over and over. My dismay turned to annoyance, and I demandedto speak to the senior partner. My request was denied. There would be no oneavailable to see me, that day or any other day. The receptionist started to getherself busy. The room fell silent, and I left the building feeling totallyduped.I found a nook nearby that allowed for a few hours of surveillance and satobserving the handful of people who came and went. It was only a small firm oflawyers, but none of those who wandered in or out had the appearance of aforty-one-year-old male lawyer. I fully intended to approach anyone that lookedlike he could have been Mr. Hunter and force my meeting. Before long I gave myknuckles a run, knocking on a few of the neighboring offices using the wrongaddress routine, asking if anyone knew Gary Hunter, a lawyer. I was hoping for abetter description, so I never missed him, should he leave in a crowd. No one inthe neighboring businesses knew him and I was starting to become a pest. I hadGary’s number in my back pocket so I found the nearest pay phone and with theruse of a new client recommended to Mr. Hunter, I rang his office. Feigning adodgy English accent, I got past the snooty receptionist and was placed on hold.Gary answered. His game was up. I explained who I was, and let him have half anear full, stating that I wanted a word, a chance to go over his story. Initiallyhe stayed silent. Then he made the simple, nervous comment, “Please Colin, Ican’t talk to you, I am under instructions…. I must ring off.” There was apregnant sense that Gary was about to hang up. I needed to get him to talk, toopen up, but I felt he was shutting me out. With nothing to lose, I went forbroke, I told him that I would be waiting out the front of his office all dayand night to see him. He did not reply. I believed I had a mere few secondsremaining before he did ring off. I added that I considered his evidence ofseeing cars fleeing the tunnel as unlikely. My livid state returned as Gary’ssilence hung. It was then that I knew Gary Hunter was never going to voluntarilymeet me. I offered my suspicion outright and said, “I have been told your lawfirm does occasional work for the group of companies owned by the Fayed family,is that correct?” It was only my belief, but Gary didn’t know that. He remainedsilent. “If I’m wrong, say so.” More silence, which acted as confirmation.I went on to tell him that I considered his statement to be a fraud and that Iintended to prove it. Gary’s reaction was predictable: he slammed down thephone.Deciding that he had to come out sometime, I paced on a street that I was surenow had eyes. But by the close of business mine were the only ones left, staringat locked doors, including the one at the rear. The London lawyer who claimed tohave seen so much had evaded me. With a little less pride than I’d had the daybefore, I set my direction finder to the London underground, destinationHeathrow, and decided to go back to Paris.As I waited in line at the train ticket office, the revelations of the past fewdays circled my brain: a second car, questionable statements from witnesses tiedto the Fayeds. The thought of losing stirred me to back away from the ticketseller and think it through. I had to make use of my time in London, despite thesetback. There was one other major player in this game that I couldn’t afford toleave on the bench. Electing to stay one more night in London, I had it in mindto knock on the door of Harrods the following morning. It was time to meet upwith the inner sanctum: the Al-Fayed group, which, it was beginning to appear,was never too far away from any new exposé concerning the accident on August 31.First it was François Levi, and now the scarlet pimpernel, Gary Hunter.I couldn’t put aside a nagging suspicion that the Al-Fayed camp was aware of myindependent investigation and I considered that the camp was also aware that Ihad spent my whole day standing out the front of a nervous, small-time Londonlawyers’ office looking like a banished colonial. I needed to go shopping atHarrods!At 10 a.m. the following morning, I climbed the stairs to the administrationsection of one of the world’s great department stores and entered a very stylishouter office. Behind an equally impressive reception counter sat a young womanwho welcomed me with her classically upper-class English dialect. I asked if Icould speak to Mr. Mohamed Al-Fayed. She neither confirmed nor denied hispresence in the building; instead, she posed a number of polite questions as tomy reasons to see him. I replied with my standard answer. Visitingdetective—Australian—undertaking an independent study—the tragic deaths inParis. She smiled, again noncommittal, and showed me to a seat, handing me thetop few of a mess of glossy magazines. Opposite, a wall clock ticked loudly forhalf an hour. Then the man himself appeared.Mohamed Al-Fayed was probably better dressed than any man I have ever seen ofhis age. We shook hands, exchanged plastic smiles and introductions. He seemedto accept my qualification as a detective as he glanced me up and down; I wasdressed more for golf than a high-level business meeting. His eyes then lockedonto my shoulder bag. I took the opportunity to pull out a number of my dogearednotebooks to indicate my bona fides. I flicked through my most complete book,highlighting maps, sketches, and measurements, explaining that I’d just comefrom Paris after much research at the accident scene. I looked up to gauge Mr.Al-Fayed’s reaction and was distracted by the presence of a dour-faced manstanding directly behind him. He was edging his way into our conversation, likea man who needed to hear. I soon learned that he was one of Mohamed’s securityexecutives, although he didn’t appear to have his boss’s tailor. An ex-cophimself, he still favored the powder blue shirt with poorly matched tie. Mr.Al-Fayed suggested that I sit with the cheerless fellow and discuss my findings.I didn’t want that and moved in closer to the main man, as if to confide anotation, or measurement from my book. And with that the Egyptian-bornbillionaire was gone, disappearing behind the interior design.Both old brigade law enforcement officers, we started with a little awkwardsmall talk, chewing the fat, searching for a war story in an attempt to breakdown the barriers. It wasn’t working. Chatting resulted in a one-sided,five-minute interrogation, enough time for the security executive to ascertainmy career qualifications and to pose one question, twice, “Have you got anyevidence of Muslim involvement?” I answered in the negative. He crossed anduncrossed his legs and followed up by suggesting that my final report into theParis tragedy would be interesting if it included some suggestion of Muslimterrorist participation. The starkness of the comment hung thickly in the air.He stared at me, as if waiting for me to nod, to talk or to do…anything. My eyesthen followed the pattern in his tie. He then stood, adjusted the crease in histrousers, as was probably an employment requirement, and commenced to move away.Baffled by his lack of professional interest in my findings, I also stood andattempted to redirect the conversation to the facts as I had documented them. Hesmiled dismissively, handed me his business card and suggested that should Ifind “any material of interest” perhaps he would accept a copy of my report.Then he too disappeared. I looked at another English receptionist, but this onewas an expert at looking busy. I shook my head, stuffed my books in my bag, likea failed door-to-door salesman, and descended the grand stairway, then turnedout of the side street entry and caught that overdue train for Heathrow.Back in Paris later that night, Charles, my hotel receptionist, unlike GaryHunter, was true to his word. My cozy little hotel room was a sight for soreeyes after enduring a long wait for what proved to be a bumpy flight back toParis. Gary had proven himself far from a man of honor, failing to show his facefor our meeting, but he had succeeded in wedging himself a spot way deep up inthe back regions of my nostrils. So, although bleary eyed, I awoke the nextmorning determined to sift through his “evidence” and either prove or disprovehis story once and for all. I may not have him, but I still had the newspaperswith his chapter, verse, and quotes of his story. I got to work and bulletpointed every word of his verbatim yarn. My first box to check off: find thehotel room from where Gary Hunter claimed to have made his spectacularobservations.There were several hotel buildings tucked away in the backstreets, but none witha view of the tunnel or the Place de l’Alma. That was my most worrisome problem.Added to this there were no hotel buildings of any kind on the Place de l’Almaitself. Gary mentioned that the street below was Rue Jean Goujon and of hisbeing less than a hundred meters from the Alma Tunnel, but this did not gel withlocal geography. For his observations to have been “100 meters” from the tunnel,he would have to have been staying at “apartment building one” on Cours Albert.I knew that to be incorrect.I recalled my visits to the apartments along the way and the fully mature leafyelm trees that dominated the area, obscuring any views. I oriented myself to thetunnel exit where Gary claimed to have seen the two “sinister cars.” Fourhundred meters farther west, it was impossible to see from Cours Albert or RueJean Goujon. I spent the better part of the day treading the pavements, up anddown the maze of one-way streets, dead ends, and narrow laneways, knocking ondoors and reacquainting myself with French smiles.Having endured repeated small talk on my trusty subject, French and Australianrugby, by late afternoon I was rewarded. At the sixth accommodation facility Ihad visited, after the sixth guest register I had checked page by page, I foundone “G. Hunter” listed toward the back of that belonging to the Royal AlmaHotel. A smallish establishment, it was situated around the corner from Place dl’Alma, 300 yards farther up the one-way street of Rue Jean Goujon. Thereceptionist was kind enough to confirm Mr. Hunter’s attendance for the weekendof August 30 and 31, and offered to show me the room he occupied—room 304 on thethird level. Gary’s room faced the street and overlooked a tall and impressivepost–art deco apartment block immediately across the road. A quick tour of theinterior indicated that none of the hotel rooms offered any views, in anydirection.However, to give Gary the benefit of the doubt, had he leaned himselfprecariously out of his tiny window and looked sharply down the street he mighthave been able to catch just a glimpse, in the midnight darkness, of a clump ofelm trees that surrounded a small public garden. Beyond that, if the trees werecut down, and massive spotlights lit up the distance, there might have been aslim chance of seeing a fraction of the roadway that travels past the Place del’Alma and over the River Seine. Certainly there was no possibility of seeinganything to do with the tunnel or immediate surrounds. As for seeing peoplerunning, in any direction, to or from the tunnel, that too was a completeimpossibility. As for having any view of either end of the tunnel or for seeingtwo cars roaring out of the tunnel exit, the story was a complete fabrication.It would be highly unlikely with the distance involved, for Gary to have evenheard the accident from his room. His statement just didn’t stack up.Again I asked myself why. Why did someone invent such a story? Why did thisLondon lawyer construct a vivid set of observations and hand his statement tothe Al-Fayed family lawyers? And, more importantly, who was really behind it,trying to sully the water and trying to promote terrorism as the motive behindthe death of Princess Diana?CHAPTER TENEven though Colin had systematically debunked Garry Hunter’s story, a campaignof misinformation—or, dare we suggest, fake news—was being spread into thelandscape that surrounded the death of Princess Diana. Someone who wanted tocreate a smoke screen, away from the simple question of how the world’s mostprominent woman could be killed in a car accident with a driver traveling atbreakneck speed and riddled with drugs and alcohol? And, more troubling, thequestion yelled out to be answered: Who employed the driver and came up withthis deeply flawed plan?There is no doubt that Princess Diana was being spied upon by both British andAmerican agents at the time of her death. Her increasingly controversial publicprofile, and her relationship with Dodi, meant that she was being tailed by bothCIA and MI6 officers—up to and including at the moment her tragic life ended.“The British government and the royal family were worried about Dodi,” oneformer intelligence agent who spoke under conditions of strictestconfidentiality confirmed. “They had painted a sinister picture of Dodi as beinga drug user, a serial philanderer, and a highly unreliable figure. There hadbeen talk in those final weeks that Diana was thinking of getting married toDodi. That set alarm bells ringing at Buckingham Palace. It was unthinkable thatsuch an inappropriate figure should become stepfather to the future king, PrinceWilliam. Plus, he was a Muslim. If Diana had children by him, they would have tobe raised in that faith, which could cause huge embarrassment to the Britishroyals.”Dodi’s reputation took a hammering when it was revealed he had been thrown offthe set of the film Chariots Of Fire, on which he had a nominal role as anexecutive producer—thanks to his billionaire father—after it was discovered hehad been handing out cocaine to the cast and crew on set.“Dodi had other things on his mind than developing a film career for himself, ofwhich girls and drugs rated pretty highly—and not necessarily in that order,”producer David Puttnam has observed.If Dodi’s inappropriateness as a mate for the princess of Wales was of concernto the British, it was Diana’s outspoken attacks on the arms industry thatworried the Americans, and brought her under observation by the CIA and others.“She had already successfully rallied public opinion against the use ofantipersonnel land mines—to the extent she persuaded British Prime Minister TonyBlair they should be banned,” an intelligence source mused. “Now she was pushingfor President Clinton to follow suit. The American arms industry was becominghugely concerned about the way she was swinging public opinion, and wanted toknow what her next moves were going to be. If Clinton agreed, then what next?This is an all-powerful, multibillion-dollar industry yet, weirdly, it saw asits chief enemy that pretty blonde princess.”So, two countries were focusing their spying efforts on the princess and herplayboy. The two intelligence agencies, CIA and MI6, were probably pooling theirinformation. Colluding against her. And Diana knew she was being listenedto—constantly ordering sweeps of her private quarters in the years before herdeath.She also harbored suspicions she might die as a result of a car accident and hadrevealed these suspicions in a letter—as we have established—to her butler, PaulBurrell, as well as to her solicitor, Lord Victor Mishcon.For example, in a letter written ten months before the accident in thetunnel—and divulged years later by former butler Burrell—the princess wrote that“this particular phase of my life is the most dangerous.”As Burrell himself tells us:She was often careful about her car. She said to me, “Get underneath and see ifyou can see anything. Is there a pipe cut where the brake fluid goes in?” Isaid, “Your Royal Highness, I’m not an engineer. I don’t know these things.”“Well, have a look. Is there anything unusual underneath the car?” So, I’dscramble underneath the car in my uniform, or my suit, and try and findsomething which looked out of place.Of course, I never did, but she was convinced that the system was out to gether. She wrote me a letter one night. She sat at her desk often late at nightand wrote me notes. This letter goes on for ten pages, and part of it reads,“This is the most difficult part of my life. I fear that Charles is going toorganize an accident in my car. I am going to die of head injuries, and bekilled in order that he can marry Camilla.”In the same note, she painted Charles as a murderous fiend who not only wantedher, but also his own mistress—Camilla Parker Bowles—out of the way so he couldmarry another woman: nanny to princes William and Harry, Tiggy Legge-Bourke.Meanwhile, the royals circulated stories that Diana was delusional and haddeveloped a mental illness.“Charles, Philip, and senior bureaucrats spread stories that she was crazy,” onepalace aide told our investigation, speaking on the condition of anonymity.“They were always pushing the line that Diana had a screw loose and no oneshould listen to her.”It should be observed that this would also suit the interests of the nations andarms dealers who felt threatened by Diana’s crusading.Investigator Noel Botham, author of the book The Murder Of Princess Diana,claims another reason Diana was marked for assassination was that she had anaffair with a relative of Prince Charles in 1991, which was documented in aseries of passionate love letters.It’s said the fling lasted six months and began on a skiing vacation in Austria.Some thirteen letters total between the two were discovered, Botham said, atleast one of which begins, “My darling Diana.”These sort of pressures—from within and without, from royals and fromgovernments—found their culmination in Diana’s so-called accident. It is easyfor contemporary readers to wonder how the suspicious death of a woman soobviously embroiled in romance and political intrigue was taken at face valueback in 1997. Yet it is also easy, in hindsight, to forget how gradually thesetruths came to light.As each year since Diana’s death has passed, more information has been leaked tothe public and to journalists. At first, many of these tawdry truths seemedsimply no more than that: isolated incidents of indiscretion. Yet as themagnitude of the web has been revealed, the sinister interrelations between therevealed secrets have become bracingly clear.Investigative journalist and former BBC royal correspondent Michael D. Cole—inan exclusive interview for this investigation—shares that he also believes therewere sinister forces behind Diana’s death, and that the princess herself hadsome inkling of what was coming…and thought that Prince Charles would beinvolved.I personally think that there is much more to be found out about this. It wasnot an accident. It was a profound tragedy. It lives with me every day. It is myfondest hope, before I die, that the full truth of this will come out, because Idon’t believe it has yet.Princess Diana herself believed strongly that she was going to be murdered, andshe predicted how she would be murdered. She said that she would be murdered ina car crash, orchestrated to look like an accident, and she very firmly blamedher husband for being behind that plot.Perhaps, no single person has done more to bring the truth out into the openthan Dodi’s father, Mohamed Al-Fayed, who has poured an estimated $14 millioninto investigating 175 separate conspiracy theories surrounding Diana and hisson’s death.He has no doubt that the royal family were one of the parties involved inplotting the deaths to prevent Diana from marrying a Muslim. More specifically,he blames Prince Philip and Prince Charles. He is desperate to prove what hethinks is the truth before Philip dies.Mohamed Al-Fayed isn’t the only one to smell a rat.Conspiracy theories about the crash have grown in credibility and urgency in theyears since the crash.One place where many investigators start is the timing. Incredibly, it took astaggering total of 101 minutes to get Diana to the hospital after the initialemergency call. Mohamed Al-Fayed believes British secret service agents hadinfiltrated the paramedic crew and purposefully delayed the ambulance to slashher chances of survival.President Ronald Reagan suffered the same pulmonary tear as Diana in theassassination attempt against him in 1981—yet he was saved and lived until age93.Suspicion surrounds the accident itself and also the vehicles involved in it.That’s vehicles, plural. For example, the mysterious white Fiat Uno thatnumerous witnesses say sped into the tunnel after the dark blue Mercedes andbumped it from behind, causing the fatal wreck. Investigators found paint andplastic in the wreckage that matched an Uno owned by Jean-Pierre Andanson, aFrench photojournalist supposedly chasing the princess. After police bizarrelyruled the Uno out of playing any part in the crash, the story took anotherunexplained twist when Andanson’s burned remains were found in his locked BMW inthe South of France three years later. There was a rumor that Andanson hadboasted of working for both British and French intelligence services, usingphotography as his cover.In Princess Diana: The Evidence, authors Jon King and John Beveridge assert thatwhen Andanson’s corpse was found, his head was detached from his body and he hada hole in his temple—wounds almost impossible to be caused in a suicide. A monthlater, armed men stole laptops and cameras from the French photo agency thatrepresented Andanson, but detectives still ruled the death a suicide and deniedany link to the break-in. Rumors persisted that Andanson was a shady operativein the murky world of espionage. At the very least, we know that he was someonewhom powerful forces wanted destroyed.“Many people think he was a liability who had to be taken out,” one source closeto the investigation revealed.There are also lingering conspiratorial questions about the condition of thedriver Henri Paul, and if the blood samples taken from him were tampered with.Some experts claim the samples contained such high levels of carbon monoxidethat Paul wouldn’t have been able to walk, let alone drive a car.Diana and Dodi were forced to abandon their usual chauffeur and travel in areplacement vehicle driven by Paul that night, ostensibly for security reasons.But experts suggest that the limo was deliberately sabotaged, and thereplacement vehicle was rigged for the fatal crash.And a further complication—how did Paul come to have nearly $340,000 in his bankaccounts despite being on a $30,000-a-year salary?Some of his old friends claim he was a clandestine operative for the Directionde la Surveillance du Territoire, France’s equivalent of MI5, paid to snoop onfamous guests at the Ritz hotel.A British probe led by former Scotland Yard Police Commissioner Lord Stevensdismissed these conspiracy theories, pinning the blame firmly—and solely—on theboozed-up chauffeur. At the belated 2007 inquest, a jury ruled the cause ofDiana’s death to be the grossly negligent driving of Henri Paul and thefollowing paparazzi.The 832-page document published after the Metropolitan Police investigatedscores of conspiracy theories surrounding Diana’s death discounted all of them.Still, there remains a strong suspicion that Diana was a victim of ameticulously planned murder.The British documentary, Diana: Story of a Princess, screened after theprincess’s death, underlined just how hated she was by shadowy senior advisersto the royal family known as “the gray suits.”The monarchy has an ancient bloody history of beheadings, incarcerations, and alitany of cruel and ruthless punishments meted out to anyone posing theslightest threat to the crown. Diana, with her beauty, her effervescentpersonality, and her enormous public popularity, was perhaps more a threat tothe old order at Buckingham Palace than any other figure in modern times. Forthat reason alone, the crash at the Pont de l’Alma tunnel is suspicious.And just look at the way the royal family treated her. They cast her aside afterher divorce to Charles, and, as her former royal protection officer Ken Wharfeput it, the queen “signed Diana’s death warrant” by failing to persuade her tokeep on her Scotland Yard bodyguards instead of relying on Dodi’s calamitoussecurity detail.There’s no denying that the royals snared naive seventeen-year-old Diana FrancesSpencer to be Prince Charles’s virgin bride and bear his children. But when sheturned out to be a rebel strong enough to stand up to them, there is strongevidence to suggest she became a sacrificial lamb, finally meeting her deathaccordingly in a Paris tunnel.“Princess Diana was the victim of an arranged marriage,” says HaroldBrooks-Baker, one of the world’s leading authorities on royalty and publisher ofthe famed aristocrats’ bible, Burke’s Peerage. “She was a seventeen-year-oldchild pushed into the arms of Prince Charles. What starry-eyed girl would refusea marriage proposal from a dashing prince? But the shadowy powers behind thethrone failed to manipulate their beautiful palace puppet and eventually droveher to her death. They have blood on their hands. Charles should not becomeking. He should hand the throne over to his eldest son, Prince William.”Clearly, these royals were not a group to tolerate transgressions. They expectedobedience, and they expected Diana to bear the children of Prince Charles. So,what, then, of the ultimate disobedience? What of Mohamed Al-Fayed’s claim thatDiana was pregnant with her Muslim lover Dodi’s baby when she died?It’s an explosive idea. Yet, explosive or not, there is copious evidence tosuggest it is true.Consider firstly the images of the two published earlier that year. Her headresting lightly on his bronzed shoulder—Diana’s supple, tanned body relaxed inhis tender embrace; the pictures of two lovers resting on the deck of a luxuryyacht after an afternoon frolic in the warm waters of the Mediterranean shockedthe world.Diana’s face is etched with a deep, satisfied glow, basking contentedly in thearms of new love Dodi. Free of her royal shackles, the playful princess huggedher lover after unleashing a wave of passion for her Egyptian playboy.“I am yours forever—you have changed my life,” lipreaders confirm that Dianawhispered to Dodi as one of the snaps was taken of their lips parting after along, passionate kiss.Dodi is seen in these images hugging the beautiful royal, locking his sun-kissedarms around her waist and striking her shapely bottom.“I can’t believe this is happening to us,” sources say he said when the imageswere captured. “You are the woman I always dreamed would be mine someday.”They embraced on the deck of the yacht Jonikal moored off the island ofSardinia—oblivious to the watching world around them.The lovers held hands and let the shimmering warmth of the Mediterranean enfoldthem as Italian photographer Mario Brenna captured the magical sense of romancethat had the whole world talking in 1997—when the snaps were released. Insiderssaid at the time the perfectly captured Diana deliriously in love.Veteran royal-watcher and editor of Majesty Magazine Ingrid Seward explains whyDiana was so comfortable with Dodi:I think he was just someone that Diana could really enjoy herself with. Thewhole affair with Hasnat Khan was conducted in the utmost secrecy, but Dodi wasglamorous and fun, and I think she was enjoying herself. I think it was assimple as that. It was in the open, and I think she was literally enjoyingherself.Diana was a woman caught up in a whirlwind of passion as she and Dodi slid intoblue waters for a swim, and she wrapped her long, slender legs around hersweetheart beneath the lapping waves. Surrounded by holidaymakers, who didn’trecognize the couple, they were free to frolic like lovestruck teens.Mario said of the images, “They show a princess truly in love. I’m sure theyknew I was taking photos, but they didn’t care. They were so in love they wantedthe world to know.”On the deck of the Jonikal, the couple were seen slowly massaging each otherwith sun lotion. At one point, Dodi eased down the straps of Diana’s swimsuit sohe could rub cream into her shoulders.The pair smooched, kissed, embraced—and in one tender moment, Dodi lovinglyslipped a bracelet over Diana’s wrist as she chatted on her mobile phone. Hisexcitement with his new love even boiled over into unbridled passion as hefollowed her on the yacht—with his arousal showing through his shorts. At thetime, media outlets were forced to censor those shots.A royal source said at the time of the snaps taken in August 1997, “That cruisesealed their love. The photos show Diana is free from her emotional prison.She’s boasting a new, unfettered sexuality. You can see the gleam in her eyes.And her figure has taken on a rounder, more voluptuous shape.”The magical six-day trip started on July 27 on the luxury love boat from Nice,France, to the crystal-clear waters surrounding the fabled islands of Corsicaand Sardinia. The Jonikal was manned by a staff of sixteen, sailed by Bonifacio,Corsica, and anchored off the wealthy resort town of Porto Cervi, off Sardinia’sEmerald Coast. The lovers stayed onboard all the next day. They ordered a pastadinner from Pedrinelli’s restaurant, delivered by boat.The Jonikal then headed to Cavallo, where Princess Caroline of Monaco hadvacationed the week before. In Dodi, Diana had finally found the man whounleashed her pent-up sexual frustration after her tortured years with PrinceCharles.Dr. Lois Mueller, the renowned clinical psychologist from Tampa, Florida, whostudied the couple’s body language when the images were printed, declared thatin her professional estimation:Dodi is the ideal lover for Princess Diana. She fell in love with the power andpassion of a Middle Eastern man.”Just like her lover before Dodi—Pakistani heart doctor Hasnat Khan—Diana foundher new Egyptian lover captivating. Middle Eastern men are known for theirsexual prowess and energy. Dodi has that exotic passion and love of women thatcomes from his culture.And after Diana’s painful, sexless marriage to cold Charles, the reboundingroyal doubtless delighted in the attention and appreciation of Dodi.“Dodi is also younger and better looking than Charles,” added the shrink,speaking more informally and abruptly.Dodi also loved Diana’s plumper body as she packed on fifteen pounds after herbreakup with Hasnat, and increased her curves—leading Dr. Mueller to furthercomment, “Middle Eastern men love their women well rounded.”Whether the double meaning is intended there, is, truly, anybody’s guess.Despite Diana and Dodi being so obviously in love, there may have been amotivation for allowing the photos to be taken above and beyond wanting a publiccelebration of their feelings for one another. Insiders have claimed shepurposefully posed for the photos to infuriate Charles.“Dodi set out to woo a woman who was trying to get over a lost love—and hesucceeded,” a source revealed at the time. The pair moved in similar circles andhad seen each other at polo events and film premieres in London’s West End.However, it wasn’t until July 1997 that Diana and Dodi started a relationshipduring their luxury summer break in the south of France. Diana was still reelingfrom her split from the surgeon Hasnat when she accepted Mohamed Al-Fayed’sinvitation to stay at his palatial villa in Saint-Tropez with William, fifteen,and Harry, twelve. It was there Diana started to see a different side to Dodiand realized he had the makings of a dream stepfather for William and Harry.“Dodi was a real charmer, and William and Harry took to him at once,” an insidernoted in a well-documented 1997 tell-all. “He went swimming with them, playedgames with them, and laughed at their jokes and pranks. Diana saw another sideto the smooth playboy, and they started talking intimately for hours, goingdancing, and then became inseparable.”Dodi’s dad had been a friend of Diana’s father, the late Earl Spencer. Diana’sstepmother, Raine, the Countess of Chambrun, sat on the Harrods InternationalBoard. Throughout the summer of 1997, a carefree Diana loved being showered withgifts and affection by Dodi. And once the pictures started to spread around theworld, Diana was, according to friends, relaxed about the publicity over her newrelationship.A source quoted at the time revealed, “Diana told friends: ‘It’s the best sexI’ve ever had.’”They added about her plan to use the photographs as a parting shot to Charles:This was Diana’s revenge. This was the woman who might have been queen ofEngland revealing a new love from a foreign family with huge wealth and none ofthe royals’ restrictions.The royals thought they had gotten rid of her. But she came back on top and wasthreatening to start her own kind of royal dynasty with the tremendous wealthand power of the Fayeds behind her.Every publication in the world wanted to print these sizzling snaps of Diana andmillionaire boyfriend Dodi passionately playing in the Med. But the Globescooped them, forking out a reputed $210,000. It was a huge payday forphotographer Mario Brenna, who was said to have made up to $3 million worldwidewith the pictures.He usually did fashion shoots, but when he spotted Dodi’s yacht sailing betweenthe islands of Sardinia and Corsica, curiosity made him take a second look.“I’d seen the yacht in my home base of Monaco just two weeks earlier,” he said.“Diana was on board then with the Al-Fayed family so I thought, ‘Maybe she’sback.’ Sure enough she was—alone with Dodi. I couldn’t believe my eyes. Theywere all over each other. They kissed for 10 seconds and after that her headwent back. It was almost like she was putting on a show for the camera. I don’tknow if she saw me, but I made no attempt to hide. She looked so happy.”In addition to their celebrated nautical romp, there is also evidence of theirstrong affections—and the royals’ disapproval of it—that comes from a verydifferent source. Namely, a dog breeder.Dodi was planning to give Diana a schnauzer pup named Juliet—believed to havebeen a gift to celebrate the conception of his child with the royal. Dog breederMarlene McNeill, who supplied the touching gift, said, “He wanted the new puppyto grow into a living, growing symbol of his love for Diana. It was a wonderful,romantic gesture for the princess. It’s utterly tragic that she never got toreceive the little puppy that was being bred for her as a gift of love.”Marlene was fifty-four when Dodi ordered the dog for $950 from her Tassajarakennels near Portland, Oregon—and swore her to secrecy about the gift.“He wanted it to be a big surprise,” said Marlene.Dodi chose the dog as Diana loved his giant schnauzer Romeo, also sold to theplayboy by Marlene in 1991.She said he wanted Diana to name the dog Juliet so their dogs could be just likethe lovers in Shakespeare’s play.But we see the dog was not only a romantic gift.A source close to Mohamed Al-Fayed said, “It was thought the gift was going tobe handed to Diana as her pregnancy developed. Al-Fayed was convinced Diana waspregnant, and the dog was going to be like ‘training’ for her ahead of the newarrival—something to cuddle that would then be replaced by her and Dodi’s baby.”Dog breeders are one thing, but what about someone with a medical degree?Dr. Richard Shepherd—who reexamined Diana’s body for the official inquiry intoher death—has also raised questions about whether she was pregnant.He left the issue hanging when he admitted Diana could just have become awareshe had conceived shortly before her death.At the time, Dr. Shepherd said, “Pathologically there was no evidence thatPrincess Diana was pregnant, but some women say they know they’re pregnant fromthe moment of conception. Was she one of those?”Others believe Diana’s pregnancy was far more advanced when she died—with thechild being the reason she was assassinated.For example, in The Princess Diana Conspiracy, author Alan Power said that Dianawas between six and ten weeks pregnant, and the fetus was “clearly visible” bystaff at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, where Diana was taken after the crash.What’s more, both radiologist Dr. Elizabeth Dion and nurse Jocelyn Magellanclaimed they saw a fetus in Diana’s womb. There is some controversy surroundingthe question of whether or not a fetus can be accurately identified by the nakedeye at such an early stage. However, Dion and Magellan were both experiencedmedical professionals. Furthermore, it’s true that a fetus of six to ten weekswould be very small, but it would not be impossible to identify—especially ifyou were a healthcare practitioners who knew what you were looking for.Dr. Dion told friends that her evidence was “incontrovertible”—or undeniable—butshe was never called to testify about it in court, according to author Power.“It was most definitely Dodi’s child and this was most definitely one of themotives for murder,” wrote Power.He added that the pregnancy also “explained Diana’s illegal and speedyembalming” after the crash so tests to confirm a pregnancy could not beperformed.Meanwhile, the French police officer, who did not want to be named, said theauthorities conspired to cover up the fact that the princess was expectingDodi’s child in order to spare embarrassment to her family.The fact Diana’s shattered body was embalmed just hours after her tragic deathis thought to be the most striking piece of evidence to prove that she waspregnant. That question remains unanswered to this day.Jean Monceau, who did this embalming, says it was performed to prevent the bodyfrom deteriorating so it would be “presentable” to Prince Charles and otherfamily members who were on their way to Paris.But countless crime experts, investigators, family, friends, and hospitalpersonnel where Diana died believe dark forces within the palace wantedembalming to cover up the fact of her pregnancy at all costs.Alarmingly, other witnesses at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital say the princess waspregnant but miscarried the baby as she lay clinging to life during her finalmoments on Earth.“I was told that Diana was enceinte (‘pregnant’ in French) but had lost thebaby,” confirmed one nurse at the hospital. “That was even before the newscirculated that Diana had not made it. People who heard of her death wereweeping, not only over losing such a beautiful person, but because it happenedwhen she was pregnant.”As if protesting suspiciously too much, within hours of her death, hospitalauthorities began taking unprecedented measures to squelch word that Diana waswith child.It is said that senior hospital bureaucrat and high official from the Frenchministry of health quickly called together the doctors and nurses who’d attendedto the dying princess and told them that to protect her privacy, her pregnancywas not to be mentioned to anyone.“A phony story was then circulated that there had been no miscarriage—that ithad all been a mistake due to confusion surrounding her blood loss,” reveals ahospital source.The cover-up is said to have been orchestrated by a top government diplomat,under direct orders from senior palace officials.“It’s believed that during this process, all remaining indications of thepregnancy were removed,” said one well-placed investigator. “It’s likely thatthe strong chemicals used in the embalming process disguised the bodily changesthat would have shown a pregnancy.”It wasn’t until after Diana’s body was flown to back to London that an autopsywas finally performed by royal coroner Dr. John Burton. He claims there was nosign of a pregnancy, but that was no surprise to medical experts who insist thatthe miscarriage and embalming would have removed all evidence. But the cover-upcouldn’t silence friends of Diana, who were in on the joyous news that she wasindeed expecting a child—and had suspected it was a baby girl.“It’s almost beyond belief that her life was snuffed out so brutally at themoment of her greatest happiness,” says a family friend. “She longed for a babygirl. It was a profound wish she kept deep in her heart. She felt somethingwithin that was different from her previous pregnancies, and when a psychicfriend of hers told her she was pregnant with a girl, she was sure.”Diana had just spent six idyllic days cruising around the Mediterranean withDodi, and a telltale photo taken during this last vacation clearly shows theslender princess sporting a baby bump while walking along a beach in a bathingsuit.“She was blissfully happy,” recalls the family source. “Her little bump wasshowing, and she was so proud. She’d even told reporters that she had some happynews to report.”Pregnancy claims were also brought up during the 2007 inquest into Diana’sdeath.Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital anesthesiology professor Bruno Riou and cardiacsurgery professor Alain Pavie were both asked about speculation that hospitalstaff claimed they saw signs of a pregnancy during an ultrasound scan of Diana’sabdomen. If true, it would support contentions made by Mohamed Al-Fayed that hisson—and the beloved princess—were murdered to cover up their impending child.Royalists, including friends of Prince Charles, have strenuously refuted claimsthat Diana was pregnant at the time of her death.But a palace insider claimed the princess’s condition was hushed up at therequest of senior royals—just as other conspiratorial signs that would claim shewas murdered were also hidden from the world.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------DETECTIVE’S NOTEBOOKDATELINE: Week three of my investigation, September 1997The last thing I felt like doing was making more inquiries around the Place del’Alma. I was certain that during the last two weeks virtually every immediateresident had heard my pro forma introduction and my half a dozen standardquestions. There was simply nothing more there to glean. I was up for a strollalong the Seine and a good read of anything but the newspapers on the death ofPrincess Diana. I grabbed the only novel I had taken with me in my travel kit, abook I had thus far ignored, and went in search of breakfast.Despite my good intentions, I found myself unconsciously pacing upstreamalongside Paris’s great waterway and by lunchtime I was almost adjacent to thetunnel entrance. Out of habit I resumed my favorite position on the cappingbeside the roses and turned to page one of my reading material. John Grisham’sThe Runaway Jury was not a runaway success with my mood. I tossed it aside andrefocused on the three words that were dominating the airwaves and were nowcircling endlessly in my brain, “the second car.” Where was it? But moreimportantly, where was its driver? I was fascinated that in a month since theaccident the driver had neither been located nor come forward. In an attempt tounderstand a serious incident such as the crashing of the Mercedes-Benz adetective will often sit alone at the crime scene with a head full of facts anda hungry mind, looking for answers. It works. Somehow it gets you closer to theunraveling than sitting on a swivel-less swivel chair at an overladen desk in atired squad room.So as I adopted this approach, staring almost absentmindedly in front of me, myeyes cast downward to the road surface. I noticed that the tire markings werefading quickly and again felt thankful that I had taken my notations when I did,as it would be fraught with danger to attempt any measurements at this point. Ilooked over at the merge lane and imagined the little Fiat Uno slowly motoringalong the service way behind the close-knit avenue of trees that obscured theview of the main highway. My head flicked to the right and I pictured theMercedes-Benz hurtling toward the tunnel at that exact same millisecond. TheFiat’s brush with the juggernaut was unavoidable; the driver could not havetaken any preventative action as the Mercedes was simply traveling too fast.Similarly, Princess Diana’s chauffeur would not have expected the little Fiat todawdle out onto the highway in front of him, hence the skid marks from HenriPaul’s desperate attempt to avoid their imminent collision. I was under nodoubts that the presence on the carriageway of the second car had played a partin the chain of events that led up to the tragic accident. However, I had cometo the realization that the driver of the Fiat Uno, whoever it may be, was notat fault. But then why was he missing? What was his mind-set?The shock that an innocent party would experience, having been involved in whatmay have appeared to them to be a minor collision, only to hear in subsequenthours of the resultant deaths of three people, would normally have them seekingcounselling, wanting to talk with someone—and soon. To suspect that they mayhave had a hand in the death of the princess of Wales would add to their burdenexponentially. They would be reminded of such sadness and horror every minute ofthe day through the saturation of the world’s media, workplace chatter, andneighborly gossip. The whole world was on to it; it was too much for any oneperson to handle. Grief would be followed by depression, whether it wasaccidental death or otherwise. For those reasons I found it even harder toaccept that there might have been passengers in the Fiat Uno. I concluded that Iwas looking for a lone driver. But our driver was going against the archetype ofthose involved in a fatal accident. He or she had gone to ground. I asked myselfwhy would a citizen unquestionably innocent of any wrongdoing disappear likethis, and more importantly, how would they? And where was their car? Paris wasnot a city of garages; almost all vehicles were parked on the street. A Fiat wasa common sight; any number could sit out the front of someone’s house orapartment block and be completely inconspicuous, except this vehicle was nowseriously dented from its collision with the Mercedes and its impact with theretaining wall. It could no longer park unnoticed; it could no longer be ananonymous common car. So where was the nearly ruined white Fiat when millions ofeyes were looking for it, talking about it? This puzzling issue was working itsway through me as the traffic buzzed by. Occasionally a mourner would amble fromthe overpass to sit beside me on the retaining wall. After a few moments ofmutual silence I would repeatedly face the ridiculously obvious query, “Did youlike Princess Diana?”Frustrated that my two most troubling questions remained unanswered, I wanderedoff despondently. As I strolled toward the eastern gate of the Brazilianembassy, I was halted by the sound of the massive security doors swinging open.The engine of a little transporter had just come to life and I watched as itslowly exited the embassy grounds. On the back of its tray was a smallcontainer, no larger than a sofa, just the sort of thing an ambassadorial officewould use to ship home documents or old furnishings or any other unwantedrubbish. Diplomatic immunity guaranteed unhampered transportation of literallyanything. My heart raced with a new possibility. I imagined a bigger container,one that would fit a small motorcar. Nothing too difficult there; containerscome in all shapes and sizes up to forty feet long. How easy to be free of anyinvolvement in the death of the princess of Wales, however innocent. Justsecrete the Fiat Uno in a diplomatic shipping container and toss it out with therubbish. I stared at the rear of the transporter as it rumbled toward the mergelane, its brake lights flashing momentarily before it nudged forward, found agap in the traffic, and disappeared onto the main carriageway on its way to thetunnel.One missing car, one missing driver, three dead, and a mangled Mercedes.It was then that I knew it was time to go home. As I walked briskly back to myhotel, I had a sense that the car would never be found, nor the driver. And thefarther I walked, the more sure I was that he or she was long gone. I felt a lotlike a man who has just placed the last piece of a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. Butit didn’t fit properly. My diplomatic hunch didn’t feel right."},{"pageContent":"--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Within forty-eight hours I had packed up my room, said goodbye to Charles, andeaten my last meal at my regular dining table. It was time to leave behind arose garden, tire residue, a tunnel entrance, and a fractured thirteenth pillar.I felt a sense of relief that my work in France was complete; there was no needto stay any longer. Soon I was seated on an Air France jet with my head in afamiliar waft of Gauloises cigarettes, my bout of Sherlock Holmes escapism over.I was heading back to the office; as my detective self used to say, once upon atime, “time to go home.” And besides, I was starting to get very tired of thesame clothes I had suffered for the past three weeks.As I pressed the recliner button on my economy class seat, lowered theair-conditioning control, and snapped the top off my first airline gin andtonic, I recalled my initial impression of the now infamous French tunnel. Likemany of the crime scenes I had visited, there was nothing remarkable to lure thecurious to the location, nothing to tell of a tragedy of insurmountableproportions. There was just a mess of civil engineering, asphalt, and concretecapping in an otherwise non-descript roadway in the middle of a very big citywhere people came and went in too much of a hurry.With my head and mood now in the clouds and onto my second gin, my mind driftedto an equally infamous location and another tragedy that had stopped the worldin its tracks. Back several decades and across a continent to Elm Grove belowthe Texas Book Depository and the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy. Ireasoned that history’s pages may also group these accident scenes, crimescenes, call them what you will. The thirty-fifth US president’s lastmoments—like Princess Diana’s—were as a passenger in a chauffeured vehicle.Another tunnel, another overpass, another inconsequential stretch ofmotorway…it’s funny how a handsome president and a beautiful princess had foundequality in death.However, the Holy Grail of investigative enigmas, for all the similarities, wasmanaged very differently by its local police. The Texans swarmed over the arealike an army of excitable uniforms and overwhelmed suits, bumbling their way tothe facts. In France they played with a different deck of cards. None of thegendarmes appeared to give a damn, the investigative magistrates were missing,and in my three weeks at Claude’s rose garden not once did I see a uniform, asuit, or a forensic outfit. I was glad to be done and dusted.CHAPTER ELEVENSex was central to Diana’s death—and not only her own sex life.Put bluntly, some sources have wildly claimed there was evidence that Dianacould have been killed to cover up the seedy sex secrets of the royals—includingthe truth of Prince Charles’s sexuality and a shocking gay rape involving theroyal.For this is the shocking belief of informants who say Diana quietly made arecord of her knowledge of scandals that could finish Britain’s monarchy on tennever-before-seen videocassette tapes and a series of audiocassettes, andstashed them in a box called the “Crown Jewels,” under lock and key in herKensington Palace apartment. (A signet ring belonging to Diana’s lover JamesHewitt was also reputedly in the box.) She is also believed to have stashedphotographs that show Prince Charles romping naked with a male lover.As far-fetched as it sounds, the claims were central to the 2008 inquest intoher death when her sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, strenuously denied shedestroyed the box of secrets. Instead, Lady Sarah insisted she gave them to PaulBurrell for safekeeping, adding pointedly, “I trusted him, then.”The princess’s former butler maintains, however, that the papers were taken tothe Spencer family seat at Althorp, where they are hidden.Richard Keen QC, counsel for the family of driver Henri Paul, asked Lady Sarahat the inquest, “You opened Pandora’s box. Once Pandora’s box was opened, allthe evils of the world came out and you claim that you gave them to the butler;is that right?“Are you seriously saying that you took all of these sensitive materials withtheir obvious capacity to embarrass and cause distress…and handed them over tothe butler?”The answer was a terse, “Yes.”Lady Sarah, who was an executor of Diana’s estate, confirmed that in March1998—six months after her sister died in the Paris crash—she and Burrell foundthe key to the mahogany box hidden inside the cover of a tennis racket. They satdown together to go through it. Its contents were “highly sensitive,” she said,and, as she was traveling home to Lincolnshire by train, she gave them toBurrell for “safekeeping.”She said she subsequently asked Burrell “two or three times” for the return ofthe papers but was given various excuses, including that they were stored inpacking cases at his Cheshire residence.“I asked Paul Burrell to take it home, the evening we opened the box, forsafekeeping and he did and that’s the last I ever saw of it despite asking himto give it back to me on several occasions,” she told the inquest.Were these recordings compiled intentionally, perhaps as a defense againstreprisals the royal family might have been tempted to take based on Diana’sother misbehavior? Or did they fall into her hands unexpectedly? Did Charlesleave them where Diana could find them, as part of some personal indiscretion?However they may have come to her, the recordings and images that wouldpotentially shatter the Windsors were squirreled away by Diana in a spot inKensington Palace known only to Burrell.Diana’s videos had been recorded by her voice coach Peter Settelen.Only six of the videos were used in the famous bombshell Channel 4 documentary,but the remaining ten have never been seen. Diana also recorded her mostintimate secrets on twelve C90 cassette tapes, we can also reveal for this book.When Burrell collected hundreds of Diana’s possessions in the wake of her death,the secret stash of recordings and photographs were among the 342 items he tookto the attic of his home near Runcorn near Cheshire, northwest England.That is what police were looking for when they hammered on his door at 6:50 a.m.on January 18, 2001. They were also the reason Paul Burrell’s trial forallegedly stealing the items from Diana never went ahead. As everyone knows, thequeen herself stepped in at the eleventh hour to state she had suddenly recalledgiving Burrell permission to take keepsakes from Diana’s apartment—somethingBurrell had claimed all along. It was only an intervention of this magnitudethat could stop the world hearing the butler reveal exactly was among the itemshe had lifted.Afterward, Burrell was summoned for a three-hour meeting with the queen, duringwhich she chillingly told him “dark forces” were at work and that his life maybe in danger from knowing too much about the royal family. Charles—panicked asupposed bisexual affair would emerge—also battled behind the scenes to have thetrial stopped and Burrell silenced.The man who will be the next King of England is rumored to have kept a string ofboys on the side during his marriages to both Diana and his second wife Camilla.In 2003, the future king was embroiled in another well-documented gay scandalwhen his former manservant George Smith claimed he was raped by a member ofCharles’s staff, Michael Fawcett. Smith—who worked for Charles for eleven years,until 1997—also said Fawcett was in a homosexual relationship with the prince.He also claimed that one morning while delivering breakfast in bed to Charles,he had walked in on the pair having sex in the prince’s bedroom. Charles wasforced to issue a statement on the rape story. It did not name Smith as the manbehind the story, but said the accuser had suffered from post-traumatic stressdisorder and alcoholism after service in the Falklands War. The smear-filledstatement said, “He has, in the past, made other unrelated allegations, whichthe police have fully investigated and found to be unsubstantiated.”Nevertheless, the British tabloids shrieked “SEX, SECRETS, BETRAYAL and SHAME.”The Mail on Sunday splashed on its front page with the ghastly headline “I WASRAPED BY CHARLES’ SERVANT.”This scandal would never have emerged if Diana had not sat at the end of Smith’sbed after he was hospitalized following the alleged rape—and recorded hisdamning attack on Charles, along with other secrets about her husband.Diana took her recorder to Smith’s bedside in 1990 after Charles told his wifethe allegations were “downstairs gossip”—before the footman was given $48,000 asa payoff before he left royal service.Being an old soldier and loyal to the crown, Smith kept quiet about theincident—even when the trauma forced him to enter a psychiatric rehab center andcontributed to the breakup of his marriage. It was while he was in the PrioryClinic that Diana perched on the end of his bed, supposedly to listen to hisproblems. Yet her real motivation was to capture Charles’s most shameful secretson the whirring tape recorder in her handbag.Understanding that knowledge was power, the princess—paranoid even in 1990 abouther safety—kept the tape with her other eleven cassettes containing royalsecrets, locked away. Also among her treasure trove were vicious letters sent toher from her father-in-law, Prince Philip, which have also never been seen. Itwas her stash of secrets that drove the queen and Philip to stop the Burrelltrial. The royal family was said to be “petrified” Burrell would reveal theallegations squirreled away on tape recordings.But their conspiracy did not stop there—insiders believe Diana may have beenkilled to cover up the secrets they never thought would emerge.One aide, who believes Diana was offed (and only spoke on condition of anonymityfor fear of recriminations) said, “There’s one reason Diana was killed—she knewtoo much. The royals knew she had been collecting information on them for years,and wanted her out of the way. They just couldn’t have their trail of affairsand seedy secrets coming out in the open. She was bumped off, and they thoughtthat was the risk removed. What they never betted on was that she had tapedtheir most intimate secrets—and had photographic evidence Charles was gay. Theywere stunned when it emerged they were being kept in Paul Burrell’s attic, anddid everything they could to stop the contents being made public at court.”After Diana’s death, Lady Sarah was asked by the coroner’s inquest to search theSpencer family’s home for a variety of sensitive documents and materials thatcould have included these tapes. The inquest jury had heard claims that Philiphad ordered the killing of Diana, and these claims could not be dismissedoutright. However, neither could they be given credence without proof. The tapesand other sensitive materials were never found. Lady Sarah and a police officerwho had previously investigated Paul Burrell gave conflicting accounts of whathad happened to the secret items. Both Lady Sarah and the police officer were inagreement that the missing items might be inside a wooden box that Diana oftenkept in her sitting room.Yet Lady Sarah claimed that the box had been taken into Burrell’s possession—forat least some period of time—following Diana’s death. Lady Sarah said that shehad looked in the box but found it did not contain any of the sought-afterletters or recordings. She believed that this was because they had already beentaken by Burrell.At the same time, the police officer claimed that Lady Sarah had previouslyclaimed that the material had been in the box, but that a search of Burrell’shome revealed they were not there.Again, Lady Sarah has denied that she destroyed these materials herself.At the time Diana made her “rape tape,” her marriage to the heir was already inits death throes, with Diana repeatedly telling friends she suspected he mayhave only married her in 1981 to cover up his homosexuality.But she also suspected Charles was bisexual, as he also had a disgraceful trackrecord for bedding friends’ wives.Camilla was wed to his friend Brigadier Andrew Parker Bowles, who turned a blindeye to their twenty-two-year affair before they divorced in 1995. The prince ofWales also bedded very-married Lady Kanga Tryon—and cheekily agreed to begodfather to one of her husband’s children.A source for this book said, “There may be hundreds of theories about why Dianacould have been killed, but knowing too much is the real reason.”This idea that Diana “knew too much” emerges as a theme in any study of theprincess’s death. It also begins to suggest the ways in which the “dark forces”that sought to end her once and for all may have found ways to collude.It is now believed the twelve tapes in question have been destroyed. How and bywhom is not precisely known.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Biographer Tom Bower—who has published a book on Mohamed Al-Fayed and PrinceCharles titled Rebel Prince —spoke to many involved in the Burrell theft case.Bower’s research reveals just how the royals stopped the court hearing that mayhave brought down a monarchy.This time line, constructed from Bower’s work, is instructive in understandingthe devastating power with which the crown can punch when it so chooses:January 18, 2001. The doorbell rang at 6:50 in the morning.Paul Burrell, who was asleep, was awakened by his wife.Standing at the door was Detective Chief Inspector Maxine de Brunner and threeother police officers.“Do you have any items from Kensington Palace in this house?” Princess Diana’sformer butler was asked.“No,” he initially lied.He was told he was being placed under arrest, and then the predawn raid on hishome near Runcorn in Cheshire began in earnest.What the detectives found next was far beyond their expectations.The rooms were filled with paintings, drawings, china, and photographs thatclearly belonged to Diana (who’d died three and a half years before) and herchildren William and Harry.“Oh my God,” de Brunner is said to have exclaimed.In Burrell’s study, she’d just spotted an expensive inlaid mahogany deskinscribed “Her Royal Highness.”“How did you get all this?” she asked the butler.“The princess gave it to me,” he said, collapsing into a chair and beginning toweep.As the search continued, the police discovered two thousand negatives.A cursory look revealed Charles in the bath with his children, and many othersshowing the young princes naked.Other finds included thirty signed photographs of Diana, many empty silverframes, a box containing the princess’s daily personal notes to William atschool, and another box of Diana’s more intimate letters to William.As Burrell’s sobs intensified, an officer shouted from the attic, “It’s full ofboxes, wall to wall!”The boxes were wrenched open: inside were bags, blouses, dresses, nightgowns,underwear, shoes, jumpers, suits, and hats that had belonged to Diana, includinga blue-ribboned hat she’d worn during her visit with Prince Charles to SouthKorea in 1992.Her perfume, de Brunner noticed, lingered on the fabric.Late that afternoon, officers filled a truck sent from London with two thousanditems that de Brunner judged had been illegally removed.The princess, she believed, would never have given away such personal material,and certainly not in such quantities.Nevertheless, a large number of Diana’s possessions remained in the house.But without orders from Scotland Yard to either seize everything that hadbelonged to the family or to seal the house as a crime scene, there was no moreto be done.“I want white lilies on my coffin,” wailed Burrell as he was escorted to thewaiting police car.There can be few people unaware of the subsequent 2002 trial of Paul Burrell,but it appears that a great deal went on behind the scenes that was neverrevealed to the public.News of his former employee’s arrest reached Charles about a week after thepolice raid.Unaware of the scale of the alleged theft, but knowing that low-paid staffoccasionally pilfered small items, he told his assistant private secretary MarkBolland that Burrell probably did steal some things “because they all do.”Within hours, however, Charles had become more alarmed. After all, police probesinto murky palace habits could produce unexpected difficulties.Charles’s senior private secretary, Stephen Lamport, looking beaten anddownhearted, confessed to a colleague, “We’ve got a terrible problem with thisman Burrell…the prince of Wales is distraught. The prince will say he gave thethings to the butler and that Burrell’s actions were all right.”Lamport’s confidant was unimpressed. Even Charles had to allow justice to takeits course, came the reply.Indeed, the investigation was now well under way.During his second police interview, Burrell was asked, “Did you tell anyone thatyou had the property?”“No,” he admitted, still insisting that the items—including all Diana’s schoolreports—were gifts.Burrell’s solicitor Andrew Shaw, for his part, appeared to think the case wouldnever come to trial.“You’re making a terrible mistake,” he told Maxine de Brunner. “They won’t letBurrell’s secrets be splashed in the public domain. They’ll never let this cometo trial.”In light of what happened subsequently, his comments were not quite asfarfetched as they first seemed to many who heard them.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------April 3, 2001Along with a crown prosecution lawyer, Maxine de Brunner arrived at St. James’sPalace for a meeting. There was no alternative but to prosecute, they told theroyal family’s senior officials.Also present was Charles’s divorce lawyer, Fiona Shackleton.Shackleton revealed that Paul Burrell had sent the prince a handwritten letterin which he offered to return some of the items, provided Charles agreed not tosupport any prosecution.The CPS lawyer explained that the case could be closed only if Prince Williamand Diana’s sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale, who together inherited Diana’sproperty, signed statements to drop their complaints.Shackleton’s view was that Charles could not be party to undermining the legalsystem.Agreeing to accept the return of some property in exchange for dropping theinvestigation, she said, would make it look as if Buckingham Palace wereparticipating in a cover-up.“It needs to be all or nothing,” she said.Sir Robin Janvrin, the queen’s private secretary, agreed to tell the monarchwhat had been discussed, and almost certainly did so.This, of course, would have been the ideal moment for the queen to recall thatshe’d allowed the butler to take some of Diana’s possessions for safekeeping.But apparently, she didn’t say a word.As for Charles, he was upset when his own private secretary told him the policeintended to prosecute.He could already see the writing on the wall. For who knew what Burrell mightsay in the witness box? In effect, he was a time bomb, having witnessed theprince’s secret meetings and phone calls with Camilla while he was married, andDiana’s many rendezvous with her boyfriends.He told his spin doctor Mark Bolland to try to navigate a way out of aprosecution.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------May 2The case against Burrell strengthened.The police had had time to watch six videos found in Burrell’s home, featuringDiana talking about the most intimate details of her relationship with the royalfamily, her sex life with Charles, and her affair with police protection officerBarry Mannakee. The tapes had been recorded by Peter Settelen, the princess’svoice coach, who, soon after her death, had asked her private secretary for thereturn of not six but sixteen tapes.Yet he was told, “I am advised by Mr. Burrell that he has been unable to tracethem.”What had happened, the police wondered, to the missing ten tapes? (Material fromSettelen’s six recovered tapes was, again, used in a Channel 4 documentary in2017.)And there was another tape that worried Charles…Kept in a box of Diana’s and now, he believed, in Burrell’s possession, itdescribed the alleged rape of one member of his staff by another of his staff.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------July 19Burrell’s lawyers now issued a warning to Shackleton.If Burrell were prosecuted, they said, he would have to describe from thewitness box not only details of Diana’s sex life, he might also read out quotesfrom letters in which Prince Philip had allegedly threatened her.Burrell’s lawyers later explained that this was not a threat—the defense wasseeking only to protect the royal family.At this point, the CPS and the police asked for a “victims’ consultationmeeting” in order to obtain the direct approval of Princes Charles and Williamto prosecute Burrell.In anticipation of a police visit to Highgrove, Charles appealed to Bolland,reportedly saying, “Mark, this is crazy. You must do something.”The prince was now apparently keen to do anything to avert a trial, especiallywith William a potential witness.Burrell simply knew too much. Would he, for instance, dare to describe Diana’sreported use of cocaine to the court? The best way to avoid a prosecution,Bolland agreed, was for Burrell to return all the property he’d taken.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------July 24A top-secret meeting was now arranged between Bolland and Burrell. Over coffee,the butler said, “I’m sorry.”He wanted to let Charles know that he’d return all the property, but insisted ontelling him so in person.Throughout the twenty-five-minute meeting, the spin doctor reported that he hadbeen appalled by Burrell’s “creepy manner.” The royals’ staff, he thought, were“a slimy, weird group with odd relationships.”Later, he reported back to Charles that the butler wanted “a big hug and anoffer of a job at Balmoral. He doesn’t want to be cast out.”The prince repeated the words thoughtfully, “He doesn’t want to be cast out.”A truth occurred to Bolland then about the royals. Something that revealed justwhat was at stake, and hinted at what might be happening behind the scenes.“No one cares whether Burrell is guilty or not.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------August 3The police were expected at Highgrove in the afternoon.What they didn’t know, Bolland hoped, was that secret arrangements had been madefor Prince Charles to meet Burrell a few hours later.But before the police arrived, the spin doctor became suspicious that the planhad been leaked to the police, probably by one of Charles’s own protectionofficers.The meeting with Burrell must be canceled, he advised. Charles agreed.Next, the prince discussed the approach he planned to take with the police.He intended to ask, “Does this really matter? Yes, some items may have beenpilfered, but just how serious is it? Not very.”In the moment, however, Charles didn’t get around to saying any of this.Instead, he was palpably shocked when the police told him two thousand items hadbeen seized at Burrell’s home.It was the first time he’d heard the actual number.“He’s taken the lot!” Charles exclaimed.After listening to more evidence against the butler, the prince was asked if hesupported a prosecution.“We’ve got no alternative,” he sighed. Before leaving, the police asked Charlesnot to have any contact with Burrell.The prince was now in a fix, to say the least. Officially, he had to support theCPS’s charge that Burrell had stolen the items. But, privately, he still wantedthe prosecution halted.Another big sticking point was that Diana’s sister and coexecutor, Lady SarahMcCorquodale, was adamant that the butler should be brought to trial.Meanwhile, the police confronted Bolland to ask if he’d talked to Burrell. Yes,replied the spin doctor.This admission confirmed police suspicions.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------August 18Now, in an attempt to avert prosecution, Burrell’s lawyer handed the police athirty-nine-page statement signed by his client.Among other things, it described the butler’s close relationship with Diana—howhe would smuggle her boyfriends into Kensington Palace, cancel publicengagements so she could be with her lovers, and provide meals for the princessand her man of the moment.In addition, Burrell hinted that he’d tell what he knew about Diana’s nocturnalvisits around Paddington, where she tried to persuade prostitutes to give uptheir trade by plying them with gifts.Even the police could see that if Burrell gave detailed testimony about Diana’ssex life in court, the monarchy would be seriously harmed.Still, there was nothing in the butler’s statement that undermined the charge oftheft. So Burrell was once again interviewed.This time, he claimed that the items found in his house should be seen either asgifts, taken by mistake, or handed over to him to be destroyed. He didn’t offerto return anything.At 2:40 p.m., Burrell was charged with theft.A month later, Burrell’s lawyer wrote to Charles, asking for an audience so hecould explain “the extreme delicacy of the situation” if his client had totestify. This was, obviously, pregnant with meaning.Charles, who’d taken legal advice, did not reply.The lawyer then sent further warnings about Burrell’s intention to speak aboutevents of “extreme delicacy” and “matters of a very private nature.”Again Charles did not reply. This provoked Burrell’s lawyer to threaten tosummon the prince as a witness.The nuclear option had been placed on the table.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------February 13, 2002Yet another statement from Burrell was delivered to the police—this time about ameeting with the queen.They’d talked for three hours, he’d said, sitting on her sofa together shortlyafter Princess Diana’s death.The queen had told him, he said, that his relationship with Diana wasunprecedented.She had spoken about how much she herself had tried to help the princess, andalso warned him to be careful—so many people were against Princess Diana, and hehad—seemingly—sided with her.However, the CPS lawyers decided that since Burrell’s statement made no mentionof Diana’s property, it was irrelevant to the case. (Whether the statements wererelevant to Diana’s ultimate fate, and the plots against her, is, of course,another matter entirely.)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------August 27Burrell’s lawyer again approached the police, insisting that a message be passedon to Charles.His client, he said, was offering to return all the royal items in hispossession if the prosecution was dropped.The message was never delivered but, somehow, the prince nonetheless becameaware of the butler’s offer—and hoped it would stop the trial going ahead.Legally, however, that was impossible: the CPS now had sole responsibility forthe prosecution. Nevertheless, Charles ordered his new private secretary, SirMichael Peat, to express his concern about continuing with the prosecution if itwas a lost cause.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------October 14Paul Burrell, then aged forty-four, stood in the dock of Court One at the OldBailey, and was officially accused of stealing 310 items from Diana’s privatechambers, together worth $5.9 million.Other items taken from his house were not listed because they allegedly belongedto either Charles or William, and neither wished to appear in court aswitnesses.The day’s proceedings made blazing headlines in all the media, raisingincreasing concern at St. James’s Palace.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------October 28Just after 8:30 that Monday morning, eleven days into the trial, CrownProsecutor William Boyce was reading his papers in a small room adjacent to thecourt when he was unexpectedly joined by Commander Yates.“I’ve just had a conversation with Michael Peat,” said Yates, then repeated theprivate secretary’s exact words: “Her Majesty has had a recollection.”Rarely has a six-word sentence meant so very much to a man’s fate, or to a royalfamily.On the previous Friday, Peat explained, the queen had recalled a meeting fiveyears earlier, soon after Diana’s death.Burrell had come to the palace to tell her about preserving some of theprincess’s papers.“The queen agreed that he should care for them,” said Peat.Boyce visibly paled. Taking off his wig, he seemed to shrink.Only by questioning the queen in court could Burrell’s version of theconversation be rebutted, and that was constitutionally impossible.No reigning monarch could appear in “Her Majesty’s court.”“That’s the end of the trial,” was Boyce’s view. Later in the day, Peat told CPSlawyers more about the queen’s recollection.On the previous Friday, she, Charles, and Philip had driven together to St.Paul’s for a memorial service for the victims of the Bali bombing.Driving past the Old Bailey, she asked why a crowd was standing outside. Charlesanswered that Paul Burrell was on trial. The queen was apparently unaware thathe was being prosecuted.Then she mentioned that, some years before, Burrell had sought an audience withher to explain that he was caring for some of Diana’s papers, and she’d agreedthat he should do so.To some in the prosecution and to police at the Old Bailey, the circumstances ofthe recollection described by Peat lacked credibility.But “an act of genius,” was the judgment of one Whitehall observer who said,“Only a golden bullet could have stopped the trial.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------November 1Crown Prosecutor Boyce announced in the courtroom that the trial was over.Charles and Peat breathed sighs of relief.The danger to them—for the moment, at least—had passed.What did the royal family fear? What was so harrowing that they were willing tocall off the trial? What would have been revealed in open court? Any lawyer cantell you that trials do not always unfold as you expect them to. Anything canhappen.Some chose to believe that, quite simply, the idea of the queen herself beingcalled to testify—and to be challenged openly by a lawyer—was too much forhang-wringing royals to bear. Others believe the queen might have been forced tolie in court. Or—most terrifying of all to those involved in the plot againstDiana—that the queen might have grown a conscience in the dock, and chosen tospeak the truth about what actually happened and which forces were truly at playin matters regarding the life and death of her former daughter-in-law.With hungry journalists sniffing around each and every corner, it did not makesense to risk even giving them the slightest scent.At the time, most qualified observers believed that her sudden recollectionstemmed from Burrell’s ability to confirm that Charles was not entirelyheterosexual. Keeping this kind of information quiet was not without precedent.Charles’s beloved great-uncle Lord Louis Mountbatten was bisexual and famouslyrumored to have had an affair with Edward VIII when he accompanied the youngprince of Wales on his empire tours.Charles clearly modeled after him. Charles thought of Mountbatten as hisgrandfather and wept at his funeral after the lord was killed by the IRA.Another “close friend” of Mountbatten’s was an Irish student whom he met atCambridge, Peter Murphy, who became his close and constant companion until theend of his life.Lord Louis, who would go on to become governor of India, married Edwina, afabulously wealthy socialite, who was to have a torrid affair with PanditjiNehru, Prime Minister of India.Before his marriage to Marina of Greece, the duke of Kent is supposed to haveenjoyed the company of thin blond men. He was once even arrested for engaging inhomosexual activity but released when his identity was confirmed.The papers may not have reported on his indiscretions, but all of high societyknew about them. To this day his papers are sealed at Windsor Castle, and noresearchers are allowed to look at them.Yet in the weeks and months that followed the trial’s abrupt end, journalistsinvolved began to dig a bit deeper. Was there something more than theconcealment of bisexuality at play? It felt as though the trail’s handlingconfirmed that the royals were certainly hiding something…but what? Thepossibilities seemed endless.However, the inability of anyone to ever recover the “Crown Jewels” suggests thepursuit might all have been a red herring—as it is now believed everythinghoarded by Diana has been destroyed after the items taken by Burrell fromDiana’s apartment were seized in their 2001 dawn raid on his home.A trunk of royal secrets Diana had entrusted to Dodi’s dad is also said to havevanished in the chaotic period following her death—and is now suspected by manyexperts to have been taken by British operatives.The tycoon’s suspicions Diana and his son were killed to prevent the royalfamily from being “polluted” by his Muslim family further forced British policeto investigate 175 conspiracy theories into her death. And his campaign to proveDiana’s crash was no accident was driven largely by a hoard of secrets shehanded him before her death; they were locked in a box with her initials on thelid that she said contained the reasons she would be assassinated.Mohamed Al-Fayed has insisted Britain’s MI6 spy agency was behind the crash,after which he went to retrieve the box—but he found it was empty.Private investigators believe British government agents beat him to it anddestroyed the contents. Mohamed Al-Fayed now insists Philip and the royalscouldn’t bear the prospect of Diana marrying a Muslim and having his baby, onceranting to US shock jock Howard Stern, “Do you think this bloody racist familywould have allowed that to happen?”He also told the 2008 inquest into Diana’s death, “I will not rest until Idie—even if I lose everything to find the truth. Diana suffered for twenty yearsfrom this Dracula family.”He also insists Diana was pregnant with Dodi’s child and said the couple waspreparing to announce their shock engagement the day after they died in Paris.There is corroboration that files and dossiers related to Diana and thecircumstances of her death have—without out a doubt—been destroyed…but perhapsnot in the way you might first expect.For example, Diana’s personal psychic confirmed that she torched a thick dossieron land mines given to her by the royal—as she feared it would lead to her beingkilled.Simone Simmons, the psychic recruited by Diana to give her “energy healing,”also revealed the duke of Edinburgh wrote “cruel and disparaging” letters toPrincess Diana—that she hinted at having seen firsthand—which have also sincemysteriously vanished.Simone said Diana had given her a copy of a dossier about the land mine industryshe had compiled during her campaign against the weapons. The psychic said shehad hidden this under her mattress, along with other documents from theprincess.Simone added that the land mine dossier was several inches thick but that shehad burnt it after Diana’s death because she was afraid of what might happen toher.She said, “I believed that if they could bump Diana off, then they could bumpanyone off—and I value my life.”CHAPTER TWELVEIn the aftermath of Diana’s death, agents were everywhere. The royal familycolluded with a merciless mob of British spies to collect photographs of Diana’snightmare death scene—as they feared the images contained evidence of their plotto assassinate the tragic mum-of-two. It was a cover-up worth millions.The agents—handpicked for their ruthlessness—unleashed a campaign ofintimidation in the days and years following Diana’s death to gather thepictures from some of the world’s leading paparazzi.Now, for the first time through this investigation, Diana: Case Closed canreveal evidence of the sinister plot to hide any proof of the royal family’sinvolvement in Diana’s death.We can confirm from multiple sources that veteran photographers in the Paristunnel where Diana and Dodi crashed at speeds upward of 121 mph were bullied,bribed, and blackmailed into handing over negatives of the images they took todocument the horrific crash.These are the chilling conclusions of two of the world’s longest-standing pressphotographers—who spent years snapping Diana and have finally spoken out aboutthe diabolical plot to murder the princess on the twenty-first anniversary ofher death.They fear the photos were snatched because they contain the faces of Diana’sassassins and the agents behind the mysterious beam of white light said to havebeen flashed into the face of Diana’s driver to make him crash.We here reveal interviews with two of the world’s most famous paparazziphotographers that reveal their terrifying belief photos collected of Diana andher death scene were stolen in the wake of the 1997 tragedy—by agents whotargeted one of them with bugging equipment, phone threats, and a suspected bombplot.In an exclusive interview, one source—who spoke strictly on condition ofanonymity for fear of repercussions from British secret services—said:The biggest single indication there was a conspiracy to kill Diana is that theimages taken the night she died have never come out. That’s because spies actingon orders from the royal family either stole the photographs, or used bully-boytactics to intimidated the snappers who took them into handing over theirpictures. I know paparazzi in the tunnel the night Diana died who were paidvisits by secret service agents and told to hand over their photos of Diana inthe tunnel or face the “gravest consequences” for themselves and their families.Some of them were shown dossiers on their private lives containing personalsecrets to force them into handing over their images. Others who had cleanerprivate lives were threatened with violence and financial ruin if they didn’thand over their pictures. They wanted the images so there would be nophotographic evidence of their assassination of Diana and the assassins who wereloitering in that tunnel in the aftermath of the crash on the night.The source added they estimated the royal family and spies spent $10 million toobtain death site photos from paps.It’s thought that a total of twelve paparazzi were in the tunnel where Dianacrashed.Seven of the photographers—Romuald Rat, Serge Arnal, Jacques Langevin, NikolaArsov, Laslo Veres, Christian Martinez, and Stephane Darmon—were hauled intocustody after the crash killed Diana, before being cleared of manslaughtercharges in a French court.The source said:This was a classic intelligence community tactic—haul people in under the guiseof investigating their movements so they can then bully them into doing whatthey wanted. The move also started a hate campaign against paparazzi—all todistract from the role spies had in assassinating Diana. Paparazzi photographerswere to Diana’s death what Lee Harvey Oswald was to JFK’s shooting—scapegoatsfor a conspiracy brewed in the corridors of power.Pictures taken at the time of Diana’s crash are thought to contain evidence of ablinding flash of light being beamed at Diana’s driver Henri Paul, forcing himto crash.The source added the violent lengths to which the agents were prepared to go toobtain photographs taken at the scene of Diana’s crash is demonstrated by whathe and many others are convinced was the murder of one of the world’s mostprofitable paparazzi.The source also claims the death of Andanson was “100 percent assassinated.”James was a pap some believed to have been recruited by ruthless agents andforced to become part of Diana’s assassination team. Though it was a story thatColin had found initially fantastic, the source told us something we didn’tknow: there were also two bullet holes in Andanson’s head when they found himburned. He’d apparently also bragged of secretly taking “explosive” photos ofthe scene, and even bragged of driving the second vehicle, if you believe therumors. And for reasons unexplained to this day, Andanson was boarding a planebound for Corsica less than six hours after the crash. With this newinformation, it was something we, as an investigative team, would need to focuson, and we did.In the weeks leading up to James’s death, he had a series of meetings with famedFrench crime author Frédéric Dard to discuss the book that would “blow the lidoff a conspiracy” to kill the princess.In yet another twist, Frédéric also died in 2000, a few weeks after James’sapparent “suicide.”Because the critically acclaimed author—beloved in France for writing more thanthree hundred crime novels—was killed by a heart attack aged seventy-eight, andonly a handful of confidants knew of his meeting with James, Frédéric’s deathwas not immediately linked to the web of Diana conspiracy theories.We can also reveal today how an additional paparazzo believe he was targeted byspies in the wake of Diana’s crash.Darryn Lyons, age fifty-two, dubbed “Mr. Paparazzi” while running London-basedagency Big Pictures during the 1990s, is convinced Diana was assassinated.He was one of the first people to be sent photographs of Diana’s death scene onAugust 31, 1997—and his offices were then almost immediately targeted in what hebelieves was a burglary, in an attempt by the secret services to obtain thesnaps.Days later, according to Darryn, he came to his office to find it in darkness,with the cause of the power loss never identified.His Big Pictures agency was also hit with telephone death threats, and Darrynthen heard a ticking noise at the premises he reported as a bomb—before becomingconvinced the agency’s phones were bugged after hearing “clicking noises on theline.”Darryn also offers his own bewildered take on the conspiracy behind the killing,based on his firsthand access to the scene, telling us, “The rumors are it wasthe white Fiat. But it’s too many things I don’t understand. The whole accidenthas never been explained to us [photographers] either. No one really, reallyknows.”On September 2, 1997, Darryn handed over copies of the Diana death pictures hehad been sent to a police constable from Islington Police Station.He has since said he feels “lucky not to have been killed in all the cloak anddagger stuff” in the wake of Diana’s death.Interviewed for this book, here is Darryn’s full account of the shadycircumstances surrounding the incidents:On the night in question, I spoke to Piers Morgan, who was editor, I think, atthe Daily Mirror at the time. I know Phil Hall was editor of the News of theWorld, and he was talking directly to Rupert Murdoch at the time. I had theworld exclusive at my feet.Not even the editors at the time believed what was going on, and they weremaking checks anywhere, and nothing was coming through the wire services. Thesephotos were literally minutes after the accident. They were extraordinary andvery graphic.Our information was that Diana was certainly unconscious, and that it looked asif she may have broken an arm or something to that effect.There’s no way we knew the seriousness of it at the time. But we did know thatDodi was in terrible trouble.I was in communication with the editor of the News of the World at the time.Naturally, on such a big story like this, money was being talked about for theexclusive right to publish the pictures.Because people were still not believing that this had actually happened. Itunfolded, very quickly. I spoke to Piers Morgan, and we had a very in-depthconversation. He was an incredible voice of reason for me about the situation.When we found out that Diana had passed away, those pictures had to be taken offthe market. I was inundated—naturally—with calls from around the world about thepictures. But I had made the decision these were pictures that the world shouldnot be seeing.You wouldn’t have said from the photos that I saw coming into our office inLondon that the princess of Wales was going to pass away. She looked like anangel, serene, with a smile on her face and only a small cut on her forehead.(The photograph has never been published.)On the second night after Diana’s death, things started to get very, verystrange. We had worked pretty solidly for forty-eight to seventy-two hours, notonly fielding calls about the photos, but from media outlets seeking interviews,and we were trying to get a handle on the fallout of what was going on. You’vegot to remember, we had seven to ten days of incredible pictures of the princessof Wales. There was tremendous interest in Big Pictures at the time.I decided—for a bit of a relief as much as a thank-you—to take the staff out toacknowledge their incredible efforts. We went to an establishment just down theroad; no more than three hundred or four hundred meters to a courier house.We weren’t there that long. When we went back to the office, I rememberunlocking the door and the alarm wasn’t set, which was the number one sign thatsomething unusual had happened, because I know we had done it on the way out.Everything was on, except for the lights were completely out in our building.You’d normally have a grid go down, you wouldn’t have a whole property go down,in terms of power.It was just very eerie—and very strange. I walked through the door with a coupleof staff members behind me, and all of a sudden, I hear, it was like a “tick,tick, tick, tick, tick.”Then, I saw with my own eyes a shadowy character. It was like a silhouette ofsomeone. I heard movement, and then I heard this “tick, tick, tick, tick, tick”sound again, and I just screamed, “Get out.”I thought to myself, “Is there a bomb in here?”As time went on, we could hear other voices on the telephone lines. We couldhear tapping on the phones. We were definitely being listened to.There’s no question in my mind that we were under extreme surveillance. I alsototally understand that we would’ve been. But certainly, going back to thatnight, I had an immense amount of fear. I dialed the emergency services becauseit was just all very strange.I’ve never seen so many police arrive in my life. It was a huge amount of lawenforcement, who blocked off the road. The full monty had arrived.They went in and checked the building out and declared everything was okay. Thelights, I’m pretty sure, were still down, but no one could explain to me whythat was the case.We all gave detailed descriptions of what we saw, what we thought, and what wefelt.While we gave answers to questions, we never got answers to our questions.No question the highest level of security forces would’ve been extraordinarilyactive for the hours after Diana’s passing, and for many, many, many, many weeksand months after.As for our involvement, I do think there was an intelligence operation underwayin an attempt to get what we had and download it. Whether that was successful ornot, I do not know. I assume yes.We began to receive death threats at our office. Every day, nonstop. Mymanagement team had to endure horrendous threats, on a minute-by-minute basis.There’s no question that not only myself, but also members of my staff did fearfor their safety and lives. Why? What could have happened? Who was behind it?Perhaps we will never know.I have no idea if Diana’s death was a result of a conspiracy. I’m merely sayingthat there were so many unexplainable issues on why things happened,particularly surrounding the night it happened.Even though we’ve had inquiry after inquiry, I still think there’s someone thatwas involved in the accident.So, am I satisfied that that was just a simple car accident? No, I don’t think Iam.Another veteran pap who suspected his home was burgled by spies the night Dianacrashed was Frenchman Lionel Cherruault.He had spent years amassing a collection of images of Diana, and in a booktitled Death Of A Princess by Thomas Sancton and Scott MacLeod, Lionel is quotedsaying a police officer visited his house after the investigation into therobbery—to warn him it was not an ordinary crime.The book said:Next day, a police detective appeared at the apartment. “I must tell yousomething,” he said clutching a sheaf of papers in his hand. “I’ve just readthis report. I have to confirm that you were not burgled.”“You mean they were gray men?” said Cherruault, using a euphemism forintelligence agents.“Call them what you like,” replied the detective. “You were not burgled.”And this conspiracy goes all the way up to the queen.Her notoriously stiff upper lip finally quivered days after Diana’s death as shestood in Buckingham Palace and confessed, “There are powers at work in thiscountry about which we have no knowledge.”Queen Elizabeth’s stunning admission was made to Diana’s butler Paul Burrellduring a conversation about Diana’s personal files, tape recordings, andpossessions he had lifted from her Kensington Palace apartment just after herdeath was announced.As revealed earlier, they are the files and recordings that could have costDiana her life.Burrell interpreted the queen’s statement as a warning to him in his astonishingthree-hour meeting with the monarch that his close friendship with Diana couldput his life in danger.He said, “I told Her Majesty I intended to protect the princess’s world and keepsafe her secrets. The queen responded by nodding her approval and smiling. Therewere many she could have been referring to. But she was clearly warning me to bevigilant. She had made clear she was deadly serious, and added, ‘Be careful,Paul, no one has been as close to a member of my family as you have.’”The aide added about the queen’s warning, “I think it was a general ‘Be carefulwarning’ over many issues. This was unprecedented times and as the queen said tome, no one has been as close to a member of my family and this has neverhappened before. The queen is a good, kind, devout lady and she looks aftermembers of her staff who look after her on a daily basis. As I had done to her,she extended me the kindness of looking after me.”We can reveal Burrell’s interpretation of the warning is believed to be far fromthe truth.A source close to the investigation into Diana’s death—whose identity must beshielded due to their fear of repercussions, even twenty-one years after thetragedy—said:What the queen was really telling Paul was that he should never, ever revealwhat was on the recordings he took from Diana’s apartments—or he would be nextin the firing line.What she was actually trying to tell him was that Diana had been murdered, andshe knew it. The queen would have thought her warning was as unsubtle as shecould make it, as veteran royals like her act like high-ranking members of themob. They never say anything that can incriminate them and speak in anaristocratic code that was obviously way above Paul’s plebian head. Even whenthe queen was clearly giving him a stern warning, he filters it through his egoand believes she is speaking to him as an equal, and not like a subject whocould be easily crushed.The royal family is not called “the firm” for nothing. It’s a family in the sameway the Mafia is a family.CHAPTER THIRTEENThey were everywhere.From scorned ex-lovers to angered international arms dealers, Diana had anenemies list like few have ever seen—a list much longer than Colin and I, asinvestigators, put together. Between her own countless premonitions of death tothe outright threats against her, it is a wonder she lived so long. Nations,international conglomerates, and the British royal family all stood to benefitfrom her shutting up and going away forever—and such a thing can be accomplisheda number of ways. Yet foremost among them, and certainly foremost ineffectiveness, would be snuffing out Diana’s life entirely.Diana was a threat to the establishment for a host of reasons. For the royals,it was a reputation cost. Diana threatened to cheapen the monarchy; to blur theline between acceptable and unacceptable behavior for a member of the family.And most unnerving of all, she threatened to dispel the magic that madeoutsiders feel as though the royals were exceptional and special. If that wereto occur, many in the public might start asking questions about why the royalsare followed, tolerated, and subsidized in the first place. Everything thefamily had built could all come crashing down.And the powerful international entities Diana threatened saw her as a risk totheir very chummy way of doing business. To their racket. Land mines alone wereprobably enough to get Diana on their watch list.Consider the following: In Country A (as in the United States), there is a largemilitary defense contractor that makes land mines. In every election cycle,lobbyists in the employ of this defense contractor make heavy campaign donationsto politicians who support foreign aid to war-torn Country B. Once elected,these politicians green-light several billions of dollars in aid from Country Ato Country B. But there is a tacit understanding. Country B knows that it mustuse the preponderance of the funds received to arm itself against futureoppression…by purchasing arms from the defense contractor in Country A. It is aracket in which everybody wins.The defense contractor turns a few million in lobbying funds into a few billionin land mine sales. The politicians get their election coffers filled and stayin power. And the war-torn country gets a whole bunch of money for arms (with abit left over to grease the political wheels on their end, too).It was a nice, “legal” scheme for making money and solidifying power…and oneidealistic royal threatened to send it all crashing to the ground.Again, the wonder is not that Diana was killed—and she was killed—but that herlife was not taken sooner.One imagines that initially, the players involved must have looked to oneanother. Can’t the royal family handle it? Can’t the British government make hershut up and stop speaking out like this?But they could not, and they did not.Diana persisted.But she wasn’t killed as a result of an orchestrated execution. It was anall-too-familiar road accident. Here is how.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our new research has shown that the paparazzi were not to blame in Diana’sdeath, and that it was instead a case of someone being in the wrong place at thewrong time.Painstaking decades of work, in-person interviews with witnesses and thoseinvolved, as well as multiple visits to the crime scene have brought forthrevelations that French and/or British police either did not see, or were not ina position, politically, to acknowledge.We have found that on the night of her death, the $123,000 Mercedes that carriedDiana and others was capable of easily out-accelerating every single vehiclethat the members of the paparazzi were driving. In short, there was noneck-and-neck chase, as such a thing was an impossibility. The mass ofphotographers could not have kept up with her car. Period.Yet as her car neared the tunnel on that fateful night, there were numerouswitnesses—many, only auditory—who heard a loud screeching of tires. This couldonly have been the Mercedes braking suddenly. Why? Had driver Henri Paul simplyfailed to notice the tunnel that was right in front of him? Even in a somewhatintoxicated state, this seems unlikely.But something made him brake.Other witnesses claim to have seen a flash in the tunnel—or in the momentsbefore the car entered the tunnel—just before Diana’s death. It would seemeasy—perhaps too easy—to conclude that this flash was from a photographer’scamera. But when we stop and think, we have to ask how this could possibly be.Diana’s Mercedes was too fast. The paparazzi could not catch up with it. Theyarrived after the fact, of course, to take photos of the death car. But nonewere present when the vehicle literally met its doom.We can now, in this book, reveal that additional research into the circumstancesof Diana’s death brought forth two new witnesses—George and Sabine Dauzonne—whowere present at the accident and confirmed details to Colin of a particularscenario that has long been floated but never proven…until now.While the motorcycle make and models driven by the photographers were not ableto keep up with Diana’s car that night, two other vehicles were. These vehicleswere in close proximity to Diana’s car as it approached the tunnel. The vehicleswere a motorcycle and a white Fiat Uno that had joined the road late in thegame.The motorcyclist remains a mystery, but the Dauzonnes got a clear look at thedriver of the Uno, as Colin discovered.In the aftermath of the accident, a fragment of plastic was found by Frenchpolice. It came from a Fiat Uno. In addition, Diana’s Mercedes was found to havea smear of white paint upon it. This paint was analyzed, and found to be paintthat was only used by one manufacturer: Fiat. An exhaustive database search ofover 112,00 Fiats never found the elusive car. Despite calls to the public, noperson ever came forward as the driver.In the days after Diana’s death, during the inquest into what precisely hadhappened, no less an authority than Sir Richard Dearlove, former head of MI6,poured fuel on the fire that the “flash of light tunnel murder” scenario was notonly an established assassination format, but one that the British governmentitself had considered using in the past.Specifically, Dearlove outlined a scenario that the British government hadcontemplated deploying in the early 1990s to assassinate a senior Balkanpolitician by forcing a crash. When the politician’s car passed into a tunnel, ablinding flash device would have been deployed, bright enough to blind anddisorient the driver. (In a world in which the CIA has openly confirmedpossessing “heart attack guns” for decades, it requires no leap of faith totrust that a blinding device such as this existed in 1997.) The flash would bemistaken by any bystanders as a photograph, but the effects would be deadly. Thedriver of the car would lose control of the vehicle and crash into the tunnel insuch a way that the death of the target would be essentially assured.A year after Dearlove’s testimony, Richard Tomlinson, a former British spy, alsopublicly confirmed and corroborated Dearlove’s account.What seems possible is that the mysterious lone motorcyclist deployed thisblinding device while Diana’s car was in the tunnel. In her memoir Spies, Liesand Whistleblowers, former MI5 agent Annie Machon confirms her belief that thisis precisely what happened.What was the Fiat Uno’s role? Did it somehow assist in the deployment of thedevice? Did the driver steer his car in such a way so to help the motorcyclistin deploying it? Or was he or she merely an Oswald-like patsy? Was the car onlythere to soak up blame and attention in the aftermath, to distract investigatorsfrom the real clues? Or was it, as we believe, a simple and routine caraccident.We would know the answers to many of these queries if we had, for example,footage of the accident.There were two CCTV cameras in the Pont de l’Alma underpass, but neitherrecorded footage of the fatal collision. They were either malfunctioning on thenight in question, or not positioned to shoot the correct part of the tunnel.This too unbelievable to be dismissed as a coincidence.Indeed, a French judicial inquiry into the crash was told that neither camerawas working on the night in question. Both, unbelievably, were broken. However,one motorist who came forward to the press shared that he received a speedingticket after being caught on a tunnel camera just fifteen minutes prior to theaccident.But a lack of cameras was not enough. The flash-attack itself was not enough.The conspirators had to do more.French security services who were part of the cover-up leaked information to thepress that Henri Paul was a drunk, and was three-and-a-half times over the legallimit on the night of the crash. They also switched his blood sample at the lab,replacing his with that of an alcoholic. This was all but proved when Paul’sphysician confirmed which medications Paul was taking, and that those drugs didnot show up in his system.If you believe some armchair detectives, however, Henri Paul was sober as ajudge when he was attacked and disoriented with a top-secret government lightdevice that likely rendered him more severely disoriented than any amount ofdrinks could do.It all comes back to Diana’s own words in the death note:This particular phase in my life is the most dangerous. My husband is planning“an accident” in my car, brake failure and serious head injury in order to makethe path clear for him to marry.In October 1995, the princess told Lord Mishcon, her solicitor, that “reliablesources” had informed her of the prince’s plans “that she and Camilla would beput aside.” We find this document today in the National Archive in London.If the disbelievers are to be believed, Diana was murdered, and she was murderedby forces with leading-edge spy technology, and with the power to createinternational complicity between governments and government agencies. She wasjust that dangerous, and just that powerful. Because of her behavior, she had tobe stopped. This story could have ended no other way.Yet our story continues, with a unique and unprecedented encounter with one ofthe chief players. And what it reveals shines an entirely new light on whathappened.Armed with this information, we knew what we had to do.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------DETECTIVE’S NOTEBOOKDATELINE: October 1997, five weeks after Diana’s deathIt was now just over a month since the horrid accident had changed the lives ofso many and caused the biggest outpouring of grief that the modern UK has everknown. The instant I opened the door to my warehouse back in Melbourne I turfedthe dog-eared newspaper clippings I had carried for three weeks to one side,scattering them across the floor, to come to rest with the waiting cans ofpaint. I looked at the cans of paint and looked away, too occupied by mycrime-scene analysis from Paris to think of renovations.My first task, I thought, once I had sidestepped my building needs, would be toseek out an independent expert opinion.I needed to know who drove that second car!I also needed an automotive engineer to tabulate and interpret the last journeyof the Mercedes-Benz, so I got on with my search for such an individual.Melbourne has a robust automotive industry; back in 1997, there were five majorcar manufacturers as well as many engineers in allied fields such as motorcyclemanufacturers, truck and farming equipment, and the aircraft industries. Allexcelled in their fields and supplied either components or finished products tothe Australian market, as well as being exported around the globe. I burroweddown and, like most detectives, I hit the phones and rang a string of contacts.I soon discovered an engineer that was a cut above almost all others. VincentMessina fitted the bill. At that time, he had twenty-five years’ experienceunder his grease-stained belt. With an honors degree in engineering computingand design, he was the proprietor of DAPS Australia Pty. Ltd, a business focusedon the creation of specialized vehicle testing systems used by automotivemanufacturers worldwide—specifically to analyze speed, inertia, and braking. Iknew full well that the answers in the Mercedes lay in understanding the inertiaof the car. And the answer to the second car would follow.Vincent had cut his teeth on the vast production lines of the Ford automotivecompany, managing crews of as many as a hundred mechanics, body fitters, andengineers. His skill took him to the United States, where he managed a workshopfor Ford Atlanta, in charge of hundreds of highly skilled men and women,building today’s cars to last well into the future. Vincent would ultimatelyleave the mainstream automotive industry to create his own high-end equipment,under his own badge: DAPS Australia, the first company in the world to come upwith complex computer analysis equipment to enable engineers to read speed, invarious forums. To simplify matters, Vincent’s technology could dynamicallyunderstand the exact speed a car was doing, at any given moment of its journey,by reading the ABS braking system. By 1997, virtually all motorcars were fittedwith ABS brakes. Certainly, Mercedes-Benz prided themselves in having the bestsystem available, that of Bosch, from Germany. Further, should Vincent and histeam of clever engineers be supplied with evidence of previous speed undertakenby a vehicle, such as video footage or even skid marks, then his analysisequipment could provide, within a high level of certainty, the speed of thevehicle.A further and somewhat unique feature of my chosen expert’s career was histwenty-year involvement in motor racing, holding various national titles forsuper-bike racing and sidecar sprints. He was not only an automotive expert, butalso a practitioner of speed. Highly esteemed in both the worlds of motor sportsand engineering, Vincent also built racing machines from scratch and delightedin seeing them win national titles. In time this talented man would go on tobuild a 417-horsepower motorcycle, which he called the Aurora Hellfire V8,simply the fastest production motorcycle the world has ever seen, a true work ofmetallic art. Its top speed is north of 340 kph (210 mph). Vincent would proveto be just the man for my task. Constantly on the move, traveling the world,installing his equipment and teaching engineers how to operate his complexgadgetry, and developing his super bike, Vincent was going to be a hard man topin down.In the case of the Mercedes-Benz 280 in which Princess Diana was a passenger, Iwas in possession of what I believed may be two parallel skid marks thatbelonged to the same Mercedes. My many photographs showed the skid marks invarious dimensions; side on, bird’s-eye view, and in relation to the roadsurface and its changing conditions as the road surface entered the tunnel.A duplicate set of images lay in a folder awaiting Vincent’s return to thesouthern hemisphere; as luck would have it, this coincided with the lastfoolscap sheet of my notes being added to his waiting pile. I gathered my imagestogether and booked an appointment with the skeptical secretary to meet Vincent.At the meeting and after what must have seemed like a lecture on the subject, (Iwent for more than two hours!) he graciously received my notes, sketches,detailed measurements, and photographs. One set of images appeared to worry him,those showing the tire residue on the side of the capping. I presented him witha small specimen canister containing the rubber residue that I had collectedfrom that capping, back in Paris, within minutes of first observing the saidrubber residue. I told Vincent how I lightly brushed the palm of my hand acrossthe minute bristles of rubber and how they fell away to the road surface—anindication of fresh the rubber was, as surely had it rained at the time therubber adhered to the capping (or in the few days since my arrival in Paris) andthe force of the raindrops would have removed the bristles.Vincent opened the tiny canister and tipped the bristles onto his palm and,after rolling the fibers between his fingers, Vincent stated that not only wasit unequivocally car tire residue, but that it appeared free from contamination,not weathered. His only comment on the photographs showing the parallel skidmarks was at how rich, dark, the rubber appeared, indicating that the skid markswere probably reasonable fresh. He felt my thirty or forty photographs showedthe skid marks clearly and that after analysis the wheelbase should be readilyidentifiable. From there, we would be able to work out the make and type ofvehicle that left behind its two telling rubber marks.Vincent familiarized himself with the photographic depiction of the scene at thePlace de l’Alma. My images clearly showed the many scars, fresh scratches andgouges on the vertical surface of the retaining wall that is both left and rightof the roadway before it becomes a tunnel. We both agreed that these scarsclearly indicated a car out of control. Indeed, we agreed there had to have beentwo cars to make these harsh markings as, on one occasion, in one position, thescarring marks were opposite each other. No one car could create that sequenceof scarring.Of course, I had always believed there were two cars involved. One feature ofthe roadway yelled and screamed at me that two cars had to have been involved:the merge lane and its relationship with the two long skid marks. The closenessof these two features smacked of an unknown car trying to enter the fast-movingroadway, which caused the Mercedes-Benz driver to brake sharply, hence theskids.It was then that Vincent queried a telltale set of markings in the skids. Toexplain better, skid marks usually show a set of parallel rubber marks, eachrunning in a neat straight line (the tread of the tire). In the two skid marksthat I photographed, there was the presence of wavers or fluctuations in thetire residue of the skid marks. The straight rubber line had an interruption toits neat line. This interruption was obvious to the trained eye, to Vincent’seye. As some of my images were taken up close, the wavers or fluctuations wereclearly visible, showing the composition of the said fluctuations. At one partof the tire tread they represented a “bubble” shape in the tread, where thereshould have been a straight line. This fascinated Vincent and a smile graced hisface. He offered nothing more. And with that, Vincent gathered up my materialsand left, heading off to his factory of sophisticated computers. I went back tomy boring renovations.He hadn’t been gone more than an hour or two when a breaking news story that thebroadcaster promised was of global proportions interrupted my afternoon’s work.The news reader on my small portable television announced that a team ofinvestigative journalists were alleging that Princess Diana and Dodi were“murdered in an SAS-style bomb attack.” Certainly, I had seen no evidencewhatsoever of any explosion: no soot, scarring, or blackening in the tunnel, onthe pillars, walls, or roof of the tunnel in the many days I had spent therejust after the accident. Now, I had another twist in the saga that claimedPrincess Diana’s life. Journalists—not police—alleging it was all part of abombing attack.The announcer went on with his tale and all its fascination. The story wasbolstered by claims that an explosives expert from Spain believed a pursuing cartriggered a deadly device. Apparently, the expert was able to state that anotherunknown car was tailing the Mercedes-Benz, only meters behind when it hadentered the tunnel, and that a remote-control device had been used to detonatethe bomb. I stood shaking my head. How could he look into the past? I couldn’thelp thinking of the crazy Hollywood-style story that the London solicitor GaryHunter once told the world media, and me. A story that ended up being a load ofrubbish.What the bombing story failed to say was that no residue of an explosion wasfound in the tunnel and the Mercedes, apart from hitting the pillar, showed noevidence of being fragmented. Nor did any of the approaching paparazzi or localsat the scene allude to seeing an explosion. In forensic terms an explosion is aneasy thing to detect. Despite the sensational story, the drama of explosives anda so-called expert with explosives, no further “facts,” were ever put forward byany worthwhile authority. As the newspapers say, the story came and went after aday. But it was a good story, for five minutes. And I got back to myrenovations, eagerly awaiting contact from my own expert, one the wasn’tsensational, nor keen to get himself on the television sets in millions ofhomes.As I waited, I would read the daily newspapers about many other similar andsensational claims of skullduggery or terrorists surrounding the death of thedethroned princess. It seemed that everyone was trying to attach a bizarretheory into the death of three people in a tunnel in the city of love. Withoutexception, each story was factually wrong. I felt that I had a very soundunderstanding of what had occurred as the Mercedes raced toward thetunnel—probably more than any other person on the planet. Certainly more thanthe French cops.Now, for all the notes that I had taken, all the measurements I had accumulated,I needed something solid to turn my investigative theory into crime-scene fact.I needed forensics. I needed an engineer to tell me a story that matched myinvestigative facts.During my waiting hiatus, a real game changer came into play: the French policefinally announced that there may have been a second vehicle involved in thecrash, as there was a foreign paint sample lifted from the front right wing ofthe Mercedes-Benz, yet to be analyzed. The police were feeding the chooks, asdetectives say, throwing the media a juicy story to keep them in line. And juicyit was. It would prove my theory was correct. All of sudden, there seemed to bea chase on, between myself and the French cops to unravel what really happenedon the night of August 31, 1997. So far, I reckoned I was a few weeks ahead.A couple of weeks later, out of the blue, Vincent called, proffering a secondmeeting. He was the type to say little to nothing on the phone, so I sucked insome Melbourne spring air and headed outside. We met at a cozy café not far frommy warehouse and sat for most of the afternoon. Several espressos later I hadthe gist of his report of more than a dozen pages and sketches. His commentswere extensive and, obviously, full of engineer jargon. His serious face told metwo things: that he was a man of real skill, and that he had given the task hisbest. My translation of his debriefing went as follows:The tread pattern of the skid marks, which were clearing visible in myphotographs, were unable to be matched identically to the tire tread used by theMercedes-Benz motorcar company when manufacturing the 280 SL model.With the age of the vehicle and the fact that it had had many repairs, services,and been subject to a carjacking, Vincent was unable to say whether the treadrelated to the exact tires that were initially fitted at the factory when thevehicle first rolled off the production line.However, he was able to say the tread was consistent with tires used by themanufacturing company and listed in the Mercedes-Benz 280SL handbook.Furthermore, Vincent studied the width of the tires, identifiable from threemeasurements along the 22-foot skid marks. He found they were 200 mm, and statedthat the tread alignment was consistent with the wheelbase of the model 280 SL.To assist his calculations, he was guided by the manufacturer’s handbook, whichshowed the wheelbase center line to be 1,579 mm, a distance taken from thecenterline of the rear wheels. He then took the distance I gained, between theinside of the skid marks (1380 mm) and added the width of a factory-fitted tire(200 mm) to come up with a measurement one millimeter less than what it shouldhave been. He seemed happy to allow the one-millimeter difference for fading ormy measuring tape skills. I was thrilled at the result of his first analysis. Iknew then that the two skid marks I had photographed had come from aMercedes-Benz 280 sedan. The question could now be asked, with a fairly highlevel of certainty, as to how many other Mercedes-Benz 280 sedans could haveskidded at that exact same location, leaving behind the same two long—inparallel—skid marks? Obviously, the answer was zero; such a coincidence—Iconfidently suggest—was unfathomable.As a detective, I knew at that first set of answers from Vincent that I was onthe right track to solving this case.To determine the speed at which the Mercedes was traveling as it hurtled towardthe tunnel entrance, Vincent used the overall length of the skid marks to firstcalculate the speed of the vehicle prior to applying the brakes. He noted thatthe Mercedes-Benz S280 sedan was fitted with a standard Bosch antilock brakingsystem (ABS). The ABS is designed for high-speed detection of wheel lock. Thesystem is a microprocessor-controlled device that utilizes speed sensors on eachwheel that monitor the wheels rotation motion. Once the speed differencethreshold is exceeded for a wheel, the detected wheel(s) braking hydrauliccircuit is temporarily relieved, and the brake force is momentarily released.And so the process is repeated as the speed varies. The Bosch ABS system canelectronically pulse at twelve to eighteen cycles per minute as it reads andreacts to the speed of the vehicle. In real terms, the hydraulic circuit wouldtake around 100 to 300 milliseconds to physically release the line pressure on alocked wheel, dependent on the condition of the road surface: wet or dry, gravelor asphalt. My inquiries confirmed the road surface was dry, and being that itis a good asphalt surface, then the 150 milliseconds was the most reliable timeunit that Vincent used in his later calculations, allowing for the slightgrading of the roadway and the possibility of late-night dew on the surface. Thescene had two matching 22-foot-long skid marks that Vincent believed were thefront two wheels of the Mercedes. Using the above-mentioned times against the23-foot-long skid marks, the engineer was able to estimate the speed at which itwas traveling prior to applying the brakes and when the brakes were released,coincidently, at the same point where the road surface commenced to fall away.He was able to assess that the Mercedes traveled an average speed across theskid marks of at least 168 kph (104 mph), before the ABS unit was disengaged.With media reports suggesting the Mercedes-Benz was traveling at a speed of upto 190 kph (118 mph) prior to the accident (prior to the skid), Vincent was ableto state that this estimate was highly likely. He also noted that while it wasimpossible to precisely say what the speed was, the evidence of the 22-foot-longskid marks made the 190 kph (118 mph) theory credible.Vincent also believed that with the Mercedes-Benz traveling at 168 kph (104 mph)as it left the skid mark where the road surface started to fall away, acatastrophic ending was almost inevitable. With such acceleration, combined withthe fall in the road surface, the car would have firstly become airborne. Basedon the data he studied of the road length, fall, and surrounding conditions, theMercedes would have become airborne for a distance of 28 meters (90 feet). Thisrevelation was consistent with the tire rubber residue found on the cappingwall, which (coincidentally) was a similar distance away.Vincent added that both the impact points and the skid marks confirmed thepresence of a second vehicle at the accident scene. He explained that thepresence of wavers or fluctuations in the tire residue of the skid marks gaveclear evidence that at some point while the Mercedes was braking its inertia wasinterrupted, causing the fluctuations. The engineer also stated that unless theMercedes were somehow able to bounce from retaining wall to dividing wall andback again, a distance of over 26 meters (20 feet), it would have beenimpossible for it to be the only vehicle involved in the accident. The markingand scarring of the retaining walls and the obvious fluctuations in the skidmarks therefore confirmed that a second car was involved.The expert expanded, stating that the Mercedes was lightly clipped by anothercar that had entered the roadway from the merge lane. He noted that there wereno signs of the other car skidding at that point, indicating that the second carwas traveling slowly. The “glance” from the second car would have turned ordeflected the vehicle into the dividing wall on the left of the roadway, leavingthe way clear for the straight-ahead path of the speeding and now out-of-controlMercedes, which catapulted farther toward the capping. Due to the vastdifferentiation in speed of the two vehicles, the second car would probably havelimped along the left-hand side of the roadway and would likely have witnessedthe subsequent impact of the princess’s Mercedes as it careered into theretaining wall and its resulting carom into the thirteenth pillar within thetunnel.In conclusion, Vincent noted that the airborne Mercedes and its occupants wereunlucky not to have cleared the retaining wall. Had the driver been traveling amere 10 mph faster, the car would have gained the additional few centimeters inheight necessary to clear the capping and run up the adjacent flower bed andgrassy ascent. Vincent had little doubt, had this occurred, that the occupantsof the Mercedes would have survived.What follows is Vincent’s qualified account of the likely last 3.2 seconds ofthe princess’s journey in the rear seat of the Mercedes.Immediately prior to the driver applying the brakes, the Mercedes would havebeen traveling at a speed of arguably 190 kph, rapidly approaching a left-handcurve with a noticeable descent over a short distance. A proposition that wouldbe of real concern to a professional speed-racing driver, let alone a chauffeurin a drunken state.At the end of the skid marks as the road fell away the vehicle would have becomeairborne. The princess would have lurched forward; her unrestrained body wouldhave hit the front passenger seat with a force of up to eight times her bodyweight. At that point, she would have been a human projectile without any way ofstopping her propulsion. Her movement would not have altered until the Mercedescame crashing to the road surface about a second later. At that point she wouldhave been forced forward, slammed past the harnessed front seat passenger, andfinished up in the front section of the car over the console area. In anothersecond the Mercedes crashed into pillar thirteen.At that point the princess would have been flung to the dashboard and possiblythe windscreen. On each occasion that the princess was thrown forward the forceof her propelled body weight, and that of her unrestrained companion, DodiFayed, would serve to crush the manufactured strength of the front driver andpassenger seats, causing damage to the mountings.In effect, Princess Diana was flung about the cabin of the MercedesBenz likedice shaken in a cup. While all the occupants may have survived the initialtraumas, the force with which the Mercedes hit pillar thirteen would not havebeen survivable for anyone not wearing a properly fitted seat belt.In sum, Diana didn’t have to die. It would be expected that the princess wouldhave received serious cranial, shoulder, and chest injuries. Had she beenwearing a seat belt, she would in all likelihood have survived. Furthersubstantiation of the engineer’s theory can be found in the knowledge that theonly survivor, Trevor Rees-Jones, had been wearing his seat belt at the time ofthe crash.Curiously, he had only fastened the harness just prior to the accidentoccurring. There has been much speculation as to how this is known. The simpleanswer is that a police speed camera took one photograph of the vehicle as itcareered toward its tragic end, and the belted figure of Rees-Jones was clearlydepicted.Here was the most important witness in the entire saga, the only survivor, theman who could answer all the questions. Why were they traveling so fast? Whatwas the demeanor of Dodi and the princess as they entered the Cours Albert? Whatwere they fleeing, and why? But arguably the most important question he couldanswer was, as the individual in charge of the princess’s security—why did heallow an “inebriated” driver to charge of the transport of his own charge? Aworld waited for the answers that would never come.Following five weeks of intensive care treatment, it was announced thatRees-Jones had suffered amnesia and would possibly never recall his experienceof the world’s most infamous accident. Whatever contributing factors he wasaware of or involved in appeared to be forever locked in the darkest reaches ofhis mind. And for Vincent’s skills in analyzing speed and braking systems, hetoo was unable to offer any further explanation for the accident. He simply bademe farewell and headed for the airport. He was off to install his specialistequipment in a Korean car manufacturing plant and I was left holding the sumtotal of an independent investigation into the death of Princess Diana, Queen ofHearts.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------By October 1998 and with Vincent’s appraisal as evidence, I’d almost finishedwriting my report on the investigation. Before putting my real report on thecrash to bed, I faxed the Harrods executive with the dour face a sample tenpages of my report. It was what I said I would do when I met him the yearearlier. In sending the sampler I made it clear that there was no smoking gun,by way of any Muslim terrorist involvement uncovered in my investigation. Notsurprising, the London camp sought no further contact with me. It seemed thatsince Lady Diana’s death some folk only wanted to recall a version of the fineLady that suited them. It was just like Repossi Jewelers in the piazza oppositethe Ritz Hotel, whom I visited a week or so after I arrived in Paris to speakabout a rumor that they supplied an engagement ring to Dodi, for Diana. Theiranswer was a firm no, there was no ring. Now, all this time later, historyseemed to have changed: Repossi was claiming to all that they were the preferredjeweler to Dodi and Diana, and an engagement ring was ordered. And it was evenengraved! I started to see how legend was entering the story of the death of aprincess. Even Harrods had created a statue at their front door, in honor of theloving engaged couple. It appeared legend was becoming a focus instead of truth.As I pondered this sad shift of reality, I had to come to terms with a fact thatmy report into the death of Lady Diana and her companions would not fit intolegend or required reading, but find a home in the bottom drawer of my writingdesk. Still, despite this lesson of how history gets written, the circumstancessurrounding the case would continue to niggle at me like an errant eyelash.Two years later, a flurry of reports began to bounce around the media airwavescentering on the suspicious death of a leading French photographer, Jean-Paul“James” Andanson. The fifty-four-year-old paparazzi stalwart had been known tohound Princess Diana, selling his proofs of her to tabloids worldwide. A man atthe top of his game, he was considered financially secure. Now it was his imagethat had made it to the front pages of the grubby press. I pricked up my ears.On face value, the circumstances of the death appeared simple. A body wasdiscovered in Andanson’s car in rural France. Ruled suicide by petrolincineration, the remains were so badly charred that it took a month before DNAcould absolutely confirm his identity. Andanson had left behind a distraughtfamily and a shocked collection of work colleagues. Undeniably it was a tragicend to any life, but there was no evidence of a link to the August 31, 1997,accident at the Place de l’Alma.But no, one man’s wretched death was to become a theorist’s lifeblood. Andansonwas to be the latest name dragged into the sullied waters, his title changedfrom photographer to suspect, for Jean-Paul had once owned a white Fiat Unoautomobile.British news copy splashed scoops citing paint samples identical to those foundon the crashed Mercedes and claimed that, finally, here was the elusive secondcar. Mr. Andanson’s widow, they purported, loosely supported the theory that herhusband was involved. Every detail of his movements in August of 1997 wasscrutinized, his life was picked over, and his extended family was interviewed,even chased. With clever wording, journalists speculated that Andanson, “forreasons that he never revealed,” fled for Corsica on the day of the accident.Some theorists had even stated that the body of Jean-Paul had a bullet wound tohis head. The Al-Fayed camp hollered “murder” and demanded furtherinvestigations. Rumors began to circulate insinuating that Andanson hadassociations with secret agents from British and French Intelligence. It wasn’tlong before the world media jumped on the bandwagon once again, claiming thedeaths of Dodi and Diana as criminal. I shook my head in amazement whispering,“Here we go again.”The more I read, the more the tale began to resemble an Ian Fleming novel, withmentions of the CIA, government cover-ups, and even a midnight break-in at amedia office. Only a week after Andanson’s death was announced, tabloids alludedto “three masked men armed with handguns” who allegedly broke into a newspaperoffice in Paris. Shooting a security guard in the foot, the bandits thendismantled all the security cameras before stealing laptops and computers. Eventhe circumstances of a mere office break-in had been exaggerated to fit a theorythat CIA agents had staged an elaborate armed robbery to make away withrevealing facts.Pushing the papers aside, I leant back in my easy chair and pondered thenonsense that I was reading. Was this mere fancy, or was there really somethinghere that I had missed?Unsettled, I delved deeper. Police reports into the suicide showed a thoroughinvestigation revealing that the deceased did own a white Fiat, but insteadconcluded that it was totally un-roadworthy at the time of the accident, up onblocks in a garage. The evidence for this finding was conclusive. Further,Andanson himself was at home with his family on the night of the crash and haddeparted early the next morning to catch a prearranged business flight toCorsica—so much for the reports that his own wife had him as a suspect and thathis leaving France was in any way suspicious. As for the many hobby detectivesstating that the paint from Andanson’s Fiat categorically matched that depositedon the Mercedes, they were right. But what they neglected to mention was thatthe “Bianco 210” paint sprayed on the photographer’s car was the same “Bianco210” paint used by the Fiat factory for tens of thousands of their cars over atwo-year period. Fiat was the best-selling small car in Europe, and its mostpopular color was white.I was relieved to read the final police reports stating that the suicide ofAndanson was genuine and due to the breakdown of marital relations. There was nobullet hole, there was no murder, nor was there any justification for dragginganother name into the uncertainty surrounding the death of Princess Diana.Another chapter closed in the growing tome of conspiracy theories. None of thesetheories were helped by the annoyance that the French cops never bothered toanswer them, squash them, or firm them up.Years on, a coroner’s inquest was held in London into the death of PrincessDiana and her companions. Not only would an official cause of death bedelivered, but by wrestling it away from the French authorities the forum wouldallow a more probative approach, and hopefully deliver some answers. And perhapseven silence the stooges once and for all.Much was made at the commencement of the inquest of the need to hear evidencefrom Le Van Thanh. A man of Vietnamese ancestry, the thirty-two-year-old, afather of two, was a security guard at the time and believed to be the owner ofa white Fiat Uno—one of the 4,600 then registered in Paris. And yes, running torule, the public relations department of the Al-Fayed camp was again stirringthe pot, happy to step forward with insinuations that Mr. Thanh had aninvolvement in the tragedy on the August 31, 1997.Tabloid media devoured the story. For weeks, dingy bars were abuzz with claimsthat only hours after the accident Le Van Thanh’s Fiat had been sprayed red tomask damage caused by its impact with Diana’s Mercedes. Soon what had beennothing more than scuttlebutt began to gain credibility as a series of articlesin a more prominent London newspaper, the Times, appeared. Quoting Mr. Thanh’sfather, a journalist reported that the elder Thanh believed that his son hadbeen involved in the accident but had panicked and attempted to cover up bygiving his vehicle a new coat of paint. The result of the allegations againstMr. Le Van Thanh and his vehicle set in motion a media and paparazzi chasealmost unequaled in Paris since 1997; the man was hounded day and night.Theorists speculated that the paint from Thanh’s car would match that found onthe Mercedes, but once again the allegations omitted the universal “Bianco 210”information. Oddly, young Mr. Thanh stood his ground and refused to comment.French detectives subjected him to an arrest and escorted him in and out ofpolice headquarters, where his alibi was scrutinized in a six-hour interview.While it seems impossible to believe Van Thanh’s presence was a coincidence, itis possible, in theory, to believe that Van Thanh was a stooge or a dupe. Thatis to say, that he did not know who he was working for or with. That he did notknow who was being targeted that night in a tunnel in Paris. That he was asshocked as the rest of us to learn what the outcome of his action had been.The coroner’s inquest heard from an investigating detective that a journalisthad posed as a police officer and had offered Mr. Thanh, Sr. money for hiscomment. And while Le Van Thanh’s car certainly seemed to have been hastilyresprayed, it had been done so by Mr. Thanh’s brother, a panel beater, and overa series of days after the accident. This in itself was odd; the timing of theurgent respray was in sync with the timing of the accident involved in the deathof Lady Diana.Le Van Thanh claimed, however, that as per his time clock documentation andfellow worker attestations, he had been working night shift at a Renault storagecompound at the time of the accident. But he stated that he was unable to recallthe name of his coworker. Indeed, he failed to recall much of the that night—anight that his father recalled very well, whereby his son came home with anurgent need to respray his car from white to “beacon” red.On April 8th, 2008, the English coroner found that the cause of the accident hadrelated to the speed and manner of the driver of the Mercedes, as well as thespeed and manner of the pursuing paparazzi vehicles. I myself had formed thatsame opinion while at Paris in September 1997, and later, at the end of myindependent report. The only question that remains unanswered back in 2008 wassimple: “Where is the elusive Fiat Uno and where is its driver?” And to a lesserextent: “What will be the next conspiracy theory put forward by the Al-Fayedcamp?”Later, in 2015 and again in 2019, I would have the good luck to meet Le VanThanh and speak to him, at his home on the outskirts of Paris. It was those twoconversations and a face-to-face interview with the witness that identified LeVan Thanh (also in 2015) that would solidify my opinion as to who was the driverof the Fiat Uno that fateful night and how the accident actually happened.CHAPTER FOURTEENFinding the Fiat Uno was clearly the number one priority for any seriousinvestigation into Diana’s death. Initially, as has been explained, the searchidentified photographer Andanson as the driver.But in November 1997, French authorities located another man who, as we know,had painted his car red hours after the crash: a French Vietnamese national, LeVan Thanh, who claimed he was working security at the time of the crash. Butthen he was quickly ruled out, despite Colin finding him to be of more interest.So why would he respray his car? Could he be the key to cracking the case? Andwhy did the French police ignore this vital information? These questions werenever answered at the time, but our investigation would eventually circle back.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------DETECTIVE’S NOTEBOOKDATELINE: 2015 and onwardLater, in 2015, and again in 2019, I would revisit the death of Princess Dianaand pull out my files. Like most unsolved cases or cold cases, this one was likea thistle up my ass; I couldn’t get it out of my mind, couldn’t let go of it. Ihad to know the involvement—if any—of Le Van Thanh and why the Frenchauthorities chose to shut down their investigation after seizing his Fiat Uno.And why had the English investigation never compelled Le Van Thanh to giveevidence at their independent inquiry? Or, better still, hold a special sittingday in Paris, to accommodate Le Van Thanh?As it turned out, I would have the good luck to meet Le Van Thanh and speak tohim at his home on the outskirts of Paris. Twice. No other person has ever beenable to get a word out of Le Van Thanh. Since August 1997, he has chosen todoggedly ignore all attempts to speak about that summer night. It was my twoconversations with this most elusive person of interest that would ultimatelysatisfy my twenty-two-year search for the truth. Along with an extraordinaryface-to-face, three-hour interview with a female witness that was in the tunnelthat night, both would solidify my opinion as to who really was the driver ofthe Fiat Uno that fateful evening and how the accident really happened.In any major crime or horrific tragedy—such as the death of PrincessDiana—police will, invariably, receive hundreds of calls from the public. Ofcourse, what they are really hoping for is just one call from someone connectedto the incident. Public assistance is often the key to solving a crime. TheParis cops were flooded with calls from well-intended witnesses or passersby. Ibecame privy to some of the more important callers, however I never heard abouta lady that rang police shortly after Diana was pronounced dead. In fact, no oneknew of her until many years later.Sabine Dauzonne and her husband were dining in Paris that night, on the LeftBank, at their favorite restaurant. It was just after midnight and they bothcommenced their short journey home, driving their Rolls-Royce motorcar. Theycrossed over the Seine river at the exact spot where the accident happened andentered a merge lane that fed traffic onto the Cours Albert, the fast-movingroadway that the Mercedes raced along before entering the tunnel. (This mergelane is not the one the Fiat Uno used to enter the Cours Albert. It’s actuallythe merge lane at the exit end of the tunnel.)As the Rolls-Royce cleared the merge lane, it attempted to take a position onthe roadway. It was then that it became stuck behind a small motorcar, a whiteFiat Uno. In effect, it was traveling so slowly it was blocking the bigger car’spath. There were no other cars on the roadway. The Fiat had come out of thetunnel, just feet behind, and as the Rolls-Royce fell in behind it, Sabine tooka good look at the slow-moving vehicle. She noticed the last two digits of theregistration plate as “92.” This, she knew to be a Parisian registered car, asnumber ninety-two denotes one of the arrondissements of Paris. Her husbandGeorge had trouble trying to pass the Fiat as it was zigzagging around. Sabineand George got a good look at the driver. They later reported this extraordinaryobservation to police, but they were ignored. Days went by and Sabine contactedpolice again, to no avail. No one seemed interested in flushing out better andfurther particulars on this mystery driver and the elusive Fiat Uno. No oneexcept me. Yet, I would discover that Le Van Thanh was arrested, in November1997, after his Fiat Uno was one of the thousands of white Fiats inspected. Thetrouble was the Fiat Le Van Thanh drove to the police station was now red incolor. The cops underwent a formal interview with the boyish security guard,then raided his home. The raid yielded very little, except a massive Dobermantype black and tan watchdog wearing a muzzle. Le Van Thanh would walk home fromhis police interview as his car went off to the Forensic laboratory for analysisand no one heard anymore. Le Van Thanh and his now red car, resprayed hoursafter the death of Lady Diana, had become an elephant in the room, and stay thatway.For that first interview, I was back in Paris in 2015 and involved in pullingtogether a documentary into the death of Princess Diana for an Americantelevision network. During my research I came across the snippet of informationfrom Sabine and George and almost fell off my chair. You might guess correctlythat I instantly set up a meeting with Sabine, and she obliged, still a littleperplexed that no French police had bothered to interview after eighteen years.I met her in her beautiful apartment building and found her to be an extremelyarticulate woman, highly intelligent and with a very clear memory of the nightof August 31, 1997.In the world of the detective you meet with many witnesses. A great many arevery diligent people who have a story to tell. Others are a tad reticent, andyou have to hold their hand as the story falls from their lips. And there are afew that I call nuisances, that just want to be part of the mystery. It’s alucky dip, really, when you knock on the door of any potential witness as towhether you will waste an hour of your life or discover gold. Sabine was gold.The perfect witness that had a more in-depth story inside her. A story supportedby her husband George. Yet, the French cops missed it all.I would spend more than three hours sitting with Sabine and filming herrecollections of that night. In short, she recalled, after entering the CoursAlbert roadway, she and her husband were very careful not to collide with theerratic Fiat, as it seemed to slowly stagger onward. In an attempt to pass theFiat, they went to the driver’s side and eventually moved alongside the car. Itwas then that they noticed there were dents and scrapes on the car and scrapesalong the entire left side, the driver’s side, from the taillight to the frontof the driver’s door.Sabine was able to study the driver, as she initially thought he might be drunk.She observed a young man, who spent a lot of his time looking back into thetunnel. He seemed preoccupied with looking backwards, instead of drivingforward. Sabine described his behavior as “agitated.” She also described thedriver to be a small man with short dark hair and a tanned face. Then shementioned a dog. A very big dog, black and tan in color, a Doberman type, seatedon the back seat and looking at her. The dog was wearing a muzzle on its face.Bingo!Sabine and her husband continued to watch the Fiat for a few more seconds untilthey needed to increase their speed up to 60 mph. They then drove off, with theimage of the driver and Fiat and dog etched into their memory.I then asked her to look at various photographs, and it was without hesitationthe she pointed out the image of Le Van Thanh as the man in the driver’s seat.The picture of Le Van Thanh I showed her was one taken back in 1998, with Le Vanseated at his now red-colored Fiat. The image is unusual insofar as Le Van doesnot have distinctively Asian facial features. He could look Central American,Asian, or an ethnicity that is difficult to determine, at night, in a car,looking around “agitated.” He could look French.Interestingly, Sabine offered no ethnicity in her description, just a young man,tanned skin, and short black hair, which form the facial features of Le Van.In short, the evidence of Sabine and her husband is remarkable—remarkable in thefact that the French cops chose to ignore it. I would also discover that theEnglish cops—during their investigation some years earlier—also heard sworntestimony from both Sabine and George stating that Le Van Thanh was the man inthe Fiat Uno car. Yet, the police, from that point forward, seemed to haveignored the couple as well. I also found out the English cops never got thecomments from Sabine as I did, never put the hours into the witnesses. And justas odd, the English investigation chose to keep the name of Le Van Thanh fromtheir final report There is no mention of him, except, bizarrely to say, “theother Fiat Uno owned by a French citizen living in Paris.” What’s with thesubterfuge?To be absolutely certain about matters, I asked Sabine to dictate a sketch ofthe Fiat Uno car and where the dog was seated and where the scratches and dentswere located. She did so without hesitation. It goes without saying that thereare many salient points in Sabine’s observation., points that raise questionsfor Le Van Thanh and also the cops.Just to name a few of many: 1. The positive identity by two articulate people that the driver was Le Van Thanh. 2. The dog and muzzle descriptions match the police raid and dog of Le Van Thanh. 3. The damage to the Fiat, on the same side as what would be expected after hitting the Mercedes-Benz at the merge lane. 4. The “agitation” by the driver, leaving the tunnel, driving erratically. 5. The exact time of night as the accident involving the Mercedes.Add to this the signed statement by Le Van Thanh that he replaced two rubberbumpers from his Fiat, at the time he resprayed his car from white to red. (Iobserved rubber residue on the dividing wall leading to the tunnel, at the mergelane.) So what was going on in the minds of the police, who chose to ignore sucha vital witness and her equally vital husband? And, more worrying, what happenedto the search for the truth, into how Princess Diana really died? And thecausation? And a greater understanding of the accident, as well as thetransparency associated with letting a waiting public know what really occurredon the streets of Paris on August 31, 1997?I now had a blunt realization that the French and English investigators eitherdidn’t want the facts to come out, or, due to incompetence, failed to pursue thegroundbreaking facts from Sabine and George—facts that would deliver the answersneeded to better comprehend this shocking tragedy. This made me remember all theyears that I was a task force detective, solving multiple murders and running ateam of detectives. I would labor my point, with the investigators, to take timewith witnesses and develop a rapport. Get them on the right side, relax themand, ultimately, you would be rewarded. Rush a witness and you’ll get limitedresults.Reading the pages of the English investigation I discovered that theinvestigation team became concerned as to why the French police seized Le VanThanh’s Fiat and analyzed it, then eliminated him from further inquiry. I too amconcerned! It appears the English contracted a group of global forensic expertswho reviewed the process of the French police. They came up with a startlingconclusion that upon review, the French analysis of “the Fiat Uno paint, and thedamage to the tail light area was NOT conclusive to eliminate the Fiat.”Therefore, all of a sudden, we have a forensic scandal on our hands. (You willnote they only mention taillight area, not the side of the Fiat, as per Sabineobservations of scrapes and dents along the driver’s side. More on that later.)So, based on the forensic reviewers’ comments, why was Le Van Thanh eliminated?This damming independent forensic comment came at a similar time to the Englishcoroner’s determination that Princess Diana died from “an unlawful killing.” Thecoroner went on to level blame at the driver of the Mercedes, Henri Paul andalso the cars following the Mercedes. Surely, in the absence of any soundexplanation from the driver of the Fiat Uno, that would include this driver aswell…whoever that may be.It was Sabine’s evidence that made me push to see, to meet, to force aconversation with Le Van Thanh. Now, eighteen years later, I knew I would have abattle on my hands, to first locate him and then talk to him. It was then that Itook the advice of a number of people in Paris, and sought help from the olderbrigade of the paparazzi. The old boys, the guys that were chasing Diana around,back in the days and months before her death. I would fast learn that thepaparazzi of the eighties and nineties period were an enigmatic bunch ofphotographers. Highly talented, among the best press shutterbugs in the world,most were now my age or older and a good many had made fortunes in the headydays of celebrity. Likewise, some had crashed and burned in a game that is asruthless on the photographer as it is as stressful on the celebrity. I wouldalso learn that these two creatures of fame, the paparazzi and the celebrity,need each other. Indeed, most of the time they feed off each other. Should acelebrity want to improve their popularity, their management would often tip offthe paps as to where they might be drinking or eating and how the celebritymight take their time getting in or out of a taxi, or, in the case of femalecelebs, they might wear a revealing outfit, should the paps take a few picturesthat could find their way into the magazines. Popularity: a toil for those thatache for it, and those that create it!Within a couple of days I had a line of paps ready, willing, and able to assist.Each of them would talk openly about their unusual careers, snapping pictures ofthe most interesting people on the planet. None were in awe of the celebritiesthey chased or worked with. In fact, they often thought the celebrities wereboring, self-obsessed starlets, or wannabe movie icons that would go out oftheir way to play the paparazzi game. In no time I had the home address of LeVan Thanh and what car he drove and his daily movements. Amazing! I know gooddetectives that aren’t that efficient.I headed out of Paris to a quiet little suburb with a number of houses tuckedaway in a back laneway. One house, a very big house, undergoing renovations,belonged to Le Van Thanh. A new Mercedes was parked on the driveway. I took withme a United Nations–accredited French translator to help my attempts to talk tothe onetime security guard. Then I pressed the buzzer at his gate. And pressedit again. And again. Fifteen minutes later a man walked out of the front doorand down the long driveway, strewn with weeds. It was Le Van Thanh. All of asudden my translator started to fidget, so I guessed a chat was imminent.The first thing I noticed about Le Van was that he was tiny, maybe only fivefoot four inches, or 160 cm in the metric scale. Plus, he never looked obviouslyAsian, even though he was from Vietnamese parentage. The next obvious thing washis body shape: he was pumped. Obviously a bodybuilder, he looked super fit fora man who would have been forty years of age. And he smiled, all the time.My translator got to work and explained who I was and my previous career pathand how I had investigated the Princess Diana death since a few days after ithappened, having flown to Paris from Australia. Le Van and I shook hands. Hethen opened a pair of big steel gates that barred access to the property and thethree of us stood on the driveway and I threw a few questions at the man—mostlyas to whether he would allow me to tape-record the interview or film it. He keptsmiling and shook his head; there would be no formal interview. Thiscat-and-mouse conversation went on for a few minutes until it was obvious Le Vanwas not going to entertain a formal chat. All that was left was my attempt toask about his whereabouts on the night of the accident and his car.Le Van went on to say, over and over, that he had had legal advice to not speakof that night to anyone. However, as we persevered he let it slip that he signeda police statement back in November 1997, saying that he was at work on thenight Diana died. But he had since changed his statement that he was (in fact)driving around Paris streets on that same night. And that he was about to signhis new statement—a revelation—when his own sister stepped forward and told himnot to sign the fresh statement as he could be prosecuted and sent to jail forfive years as he “refused to stop and help injured people at the scene of anaccident.”This extraordinary thirteen words almost got lost in translation, as my UNtranslator tried keeping up with Le Van. Once I fully comprehended the statementby the now-confirmed driver of the Fiat Uno, I tried desperately to get him toreiterate his comment on tape. All without success. At least I had the UNtranslator that could prove his comment. Le Van then became anxious to close offour chat and started ushering myself and my translator away from his driveway.His body intruded into my personal space and I was slowly backpedaling, and, intime, I was standing outside Le Van Thanh’s property line. The bodybuilder hadcleverly used his bulk to move an unwanted sticky-nose from his driveway! Hekept smiling as he pressed the button on his remote control and the big steelgates closed on me.Then, he was gone.The one takeaway I gained from my twenty-minute attempt to talk to Le Van wasthat not once did he ever say that he wasn’t at the accident scene. Not once didhe say that he was innocent of any involvement in the accident. Not once did hesay, “Hey, you’ve got it wrong, I have nothing to do with this,” even though Ibelieve him to be innocent of any wrongdoing. In my view he was just the wrongman at the wrong place that night when a juggernaut came hurtling down theroadway. Instead, Le Van just smiled his faint, yet supremely confident smileand stood his ground. I wanted to know why he remained silent when the evidencethat points to him was so compelling.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------It was Le Van Thanh’s final comment to me, about not helping injured people atthe scene of an accident, that really annoyed me. I had long suspected he andhis Fiat Uno were at the merge lane, ever since I tried unraveling the accidentwith Vincent Messina, back in 1997. Then it dawned on me. If I knew, the Frenchcops must absolutely know.I immediately requested an interview with the French forensic science division,and in time was granted a tour of their facility and a chat with its head offorensic paint analysis section. It was imperative that I didn’t let my cat outof the bag, and to not mention a lot about Princess Diana. More so, I would tellthem I was doing a documentary on forensic science and the fascination of beingable to detect and identify from paint samples. This was my cover story. Ineeded to stick with it.In time, I went out to the forensic facility and spent an afternoon with thehead of the unit, a policeman who had been in the allied science field for overtwenty years. I got lucky again and discovered through small talk that heconducted analysis on the Fiat Uno sedans that were being confiscated by policeback then, in an attempt to identify which Fiat Uno collided with theMercedes-Benz. Surprisingly, the policemen was happy to talk about it and wefocused a lot of my interview time on Princess Diana.As we sat opposite each other and the camera rolled I was eventually able to aska question, “Did you analyze the Fiat Uno of Le Van Thanh?” The officer statedthat he did, and explained that he focused his analysis on the rear of the caronly. This shocked me. Because I knew that there was damage along the driver’sside of the same Fiat Uno, if you believe Sabine and her husband. I was then ina precarious position. What to ask next, bearing in mind as a general interviewon motor vehicle paint identification I would be unlikely to know too much aboutthe finer points of Le Van Thanh’s car? I went for broke and asked:“Did you make an analysis or examination of the left-hand side of the red car?”What happened next disturbed me.The otherwise confident policemen had a fit of nervousness the likes that Icannot recall seeing from such a qualified person before. He set aboutfidgeting, stuttering, and scratching himself underneath his nose, on his toplip—a classic sign of my question hitting a fragile point in the policeman’smemory. The policeman’s eyes dropped and he then composed himself and returnedhis answer: that he only examined the rear area of the car. He finished off bysaying that the Le Van Thanh Fiat was “not compatible with the accident of theMercedes.”Yet, if all things are to be believed, Le Van Thanh’s car was exactly compatiblewith the accident of the Mercedes. I left the forensic facility pleased that Iwasn’t asked to leave, or told to leave the country as I was certainly askingway too many questions. In leaving I was even more determined to keep pushingthe subject of Le Van Thanh’s Fiat Uno. I instantly tapped into my paparazzifriends and sat around workshopping the problem. It was then that the mostsenior of all paps asked if I would like to read a copy of the police reportinto the investigation into the death of Princess Diana.Again, my chair started to wobble as I nearly fell off it.It turned out that the sister of my friendly pap was having an affair with oneof the key police involved in the original investigation and for a sum of onlytwo thousand Euros I could get a copy of the paperwork. It was this off-the-wallcomment that made me realize that as far as the French way of doing things,nothing surprised me anymore. I simply grabbed at the opportunity, paid over theeuros, and waited. The next day I was delivered a large canvas bag, the sort ofbag you could stash a million dollars into. Instead this time there were twothousand pages—a Euro a page—of official police- and lawyer-stamped documentsall related to the Princess Diana investigation. Funny place, Paris, I thoughtas I instantly pulled up my chair and started reading. All day and all night.By the next day I had an assortment of useful and useless information. Bearingin mind that I know what a police file is supposed to look like, this mess wasjust as expected: an unindexed, nonchronological, slapped-together mess. Butthere was no doubt to its veracity. There were official stamps on every page. Iwas shocked at the realization that the French investigative section leaked likea sieve, and such sensitive files were openly offered for reading—at a price.In short, most of what I read was pointless in getting to the truth of howPrincess Diana’s Mercedes collided with a Fiat Uno. But what I did glean wasthat the police had been barking up the wrong tree all along. They believed thecollision between the Mercedes and the Fiat was inside the tunnel, just metersfrom where the Mercedes slammed into the thirteenth pillar. This assumption waswithout any forensic or factual basis. It seems it was just a hunch by asurveying engineer who presented copious drawings to show the (wrong) point ofimpact. All a crazy and very wrong hunch. While the drawings were veryimpressive, they were pointless.It was clear from the file that the crime scene never received any realattention. This was exactly as I suspected. The police had no idea of theimportance and the relevance of the merge lane versus the speeding Mercedes. Noidea of the dynamics between the two cars and the exchange of force from theMercedes onto the tiny Fiat. Nor did they have the slightest idea that theMercedes was airborne. Worst of all, the police missed all the forensic marks,scrapes, and skids, and their entire theory was propagated on the Fiat andMercedes impacting in the tunnel. All nonsense.As I read the file, I was able to find a set of signed and stamped forensiclaboratory statements. Most bore two or more signatures, authenticating theinformation contained on the report. One such report contained four signatures,one of which was that of the senior forensic policeman I had interviewed in thepaint unit days earlier. The report dealt with the damage between the Mercedesand the unknown Fiat. In actuality, it was a definitive document outlining thefacts of the crash. In part it read, “The contact between the two vehicles wouldhave been on the front right wing of the Mercedes and the rear left panel of theFiat Uno…the rear left-hand panel of the Fiat would have been damaged in thecollision.”As I read formal explanation of where the damage would have been on the Fiat, Icouldn’t help recall what Sabine said to me, as she undertook a sketch of thedamage on the Fiat, “(on the panel) behind the driver on the left toward theback.”Here were four forensic men stating on a forensic certificate that the Fiat thatcollided with the Mercedes would have been damaged where Sabine said it was.Yet, the senior policeman who signed the certificate told me, nervously, and ina stuttered voice as he fidgeted, that he never checked Le Van Thanh’s car fordamage to the left panel on the driver’s side. He only examined the rear of thecar for damage. So, who’s telling fibs, and why? If we believe Sabine (and I do,categorically), then Le Van Thanh’s car was riddled with scratches and dentsalong the driver’s side for a thorough examination by forensic police. Scratchesand dents that Le Van Thanh’s panel-beater brother may have filled in, andcorrected, using automotive body adhesive.The forensic reports make it abundantly clear that each Fiat Uno would have beenchecked for damage on the left driver’s side of the car. So, again, why thefibs?By the time I got to the end of reading my misappropriated documents it dawnedon me: there was not one single, lone, solitary document or report on Le VanThanh. Not one. Yet, the world media were told—by the French police—that Le VanThanh was arrested in November 1997, and his car confiscated and analyzed. Thisdefies logic. I have a copy of Le Van Thanh’s own police statement, as do,probably, hundreds of journalists. Yet, there was no Le Van Thanh file in thetwo thousand pages I digested. Again, why was he not part of the public record?Police record? Who removed his file from the file I was reading?This opens the door to a greater concern. Someone, or perhaps an entire policetask force, in France and (perhaps) later in England was openly removing,omitting anything to do with Le Van Than or his Fiat Uno car. Why? There can beno mistake on this proposition, it appears to be so blatantly obvious.The more I think of it, the more I realize that perhaps my suspicions could betaken one giant step further.Could the Ministry of Justice in France be covertly involved in such anomission?Could the French government have ordered the omission? On the grounds that theydidn’t want it to be known, in history, that a French national was partlyresponsible—even though innocently—for the killing of Princess Diana?As gigantic a thought as this is, it makes sense. Is the whole sordid affair,the death of three people in a tunnel, that bad, or that serious, to warrantsuch shenanigans?Or is there another reason for constantly and persistently expunging the nameand car details of the Fiat driver from the public and police records? I longago wondered what lays between the lines of this intriguing story that we don’tknow, yet? Or are not allowed to know.CHAPTER FIFTEENAs a journalist, I had been investigating Diana’s story—in one way oranother—for years. So much of what I had discovered would sync up perfectly withwhat Colin McLaren had discovered that had been overlooked.So, we did what we had to do. We went back to Paris. We went back to confrontthe one man who had the answers. The one man who has never spoken publicly: LeVan Thanh. The French police had dismissed him as a player in the tragedy owingto an intact taillight (but if he could respray his car, he could surely replacea taillight). Operation Paget barely mentioned the Fiat, and Metropolitan PoliceCommissioner Lord Stevens claimed the driver would be impossible to track down.Yet that was precisely what we did.Colin and I went to Paris to find answers to the one of the most elusivequestions in modern-day history: why, how, and by whom Princess Diana waskilled. We were supported by Aaron Tinney, a top-notch reporter from TheNational Enquirer who had been doggedly attempting to get answers to thiselusive mystery for the previous two years and had broken ground in uncoveringnew information. We were also joined by local photojournalist Pierre Sue.Together, we journeyed to where Le Van Thanh lived, about an hour outside ofParis.By this point, we had no doubt whatsoever forensically that Princess Diana’s carwas hit by another car, seconds—a millisecond or two—before it went out ofcontrol…or was caused to go out of control. The other car has been proventhrough paint sampling to be a Fiat Uno. A huge search for Fiat Unos all aroundEurope, particularly in and around Paris, was able to identify that the car inquestion was owned by Le Van Thanh—the French national of Vietnamese ethnicity.He and his family were living in Paris; he was a security guard working inParis. His father was approached by the media back in 1997, and he admitted thathis son came home that night panicking and decided to change the color of hiscar from white to red.The painting was done sloppily and hastily. What happened for Le Van Thanh tocause him to do such a shoddy job on his little Fiat Uno, and to do itimmediately after the night Diana was killed?In the twenty-two years since Diana’s death, no private investigator orjournalist in the world had spoken to Le Van Thanh—except for Colin, albeit noton tape.Colin had forced a conversation with him in the driveway of his home. We weregoing back to that driveway now—the same home Colin had previously visited. Wasthere a reason for his reticence, other than not wanting to be known to history?Was he as innocent to the whole thing as Princess Diana herself was? She wasjust driving along in a car; her car of course was in the hands of professionalswho had made all the errors.Colin heartily agreed with me that this trip to see Le Van Thanh needed to bemade.What has been initially frustrating to McLaren is the comparatively quick andcursory way the scene of the accident was cleaned up. Then they swept up andhosed down the crime scene and opened it back up to traffic within four hours.None of this made any sense according to crime-scene principles and procedures.When Colin first analyzed the crime scene, he cast his net much wider to includea large part of the approach road. The Alma underpass is a dangerousconstruction. Just before the tunnel, an on-ramp merges from the right. Then theroad drops sharply down a hill that veers 15 degrees to the left. The Frenchpolice focused their investigation on a 60-yard section of the road inside thetunnel.Colin’s work paid off. He found new compelling evidence the police had missed intheir hurry to reopen the tunnel. When Colin tried to share his findings withthe French police, they were unreceptive. Now, he shares them with us.The dominant theory at the time—the one upon which the French police operated—isthat the paparazzi harassed the Mercedes all the way to the Alma tunnel,three-quarters of a mile away. That their camera flashes blinded the driver andmade him crash.Witnesses said they saw motorbikes pursuing the Mercedes on the chase. And yetwhen the police arrested the paparazzi after the crash, they found nophotographs of the speeding Mercedes in their cameras. How is that possible?“On the roadway, I found two parallel skid marks, just over seven meters long,”Colin mused to me. “They looked very fresh and, of course, my first question waswere they from a Mercedes-Benz? So, I measured them. I photographed them. Andthen I looked for somebody that could help me.”To find out how the paparazzi actually behaved, Colin next tracked down thefirst police officer to arrive at the crash site.He found that there were perhaps ten photographers who arrived shortly after thecrash. There is no evidence that they got in the way of the EMTs, and noevidence they caused the crash.This then points Colin to consider the lone motorcyclist with the flash…and thewhite Fiat.Colin knows that the Mercedes outran the paparazzi long before it reached theAlma underpass. Yet just outside the tunnel it is forced to brake hard. But noneof the investigations so far have explained why. His review of witnessstatements taken during the French investigation shows him that one saw whatmade the Mercedes brake so suddenly.As Colin shared with me, “What’s interesting about [the witness observations] isthat they hear the screeching of tires before the Mercedes enters the tunnel.That must be the braking that certain witnesses talked about in this area. Andalso it must be related to the seven-yard-long skid marks that I found. None ofthese witnesses saw what made the Mercedes brake so suddenly or what made itcrash. None of them saw a small white car entering the tunnel, though two peopledid see it racing out of the underpass just after the crash.”The skid marks now look very sinister. Colin reviewed statements from witnesseswho say they saw things in the tunnel that could be seen as a deliberate attack.Another witness in a vehicle some way behind the Mercedes sees something verysimilar.This other witness found by Colin, who wishes to remain anonymous, told him,“There was an intense flash of light followed by something hitting something, abang. And then screeching.”Colin does not believe that the car carrying Diana had had its brakes tamperedwith. He believes they were depressed on purpose by the driver.A motorcycle was in proximity, and there was a flash.Does this finally explain the mysterious skid marks at the top of the hill?Colin thinks it does, telling me, “I believe the Mercedes and the Fiat collided60 yards before the tunnel—where I found the skid marks. From here, using theforensic principle that every contact leaves its trace, I’ve plottedstep-by-step what happened to the car that was carrying Diana.”Colin has worked out what the Mercedes did in those missing seconds betweenleaving the paparazzi behind and its fatal end in the Alma tunnel. But what madeHenri Paul lose control of the car outside the tunnel?A light vehicle like the Fiat Uno. This is where the elusive white car entersthe frame once more. From the on-ramp on the right. Diana’s driver Henri Paulslams on the brakes. But at over 100 mph after seven yards, the ABS systemunlocks them. He tries to avoid the Fiat but clips its rear left taillight andscrapes along its side.Paul misses the bend in the road and rockets straight ahead. Directly in frontof him is a wall. What happens next is incredible. Traveling at 104 mph, the carwent over the ridge of the hill. Even if it is airborne for a second, at thatspeed, that car will cover over seventy feet. And the wall is closer than that.At the bottom on the road surface, Colin finds east-west gouges and also scallopmarks, semicircular marks, indicating a wheel rim had hit it. This right-endtire, it was the only tire that had a tear or a cut in it, probably three orfour inches long.The Mercedes hits the thirteenth pillar, then ricochets across the road andslams into the tunnel wall where it comes to rest facing the way it came. Themotorcycle disappears. Likewise, the white Fiat Uno disappears from the tunnel,leaving a host of unanswered questions and prompting a massive search for it.Then, something very telling happens. After eliminating Le Van Thanh, the Frenchauthorities stop searching for the car and its driver. And no reason is given.Initially, Colin wondered whether the reason they stopped searching is becausethey found the white Fiat they were looking for. This, however, has beenrevealed not to be the case. But if this is the situation, then why is the Fiatquickly eliminated from the investigation?This now becomes the toughest question of all. More suddenly than seemedpossible, we were ready for our confrontation in Van Tranh.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------DETECTIVE’S NOTEBOOK.DATELINE: 2019. Revisiting the Crime SceneIt would be almost four years before I returned to the scene of the crime, or,to be more correct, the Alma tunnel. Despite the time lag, I still thought ofthe sad motorcar accident often, and all its twists and turns. Even though Iobsessed over it at times, my biggest problem was that I held no officialoffice, I had no authority to investigate the incident or demand documents orfacts. I had long been an ex-cop, having resigned from my own police department,and was now busy making documentaries in the field of true crime and cold cases.My current work commitments saw me head back to Paris again in June 2019. Amedia executive in America, Dylan Howard, had read my books and was highlycomplementary on my thoroughness, my eye for investigative detail. He waspicking his own way through the death of Princess Diana, and I was impressedwith his investigative know-how and desire to cast aside the crap and find thetruth to one of the world’s great mysteries. He was also producing a podcast onthe death of Princess Diana and asked if I could play a role. He got me at “playa role.” I was on an aircraft in double-quick time. Any reason to have anotherdip at trying to unravel this enigma of a puzzle. And, besides, gumshoeing Pariswith Dylan Howard seemed like an earnest thing to do!Upon arriving in Paris, Dylan and I were introduced to our fixer, which is thename of a production assistant that runs around attending to our needs, likefinding equipment, chasing down a person that might help us, or driving us to alocation. We were blessed with a fixer who was born in and lived in Paris:Pierre.Not only did he know Paris like the back of his hand, but we would also learnthat he was once a fast-moving paparazzi photographer. More so, he was one ofthe paps that lay in wait, out front of the Ritz Hotel, trying to second-guesswhat time Princess Diana and Dodi were going to leave the Ritz, and by whatroute. Pierre had an added bonus to his background: he was part Vietnamese, byancestry. Although he had never been to Vietnam, his ethnicity niggled away atme, as one of the things Dylan and I wanted to do was try and force another chatwith the part-Vietnamese Le Van Thanh.I would learn that Pierre was part of the chase to follow Princess Diana onceshe left the Ritz. Trouble was he fell for the two-card trick and followed thedecoy car from the hotel that took he and his paps colleague (we’ll call Alain)to Dodi’s plush apartment at the high end of the Champ Elyssa, just near the Arcde Triomphe. Most security details run decoys, to throw the paps off theirscent, and this time half of the paps fell for the trick. As we know, the otherhalf chased the Mercedes from the back door of the Ritz and along the CoursAlbert to the tunnel, and the rest is history.But, with Pierre and Alain, they were oblivious to the tunnel accident as theyarrived at Dodi’s apartment and tried to work out what had happened. Then, asthey milled around, out the front of the apartment building, they noticed thebuilding security guards were acting oddly, and taking urgent calls on theirmobile phones. Pierre had the cunning to get in close to them and hear what wasbeing discussed. He heard that there had been an accident in the Alma tunnel, ashort distance away, but no one was sure if it involved Dodi and Princess Diana.The uncertainty grew as time ticked over, mainly because Dodi was supposed toarrive at his apartment with Princess Diana some thirty minutes earlier. Pierrehad been a pap a long time and didn’t hold much store for coincidences. Amissing princess and an accident nearby? The pap answer was clear. He grabbedhold of Alain and they jumped back onto their motorcycle and headed toward theAlma tunnel, the supposed site of the supposed accident.It would be forty minutes since the accident that Pierre and his colleagueparked their motorcycle at the crash scene and observed hell breaking loose inthe world of billionaires and royalty.The approach road was a sea of confused people and emergency workers trying toact unconfused. Pierre instantly set his eyes on the photographic potential andwith camera in hand ran down the approach road and to the tunnel entrance, insearch of a front-page picture. What he saw would be indelibly etched into hismind: the mangled Mercedes, twisted beyond recognition and swarming with medicsas heat and stream seeped from a ruined engine. There was a lone uniform cop atthe entrance of the tunnel who barred access to Pierre, who could just stand andwatch the end result of mayhem. Against the far tunnel wall stood seven fellowpaps, lined up in an unruly way, a cop was taking their details. Within minutesPierre had decided to retire his camera for the night; it was obvious death hadcome to pay a visit to the paparazzi and Princess Diana show.Little did Pierre register but Alain—who he last saw parking his motorcycle—washaving more of an active time back at the approach road to the tunnel. As Pierreand Alain got off their motorbike, they observed a police speed camera on atripod, mounted on the center median strip that divides the Cours Albert fastmoving roadway with the slower-moving merge lane. The camera was pointing at thecars approaching the tunnel. Both paps recall the flash of the speed cameralight, going off as cars approached and were (obviously) caught on filmspeeding. There were two uniform cops standing at the tripod as Pierre raceddown to the tunnel. Alain, unsure what tragedy lay ahead, decided to take outhis camera and photograph the two uniform cops at the speed camera. Theyappeared to be dismantling the tripod, however the pap saw the camera flash acouple more times. Then something extraordinary happened. Upon seeing Alaintaking pictures, both uniform cops ran toward the innocent paparazzi, whoreacted by fleeing. The fitter cops pounced upon him after a short chase. Theythen, without any justification, set about punching him around the face andhead, as they grabbed at his camera and film bag. What happened next defieslogic. The cops them confiscated the film footage and all Alain’s other filmrolls and camera and told the photographer to move on, which he did, thankful tobe free of the violence. At this point Pierre had returned to the area and sawhis colleague’s bloodied face and clear signs of a beating and the cops walkingaway with the speed camera and tripod, as well as Alain’s films and camera.Alain was too fearful to challenge the cops. After all, it was Paris, and copsare not lightweights.What fascinates with this vivid account is twofold. Firstly, in the days thatfollowed the accident there were many conspiracy theorists stating internationalspies were responsible for the killing of Princess Diana. To prove their wildpropositions they used an alleged—and innocuous—sighting of a strange and brightflash. Suggesting a flash was used to blind the eyes of the Henri Paul, thedrunken driver of the Mercedes. Obviously, here was the flash. On a tripod,catching speeding motorists.The second and more worrying aspect of the flash of light relates to speed. Thespeed the Mercedes was doing. My automotive engineer went to great lengths usinghis state-of-the-art computer equipment to “prove” the exact speed of theMercedes, seconds before it smashed into the thirteenth pillar. Yet, it appearsthe French cops had their own proof of speed, on the camera film inside thespeed camera, pointed at the Mercedes-Benz as it hurtled adown Cours Albert,heading for death. There could be no doubt, from what the paparazzi twins toldme, that the speed camera was working and captured at least one or more imagesof a crazed Henri Paul racing along the roadway.So, what happened to those images? And, why did the French cops want todismantle the speed camera at that exact moment? But, more troublesome, why didthey set upon Pierre’s colleague and brutally assault him before seizing all hispictures? Possibly pictures proving the existence of a working speed camera?From an evidentiary point of view, the speed camera would corroborate VincentMessina’s assessment of speed. And my own assessment was in line with Vincent’s.It would also make a mockery of the official police estimate that the Mercedeswas traveling at a speed of only 60 mph, or 100 kph. (This speed estimate wasgiven to the media some months after the accident.) All nonsense when you lookat the damage suffered by the Mercedes. A car with such horrendous damage musthave been traveling at a ridiculously fast speed. So why the absurdity of 100kph? Especially when there was photographic evidence to the contrary.The images in the speed camera never formed any part of the officialinvestigation or outcome. Why not?It was Pierre’s recollection of the speed camera calamity that made me wonder ifsome of the madcap conspiracy theorists were correct. Insofar as, did the Frenchcops play some underhanded role in the causation of death of Princess Diana andher companions? While I am not a conspiracy theorist in any shape or form, Icouldn’t help but wonder about the rationale of the two cops being caughtdismantling an active speed camera at the scene where the world’s most popularwoman had lost her life at the hands of a imbecilic Frenchman riddled with boozeand drugs. As I have said before: odd place, Paris.Another reason why the speed camera images would be telling, and help understandthe accident, must be mentioned. As the speed camera undoubtedly took image(s)of the speeding Mercedes, it would have certainly taken many images of thespeeding paparazzi on motorcycles as they too raced toward the tunnel in pursuitof their prey. They were only a short distance behind. It would have beeninteresting to view these paparazzi images and see how many motorcycles were inchase and what the paps were really up to.Were they too close to the Mercedes?Were they doing anything illegal?Were there others—unknown motorcycles or cars—in the pack of paps chasingPrincess Diana?More importantly for me, was it possible to see the slow-moving white Fiat Unoapproaching the Cours Albert merge lane. And, as police know, speed cameras area great source for catching a good photograph of the driver of a car. We willnever know!My luck in catching Le Van Thanh for a chat was still working as Dylan and Iheaded out to his house in an outer suburb of Paris. He lived in the same bighouse, with the same long driveway, and as it turns out the same weeds andrenovation materials that were scattered about. Clearly a busy man. After atouch of uncertainty, after pressing the same gate buzzer, Le Van drove up in agorgeous late model Mercedes-Benz and parked on his driveway, gates now open.As he stepped from his car I immediately noticed how much more muscular he hadgotten since we talked four years earlier. He and I shook hands again as werecalled our past chat. Pierre acted as translator this time and set aboutasking Le Van if we could talk. Le Van was disinterested. But not disinterestedenough to refrain from smiling constantly.Dylan and I tried to win over Le Van by explaining that we were not filming andhad no cameras, we just wanted to talk. Of course, I was wearing a microphoneand Le Van looked at my microphone lead and smiled. By way of softening thescene, Pierre told Le Van that I had a personal viewpoint that he (Le Van) wasinnocent, another victim in the accident that claimed many lives. Le Van Thanhsaid, “You don’t listen…there’s nothing to worry about.” He seemed mightyconfident. We persevered.I asked him why he needed to paint his car from white to red so quickly, towhich he replied, “The police report, they know why I repainted it.”When asked for an actual reason all he would say was, “When you have no moneyand you have a damaged old car, what do you do?”We knew that his bother helped him repaint the car, just after the Dianaaccident, so I figured that he was referring to his brother helping him,presumably at no cost. This dovetailed with what his father was reported to havestated, that Le Van came home and seemed worried and immediately set aboutrepainting his car, from white to red.I knew Le Van would only give me a few minutes, so I shifted the subject to hislack of assistance with the police from England, who opened their own task forceinquiry and tried to get Le Van Thanh to assist. Le Van then dropped abombshell, as he once did previously, talking to me, four years earlier. Hesaid, “You know what the French police told me? Not the same law as in France,don’t go there…don’t go there [to England]. It’s the police, which means theydon’t agree with each other.”It was this comment that shone a light on Le Van Thanh. He seemed supremelyconfident as he told us that the French police instructed him to not assist theEnglish police into their probe into the death of Princess Diana. The Frenchpolice telling a crucial witness to not assist a lawfully constructedinvestigation? I was gobsmacked. And of course Le Van, in an act of déjà vu,from four years earlier, never bothered to claim his innocence in the caraccident that killed Princess Diana. Not once did he say that we were barking upthe wrong tree.And with that the smiling Le Van Thanh pressed his remote-control button, andthe big steel gates shut us out. Just as Le Van had shut out the world from anyknowledge he might have had, to unravel one of the great mysteries of thetwentieth century.Within minutes Pierre was driving back to Paris with a silent Dylan and myselfback into the city of lovers. Not a sound was heard for at least the firstfifteen minutes as we rolled over the comments of Le Van Thanh, coupled withwhat happened to Alain at the speed camera, and the saga of the flashing light.Then, as if on que, Dylan and I turned to each other and said the exact samewords: “What the fuck are the French trying to cover up?”Collectively, we were at a loss. A loss as to why the French cops seemed to goall out to stymie any attempt to identify who was involved in an accident thatkilled Princess Diana and her companions.Or was it no accident, after all?I knew well the historical animosity that festered between the English and theFrench, pettiness that went back much further than the dark days of theswashbuckling battle of Waterloo. But, in modern times, when the world andbillions of eyes were on Paris, with newshounds picking over every facet, wouldthe French want to upend any genuine attempt to discover what happened in adirty, poorly designed, underlit tunnel that ran along the Seine, past medievalfootings, all the way out to the cheese country of Normandy?Only the French would know. I don’t. Or at least I can’t prove it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Here is the full transcript of the exchange between Le Van Than, Colin, andDylan:Translator: They’re doing a podcast and writing a book, actually, on the show,and they want to exonerate you.Le Van Thanh: Oh no, that’s okay.Translator: The idea was to exonerate you, and show that you are a victim in allthis.Le Van Thanh: But I am exonerated; I don’t care, to be honest.Translator: They were just trying to exonerate you in this story. That youdidn’t do anything; you’re really a victim (of circumstances).Le Van Thanh: Yes, but I know I didn’t do anything. That’s why I don’t need tobe exonerated, sir.Translator: Well, let me explain—they came from far away; they took the planefrom Australia to come here.Le Van Thanh: Yes, I know. Yes, but they shouldn’t have bothered.Translator: Couldn’t you just talk for a couple of minutes?Le Van Thanh: No.Translator: You have nothing to say?Le Van Thanh: Yes, I have nothing to say.Translator: No one is accusing you here, pay attention. That’s what I’m tellingyou.Le Van Thanh: No, but you don’t listen. I know, there’s nothing to worry about.Translator: It was just to exonerate you through new evidence. They just have aquestion or two to ask you. Don’t you want to answer them?Le Van Thanh: No, no.Translator: Definitely not?Le Van Thanh: Definitely not.Translator: He (Colin) says he has read all the police reports and that you areinnocent.Le Van Thanh: But people say otherwise, but that’s okay.Translator: Yes, he talked to witnesses who you saw that night; and you arecompletely innocent, and you have nothing to worry about.Le Van Thanh: I know that, sir. That’s why I don’t even need to talk to them, ifthey know. I know that. We’re all happy; we all know it. But then again, I don’tmind at all. People can think what they want.Translator: Yes, no, that’s right. But…Le Van Thanh: Because you know, you are Vietnamese, I am a Buddhist.Translator: Yes, I know.Le Van Thanh: That’s why I let them think what they want.Translator: Oh, yes.Le Van Thanh: They imagine everything they can imagine, it’s not my problem.Translator: Okay. There’s just one thing on his mind, you’re completelyinnocent, but you repainted your car. That’s what he doesn’t understand. It’sthe only thing.Le Van Thanh: Yes, it is. That was mentioned in the newspaper and so on. You canread it everywhere.Translator: But what was the story then?Le Van Thanh: I said it from the beginning.Translator: And why did you repaint it?Le Van Thanh: I will not repeat the same thing.Translator: If you have already said it, you can say it. I don’t know anythingabout it.Le Van Thanh: Last time—the people they were filming me and everything—Translator: But now you’re not being filmed, you can clearly see, you’re notbeing filmed.Le Van Thanh: No, I don’t know. I’m not looking. Everyone knows that. The policereport, they know why I repainted it.Translator: But then, why was that, what was the reason? That’s right, actuallywhat messed things up. I don’t know if…Le Van Thanh: When you have no money and you have a damaged old car, what do youdo?Translator: Okay. He just has one last thing to say to you. He’s a really greatcop. It’s not a…Translator: No, there is no problem. There were lots of things that were said tome again.Translator: We are friends, I would like to tell you something. Are youlistening? The English police is coming to see you soon. Because he, there is anEnglish policeman who told him, they want to question you. They will come to seeyou, because when they asked you to come you didn’t go.Le Van Thanh: No, but I know they will come. Several times they told me theywould come back. Because eventually they told me, “Yes, they will come.” Theywanted me to go to England.Translator: Yes, that’s right.Le Van Thanh: You know what the French police told me?Translator: No.Le Van Thanh: “It’s not the same law as in France; don’t go there.”Translator: Oh, it was the French cops who suggested that you shouldn’t go?Le Van Thanh: Don’t go there. He told me: “Not the same law as in France, don’tgo there…don’t go there (to England) it’s the police, which means they don’tagree with each other. It’s the police, which means they don’t agree with eachother, in other words.”Translator: They will come to you. He says, “If you need him, he can testifythat you are innocent. Because he’s a former police officer with a proven trackrecord.”Le Van Thanh: Don’t worry, I will receive them well.Translator: Are you going to receive them well? [laughs]Le Van Thanh: Yes, I will receive them well.Translator: Yes, yes, they are in France, of course. No, no, they can’t doanything anyway.Le Van Thanh: I will tell them the same thing I told you.CHAPTER SIXTEEN“That’s why I let them think what they want.”Of all the words spoken by Le Van Thanh during our confrontation with him, theseare the ones that most haunt me personally.Van Thanh knows he is a pawn. He knows that there are powerful forces capable ofdestroying his life. And he is not insane.In this simple line quoted above, Le Van Thanh is telling us that he cannot doother than what he has done. He must allow the public to believe what they will,because the alternative is unthinkably dangerous.Will he be killed for speaking the truth? Will his family? Will he find himselfthe victim of an “accident” just like Diana’s?All of these are clear possibilities.It is also outrageous that a man should be telling us—pleading with us,really—to understand his situation in a certain way…and to have the institutionsof the world turn a deaf ear.Even if Le Van Thanh wished to tell us the truth, he feels that he cannot.Surely this fuel demands for a new inquest to be opened on the tragic death ofPrincess Diana.That is exactly the feelings of Mohamed Al-Fayed, who through his lawyer,Michael Mansfield QC, told our investigation that if it can now be shown Le VanThanh was driving the white Fiat Uno, there is a genuine case to be made toreopen the inquest:There is a real question mark here because the French authorities wereparticularly anxious to ensure that it was blamed to the paparazzi. That’s whythey were all arrested to begin with. He (Le Van Thanh) had the car resprayed.It is very suspicious.If it’s him in the tunnel—if it’s his Fiat—whether it was an accident or whetherhe was trying to get in the way. I have no idea.The Mercedes obviously did hit the Fiat. Whether that was an accident by thedriver driving too fast into the tunnel or whether the Fiat Uno was in the wronglane, I can’t take it beyond that. I don’t know what part the Fiat Uno playedother than it obviously had a role as a vehicle that was there. But whether thedriver did this deliberately or not obviously, and what his background is, andwhy, all the rest of these other questions are in the same league as the [James]Andanson story.Witnesses have said it. It’s not contrived. That’s the concrete evidence…. WhatI’m more interested in is the sandwiching of the car. There are other driversout there that have not been traced.Likewise, former BBC royal correspondent Michael D. Cole (who after leaving theBBC, worked as director of public affairs for Harrods, and thus also as aspokesman for its owner Mohamed Al-Fayed) suggests our remarkable interview withLe Van Than should be passed to British and French authorities as part of aformal request to reopen the Diana inquest as a cold case inquiry.As a matter of urgency, this information should be conveyed to an officer of thecourt. If it is reported to the French police or the British police, then therewill be the temptation, or the possibility anyway, that somehow the informationwill be buried.But first of all, Mohamed Al-Fayed needs to know about it, and then the properauthorities need to know about it, and then, given the possibility that thisgentleman will actually make an affidavit, make a sworn statement, as to whathappened to him twenty-one years ago, nearly twenty-two years ago, then otherpeople than me can make a judgment about what to do.But it certainly is prima facie cause for a new thoroughgoing look at what wenton, because if this was going on, what else was going on?Mohamed himself declined to be interviewed but through another spokespersonwrote a letter stating:First, he [Mohamed] thanks you for giving him this opportunity to speak again onthis subject and for couching your invitation in such pleasant and sympatheticterms. Second, he hopes he may decline your invitation in a similarly polite waywithout causing offence. The fact of the matter is that Mr. Al-Fayed spends hisprecious time with his family and therefore is not minded to submit to furtherinterviews upon this very difficult subject for him and his whole family.Yet there will always be those who simply wish the matter were closed. Many feelthat opening an inquiry will do more harm than good. Those who take thisposition usually do so on the grounds that those involved have “sufferedenough.”Take for example, the words of Tiggy Legge-Bourke, nanny and companion to PrinceWilliam and his brother Prince Harry and a personal assistant to Prince Charlesbetween 1993 and 1999: “I think it’s extremely hard on both the dukes. I wisheverybody would just be quiet and let it all go to sleep,” she reluctantly saidwhen contacted for this book.One can, perhaps, not entirely fault Leggy-Bourke. After all, it is very humanto wish for unpleasant truths and disruptive secrets to simply “go away.”But that is what we cannot do.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Diana is frozen in the embers of our imaginations. She is an iconic, tormented,long-legged blonde.Like Marilyn Monroe, Diana never got to age beyond thirty-six. But twenty-oneyears after she became immortalized as a tender-faced English rose, those wholoved the princess still can’t help wondering how life would have played out forher if she had not died.In closing, it is appropriate tribute to Diana—and also an important way ofemphasizing precisely what was lost when she passed away—that we offer anaccount of what might have been. If we take things from her surviving thehorrific wreck and disregard all the negative possibilities surrounding heruntimely death, what could her life look like today? We imagine a future forDiana…one as a global human rights campaigner, lover, wife, mother of a futureking, and doting grandmother.Firstly, and to be quite abrupt about it, Diana would now bear a series of pinkscars on her body and face after surviving the wreckage in Paris’ Pont de l’Almaunderpass. Her face—perhaps the most famous in the world—would have a brightmark ribboning from the side of her left cheek to her jawline to remind her, andthe world, of how she could have been killed when she smashed her head into thefront seats of her Mercedes S280 on August 31, 1997.The gowns she wears in public would not show her cleavage, as Diana would wantto cover up the thick scar tissue stretching from the top of her neck to closeto her navel where surgeons at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital caved open herchest to massage her torn heart back to life.Her scars are a reminder of something she never wanted to dwell on: the death ofher Egyptian playboy lover Dodi. She would have spent years after the crash thatclaimed the lives of Dodi and their driver Henri Paul dwelling on what-ifs.What if they had decided not to leave the Ritz and stayed at the hotel as Dianawanted?What if she had extended her humanitarian visit to Bosnia to highlight thehorror of land mines instead of going to Paris to see Dodi?What if she had worn a seat belt in the back of the Mercedes that plunged intothe thirteenth pillar of the Pont de l’Alma tunnel?But despite spending years blaming herself for the heir’s death, Diana has bynow regained the twinkle in her eye. Much of her happiness stems from havingfound love again—and from seeing her two boys married, with her eldest Williamgiving her three grandchildren. And as she moved into the modern era, Dianawould have pared down and simplified her look—becoming a style icon like heridol Jackie Kennedy.Her makeup would be simpler—aside from the foundation she used every day tocover her facial scar—and her beautiful hair would by now be straighter, longer,and blonder.She would have reunited briefly with the heart surgeon lover who dumped herbefore she got together with Dodi. Being treated for follow-ups andconsultations after her crash with Hasnat Khan would have provided her with theperfect opportunity to see the cardiac surgeon again.But, despite Diana’s dreams, she would have realized he was right about theirromance having no future—as he wanted to remain anonymous, while she was stillthe planet’s most photographed and followed woman.By now, Diana would also have kept up a cordial relationship with MohamedAl-Fayed, after weeping with the Harrods tycoon following Dodi’s burial onAugust 31, 1997. While Mohamed continues to harp on about how the Britishestablishment killed his son, Diana has moved on and is using her fame as aforce for global change.She would still be fighting for peace in war zones and acceptance for thediseased and homeless. She would ramp up her work with children’s charities,continue to crusade for the homeless and attack difficult issues includingHIV/AIDS. She would continue those unforgettable face-to-face visits and embracethose ailing and in need, the people to whom she dedicated her life.Organizations concerned with AIDS, leprosy, land mines, homelessness, drugaddiction, and terminal illness all continue to receive huge boosts from herinvolvement.Her work for the International Campaign to Ban Landmines was posthumouslyrewarded when the campaign won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997—but had she lived,it’s a prize Diana herself could conceivably have won had time allowed her tofully mature into the force for good she so clearly was capable of being.And Diana would have found new charitable causes to help and promote. She wouldhave campaigned against Britain leaving the EU—and the referendum may have goneagainst Brexit if she had been alive to share her opinions on the matter withthe public who adored her. She would have joined #MeToo—sharing her opinions onher Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook pages.Diana would have given high-profile interviews to tell how she had been a #MeToovictim at the hands of cruel Prince Charles, who cheated on her while drivingher to bulimia and suicide attempts by berating her over her weight.And she certainly would have despised Donald Trump—joining marches against hisvisit in London.Closer to home, she could initially have found both her sons’ choices of wivesformidable. Both Kate and Meghan were nothing like her when she joined “thefirm”—whimperingly humble and scared behind her fringe and long lashes. Yet itwas Diana’s mission to modernize the royal family that led her boys to choosemodern women as wives. And Diana would soon have reveled in their choices,seeing how dramatically her influence had altered the stuffy firm she despised.Quickly, Diana would take Kate and then Meghan under her wing—advising them onhow to play the media at their own game and ignore criticism against them. Shewould have supported Harry in his plea for the press to leave Meghan alone. Shewould have told trolls not to focus on Kate’s post-baby body. And she would haveloved sitting on the floor of her apartments at Kensington Palace, with Williamand Kate’s three children crawling over her.On the other hand, if Diana had lived, William and Harry may not have felt theneed to choose Kate and Meghan as wives. Had she lived, William might havemarried someone with a showier pedigree, and with whom he had far less of abond. After all, without the ache caused by missing his mother, he would nothave needed the calm good sense and discreet loyalty of Kate quite so much.Harry is more likely to have ended up marrying an actress. He would still havebeen the “Party Prince”—scolded harshly but lovingly by his mother for dressingas a Nazi in 2005, and calling one of his Asian Army chums a “Paki” four yearslater—and being photographed partying naked in Las Vegas in 2012.Diana’s own personal life would be far from empty.Realizing she needed someone stable, it’s likely she would have got togetherwith a Silicon Valley–type tech entrepreneur due to her admiration of usingmedia for her own ends. The couple would have had children—Diana always wantedmore than two children, and yearned for a daughter.But the world’s most famous grandmother wouldn’t be perfect. After leaving theroyal family, she had already fallen into a lifestyle followed by Hollywoodcelebrities—full of hangers-on, beauticians, psychics, life coaches, andspiritualists. It’s an obsession she would have carried on.She would have had Botox and followed a beauty regime as extensive as GwynethPaltrow’s to stay looking young—but would never have gone overboard as“elegance” was always the cornerstone of her look. For a woman with a history ofbulimia, vanity was something she would never have shaken off.Surviving the 1997 crash would also have given her the philosophical outlook toforgive Camilla for stealing Charles. She would also have made up with herestranged mother Frances, before she died from brain cancer in 2004. But Dianawould have remained largely estranged from her former in-laws, Prince Philip andQueen Elizabeth, only nodding politely at them and exchanging pleasantries atsocial events and dinners.At the point of her death, Diana was said to have been ready to launch herself,fully, as her own person on the world stage. She was loved, and she knew thepower of being loved. She was inspired to use that love for good ends. Dianawould have made her own place on the world stage, to the benefit of theunfortunate people she championed.She would have adored Barack Obama, mistrusted David Cameron, giggled at NicolasSarkozy, and despised Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un.An international style icon and humanitarian ambassador, she would split hertime between homes in California, New York, and London.By 2018, the memory of Dodi would be long faded and rarely asked about ininterviews. Their summer romance of 1997 would have been as long gone as the tanshe picked up sitting lonely and reflective on the diving board of Dodi’s dad’syacht. And she would never have been spotted shopping at Harrods.Yet there is much about which we do not need to conjecture, for Diana’s impactcan still be seen as a living testament today. Diana’s missions to modernize themonarchy and improve the lives of society’s outcasts lives on through hersons—and their wives. Meghan and Kate’s new habit of shutting their own cardoors on public engagements stems from Diana’s vow to shake the stiffness out ofthe firm.As Diana once declared, “I would like a monarchy that has more contact with itspeople.” Her charity work that continues through her sons was the main way shebecame a queen of hearts.Even though she found the media’s intrusion into her personal life“intolerable,” Diana knew she could use it as a force for good to shine a lighton the causes and people who needed the attention most. She became a patron ofmore than a hundred charities, and, during her nonstop visits to hospitals,schools, and fund-raising galas, became renowned for spending hours talking topeople and listening to their stories.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Even though that fairy-tale ending is not something we can enjoy in the realworld, Diana’s legacy is still living on in our present world.Prince Harry continues to champion his mother’s cause for a worldwide ban onland mines and is now a patron of The HALO Trust—an organization dedicated toprotecting the livelihoods of those affected by war. In 2017, the Britishgovernment pledged $131 million to Prince Harry’s campaign against land mines,two decades after Diana helped bring the issue to global attention afterwandering through a live minefield in Angola in 1997.It was January 13, 1997, wearing blue jeans and a blazer, when Diana steppedinto the throbbing heat of Luanda, the capital of Angola, after an eleven-hourflight to southern Africa from the UK. The country was reeling from atwenty-year civil war that had left at least nine million mines scattered onland amid a population of ten million. Angola’s streets were populated with men,women, and children without legs, few of whom had wheelchairs or even crutches.Some 70,000 people had stepped on land mines and every 333rd citizen was anamputee—yet only a few hundred false limbs were fitted every month.Diana met sixteen-year-old Rosaline, who had lost her right leg and the baby inher womb after being blasted by a mine. Then there was seven-year-old Helena,who had gone out to get water and stepped on a mine that blew out her guts. As asaline drip kept her alive while flies buzzed around her body, Diana came to thechild and covered her with a blanket before talking softly to the child andstroking her hand.Helena, who died shortly after the visit, asked afterward about Diana, “Is shean angel?”Diana said at the time, “I’d read the statistics that Angola has the highestpercentage of amputees anywhere in the world. That one person in every 333 hadlost a limb, most of them through land mine explosions. But that hadn’t preparedme for reality.”Just after Diana’s walk through the minefield in Angola, 122 governmentsgathered in Canada to agree on a treaty banning the use of antipersonnel landmines. The Nobel committee awarded the campaign the Nobel Peace Prize, coupledwith the name of the leading American campaigner, Jody Williams.In the House of Commons, during the second reading of the Landmines Bill, in1998, the British foreign secretary, Robin Cook, paid handsome tribute to Diana,Princess of Wales, for her “immense contribution to bringing home to many of ourconstituents the human costs of land mines.”Diana was not there to hear it. She was in her grave.Harry’s HALO Trust recently called for the world to become free of the weaponsby 2025.In 2016, the British sexual health charity Terrence Higgins Trust thanked PrinceHarry when his live HIV test had a huge impact on public testing for thedisease. It was similar to the moment in April 1987, when speculation around thevirus was rife, and Diana was invited to open Britain’s first AIDS ward atMiddlesex hospital. A photograph, which made front-page news around the world,showed her shaking hands with HIV-positive patients without wearing gloves.The move publicly challenged the notion HIV/AIDS was passed from person toperson by touch and highlighted Diana’s affection and compassion for peopleliving with the disease. Gavin Hart of the National AIDS Trust said, “In ouropinion, Diana was the foremost ambassador for AIDS awareness on the planet andno one can fill her shoes in terms of the work she did.”Harry took his 2016 HIV test live on Facebook to demonstrate how easy it is.Since the test, the Terrence Higgins Trust has reported a fivefold increase inorders of the self-testing kit to 150 orders a day.Harry also created his own charity, Sentebale, founded in 2006 to help childrenliving with HIV and AIDS in Lesotho. It means “forget me not”—named in honor ofDiana.To mark the tenth anniversary of Sentebale, Harry said, “My mother died when Iwas very, very young, and I didn’t want to be in this position. Now I’m soenergized, fired up, to be lucky enough to be in a position to make adifference.”Both William and Harry were taken by the princess to see the help offered at thehomeless charity Centrepoint’s shelters and, at the age of twenty-three, Williamfollowed in his mother’s footsteps when he became patron of the good cause. Hehas also slept rough for nights with the homeless to promote the good cause andsaid, “My mother introduced that sort of area to me a long time ago. It was areal eye-opener and I am very glad she did. It has been something I have heldclose to me for a long time.”Despite relinquishing most of her charitable causes after her divorce fromPrince Charles in 1996, Diana became patron of Centrepoint in 1992 and remainedin the role until her death in 1997.Prince Harry has promoted the mental health charity Heads Together that hefounded with brother William and sister-in-law Kate by disclosing he soughtcounseling after enduring two years of “total chaos” while still struggling inhis late twenties to come to terms with the death of his mother.In a bid to help slash the stigma around talking about mental health and stopthe scourge of young male suicides, the prince—aged twelve when his mumdied—confessed he “shut down all his emotions” for almost two decades afterlosing his mother, despite his brother trying to persuade him to seek help.Harry said, “I can safely say that losing my mum at the age of twelve, andtherefore shutting down all of my emotions for the last twenty years, has had aquite serious effect on not only my personal life but my work as well.”Diana’s impact—even from beyond her grave—has been incredibly powerful.According to the Princess Diana Memorial Fund, set up in response to thedonations that poured in at the time of her death, the general public andcommunity groups donated some $44 million. By the time the Fund closed in 2012,it had awarded 727 grants to 471 organizations, and spent over $145 million oncharitable causes.In March 2013, The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge andPrince Harry took over the legal ownership of the fund, ensuring any futureincome would be donated to charities.Like Diana, and using Diana as her model, Meghan has declared her passion forhumanitarian causes, and before her marriage to serve as a UN Women’s Advocatefor Women’s Political Participation and Leadership and volunteered with theorganization, One Young World. Her biography on the royal family website reads,“These early experiences helped to shape her lifelong commitment to causes suchas social justice and women’s empowerment.”The duchess is regularly seen with Harry at charity events, and the pair wasrecently spotted in London attending a gala performance of the musical Hamiltonfor the benefit of Sentebale.It echoed Diana’s constant support for the arts and charity. Her final publicappearance before her death was on June 3, 1997, when she attended the EnglishNational Ballet’s performance of Swan Lake at the Royal Albert Hall—the story ofOdette, a tormented princess turned into a swan by an evil sorcerer’s curse.Diana also continues to be carved into a new generation’s consciousness.She will be immortalized next year with a statue, a musical, the Princess DianaLegacy Award ceremony and the Princess Diana Lecture on HIV. A statue of theprincess is being created by a sculptor whose portrait of the queen appears onUK coins.Princes William and Harry commissioned the statue of their mother in January2017. They said in a joint statement about choosing artist Ian Rank-Broadley toproduce the tribute for the grounds of Kensington Palace:It is clear the significance of her work is still felt by many in the UK andacross the world, even twenty years after her death.Ian is an extremely gifted sculptor and we know that he will create a fittingand lasting tribute to our mother. We look forward to unveiling the statue,which will allow all those who visit Kensington Palace to remember and celebrateher life and legacy.Rank-Broadley’s most recognized work is his depiction of the monarch, which hasbeen on all coins in the UK and Commonwealth since 1998. More recently, hisbronze work depicting the realities of war became the focal point of the ArmedForces Memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum, Staffordshire, when itopened in 2007.A 2019 musical cowritten by Bon Jovi keyboardist David Bryan—simply titled Diana—has explored her life to rave reviews.Shortly before her death in 1997, Diana was said to be considering a move toCalifornia, to start a new life with her sons. It’s fitting, then, the show isbeing staged in Orange County. It is being held at the Mandell Weiss Theatre,which houses La Jolla Playhouse events and is located on the campus of theUniversity of California San Diego.Set in 1981, the year Diana married Charles, the majority of the musical willfocus on Diana in her twenties, and explore her relationship with PrinceCharles, his affair with Camilla Parker Bowles and Diana’s relationship with thepress.The synopsis on La Jolla Playhouse’s website reads:It’s 1981 and the world is hungry for a royal wedding—but is the twenty-year-oldbride prepared for what comes after? Following her fairytale union, PrincessDiana faces a distant husband, an unmovable monarchy and overwhelming mediascrutiny. But her modern perspective and remarkable compassion galvanizes anation, even as it threatens the royal family’s hold on England.Diana’s Tony Award–winning director Christopher Ashley said about the writers ofthe musical, “Among my favorite longtime collaborators are Joe DiPietro andDavid Bryan. Their new musical brings to the stage one of the greatest culturalicons in modern history, and I can’t wait to share it with Playhouse audiencesnext season.”Three more major Diana events focused on her humanitarian work will also happennext year.Created in the wake of the royal feeling hounded by the press, the Diana AwardAnti-Bullying National Conference will focus on the princess’s belief in youngpeople’s potential to change the world and take place during Britain’santi-bullying week in November.The Diana Legacy Award ceremony recognized young people in May 2019 for their“extraordinary work in their local communities.” Founded in 1999 in her memory,it is now an independent charity that offers mentoring services to young peopleand campaigns against bullying.And in June 2020, the Princess Diana Lecture on HIV will be delivered inconjunction with the National AIDS Trust and the Elton John AIDS Foundation.Elton last year delivered the lecture at the Institut Français.We know that Diana leaves behind a living legacy of hope. There is copiousevidence of this fact. But one comes away, still, with a feeling of what hasbeen lost, and of what might have been.The media, the government, and—sometimes—even the royal family itself glorifiesDiana. Every biography is a hagiography. Every remembrance is flattering.But there was another Diana. A real and true person. Her power and magnetism wassuch that her vicissitudes moved governments and brought out the worst innations. Like Helen of Troy, the power of her radiance had a darker side. Itmoved men to murder. And, in the end, they killed even her.In the days and months ahead, as the McLaren investigation continues, an evenfuller, more complete portrait of Diana will—for the first time—be possible. Wewill know the full truth behind the how and why. The granular details on thefacts we know now will come even more sharply into focus.We will see her as more fully human. More touchable and relatable. More like us.We will also comprehend the horror of what it meant to have the crownfiguratively hovering above her head, like a Sword of Damocles. (A sword thatwould go from hypothetical to very real.) Diana wanted the things that mostwomen in her place would want. She wanted freedom to make her own choices. Shewanted love and excitement. And she wanted to help others whenever she could.And for this, she was killed.The glamorous circumstances that thrust her into the light and made her probablythe most famous woman in the world also became her prison. And as she foughtagainst the press of the bars, the prison grew tighter and tighter around her.Even divorce could not save her. Perhaps, in the end, nothing could have. By thetime Diana knew what was happening—and what the stakes were—run though she did,she could not outrun the world’s most powerful forces.And when we do know more, we will finally be able to appreciate her as a womanin full. To know the full truth of her story. We will understand the length andbreadth of what we done to her, and what it means for the institutions wesupposedly trust and revere.And then everything will change.To honor the memory of Diana, it has to.[../media/file10.jpg] [../media/file11.jpg]Princess Diana and boyfriend Dodi Fayed vacation in the French Riviera in July1997, just one month before their horrific death.
