"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"FOREWORD by Mark Phillips \"... with liberty and justice for all\" 4 Preamble to the United States Constitution My name is Marquart (Mark) Ewing Phillips, born May 17, 1943 in Nashville, Tennessee, I have no criminal record and I have never been adjudged insane, I am not a scholar, pr ofessional writer, or mental health physician. While I lack the official published academic credentials, I am recognized internationally by mental h ealth and law enforcement professionals as an authority on the secret science c oncerning external control of the mind. The purpose of Part I of this book is to document how this reputation was gained. This brief and highly condensed c ontribution is intended to provide an understanding of why, when, and where I embarked on a study of the most secret technology known to man: Trau ma-based mind control. Through the publication of declassified United Stat es Government documents, our U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) admits that this ancient wizard's mechanism for control is so dangerous that most in formation pertaining to it must remain Classified as TOP SECRET. As tbe employee of a DOD subcontractor with exposure to mind-control research, I was required to sign an oath of secrecy. To this day I am restricted by law from revealing certain specific information that directly pertained to my employment as, among other \"sensitive\" exposures, a U.S. DOD subcontrac tor in mind-control research. This super secret technology is an evolved system of remote human physical find psychological manipulation that has onl y recently been officially recognized by accredited mental health physicians fo r what it is, absolute mind control. My first encounter with mind-control research began in the late 1960s in Atlanta, Georgia on the Emory Universi ty campus at the Yerkes Primate Center, It was there that I learned a bout primate behavior modification-the basis for human mind control. Part I of this book is my attempt to impart an understanding of how this and other exposures would prepare me for the Challenge of a lifetime. What I witnessed, in terms of technology, at the Yerkes Primate Center and Other government sponsored research facilit ies, combined with years of personal research into this science of mind mani pulation, did not adequately prepare me for what I would be exposed to in 19 88 through an unexpected chain of events. This exposure came in the form of personal acquaintance with the human results officially entitled by DOD as, among other cryptic file titles, MK-Ultra. 1 1 have outlined this noxious introduction in hopes that the material provided by one MK-Ultra survivor, Cathy O'Brien, will incite a legitimate federal investigation of her claims. I was able to liberate MK-Ultra vict ims, Cathy O'Brien and her daughter, Kelly, from the invisible grip of this U.S. Government secret weapon of control. In the process, I also helped Cathy recover her mental and physical health. However, I have not been successf ul in enlisting the cooperation of my government to pursue the justice issue. There is a reason for this failure to obtain justice that you, the reader, NEED TO KNOW. I have been told repeatedly, \"Justice is not obtainable, For Reasons Of National Security.\" "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"This book is primarily the autobiograp hy of Cathy O'Brien, who did not volunteer for service to her country, but was used her entire life against her innate, voluntary will for perpetuati ng criminal activity by many so-called leaders within the U.S. Government. These \"treasonous leaders\" did volunteer for political \"service\" to our country. Th ey must be held accountable for their actions. Together, Cathy and I have dedicated our lives to the pursuit of justice and rehabilitation for her and Kelly. All ave nues for justice and rehabilitative relief have been blocked For Reasons Of Na tional Security. The question arises, whose security? Cathy O'Brien provides the logical answer. Perhaps after reading this work, you will inspire others to read it. Collectively, as patriots, we can make a positive difference for Cathy and Kelly, our government, and humanity, by having our voices heard. In my opinion, our great United Stales Constitution does not n eed to be amended it needs to be enforced. The grim reality we must all embrace is that there is, in human terms, no justice, and no revenge adequate to equal what these two, and many other victims of this U.S. Government secret weapon experienced. The only remaining remnant of opportunity for justice for these survivors would be derived from a public forum expose of what they experienced. What these survivors need to witness is the mass dissemination of their story and a radical, positive change in their government's mana gement of secrets. This would be an acceptable, t hough belated, substitute for justice. Their hope lies in the belief that- \"Truth lives a wretched life, but always survives a lie,\" 1 Weinstein, Harvey M., M.D., Psychiat ry And The Cia: Victims Of Mind Control American Psychiatric Press, 1990. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 Sometimes words, or groups of words, found in the English language have many definitions or meanings. Within each meaning there may be different logical and Literal perceptions of the a pplication of a given word. However, the words mind control usually conjure up a single response. This is most unfortunate due to the vast differences of perception contained within the reference. For example, if you have access to a late 1980s Random House or later Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary and reference mind control, you will notice there is a conspicuous absence of a listing. Should you go one step further and secure a college professor's teaching copy of Oxford's Companion To The Mind (Oxford Press 1987), you can reference practically anything concerning research of the mind without a reference to mind control. Perhaps you may now realize that through Rando m House, Webster and Oxford Press omissions, you are a victim of information control. Mind control is sometimes loosely defi ned as information control. This being one of many accepted ways to define the term should immediately rase questions of distrust towards your info rmation sources. Since what we think is based on what we learn, manipulation of a mind, or a nation of minds, can be accomplished through control of inform ation. With thought control being a result of information control, many avid researchers of mind sciences simply label it \"soft\" mind control. These days, we live in a world in which the continued existence of multinational businesses and governments depends upon instant com- munications. However, with consider ation to the so-called problem of. information overload, it would appear to most people that we hear and see enough to make rational decisions concerning our individual lives. Unfortunately, this is not true. What we don't know, as evidenced by mind- control atrocities, is quickly dest roying society as we have known it The answer to this problem is glar ingly apparent. We, as citizens of a supposedly free country, should not perm it our government to restrict any information that protects criminal activity under the guise of National Security. Secret knowledge equals power, with the end result being control. Therefore, despite the deliberate efforts of those persons in control of national media information management (who are not media employees), results of secret mind-control projects gone awry ha ve been leaking out for years through the media. People are literally waking up to the mind-control reality because there is an obvious lack of logical e xplanation for certain sensational news events. What really happened at Jim Jones' Jonestown and with Sirhan Sirhan, John Hinkley, and Lee Harvey Oswald? And, more importantly, why did it happen? The simple common denominator existing among these persons has been publicly slated by the media, based on research of their medical histories, is mind control. In reality, information control is but one component of mind control. Whereas \"brain washing,\" a term coined by an investigativ e journalist writing about Korean War P.O.W.s around 1951, described the results of what the Chinese regarded as thought reform. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The term brainwashing denotes to most people the destruction of a person's memory. This slang term continues to be used by the news media in place of the all encompassing term, mind control. In reality, applied brainwashing techniques are similar to those used in trauma-based behavior modification. During the past three decades, a significant number of religious groups worldwide has been cited by the mainstr eam news media as destructive cults. An emphasis on the word destructive is necessary in defining these groups as cults. Random House Dictionary defines cult as \"a particular system of religious worship\". By this definiti on, the word cult would encompass all religions. These so-called destructive cults have been publicly denounced by the news media for using brainwashing, thought reform, and mind manipulation tactics on their believers. However, there is an obvious lack of expressed concern by these same media as they fa il to address the underlying issues of mind control, the power basis for abuse. Perhaps the reporting news media can not, for some reason, publicly open the proverbial Pandora's Box. Is it plau sible then to consider that closer scrutiny, by the media and the public, of these destructive cults' leadership could reveal a solid connection to govern ment sponsored mind-control research? These arc questions that, in themselves properly addressed, would provide important answers to this social epide mic involving physical and psychological abuse. The answers that an in-depth pr ofessional investigation would provide could be the first step in resolving the rash of problems that destructive cults, serial killers, and sexual child abusers, thrust upon society. As consumers of national news media s upplied information, we continue to invent half-truths which, in this case s cenario, is seeing and hearing only what results from mass mind manipulation. Historians provide us a glimpse into the future through recorded events of the past. It appears that throughout reco rded history, man has, towards the end of each millennium, returned to a focu s on certain types of bizarre human behavior. For example, there has been in the past 150 years a resurgence of wide spread interest in the occult \"black arts\" which include satanism or Luciferian religions. These constitutional ly protected \"religions\" use trauma to control the minds of their followers. Mind-control practices within the occult groups (according to survivors adjudged credible and law enforcement officials) have been accredited with bridging the gap between applied scie nce and Shamanism. Occultism as a manner of religious expression has been around for thousands of years. Only in the last 150 years has science aggressive ly pursued the truths regarding mind manipulation hidden within the occult belief systems themselves. According Lo the Random House Dictio nary, occultism \"is the practice of alleged sciences claiming knowledge of supernatural agencies which are beyond the range of ordinary knowledge.\" Once again, it is a reminder that secret knowledge equals power. In 1971, the New York Times reporte d a story on the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and occult research, th e basis of which was gained through a collection of documents released by the U.S. Government Printing Office under the Freedom of Information Act. This was a report to Congress and clearly showed that the CIA was interested in the cause and effect clinical findings that occult religious practices have on the Black Arts practitioner's and/or the observer's mind. Of particular interest to the CIA were the heightened levels of suggestibility that certain occult ritual s produced in the minds of the "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"practitioners. Cannibalism and blood ritual s were ranked highest in the order of importance to their research. Behavioral psychology teaches us that control of human suggestibility is recognized as the fundamental building bl ock for external co ntrol of the mind. This suggestibility factor alone potentially creates a human rights legal issue when we consider constructing laws to protect people from overt or covert mind-control practices. Consideration to the human suggestibility factor could result in all forms of consumer oriented service and/or product advertising becoming illegal. Advertising and the marketing of services and/or products through communications can be justifiably defined as a type of psychological manipulation, (nought reform and/or mind manipulation which results in a form of behavior modification, A patriot fri end, Steven Jacobson, published his book entitled Mind control in America 2 in 1985, eloquently ex posing the science of mind manipulation through advertising. The basis for successfully modifying human behavior requires mind manipulation techniques that, when expertly applied through advertising media, beco me a form of \"soft\" mind control. Factoring in suggestibili ty through the tactile senses as the \"Achilles' heel\" of the human race renders everyone vulnerable to becoming, on some level, a victim of soft mind control. The controversy of what is and what is not mind control rages on among scholars in the schools of law, human ri ghts, and mental health. All lhe while the confusion of issues provides a form of legal protection for practitioners of trauma-based mind control, the only known form of remote human control that is absolute. All other forms of mind cont rol, including chemical and electronic manipulations, are considered by mind-control experts as temporary. There are laws protecting U.S. citizen s' rights to practice their religious beliefs and freedom of speech. There are no laws which specifically protect leaders of destructive cults and/or prac titioners of trauma-based mind control. However, because of the U.S. Government's use of mind control and the broad diversity of legal opinion concerning the accepted limits of free speech and religious practices, the legal loop holes for criminals employing mind-control techniques on their \"flocks\" for personal gain remain open. For every problem there exists a solution.. The formula for problem solving, rests firmly on the quality of the suppor ting research information concerning the nature of the problem. Legislating laws specifically to protect people from mind-control abuses would be futile. Practically every civilized society in- existence has some law and/or group of laws which would protect the people and punish the practitioners of mind contro l. Laws are enforced according to lawmakers' interpretations of the speci fic legal language. The lack of enforcement of laws already on the books that could protect us from mind- control abuses stems from applied legal interpretations and cover-ups of sur- vivor testimony by the CIA and National Security Agency (NSA) For Reasons Of National Security. Mind-control atrocities, if committed by anyone who could be linked to government sponsored projects, are typi cally ignored and covered up. Access to the courts by these hapless survivors is thus stonewalled by government paid so-called legal experts who receive their orders from the National Security Agency. Defining the term \"mind control\" is akin to defining the limits of the 1947 National Security Act. The basis for the solution to the National Security controversy is simple. It is kno wn as: Truth logically applied."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"It is an obvious truth that the National Security Act has been interpreted, not to guard the integrity of military secrets, but instead to protect criminal activity of the highest order.

She affectionately patted my shoulder as she listened. The words we exchanged, the room's wallpaper and furnishings, my beloved grandmother, Mamaleen. even th e taste of my tears combined with a feeling of overwhelming grief-it is ail there etched into my memory. This was the summer before I was to enter my second year of school in 1950. The first year remains a blur with cause. Life for me and my family had changed dramatically over the previous year. So radical a change that it had taken almost a year for me to realize life was not becoming any easier to live. My stut tering was getting worse. The rare moments I could speak coherently were limited to short sentences devoid of the word \"you\", and then only to my mother and grandmother. Occasionally when angry I could speak clearly, or when alone in the woods while talking or singing to trees. Apparently my frustration with oral communication due to stuttering had been intensified by a trauma I experienced the previous year. Little did I know then that this trauma would positively and negatively influence my future and the lives of others I would know for the rest of my life. On a hot and sticky Tennessee July day in 1949, my father helped boost first my mother, then me, into the saddle astride our four-year-old high-spirited \"gift horse\" Wojac. This was to be my firs t ride on the back of an animal. The excitement of the moment combined with stuttering rendered me, literally, speechless. As I recall and from photographs taken at the time, I was wearing a sweat-soaked, pale yellow cotton shirt, dark tan shorts, brown socks, and dirty tennis shoes. At six years old, I was ve ry thin and did not take up the re- maining saddle space behind my mother. With the reins in my mother's hand s, the horse responded to her polite command of \"Come on, Wojac. Giddy up.\" He began slowly walking down our driveway to the narrow crushed lime stone road beside our property. Upon reaching the gravel road, the horse turned or was guided left, momentarily disappointing me as I knew we were only going for a short ride. It was only about a quarter of a mile to the busy paved intersection that would be dangerous to cross. (Had my mother decided to go in the opposite direction, we could have ridden for a couple of miles before reaching any automobile traffic.) As quickly as the horse made the turn from our driveway onto the country road, my mother nudged his flanks with her heels. With another command of "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"\"let's go,\" the horse responded with a mild jerk of motion and he began a fast trot down the middle of the road. The horse's speed, in retrospect, was to o fast for safe travel on gravel. Not knowing this then, I was not scared until I saw the crossroads looming closer, I can hear myself half shouting \"BBBB Better slow down. MMMight BBBBe a CCar CCComming.\" Before I could enunciat e the last words, my mother began a slow sideways slide off the saddle. I c ould not see her face as she disappeared under the horse, and the reins disappeared with her. The horse bolted full speed ahead. In the blink of an eye, my rea lization of being alone in the saddle with no way to control the horse washed over me. Quickly, I tugged on his mane to no avail. It was in this instant I determined that the runaway horse was not going to stop for the crossroads. I jumped. As I recall, the fall was swift and my abrupt landing in the sharp rocks was not painful, though it seemed that my body would never stop rolling. Panicked and with the dust beginning to settle, 1 sat up, blinked the dust and sticky bloo d from my eyes, and looked about for my mother. She lay in a disorganized heap beside the road. I ran to hen The first mental impression 1 experien ced was that she was just wide-eyed dazed from her fall. Then I noticed he r eyes weren't blinking and around her head was a thick puddle of blood. Not wanting to leave her in the road for fear she would be run over, and not strong eno ugh to pick her up, I began screaming in the direction of our home in hopes that my father could hear me. Almost immediately he responded by sprinting to us\", all the while shouting, \"What happened? What happened?\" For the \"life remaining in me\" I could not answer for, as usual, I was speechless. As he knelt down to speak to my mother, he stopped mid sentence when he apparently saw her eyes in a fi xed gaze and that the back of her skull was crushed inward. Instantly he picked her up. and as we were running back to the house, he commanded my eleven-y ear-old sister to call an ambulance. To this day I cannot recall how we got to the hospital. The grisly scenes of this tragedy we re not my nightmare. It did not play over and over again in my mind, for 1 ha d dissociated from it. I had voluntarily and autogenically created a memory barrie r of this trauma. This is a normal human response. Had I been tortured after the trauma, I would not have been able to voluntarily recall either the acci dent or the torture. Hence the basis of this book. The nightmare began during the subsequent recovery year when we realized my mother would never be herself again. She had lost over a quarter of her brain when the horse stepped into her sk ull. Permanently gone was her ability to smell, taste, and hear in one ear. These were the physical handicaps she developed. Her resultant emotional c ondition would become evident to me many years later. As a child, this new awareness of my mother's condition had minimal impact on me compared to the fear I lived with, moment to moment, due to my father's chronic alcoholism. Years later my sister would follow his lead into a losing battle with the bottle. I was safe, as alcohol made me stutter. After being told so many times during my developmental years that my mother's condition was attributable to her brain damage, and that my stuttering was because my brain was not working correctly, it occurred to me at some point to learn about the brain. For y ears after the accident, 1 overheard adult conversations about my mother's brain. My curiosity peaked about the brain and the resultant invisible mind and had set the course for my life's interest. "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Somewhere in this time period, I fant asized I would learn enough about the mind and brain to help my mother and myself. As a child, my attention span was re garded as abnormal. I was considered very bright, yet my grades in school reflected something different. Although not properly diagnosed, I was most likely suffering from what is now termed Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). The handicaps of stuttering and ADD were to become my first personal improvem ent challenges once I was out in the world on my own. This \"on my own\" objective came at an early age. I was barely sixteen- years-old when I left home to begin my pursuit of ha ppiness. My first efforts resulted in total failure. However, I co uld not return to my parents' home because they were now divorced. Young, broke and rejected, I was able to determine two things. First, I must learn how to communicate if 1 were to enjoy any success in life, I went about this task methodically , first by enrolling myself into a local night college. In the classroom I studied speech, busin ess law and psychol ogy. At the library; I studied brain functions and their effect on the mind. I was not degree oriented because I could not earn enough at two j obs to attend the required classes to graduate, but my studies were slowly providing me a usable skill. Secondly, somewhere during this period of learning 1 began to realize I possessed a natural abili t y to sell. Perhaps this ability to persuade others resulted from my childhood experience of having to \"r ead people\" through their body language rather than talking with them. My first real job in sale s was so successful that my client base was reduced by my employer. I responded to this action by moving on. The Vietnam War was heat ing up and I was eligible for the draft. No longer in school, 1 knew that my number would be drawn soon. And it was. Little did 1 know that my prayers for a deferment would be answered and would afford me an exemption from military duty. I would soon be working for the Ampex Corporation and with the U.S. Department of Defense in a civilian capacity. The defense work closely associ ated me with top research scientists working in the area of primate and hu man behavior modification. Ironically, I learned more about the mind from my casu al relationships with these scientists than I did working at the various resear ch sites. The sites included teaching hospitals, state mental institutions, military bases, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) facilities, and the Yerkes Primate Center. T h e following years of my corpor ate employment in national and in- ternational sales evolved into sales and marketing management positions in an executive capacity. My personal life, in terms of loving relationships, was again in shambles but my career an d ongoing mind, brai n, human behavior research was rewarding enough to comp ensate for my lack of emotional expression. The secrets I had learned so well concerning powers of persuasion, both conscious and subliminal, had long since become a functioning part of my mind's arsenal of defensive and offensive tools of control. I resolved then and there to become a \"control freak\". Instead, my fantasy was not to learn what I could control but what was controlling me. Then, around 1986, a peer friend of mine observed that I had arrived in the perverbial \"comfon zone\" in terms of pr esenting profitable ideas for others to set upon, and advised me to go into busine ss for myself. Shortly thereafter he provided me an excellent example by resigning his six-figure executive marketing directorship and nominated me as a candidate for his replacement. "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Ironically, for the first time in my life, the nomination was rejected because I did not possess at least a master's degree in business management or communications. His assistant was given the position, and I was subsequently offered the assistant's vacated position with no hope of promotion, which of course I refused. Soon thereafter, my friend, free of his corporate golden handcuffs, established his own firm wh ich became a very successful business. Around this same time a childhood acquaintance, long since socially separated from my life, rea ppeared long enough to in troduce me to his country music entertainment friend, Alex Houston. From this introduction I learned this acquaintance, Ray Myers and his wife, Regina, are alleged pedophiles who reportedly sexually molested Cathy's daughter and their own children. It seemed that Houston was looking for someone with international business negotiating skills who could assist him in putting together a large enough sales deal to finance a manufacturing operat ion. After spending a few days of complimentary consulting time with him, I had made some rather interesting and intriguing observations about the ma n and his ideas. First of all, Houston did have a legitimate, potentially prof itable idea concerning the manufacture of an electrical capacitor device that coul d increase energy efficiency for large industrial consumers. Secondly, Houston favorably impressed me as a calculated risk-taker. Thirdly, Houston agreed to finance my production of a marketing plan for presentation to pot ential foreign buyers. And finally, Houston agreed that I would run the company as President, if and when I sold that plan, I thought. \"No problem!\" The intriguing part of this \"budding \" relationship was my awareness of Houston's propensity for dishonesty. I felt an urgent need for legal advice on how to insure contractual protection from Houston. Within days, Houston and I had conceptually and contractually agreed to start up the bus iness. I designed a logo and assigned the name UniPhayse. The contracts we entered bound both of us to our respective areas of co mmitment and was iron clad. Houston's willingness to participate in my legal protection maneuver further perplexed me, because of the obvious ''honesty type\" clauses contained in the agreement. At the time, in my mind, I had determined that if Houston could \"keep it clean\" and perform his role, we would be able lo make this company successful. If not, I owned the company lock, stock, and barrel and could still make it work. Months later, with business and mark eting plans in ray briefcase and a demonstration model of the proposed pr oduct in hand, Houston and I boarded an airplane to Hong Kong. We were me t upon arrival by a tall, well-dressed, Korean gentleman who introduced hims elf as William Yoon. He owned an international shipping company. His sh ips carried practically everything from scrap metal to Chinese silkworm missiles all over the world, Mr. Yoon, as he preferred to be cal led, in keeping with Far Eastern protocol, was interested in negotiating a joint venture company with his friends in the most populated nation on Earth, The People's Republic of China. All arrangements had been made by Mr. Y oon's staff for Houston, myself, and him to fly to Beijing the following day to begin negotiations with the Mining Ministry. After several days of exhausti ng discussions through an interpreter almost entirely between myself and the deputy director of the Chinese Mining Ministry, it appeared as thou gh we had a workable deal. An elegant banquet was ordered by our gracious Chinese hosts, and it was there I learned that the Mining Ministry was a part of the Chinese Ministry of Defense. Feelings of patriotism welled up in me for the first time in my life. I "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"was aware that China was engaged in su pplying missiles to Libya, a Middle Eastern country with whom the U.S. was in conflict. The Chinese were swapping missiles and other weapons for cheap Libyan light crude oil. The Chinese were about the only country in the world who dared defy the Reagan Administration's trade embargo. These fl eeting thoughts of being involved with the Chinese military felt treasonous to me. Although uncomfortable with the idea of a business venture with such pot ential for political disaster, I reminded myself that hundreds of other U.S. comp anies were already in China. Houston refused to discuss the subject. During the return flight from Beijing to Hong Kong, I confided my patriotic concerns to Mr. Yoon knowing that he would soon become my business partner. He eloquently relieved my f ears of potential disaster with a complicated explanation that made sense at the time. This man politely informed me that we could not lose money as he and I would have interim control over all product sales revenue ge nerated outside of China, By Chinese law for joint venture companies, 60% of all manufactured product must go outside China. Houston and I returned to Tennessee a nd I briefly met his wife, Cathy, for the first time when she greeted us at the gate. She appeared to me to be young, beautiful, very dumb, and dressed like a prostitute. I paced my walk to be several steps away from her as we headed to the baggage claim area. Within a few weeks of this visit, a delegation of Chinese electrical engineers and finance experts were flown to our Tennessee office for more negotiations and to collect technical production da ta (we held) for future manufacturing purposes. Soon after the delegation departed for China, I received a mysterious phone call from someone at the U.S. Department of State, aka the State Department. It seems someone in my Chinese delegati on had earlier been refused entry into this country due to his being identified as an international weapons supplier for terrorists. This telephone voice assured me that there were no problems that would arise and that this information wa s not to be publicized. I thanked him and assured him the information was secure. A couple of months later, my new Ho ng Kong partner, Mr. Yoon, invited me, my wife, Houston and his wife, Cathy, to come to China for the official signing of the Chinese joint venture ag reement. When I asked Houston if he and his wife would attend, he flatly replied, \"No\". He had already booked his \"act\" and could not cancel. I then offered to escort his wife and mine to China. He responded \"no\" again, that it was too far and too expensive for a pleasure trip. I was relieved because I had alr eady learned enough of the Chinese lan- guage to know our partners did not like or respect him, and Cathy's demeanor embarrassed me. I later learned that Houston's \"gig\" was to \"trance- sport\"/transport Cathy and little Kelly to the infamous Bohemian Grove for prostitution. My trip to China with all the pomp and circumstance went well as expected, even though my wife and I were in th e process of separating for a divorce. However, just before I was prepared to return to the U.S., I received some extraordinary information from a man who showed me Chinese Ministry of Defense credentials that gained my full and complete attention. This man was in possession of a file on me that could have only been gained through a thorough investigation of my past professional associations. His English skills were only strong enough to roughly, nervous ly translate some of the file's con- "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"tent. This man had photographic proof of a U.S. Department of Defense security clearance I once held. He ac knowledged that the \"Chinese knew all about me\". Thoughts of blackmail raced across my mind. These thoughts instantly disappeared when he began to voice his government's true concerns. Their concerns were about Alex Houston and his involvement with the CIA, drugs, money laundering, child prostitutio n, and the big one he saved for last, slavery. No mention of mind control was offered, although he did comment that Houston was a \"very bad man\" and his crimes were \"of the White House\". Disbelief was in order but not possible, due to the wide array of \"Eyes Only\" stamped and initialed (official) CIA lett erhead and U.S. Government documents he slowly flashed before my eyes. My first response to this \"officer\" was that Houston was too stupid and crooked to be connected to U.S. \"intelligence\". This comment was quickly countered with a gut wrenching photogr aph of Houston. He was smiling a demonic grin while apparently having anal sex with a small, very young, frightened Black boy. Later he was identified to me as being Haitian. When confronted with this horrific in formation and the apparent validity of it, I asked, \"What do you (your government) want me to do?\" He replied, \"Get rid of him, distan ce yourself from him and all of his associates\". I responded by asking him how he thought I could accomplish this task. He stated, \"Any way you choose\". I told him that regardless of what he had seen of American television concerning violen ce, the only way I knew was to force him out by purchasing his company stock, and I needed money to do it. He said, \"Give us the figure and make the arrangements. It is done.\" I had returned to Tennessee with a Chinese government contract for products valued at thirty-one million dolla rs. Stapled to it was a telex letter of credit made out to me and the comp any from Houston's bank connection the New York branch of the now infamous Bank of Credit and Commerce International (B.C.C.I.). The amount wa s one million dollars in U.S. funds. The contract was worth approximately ten million dollars in gross profit for Mr. Yoon and me. Given the charge by the Chinese to immediately discharge Houston of his duties, I knew exactly what my plan of action would have to be. Any other approach to resolving this problem coul d backfire and all would be lost. And since a former, indirect employer of mine (when I worked for Capital International Airways), the CIA, was implicated, I knew one mistake and it could cost me my life. A comforting thought prevailed and I reminded myself Houston was not only corrupt, but stupid . The CIA must not have respected him either. Otherwise why would he have had to go outside his circle of powerful perverts to recruit me for an international business deal. I drove to my office to begin the process of discovering something Houston \"must have done\" that would breach th e performance contract he and I had signed when we started the company. Houston was out of town supposedly doing one of his entertainment gigs, so I had complete, unobstructed access to all files, his included. As I had mentally predicted during the long flight from Hong Kong, the entire ferreting process took about fifteen minutes. It seemed that Houston and the old acquaintance w ho had introduced him to me were, as they say, \"selling out the back door\". I collected the shipping bills and, ironically enough, the bank deposit slip Ho uston had retained when he cashed and deposited the customer's check. There was even a letter copy where "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Houston had specifically instructed the cu stomer not to discuss his account with anyone at our company other than Hous ton himself or bis pervert friend, Ray Myers. Upon this discovery, I phoned the local Korean lawyer (whose business card I had been given by Mr. Yoon while in Hong Kong) to begin the stock transfer process. With pleasure, 1 wrote Houston's letter of resignation. With this problem in the process of being resolved, I left the office to visit an old, dear friend (now deceased) who had maintained powerful U.S. and foreign intelligence connections. I needed answers 1 could trust with my life. This \"retired\" Air Force General from the Intelligence division would be my source. The word \"slavery\" delivered in broken English by the Chinese Intelligence officer shouted in my ears during the short drive to a local hotel lobby, a comfortable place my \"spook\" pal selected for us to talk in private. In the few short minutes of the drive, I had my questions (for him) mentally noted. I wanted so much to gain the most fr om our meeting. The slavery word had triggered a dark question in my mind, blocking other constructive thought, as I was not comfortable with introducing the term mind control into my presentation. I knew 1 could speak freely about anything to this trusted friend. I wanted desperately to avoid the words mind control, not for reasons of comdemnation, but because they represented a secret I had patriotically main- tained for twenty years. After my arrival and the light chit chat of social niceties had been exchanged between us, the air changed to one of se riousness. I briefed him on my business involvement, and began a methodical line of questions concerning the file the Chinese Intelligence officer had presented on me and, especially, on Houston: shortly, my friend interrupted me in mid-sentence, smiled a toothy grin, and said, \"Flash, you're still the same, and you know damn well what I mean.\" \"Yes\", I r e p l i e d . The spook was referring to a '70s rock ballad titled \"Still the Same\" by singer Bob Segar that was assigned to me years earlier by mutual poker-playing buddies who identified with my passion for successful risk-taking. I despised gambling. My passion was \"risk management\" and poker gave me a recreational outlet for it. Although my friends each paid dearly, they soon learned my poker strategy was not so much \"card counting\" as it was my ability to read their body language. This included the micromuscle spasm responses around their eyes, Houston also lost to me at cards. The message the General was implying, roughly translated, was that I was once again \"lucky as hell\" to have survived my brief business relationship with Alex Houston. The discussion went down hill from that point directly into the dreaded arena of mind control. After several minutes of listening to details concerning a huge, invisible CIA slave trade going on world wide, the talk became more regionalized to Tennessee. I learned that Cathy and her little girl were victims of trauma-based mind control. They were slaves and the \"soul\" property of my Uncle Sam. I learned that everythi ng 1 knew in theory and application about external control of the mind was full y operational and encroaching on the private sector of society. I was growing numb. The first word s out of my dry mouth were, \"How would you spring these people out of it?\" He smiled and said, \"I wouldn't! What are you going to do with them if you did get them out?\" Before I coul d answer, he interrupted and said, \"Look, you're still the same, but nothing else is with Uncle. Now most of the CIA, "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"FBI, and the MOB (Mafia) are the same, and they're making their moves on the military.\" I responded, \"I already know that, but how do I save these two people?\" He said, \"OK. Get the mother on the phone while her handler is gone. Use the usual hang up code of dial and ri ng twice, hang up call back, ring once, hang up and call back. Tell her you're God, Give her a biblical passage. They're all Christian based programmed around here.\" Understanding that this procedure would gain Cathy's full attention, the General continued, \"She'll do anything, and I mean anything—except toast Houston—that you command her to do. Remember, God commands. Find yourself a preacher who knows the Bibl e and get a double-bind verse. You know what to do—for God's sake. And, listen, if you do this, you're on your own.\" \"Mark, this is nuts,\" he pleaded. Go to China and take them with you, Forget about this Red, While and Blue ce sspool. It'll clean up. There's lots of good guys in the inside busting their asses to stop this mess, but you're not going to save the world.\" I injected, \"No, just my ass and a couple of people who Uncle considers something other than human,\" Then we briefly chatted about some fine points of the rescue and how to legally stop Houston from taking her back. I never saw this friend again. Walking back to my car, I listened again in my mind to his haunting words. and my own life suddenly seemed like a scratched phonograph record with the needle following the same groove over and over again. The thoughts in my head were suddenly very unpatriotic - a far cry from the feelings I had expressed in China concerning Mr. Yoon's involveme nt in shipping Chinese missiles to Libya. Now I felt pure rage for what my country had become during the years after I had bowed out of doing defense work . For once my own mind seemed to be my worst enemy. Hatred for everything consumed me, I loved what my country had once represented to me, but now I was ashamed to be an American. And unbeknownst to me at the moment, soon I would be ashamed of being a male, based on Cathy and Kelly's memories. During the long, usually boring driv e to my secluded house in the wilderness southwest of Nashville, I dis tinctly recall considering the inherent risks in the formula I was given for \"ste aling\" two slaves from under the coke- filled noses of the CIA. My concerns were not of whether I could do it, but related to my friend's question of, \"What are you going to do with them?\" My thoughts went blank as I muttered to myself, \"Life is getting com- plicated again\", I then consoled myself with the old adage of \"first things first\". Within a few days, I had played God and coordinated the move of Cathy and her 8-year-old daughter, Kelly, out of Houston's house into a nearby apartment. All of this was totally unbeknownst to Houston. As instructed, I had deliberately placed the powerful coded suggestions into Cathy's mind. These commands partially bri dged her own amnestic true perceptions that Alex was going to kill her. Little did I know that the message I was provided to block Houston's former control of her was true. Cathy and Kelly seemed to me to be very disoriented and somewhat disconnected from reality. In their new, sparsely furnished kitchen, I listened quietly to Caihy excitedly explain that \"God had sent me\" to her. She \"knew\" "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"this was true because her hands seemed to automatically open her King James version of the Holy Bible to Psalm, Chapter 37, verse 37, which proclaims for the literal minded, \"Mark, the perfect man\". Not only had I placed this biblical reference by a covert suggestion in her mind while playing God on the phone, but just now in her home moments earlier, I had broken the spine on her Bible so that it would \"magically\" open to that page. She said, \"See, God did it again for you to see\". Using a deprogrammer's language trick, I replied in a \"reversed\" response, \"Well, I'll be damned. You are right. That's the only explanation left—that could explain all this\", I was anxious to change the subject so as not to risk alerting any one of her obse rvant personalities to my well contained laughter. I had been warned that programmed slaves were hyper-observant. In retrospect, I could not have had thoughts of being sacrilegious. I was and remain deeply spiritual, but my earlier years of researching religions for life's answers had turned me cynical and cold of man's interpretation of the Bible, Koran and Buddha's teachings. This at titude 1 privately harbored towards organized religions did nothing to squelch the dread I felt wash over me for that moment. In my attempt to change the subjec t from religion, I had remembered the Nazi mind-control research perfor med under Himmler's command on the families of northern European multi-gene rational Satanists. Christianity, particularly Catholicism, was Himmler's pick of the religions' litter for targeting \"Chosen Ones\" for his hideous mind-control experiments. These Chosen Ones were to be the robotic le aders of Hitler's New World Order. 1 then asked Cathy what religion she was before she met Houston. She replied, \"Mormon, but I was a good Catholic before then\". My mind swirled from that shocking revelation. 1 again quickly changed the subject and suggested we go out to di nner and discuss her new job as my assistant starting the following the day. But tonight we would discuss her divorce plans. Later that evening, I began my search for a secure phone to find someone from past associations I knew were CIA connected on an officer's level. I needed a get-well-quick formula or a cl ean mental health referral who could help these two wide-eyed unfortunates . I was informed there were none and that I knew more about \"that mind stuff\" than anyone who would talk. I returned home to find my phone ringing with an anxious Alex Houston, who had returned from a \"vacation\" at Boys Town in Nebraska, on the other end exclaiming that he was looking fo r his wife. She had \" disappeared\". I faked not knowing anything and sugges ted he come to my house the next afternoon to go over some urgent business. The next morning, I located a lawyer, for Cathy, and she ha d the divorce papers drawn up. That afternoon I had Granville Ratclift, a local Sheriff's deputy 1 partially trusted, who occasionally watched my house when I was out of town, waiting inside my house to witness and legally serve Houston with the divorce papers and his termination notice from the compan y. My last words to Houston which I recorded on tape were, \"You could get hurt if you mess with me or them. Alex, get out!\" (Now, I hope Houston li ves to be a hundred years of age.) Getting the legal jump on Houston to project Cathy reminded me that I needed to attend to my own divorce need s. My wife mutually agreed her life could be more emotionally rewarding without me. She moved to Florida and "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"set up house with her mother. We filed for a noncontested divorce. I agreed to sell the house and what remained of our joint possessions. Still unable to secure expert help fo r Cathy and Kelly, I maintained their safety by moving them into my house until it was sold. It was during this time that I was approached by a neighbor who said he had seen someone through his binoculars wearing a gun and taking pictur es of my house. Other such intrusive visits by unknown persons followed suit. I was getting real nervous. I again called on a CIA operative I knew who worked within Nashville's corrupt law enforcement elite who, days la ter, informed me to \"get my ass out of there now-someone wanted me dead!\" When I asked why, he said, \"You know damn good and well why!\" The house sold quickly and I had already decided to walk away from my company, my contracts, and the one milli on dollars on deposit as a letter of credit at B.C.C.I. in New York. Mr . Yoon came to Nashville, He purchased Houston's stock. I returned Mr. Yoon to the airport. My last words to him were, \"Farewell, friend\". He knew no thing of what was going on and I have never seen or spoken with him again. That afternoon I cleaned out my office, handed the keys to the landlord, clos ed out my personal and company bank accounts. I had become angry beyond anything I had ever experienced. In retrospect, this was the birthing process of evolution from man to patriot. I now only wanted answers to what wa s going on in my government. We needed to be safe while I searched for these answers. My next stop in this pursuit would be Las Vegas, Nevada, Once there, I met with some powerful, underworld characters I had befriended back in my aviation days at Capital International Airways while \"packaging\" gambling junkets for these characters. I felt confident that these guys would prot ect me at least until I could find out what and who Cathy knew. I was reminde d by these men that they were a part of the CIA's new funding operations. One of them flippantly remarked while chomping his Cuban cigar, \"You can't hide an egg in a hen house, fella\". My contact then coldly informed me that I had become involved in something that affected our National S ecurity. I lied to this \"wise guy\" and cryptically responded, \"Oh, well. I'll ta ke them (Cathy and Kelly) to Alaska and play like a voiceless chameleon\". In retrospect, this spontaneous lie must have worked to protect me from \"red sh ining\" myself to become the recipient of a CIA/MOB hit. Cathy and I continued to stay \"parked\" in Las Vegas for a few more days waiting to retrieve Kelly from a last min ute (suspected CIA) court ordered visit with her biological father, Wayne Cox. Later, I would learn from Kelly's medical reports that she had sp ent Christmas vacation \"in hell.\" I was now alone in my mind, scared , and going broke fast. Once again I felt totally alienated from everything and everybody in my life. At this moment, 1 began constantly reminding myself that I was doing the only thing I knew for sure was right. Realistically, I was astride the proverbial tiger and I could not get off its back and survive. 3 1991 Roman Catholic Weekly"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 THE RECLAMATION OF CATHY'S MIND \"The greatest gift anyone can give another is a good memory.\" 4 It was now the week after Christmas 1988. I was fulfilling half of my pledge to the Vegas mob. With all of our remaining personal belongings containerized and secretly in transit on a different ship, I, my \"new family\" and pets were ferry-bound for Anchorage, Alaska. The sixteen hundred mile trip through ice and snow would take about three days to complete. Unfortunately, it gave me time to think. Due to our negative cash flow situati on, realistically I knew there was no place to run or hide from the CIA. Cathy and Kelly seemed happy and believed they were safe. This was my number one priority! For me, I had to trust that my escape plan would convince interested CIA personnel that we no longer represented a threat to their security. The plan was based on an ancient psychological warfare formula developed by the Romans, I wanted to portray myself as akin to a character in a bad Reagan (western) movie and ride into the sunset never to be heard from again. Th inking to myself that where we were headed geographically, there was no sun to set, at least until spring. Late one night about mid way into our voyage, 1 sought the solitude that the outside forward deck would afford me. I was th ankful for the wind-driven sleet and snow that stung and closed my eyes and opened my mind for focused thought. At the time, 1 was psychologically \"strung out\" from a combination of rage and unbearable emotional headache. To safeguard my precious teenage son, Mason, from being hurt and/or unwittingly used as a pawn to force me to remain silent, I had virtually destroyed our father/son bond. I loved and missed him very much, and still do. The resultant emotional pain from the deception and separation seemed to be compounding within me and was consuming-my being. I had, in the course of rescuing Cathy and Kelly, shunned and insulted my son, collapsed my company, simultaneousl y orchestrated two divorces and sold all personal treasures. I worried I woul d never see my elderly mother again. Her health was deteriorating. The tailor ed clothes I wore no longer fit me, as I had lost over forty pounds and looked skeletal. Chronic insomnia, a symptom of the severe depression I secretly fe ll, was slowly driving me mad. My own short-term memory was beginning to fail. I had noticed for the first time in over thirty years that I was stuttering when enunciating certain words. I knew this was just the beginning of a long and dangerous expedition in search of answers. As I stood alone, with eyes closed, on the ship's ice-covered steel deck, a strange feeling of relief washed over me. I had somehow managed to remember from where I could draw \"emergency st rength.\" I began silently praying for inner strength and guidance through a meditation technique I'd learned years ago. Immediately, I experienced a feeling of peaceful self-assurance that we would survive to tell our story. Suddenly I became aware that the icy wi nd was freezing my face and hands. I was elated that I could feel again. Apparently I had repressed my tactile"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"senses along with my emotions. For th e first time since I learned of Cathy's and Kelly's mind-control existen ce, I felt functionally alive. I opened my eyes to discover I wasn't alone any more. A voice was coming from somewhere. I looked around and saw, crouched down and wrapped in a dark green blanket almost beside me, th e source of the voice. Again I heard, \"Hey man, you OK?\" This good man whom I later came to know and respect was Mark Demont. He was a classic exam ple of what Alaskans term a \"sour dough\". Roughly defined, a sour dough was anybody from the \"lower 48\" (states) who was disenchanted with their home and low on money. We were both sour doughs and refugees from a sick society gone mad from CIA drugs, media violence, and uncontrolled greed. I offered him a cigarette and my hand in friendship, something I had not done voluntarily in almost a year. We ag reed to stay in contact after our arrival. About two days later, we landed safely at the Juneau docks. We were told by the ferry's Captain that it was the coldest day of the decade. The ship's thermometer read a minus forty degree s fahrenheit. For me, this was an anticipated weather condition, and for Ca thy and Kelly, a physical challenge. I had spent about two years in Alaska around 1980. It was then that I helped my former boss from Capital Inte rnational Airways, George Kamats put a new carrier on line known briefly as Great Northern Airlines. I left Alaska back then, not because of the environm ent, which I loved, but due to my inability to cope with Kamats' daily tirades. This rigid fellow had a long, colorful history working for other CI A controlled airlines. Among other jobs, he had held top executive positions of authority with the infamous air support section of the U.S, Forestry Service, Air America, and Evergreen (CIA) carri- ers. Now I was back in Alaska, unemployed, and knowing I was being tracked like an animal by the same organization I had previously indirectly worked for, the Central Intelligence Agency. Having sl ept the past couple of nights, I was feeling much better and the thoughts of being tracked did not concern me. I recall having more productive things on my mind. I could not allow raw fear to become any part of my dail y diet of thought process. Cathy and 1 dedicated every possible mo ment to locate a house we could call home. We finally found a fourplex apartm ent that was inexpensive, with two bedrooms and a heated garage. We had to have a heated garage for my three beloved pet raccoons and two dogs. Our new home would never have furniture beyond a TV, two beds, and a table and chairs. This inconvenience never was discussed. We were comfortable. After settling into \"our place\" in the remote rural town of Chugiak, we immediately began doing normal things. We enrolled Kelly in a great public school, met our new neighbors, and played in the snow. All of this was being enjoyed in a traditional family way-something Cathy and Kelly had never before known. Our remaining meager resources were disappearing before my eyes. The cost of asthma medication that Kelly now required to keep her alive was over $400 per month. I strongly suspected that much of the reason for her declining health resulted from the two weeks \"in hell\" she had recently spent with alleged serial killer, Wayne Cox, She told me so, by detailing the hideous satanic rituals she and her four-year-old step br other, Jacob, had been subjected to, "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Fortunately, I had held onto my expensive Niton camera, guns, and personal jewelry items. These were the last real assets I had remaining to sell. I sold them and the proceeds paid our living expenses for five more months until Kelly's health needs and circ umstances forced us on welfare. During this five-month period, with Ke lly in school and no telephone to distract us, I began intensifying my deprogramming efforts with Cathy, Most stays, our work started the moment we returned home from taking Kelly to school. As soon as Kelly was in bed at night, after dinner and homework, we resumed our \"session\". We worked like this day and night, seven days a week, focused intensely on the deprogrammi ng process, until I would pass out from exhaustion around three o' clock in the morning. The deprogramming formula for pulling Cathy's fragmented mind back together was inherently free of prob lems. The small problems I did experience with the formula stemmed from havi ng to \"expertly\" apply it based on my educated memory of almost twenty years previous. I had no communication with any recognized authority other th an Cory Hammond to guide the initial therapy. My single greatest challenge was to learn how to control Cathy's constant state of trance as she journaled her memories. In spite of reporting to the FBI that I was a hypnotist, I knew that if the FBI and CIA could prove through my admissions 1 was using hypnosis on Cathy, her testimony in court would be worthles s. Therefore, the threat of reprisal from the CIA was averted. In fact, through my own intensive research of hypnotherapy I learned how to control Cathy's trance states. T regarded it as unhypnotizing her. Eventually I would be regarded by mental health physicians as an \"expert\" in the application of this little-used clinical tool for recovering memory. Aside from my learned deprogramming sk ill, the balance of the formula I used consisted of elements which are actually rules of ethical therapy conduct. Those therapy rules were strictly enforced, Cathy understood and agreed that, in order for her to have absolute control of her mind, she must place total trust in me and the therapy regime. 1. I maintained a constant vigil to ensu re Cathy's physical and psychological safety from all outside influences. 2. No memories could be verbalized by Cathy until after they were written by her. The only questions I could ask were history oriented and directed to Cathy's presenting personality that was recovering the memory. Those questions could only address the who, what, when, how, and where of the memory. Even if I could have know n the answers in advance, 1 could not inject. Our perceptions would have differed radically and could have created more memory barriers between personality fragments. 3. I fundamentally explained mind cont rol to Cathy and she then understood that what happened to her was not her fault. However, she understood she was becoming responsible for her actions here and now. Through therapy, she was asserting control over her own mind. 4. We devoted many hours to \"intellect ual discussions\" of Cathy's learned religious beliefs and they were \"logically\" debunked, just as if 1 were explaining how the illusions of a magician's tricks worked lo confuse reality. 5. No expression of emotion by Cathy would be permitted during the memory recovery and journaling proce ss. I never asked her \"how does that make you feel?\" This is as important as the safety issue for the rapid recovery of memories."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"6. I provided Cathy adequate food, vitamin s, water, and sleep to restore her failing physical health. 7. I taught Cathy how to view her memories on a \"mind movie screen\" rather than re-experience them through th e mind's \"virtual reality\" mechanism. 8. I instructed Cathy how to trance he rself and control the depth of her trance state through a self-hypnosis techni que (some regard as meditation). This was put in place to avoid possible cont amination and/or confusion of her memories, which might have happene d had I used a hypnotic induction technique known as guided imagery. 9. Cathy was not allowed to read books, newspapers, or magazines, to watch TV, or to discuss with Kelly anything she recalled. Cathy had experienced a lifetime of information control and therefore had minimal contamination of memory to sort through . This rule was also understood and respected by Kelly, whose memori es were beginning to surface. 10. All behavior patterns and social habits Cathy exhibited were re- examined through logical discussion between us. All pre-established behavior patterns, including daily routines, were re-scheduled or stopped completely. 11. I required her to wear a wrist watc h twenty-four hours a day, to alert me of any \"lost time\" she felt she was experiencing. Losing time, without trauma, is a strong indication that personality sw itching is occurring. Whereas being able to account for time is an indicator that recovery is occurring. The memories Cathy was recovering were horrible beyond anything I had ever heard anyone speak about, I often wo ndered if I had fallen in love with Cathy as a result of my developing the psychological malady known as the Stockholm Syndrome. Those thoughts never bothered me for I knew I had grown to love Cathy. I had heard enough horror from Cathy and Kelly to know I was now suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The symptoms of this disorder went unnoticed by Cathy and Kelly because they too were PTSDed, and had been all their lives. My own health began to deteriorate rapidly. My regained body weight began to melt away once again. I was experiencing incredible stomach pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. I was literally living on a patent medicine known to ulcer sufferers as Maalox. A \"secure\" phone call to a doctor friend in the \"lower 48\" produced the name of a local internal medicine specialist I could trust. Aware of my predicament, my physician friend made the appointment on my behalf for this doctor to prepare cer tain in-office tests. One of the tests, using a fiberoptic stomach tube, showed th at as a result of a water borne par- asite, there were holes in the walls of my stomach. He recommended emergency surgery. I replied, \"No. Ho w much longer can I live with this before surgery?\" He said, \"It depends on how well you can follow my instructions\"* \"No problem,\" I said. Within a few da ys of feeding myself intravenously and taking the prescribed medi cations, I began to recover. It was during this recovery period that I began my telephone search for answers to speed Cathy's recovery process. Again I was told by my former \"well connected\" associates that I knew it all. I was not convinced. However, my persistence soon paid off as one par ticular phone call resulted in my striking proverbial \"pay dirt\". The medical books on clandestine ex perimental research for treating dissociative disorders mysteriously ap peared \"on hold\" for me at the Eagle "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"River branch of the Anchorage Public Li brary. I was covertly alerted to pick them up on a certain day at an exact time. I complied. As I was leaving the library, a middle-aged woman with a grocery sack in her arms approached me. She asked if th e library was open. I thought this odd since I was walking out the opened libr ary entrance. My curiosity was short lived when she asked, \"Have you read any good books by Dr. Milton Erickson lately?\" I replied, \"No, but I am checking one out by (psychiatrist) Dr. William S. Kroger entitled Clinical an d Experimental Hypnosis,\" \"Oh, yes,\" she said. \"I'm a real fa n of Dr. Kroger and he is a real fan of Dr. Erickson who you know is considered the father of subliminal mind-control (theory) research. She began walking aw ay and turned, smiled and said, \"Enjoy your books and use the book, Mark.\" I assumed she was addressing me by name while referring to the book itself. I also concluded from this commen t that she was obviously the person responsible for delivering the books to the library. Soon I learned she was referring to a bookmark placed inside one of the books which provided me a desperately needed communications vehicle. Recorded on the book-mark\" was a toll free 800# with a time and date to use it. I used this 800# and many others similarly provided me for a communicat ions vehicle to covertly access the spooks' (spies) subway to information. For two more years, this method pro- vided me with telephonic guidance through a maze of mind work with Cathy. When 1 called the bookmark \"800\" number, it was answered by an electronic voice which said, in part, \"Please enter your employee number now\". I complied, using a series of numbers th at I had been previously \"assigned\" by someone who must remain anonymous be cause I do not know their identity. The next sound 1 heard was that of a phone being rung. After exactly eight rings, my call was answered by someone I did not know. He asked, \"What's the problem?\" I fell like a vacuum cleane r salesman with his foot in the door, delivering a canned sales presentation. I began nervously emphasizing my desperate need for a quicker therapy regime for Cathy. The voice asked, \"Have you read the books?\" \"Yes,\" I replied. \"But many of th e clinical terms were foreign to me.\" The voice then instructed me to go back to the library and \"pick up a psych reference book on term definitions\". I then interrupted his instruction to ask if I could speak with somebody who could make this deprogramming process go faster. He said, \"Well, there are only two deprogrammers in this country-one in Boston (Massachusetts) and the other in Phoenix (Arizona) and neither one could be of much help or be trusted with the kind of information you are getting (from Cathy).\" He hesitated, then said, \"You're going to need a referral, which I can't provide. But you know how to do it\" I asked, \"A referral for what?\" \"To have the chance to speak with a doctor who knows about this and might be of some value,\" he told me, \"OK,\" 1 said. \"Who's the doctor?\" \"Cory Hammond, out of Salt Lake City (Utah).\" \"Gees,\" 1 said. \"That's Mormon headquarters, and that was the last religious trauma base for Cathy.\" 'Yes!- the voice continued. \"But you can trust this doctor if you're careful and don't give up too much (information) on yourself. He's paranoid like all the rest (who know about mind -control atrocities) but he could be of some help. "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Oh, be alert. Everybody's watching this guy so anything you say, they (the bad guys) will know.\" \"Thank you very much,\" I replied. Somewhere in the process of finding a referral professionally acquainted with Dr. Hammond, I telephoned dissociat ive disorders specialist, Dr. Bennett Braun, a well-known and published psychiat rist in Chicago, Illinois. I learned from our conversation that he had an en tire hospital unit dedicated to therapy for people like Cathy and Kelly. I wondered at the time why his name wasn't previously provided to me for a consultation. As a result of this brief telephone encounter, I learned that Dr. Braun had a number of patients on a long waiting list for a \"bed\" within this facility. The doctor then provided me the name and telephone number of a \"friend\" he confided in, People Magazine senior investigative reporter Civia Tamarkin, Contacting this People/Time Life magazi ne reporter was to be my biggest single judgement error in th e pursuit of helpful information. I would soon learn she was indirectly responsible for nearly costing me my life, and did indirectly cost Kelly her chance for \"expert\" therapy- which is another book in itself. When I first spoke with Civia, she dropped important names like a maple tree drops leaves after a frost. I audio tape recorded practically all conversations with this seemingly well in formed source, then and in the years to follow, Civia first provided me the name and phone number of the Boston \"deprogrammer,\" an ex-Moonie programmer by the name of Steve Hassen. Next, she provided the name and phone numb er to contact Jolyn \"Jolly\" West at UCLA. Reluctantly, she gave me the referral I needed to communicate with Dr. Cory Hammond. \"The later contact being the only \"briefly helpful\" one with whom I would speak. Maximizing my PTSD impaired judgement, I telephoned programmer Steve Hassen, for advice on how to help Kelly (only), which resulted in his coming to our home in Alaska, Apparently, his agen da was to traumatize Cathy by using a well-known code to trigger her to r un for her life—from me. The method he employed could have been effective, but fortunately for Cathy and Kelly, his robotic delivery like his moral ethics was very poor. I learned that Hassen's voiced and recorded professional respect for his UCLA psychiatrist friends, Dr, West and Dr. Margaret Singer, derived fro m sinister reasons. Little did I know that Dr. West had worked for the CIA in Project MK-Ultra mind-control research for decades, it seems some of Dr. West's CIA supported research had been exposed by a Congressional investig ator of the MK-Ultra Project in the 1970s. However he survived the public scrutiny because the U.S. Government had, in essence, halted further inves tigation of him and his work under the National Security guise. His only reporte d crime was for killing an elephant with an overdose of LSD in the presence of school children. These facts I would learn after Cathy and I spoke with him by phone and subsequent disaster struck us, This too is another story in itself The phone calls between Dr. Cory Ha mmond and myself were informative and supportive. He proved himself to be the single, most valuable live information asset I would know in my que st for expert therapy advice. Later Dr. Hammond delivered to the mental health community through a symposium presentation in 1991, the whole truth as he knew it on the topic of mind control. His advisory instruction to me on a particular Erickson technique for painless, non abreactive memory recovery, called \"r evivification\", literally saved my pre- "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"dious Cathy from reliving the horrors as she remembered them. This man is my personal hero. Spring in Alaska was a very different experience from what I was ac- customed to in Tennessee. The Alaskans just refer to it as \"break-up\". In place of hearing the sounds of chirping birds, I listened to the drip noises from the ice melting off everything. The streets ha d become an ugly brown mush. For spring as normally a welc omed seasonal change, it wa s depressing to say the least. The only good news was that the days had slowly changed from darkness to warm sunlight. With this season al change, a time bomb I did not know existed began its countdown. Kelly's asthma and behavior were radically deteriorating for no apparent reason. One Friday morning in May, Cathy received a call from Kelly's school principal requesting we pick her up as soon as possible and have her examined by a doctor. The school nurse said Kell y was having a severe asthmatic attack that did not respond to the medication she had with her. We picked her up only to find that her condition seemed to imp rove miraculously at the sight of us. But this improvement would be short lived, The following Sunday, Kelly's coughing became almost constant. She had exhausted our supply of an important asthma medication which she regularly used in her respirator pump, I covertly substituted distilled water and sat with her while she struggled for her breath. Us ing an Erickson technique of guided imagery, I began telling her a story abou t a little girl who huffed and puffed and climbed a mountain. The story I told ended with the little girl reaching the top of the mountain only to be so tired that she fell asleep in a bed of wild flowers, Kelly responded by breathing normally an d actually falling into a sound asleep for a few hours, only to awaken and repeat her coughing spell. I returned to her bedside and 1 asked why she coughed. Kelly, somewhat agitated, responded, \"I have asthma\". I repeated the water substitution trick and she responded fa vorably and said, \"Dad, Wayne (the father and alleged serial killer Sa tanist) told me I was gonna' die.\" I said, \"Well, he's not a doctor\". Kelly continued, \"He really did say that over and over and over again.\" I then asked, \"When did he say this?\" \"When school's out,\" she replied. I asked, \"What do you mean?\" She robotically repeated, \"When school's out.\" \"Do you remember when Wayne said this to you?\" I asked. \"In bed,\" she continued. \"He thought I was asleep and he was talking on the phone to Alex (Houston) and then to me,\" I knew then Wayne Cox had programmed her to die using a clinical technique known as hypnosleep. Alex Houston was guiding C ox through the program. I interrupted her (as I saw she was entering a deep state of trance) and responded, \"Well, school's not out and to morrow you will be well enough to go back to school.\" As I suggested, Kelly did feel good the next morning and returned to school. This day would be her last day in Birchwood Elementary. Only a few hours passed before Cathy and I again were called, this time by the nurse who became agitated when Ca thy truthfully answered her question, \"Didn't you take her to the doctor?\" Cathy said. \"No. but we will.\" "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Later that evening, Cathy, Kelly and I would make the last of our emergency drives to seek medical help for Kelly. At Anchorage's Humana Hospital, Ca thy and I met with the young, very bright and beautiful physician, Dr. Lorrie Shepherd, who seemed perplexed and, perhaps, frightened as to Kelly's unexplainable deteriorating condition. I requested a private meeting and she complied. After about thirty minutes of my expl aining what Cathy and Kelly had been rescued from, I defined mind control for her. Learning this, Dr. Shepherd then consulted with a local female psychiatri st, Dr. Pat Patrick to evaluate Kelly, The evaluation was completed and Dr. Patrick invited Cathy, and eventually me, to her office for a consultation. This was to be Kelly's first official evaluation that indicated she suffered from Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD), 5 a serious psychological disorder re sulting from severe and repeated trauma. I then asked Dr. Patrick if she could arrange for a sexual abuse specialist to verify if Kelly had been abused. She co mplied. The results were positive. Dr. Patrick and Cathy seemed almost reliev ed at this validation. The result sickened me. Kelly's asthma stabilized at Humana and she was transferred to Charter North Psychiatric Hospital for in-hospita l care. Dr. Patrick apparently provided the best care she knew. Unfortunately it was inadequate. Months passed and the State of Alaska welfare authorities began to realise Kelly was not improving and her ineffective care costs were moun ting by thousands of dollars weekly. Dr. Patrick, Cathy, and I, with th e cooperation of the Tennessee Violent Crimes Claims Commission, began search ing for a hospital that would accept Medicaid insurance. Finally, one wa s located in Owensboro, Kentucky which advertised a specialty in working with ritually abused children. Kelly was transferred to this facility and the State of Alaska paid all the bills for her move there. Later we would learn that this elegant hospital facility was nothing more than a human warehouse that collected whatever fees the federal and state governments would pay them per child resident. A pretty place to see, but the care for Kelly would prove to be \"less than nothing\". During the summer before Kelly was tran sferred to this Kentucky hospital, and Cathy was recovering satisfactorily, I felt it was safe to leave their side so that I could find work. We desperately n eeded money to travel , to live, and to return to the \"lower 48\" with Kelly in the winter. I quickly secured a job at Alaska Business College as an interviewer of prospective students. My sales \"performan ce\" resulted in my being promoted in two weeks from an admissions represen tative to Director of Admissions. I banked as much money as possible from my earnings over the next five months to provide for our move, to be closer to Kelly. The thought of the separation agony that would exist between Cathy a nd Kelly served as a reminder of my ongoing separation from my son, whom 1 had not heard from in almost a year. Cathy, on ill advice from me, called her father and begged for some financial help for Kelly's sake. Her fa ther wired $500 to confirm our location and commented, \"This is America. Unless you come back to Michigan alone, no more money!\" It was this statemen t that triggered Cathy's repressed memories of her own tortured childh ood by this alleged pervert and slave salesman, Earl O'Brien. Soon the FBI telephoned Cathy and told he r that she needed to \"voluntarily\" conic to the Anchorage FBI office for que stioning. Upon arrival, Cathy was "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"informed that she was under federal investigation for attempting to extort money from her father. Cathy looked strangely relieved when she heard these charges. Later I would learn that she felt better knowing for sure she was not \"crazy\" or delusional and that her father did in fact do those things to her and her brothers and sisters. The FBI Agent was openly sympathetic and reportedly the DOJ \"inspired\" investigation was subsequently droppe d upon his recommendation. This agent went on to secure a cash donation through his Mormon church that enabled us to leave his jurisdiction. It is noteworthy that during this same time; through another special agent at the Anchorage FBI office, 1 was interr ogated for \"what I knew\" regarding an unrelated crime involving my ex-wife and her lawyer boss in Florida. I knew nothing, I now know that the FBI was, in effect, attempting to destroy my credibility as a dvocate for Cathy and Kelly through their investigation efforts of me. Their case against my ex-wife and her lawyer was solved, and her lawyer accomplice was convicted of first degree murder. My ex-wife became a state's witness and was acquitted. However, days later I would \"see\" my ex-wife being arrested and processed on the popular national television show \"Unsolved Mysteries\". That u nfortunate case involved only one homic ide and made the national news for weeks to come. In contrast, Calhy's testimony, with proofs provided FBI officia1s, was filed and deliberately covered up—For Reasons of National Security. The fall season in Alaska was now quickly giving in to winter and the \"termination dust\" (snow) was re-coating the surrounding mountains. The air was definitely becoming nippy. The chan ge of seasons signaled another change within my new family. Kelly was going to be transferred soon to the Kentucky Valley Institute of Psychiatry (V.I.P.). Cathy and I had been saving every dollar I could earn during my brief tenure at Alaska Business College in preparation for our move back to the \"lower 48\". I realized now that Cathy had gone into a state of recovery known as \"fusion\". She had long since stopped sw itching personalities and had become a beautiful, intelligent, and logical lady. She was no longer susceptible to anyone triggering her to go against or away from me. She continued to journal her traumatic memories and was professionally adjudged stable. The passage on ships and ferries out of Anchorage to Seattle was booked solid for months ahead. They would onl y accept freight and/or vehicles. 1 purchased two, one-way tickets on Alas ka Airlines and brought our family car, a 1976 AMC Pacer, and remaining belongings to the Anchorage docks for shipment. Suddenly, as we packed our bags and were ready to board our flight, a nearby volcano erupted and halted all air tr affic in or out of Anchorage for the following two weeks. We waited anxiously for the airport to reopen. We would leave first and Kelly and her nurs e would soon follow. This would be the first step of what would be an e ndless journey in our pursuit of justice. 4 Mark Phillips' motto 5 The term Multiple personality Di sorder (MPD) Is now clinically referred to by mental health professionals as Disso ciative Identity Disorder (DID). "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 TRUTH AND CONSEQUENCES JUST US PURSUED AND JUSTICE DENIED Our much anticipated arrival into the Seattle (Washington) International Airport terminal heralded a new beginning. Cathy appeared to be openly optimistic that perhaps, at long last, Kelly would soon have her chance for recovery. Privately, I felt much less hopeful, I knew from past personal experiences and through my \"insider s ources\" that mental health physicians from the private sector of society had little acquaintance with secret U.S. Government mind-control research. The only mind-control informauon these doctors had access to for the most pa rt was from the hysterical comments supplied them by their troubled patients . Hysteria, in this case, as a symptom of misinformation is highly contagious, and therefore spread throughout the mental health profession. Many practitioners displayed symptoms of the \"ostrich syndrome\" to me, their peers, and patients through fear and chronic denial. It was 1990, the beginning of the last decade of this century and the millennium, and most mental health physicians remained in a state of denial concerning the existence of mind control. Mental health as a science is barely one-hundred years of age. Truly an indus try in its infancy in relation to the other recognized healing arts. Due to mental health's infancy and the fa ct that it is rooted in the archaic, mystical theories of Jung and Freud, combined with the non-availability of government controlled research information, the term \"mental health\" is viewed by patients and doctors alike as an oxym oron. Patients I have interviewed who suffer from dissociative disorders frequentl y refer to the profession as \"mental hell,\" and their well-intentioned provider as \"the rapist\". Unfortunately for all parties concerned, in many reported instances these cruel labels are consistent with the quality of the care provided. Wh ereas I strongly support, in concept, the healing arts existing in the fields of mental health that could be applied in the treatment of mind-control patients, I cannot foresee their application in meeting the needs of these pa tients without some radical changes in our National Security Act. Afound 1970, I recall witnes sing a \"mild\" case in point. 1 was overseeing the video taping of a TOP SECRET psychiatric experiment involving a young man who had suffered brain damage resulting from some type of severe head trauma. This patient was ambulato ry. He could not remember anything, express himself, or for that matter, think. He was not brain dead. He was mind dead. Through the application of a combination of experimental drugs and hi-tech electronic technology involv ing harmonics, his brain was being \"retrained\" to permit constructed thou ght processes to commence. The brain scar tissue that was inhibiting his ability to think was being chemically and electronically by-passed. I equated this experimental procedure to the \"hot wiring\" of an ignition switch of an automobile to preclude the use of a key. The extraordinary procedure and subsequent results of this experimental therapy was meticulously recorded. The record, tape, and doctor notes were dropped into a security envelope and were taken by courier to Fort George Meade, Maryland. "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"What made this case so memorable was the event that immediately followed. I overheard the experiment's attending physician complaining bitterly to his nurse colleague that \"his\" patient in an adjoining ward, who was not a \"DOD guinea pig,\" through application of this method, could \"probably recover\". The doctor's complaint addressed his being pr ohibited from applying state-of-the-art treatment for his patient by virtue of his DOD oath of secrecy. This doctor was frustrated at being forced to serve tw o masters. The DOD being one master held control over his career through his me dical license, liability insurance, and the secrecy oath he had signed. The s econd master was the doctor's own moral and ethical standards, supported by th e Hippocratic Oath he had signed upon becoming a physician. Thus without benefit of the voluminous DOD research findings and technology developments, the medical field of mental health is in its learning curve for establishing models to provide pa tients state-of-the-art care. In other words, mental health providers themse lves are quickly becoming the second group of mind/information control victims. The mental health profession is in a sa te of crisis and his arrived at the proverbial crossroads of failure and success. The road to success through the application of available technologies appears to be blocked FOR REASONS OF NATIONAL SECURITY. As a direct result of DOD manageme nt of mind research secrets and the resulting federal information containment practices, mental health providers are on the defensive with their patients, the courts, and more recently with certain special interest action groups. These gr oups are attacking the mental health professional as a target for destruction. Well-funded organizations with very questionable agendas, such as the Fa lse Memory Foundation (FMF) and the Church of Scientology, have publicly denounced mental health as a profession. The Church of Scientology has emerged as the apparent leader in publicly denouncing the mental health profession. Thr ough the church's Washington, D.C. based \"human rights\" lobby group, it has launched a massive negative propaganda campaign accompanied by nume rous lawsuits against ethical drug companies and mental health providers. Scientologists believe their church 's ffounder, L. Ron Hubbard, has discovered a cure-all for mental illn ess through behavior modification. Hubbard, a successful science fiction writer, allegedly acquired knowledge of subliminal mind control through his military service with U.S. Navy Intelligence. He named his behavioral modification program Dianetics after his first wife, Diane. The False Memory Foundation is a lobby group which is primarily utilized by persons charged with sexual abuse. The FMF is desperately attempting to develop legislation that restricts thera py for persons suffering from dissociative disorders as a result of trauma. This or ganization's stated beliefs include that repressed memory is a myth. FMF has found the mental health profession's Achilles' heel. To date, the model for developing an effective therapy regime for dis- sociative disorders (which are as a result of repeated trauma) has not been published by either the American Psychiatric Association or the American Psychological Association. The difficulty in developing a model is due to a number of factors. The primary factor involves national security secrets concerning classified mind-control research. "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"In the present climate, referring mind-control victims to mental health professionals for treatment would be tantamount to subjecting a patient needing delicate surgery to a surgeon who was blind-folded and hand-cuffed. The knowledge of these conditions produced the private opinion I withheld from Cathy when she professed optimism for Kelly's latest recovery opportunity. Nevertheless, Cathy was nearing complete recovery and we both recognized we were doing all we could a( the mo ment to provide for Kelly's needs. Perhaps identifying \"who\" within our government is interested in withholding vital medical research find ings and technologies information from the mental health profession could provide a foundation of understanding. From my personal experiences while work ing for Capital International Airways. I formed a strong opinion that addresse s this question. However, the answer that mirrors my perception was later eloquently provided by a Washington. D.C. news correspondent and journalis t, Linda Hunt, in her book Secret Agenda. The historical basis for this book are the declassified DOD documents identifying Project Paperclip as being th e secret importation/re location of Nazr and Fascist scientist into the United States over a forty-year period. These brilliant criminal scientists we re primarily focused on two areas of research, rockets and the mind. They were placed in positions of authority in, among others, prestigious universities, colleges, industries, and NASA. Over the years, these imported criminals have directly influenced our society with advanced rocket technologies and min d-control applications through U.S. Government sponsored research. Accord ing to Secret Agenda, Nazism, as a philosophy and form of government, is al ive and destroying our country, in part, as a result of Project Paperclip. I can attest to this statement from personal knowledge gained during my employment at Capital international Airways, which is named as one of the primary transporters for Project Paperclip. These were background facts for some of the thoughts that rushed through my mind on our Jong drive from Seattle to the Southeastern U.S. I was anxious to discover the end results of my teleph one campaign in the pursuit of justice I had waged while in Alaska. Our first destination would be Huntsville, Alabama. This southern U.S. city is famous for its tourism centerpiece, the NASA owned U.S. Space and Rocket Center. The town also boasts of being home to more Pentagon, black-budget, U.S. dollars per capita than anyplace in America. Cathy harbors a very different opinion of this town, its police force, and the NASA research facility. For Cathy and Kelly, Huntsville had been a place they were regularly taken to by Alex Houston for hi-tech torture and the production of child and adult pornography films. This trip to Huntsville would be differen t for Cathy, except for one aspect of her previous experiences. Both she and I would receive our first threat to our lives in our pursuit of justice from law en forcement. This was surprising to me and \"normal\" for Cathy. The lead-up to this threat began with my phone call to a Huntsville based legal aid group known as the National A ssociation of Child Advocates. This organization publicized that it was formed through the leadership efforts of the local district attorney 'Bud' Crammer, w ho is known to his constituents as \"Gun Ban Bud\". After supplying this advocacy center with Cathy's recollections of her past experiences in Huntsville, we were contacted by two Huntsville City "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Police Department \"vice\" detectives. Their names were Jeff Bennet and Chuck Crabtree. Upon our arrival into Huntsville, these two vice cops escorted us and our trailer to a local apartment used for staging drug buys. The place was furnished, complete with audio and vi deo bugs throughout every room. When I asked Bennet if the \"place was bugged,\" he flatly denied it. From this lie I knew with certainty that Cathy and I were there to be specimens for whomever to study, I knew \"who,\" and we gave them our best performance to mislead them . This action probably saved our lives. After weeks of \"delays,\" the two vice cops sat down with Cathy and me for discussion. She supplied them a myriad of testimony including detailed physical descriptions of two partic ular perpetrators, their names, and location maps of where they lived and allegedly produced child and adult pornography. The two perpetrators, themselves Hunt sville policemen, were al so helpful assets in the campaign for electing District Attorn ey Bud Crammer. Their names were Audie Majors and Sergeant Frank Crowell. After Cathy had exhausted all of her recollections, Crabtree and Bennet ordered us to \"leave Huntsville now whil e we were still alive, and shut up if we intended to stay that way!\" Later, Cathy and I would learn that Cr abtree and Bennct had notified every law enforcement officer in over five states to whom we had provided information, They reported that we we re a pair of \"professional con artist criminals\". Perhaps they were able to accomplish this discrediting tactic as a result of police reports we filed in othe r states, which included a reference to our \"bud experience\" with the Huntsville Police Department. In addition, the Nashville office of the FBI was respon sible for perpetrating Crabtree's and Bennet's discrediting lies. This FBI action ceased after resident-agent-in-charge Ben Purser was told by a friendly district attorney that I now could prove the identity and prosecute those responsible for the character assassination. The harassmet stopped, It is interesting to note that 'Bud' Crammer would in less than a year, be elected to Congress. Within months after his election, Bud was rewarded for years of alleged containment practices. Allegedly Bud has been covering up investigations for the intelligence co mmunity, DOD, and of course his number one financial supporter, NASA. The wife of an Atlanta, Georgia phys ician, Ms. Faye Yeager, did however survive Bud's wrath in court. Her \"c rime\" was advocating for and protecting a child who had been horribly abused. Th is courageous lady had her day in court and won. Now she has filed a counter- suit in Federal court. Reeling from Bud's \"second hand\" threats to our lives, we returned to Nashville, Here we learned that the Kentucky V.I.P. hospital administration had suddenly declared Kelly's State of Alaska medical records \"t o be in error\". V.I.P. said she was \"fine!\" This statement was supplemented by \"you best come here now and pick her up or we'll give her to Kentucky Ch ild Services and they will find adoptive parents.\" This was a terrifying development since Kelly could not function outside a restrictive environment. She had been de clared suicidal and homicidal by three attending physicians and/or therapists. Cathy and I were homeless. We brought Kelly back to Tennessee where she, Cathy and I stayed in my mother's tiny two-bedroom home. This living arrangement would not last. Kelly's asthma (program), destined to separate her from her mother, returned within 48 "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"hours. We rushed her, gasping for breath, to Vanderbilt Hospital in Nashville for emergency treatment. Again Kelly's condition worsened to the extremely critical point, then returned to normal . Her attending doctor thought he had seen a real miracle until he learned about mind control. Vanderbilt Hospital physicians who re viewed Kelly's past medical and psychiatric records recommended that she be moved to the worst child warehouse we've seen so far, Croc ket/Cumberland House, the \"home for broken butterflies\" (see photo). Becau se Cathy and I were both unemployed and Kelly only had Medicaid insurance, the State of Tennessee demanded temporary custody. Their demands for custody were legally legitimate and morally equated to extortion for they had no intentions of seeking expert therapy for Kelly. Through a lengthy two-year court pro ceeding, with five lawyers opposing Cathy, we had a partial victory, Kelly was transferred to Charter Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee where again she di d not receive MPD/DID therapy, but for the first time did receive genuine empathy from a social worker, Abbott Jordan. During this period, my life and liberty was threatened by the Nashville Metro Police Department. This verbal death threat was delivered by Metro Homicide Captain Mickey Miller and ec hoed by his friend and subordinate Lt. Tommy Jacobs. Miller said, \"You best forget this woman; walk away from all this now before your health changes. \" Jacobs said, \"There's nothing wrong with that kid that her father (Cox) can't fix. She just has allergies. You'd best forget you ever heard of either one of them.\" I have all this conversation on audio tape. Within a few months of these threats ca me others threatening both our lives and liberty from every branch of la w enforcement within the State of Tennessee. This included the Nashville o ffice of the FBI. The latter was in the form of a \"clerical mistake\" on the part of the FBI that was to be a \"frame up\" for my supposedly threatening the Presid ent of the United States, George Bush. This charge was totally groundless and wa s subsequently dropped, but only after I secured a lawyer It was now 1991, and Cathy and I had determined that we must proceed with \"phase two\" of our pursuit of ju stice through a well organized information dissemination campaign. The funding for this project would indirectly come from the assistance of Bill Ross who also provided constant moral support, Cathy and I have always fell uncomfor table exposing gentle persons like Bill Ross to such horrific information as pe rtains to trauma-based mind control. However, we have learned over the years through our public speaking engagements and consultations with ph ysicians and others that, generally speaking, people appreciate knowing WHY they are no longer \"at the top of the food chain,\" Bill Ross like hundreds of others never gave up hope that we would live to tell our story. Five years have passed since we retu rned from Alaska. The lessons learned through this trail-blazing effort in our pursuit of justice should never be taught to anyone. No person should have to experience the heartache, desperation, and grinding poverty that Cathy, Kelly, and I have had to live with- During the winding down portion of our information dissemination campaign, Cathy approached me with an idea she thought could help us win public support. She had repeatedly commented that she wanted to rescue Seidina 'Dina' Reed, daughter of acto r/singer Jerry Reed of Smokey And The "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Bandit fame. According to Cathy, she had been used repeatedly in pornography productions with Seidina over the years and had bonded with this once beautiful woman. Seidina's husband, David Rorick, ak a Dave Roe, was then her alleged sadistic handler. It is noteworthy that Roe allegedly received his training on how to maintain a slave, using specific tortures, from Alex Houston. Roe lived and reportedly loved, with Houston before he met Seidina. Cathy and I naively believed at the time that Jerry Reed was not involved in his daughter's enslavement as was Cathy's father. Furthermore, we were convinced that Jerry Reed, with his numerous connections into politics and the entertainment industry could be a powerful ally. This was not to be. I rescued Seidina and in minutes after the rescue, she began talking, but not until I had discussed my plan in person wi th her famous father and his agent at a Brentwood, Tennessee restaurant. Reed had more Chan enough time to warn Roe that I was armed and on my way to his house. All evidences disappeared. Years later a U.S. Customs Enforcemen t officer informed me that I had \"somedoby\" connected to Reed, possibly Reed himself, suggesting \"I might be blackmailing him.\" This \"clean\" custom s officer knew I had rescued Seidina from Roe's enslavement and that I had au dio taped all meetings with Seidina, Jerry Keed, and his wife, Prissy. He was openly concerned for my safety and that Reed was lying so as to frighten me away. Within two months after the rescue, Seidina and her mother filed criminal charges, including sexual child abuse (of Seidina's four-year-old son) against Roe. A \"spook informant\" working with in the Nashville District Attorney's office alerted me to these charges and the anticipated outcome. No action was taken FOR REASONS OF NATIONAL SECURITY. Seidina had been prostituted to, among many others, heads of state, and to the Arabian Ambassador to the U.S., Pr ince Bandar Bin Sultan. According to an involved witnesses of one of he r encounters with Bandar (a friend of George Bush) she was one of his favorite slaves. We've never heard from Seidina or any member of her family sinc e the rescue. This trek through hell in our pursuit of justice taught nothing to Ca thy that she had not already been told by her abusers. For me, I learned the hard way that our Constitution was only a beautiful plan that had been stolen , plundered, and replaced FOR REASONS OF NATIONAL SECURITY. Today, Cathy, Kelly, I and all true patriots stand at the proverbial crossroads of revolution or evolution. Through armed revolution, we patriots will perish and the emergence of a totally government controlled society will herald in another period of \"dark ag es\". As a proud gun owner, armed with inside knowledge, I know we are techno logically out-gunned. Whereas if we choose to evolve through the challenges to our psyche that developed communicat ion technologies present we can reinstate our Constitution and set our people free. Revolution or Evolution-change in life as we know it is inevitable. Each of us must now take a stand to commit a portion of our individual time and diminishing resources to support the action groups and individuals who are not afraid to work at taking back our government through mass exposure of its crimes. We must seek new leaders who will be committed to doing the most with the least. These leaders share th e battle cry that SILENCE DOES (indeed) EQUAL DEATH. 6 Hund, Linda, Secret Age nda, St. Martin's Press 1991 "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" ALEX HOUSTON "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" 48 "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"PART II by Cathy O'Brien "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" AN OPEN LETTER Mind control is absolute.

I have prepared this book for y our review and edification concerning a little known tool that \"our\" United Stat es Government is covertly, illegally, and un-constitutionally using to implement the New World Order (One World Government). This well documented tool is a sophisticated and advanced form of behavior modification (brainwashi ng) most commonly known as MIND CONTROL. My first hand knowledge of this TOF SECRET U.S. Government Psychological Warfare technique is draw n from my personal experience as a White House \"Presidential Model\" mind-control slave. Much of the information enclosed herein has been corroborated and validated through brave and courageous \"clean\" members of the law enforcement, scientific, and Intelligence communities familiar with this case These individuals' efforts helped me to understand and corroborate what happened after a lifetime of systemat ic physical and psychological torture orchestrated to modify my behavior th rough totally controlling my mind. Some of these courageous individuals are employed by the very system that controlled me and live in fear of losing their jobs, their families, or their lives. They have gone as far as they dare towards publicly exposing this tool of the engineers of the New World Order-to no avail. This book is a grassroots effort to solicit and enlist the public and private s upport of Human Rights advocates, the recognized, respected doers in America to expose this invisible personal and social menace. This can be done by well organised, cooperative citizens with a passion for justice, who have expressed interest in restoring our Constitution and taking back America. This copy you hold is for your edification and action. While these pages have been condensed for your quick perusal, there ane literally thousands of files of document ation that support much of what I am reporting. Thanks to those dedicate d individuals who found a means of manipulating the system more cleverly than the perpetrators, the documents referred to were declassified for release right at the source! It is my patriotic respect for the princi ples of truth, justice, and ultimately that freedom on which America was found ed that compels me to expose the world domination motivations of those in control of our government, commonly referred to as the Shadow Government. By taking back America NOW, we can maintain the integrity of our country's history and future by detaining its destined course of being recognized world wide for the mind-control atrocities unleashed on humanity that literally begin where Adolph Hitler left off. Hitler's version of world domination that he termed in 1939 the \"New World Order\" is currently being implemented through advanced technologies in, among others, genetic mind-control engineering by those in control of America. Senator Daniel Inouye, (D. HI) comme nted about the operations of this secret government before a Senate S ubcommittee and described it well as \"...a shadowy government with its own Air Force, its own Navy, its own fund raising mechanism, and the ability to pursu e its own ideas of 'national interest', free from all checks and balances and free from the law itself.\" The expertise of my primary advocat e and skilled deprogrammer, Mark Phillips, developed through his U.S. De fense Department knowledge of \"Top Secret\" mind-control research and researchers, was responsible for the restoration of my mind to normal functio ning. As a result, I have recovered the "},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"memories related in this text, and having survived the ordeal, have reached this point of enormous frustration. In 1988, through a series of brilliantly orchestrated events, Mark Phillips rescued me and my 8-year-old daughter, Kelly, from our mind-controlled existence and took us to the safety of Alaska for rehabilitation. It was there that we began the tedious process of untangling my amnesic mind to consciously recal l what I was supposed to forget, Many U,S. and foreign government se crets and personal reputations were staked on the belief that I could not be deprogrammed and rehabilitated to accurately reveal the criminal covert activities and perversions in which Kelly and I were forced to participate, particularly during the Reagan/Bush Administrations. Now that I have gained control of my own mind, I view it as my duty as a mother and American patrio t to exercise my gained free will to expose the mind-control atrocities that my daughter and I endured at the hands of those in control of our government. This personal view of inside Pandora's Box includes a keen perception of how mind control is being used to apparently implement the New World Order, and a personal knowledge of WHO some of the so-called \"masterminds\" are behind this world and mind dominance effort. Most Americans old enough to remember recall exactly where they were and what they were doing when President John F. Kennedy was shot. His assassination traumatized the nation and provides an exampl e of how the human mind photographically records events surrounding trauma. The traumas I routinely endured during my mind-contr olled victimization provided me the latitude to recover my memory in th e photographic detail in which it was recorded. The direct quotes 1 have incl uded in the following pages depicting carefully selected events, are verbatim. I apologize for any obscenities quoted, but this was necessary to maintain the in tegrity of the statements and accurately reflect the character of the speaker(s). While I am free to speak my mind, Ke lly, now 17, is not so fortunate. Kelly has yet to receive rehabilitation for her shattered personality and programmed young mind. The high tech sophistication of the Project Monarch trauma-based mind-control procedures she endured, literally since birth, reportedly requires highly specialized, qualified care to aid her in eventually gaining control of her mind and life. Due to the political power of our abusers, all efforts to obtain her inalienable right to rehabilitation and seek justice have been blocked under the guise of so-called \"National Security\". As a result, Kelly remains untreated in the custody of the State of Tennessee-a victim of the system—a system controlled and ma nipulated by our abusive government \"leaders\" - a system where State Forms make no allowances to report military TOP SECRET abuses - a system which exis ts due to federal funding directed by our perverse, corrupt abusers in Wash ington, D.C. She remains a political prisoner in the custody of the State of Tennessee to this moment, waiting and hurting! Violations of laws and rights, Psychol ogical Warfare intimidation tactics, threats to our lives, and various other forms of CIA Damage Containment practices thus far have remained unhind ered and unchecked due to the National Security Act of 1947 AND the 1986 Reagan Amendment to same which allows those in control of our government to censor and/or cover-up anything they choose. Now, with our country free from outside threats as a result of the fall of the Soviet Union, our \"free press\" is reportedly no longer encumbered by censorship. This fact alone should free us to pursue justice, but it has not. Please ask why. "},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Hence the purpose of releasing this b ook at this time. After seven long years of being unjustly and painfully seperate d from my daughter, while our abusers have had full access to her through a corrupt and manipulated system, it is my fervent hope and intent to solicit help from you in the form of advice, expertise, and public outcry concerning this very solvable problem. I could not prevent the traumatic mind-c ontrol abuses Kelly endured due to my own victimization, yet she is depe nding on me now to expose the truth and enlist the help that the Juvenile Court has restrained her from seeking. I dedicate this book to Kelly, and all others like he r, and to every American unaware of the mind-control atrocities prevailing in this country. What Americans don't know is destroying them from the inside out. Knowledge is our only defense against mind control. It is time to WAKE UP and arm ourselves with the truth, restore the constitutional values of freedom and justice for all, to retroactively enforce the 13th Amendment, and take back America! "},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 MY INTRODUCTION TO HUMANITY My pedophile father, Earl O'Brien, brags that he began substituting his penis for my mother's nipple soon afte r I was born. My multgenerational incest-abused mother, Carol Tanis, did not protest his perverse actions due to (reportedly) having similar abuse as a child which caused her to acquire Multiple Personality Disorder. 1 My earliest recovered memory was that I could not breathe with my father's penis jammed into my lit tle throat. Yet I could not discern his semen from my mother's milk. I do not recall thinking, but I am aware through education that this earl y sexual abuse distorted my primitive concepts of feeding, breathing, sexuality, and parental perceptions. I recall as a toddler being unable to run (I could barely walk) to my mother for help as my instincts demanded. Through my gulping sobs, my terror rose as I tried to clear my throat of my father's semen and draw a breath of air. My mother finally arrived at my side. Rather than comfort me, she accused me of throwing a temper tantrum and \"holding my breath\". She responded only by throwing a glass of cold water in my face. 1 was shocked! As the water splashed my face, I knew she would not help and it was up to me to save myself. I automatically Multiple Personal ity Disordered. I was, of course, too young to logically understand that what my father was doing to me was wrong. I accepted his strangling sexual abuse as a normal and natural part of my home life, and split off a personality to deal with the pain and suffocation to satisfy his perversions. Therefore as a child, I was dissociative of my father's abuse. I was totally unable to recall his sexual abuse, even in his presence, until 1 saw and felt his penis. Then the terror, which was my conditioned response, triggered access to that part of my brain that previously endured the trauma, I was remembering the abuse and how to de al with it. This part of my brain developed into a personality of its own- which belonged to my father-which he rented out and later sold to the U.S. Government as will be explained and detailed in the following pages. Other parts of my conditioned mind dea lt with other abusers, abuses and circumstances. My father was (as revealed by my own investigations) apparently a multigenerational incest child from a large, poor, and horribly dysfunctional family. His mother earned a living as a prostitute for local lumbermen after his father died when he was two years old. My father's brothers and sister were all sexually and (o ccult) ritually abused just as he was. They grew up to be drug addicts, pros titutes, street derelicts, and pedophiles who also sexually abused me and my br others and sisters. I developed more personality splits to deal with the traumas of these torturous relationships. My mother's dysfunctional family also appears to be multigenerational, but of a slightly higher socio-economic class. Her father owned the building occupied by a Masonic Blue Lodge he led, and managed a local beer distribution business with her mother after completing his military career. Together they sexually abused my moth er and her three brothers, who in turn sexually abused me. My family often went camping on the vast wilderness acreage surrounding my grandfather's Masonic Lodge in Newa ygo, Michigan. Large bluffs referred to as \"The High Banks' overlooked the White River flowing through his "},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"property, which is where we pitched our tents. My mother's brothers, Uncle Ted and Uncle Arthur \"Bomber\" Tanis, often accompanied us and sexually abused my brother and me. It was deer hunting season in or around November, 1961, when my father took the family camping on The High Banks to hunt with my uncles. That night, as my brother and I were being se xually passed around the campfire to satisfy pedophile perversions, a lost hun ter stumbled into our camp. My father shot him when he attempted to run; th e rifle's blasts piercing my brain and further fragmenting my mind. I sat dazed in a dissociative trance while my mother methodically picked up the camps ite and my father and uncles disposed of the body. As my father drove us away from th e crime scene, we were stopped by several hunters who had the road blocked in a desperate attempt to locate their missing companion. They de scribed the man I saw my fa ther kill, and said they heard gunshots. Reality intruded on my dissociative trance, and I screamed and cried hysterically until I no longer knew why I was crying. My Uncle Ted 2 soon became a street derelict. Uncle Bomber died a few years later from alcoholism in his earl y forties. And my father became more financially and politically connected. My mother's oldest brother, Uncle Bob, was a pilot in Air Force In- telligence and often boasted that he worked for the Vatican. Uncle Bob was also a commercial pornographer, produci ng kiddie porn for the local Michigan Mafia, which looped back to Mafia porn king and U.S. Representative Jerry Ford. I split off more personalities ju st to deal with my Uncle Bob, his \"friends,\" and the perverse business he shared with my father. My father's sixth grade education had earned him a job as a worm digger for local sport fishermen. By the t ime I was six years old, however, his pornographic exploitation of my older brother, Bill, and me had provided enough income to move us into a bigger house nestled in the Michigan sand dunes. My father was right at home ther e. The tourists and drug dealers who littered the eastern shore of Lake Mich igan further supplemented his income by paying for perverse sex with us childre n. My father also became involved in illicit drug sales. Soon after we moved, my father was reportedly caught sending kiddie porn through the U.S. mail. It was a bestia lity film of me with my Uncle Sam O'Brien's Boxer dog, Buster. My Uncle Bo b, also implicated in manufacturing the porn, out of apparent desperation info rmed my father of a U.S. Government Defense Intelligence Agency TOP SECR ET Project to which he was privy. This was Project Monarch. Project Monarch was a mind-control operation which was \"recruiting\" multigenerational incest abused children with Multiple Personality Disorder for its geneti c mind-control studies. I was a prime \"candidate,\" a \"chosen one\". My fath er seized the opportunity as it would provide him immunity from prosecution. In the midst of the pandemonium that ensued, Jerry Ford arrived at our house with the evidence in hand for a meeting with my father. \"Is Earl home?\" he called to my mother, who nervously stood behind the screen door, hesitating to let him in. \"Not yet,\" my mother replied, her voice shaking. \"He should have been home from work by now-I know he's expecting you.\" \"That's OK\". Ford turned his attenti on to me. I was standing outside on the front porch, and he crouch ed down to my level. Patting the large, brown "},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"envelope containing the confiscated porn tucked under his arm he said, \"You like doggies, huh?\" \"Buster is a nice doggy,\" I replied. \"He's funny.\" Not understanding why the dog had been whisked away when the porn was confiscated, I complained, \"Bus ter's gone.\" \"Buster's gone?\" Ford asked. \"Yeah. My Uncle Sam took him away,\" I told him. Ford laughed loudly at the irony of my statement. In my limited view, I thought he f ound it humorous that Buster was gone. My father pulled into the driveway, honking the horn of his new, tan convertible. Ford stood up. With his fly eye level to me, I noticed his penis was erect and reached for it as conditioned. \"Not now, honey,\" he said. \"I have bus iness to tend...\" Ford went inside with my parents to officially seal my fate. Not long after that my father was flow n to Boston for a two-week course at Harvard on how to raise me for this of f-shoot of MK-Ultra Project Monarch, When he returned from Boston, my fath er was smiling and pleased with his new knowledge of what he termed \"reverse psychology\". This equates to \"satanic reversals,\" a nd involves such play-on-words as puns and phrases that stuck in my mind like, \"You earn your keep, and I'll keep what you earn.\" He presented me with a co mmemorative charm bracelet of dogs, and my mother with the news that they \"would be having more children\" to raise in the project. (I now have two sisters and four brothers ranging from age 16 to 37 who are still under mind control.) My mother complied with my father's suggestions, mastering the art of language manipulation. For example, when I could not snap my own pajama top to the bottoms in a childish effort to keep my father out of them, I asked my mother, ''please snap me\". She did. she would snap her forefingers against my skin in a stinging manner. The pain I felt was psychological as this proved to me once again that she had no intention of protecting me from my father's sexual abuse. Also in keeping with his government-pr ovided instructions, my father began working me like the legendary Cinderella . I shoveled fireplace ashes, hauled stacked firewood, raked leaves, shoveled snow, chopped ice, and swept— \"because,\" my father said, \"your little ha nds fit so nicely around the rake, mop, shovel, and broom handles.\" By this time, my father's sexual explo itation of me included prostitution to his friends, local mobsters and Masons, relatives, Satanists, strangers, and police officers. When I wasn't being worked to physical exhaustion, filmed pornographically, prostituted, or engaged in incest abuse, 1 dissociated into books. I had lear ned to read at the young age of four due to my photographic memory which was a natural result of MPD/DID. Government researchers involved in MK -Ultra Project Monarch knew about the photographic memory aspect of MPD/ DID, of course, as well as other resultant \"super human\" characteristics. Visual acuity of an MPD/DID is 44 times greater than that of the average person. My developed unusually high pain threshold, plus compartmentaliza tion of memory were \"necessary\" for military and covert operations applic ations. Additionally, my sexuality was primitively twisted from infancy. This programming was appealing and useful to perverse politicians who believed they could hide their actions deep within my memory compartments, which clin icians refer to as personalities. "},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Immediately after my father's return from Boston, I was routinely prostituted to then Michigan State Senator Guy VanderJagt. VanderJagt later became a U.S. Congressman and eventu ally chairman of the Republican National Congressional Committee that put George Bush in the office of President. I was prostituted to VanderJ agt after numerous local parades which he always participated in, at the Mackinac Island Political Retreat, and in my home state of Michigan, among other places. My Uncle Bob helped my father deco rate my bedroom in red, white, and blue paneling and American flags. He provided assistance in scrambling my mind according to Project Monarch methodologies. Fairy tale themes were used to confuse fantasy with reality, particularly Disney stories and the Wizard of Oz, which provided th e base for future programming. I had personalities for pornography, a personality for bestiality, a personality for incest, a personality for withstanding the horrendous psychological abuse of my mother, a pers onality for prostitution, and the rest of \"me\" functioned somewhat \"normaily\" at school. My \"normal\" personality provided a cover for the abuse I was e nduring, but best of all it had hope- hope that there was somewhere in the world where people did not hurt each other This same personality also attended Catechism, a weekly class at our Catholic church, St. Francis de Sales in Muskegon, Michigan. My Catechism teacher was a Nun, or \"Sister.\" Although I could not consciously think to protect myself from abuse, I had decided that becoming a Nun would provide me with the kind of life I sought. I could not rely upon my family, the police, or politicians to protect me. The church appeared to be my answer, and I listened diligently in class and prayed religiously. I learned all about the political structure of the church, and was prepared for my first Confession, The Catholic beliefs I was taught incl ude the idea that man is not fit to talk to God (the Father) di rectly, but must have a prie st intercede instead. This is the purpose of going to Confession. I wa s instructed to tell my sins to the priest (also referred to as Father), who would relay the message to God. He would then supposedly t e l l me how many \"Hail Marys\" and \"Our Father\" prayers to say as my penance, or punishment. My Catechism teacher gave the class several examples of \"sins,\" which included \"sex outside of marriage.\" When the Priest, Father James Thaylen, slid open the little screened partition in the closet sized confessional, I began as 1 had been instructed, \"Forgive me Father, for I have sinned....\" I then pro ceeded to tell h i m that I had sex with my father and brother, to which he responded that I should \"say three Hail Marys and one Our Father an d 1 would be forgiven?!\" I knew then that I had to either believe that this Confession thing was a hoax, or that God condoned sexual child abuse. That night, my father had a talk with me. Apparently he was the \"Father\" that the priest had interceded to. My father instructed me that \"from now on,\" I was to simply say \"I disobeyed my parents\" when I went to Confession and nothing more! The next time I went to Confession, I did exactly as I was told. The veiled screen came off the Confessional part ition between me and the priest, and a penis was stuck through the window, \"God sa id that your penance is to treat me as you would your father. And remember, 'whatsoever you do to the least of your brothers, that you do unto me'.\" After performing oral sex on Father Thaylen, I emerged from the Confessional where all the other kids were waiting very impatiently for their turn. My te acher scolded me for taking so long and "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"told me to add a few extra \"Our Father s\" to my penence. When I told her 1 already did my penence, she told me again the \"order of things\" to the Confessional r i t u a l — which did not fit anything I had just experienced! Without ever consciously knowing why, I abandoned the idea of becoming a Nun as that part of me, too, split off from what was left of my \"normal\" base personality. I continued to maintain an i llusion of normalcy for school, 5 excelling in my studies due to my photographic memory and in spite of my chronic \"day- dreaming\". I had plenty of friends and played enthusiastically at recess, expending large amounts of energy in my subconcious effort to escape my own mind. And I lost myself in the books my father suggested I read: the Wizard Of Oz, Alice In Wonderland, Island of th e Blue Dolphins, Disney Classics, and Cinderella—all of which were used in conditioning my mind for what soon would become mind-control programming.\" My television viewing was restricted and monitored in keeping with my father's gained knowledge. I was, howe ver permitted to watch the \"best\" of movies: The Wizard Of Oz, Disney Classics, Alice In Wonderland, and Cinderella—over and over and over again. When I was in second grade, my Brow nie Troop marched in the Memorial Day Parade in which then Michigan State Senator VanderJaut also participat- ed. At the end of the parade, he took me into a nearby motel and had me per- form oral sex on him before sending me back to where my Brownie Troop was waiting. My Brownie leader an d peers thought it commendable that VanderJagt took me with him. They gathered around to hear a l l about it. I noticed a white splash of semen on my sash, and hurriedly explained that he had \"taken me for a milkshake\" as 1 wi ped it. away. Having to cover for his perversion to my Brownie Troop infrin ged on my school personality, and the \"normal\" remainder became even smaller. With the memory of this incident compartmentalized in my mind. I made so conscious association to Vander Jagt when my t h i r d grade teacher announced that we were taking a field t r i p t o the State Capital in Lansing, Michigan where he was in session. Once at the Capital, I was ushered away from my classmates and taken to an office where he was waiting with h i s friend and mentor (soon to be President) Gerald Ford. VanderJagt l i f t e d my skirt, pulled down my panties, and placed me on his desk for sex with him and Ford. Afterward they laughe d as VanderJagd placed a small American flag in my rectum and instructed me to wave it. He then presented me with a Kennedy pen inscribed with the motto that would lead me for the rest of my mind-con- trolled existence, \"Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.\" VanderJagt then escorted me back to the balcony of the Legislature where my classmates were gathered. He put his arm around me in front of all my classmates and presented me with the Am erican Flag he had just had me wave for him and Ford with my rectum. My school personality split off again, but I still maintained the hope that somewhere, someday, 1 would find a place where people didn't...what? 1 could not remember what 1 was seeking to escape. "},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"1 Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD), now known among ment al health professionals as Dissociative Identity Disorder (DTD) is the mind's sa ne defense to an insane situation. It is a way of dealing with trauma that is literally to o horrible to comprehend. Incestuous rape violates primitive instinct and surpasses pain tolerance. By compartmen talizing the memory of such horrendous abuse, the rest of the mind can fu nction \"normally\" as th ough nothing had happened. This compartmentalization is created by the br ain actually shutting down neuron pathways to a specific part of the brain. These neuron path ways are triggered open again when the abuse recurs. The same part of the brain that is alrea dy conditioned to the trauma deals with it again and again as needed. 2 Uncle Ted had also cried hysterically the ni ght of the murder. Several years later, he almost killed himself when he drove his car into the White River near the place of the murder. 3 Gerald Ford, aka Leslie Lynch King, Jr., served on the appropriations subcommittee for the CIA and was appointed to the Warren Commission to investigate the assassination of President John F. Kennedy while I knew him only as a pom boss! 4 My mother often voiced complaints that she \"could not see faces,\" which personal experience has taught me indicated that she was suffering from on going physical and psychological traumas, a nd therefore was not in control of her senses. 5 Had my teachers been educated in the obvious signs of child abuse, my \"illusion of normalcy\" would have been interpreted as a cr y for help. Dissociative trance daydreaming, tones of helplessness and sexuality in drawings, and the electric prod marks on my face should have been recognized. 6 These same themes were rou tinely used in creating Project Monarch slaves. This fact emerged through years of networking with mental health professionals. "},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 THE RITE TO REMAIN SILENT On May 7, 1966, I was dressed in white from my Catholic veil to my white patent leather shoes as was mandatory for making my first holy communion. I was standing outside the newly built, twis ted concrete structure of Muskegon's St. Francis of Assisi Church waiting fo r the ceremony to commence when Guy VanderJagt, who was affiliated with the church, strode across the lawn towards me. Crouching down on one knee, VanderJa gt said, \"You look beautiful today. You are as beautiful as your name. Cathleen is Gaelic for \"the pure,\" and it is clear to me that you are flawless in your purity. Ann means \"grace\". It is by the grace of God, not your actions, that you are pure. Pure at heart. You are covered by the blood of our Lord and Sa vior, just like the cross on which he hung. This is for you.\" He opened a black velvet box, revealing a rosy cross necklace. Like the Kennedy inscribed pen he had presented me with at the state capical, the meaning behind the rosy cr oss necklace would lead me through the rest of my mind-con trolled existence. VanderJagds pedophile comrade in Project Monarch, Father Don, joined us, reaching deep into the pocket of his robes to present me with a delicate blue charm of the Holy Mother. It was to be worn in conjunction with the rosy cross \"to symbolize your service to the holy Ca tholic church,\" Father Don told me, which I would \"promise to serve and obey\". As VanderJagt fastened the rosy cros s and blue virgin around ray neck, he told me I was now dressed appropriat ely for the ceremony in red, white, and blue. I could feel h i s breath on my ne ck as he fastened the necklace and instructed, \"When Father says 'Body of Christ' and you say 'Ahhh men'... you acknowledge that Christ is God made man, and that you know what men are for. When Father gives you the host, it will stick to the roof of your mouth unless you suck it off his thumb.\" I hurried to line up with my Catechism classmates for the procession into the church for our holy communion mass. \"Body of Christ,\" Father Don said, holding up the host. \"Ahhh... men,\" I responded as instructed, sucking the wafer off his thumb. After services, VanderJagt and Father D on talked with me briefly while my parents congregated with other parishi oners. Father was telling me, \"...God has chosen you for work within his holy church. You are a Chosen One, 1 my child...\" Later that evening, VanderJagt attended the reception that my parents were holding for me at our house. He talked with my father awhile, but spent most of his time talking with my Uncle B ob, who had recently flown in from \"a mission over seas\". My Uncle Bob and Va nderJagt were friends, and remained so throughout the years. As the party dispersed, VanderJagt drove me back to churc h for a \"special evening service with Father Don.\" VanderJagt unlocked the rectory door of the old church across the street from the new St. Francis structure, expl aining that we had to \"have a very important talk now that I had eaten the body of Christ.\" The talk, blood trauma, and sexual abuse that ensued conditioned my mind to readily accept "},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"prgramming throughout the years that deliberately merged both U.S. Government and Jesuit mind-control e fforts for New World Order controls. \"I work for the Vatican, and now, so do you,\" VanderJagt told me. \"You have just entered into a covenant wi th the holy Catholic church. You must never break that covenant.\" Still capable of questioning at that time, I asked, \"What is a covenant?\" VanderJagt answered, \"A covenant is a promise to keep secrets, the secret that the church knew all along. The Pope has all the secrets locked away at the Vatican. Your Uncle Bob and I have been to the Vatican. It is time you entered into the holy covenant and learne d the secrets of the church that were written long before Christ even came into being. The Dominican monks kept the covenant that Noah carried into the new world. They kept the secret with them. It was written on parchment and kept in a secret place in the Vatican. They took a Vow of Silence to never rev eal its location, or its content. You must enter into the covenant. You must car ry the secret to your grave. Keep it secret from your mom, dad, everybody.\" VanderJagt proceeded to fill my s uggestible young mind with biblical interpretation that laid the groundwork for future \"inter/inner dimensional\" programming themes utilized by Projec t Monarch programmers to control the compartmentalization of memory synonymous with MPD/DID. \"Christ saw them all,\" VanderJagt was telling me, \"They are dimensions, places you can see on your way to death.- That's why they're called die- mentions. You must remember that Christ died and came back to tell us everything he saw while he was on his way to heaven. He was gone three days, but it was much longer than that where he was because time isn't the same in other dimensions. Purgatory is one other dimension. Hell is one. And there are lots of others in between. Oz is an other dimension. The sky is not the limit to all the worlds out there wailing to be explored. You can travel in and out of ail these dimensions, learning the secr ets of the universe. You have been chosen to explore these oilier worlds fo r the church. Listen in the stillness and you will hear his voice guiding you 3 on your missions. The rosy cross is like Dorothy's ruby slippers. Never take your ro sy cross off, Cathy, when traveling other dimensions and you will alwa ys be able to return home.\" Father Don joined VanderJagt in a ritual which bathed me in the blood of a slaughtered lamb, and subsequently, thr ough this hideous blood trauma, locked their stated perceptions and a basis for mind-control programming deep in my mind. This basis for programming was an chored in the Vow of Silence which the Jesuit monks take \"not only to keep secrets, but so they can st il l their mind and hear their inner guidance.\" Certain th at the \"Rite to Remain Silent\" which they had performed would ensure that I keep their secret Father Don and Guy VanderJagt subjected me to their pedoph ile perversions. The two joked that I had become \"a good Cathy-lick\". After the Rite to Remain Silent was installed, the voices of my multiple personalities that I had previously heard in my head ceased. In the silence of deliberately created memory compartments, I could only hear the voices of my abusers who created them... commanding my silence. Silence for who and what I knew wa s involved in Project Monarch Mind Control. My family routinely vacationed at Ma ckinac Island, Michigan which is a small island positioned in the Great Lakes close to the Canadian border Mackinac Island, with the Governor's Mansion and hist orical Grand Hotel, was "},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"a political playground where I was prosti tuted by my father to, among others,. pedophiles Jerry Ford, Guy VanderJagt, and later U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd. The mind-controlled part of me that was prostituted there perceived Mackinac as another dimension, the timelessness of wh ich was enhanced by the island's anti- quated styling. Automobiles were forb idden on the tiny island, which relied on horse drawn buggies or bicycles for transportation. Once when Lee Iaccoca was attending a cocktail party at then Gove rnor Romney's Mansion, I overheard him comment, \"What better place for auto ex ecs to get away from it all than on an island with no cars?\" Mackinac Island, due to its geographic location, provided an air of friendliness between the U.S. and Canada that formed my childish perception that our countries knew no boundaries. This political view was further enhanced by my father always taking the family to Niagra Falls where my mind was to be symbolically \"washed of all memory\" or what had occurred in Mackinac. Niagara Falls' numerous, powerful waterfalls were in reasonably close proximity to Mackinac Island, and shared the border between the U.S. and Canada. When Pierre Trudeau was elected Prime Minister of Canada in 1968, I often heard it said, \"Pierre Trudeau is one of Ours, you know.\" I first heard this phrase cryptically referring to Trudeau's loyalty to the Vatican when Father Don was discussing h i m with my famer one Sunday after mass. This fact circulated quickly among those I knew who were involved in the Catholic/Jesuit aspect of Project Monarch. The summer after Trudeau was elected, my father took the family to Mackinac Island as usual. Climbing on a large statue on the grounds of the Governor's Mansion, I could see across th e field to the Grand Hotel. I noticed Canadian flags flying amongst the American flags that lined the front of the old hotel. As I slid down off the statue, Guy VanderJagt approached with a drink and a cigarette in his hand. Palling my hair into place he said, \"Straighten your shirt, I've got someone important for you to meet,\" \"I knew someone important was here because of those flags,\" I said, tucking my shirt in my pink shorts. \"When I was at the Vatican,\" VanderJagt began, \"I was told that Prime Minister Trudeau is a friend of the Pope. He thinks like one of us. A true Catholic. He likes Cathy-licks.\" VanderJagt led me upstairs in the mansion, where Pierre Trudeau was lowering the window shades in a dimly lit bedroom crowded with antiques. VanderJagt closed the door behind me. Trudeau's tuxedo coat was neatly draped over a chair, which left him in his formal pants, while shirt, and a bright red cummerbund which caught my eye. \"I like your sash,\" I said. \"Hasn't anyone taught you Silence yet?\" His somber, gruff attitude was softened by his smooth, silky voice. Triggered into the part of me that endured the Rite to Remain Silent, 1 assumed Trudeau knew all about interdim ensions according to my deliberately formed perceptions. I could not/did not understand that interdimensions actually equated to the inner-dimensions of my own compartmentalized mind. Likewise, I did not understand that \"Keys to the Kingdom\" referred to knowing the codes, keys, and triggers to my c ontrolled mind. \"Guy said you like Cathy- licks,\" I said, repeating what VanderJagt had told me. \"Are you the Keeper of the Keys?\" "},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Trudeau seemingly bore his cold, da rk eyes right through me. \"You can learn more from the school of thought than you can by asking precocious questions. Haven't you learned that child ren are to be seen and not heard?\" \"Is that a precocious question?\" I asked. \"What is a precocious question?\" Trudeau sighed with impatience. \"That is irrelevant. What matters is that you shut your mouth, still your mind, and enter the school of thought. Silence is a virtue. Listen to the silence in the stillness of your mind. Go deep inside your mind,\" he slowly led. \"Deeper and deeper where it's quiet and still...\" Trudeau expertly manipulated my mind with sophisticated hypnotic language. Not only did he enlist my Si lence for the pedophile perversions he indulged in, but he instructed my \"school of thought\" in a manner that equated to programming. He laid a foundation fo r Air-Water programs that is a mirror- dimensional theme often used by NASA and others involved in Project Monarch. Playing off his own name \"Pee-Air,\" he added a perverse twist to the theme that he accessed each time 1 was prostituted to him. Had I been capable of fear, I would have been afraid of Pierre Trudeau. Trudeau's slow, deliberate movements masked the brutal power of his body much the way his smooth, soft voice pi erced my mind and intruded on my thoughts. The icey cold touch of hi s effeminate, manicured long fingers contrasted with the heat of his perver sion... a perversion for which he blamed me and my \"temptuous, contemptuous ways\". In my childish ignorance, I believed Trudeau's demeanor and forward combed hair were characteristic of his French descent. \"I know all about the French,\" I had bragged to my new \"Gra ndpa\" Van while visiting his home in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, My mother's father had died shortly before Kennedy was assassinated, and my Grandmother quickly latched onto a wealthy, highly political businessman from Milwaukee. She met Grandpa Va n Vandenburg on the passenger/cargo ship that traveled the waters of the Great Lakes, the Milwaukee Clipper. The Clipper transported cargo including Cadillacs from Vandenburg Motors to Canada, as well as the drugs sanctioned by the local Coast Guard via the U.S. Government that my father distributed. Sometimes 1 accompanied my father to the docks in Muskegon to pick up the drag shipment, which usually involved prostitution. Jerry Ford and Guy Vander Jagt combined business with pleasure in the ship's casinos on occasion, wh ich is where the connection between my Grandma and Grandpa Van was reporte dly made. Grandpa Van knew Jerry Ford, and subsequently was acquainted with Pierre Trudeau. \"What do you know about the French?\" Grandpa Van asked me as I sat on his living room floor petting the dog he just brought home. Improperly cued and dumfounded by his question I remained silent. \"I know you've met Pierre Trudeau,\" he prompted. \"I also know you love doggies. So I bought this dog for your grandma now, so you could enjoy him, too. His name is Pepe. He's a French Poodle,\" \"I know all about the French.\" I said , mentally comparing the large French Poodle in front of me to Trudeau. \"They have pretty nails...\" I stroked Pepe's painted toenails. \"They have funny hair...\" I petted Pepe's clipped fur. \"And they pee a lot,\" I giggled. \"You'd better take him outside, then,\" Grandpa Van told me, attaching Pepe's leash. After walking the dog past what felt like every tree in the neighborhood, I announced that 1 would call him \"Pee-pee\". "},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Uncle Bob filmed Pepe and I pornogr aphically on numerous occasions, producing bestiality films that I would la ter learn Pierre Trudeau was privy to. Pepe remained a part of my experi ence long after Grandpa Van divorced himself from my Grandma, and long after I developed beyond Trudeau's perversion for little children. 1 was slow to grow into adolescence. By the time I was thirteen years old, my breasts were tender and beginning to swell, which made me \"too old\" for VanderJagt's pedophile perversions. When my father brought me to Mackinac Island for routine prostitution at the Politic al Retreat, VanderJagt introduced me to a new friend he had made now that he was in Washington, D.C. as a U.S. Congressman-U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat from West Virginia. Byrd had been a U.S. Senator as long as I had been alive, serving as Senate Whip and later as President Pro Tempore of the Senate and as the all powerful Senate Appropriations leader. Byrd co mmanded attention and respect from all who came in contact with him, particularly from my father. When we were left alone in his room, he loomed over me in a threatening stance. His cold, blue slitty eyes locked onto mine. I undressed and climbed into his bed as ordered. I was momentarily relieved to find that his penis was abnormally tiny—so small it didn't even hurt! And I could breathe w ith it in my mouth! Then he began to indulge himself in his brutal perversions, talking on and on about how I was \"made just for him\" due to the vast amounts of pain I could withstand. The spankings and police handcuffs I had pr eviously endured were child's play compared to Senator Byrd's near death tortures. The hundreds of scars on my body still show today. With VanderJagt, sex was a matter of \"how much I could give,\" whereas with Byrd it was \"how much I could take\". And I was forced to take mote pain than any human could logically withstand. I was dedicated to Byrd at age thirteen which meant he would be directing my future in Project Monarch, and my father would raise me according to his specifications. My MPD/DID existence became more regimented from that point on. I was kept physically worn down to the point of exhaustion in order that I be sufficiently receptive to my father's limited hypnotic programming capabilities to condition my mind for mind control. The pornography I was forced to anticipate in became much more violent immediately after Byrd, switching me from predominantly pedophile and bestiality themes to torturous versions of sadomasochism (S&M). My father and mother worked in tandem daily to \"break my spirit,\" destroying any remnan ts left of my self-confidence, tearing down my self-esteem, and thus annihilating my free will urges. They conditioned/taught me my dreams were reality and my reality were dreams, that black is white and up is down. \"Good night, sleep tight, dream about your mommy and daddy\" is what I heard every night. This was intended to confuse my mind to believe incest in the middle of the night was \"just a bad dream\". My television, books, and music became even more strictly controlled and monitored that before. This was not onl y to infringe on my last minuscule freedom of choice, but for total mi nd-control conditioning purposes. For example, the annual televising of Judy Garland's Wizard Of Oz was celebrated as a grand holiday around my house. This was to prepare my mind for future base programming on the them e that I, like Dorothy, could \"spin\" into another dimension \"Over the Rainbow\" . After all, \"Birds (Byrds) fly over the Rainbow...\" was a theme that became a part of my life."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"My father insisted I watch the Walt Disney movie Cinderella with him, paralleling my existence to Cinderella 's—\"magically trance-forming from a dirty little slave to a beautiful Princess\". In typical \"reverse psychology\" humor, he referred to pornographic photos when singing \"Someday my Prince (prints) will come,\" or by placing literal sexual emphasis on \"will come\". My brother, Bill, who was often featur ed in kiddie porn with me, was not a \"chosen one\" for Project Monarch (bey ond supplying more children to be dedicated in later years). Yet my father figured that \"what was good for me would be good for my brother\". He took us to see Walt Disney's Pinocchio, explaining that my brother and I were his puppets still in the carving stage. The distortions of reality that these and other Disney theme movies provided when coupled with my father's government trained conscious and subconscious controlling influence, began to further erode our ability to discern fantasy from reality. My brother, now 37, remain s psychologically locked into those traumatic childhood years and is obsesse d with Disney themes and productions to this day. His house is decorated in Disney memorabilia, he wears Disney clothes, listens to my father's inst ructions on h i s Disney telephone, and maintains \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" as his favorite song, which has locked his children into the same theme. My father also instructed me to wa tch Alfred Hitchcock's horrifying movie The Birds with him. This reinforced in my mind the movie's theme that there is \"no place to hide from the birds/Byrd\". I was quickly beginning to lose all ability to question anything but my own judgment. It was easy to believe that there was indeed \"no place to run, no place to hide,\" which is a necessary and primary psychological basis for government/military mind control. In later years, \"who ya' gonna call?\" and Ronald Reagan's quip \"you can run, but you can't hide\" echoed deep within my mind. After all, even if I could think to seek help, who would help me? The police? The church? My parents? Relative? Politicians? School? There was no one left that would help me, I sensed. My television programming was then expanded to include the shows that every Project Monarch Mind-Control sl ave I knew had to watch: I Dream Of Jeannie, The Brady Bunch, Gumby And Poke y, and Bewitched. I could relate to the Genie pleasing her master, who was a Major for the Air Force in I Dream Of Jeannie. This served to confuse the reality of my own experiences with the fantasy of television production. I told all outsiders that my family was \"just like the Bradys\". Through Gumby And Pokey I was led to believe that I was as flexible as these animated clay performer s. Therefore, I was capable of being physically maneuvered into any sexual position. The mirrors depicted a doorways to other dimensions and adventures interlocked with my Catholic conditioning and Alice In Wonderland and Wizard Of Oz theme programming. In Bewitched, it is the normal new door neighbor that is considered crazy rather than the witches. This is another reversal that was applied to my bizarre existence. I was one of the only kids in my school that listened to country music. But then, Senator Byrd fancied himself a country music fiddler and it was \"my duty to love what he did\", I was ordered to listen to country music or no music at all. Music was my psychologi cal avenue for escape, a dissociative tool. But this, too, was used in setti ng the stage for my future as a Project Monarch \"Presidential Model\" mind-controlled slave. As suggested, I read the Boxcar Children Series over and over again, I empathized with the trials, traumas, and tribulations the children endured while "},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"they fended for themselves from their boxcar home along the railroad tracks. My father often made train sounds at me in passing to subconsciously remind me that I was currently \"in Train-ing\" on the undeterable track of the \"Freedom Train.\" 4 This term, taken from Harriet Tubman's underground railroad for slaves, reversed the meaning of the word \"freedom\" to confuse one's \"one track mind\" and instill the belief \"I am free to be a slave\". This also reinforced my training to stay on track-the plan (t rack) laid our for me. My father would often quip, \"When God passed out brains, you thought he said 'trains' and got in the wrong line\". Convicted (capital crime) career criminal, country music entertainer, and CIA operative Merle Haggard often used well documented cryptic language in his songs pertaining to government mind-control slave operations. He released songs including \"Freedom Train\" and \"Over the- Rainbow\". My father told me repeatedly that Merle Haggard was my \"favorite\" singer, and his songs reinforced my programming. Of course, Senator Byrd remained my \"favorite\" fiddler as ordered. He played train songs like \"Orange Blossom Special\" while making train sounds on his fiddle. Sometimes I was his captive audience, bound and gagged, while he played his fiddle. Other times he instru cted me to spin round and round like a music box dancer in order to add \"new dimensions to our sex\".. These new dimensions included more and more ph ysical pain through \"kinky\" torture. My father took advantage of his new political connections and advanced himself occupationalIy, manu facturing camshaft auto parts at a local factory. Soon he was promoted to a sales mana gement position due to his connections within the Pentagon Procurement Office and General Services Administration, coupled with what he had learned about double bind hypnotic persuasion. He continued to supplement his income by sexually exploiting us children. This 1 now included brazenly prostituting me to Muskegon Coast Guard officials while on cocaine runs to and from the base. Meanwhile, my father took us all to church every Sunday, and my mother stayed busy having babies to raise in the Project. In true pedophile fashion, he surrounded himself with children by coaching little league sports, chaperon ing school and Catechism activities, and becoming involved with the Boy Scouts. All of this made him appear to be a model citizen and \"pillar of the community\". The illusion was fonned. The : parts of me that knew otherwise had no choice but to remain Silent. 1 Project Monarch slaves were referred to as \"Chosen Ones\". 2 Torture to the point just before death, such as with Death's Door programming, was jointly used by the Catholic Jesuits and the CIA in Project Monarch. 3 It was the voices of my mind-control progra mmers and handlers that I later heard guiding me. 4\" Freedom Train\" is the internationally recogn ized cryptic code term for Project Monarch slave operations that I heard repeat edly throughout my victimization. "},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 MY FIRST PRESIDENT Muskegon, Michigan is a coastal tourist attraction, and home of the annual Seaway and Coast Guard festivals which bring people to the town from all over Michigan. VanderJagt remained publicly visible through opportunities such as these. My father often could be seen with Vanderjagt and was photographed at his side white judging festival events like the kiddie parades, sand sculpturing contests, and so on—all of which I entered and won. In later years, my father polished and shined the red paint of hi s 1966 Ford convertible to chauffeur VanderJagt through the local parades. This only served to reinforce the illusion that my father was a \"pillar of the community\". In 1973, Senator Byrd instructed my father to send me to Muskegon Catholic Central High School which was over seen by the director of St. Francis of Assisi Church, Father Lepre. The Ca tholic church, of course, has its own political structure, with the Pope presiding over all. The strong political ties between the Catholic church and the U. S. Government was overtly evidenced by the much publicized relationship betw een the President and the Pope during the Reagan Administration. Of course, I had been privy to this political relationship ever since my First Commu nion-a relationship that the Rite to Remain Silent was intended to cover. My experience with Catholic Central's direct involvement in Project Mona rch's physical and psychological conditioning further confirmed the union be tween the U.S. Government and the Catholic church. When Senator Byrd changed my school fr om public to Parochial, he also destroyed through dissociation my sc hool personality. I no longer viewed school as my haven from abuse, as it was controlled by the church and, as I later learned, monitored by a corrupt segment of the C.I.A. By the time I enrolled in Catholic Central, the cliques and groups had already been formed. 1 had a personality to fit in with the \"good\" kids and one that interfaced with the \"bad\". It did not take long for the \"good\" kids to notice 1 also got along with the \"bad\". I soon found the only kids that could relate to me were the other known Project victims. We clung together in a close knit group, herded around like the proverbial sheep by those in the school who knew we were MPD/DIDed and under mind control. We each switched personalities as circumstance demanded, most often in unison. We were ritually traumatized, constantly tranced, and then programmed during school hours. Since 1 no longer had my singular \"school pers onality\" and was constantly switching instead, the compartment of my brain th at held school memory was no longer consciously retrievable. Therefore, I had no basis for continued learning aside from what I could photographically memorize from class. My grades appeared erratic, ranging from A's to failing. And some A's received I did not earn academically. In my required religion class, Sister Ann Marie bad been leading us in study on the topic of Confession, This was to prepare us for the kind of Confessions we were to be giving Father Vesbit, who was also our school principal. The day Sister ordered us to Confession, I refused to go. I unconsciously feared 1 would be sexually assaulted again in th e Confessional, this time while my teenage peers waited impatiently outside the door. Sister made an example out of me to the class, saying I was a \"Sat anist\" and that I was \"going to hell\". "},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"With seemingly no escape from the occult ism that proliferated at the school, I could no longer differentiate be tween Catholicism and Satanism. Whatever Senator Byrd's purposes in sending me to Catholic school, no one seemed to notice that I had no reason to religiously adhere to Catholic principles. Therefore, the applied reve rsal of Satanism held no \"spiritual magic\" to it either. The wedge of anti-su perstition that the Catholic school was inadvertently driving into me only served to discount the occult principles and superstitious traumas that they were attempting to use to control me, Satanism is often used as an extreme pain/violence trauma base in Project Monarch Mind Control, reportedly due to the previous German Nazi Himmler Research. I did not adhere to the desi red helplessness attitude that this was \"spiritual warfare\" and out of the realm of mankind's ability to stop. Regardless of my religious beliefs or disb eliefs, I experienced the \"results\" just the same. Being subjected to and witnessi ng trauma so horrible, while my body was raped, tortured, and ravaged by me n literally drove me out of my mind. Catholic Central did increase my endurance capabilities as planned, however. I signed up for the two-mile run in the girls' track team as ordered. Muskegon Catholic Central led the state of Michigan in high school athletics, using mind-control technique to \"modify\" their star athletes and cause them to excel beyond pre-established records. Th e school gained national recognition for its contribution to professional l eagues with their manufactured programmed athletes. But, like Tommy LaSorda's Dodgers, Catholic Central's consistent victories began to raise suspicions and questions. This created a public scandal for the school that threatened to close its doors in 1975. The girls' and guys' track teams conver ged after school for practice. I was among the few females singled out fo r coaching by Coach Cheverini and his hypnotic mind-control methodisms due to my Project Monarch victimization. I was instructed to run 13 miles per day (a nother corny satanic ploy) to get in shape for my two-mile race. I often ran with a male friend who was the record holder for the two-mile in guys' track. He and I were friends, sharing much due to our similar Project Monarch victimiz ations. Together we learned how to shut out pain and fatigue when we ran. We tranced into a fast pace set in our minds by Coach Cheverini with no comprehension of time or distance. We perceived the track as our \"Yellow Br ick Road\" in accordance with the Oz theme programming. Senator Byrd's plan for building my physical endurance through Catholic Central's coaching methods proved successful for allowing me to survive his intensely torturous sexual perversions. In addition to routine trips to Mack inac Island and Niagara Falls, my family often took camping trips to \"get away from it all\". In reality, I was taken to key places for ritual abuse, prostitution, and pornography. In the fall of 1974, my father announced we were going to go camping \"back in time\" to an old fashioned festival in the small remote to wn of Cedar Springs, Michigan for their annual Red Flannel Days celebration. My mother told me to pack my jeans and sweaters and my Catholic school uniform which she had washed and pressed for the occasion. Cedar Springs was quiet, with the fest ival events including dilapidated amusement rides set up in a small parking lot, and contests where local farmers pitted their mules and horses against each other to see whose could pull the most weight. The main (and only) street of town was lined with the few local businesses, including the town's red flan nel underwear \"long Johns\" factory. In the center of town, a mock, single, jail ce ll had been erected to hold any and all "},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"parade participants who failed to wear the required red flannel underwear. The jail was guarded by quasi Keystone Cops. I was amused when the townsfolk began lining up to march in the parade, wi th very few remaining to watch it, A mentally retarded man carried the baton to lead the parade, followed by kids on bicycles, hay-wagons of old folks, a grade school band and people walking-all in their red flannel underwear. The gr and finale' of the parade, the town firetruck, was approaching, surrounded by numerous motorcycle police. I heard folks whispering \"the President is coming\". I assumed they meant the President of the underwear factory. I was wrong. I watched in horror as the firetruck rolled to a stop, and Secret Serv ice helped then President Gerald Ford as he stepped down to the pavement. My father was excitedly tugging on my arm, half dragging me through the wall of Secret Service agents, to talk with President Ford. I looked around nervously as my father made the necessary arrangements with Ford to prostitute me to him later that evening. Vande rJagt, who never missed a parade it seemed, was signing autographs. As he smiled at me, someone roughly grabbed my arm. Nervous and startled, I screamed. The crowd laughed as a Keystone Cop threw me in the jail, scol ding me for not wearing my red flannel underwear when I was talking to the President. I was trying to be inconspicuous in hopes no one would see me with the likes of Ford, but then, they did not know him as I did. The Keystone Cop rattled on and on about \"how lucky\" I was until my father paid my bail and I was released from the cell. That night, I wore my Catholic unif orm as instructed and went into a dissociative trance as my father drove me to the local National Guard Armory where I was prostituted to Ford. Ford took me into an empty room, pushed me down on the wooden floor as he unzipped his pants and said, \"Pray on this\". Then he brutally, sexually assaulted me. Afterward, my memory was compartmentalized through use of hi gh voltage. I was then carried out to the car where I lay in the back seat, muscles contracted, stunned, in pain, and unable to move. When we got back to Muskegon, my fath er sent me to the beach as always, to let the repetition of crashing waves against the beach \"wash my mind free of memory\" while I watched the sun set. I was totally locked into the belief that truly there was \"no place to run,\" not even to the President of the United States. I remember that the \"sane\" part of \"me\"-my innate personality-seemed to die after seeing Ford as President. I r ecall walking up the steps of Catholic Central High School one morning, reaching for the door, and crying uncontrollably. I cried myself into a heap at the top of the stairs. I did not even know why I was crying. As an MPD, I rarely cried at al l. But I was still sobbing hours later when school let out. Someone found me, but I do not recall to this day ever leaving the school step s. I never really experienced \"emotion\" after that day until I was rescued, deprogrammed and reintegrated in 1988. Now all of my brain was functioning th rough a wide variety of memory com- partments, also known as multiple personalities, with no part of me left \"free\" of abuse. Now it was as though I had \"no place to run,\" not even in my brain. This drove me out of my mind which is exactly what my abusers needed for total control. "},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"CHAPTER4 THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME When I learned of a pending rendezvous with Senator Byrd in Traverse City, Michigan (VanderJagt's headquarters), I stole some candy at a local convenience market hoping to go to jail and escape my encounter with Byrd. I was caught, and the police were even called. But, of course, my poetically powerful abusers would not allow for me to have a police record. The entire matter was not-so-mysteriously and sudd enly dropped. My only \"punishment\" was to have a conference with the school principal, Father Vesbit. Father Vesbit knew I was part of Proj ect Monarch, and handled the matter accordingly. He raped me in the school 's private chapel after school while holding a Satanic ritual involving severa l of my project friends. Kids often attached nicknames to their teachers, and there were only a few of us who knew the reason why Father Vesbit was called Father \"Fuzzbutt\". His backside was covered with thick black hair. He \"coun seled\" me on several occasions, once remarking, \"I thought kids in your situ ation were all part of the Exchange Student program.\" My Uncle Bob Tanis was visiting our hou se soon after that. He had flown in from what he claimed was a \"black op s\" Air Force Intelligence operation. I know now that in typical CIA mode of operations, he was relating a story of lies salted with some truth. His point was to inform me that the Catholic Church is \"justified\" in its involvement with our government due to the Priests' \"hearing confessions from mobsters and spies\". He also explained that Exchange Students were \"spies in the making\" th at Priests found, th rough Confession, were problems. Thus they were consid ered expendable and transferred out of the country. He then suggested to my father that I see the school guidance counselor, CIA Operative Dennis De Laney, immediately. My father enthusiastically told me that DeLane y was a long time friend of his from St. Francis who \"knew how to handle kids like me\". Arrangements were made for me to see him after school. DeLaney began by informing me that he was \"aware of everything\" and that he knew just what I needed \"to put me ba ck on track\". He said that my family needed to lake a trip to the Teton M ountains of Wyoming. He even provided maps and information in an envelope for my father. He turned off the lights in his office, and turned on a slide projec tor. He showed me scenes of the numerous waterfalls of the Tetons, all of which were to \"wash my brain\" of the reality that I was performing oral sex on him as ordered while the slides ran. Then he scheduled a follow up appointment for further \"counseling\". This trip to the Tetons would provide a change of scenery tram the usual Mackinac/Niagara Falls trip, but I could no longer hope for a change in the direction life was leading me. I was told my life was \"predestined,\" and all I had to do was follow the road stretched out before me, i.e., the \"Yellow Brick Road\". I was destined for Wyoming, but would not know why until I arrived. I confirmed the family trip to the Tetons when 1 saw DeLaney for my follow up \"counseling\". He informed me that he had already talked to my father about the trip, as well as our upcoming trip to Disney World in Florida. I was not surprised to learn of an additional trip . Nor did I have the capacity to become excited, suspicious, or apprehensive. I was aware that DeLaney was heavily "},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"involved in Project Mona rch, not only because he was accessing my sexual personalities again, but because he was helping to pave the way toward my destiny of total mind control. During Christmas vacation of 1974, my father flew us all to Disney World by route of Tampa, Florida. Ignorant of geography, it did not occur to me that Tampa was out of the way to Disney Worl d until my father drove the rented van to the gates of MacDill Air Force Base . Military personnel met me there and escorted me into the base TOP SECRET high tech mind-control conditioning facility for \"behavioral modification\" pr ogramming. This was the first in what became a routine series of mind-control testing and/or programming sessions on government installations that I would endure throughout my Project Monarch victimization. Whether I was in a military, NASA, or government building, the procedure for maintaining me under total mind control remained consistent with Project Monarch requirements. This included prior physical and/or psychological trauma; sleep, food, and water deprivation; high voltage electric shock; and hypnotic and/or harmonic programming of specific memory compartments/ personalities. The high tech equipmen t and methodisms I endured from that time on gave the U.S. government absolute control of my mind and life. I had been literally driven out of my conscious mind and existed only through my programmed subconscious. I lost my free will, ability to reason, and could not think to question anything that was ha ppening to me. I could only do as I was told. After the MacDill Air Force Base experience, my home life worsened. The controls and conditioning that my fath er and mother executed on me tightened even more. I was no longer permitte d to have any contact with my own brothers and sister (I only had one younger sister at that time). This stopped me in my subconscious efforts to protect them from my father's abuse, and left me with a desperate, empty aching for the loving relationships I previously shared with them. Of course, I never was able to protect them any more than I could defend myself or later protect my own daughter. However, until government programming began, 1 had routinely \"ba by sat\" them every evening and took them for long walks that lasted for hours in my feeble attempt to keep them out of my parents' range. Subconsciously I believed I was making a difference. The day my youngest brother told my mother he much preferred my company over hers was the day I could no longer be near him or my other brothers and sister. Apparently I was making enough of a difference that my parents were compelled to separate me from them. I wa s ordered to my closet-sized bedroom in the garage as soon as I got home fro m school or work. I could not speak to, look at, or hug my brothers and sister. I was not permitted to eat dinner with my family, although they let me out of my room to set the table, wash dishes, and do other chores. If I ventured from my bedroom to use the bathroom and was caught by my mother, she said, \"nobody rattled your cage\" and ordered me back to my room in the garage. In the summer of 1975, my family dr ove all the way from Michigan to the Teton Mountains of Wyoming. I was ordered to ride in the back storage area of the family Chevy Suburban since 1 was forbidden to associate or communicate with my brothers and sister. So I dissociated into books, or into the metaphorical, hypnotic suggestions from my father and tranced deeper as I watched the prairies seemingly endless se a of \"amber waves of grain\" streak past my window. Once when we stoppe d at a gas station, my father took me "},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"inside to show me a stuffed \"jackal ope\" mounted on the wall. Due to my tranced, dissociative state and high sugges tibility level, I believed it was indeed a cross between a jack rabbit and antelope. It was 100+ degrees in the Badlands when it cooled down at night. The intense heat of the day accentuated my ever increasing thirst. My father was physically preparing me though water deprivation for the intense tortures and programming I would endure in Wyoming, Dick Cheney, then White House Chief of Staff to president Ford, later Secretary of Defense to President George Bush, documented member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), and Presidential hopeful for 1996, was originally Wyoming's only Congressman. Dick Cheney was the reason my family had traveled to Wyoming where I endured yet another form of brutality— his version of \"A Most Danger ous Game,\" or human hunting. It is my understanding now that A Most Dangerous Game was devised to condition military personnel in survival and combat maneuvers. Yet it was used on me and other slaves known to me as a means of further conditioning the mind to the realization there was \"no plac e to hide,\" as well as traumatize the victim for ensuing programming. It was my experience over the years that A Most Dangerous Game had numerous vari ations on the primary theme of being stripped naked and turned loose in the wilderness while being hunted by men and dogs. In reality, all \"wilderness\" areas were enclosed in secure military fencing whereby it was only a matter of time until I was caught, repeatedly raped, and tortured. Dick Cheney had an apparent addictio n to the \"thrill of the sport\". He appeared obsessed with playing A Mo st Dangerous Game as a means of traumatizing mind-control victims, as well as to satisfy his own perverse sexual kinks. My introduction to the game occu rred upon arrival at the hunting lodge near Greybull, Wyoming, and it physically and psychologically devastated me. I was sufficiently traumati zed for Cheney's programmi ng as I stood naked in his hunting lodge office after being hunted down and caught. Cheney was talking as he paced around me, \"I could stuff you and mount you like a jackalope and call you a two legged dear. Or I could stuff you with this (he unzipped his pants to reveal his oversized penis) ri ght down your throat, and then mount you. Which do you prefer? Blood and sweat became mixed with the dirt on my body and slid like mud down my legs and shoulder. I throbbed with exhaustion and pain as I stood unable to think to answer such a question. \"Make up your mind,\" Cheney coaxed. Unable to speak, I remained silent. \"You don't get a choice, anyway, I make up your mind for you. That's why you're here. For me to make you a' mind, and make you mine/mind. You lo st your mind a long time ago. Now I ' m going to give you one. Just like the Wizard (of Oz) gave Scarecrow a brain, the Yellow Brick Road led you he re to me. You've 'come such a long, long way' for your brain, and I will give you one,\" The blood reached my shoes and caught my attention. Had I been further along in my programming, 1 perhaps woul d never have noticed such a thing or had the capability to think to wipe it away. But so far, I had only been to MacDill and Disney World for governme nt/military programming. At last, when I could speak, I begged, \"If you don't mind, can I please use your bathroom?\" Cheney's face turned red with rage. He was on me in an instant, slamming my back into the wall with one arm acr oss my chest and his hand on my throat, "},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"choking me while applying pressure to th e carotid artery in my neck with his thumb. His eyes bulged and he spit as he growled, \"If you don't mind me, I will kill you. I could kill you—Kill you—with my bare hands. You're not the first and you won't be the last. I'll kill you any time I goddamn well please,\" He flung me on the cot-type bed that was behind me. There he finished taking his rage out on me sexually. On the Long trip back to Michigan, I lay in a heap behind the scats of the Suburban, nauseated and hurting from Cheney's brutality and high voltage tortures, plus the whole Wyoming experience. My father stopped by the waterfalls flowing through the Tetons to \"wash my brain\" of the memory of Cheney, I could barely walk through the woods to the falls for the process as instructed, despite having learned my lessons well from Cheney on following orders. The next year when our \"annual\" trip to Disney World rolled around, my father drove, pulling his new Holiday Rambler Royale International trailer. (I slept outside in a tent because I was not permitted inside it since \"I wasn't family\".) My father dropped me off en route at the Kennedy Space Center in Titusville, Florida where I was subjected to my first NASA programming. From then on, I was \"obsessed\" with following the \"Yellow Brick Road\" to Nashville, Tennessee. Moving to Nashv ille was all I could talk about. If anyone asked me the question I could not think to ask myself \"Why?\", I would respond by reiterating it was something \"I had to do\". I had gone through the motions of my se nior year in a dissociative trance. I became further distanced from religious values by my religion class teacher. Brother Emmett. This was due to his promotion of cannibalism via Pier Paul Reed's book Alive, and by his teachings at a religious 'corseal' retreat I attended that included occult ritual at S T . Francis Church. I graduated from Muskegon Catholic Central High School in our bicentennial year of 1976. I was led by Senator Byrd to revise my plan to at tend Hope College like I had promised VanderJagt as a child. This new plan was for me to temporarily attend Muskegon Community College, because my \"real education\" was to come through mind-control programming-not schoo l. In order to be exhausted, as was necessary for my \"real education,\" I worked three menial jobs in addition to attending college. During my first semester of college in 1976, I made plans to take a trip to Nashville with my Project Monarch friend from Catholic Central. (She remains an expendable victim to date, and therefore her identity must be protected from public release for her safety.) My father explained that I was to stay at the Fiddler's Inn in Nashville, see the World Famous Printer's Alley row of sleazy country music nightclubs, and attend the Grand Ole Opry on Friday night, as ticket arrangements had been made through a \"friend,\" in spite of their scarcity during the Thanksgiving holiday. I never thought to associate Fiddler's I nn with Senator Byrd's fiddle playing when my friend and I arrived in Musi c City, U.S.A. Nor did 1 find it odd when a country music \"star\" entertaini ng at the Black Poodle nightclub in Printer's Alley began directing my activ ities. My friend and 1 were provided with free passes to the Black Poodle to encourage us to return each night where entertainer and CIA operative Jack Greene and his Desperado band were playing. During breaks between sets, Greene and his band would sit with my friend and me to manipulate our sugges tible minds. I was told it was \"my destiny\" to have met band member, Wayne Cox, who had been trained for "},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"paramilitary mercenary operations under Louisiana's U.S. Senator J, Bennett Johnston, I soon learned that everyone associated with Greene was involved in his CIA \"Freedom Train\" operations. When I told Greene that my friend and I would not be returning on Friday night due to attending the Grand Ole Opry, he told us that he would be working the Opry that night. He made arrangements for us to come back stage and see him immediately following his segment. He explained that the \"security\" guard at the Opry, Nashville Metro Police Lt. Bob Ezell, was a good friend of his and would let us in. At the Opry, my friend and I sat in the audience watching as Jack Greene introduced his \"special gue st,\" U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd. At the sight of Byrd, I went into a pre-conditioned deep trance and robotically went through the motions of following Greene's instruc tions. Once backstage, Greene pointed out his dressing room, which he was shar ing with Senator By rd, and ordered me in. The personality that had been sitting in the audience had perceived Byrd as an entertainer and could not, or would not, think further. But as I walked into the dressing room and saw Byrd perched on the edge of the mirrored vanity in his boxer shorts, I switched into the ch ild personality that had known him as a U.S. Senator on Mackinac Island since age 13, and responded sexually. Afterward, Byrd was claiming me as \"h is,\" excitedly telling me that he had \"always wanted his own little witch\" . I soon learned the enormity of this statement. Jack Greene's band member, Wayne Cox, later told me that playing music behind Senator Byrd at the Opry was not the only way he \"backed him\". He also backed him politically and in Freedom Train operations. Cox then made arrangements for my friend and me to st ay the remainder of our trip at his trailer in Hendersonville, Tennessee. There was no choice but to comply. The following night, after Jack Greene comp leted his show at the Black Poodle, he drove my friend and me to a nearby participating af ter-hours club, the Demon's Den. There, Cox was to pick us up and ta ke us to Hendersonville. Instead, we were slipped a drug and taken \"on a tour\" of Union Station, Nashville's then abandoned train station, where supposedl y the only train still running through there was the Freedom Train. Senator Byrd's attempted cultivation of superstition through my Catholic schooling should have maximized the impact of the occult ritual I was subjected to in the tower of the old stone and sl ate turn-of-the-century train depot. But the pain and horror was sufficiently effective in itself—even without my adhering to superstition-to produce th e intended mind shattering results. Cox took my friend and me on a \"flashlight tour\" through the rubble of Union Station, until we came to a homeless ma n sleeping on the ground. Cox ordered me to \"kiss the railroad bum good-bye,\" then shot him between the eyes while I was still only inches away 1 . He then used a machete to chop off the man's hands, which he put in a zip-lock bag. He then led us up the rickety stairs into the lower of the old depot. There Jack Greene, his band members, and others dressed in black robes were gathered around a black leather alter in a room lit by candles and draped in red velvet. In total shock, I was laid on the alter and subjected to rape and torture while the participants indulged in sex, blood, and cannibalism ritual. The next day I woke up on Cox's couch, vaguely aware that I had suffered a \"bad nightmare\". When I stood up, I passed out from blood loss. I was bleeding profusely from the vagina. It was all I could do to prepare to drive back to Michigan, and my friend was certainly not in a stable frame of mind to "},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"help. I did not know what happened to me, nor was I able to question it. I had a new \"obsession\" on my mind. I had been programmed at the ritual to move to Nashville and marry Cox, as ordered by Senator Byrd. Back in Michigan, I made the ann ouncement to my parents that I was moving to Nashville to marry Cox, as it was \"predestination\". What they would not tell me was that my father had just literally SOLD me to Senator Byrd in exchange for lucrative militar y contracts that made him a millionaire overnight—a millionaire on a sixth grade education—a perverse, child exploiting criminal, immune from prosecution, wo rking as a CIA operative for the U.S, government! That mind shattering occult ritu al I endured in Nashville marked a new life of wealth and prestige for my father white thrusting me into a new phase of my torturous existence-and I had no choice in any of it! 1 Nashville Metropolitan Po lice Lieutenant Bob Ezell, who also acted in the capacity of Grand Ol' Opry security guar d, covered up the murder. "},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 TINKERING WITH THE MIND It was 1977. I was a 19-year-old mind-controlled programmed slave in the CIA/DIA Project Monarch Freedom Train operation, literally owned by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd , who was then a 20-year incumbent and on the Senate Appropriations Committee, As Byrd's \"own little witch\" (sex slave), I would also become involved in covert government operations. I now understand that this required more memory compartments/personalities than I had developed. Hence one more reason fo r the mind shattering occult ritual, and my \"predestined\" marriage to Cox. In typical Project Monarch structure, Byrd was my \"owner\" and in control of my life, while Cox became my primary \"handler\" and followed Byrd's orders to ensure that 1 was at key locations and events at appointed times and to ma intain me under mind control. Cox reportedly was not paid cash for his role like my father was. Instead, he either followed orders or would be prosecut ed for distributing drugs and being the occult serial killer that he was and is to date. Cox's primary role was to shatter my mind further through repealed occult trauma as well as father my daughter, Kelly, to be raised in the genetic mi nd-control studies of Project Monarch. I moved to Nashville, as ordered, to marry Cox, who took me to the backwoods of his hometown swamp in Chatham, Louisiana for months at a time for occult traumatization. Cox had b een brought up in witchcraft by his mother, and admittedly longed for her sexually and ritually. Together they subjected me to their beliefs, which included what equates to a weakened version of mind control used by witches for centuries, anchored in superstition rather than scientific fact. These superstitious beliefs seemingly conflicted with Cox's mercenary training to the point th at his killing raged out of control. For example, Cox would murder a human through repeated stabbing with a knife, believing that the \"departing spirit\" a nd splattered blood gave him power to control my mind. In truth, it was my aversion and subsequent traumatization by the event that caused me to dissociate and trance, leaving my subconscious open to his suggestions and those of others. During the three years I was with Cox, he ritually impregnated and aborted me six times, consuming several of his own offspring and preserving the others shaped in ceramic for sale in his interstate occult body parts business. Cox's M.O. for murdering always included removing the hands with a machete, as th e \"Hands of Glory\" he kiln-dried in the ceramic shop of his and his mother's house were in demand and thus distributed throughout the occult underground supply network. Cox's protected cocaine and body parts distribution routes included Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Florida. Cox and I traveled to Florida on severa l occasions as his mother's parents lived in Mims, which is only minutes away from the NASA Kennedy Space Center in Titusville. Cox, like my father, made sure I was there for mind- control testing and programming as ordered. Cox perceived me as a \"Chosen One,\" and often used this CIA Project M onarch term when referring to me and for proudly \"justifying\" his leaving me at the NASA installation. Cox had a variety of belief systems that he applied to various situations, all of which were superstition based. He believed in spirit communication or \"divine guidance\" through nature sp irits and demons, that Satan must be "},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"appeased, that Jesus is an alien, that the Bermuda Triangle is a door to another dimension, and that the end of the world is near. He 'religiously' carried a Bible with him everywhere-including to occult rituals-quoting scripture like a theologian. He justified \"eating th e body and drinking the blood,\" \"being washed in the blood,\" and even \"murdering children\" according to the story of God testing Abraham by ordering him to murder his son, Isaac, by knife on an alter. Jim Jones was one of Cox's idols, as was Charlie Manson, and he touted the Jonestown massacre as a prime ex ample of the \"power of (CIA) mind control\". Cox demanded I become a Mormon in th e Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. This was to \"prove\" that Sa tan was everywhere-particularly in the Monroe, Louisiana Mormon church wher e he led occult ritual, and in the Hendersonville, Tennessee church that the so-called Freedom Train rolled through. 1 Cox's determination to instill his religious superstitious beliefs in me was side-tracked by J. Bennett Johnston in hi s Shreveport, Louisiana office early in the summer of 1978. Cox's mother, Mary, had driven us to Johnston's office near Barksdale Air Force Base as ordered. As she knocked boldly on the obscure metal door, 1 read the attached metal sign: \"General Dynamics Research and Development\". A smaller sign near the doorknob read; \"U nlawful to enter premises without prior authorization. All violators will be prosecuted under penalty of federal law.\" Johnston, wearing a light blue, leisure suit and smelling strongly of body odor, opened the door. \"Well, hey Senato r,\" Mary drawled in her backwoods Louisiana dialect, \"I brought th e children to see you like you said.\" Johnston looked at her with annoyed disgust. \"I see that,\" he said matter-of- factly. He then proceeded to instruct Ma ry to wait outside a moment while he talked with Cox, then to take him on to her home in Monroe where I could be picked up at the Airport a few days later. Cox and I were ushered into Johnston's barren military-style furnished office. Several Presidential and mi litary photographs hung on the wall and served as the only decor. Johnston sat on the front of his military issue desk and talked to Cox's subconscious mi nd using cryptic, hypnotic Disney Peter Pan theme language, 3 as he apparently had done in the past when Cox had a mind left to control. \"As long as your ticker's running, ch at crock-a-dial you've been feeding over the years will be running right behind you. (Peter) Pan knew how to stay a step ahead of the game and stop the inevitable process of becoming gator bait himself by offering to give him a hand now and then.\" Cox dismembered his murdered victims and distributed the \"Hands of Glory\" to fellow Satanists and occult traumatized/ Peter Pan theme programmed mercenaries, while feeding \"left over\" body pa rts to an alligator that lived in the Swamp behind his house. This was indi cative of Cox's twisted, murderous response to Johnston's traumati c Peter Pan theme programming... a programming that I was about to experience \"first hand\". Cryptically instructing Cox on Senator Byrd's orders, Johnston continued, \"I've got to hand it to that Pan. His livelihood of creating hookers for the Captain (Hook) was indeed lucrative. And speaking of creating hookers, a little Byrd told me that a shift from routine ha nd-ling to a theme that is alien could prove lucrative to you.\" Revealing his intent to ensure my military mind- "},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"control programming, Johnston told him, \"I'll lay a little groundwork and set the patten for countdown. Then I'll se nd her out to launch for you, and it's your job to man the craft from there...\" Cox was ordered out of Johnston's office, and he turned his full attention to me. When alone with the Senator, Johnston manipulated my mind, and ultimately my beliefs and perceptions, for future programming. He referred to a picture of himself shaking hands with unknown Navy brass as he dramatically told me, \"I was there that fateful day in 1943 when a hole was ripped in the fabric of time through what later became known as the Philadelphia Experiment. All those fine boys vanished along with their ship in a bizarre twist of events that parallels the Atlantis disappearances. A vortex was created in an effort to slip dimensions and b ecome invisible to the enemy. It was a success beyond the highest expectations and launched us all into universal travel. It is no wonder at all that we have had a man on the moon. Traveling to distant planets and galaxies is Mickey Mouse stuff in comparison to the high tech wizardry of trans-dimensiona l travel. Trans-dimensional travel circumvents all measures of time, including distance and speed. When the fabric of time was torn, we opened ourselves up to intergalactic travel—both in and out of this dimension - and in and out of the future, as well as the past. We can alter the course of history by travelin g back in time to alter events, or we can blast off into the future and gain wisdom and knowledge of events yet to come. We can control the future by contro lling the past. At present, this is a relatively easy task according to the theory of relativity and abilities gained through the Philadelphia Experiment. I ca me back an ET (extraterrestrial) myself. And our ship relumed to this Earth as a spaceship. 3 I gained the keys to the universe on that fateful day, and I carry them with me now, sharing only a Key or two at a time with those who are Chosen. You are a Chosen One (Johnston was deliberately interfacing with Rite to Remain Silent conditioning), and therefore must learn the ins and outs of interplanetary travel. Your mission is trans-dimensional. You can span in finite dimensions by learning from me. Take it from me, you're going places, kid. And I ' l l teach you to get there by riding the light. I'll teach you the gro undwork, and you do the light work. The key to the universe lies in the speed of light. The only way to travel is by beam of light. You will learn to go to the light... Your mission is to learn how to Tinker with time. I'm going to take you on that journey myself. Come with me now. It's time we were leavi ng this plane and boarding another.\" Johnston took me the short distance fr om his General Dynamics Corporation provided office to the Barksdale Air Fo rce Base airfield. He was apparently well known at Barksdale, and a small cargo plane was ready to lake us to our destination-Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma. Once we were airborne, Johnston accessed my sex programmed personalities for his own aggressive perversion. His use of cocaine further accentuated his hyperactive demeanor as he brutally slung me around the back of the small plane while he had sex with me. At one point the pilot hollered from the cockpit \"Hey, you're creating turbul ence. Knock it off, will you.\" Johnston laughed and responded, \"What the fuck do you think I'm doing?\" By the time we arrived at Tinker A.F.B., my arm was beginning to show a dark bruise that extended from my shoul der to my elbow. A uniformed man greeted us as we walked across the airfield. Johnston apparently knew him quite well, and referred to him as \"Cap'n\" (which tied in with the Peter Pan "},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"theme programming I was about to endure). When he noticed my arm, Cap'n reminded him, \"Hey, that's not necessary, you know.\" \"Yeah, I know. Take care of it for me. Here...\" Johnston took the straps of my tank top and pulled them down around my forearms (which still could not cover the bruise.) \"There, that just about covers it.\" He smiled and continued, \"You look like a Southern belle that way rather than a damned ol' Yankee anyway,\" Cap'n said, \"She'll be a Tinker-belle by the time we're through here today.\" Then, referring to Johnston's primary purpose in actually escorting me to Tinker he asked, \"How are your South American operations progressing?\" \"I've got to talk to you about that,\" Johnston answered. The two talked as though they had worked in tandem on given mercenary operations/assignments in the past. \"I may need a few of yo ur boys to back me on something.\" \"Back you, or cover you?\" the Cap'n retorted. Johnston laughed, \"Both if you'll front the operation.\" Johnston had previously \"justified\" hi s use of Tinker (Peter Pan theme) programmed niind-controlled mercenarie s to me by saying, \"Mercenaries are missionaries who follow their inner guidance system rather than their old Uncle Sam. Politics hinder the route to freedom, and these boys slip under international laws, undetected, to ca rry out the work th e military boys only dream of doing..\" I was escorted away from the two by a nurse, who purported to be tending to my injured arm. In fact, she was pr eparing me for the \"Tinker-belle cage\" 4 — an electrified metal cage with an electrified grid bottom. Locked inside, 1 was subjected to high, direct current volt age to compartmentalize the Peter Pan theme mind-control programming that 1 endured. Like Peter Pan's Tinkerbelle, I learned to \"ride the light\" as a means of travel. 5 Additionally, my instilled Tinker-belle theme mind manipulation included a sense of Never-Never-land timelessness that was rooted to my \"n atural\" inability to comprehend time due to my MPD/D1D. Back in Louisiana, Cox and I shared a subconscious understanding of Peter Pan themes and \"riding the light\". The difference between us was that Cox consciously activated Tinker Air Force Base programming within Johnston's band of mercenaries, while my trance was perpetual whereby I could \"Never- Never-Land.\" 6 I was with Cox on numerous occasions when he was running guns and/or cocaine, and activating specified mercenar ies for operations as instructed by Johnston, In the course of these travels I saw numerous underground arsenals and stockpiled weapons that were known to Senator Johnston, but were not on. military installations. I was also pr ivy to government sanctioned cocaine operations. On one such cocaine run in 1979, I trav eled with Cox to a remote area in the Ouachita National Forest near Hot Springs, Arkansas to \"watch for fairies like Tinker-belle\" and \"ride the light\". We sat in the brush near a railroad track until we saw a light approaching from the Eastern sky. At the time I thou ght I would be \"riding the light\" as I was led to believe, but in retrospect I recall my personalities being deliberately switched and a helicopter landing in a nearby clearing. Cox and I unloaded approximately 200-400 pounds of cocai ne from the van he had driven, and stacked it in the helicopter. We were then flown to a small airport that appeared to be no more than a dark, fenced-in clearing where 1 saw a row of "},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"metal buildings that looked like mini- warehouses. While the cocaine was unloaded into a warehouse, Cox and I were taken by car to a nearby grey stone hold. The driver led us upstairs, and knocked on the Penthouse door. \"Yeah,\" a voice answered, \"I got a Tinker-belle and a Peter Pan here to see you, Sir,\" the driver called. \"Send 'em in.\" Cox and I walked into the suite where then Governor of Arkansas Bill Clint cm was shuffling through a briefcase. Clinton and Johnston were cohorts in illegal covert operations that emanated from Tinker Air Force Base. Cox spoke up. \"Senator Johnston said a little (Senator) Byrd told him that you are one of Ours.\"' \"So what does that make you?\" Clinton asked impatiently. \"A Chosen One,\" Cox nodded his head toward me. Clinton asked me, \"Chosen by whose order?\" I cryptically delivered the proper co ded response, which cued Clinton to proceed. \"What brings you here?\" he demanded. Interpreting his question literally as is \"natural\" for programmed MPD/DID slaves, I answered, \"I rode the light, Sir.\" Clinton rolled his eyes, and looked back over at Cox who was nervously rocking back and forth as he so often did. \"State your business,\" Clinton ordered. \"Uh,\" Cox cleared his throat, habitually picked his nose as he rocked back and forth and said, \"Well, uh...\" Clinton looked disgusted. \"Get him the fuck out of here!\" he ordered the driver. Cox was im- mediately escorted out, \"That's better,\" Clinton said. Using standard Jesuit hand signals and cryptic language, he triggered/switched me and accessed a previously programmed message. \"Senator Johnston sent me to give th is to you.\" I handed Clinton a thin, large brown envelope, \"And I have some fairy dust guaranteed to make you fly high.\" I took the personal stash of co caine that Johnston was sharing with Clinton from my pocket. Clinton snorted two lines of the coke immediately. He smiled. \"Tell Ben I'm impressed.\" He showed me to the door. The severe torture and mind-control programming that I was enduring at Tinker Air Force Base had prepared me for this simple \"mission\" and many others. Although Cox's out-of-control occult serial killings polyfragmented my multiple personalities as intended by By rd, it was Johnston's alien theme mind conditioning that locked me into absolute robotic helplessness. After all, had I been capable of rationalizing, I would nave found that the thought of interdimensional travel and aliens was no more bizarre to me that Cox's murderous actions or having found out pornography king Jerry Ford held the office of President. When my daughter, Kelly, was born in February of 1980, Cox's former employer. Jack Greene, traveled to Louisi ana to meet with me in keeping with his role as Nashville's CIA Freedom Tr ain \"conductor\". He took me aside and explained that since Cox had fulfilled his (genetic) role in producing Kelly, Senator Byrd had ordered me back to Nashville. Greene talked at length, hypnotically reviving my original programmed \"obsession\" to move to Nashville. He told me that Cox had proven too insane to follow orders anymore as was evidenced by my extremely poor health (much of my hair bad "},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"fallen out) and by the stench of decayin g human flesh that permeated the area surrounding his remote Chat ham, Louisiana swamp house. If I had had a mind of my own, I know in retrospect I would have felt as though 1 had been released from a pris on dungeon. But I could only respond by telling Cox matter-of-factly that I had received \"divine guidance\" to move to Nashville at once to a home that awaited me. Cox had no choice but to comply with Byrd's orders. Kelly and I moved to Tennessee when she was only three months old, and Cox temporarily moved with us in order to apprise our new handler of the latest details of our vi ctimization. Within weeks, Cox moved back to Chatham, Louisiana to live with his mother (even to this date). Now he reportedly raises goats for sacrifice and carries on his occult serial killing activities unhindered due to his immunity from prosecution because of whom and what he and his mother know. 1 Substantial information regarding the satura tion of occultism in th e Mormon church is a published fact, circulated among the Bishopric, th en released by Bishop Pa ce in on effort to restore morality and freedom of thought to church members. 2 Senator Johnston's dual and triple cryptic language perplexed me at the time. In retrospect, I understand how th is component of mind cont rol allowed for undetected proliferation of criminal covert activity, even when overheard by strangers, to the extent that I believed it must be occurring in \"a nother dimension\" as I was told. 3 Johnston \"validated\" his ploy in my mind by arra nging for me to see his \"space-ship\"-a then TOP SECRET experimental aircraft which would eventually be known as a Stealth fighter- at a military installation near Bato n Rouge. The classified triangul ar Stealth was so alien to me at the time that it looked more like a spaceship than the U.S. fi ghter plane it actually is. This, in combination with his inhumane demeanor an d my previously instilled belief in trans- dimensional travel, convinced me he was the \"ET\" he purported to be. 4 I understand this is referr ed to as a Woodpecker grid. 5 \"Riding the Light\" scrambled my future experience of being transported by military helicopter or airplane to robotically carry out some program for the government. This \"trance- dimeasional\" travel caused my earthly experiences to be perceived as having occurred in another dimension. 6 I remained in a Post Traumatic Stress Diso rdered (PTSD) trance. 7 Same Jesuit reference used to describe Pierre Trudeau."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 UNITED STATES MILITARY & NASA MIND-CONTROL TRAINING Soon after moving to Tennessee, I learned that Senator Byrd had simply exchanged one living hell for another for me. My new mind-control handler, CIA operative and country music ventriloquist/ stage hypnotist Alex Houston, seemed only to pick up where Cox had left off. As \"destined,\" Kelly and I moved into a run-down old trailer on Houston's property, which adjoined Jack Greene's farm in Goodletsville, Tennessee. I was subjected to further occult ritual on Greene's farm, and was ritually impregnated and aborted again, this time by Houston. A difference between Cox and Houston was the superstition factor; Houston knew exactly what he was doing and why he was doing it, in accordance with tried and proven scie ntific U.S. Government mind-control research and development. I gleaned this knowledge from conversations I overheard between him and \"those in the know\". Alex Houston was 26 years older than I, and claimed to have gained his knowledge of stage hypnosis and government mind-control methods from the military while entertaining overseas in Bob Hope's US O tours. After the tour, Houston reportedly moved to Washington, D.C. where he and his alter-ego dummy, Elemer, were regulars on the Jimm y Dean television show in the '60s. 1 According to Houston, he was regularly booked to entertain in officers\" clubs on military bases due to his involvement in covert government operations. During the brief interim period that Co x resided on Houston's farm with us, he played music behind government mind- controlled slave Louise Mandrell and her husband/handler, R.C. Bannon. Cox had previously worked with Louise's sister, Barbara Mandrell, at the onset of her government sponsored career in the 1960s, traveling overseas with her in the same U.S,O. tours that launched Houston's career. Irby Mandrell, the Mandrells' father and manager, reportedly sexually abused all three of his daughters and eagerly thrust them into their mind-controlled existence much the same way my father had sold me. His daughters, too, were owned by U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd. Cox was soon fired from his position wi th Louise due to his insanity. Once when Houston was traveling with the Mandrells as he so often did throughout the years, Irby Mandrell relaye d the events that prompted his firing of Cox. He told Houston and I that Cox had become an embarrassment to him while traveling. \"I knew he was weird,\" Irby Mandrell said. \"That's OK. I can live with that. But when he pitched a tent behind the hotel so he could hear the trumpets sound, signaling him to march to Missouri, 2 I said, 'Start marching, son. You're done. You're through in Nashville. Don't ever come back.' That's it, he was done.\" Houston reminisced with Mandrell about the U.S.O. days, and inquired as to how he had tolerated Cox back wh en he played music behind Barbara. \"Oh, yeah. I remember he (Cox) had so mewhat of a brain back then.\" Irby Mandrell continued, \"Barbara was just a ki d back then with the talent of a full blown star. I thought she had what it take s to make it in the industry. Then the Byrd came along and introduced us to the latest in technology.\" "},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Houston interrupted, \"Are you talking about (music) equipment or the kind they've got in Huntsviile (Alabama's NASA mind-control training center)?\" \"Both,\" Mandrell replied. \"But it was Hu ntsville that launched her to the stars. The doors opened wide after that. Byrd took a lot of pride in Barbara, and the doors just kept opening. With my baby's talent and the Byrd's influence on her mind and career, there was no way we could lose.\" When Houston became my appointed min d-control handler in 1980, Byrd's influence on my mind boosted Houston's \"entertainment\" career. His travels had expanded to accommodate covert drug and money laundering operations across the U.S., in Mexico, in Canada, and throughout the Caribbean. Houston had, and has, a great deal of \"no show\" money, but I was never permitted access to it. Poverty was one more means of control I endured, as slaves like myself were not afforded the freedoms that having money allows. When I was working three menial jobs during college, all of my money was taken from me by my parents. All mone y earned by Cox's cocaine and body parts enterprises was reinvested in the coven and drugs, leaving us dependent on charities for our basic necessities. With H ouston, 1 had to \"earn\" every penny I spent on groceries and necessities over a nd over again, which made \"earning my keep\" a deliberately impossible cycle. This kept me financially dependent and further hindered my ability to escape, even if I had known enough to attempt it. My innate protective maternal instin cts as a mother may have been ac- centuated due to my past unsuccessful attempts to protect my brothers and sisters (I now had two sisters). It was my desperate need to keep Kelly safe that drove me to the point of \"fight or fli ght\" when I was transferred to Houston. I had long ago lost my ability to \"fight,\" but my new maternal instincts compelled me to \"flight\". I did all I could to save Kelly and myself from Houston and her fate in Project Monarch. Since I had no ability to reason and was amnesic, I \"fled\" to my parents' new house in af fluent Grand Haven, Michigan, I had no concept of what I was running from or to. I arrived with my baby daughter in my arms, the tattered clothes on our ba cks, and what few donated belongings I had acquired for Kelly. Within a few da ys, my parents received and followed Senator Byrd's instructions, and turned me back over to Houston—who, in turn, sent me back to Louisian a for further conditioning. After three more months of intense, nonstop tortures by Cox, 1 could not think to follow maternal instincts and barely knew my own name. I had no idea how old I was, where I was, how long I had been there, and what had happened to Kelly during that time, Kelly's ow n testimony and current programmed poly fragmented Multiple Personality/Dissociative Identity Disorder reflects the high tech, sophisticated conditioning and torturous trauma she endured during this and numerous ensuing times that we were separated. When 1 was returned to Houston as orchestrated by Byrd, my brain contained a series of new compartments ready to be programmed and led. Intensive mind-control behavior programming began at once, and Houston ensured that I was taken to my appointed destinations under the guise of his travels in the country music industry. In the early 1980s, my base programming was instilled at Fort Ca mpbell, Kentucky by U.S. Army Lt. Colonel Michael Aquino. Aquino holds a TOP SECRET clearance in the Defense Intelligence Agency's Psychologi cal Warfare Division (Psy Ops). He is a professed Neo-Nazi, the founder of the Himmler inspired satanic Temple of Set, and has been charged with child ritual and sexual abuse at the Presidio Day Care in San Francisco, California. But like my father and Cox, Aquino remains "},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"\"above the law\" while he continues to traumatize and program CIA destined young minds in a quest to reportedly create the \"superior race\" of Project Monarch Mind-Controlled slaves. I quickly teamed that Aquino did not adhere to his profoundly professed occult su perstition any more than I did. His \"satanic power\" was in the form of numerous variations of high voltage stun guns, 5 which he used on me regularly. Although Aquino used occultism (blood trauma) as a trauma base, his programming was high tech and \"clean\"—not muddled in a proverbial witches' brew of ignorance. He quickly dispelled the Cox influence, and began programming me according to Byrd's specifications as his \"own little witch\" for sadistic se x, covert CIA drug muling, black mail, and prostitution operations. During the three months I was back with Cox, a muscle in my upper vaginal wall was cut and dropped in preparati on for Houston to flesh carve a hideous witch's face 4 for Senator Byrd's perversion . Aquino provided the ancient instructions on how to mutilate me, and Houston used silver nitrate and hot exacto knives to carve the details of th e face without any form of anesthesia. By flexing the muscle downward, the fa ce protruded out of my vagina. Not only did this surgery give Byrd a vagi na suited to his minute, underdeveloped penis, it also provided an equitable \"curiosity\" to be displayed over and over again in both commercial and non-co mmercial pornography and prostitution. On the 1981 anniversary of John F. Kenne dy's assassination, I was forced to \"marry\" Alex Houston for appearance sa ke. Earlier that month when I had been taken to Washington, D.C for pros titution purposes, Byrd informed me that I would actually be \"marrying\" him when I \"pledged my vows\" to Houston. \"It is a covenant between the two of us ,\" Byrd had said, \"It is me that you will honor and obey 'til death do us part,\" Byrd then instructed me to pick up my wedding dress from a nearby D.C. store. Throughout the years, Houston often joked about the significance of my Washington, D.C. wedding dress— which was depicted in pornographic photos and a commercial video to \"commemorate our wedding night\", Alex Houston's \"best man,\" Jimmy Wal ker, was also a photographer for Larry Flynt's sexually graphic commercial pornography magazine, Hustler. When I met Byrd after the ceremony at Nashville's Opryland Hotel as ordered, he presented me with a \"wedding gift \"—a rose patterned crystal crucifix deliberately designed to anchor \"our we dding\" in my Catholic/Vatican instilled beliefs. The Larry Flynt photos depictin g me in my wedding dress with the crystal crucifix to \"commemorate our wedding night,\" was standard lock-in procedure for all mind-controlled slaves I knew who were forced to \"marry\" their handlers/owners. Houston's booking agent, Reggie Mac (MacLaughlin), of United Talent and later of MacFadden Agency in Nashv ille, Tennessee, had been booking CIA involved country music acts into key locations to aid the execution of covert government operations. For example, Houston's ventriloquist act \"Alex and Elemer\" would be scheduled to perform at a county or state fair near Washington, D.C., where I would be pi cked up by car or helicopter and escorted to the White House or the Pentagon. The ensuing activities would be compartmentalized in my memory in a manner that caused me to believe 1 had simply been traveling in the country music industry, and no one \"back home\" would be suspect of my absence. An other example would be that Houston \"entertained\" at Byrd's West Virginia State Fair every year, which gave a "},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"legitimate appearance to my presence there, when in fact I was being prostituted to the Senator I had \"married.\" During the early '80s, Reggie MacLa ughlin primarily booked Houston into areas that were conducive to my mi nd-control programming with Aquino. I was first subjected to Aquino's tortur es and programming in Fort Campbell, Kentucky; Fort McClellen in Anniston , Alabama; and most frequently, at Redstone Arsenal and Marshall Space Fl ight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Military mind-control was fast, effective, and highly technological, but it was the NASA programming that launched me as a \"Presidential Model\", Even though Aquino instilled my program ming on both military and NASA installations, he had access to the la test technological advancements and techniques through NASA. These included mind foolers such as sensory depri- vation tanks, virtual reality, flight simulators, and harmonics. By the age of two, Kelly had already been subjected to Aquino and his programming through these latest technological advancements , which shattered her fragile young mind before her base personality had a chance to form. Rather than use occultism on Kelly, Aquino traumatized her through sexual assault and high voltage tortures of the mind and body. She, like I, to th is day carries numerous scars from this \"non satanic\" abuse base. I know, from years of research, NASA technology and Aquino's programming, combined with the Project Monarch standard sleep, food, and water deprivation and high volta ge, made Kelly a subject of state of the art genetically multigenerationa l MPD/D1D psychological mind-control engineering. In 1981, Byrd personally joined Aquino in Huntsville, Alabama during one of our programming sessions. NASA coop erated fully with Byrd on any and everything, since it was Byrd's Sena te Appropriations Committee that determined how much and/or whether NASA received government funding. I lay naked on the cold metal table, tranced and photographically recording every word and detail of my programming and every word that Byrd and Aquino not so privately discussed. Byrd was provi ding Aquino with specific details of certain perversions he wanted me equipped to fulfill or perform. Additionally, they talked about scrambling my immedi ate memory with two private porn films they were arranging to have produced lo cally. These were titled How To Divide a Personality and How To Create a Sex Slave. These films are the kind NASA became involved in producing for the du al purpose of \"scrambling\" memory and documenting their mind-controJ pr ocedures. The resi dent Huntsville, Alabama pornographers were two local cops, one of which was (and is) a Sergeant. 5 This served NASA and the CIA well when cover-up was necessary. The How To Create a Sex Slave film depicts the common \"spin\" pro- gramming, which in essence is the combination to unlocking or accessing a specific programmed act. For example, th e compartment of the mind that holds memory of incest is stimulated to open when the original abuse is eminent. Seeing my father's penis would \"trigger\" a specific response, supposedly opening the neuron pathways of my brai n to allow the part of my brain that dealt with his actions before to deal with them again. With \"spin\" programming, the trigger of seeing my father's penis is replaced with a combination of specific verbal commands and a specific number of physical spins so that anyone with tbe \"combination\" could access that particular part of my brain. The part of my mind contai ning \"knowledge\" of the original abuse by my father learned to \"like\" painful, sadistic sex. Senator Byrd wanted me programmed in such a way that he could de cide if he wanted me to scream and "},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"cry when he whipped me, or if he want ed me to become sexually aroused and \"beg\" for more. After programming, wh en I met with Byrd, I would \"dance\" like a music box dancer, twirling round and round until Byrd's fiddle music stopped. My mind precisely calculated how many revolutions I had made whether I was capable of conscious counting or not (much like a normal person wakes up at a particular time without an alarm clock), and the desired results were produced as accessed. This is but one simplified example of sex programming, and I was programmed for more than sex. But this particular incident of programming at the U.S. Army Redstone Arsenal would change my existence entirely and set the stage for my role in covert government black, budget-type operations as a \"Presidential Model\". Seeing and/or knowing that Kelly was being tortured and programmed proved to be a detriment to my own mind-control programming, such that the common \"cross-programming\" of mother an d daughter was rarely viable. In the fall of 1982, Houston was scheduled to perform at the State Fair in Senator Byrd's home state of West Virginia, Byrd arrived at our hotel with L T . C OL . Aquino, who took Kelly with him, supposedly for programming purposes, I was left alone in the hotel room with Byrd, whose KKK affiliation fueled his rage over my having been recently pr ostituted to black entertainer and CIA operative Charlie Pride. Although I had had no control over th e situation to be- gin with, Byrd expended his fury on me rather than on Houston who was ultimately responsible for the incident. He took out his whip and began beating me as he had so many time s before. Only this time it seemed to last forever, Byrd was still whipping me when Aqui no returned with my tranced and traumatized daughter. I regained consci ousness enough to pull myself up off the floor when 1 heard Kelly's hysteric al cries. Byrd ordered me to the bathroom for a cold shower to stop the bleeding. My body could not carry out his orders, and I collapsed again in the bathroom, smearing blood all over the floor. Kelly's cries again revived me, a nd I crawled to the door to find Byrd sexually assaulting her and Aquino disrobing to join them. One small window in the bathroom appeared to be a possi ble means of escape to obtain help, but Byrd caught me and knocked me to the fl oor. The whole bathroom was smeared in blood by the time he threw me into the shower and turned the cold water on to slow the bleeding. Later that afternoon, Kelly and I stood hand in hand in the afternoon sun at the State Fair where Senator Byrd was about to make a speech to his. constituents. My blouse stuck to my freshly whipped skin as Byrd walked onto the stage, and the crowd cheered. Althou gh Byrd periodically sexually abused Kelly throughout her Project Monarch victimization, the horrific incident in- West Virginia was the last time 1 was able to instinctively think to respond at all. Aquino's mind-control programming further insured it, as did Byrd's access to high tech mind-control equipment via West Virginia's Jesuit College, where he claimed the role of \"Head Friar\". 6 Kelly has reported enduring much sexual abuse by both Byrd and Aquino. Aquino apparently incorporated sexual abuse with his mind-control programming and sex training of her, and shared more such events with Byrd. It was also my experience that Byrd's sexual perversions were heightened when Aquino shared in the assault. Trauma tic events such as this one in West Virginia reinforced my own programming through conditioning, and further locked me in to Byrd's seemingly inescapable control. "},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"The majority of my programming, as we ll as a large part of Kelly's, was again Oz theme based. This means the combination of codes, keys and triggers to access me were related to L. Fr ank Baum's story, The Wizard Of Oz. Whether or not it was Baum's intention (or for that matter Walt Disney's, Lewis Carroll's, etc.), it is evident that his psychologically intense story was used for manipulating minds. Much of The Wiza rd Of Oz lends itself to themes commonly used by perpetrators. For example, nearly all MPD/DIDs have suffered the loss of pets during rituali zed torture. And all of Baum's primary character Dorothy's nightmarish experiences \"over the rainbow in Oz\" stemmed from her desire to risk her own life to protect her threatened pet. Abusers use this lesson to condition the victim to drop all resistance and cooperate or \"I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog (o r child) too.\" The \"over the rainbow\" scramble of dreams vs. reality provides abusers a theme by which to manipulate an MPD's subconscious perception of sw itching personalities. Oftentimes this theme is transdimensional as is Oz, or that which was just experienced was \"just a bad dream\" like Dorothy was told upon her awakening in her own bed back in Kansas. CIA cryptic language is manipulation of the English language such that words have a double meaning (aka 'double binds' in mental health terminology.) It works much the way as communication through \"inside jokes\", among people familiar with each other. Perhaps this is a reason for the government's use of professional come dians as slave handlers. Since mind- controlled slaves' minds function consciously through their subconscious, which has no way of discerning fantasy from r eality or intended meaning from literal meaning, cryptic dual level language is especially effective. Many CIA covert operations I was involved in occurred in public. Anyone who overheard the conversation would have discerned someth ing very different from what actually \"trance-spired\". For example, one of my Washington, D.C. Secret Service escorts linked arms with me like Dorothy did wiih her companions when walking the Yellow Brick Road. This would have appeared to be normal behavior, or even romantic, to outsiders . But to me it was a signal to \"stay the course\" (Bush's quote) and follow dir ections. Arm in arm we walked through the crowded Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian to the nearby NASA headquarters. There he read the \"Service Entrance\" sign on the door accentuating syllables ever so slightly so that I heard him cryptically command, \"Serve-us, En-Trance\". 1 Jimmy Dean is knowledgeable of, and a willing participant in criminal covert activity including the use of mind-controlled slaves. 2 \"Marching to Missouri\" is a Mormon base d belief that interfaced with the CIA' S FACTION OF THE COUNTRY MUSIC industry being transferred to Br anson, Missouri in the mid 1980s. 3 120,000-volt stun guns leave two indented prod marks or moles tw o inches apart, while the cylindrical stun gun USED primarily in the vagina and rectum leaves prod marks/mole s 3/4 of an inch apart.. A look into trash-magazine publisher Larry Flint's Hustler will show prod marks on the mi nd-controlled slaves he photographs, particularly on the throat, near the lips. and on the back. 4 The \"witch's face\" has also been referred to as that of a baphomet and Jesuit monk. 5 I photo identified the Sergeant and hi s (jailer) officer in 1990, and Mark's and my lives were threatened through then-District Attorney, now U.S. Representative, Bud Cramer (D. Huntsville, Alab ama) of the Congressional Permanent Intelligence Committee as a result of this revelation! 6 To a literal mind-controlled MPD/DID sl ave, the term \"Head Priar\" equate s to \"head frier\", meaning high voltage to the brain. "},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 CHARM SCHOOL After Aquino instilled my base se x programming, I was often taken by Houston to Youngstown, Ohio to attend the sex slave training camp hell hole referred to as \"Charm School\". Houst on often performed in the Youngstown area at county fairs, Fraternal Order of Police shows, or any little country music entertainment gigs that would brin g us in the proximity of the dreaded Charm School. On occasion, Kelly woul d go through the torture process with me. But usually Houston delivered me to the door for training with other CIA and Mafia slaves my age, and then le ft taking Kelly with him. When Charm School was in session, there were seve ral girls being tortured and trained at once. 1 have seen and known numerous girls to go through Charm School, but, understandably, few are reported to have survived or recovered their minds enough to talk about it. Charm School was reportedly operated by an identified member of the. Mellon Banking family (Byrd's Endowment for the Arts' largest contributor). The operator took the name and role of \"Governor\" from the movie My Fair Lady, in an attempt to conf use my torturous reality with movie fantasy. In the movie, Governor is the cockney title given the professor who transformed a female street urchin into a functioning high society lady. Additionally, Mellon's use of the title, Governor, was intended to create scramble for the real Governor who frequented the school as though it were only a whore house. I am referring to then Governor of Pe nnsylvania (and later U.S. Attorney General, now secretary for the United Nations) Dick Thornburgh. 1 Aquino pro- vided some of the programming at Charm School and everyone I knew in government operations was at least aware of it. Then Youngstown Sheriff, now U.S. Representative Jim Traficant, was usually present. He capitalized on his ability to portray himself as \"Lurch\" by slowly opening the door and saying, \"Walk this way - To a literal slave in training, this means walk like he is walking-like Lurch, Egor, a street whore, Scarecrow, and so on. Once the door closed behind me. Charm School meant I would be charmed, mesmerized (hypnotized), and programmed to be a high class prostitute for select politicians. I did learn their way to walk, I learned when to talk, how to dress, how to sit, stand, and all the rest . Table manners were not taught as they were not needed since slaves endured food and water deprivation when working. Above all, we were taught how to gratify any sexual perversion. Just as Traficant opened the door to Charm School for slav es, he oftentimes was the one to \"test\" their newly learned sexual skills to determine when or if slaves could leave. A typical three-day course at Charm School included the usual factors of, sleep, food, and water deprivation; trauma; high voltage; and programming. Often times experimental or tried and proven CIA manufactured \"designer\" drugs were administered which produced specific brain wave activity to maximize and/or compartmentalize pr ograms. I usually spent the first day hanging in the dungeon. Charm School is housed in an identified stone historical railroad barren's former residence, and th e basement was in fact a wine cellar dungeon. It was dark, damp, and musty and was decorated in classic torture chamber fashion. It was complete with various hanging chains, a "},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"stretching rack, whips, and altars including one specially designed for bestiality sex. As I hung by my wrists, I could hear and smell the animals in the next cells—a black Nubian goat called Satan, a small donkey named Nester, sometimes a small white pony referred to as Trigger, and various dogs, cats, snakes, and others. All Charm School anim als were trained to sexually respond to the smell of urine. When someone, such as Dick Thornburgh who particularly enjoyed this kind of kink , entered my cell and urinated on me, I knew I would soon be released from my chains and led to the animal altar for bestiality lessons, pornography, or to pl ease a perverse onlooker. I was hung by my ankles, stretched on a rack, burned, and tortured repeatedly. My feet and hands were chained to a wall for what was termed \"off the wall sex.\" I was taught \"Silence\" in Oz fashion since screaming did not produce results anyway unless they wanted it for pornography. This was implemented with an electronic canine bark collar normall y used to train a dog not to bark. I was repeatedly filmed pornographically , and always taken upstairs to the \"Master's Chambers\" for prostitution to participants, including the real \"Governor\" of Charm School, then Penns ylvania Governor Dick Thomburgh, Congressman Jim Traficant, 2 Lt. Col. Michael Aquino , and others. When Kelly was with me, she endured the same and we were forced to see each other physically tortured as further psychologi cal trauma. This was to ensure I could never remember the who, what, when, or where of our bizarre enslavement. This is what is sometimes re ferred to as cross-programming. In spite of the deliberately created amnesic blocks, I developed a sub- conscious sympathetic understanding for other Charm School slaves that extended outside the walls of this man-made hell. This understanding emanated from the depths of my being, creati ng a compassion for other mind-control victims mat compels me to give voice to their silent pleas for help to this day. I became close friends with one such victim, who must remain anonymous in order to survive to eventually r ecover. This beautiful blonde and I had numerous opportunities to be together throughout the years, as Houston's government sponsored travels routinel y took him into her home state of Pennsylvania while Dick Thomburgh was Governor. My friend and I were photographed toge ther for Larry Flynt's commercial pornography publications, and featured in th e illicit films that contributed to funding CIA covert operations. In addition to this, she and I were able to spend two weeks together when her husband/handl er traveled to Houston's farm in Tennessee for instructions on handling his new \"bride\". I was \"made of honor\" for my friend's \"wedding,\" which was no more a marriage than mine to Houston. As was customary with Project Monarch slaves, her marriage to her handler e quated to marriage to her mind-controi owner, U.S. Senator Arlen Spector. The \"wedding\" I was forced to participate in was for pornography purposes only, and it took place in Arlen Spector's Conneaut Lake house in Pennsylvania. Spector's stone house was located in a wooded, remote setting and was masculine in decor. Side rooms were eith er designated for perverse sex or were furnished with antiquated NASA virtual reality and programming equipment. The musty smell of Spector's playhouse wa s overpowered by the scent of roses, which he symbolically presented to his slave on their \"wedding\" day. My friend's \"wedding\" photos include d Catholic themes, and the crucifix featured was rose cut crystal similar to the one I received from Byrd, "},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Regardless of how this girl was depicted , her innate morality was apparent to me. She and I were referred to as \"minor /mere cats,\" due to the similarity of our victimizations. Like me, she was co ntrolled through manipulation of her religious beliefs and maternal instincts. The delicate rose tattooed on her left wrist signifying her role in government operations did not detract from her high class projection any more than Spector 's immorality could mar her innate goodness. Once Arlen Spector officially became this slave's owner, her Charm School status rose to \"Presidential Model\". In addition to Charm School, 1 endured extensive programming to prepare me for future operations. Houston wa s often booked into Oklahoma fairs, Masonic Lodges, F.O.P. Conventions, and so on, in order that 1 be back in the vicinity of Tinker Air Force Base fo r further programming. My Tinker-Belle conditioning further enhanced my phot ographic memory through direct control for receiving and delivering governme nt messages which amounted to a computerized compartmentalization of my brain, so to speak. I was also trained in covert criminal operatio ns, such as international drug mule transactions for funding the Pentagon's and CIA's Black Ops Budgets, Houston's CIA orchestrated travels in the country music industry led me to a TOP SECRET military/NASA installation at Offit Air Force Base in Nebraska. The \"you can run, but you can't hide\" 3 conditioning was deeply ingrained in my mind there through a technique that was later used on Kell y, as well as on other mind-control slaves, I was taken undergro und to a so-called 'secret' circular room where the walls were covered with numerous screens showing satellite pictures from around the world. These sa tellites are referred to as the \"Eye in the Sky\". An Air Force official explained to me that my every move \"could be monitored via satellite\". On a separate four-screen viewer, he demonstrated what in retrospect was a contrived pre-recorded slide show, with the scenes changing as rapidly as he spoke and typed it into the computer. \"Where will you run?\" he asked me. \"To the Arctic? The Antarctic? Brazil? The mountains? The desert? The prairies? The hills of Afghanistan? The city of Kabul? Devil's Tower (Wyo ming)? Would you try to run to Cuba and live among our enemies? We can find you there. There is truly no place to run and no place to hide. The U.S. Sena te (the picture was of Byrd)? The White House? Or to your own backyard? (My father was depicted waving from his front door, cupping his hands over his mouth saying, \"come back\" just like Aunt Em in The Wizard Of Oz.) \"The moon? We got you covered. You can run, but you can't hide.\" This had been sufficient to convince me in my suggestible stale that my every move could be monitored. During the course of my training/conditioning, I was routinely prostituted to Senator Byrd in Washington, D.C., at the West Virginia State Fair, NASA in Huntsville, Alabama, and at the Opryla nd Hotel in Nashville, Tennessee. One such night when 1 was to be prostituted to Byrd at Opryland Hotel, Lt. Colonel Aquino was scheduled to join him in perversely assaulting me. Much to my horror, Aquino arrived early, in full army dress uniform, backstage at the Grand Ol' Opry. When I saw Aquino talk ing with the Vatican based Project Monarch slave runner, Kris Kristopherson, 4 whom I had known since 1979, my personality programmed for Opry events \"short circuited\". Under circumstances such as this, a multiple without programming would have switched personalities autogenically, whereas I could only switch upon command, I backed away, dazed, right into a soft drink machine. Kristopherson saw me as 1 backed further between the wall and the machine. "},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"\"What are you doing in there, little lady?\" Kristopherson asked. The Colonel wants to see you,\" Aquino had walked over and sarcastically asked, \"What are you doing in those machine wires? That could very well be a shocking experience for you.\" All experiences with Aquino or Krist opherson resulted in high voltage electric shock torture, and apparently neither had any regard for human life. 5 Aquino used the opportunity to reinforce his belief that I \"had no where to run, no where to hide\" from his \"power\"- his stun gun. While I untangled myself from the wires, Kristopherson and Aquino continued their banter at my expense, Kristopherson held up his key ring and jingled it, catching my undivided atten tion as conditioned, while he told Aquino, \"You're gonna need the Keys to the Kingdom to work with this one right here.\" \"Keys to the Kingdom,\" of course, re ferred to my previously instilled (Enter/Inter)\"Inner-dimensional\" Catholic programmed personalities. Since Aquino was my primary mind-control programmer at the time, Kristopherson was informing Aquino of programs prev iously instilled in childhood via the \"Rite to Remain Silent\". By jingling the keys, he was demonstrating his control over me and his momentary edge on Aquino. \"I got 'em,\" Kristopherson was saying as he jingled the keys. \"She's mine unless you wanna play ball. Besides, you have to. The Byrd sent me.\" \"I've been expecting you,\" Aquino said with a smile. Events later that night proved that Aquino had been supplied th e keys to my previously established Jesuit based programming, which he and By rd used and altered to suit their own perversions. Byrd monitored all of my programming \"progress,\" and often tortured me with his whip and pocketknife. He picked up where my mother left off, to destroy any self-esteem I might have inad vertently developed. He said, \"There is no place for you to turn because if you could think to talk no one would ever believe I would have anything to do with the likes of you.\" He often threatened me that I was considered \"disposable\" because, after all, \"The first Presidential Model, Marilyn Monroe, was killed right in front of the public eye and no one knew what happened.\" Byrd's threats and cruelty were unnecessary as I could no longer think to seek help anyway, but he loved to hear himself talk and would often drone on and on and on in his infamous long-winded recitations, while I was photographically recording every word he said. He detailed the inner operational structure of the world domi nation effort, including psychological warfare strategies, and explained how he had and would utilize his \"expert\" knowledge of the Constitution to manipula te it and the so-called U.S. Justice System, and more. His loose lips provided me yet another means of surviving and staying a step ahead of \"the game\" once Kelly and I were rescued from our mind-con trolled existence. Senator Byrd revealed his \"justifications\" for criminal activity to me as well. He used me as a sounding board even th ough he knew 1 was incapable of input or response. He rehearsed in keeping with his motto \"The only way we can fail, is to fail to think of an excuse.\" Byrd \"justified\" mind-control atrocities as a means of thrusting mankind into accelerated evolution, according to th e Neo-Nazi principles to which he adhered. He \"justified\" manipulating mankind's religion to bring about the prophesied biblical \"world peace\" th rough the \"only means available\"—total "},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"mind control in the New World Order \"After all,\" he proclaimed, \"even the Pope and Mormon Prophet know this is the only way to peace and they cooperate fully with The Project.\" Byrd also \"justified\" my victimization by saying, \"You lost your mind anyway, and at least you have destiny and purpose now that it's mine.\" Our country's involvement in drug distribut ion, pornography, and white slavery was justified\" as a means of \"gaining contro l of all illegal activities world wide\" to fund Black Budget covert activity that would \"bring about world peace through world dominance and total control\". He adhered to the belief that \"95% of the (world's) people WANT to be led by the 5%\", and claimed this can be proven because \"the 95% DO NOT WANT TO KN OW what really goes on in gov- ernment\". Byrd believed that in order for this world to survive, mankind must take a \"giant step in evolution through creating a superior race\". To create this \"superior race,\" Byrd believed in the Nazi and KKK principles of \"annihilation of underprivileged races and cultures\" th rough genocide, to alter genetics and breed \"the more gifted-the blondes of this world\". As Byrd's captive audience (literally), I absorbed in formation that the other so-called masterminds behind the New World Order would never have revealed for security reasons. But Byrd regarded me as \"his\" object, a game-piece that he could strategically move through lif e as though he were playing a chess game. He perceived me as totally under his control with no possibility of my ever being rescued, surviving, and recovering my mind and memory. Byrd likely would have talked to a post, and I filled the role as his silent sounding board. My CIA Operative mind-control handler, Alex Houston was often scheduled to perform at the Swiss Villa Amphitheat re in Lampe, Missouri, which is yet another installation where 1 was prog rammed. Swiss Villa was a cover for a CIA Near Death Trauma Center of whic h there are several across the country. It is a remote, high security resort, enclosed with military barbed wire fences, that swings its guarded gate open to the local public for country music concerts. The small Amphitheatre covers the covert activities occurring inside, which includes U.S. Government CIA cocaine and heroin distribution operations and mind-control projects. Swiss Villa, like the Mount Shasta, California compound, was also used as a training and operations camp for the Shadow Government's paramilitary projects referred to by Senator Tnouye (D. HI). I learned that this not-so-secret military buildup, sanctioned by corrupt members of our government, consisted of special forces trained robotic soldiers, numerous black unmarked helicopters, and the highest technological advanc ements in TOP SECRET weaponry and \"Star Wars\" electro magnetic mind-cont rol equipment. These paramilitary compounds were intended for global policing of the New World Order through the Multi-Jurisdictional Police Force. \"A Most Dangerous Game\" was often played at Swiss Villa and involved CIA agents, politicians, and others who woul d attend the resort just for the sport of hunting humans. Kelly and I both were hunted at Swiss Villa. The tortures and rape after being caught were exte nsive and sufficiently traumatized our minds for ensuing programming, as well as for creating memory compartmentalization for the high level operations we witnessed behind the villa's patrolled fences. It was at Sw iss Villa that I was taught \"THE Most Dangerous Game\" was one where a slave trie d to escape and reveal what he or she had learned. If the hunters could not catch and stop the slave, then the "},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"black helicopters patrolling the area woul d. And if all else failed, the \"Eye in the Sky\" would locate him or her, and a torturous death was supposedly imminent. According to my abusers, my deprograminer and primary advocate Mark Phillips and I have embarked on \"THE Most Dangerous Game\" through efforts such as releasing this book and turning a spotlight on the Shadow Government to reveal its members' identities and their crimes against humanity, Mark Phillips and I are determined to beat th em at their own \"game\" by arming the \"95%\" with the truth that perpetrators \"don't want them to know!\" 1 Dick Thomburgh is listed in Houston's CIA me mo book which is now in my (and others') possession. 2 Please note that, while still Sheriff of Youngst own, Ohio, Traficant wis investigated and subsequently indicted for federal racketeering, drug distribution, and Mafia connections. However, he was acquitted through careful CIA jury manipulation and he went on to become the U.S. Representative he is to this date. 3 Once gaining \"eyes to see and ears to hear,\" this \"you can run, but you can't hide\" theme is so widely used it is visible from Hallmark gree ting cards to Interstate overpasses to the lock-in song by the rock group, Police's \"I'll Be Watching You\". 4 A good friend of mine who remains a victim to date was \"married\" to Kristopherson on the night she wed her mind-control handler-much the way I had \"married\" Byrd when I wed Houston. The crucifix used to her Larry Flynt \"wedding night\" porn photos was mirrored rather than crystal. 5 Kristopherson nearly strangled me to death with his penis, which had further sexually excited him, late in the summer of 1987 during another incide nt related to Byrd. "},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8 CIA'S WAR ON DRUGS OPERATION: ELIMINATING COMPETITION I no longer had any mind of my own. I was absolutely void of free will and was now totally robotic. So was Kelly, We wore our Charm School smile at all times, and did exactly what we were told to do. The only characteristic noticeably out of place was Kelly's ag e-inappropriate programmed vocabulary and mannerisms. Outsiders attributed this to her traveling within the country music industry. My public image was a programmed personality that always smiled, looked and talked like the proverbial \"air-head\" blonde that kept out- siders away by socializing only with in my controlled environment. This lifestyle appeared quite normal for my role as Houston's much younger \"wife\" in the country music industry. When we were not traveling, I be gan each day at 4:00 A.M. with a minimum of 2 hours aerobic exercise. Af terward, I tended farm animals and did other chores, then cooked Houston a large country breakfast which neither Kelly or I were permitted to share. H ouston would then order me to work to exhaustion on his 100-acre farm while he watched. These chores included hauling, stacking, and feeding out hundr eds of bales of hay to our livestock each year; maintaining miles of electric fencing; cutting acres of grass with a push mower an average of twice weekly; busting concrete with a sledge hammer and mixing and pouring new cement; digg ing by hand and maintaining a two acre vegetable garden for canning; cutting, hauling, and slacking firewood for Houston, his neighbors, and friends; s hoveling pick-up truck loads of creek gravel to fill in enormous potholes in the gravel road leading to 11 rural residences including Jack Greene's; and anything else Houston could think of that would wear me down . Houston's exhaustive, sl ave-driving work orders made my father's seem benevolent in comparison. The \"best\" of days were rough. I ate \"like a bird (Byrd),\" follo wing Byrd's orders of 300 calories per day- with no sugar or caffeine. My metabol ism was low. I was trained to compute calories like a machine, eating more like a rabbit than a \"bird\", I had to count every calorie, from a simple taste of what I had to cook for Houston to semen. Houston ensured thai Kelly and I never got more than two consecutive hours of deep per night. He accomplished this th rough automatic mental \"alarm clocks\" that woke us up at two- hour interval s-Kelly with asthma, and me with panic. These tactics contributed to Kelly's and my total inability to resist mind control. Traveling in the country music indus try was no easier than existing on Houston's farm in Tennessee. It cer tainly lacked the glamour that outsiders usually associate with entertainment indu stries. CIA covert drug operations had permeated the industry. Entertainers were used to buy, sell, and distribute cocaine brought into this country by the U.S. government for the purpose of funding the Pentagon's and CIA's Bl ack Budgets. Nashville's local government, from my perspective, wa s totally corrupted by these criminal covert operations. Cover-up, murder , drugs, and white slavery prevailed. Entertainers usually made n big only wh en they participated in CIA operations and/or were slaves themselv es. I know of numerous entertainers in need of rescue and deprogramming from their mind- controlled existence, because it was"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"discovered that voices could be harmonically tuned through mind control to captivate audiences. To quote my fath er, \"Spies, like singers and actors, are made, not born\". These entertainers have endured much of the same programming as I to permit them to carry out government operations in the course of their travels. Norwegian Caribbean Lines (NCL) cruise ships depart regularly from Miami, Florida and travel throughout the Caribbean and Mexico. NCL provides pleasure cruises to the public complete with \"entertainment\" like that of Alex Houston while carrying out CIA operations. Sue Carper, former director of entertainment procurement for all NCL cruise ships, would ensure that government covert activities staging were properly orchestrated. She rotated entertainers like Houston from ship to ship in order to avoid the scrutiny of clean U.S. Customs and Immigrations inspectors. I routinely took cruises with Houston, muling cocaine and/or hero in out of Haiti, the Bahamas, Mexico, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico to fund covert operations. While I was robotically carrying out transactions as or dered, I was also prostituted to South and Central American drug lords and politicians, as well as filmed pornographically. Houston made sure I was in the right place at the right time and switched me into the proper mode fo r each activity I was forced to carry out. In the early 1980s, this included passing messages to and from Senator Byrd, Baby Doc Duvalier, my Cuban contact, Puerto Rican drug lord Jose Busto, and others. In keeping with NCL's Caribbean opera tions, Byrd adjusted his use of programming themes to include the mi rror-reversal, interdimensional, Air- Water mind-control theme used on me by NASA and the Jesuits. I often saw dolphins playing in the ocean while being transported from port to port via the Cruise ships, but the popular \"whale s and dolphins\" mind-control theme was avoided in favor of a theme more suitabl e to my experience-that of the Sea- Bird-Robert C. (Sea) Byrd. He told me, \"Atlantis 1 has long been the epicenter of alien activity. The path is so well warn that there are holes in the fabric of time and space whereby airplanes and ships, even people, timelessly seemingly disappear, transformed into another dime nsion alien to this world. Likewise, we (aliens) came in, entering through the mirror reflection of the hole in the fabric of space, the deep blue sea. Some of us entered Earth's plane as whales and dolphins. And when we emerged from th e sea, some of us came flying out. Or is that in? At any rate, we are here. Watch for the flying fish when you are out to see/sea. When you see one, you w ill know it is kin to me. A flying fish by any other name is a C. Byrd. A sea bird. Robert C. Byrd.\" The drug business was booming for the CI A, and the only \"War on Drugs\" I witnessed was that launched by the CIA ag ainst its competition. As quickly as 1 brought the NCL suitcases of drugs into the Port of Miami, they were usually transferred to Houston's factory custom-built Holiday Rambler motor home. Concealed compartments were built into the walls for hiding the illegal drugs. If I drove the drug-filled motor home on to Nashville rather than deposit the drugs en route at Warner-Robbins Air Fo rce Base in Macon, Georgia, the bulk was stored in the Hendersonvilie Mormon \"food storage\" Bishop's Warehouse. Some cocaine was delivered to a music distributor in Nashville, Tennessee, where it was carefully packaged in participating entertainers' cassettes, for delivery along their carefully scheduled travel routes. Houston always kept a large amount of the cocaine for his own use and distribution. Oftentimes he ordered that I deliver the drugs to speci fic entertainers at the Grand Ole Opry "},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"and/or at the local shopping mail when we were not traveling. Most often, however, the larger loads of drugs rema ined concealed in the motor home for distribution to CIA drug drops while we traveled the country music industry. These CIA drug drops included an abandoned amusement park near Youngstown, Ohio; Diamond Caverns 2 campground in Park City, Kentucky; and Swiss Villa Amphitheatre in Lampe, Missouri. I was aware that tons of drugs were being handled via our military, but the hundreds of pounds I muled were targeted for exclus ive private distribution. An example of a typical Caribbean drug operation centered around the NCL port of call. Key West, Florida. Houston took Kelly and me to a nearby tennis court under the guise of playing tennis . In reality, I was to meet with CIA Operative Jimmy Buffett, who devoted more time to the proliferation of CIA criminal covert activity than he did to his music career cover. Buffett was playing tennis. Referring to him as though he were to be my tennis instructor, Houston said, \"There's your instructor. As soon as he gathers the balls, he should be over here to meet you.\" Noticing us, Buffett strode over a nd shook hands with Houston. \"Hi, Jimmy/ Houston said as though they were old buddies. \"Hi, Alex and Elemer,\" Buffett responded, sarcastically using Houston's stage name. \"Oh,\" Houston said. Never one to know an insult when he heard it, he continued, \"What do your friends call you?\" \"What does it malter to you?\" Buffett aske d. \"Uncle calls me Jim. I take it you're not the contact,\" Houston pointed to me, \"She is\". \"That's more like it,\" Buffett smiled. \"A little Byrd told me I'd be meeting with a Diamond in the Rough.\" 3 \"I prefer a Diamond in the Buff,\" he said, \"I've got a studio across the street.\" As we walked toward his studio, I was oblivious to the meaning behind his conversation. with Houston and commented , \"I understand you're an instructor. I wish I had brought my racquet.\" \"I'm not that kind of an instructor,\" Buffett explained, \"I'm a point man for Uncle. And you've got an appointment with me. I have some instructions to give you.\" As we entered his studio, he said, \"Welcome to paradise,\" and gestured me in. We went into the small living quarters, which may have appeared even smaller due to the electro nic equipment, acoustic guitars, and furniture that filled the room. A blac k mirrored coffee table, atypical of cocaine users I'd known, was the clearest spot in the room, A gold razor blade, cocaine residue, an ashtray full of marijuana roaches, and a fanned deck of card with the queen of hearts on top lay on the table. Tropical plants further cluttered the room. Standing between a perched, stuffed parrot and a banana tree, Buffett was saying, \"Key West is a key place to be. It's the key to the Caribbean - Cuba, Panama - anyplace that means anything to Uncle these days, I hold the keys. I'm keeper of the keys and I hold a few of yours.\" Looking at his parrot, he continued, \"The bird/Byr d says you respond to pair-o-dice, look deep into the parrot eyes.\" I did as instructed, and Buffett popped out the bird's ruby red eyes, which actually were dice, into his hand. \"Roll your eyes high while I roll my pair-o- dice,\" he ordered as he rolled the dice across the table. Stopping at the deck of cards, he picked up the jack of diamonds. \"I am a jack of all trades,\" he "},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"cryptically continued. \"And I trade in whatever Uncle orders. An order has been placed. You must follow orders an d go to that place. Go to the White House Inn at the pier. Carry your laundry bag (full of cash) with you, and see the man in black. (My Cuban contact almo st always wore a conspicuous black trench coat.) There is a launderman on the dock itself. They do all my laundering for me, and will be expecti ng you. Watch for the sea-man with the duffel bag. When you see the military gr een duffel bag, approach the desk. When he says, \"I need this laundered, but I do not have the time,\" you say, \"Welcome to Paradise. I will make sure it is cleaned and delivered on time.\" Then give him your duffel bag of 'laund ry' and say, \"This has been properly laundered for you\". Take the duffel bag. It will be light as a feather. Return to the Inn and enjoy the buffet.\" Changing modes, Buffett unzipped his shorts as he asked, \"Do you like a buffet? I have a Buffett buffet fo r you now. And if is Paradise!\" I carried out the drug transaction as ordered, the whole ordeal lasting a matter of minutes. A buffet was spread in the courtyard of the White House Inn at 4:00 PM just as Buffett said it would be. But due to the food and water deprivation necessary to maintaining my mind-controlled trance, Houston forbid me from carrying out this last part of Buffett's instructions, Alex Houston Enterprises was another side business that Houston used to cover for his CIA criminal covert activitie s. It included the relabelling of G.E, capacitors for the \"energy savings\" comp anies, Queen Electric and Phase Liner, he shared with his former wife and first CIA mind-controlled slave. She was a Catholic processed Puerto Rican blo nde beauty. These G.E. capacitor banks were sold internationally as energy savi ng devices, when in fact they provided one more means of transporting drugs from the U.S. around the world. It was Houston's G.E. capacitor scam that provided me insight into the elaborate Long Island docks drug network run by U.S. Congressman Gary Ackerman (D. NY). 4 I first met Ackerman in 1981 when Houston was booked into the Woodberry Music Festival with known CIA mind-control victim Loretta Lynn. 5 Lorctta's road manager, Neo- Nazi pedophile Ken Riley, who was also Alex Houston's best friend, often assisted Houston in handling me. Riley in turn handed my Charm School programmed keys, codes, and triggers to Congressman Ackerman, who skillful ly accessed my Alice In Wonderland mirror theme programming. After snorti ng a couple of lines of coke, he stepped into the center of a three way mirror where he positioned me and proceeded to sexually gratify himself in my throat. Ken Riley, and other involved members of Loretta's band, all laughed as Ackerman stumbled around the room while pulling his pants up from around his ankles and complaining that he \"couldn't stand for sex like that\". The term \"Ackerman syndrome\" was coined after that in reference to sex that drained a man of his energy, and circulated among \"those who know\" for years. 1 NCL cruise ships routinely pass through the so -called \"Bermuda Tria ngle,\" and Byrd did not miss this opportunity to tap into old programming base installed by Senator L. Bennet Johnston. 2 When Mark and 1 turned in detailed inform ation on this drug drop to law enforcement, our lives were endangered to the point that a foreign Intelligence officer intervened and subsequently saved our lives through a timely tip-off. "},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"3 \"Diamond in the Rough\" was a term used to describe an MPD/DID slave actively engaged in programming via torture conditioning. 4 Congressman Ackerman's Caribbean cocain e and Asian heroin operations have not hindered his position on the Congressional Post Office and Civil Service Committees, nor the Asian and Pacific Affairs Committee. It is impor tant to note that, as a matter of Congressional record, Ackerman openly opposed compulsory drug tests for all federal employees. 5 Senator Byrd proudly claimed Loretta as hi s mind-controlled slave and told me, \"I literally made Loretta what she is today, and she is maid to or der\". Loretta's son and secondary mind-control handler, Ernest Ray, told me, \"I know what the Byrd did to my mother. I can get away with murder... All I gotta do is call him and I'm free as a bird/Byrd.\" "},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 RONALD REAGAN'S AMERICAN DREAM: A PANDORA'S BOX OF NIGHTMARES My mind-controlled existence became more complicated after Senator Byrd introduced me to then President Ronald Reagan in the fall of 1982 1 at a White House political party. Byrd told me, \"When you meet the Chief, imagine him with his pants down. He's most co mfortable knowing you are imagining him with his pants down. He doesn't want formality.\" Former president Ford had conditioned me to dread the Office of President, and I mechanically went through the motions of meeting Reagan, Reagan admittedly had seen the How To Divide a Personality and How so Create a Sex Slave videos made in Hunt sville, Alabama. He acted very pleased with me as though I had participated in them willingly. Within the first few minutes of meeting Reagan, he was giving me acting tips to utilize in government operations and pornography !! \"When you become your part, your performance increases, which in turn in creases your ability to do your part—for your country. 'Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country'-your part,\" he instructed. Somehow, Reagan's reminder of Ford's and VanderJagt's conditioning to Kennedy's quote seemed more patriotically significant than \"simply\" sexually entertaining politicians by waving a flag in my bottom. After gazing deep into his self-professed \"kaleidoscope eyes,\" each metaphorical phrase he spoke became life and breath to me. Reagan explained to me that the illegal CIA covert activities I was forced to participate in were \"justified\" as they funded covert activities in Afghanistan and Nicaragua. He explained, \"America 's Freedom Train is spanning the globe and sex is but a sidetrack to the ult imate course of freedom. Our job of procuring and transporting arms is the most difficult part of all. But it can and must be done. How can a man with no arms fight? These operations are necessary as American people raise too mu ch hell about violence already, and it is better they're not informed of our supporting wars they cannot understand the significance of.\" I realize now that Reagan twisted reality to fit his personal perceptions rather than to adhere to Byrd's philos ophy of providing \"e xcuses\" for what he deemed \"the order of things\". In typical Reagan fashion, he did not perceive mind control as slavery, but as \"an oppor tunity for those who otherwise would have nothing in life\". He claimed that multigenerational incestuously abused children like myself, or \"previously imp overished baseball players from third world countries and slums, are provided an opportunity to 'be all they can be' through making a 'contra-bution' to societ y, our nation, and the world, by uti- lizing their talents to maximum potential.\" With this altitude, Reagan displayed pride in the sick role he played as Th e Wizard Of Oz, directing Project Monarch slaves like myself. That night. Senator Byrd acted in the capacity of a pimp and prostituted me to Reagan. Referring to me as though I were a machine, Reagan asked Byrd, \"Does she run on chemicals? \" meaning specific CIA drugs. Byrd answered, \"She takes it in spurts\". 1 noticed that Reagan's eyes lit up with perversion and understanding of By rd's statement, which meant that I "},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"\"shared\" whatever drugs were in his sy stem through his urine. Reagan later told me he preferred sex slaves equipped for this task since he, as President, should not have to get up in the night to urinate, \"Well,\" Reagan said, holding up his glass, \"All I've had to fuel her with is alcohol. That's not much of a jolt from a \"whiz of a Wiz(ard).\" Byrd chuckled at Reagan's Oz cryptic joke and removed his gold cocaine vial from the inner pocket of his suit. He and Reagan discretely turned their backs to the party while Byrd \"spoon fed\" Reagan the drug up his nose. Before I left with Reagan, Byrd info rmed me that \"Uncle Ronnie doesn't sleep with his mommy (Nancy),\" and th at he preferred snuggling into his LL Bean, light blue flannel sheets in his nigh tshirt and ridiculous nightcap because \"they're warmer, softer, more comfortable, and don't snore\". Later, in his bedroom, Reagan acce ssed my sexual programming, and I became \"my part\" as a prostitute to \"Uncle Ronnie\". Reagan did not move during sex. After all, that was \"my duty\". And my duty was to please him, whatever it took, and it took more time than anything. Reagan never hurt me (he always made sure someone else did that) and used this as a \"bond\" to the little child (\"Kitten\") personality he al ways accessed for sex. Reagan's most apparent personality kink was his love for bestiality pornography. 2 According to my handlers, his passion for pornography escalated its manufacture and distribution during his Administration. He wholeheartedly approved and encouraged the porn industry for funding covert activity. Many commercial and instructional (p rivate) pornography films I and others participated in, referred to as \"Uncle Ronnie's Bedtime Stories,\" were manufactured solely for his pleasure-oft entimes according to his instruction, using Freedom Train slaves. After my in itial meeting with Reagan, I was used in numerous films that were produce d predominantly at Youngstown Charm School and/or by his \"Chief Pornographer\" 3 Michael Dante, specifically to satisfy his perversions. These included a wide range of cryptic themes, but were mostly bestiality. Reagan often watched the videos while I was pros- tituted to him, requiring me to re-enact the porn however possible. I first met Reagan's Chief Pornographer Michael Dante, AKA Michael Viti, at an elite Nashville hotel where he wa s attending \"charity\" Golf Tournament festivities. Like CIA Operative Charlie Pride's Pro-Am Golf Tournamenl in Albuquerque, New Mexico, this \"charity\" tournament provided a cover for the cocaine and white slavery operations th at dominated the event. Houston and I often attended such \"charity\" events, as did Dante, but it was only after having met Reagan that Dante's and my paths crossed as arranged. Dante took me to his hotel room afte r our initial introduction. He snorted a few lines of coke, looked me over as though 1 were merchandise, and accessed my sex programming. He then arrogantly asked me if I knew who he was. He told me he lived in Beverly Hills, California and made movies. I thought he was referring to his box office flop, Wi nterhawk, until he said, \"Uncle Ronnie sent me. He wants me to make movi es with you as your 'contra-bution.' We're gonna have a good time, then he's gonna have a good time, and everybody's happy. You'll like that , won't you Baby? Get dressed. We're going back downstairs and make arrangements.\" Dante telephoned me often, prof essing \"our love\" through command reinforcements and making arrangements to meet me in specific places for producing Uncle Ronnie's Bedtime Stories and commercial porn. These locations included, among others, Tenn essee, Florida, the Caribbean, and "},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"California. He often talked of owning me in the future, painting a picture of what life would be like living with him. His attitude toward women was atypical of slave owners and handlers, and he often quoted scripture to justify his dominance. \"No arguments,\" \"speak only when spoken to,\" \"take a good beating now and then just to keep you in line,\" \"see to all my comforts and housework,\" and \"be on call 24 hours a day when I need a good whore\". He gave me a slave bracelet—a trademark of h i s porn—and said, \"A woman needs a chain. It's a public reminder of total co mmitment and devotion. A reminder of the chain-of-command. A woman is tied to her man. No man should be tied to a woman.\" Dante's Connecticut Italian roots are in the Mafia, and it was a well- established fact that organized crime and government had a close working relationship where criminal covert activities were concerned, I met many of Dante's associates, and we already sh ared a few common contacts who were conduits between the Mafia and CIA. These included Congressman Guy VanderJagt, former President Gerald Ford, then Governor of Pennsylvania Dick Thornburgh, Congressman Jim Trafican t, Congressman Gary Ackerman, and Ronald Reagan. Dame related to me, \"When Reagan wa s Governor (of California), we went to Dodger (baseball) games together a nd sat in the Press Box. I got to know him real well and we got along. So, he and Tommy (LaSorda, Dodger manager and their mutual friend) and I would continue partying after the game. I brought him a few girls (slaves) and we did business. Really. Tommy LaSorda brought us together-you'll like him. I'll take you to meet him. We'll go to games together all the time, every chance we get. You'll love that, won't you, Baby? You like a Press Box, Baby? Dick says you do.\" I wasn't surprised that Dick Thornburgh had talked about his previous, perverse sexual activity with me at a baseball game back East any more than I was surprised to learn that Dante knew Thornburgh through th eir mutual political and baseball ties. Dick Thomburgh was Governor of Pennsylvania during my tenure as a Presidential Model mind-controlled slave. He used his influence to bring Houston into Pennsylvania state and county fairs year after year for the purposes of cocaine and pornography distribution, as well as for prostitution of me to him on a regular basis. Thornburgh was a heavy cocaine user, and was deeply involved in CIA covert activities-particu larly Project Monarch. He was a firm believer in mind control, not only for sex training and government operations, but for sports. An avid baseball fan, Thornburgh had much to share with Reagan, Dante and LaSorda, I had been giving Handwriting Analysis lectures on NCL's Norway cruise ship (my cover for covert operation) in 1987, and Thornburgh and his friend Chicago Cubs Baseball Scout Jim Zeri lla were in attendance. Afterward, Zerilla offered me a job with the Base ball Commission analyzing handwriting of their \"million dollar babies\" baseball players before they were signed up. Thomburgh explained that the job may not fit into my schedule. Nevertheless, we met on several occasions during the course of the cruise, always for sex, but business was discussed as well. My programmed mind contained a \"baseball computer\" that was created for Reagan, and used by many including Thornbu rgh. LaSorda, Dante\", and Zerilla. It was packed with the binds of statisti cs in which they we re interested; the codes, keys, triggers and hand signal s of certain mind-controlled baseball players. Zerilla and Thomburgh we re cruising en route to the Dominican "},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Republic to the CIA baseball mind-control farm to scout out new slaves. They talked excitedly about the prospect of winning large sums of money through gambling on rigged games. I had been aw are for years that many pro players, particularly LaSorda's Dodgers, were mi nd-controlled and triggered to win or lose according to their owners' bets and favors. The Dodgers, Reagan's \"favorite American pastime\" ball team continuously won, including the World Series during his Administration. The Mafi a was in on the bet rigging, and information was passed to certain ones through Thornburgh and others as gleaned from my \"baseball computer\" programming. 4 To this day I am not certain who inst igated the plastic surgery to which I was forcibly subjected, but soon after meeting Reagan and Dante I was scheduled for breast implants. Perhap s it was done for pornography. Perhaps it was Reagan's preference. I tend to believe it was a combination of the two and ordered since my breasts were no longer lactating. In the first commercial porn film Reagan had directed Dante to produce in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands my breasts were still tender and sw ollen from silicone implant surgery. My appearance was not the only \"make over\" I endured after meeting Reagan. Aquino and I were called to Washington, D.C. to revise my base core programming to override Senator Byrd's control for security reasons. Since Reagan had been shot, he took extra precautions to ensure his safety which included directing Aquino as to how he wanted rne programmed. Much to Aquino's dismay and embarrassment, Reag an admired the occult role that this Army Lt. Colonel played for mind-control traumatization purposes, as it fit in with the public promotion of religion R eagan had launched. Reagan claimed to believe that the masses were easiest to manipulate through their religion, as were mind-controlled slaves like myself. While Reagan had Aquino in D.C., he demanded that he wear his black ritual robes to a White House party to re inforce the controlling superstitions of a few South/Central American diplomats. Aq uino appeared foolish in the eyes of his peers. They knew Aquino's image was only a guise for Psychological Warfare, but his appearance at the White House in costume made Aquino look like he believed his own facade. Aquino got even with Reagan. Minutes before I was prostituted to Reagan that evening, Aquino ordered me into a closed side room where he very quickly had intercourse with me. When he finished ejaculating, he slapped me on the behind and disrespectfully said, \"Take that to the Chief. Earlier that day, Reagan instructed Aquino how to program me in keeping with \"spin\" programming depicted in the \"How to\" videos. \"Program it,\" Reagan said, referring to me as though I were an object, \"under number one. I like the number one. It's the first, the best, and it promotes confidence—like 'I've won',\" I observed Aquino giving him the intellectually disgusted look he reserved for anyone with the fortitude to make a suggestion to him, but tempered his reaction by giving some thought to the request. Since the \"How to\" videos showed the 6th revolution to \"ignite the heat of hell\" for sex, no one would suspect I had sex programming under the first revolution. It would take some modification of my initial progra mming, but Aquino was sold on the idea. By programming me according to Reagan's instruction, Aquino would be able to provide added protection for Reagan whereby any program I was under at the time would immediately become replaced by Reagan's number one as quickly as I saw him. This effective safety measure infuriated Byrd the first time he saw me instantaneously switch out of hi s control in Reagan's presence. "},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Additionally, Reagan discussed how Aquino could use me on various military and government installations to provide \"Hands-On Mind-Control Demonstrations\" of the \"latest advancements in training\" by displaying the diversity of my \"Presidential Model\" programming. Reagan said the Hands On Demonstrations could \"educate our boys in the military to the wonders of the mind-control phenomena.\" \"Hands On\" meant my sex programming would be used to \"peak their interests and lock (bond) them in.\" After all, \"entertaining the troops is a long time American tr adition.\" Aquino did the programming, and Reagan began making arrangements for the demonstrations—which brought me back around to Dick Cheney. Cheney w ould be acting in the capacity of my \"Commander\" for the Hands-On Mind-Control Demonstrations and other covert operations from then on. 1 Since I had no concept of time under mind control, the '80s se emed like one long day to me, whereby discerning exact dates is extremel y difficult. Furthermore, I was programmed to believe that every encounter with certain indivi duals was \"the first time\". I do know that I had been conditioned and programme d in preparation for Reagan since 1978 ai NASA's Cape Canavaral in Titusville, Florida. 2 Reagan preferred illicit pornog raphy videos such as bes tiality, while his favorite pornographic magazine was Larry Flynt's Hustler. 3 Although Hollywood's Dante rivaled Larry Fl ynt for the title of \"Chief Pornographer\" producing video versions of Hustler's stills, Flynt was unequivocally the official White House Pornographer. Dante's covert filming of politi cal perversion for blackmail purposes failed to gain him the international notoriety Flynt maintained through his New World Order collogues such as Presidents Reagan, Bush, and Ford ; CIA Director Bill Casey; U.N. Amhossador Madeleine Albright; Senators Byrd and Specter; Congressmen Trafficant and VanderJagt; Governors Thornburgh, Blanchard and Alexander; and various World Leaders such as Prime Minister of Canada Mulroney, President of Mexico de la Madrid, and Saudi Arabian King Fahd...to name a few... 4 Having been out of circulation since my resc ue did not preclude my ability to \"predict\" winners according to political favors: from Geor ge Bush, Jr'S Texas Rangers to the Toronto Blue Jays' victory during the Canadian political heal of NAFTA."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10 \"COMMANDER\" DICK CHENEY & REAGAN'S \"HANDS ON MIND-CONTROL DEMONSTRATIONS\" Please note: In order to maintain the integrity of documenting my ex- periences using precise and photographic detail, I have recorded events and quotes as they occurred in reality. Please excuse any offensive and foul language, but this is the way Cheney presented himself, 1 was attending another White House cock tail party where, as usual, I was taken aside for a meeting and escorted to a large office. There, Reagan and Cheney were having their \"before cocktail party\" cognacs, and Reagan's cheeks were already flushed. He was in a hur ry and quickly explained the purpose of the meeting, \"You're the kind of girl who could hold a man in line. (He was cryptically referring to the lines of military personne l I was forced to have sex with.) That's why I've selected you to tour a few Air Force Bases with the Colonel (Aquino) and demonstrate for our boys in the service what a Presidential Model is trained for, a kind of 'hands on' demonstration. But you'll have to audition for the role.\" Reagan drained his gla ss and gestured toward Cheney as he strode for the door, adding, \"Do what he says. He's your commander.\" It had been eight years since I had been hunted and brutalized by Cheney in Wyoming, and apparently he wanted to see how my programming had progressed before agreeing to use me in Reagan's \"Hands-On Mind-Control Demonstrations\". He grabbed me roughly by the hair and slung me onto a black leather chair, tipping my head backwards over the high studded arm. \"Audition here,\" he snarle d. Since I last saw him, 1 had undergone Wizard Of Oz Tin Man programming, which he accessed to accommodate his large, thick penis. He placed his hands on my jaw while he said, \"Soon we'll have you purring like a wetl oiled machine. All of your moving parts are pivotal and gliding with ease. Melt into my hands. I ' l l hold your jaw to keep it from slipping while you slip through a window in lime.\" He then jerked my jaw out of joint, and roughly gratified himself in my throat. 1 As he lit his cigarette, I slowly regained focus enough to realize I was in pain. The back of my head hurt from be ing thrust into the studs on the chair, and I slowly lifted my head. My owner, Senator Byrd, had just walked in and realized Cheney had already completed the \"audition\". Referring to compartmentalizing my memory via stun gun high voltage, Byrd asked, \"Did you fry her?\" Cheney, 'cocksure' of himself as alwa ys, answered. \"She can't have fucked all of Washington\" (indicating that no one would believe me anyway, even if I did reach this point and talk). Cheney put out his cigarette and said as he went out the door, \"She'll work. Te ll Ronnie she'll work.\" When Byrd saw that my lips were bleeding, he called Cheney a \"son of a bitch\" under his breath, as this dama ge would prevent my fulfilling other assignments that were planned for me. Byrd touched his finger to my swollen lips and tasted the blood (and Cheney) several times. Then he slapped me hard across the face, which re-aligned my jaw but caused more blood to flow down my chin. He took a box of tissues from the desk and threw it at me, the corner "},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"hitting me in the forehead. \"Wipe yourself up. You're just getting started. I'll see to it you get what you've got coming to you.\" Fortunately for me, Byrd had cause to return to the formal cocktail party and did not have time to brutalize me further. My face was battered, mouth torn, and my throat felt torn and stre tched. I had difficulty swallowing for some time, and could not speak. I certainly was in no condition to return to the cocktail party, and was es corted out by agents/guards. Before I could leave Washington, By rd made good on his threat and arranged for me to meet with Cheney in a blue bedroom in a part of the White House so remote that \"no one could h ear my screams and moans\". But Cheney implemented Oz theme \"Silence\" condit ioning anyway as he proceeded to brutally sexually assault me. \"Byrd tells me you need a good whip ping. But I'm not certain which instrument you prefer, so I brought them all.\" Cheney had a riding crop, a whip, and a cat-o-nine-tails laid out on the bed. He beat me quick and hard as though he were releasing his tensions rather than savoring my pain like Byrd did. I regained consciousness when Cheney slid a pillow under my neck, steered me by the hair, and bent my head back. Survival instinct kicked in when he positioned himself above my he ad, I hoped to satisfy him before he became deadly brutal again. But he quickly pulled out his liquid cocaine sprayer, sprayed my throat, then pro ceeded to get rough. At one point he yanked my head aside and asked, \"Was that a tooth?\" and grinned. It was imperative that 1 kept my teeth o ff him because, according to Aquino's programming instruction, I was subject to death if a tooth was ever felt by anyone. Cheney knew this was my programming and manipulated me with it often. I resumed \"satisfying him as though my life depended upon it, because, of course, it did.\" This is another Aq uino programming line Cheney knew and used. When he was gratified, he flopped over and slept. I had been instructed to leave immediately because Cheney abso lutely did not want me near him when he slept (some insiders say he is pa ranoid), and I began dressing. I was escorted out. In preparation for ''running bases\" for Reagan's Hands-On Mind-Control Demonstrations, I underwent a great deal of programming by both Aquino and Cheney. Cheney laid the ground rules while Aquino carried out Uie programming derail and performed the demonstration with me on various military and NASA installations. Reagan wanted the demonstrations to include all programming depicted in the \"How to\" films, additional progra mming instilled since the videos were made, delivery of drugs when applicable, and sex according to Aquino's instruction with whomever/however many were present at the lecture. Cheney's personal \"touch\" to the demonstrati ons was to have me programmed to vaginally internally electric prod myself with a high voltage cylindrical cattle prod-truly an example of total mind control. I was routinely escorted arm-in-arm \"O z style\" by two agen ts to Cheney's downstairs office in the Pentagon. Sometimes Byrd took me in. Other times Cheney walked me through the building, particularly if we were going to his \"Bunkhouse\" personal quarters. Cheney 's office was equipped with black leather furniture, a huge messy brown desk, massive book shelves, and an hour glass that he always used in keeping wi th Oz programming, to assure me that my life was on the line under his co mmand. As a programmed MPD, I had no "},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"concept of time. The hour glass was a visible way for me to see \"my time. runing out\" and actually grasp the concept. The first time I reported in, Cheney shuffled through the clutter on his desk, picked up a paper and began reading: \"Number one. I am NOT your friend, and I don't want to see you unless I order you to report in. Number two. Fo llow the Colonel's (Aquino) orders, as it is the chain of command. What he orders you to do, is a command from me, follow it to the letter, as though your life depends upon it, because (he looked up and grinned wickedly) of course, it does. \" His cold eyes bore into mine as he walked around to the front of his desk, \"Any questions?\" I knew he \"was NOT my friend,\" but he already \"saw me\" sexually on other occasions. I was perplexed and hesitate d. Even though I remained silent, Cheney sensed my hesitation and becam e enraged. He got up in my face, poked my breast bone with his finger and roared, \"Don't even THINK to question anything I say! There is no question as to what I do, what I think, or what I say, because 1 am absolutely above questions-especially YOURS!! Your orders are clear. Now get out of here! I have work to do!\" Throughout the next three years, U.S. Army Lt. Colonel Aquino used me in the Hands On Demonstrations on num erous Army, Navy, Air Force, and NASA installations across the U.S. accord ing to Reagan's plan and Cheney's orders. The Top Brass privy to the dem onstrations ranged from three at a time to roughly twenty. In closing, Aquino always \"persuaded\" them to line up while I was forced to perform sexually on command with each one. The larger groups were physically painful, whil e the smaller groups often involved unapproved variance from the routine, such as revealing Reagan's bestiality perversions. The wide array of \"switching\" my personalities that Aquino incorporated into the demonstrations, and the vast amount of high voltage and torture to which I was subjected, left me exhausted and physically devastated for days after each one of Reagan's Ha nds-On Mind-Control Demonstrations. 1 My jaw is permanently damaged Fr om Cheney. I have chronic TMJ."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11 \"POPPA\" PHTLIP HABIB My (CIA operative) handler, Alex Houston was scheduled to perform with country music entertainer Loretta Lynn at the Playboy Club in Atlantic City, New Jersey in the spring of 1985, and he admittedly did not want me there for the performance. He explained that after his show, he intended to \"dress up like a carrot as lunch for the Bunnies\" a nd I would only be in his way. But 1 had White House business to attend with a different land of \"rabbit\". Reagan had arranged for me to meet with his personal attache\", Philip Habib (now deceased), who always played the cryptic rote of the Alice In Wonderland White Rabbit to mind-controlled sl aves. Houston had no choice but to take me along once the orders came down. CIA operative Ken Riley, the Neo-Nazi pedophile who functioned in the capacity of Loretta Lynn's road manager and Project Monarch Mind-Control handler, was Alex Houston's closest friend. Riley often made arrangements through Loretta's and Houston's shared talent agent, Reggie Maclaughlin, for all of us to travel together—particularly when it involved government covert operations such as this Playboy Club gi g did. Loretta's singing career and political ties into CIA covert operations have always been synonymous. Riley escorted her in and out of the White House on numerous occasions during the Reagan Administration, By natural attriti on, this put Riley in a secondary role as a \"backup\" handler for me as he ofte n returned from D.C. with orders for and/or concerning me. Houston and Rile y shared much: CIA covert operations, country music interests, Neo-Nazi and U.S. Government mind control, Project Monarch methodologies, slave running 1 , pornography, cocaine, and pedophile activities. Kelly and Riley's young daughter were often filmed pornographically together, and endured the sexual assaults of Houston and Riley 2 together on numerous occasions. This trip to Atlantic City provided me an opportunity to talk with Loretta while her husband, Mooney, Riley and Ho uston met for business. Loretta and I had so much in common that our time to gether had been restricted from the time we met in Minneapolis, Mi nnesota in 1981 and discussed our victimizations. 3 While alone in Loretta's dres sing room at the Playboy Club, we discussed a wide range of topics fr om motherhood to the White House. We talked about Reagan in terms of his role as The Wizard Of Oz, but mostly we recited the general praises we were trai ned to say. We talked about Reagan's \"favorite\" music by Air Supply, which he had supplied to us both via Riley. Air Supply's cryptic NASA/Project Mona rch theme recordings became \"life and breath\" to us both according to Reagan's intention, which locked in our programmed devotion for him. We discu ssed the recent Inauguration party Loretta had attended at the White House. (I was aware she had entertained there as Houston relayed information to Riley pertaining to his recent trip to Panama to meet with Panamanian Dictator and CIA operative Manuel Noriega in order that Riley deliver the information to Reagan during the Inauguration party.) Loretta and I switched personalities sp ontaneously as we inadvertently triggered each other with the shared cryptic language to which we were accustomed. We discussed forbidden subj ects including Noriega and Byrd until "},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"J Riley and Houston caught us and separated us as though we were a couple of naughty kids. I learned more than I wa s supposed to about Loretta while in Atlantic City, but was never permitted a nother opportunity to speak with her so freely. This trip to Atlantic City was mu lti-purpose, which was not unusual for government operations in which I was forced to participate. I had a major cocaine transaction involving Noriega to attend at the airport; a message to deliver to Philip Habib pertaining to the Contras, and another programmed in by Habib in answer to Reagan; country music \"entertainment\" aspects; and prostitution to Habib according to Reagan's instruction. 4 As the sun was setting over Atlantic City, Houston activated the Project Monarch Oz programming that was used for high level covert operations, and had me dress accordingly. I wore r eal and faux diamonds to signify my \"Presidential Model\" business role, r ubies to signify my Oz programmed prostitution personality, and emeralds to signify my Oz programmed drug business. This physically indicated to my contact(s) which mode of operation 1 was under at the rime. Rarely did I wear all three indi cators at once, but they certainly applied in this operation w ith Habib. Houston led me down the waterfront boardwalk toward the hotel casino where I was to meet Habib, walking like the Oz Scarecrow and singing, \"Follow the Yellow Brick Road\", Houston led me up the elaborate escalators of the hotel to a high stakes gambling area where Habib was playing card s. The guard at the door did not let Houston through, and I was sent to Habib's table on my own. When I approached, Habib leaned back in his chair to hear while I quietly recited in Oz cryptic, \"I've come such a long, long way to see you, Uncle Ronnie sent you something.\" \"What would that be?\" he asked loudly as he leered at me and chuckled. I could not respond because 1 was under he avy program. He handed me his room key and pulled me close as he hypnotically whispered, \"Use the key. Put it in the lock. Turn. Open the door, and step through a window in time.\" The other gamblers at Habib's tabl e were getting impatient, and I quickly exited the gambling room. When I arrived in Habib's room, two of his bodyguards accessed my programming. \"Chiefly speaking,\" I began reciting Reagan's message. Arrangements were made for the two guards to pick up a fair sized shipment of cocaine the next morning that was arrivi ng on a small military \"brass\" airplane. Houston and I would then board the plane and fly to D.C. where 1 would complete my part of this operation; When Habib arrived, he ushered me in to the bedroom part of the suite and began disrobing, down to his boxer shorts and gartered socks. Referring to a recent Dante porn film I was used in, he said, \"1 liked your ruffled tennis panties...\" then threw me a pink teddy and ruffled panties resembling the tennis outfit commanding, \"Put it on.\" I complie d. He threw me a stuffed toy cat on the pillows and explained, \"That kitten is going to keep this Kitten (pointing to me) from screaming. We're going to play Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum.\" (S&M games) Habib physically resembled the violent Alice In Wonderland characters, especially in his boxer shorts. The hysterical controlled laughter that rose in my throat would only have in tensified his abuse and was (fortunately) choked back by terror as he begun attach ing heavy rope ties to the four posters of the bed. On command, I crawled onto the bed and lay on my stomach while he tied me so tightly I was stretche d. He shoved the stuffed cat under my "},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"mouth, then entered me roughly from be hind and said, \"Come to Poppa\". The intense pain as he brutally sodomized me was outweighed by a high voltage stun gun as he jolted me repeatedly to create the perverse jerking movements and rectal muscle constrictions he desired. I soon passed out from the blinding high voltage of his stun gun. It was ne arly 3:00 AM when I stumbled out the door with the stuffed cat in my hands, nauseated, disoriented, and in extreme pain. The cool, ocean breeze helped revive me as Houston marched me back to the Playboy Club. Houston knew I had been programmed with a message for Reagan that I would deliver the next morning in D.C. As usual, he began to access it immediately. His quick timing somehow permitted him to penetrate the electricity and programmed codes (designe d to keep the information repressed) and accessed the information. Houston kept a written record of any messages he was able to access (along with photos and ledgers) for his personal profit and future blackmailing purposes, should he need to protect himself. In this case, I surmise from Houston's Panama activities, conversations I overheard between him and Riley, and my recollection of the messages he accessed, that his purpose in extracting this information wa s for his personal profit in backdoor dealings with Noriega. I understood it was these kinds of dealings that eventually contributed to Noriega's downfall with the CIA. Morning arrived before I was allowed to sleep, and I felt exhausted and \"spacey\" as I waited by the curb for Ha bib's bodyguards to pick Houston and me up and take us to the airport, A small military airplane was parked in a restricted fenced in area as we arri ved at the airport. The two bodyguards conducted their business and quickly loaded the trunk with the bundles of cocaine as planned. Houston and I boarded the airplane and flew to Washington, D.C. where I delivered Habib's message to Reagan. The bank transaction numbers later checked out to be a Cayman Island account number. Philip Habib was directly involved in various DIA/CIA Operations I was forced to participate in throughout the Reagan/Bush Administrations, Although Dick Cheney maintained his role as my Commander for these Operations, Habib directed my actions where Intern ational \"Diplomatic Relations\" were concerned, Cheney orchestrated events from behind his desk, whereas Habib was active in the field as Reagan's attache'. The following Operations, documented in their entirety from my experience perspective only, most likely involve othe r aspects to which I am not privy. In typical DIA/CIA manner, scam \"need to kn ow' information resulted in the \"left hand not knowing what the right hand was doing.\" Nevertheless, the overall criminal purpose of Operation Carr ier Pigeon and Operation Shell Game, documented herein, does not change. 1 Riley, over time, owned several slaves. 2 Riley, like my father, Wayne Cox, and other, remains apparently immune from prosecution for his crimes against children and humanity, as it is considered a matter of \"'National Security\" under the 1984 Reagan Amendment to the National Security Act. 3 I still have the handwritten note from Loretta that prompted ou t forbidden conversation and I hope that someday Loretta will gain the piece/peace-of-mind that comes with rehabilitation. 4 In the course of deprogramming, I found retrieva l of this information much quicker than it would have been had Houston not accessed it prev iously, against governme nt policy, and for his own personal gain. "},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12 O PERATION CARRIER PIGEON The term \"Pigeon\" is one with which I have been familiar since the early 1980s when I first began delivering me ssages between my \"owner\" Senator Byrd and Puerto Rican drug lord and CIA operative, Jose Busto. Houston had simply explained to me then, as we fed the flock of pigeons roosting at the Old San Juan Cathedral, that Pigeons were used as messengers. The DIA's U.S. Army Lt. Colonel Michael Aquino often activated my Pigeon programming during the Hands-On Mind-Control Demonstrations. Dick Cheney further defined the term \"Pigeon\" when I learned of Operation Carrier Pigeon in the mid '80s. He sa id, \"You have been selected from the flock (of programmed slaves) for the Carrier Pigeon Operation for the purpose of carrying messages from point A to po int B as ordered. Pigeons, once they fly the coop, find no freedom in flight, but carry out their task of delivering their message from point A to point B by the shortest possible route—a direct route. I will direct your route and you will deliver messages as ordered.\" But no one defined my role as a Pige on more eloquently that President Reagan during the course of Operation Carrier Pigeon. The cryptic \"pigeon language\" utilized by all participants in the operation was intermixed with The Wizard Of Oz, Alice In Wonderland, and \"Genie in the Bottle\" cryptic programming themes. While Pigeon meant messenger, \"Carrier Pigeon\" referred to the U.S. Air Force aircraft that actually transported the arms and drugs. \"Pigeon Droppings\" in cluded the sometimes multi-national dispersal of the arms and drugs after they reached their destination. \"Pigeon Holing\" meant covering up the criminal activity. These definitions, as I understood them then and understand them now, may well include deeper, more diverse meanings than I have perceived. Habib's favorite programming theme was Alice In Wonderland, Through The Looking Glass due to its internationa l recognition and rela tion to the ultra- effective NASA mirror, time, and infi nity space programs for instantly dissociating programmed participants. He habitually spoke in Alice In Wonderland cryptic language, and even used it for sex as was evidenced by his Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum brutal games of perversion. Due to Habib's orchestration of Operation Carrier Pigeon, this CIA covert operation was littered with Wonderland mirror th emes from beginning to end. My CIA handler, Alex Houston had just returned from a brief solo trip \"to Florida\" with an elaborately wrapped box. \"it's from a friend of yours,\" he told me as he handed me the box. \"Let's go into the bedroom so you can unwrap it and see it through the \"Lo oking Class'.\" Cryptically triggered, I mechanically walked to the bedroom as ordered. I removed the silver metallic bo w and wrappings from the box and Found an expensive, elegant dress made of an unusual shimmery silver fabric. A sheet of plain white stationary written in Philip Ha bib's recognizable shaded blue script lay on top of the dress. It read: The heat you radiated when we last met melted my mirror. I had it made into a dress just for you, cut to accentuate your figure "},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"so that when you melt into it, You lose yourself into the pool of liquid mirror. Step into the Looking Glass Sink deep within its pool and straddle dimensions in time. I'll see you there... along with my friends. It was signed: \"Passionately, Phil Habib,\" with his name written upside down under a line as though it were a mirror reflection. Houston knew there would be a note, and ordered \"Let me see your note,\" snatching it from my hands. He gestur ed toward the dress. \"Go ahead and try it on while I read this note. Now let's see, what does it say? 'Come to Poppa'?\" I took the dress from the box. It did not feel like anything I'd ever felt before. It was cold like satin, but thin lik e silk. I started crying quietly, afraid that Habib would somehow show up if I had it on. \"Put it on and I ' l l zip you in,\" Housto n said as he took another note from his wallet and read it as I undressed: There's a pair of magic shoes to wear with your dress, Something in-lightening, to transport you faster than the ol' ruby slippers (Oz) The shoes, like the dress, are made just for you, and when you wear them you'll be fit for a King, I'll send them for you at the appropriate lime. Houston tucked the note back in his wallet, \"See. You're not going anywhere now. You'll meet him at the White House when you have shoes to wear with it. Just slip it on.\" I did. Houston accessed Habib's W onderland brutal sex programming for his own gratification. Afterwards I hung the dress in Kelly's closet with my other trigger-significant clothes; out of sight, out of mind. Until the shoes arrived... Habib \"sent the shoes for me\" soon afte rward. They were shiny black with what appeared to be silver lightening bolts down the high heels and sides. In place of dinner thai night, Houston gave me a \"Wonderland Wafer\" (MDHMA- XTC CIA designer drug \"Ecstasy\"). The wafer, like all those supplied by Habib, bore his trademark that read \"Eat me\". I began to prepare for the night out as instructed. Houston zipped me into the dress, and turned me to face the mirror. As I slipped into the shoes, Houston took another note from Habib out of his pocket and read: Something in-lightening to tranceport you faster than the ol' ruby slippers. Click your heels together (I ob eyed) and be there in a snap. Electrifying-with the rumble of thunder. Boiling through time So you won't be late for a very important date. Houston hit me with his stun gun and I passed out. He then drove me to the Nashville airport where I boarded a small plane to Washington, D.C. I found myself at the White House with Byrd, attending another small cocktail party of about 20-30 people. After we spoke with Reagan, Byrd "},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"pointed me in the direction of Philip Habi b and sent me over to him. My eyes were locked on Habib's as he hypnotically said: Melt into your melted mirror for an electrifying ride. Look deep into the black of my melting mirror eyes, See you reflecting me, reflecting you, reflecting me--you-me--you-me until we me lt together and sink deep into the other side. Habib took me to a quieter spot in an adjoining room and held up another wonderland Wafer as he said in Alic e In Wonderland cryptic, \"Welcome to Wonderland, Kitten. This is a very import ant date. I haven't time to explain.? He gave me the wafer and continued, \"Eat it, and I'll take you through the door.\" Habib took me by the hand and led me to the doorway of another room. It was a dining room of sorts where an info rmal array of guests was gathered. As soon as Habib appeared in the doorw ay, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia quickly excused himself from the table and approached. He was wearing a multicolored robe and headwear with a black-brown rope band. I was instantly repulsed by his \"wicked\" lecherous gaze, I stepped ba ck into the other room in fear. Habib introduced him. \"This is one of 'my friends' I mentioned in my letter.\" I robotically responded, \"It's a pleasur e to meet you\" and extended my hand as taught in Charm School. Fahd bent ov er to kiss my hand. As he did, his evil black eyes bore into mine as he softly said, \"Your beauty warms my embers. See them glowing deep within the darkness of my eyes-igniting into flame-black flame.\" He laugh ed wickedly at the effect of his use of NASA hypnotic conditioning, Habib slapped him on the shoulder as though they knew each other well and there were no formalities between them and asked, \"Am I right? Is that fit for a King?\"' The three of us went into another room that appeared to be a guest bedroom that Habib was occupying. He closed the door and told me, \"Diplomatic relations are very important. You know the old saying 'when in Rome do as Romans do'. Well, he's a King. Ge t on your knees. His wish is your command. Satisfy his deepest wishes. It's your turn for a magic carpet ride, so turn your Genie free.\" Fahd was sitting in a chair by a coffee table. As I knelt on the carpel in front off him, his piercing black eyes seem ed to stab into my brain like swords. I could not turn away. He stroked my neck with his index finger, activating oral sex programming. \"I have heard a bout you and am in-tent on having you.\" Somehow he found the slit in his robes an d parted it as he continued, \"Come into my tent- A feast has been spread fo r you.\" He spread his legs and exposed his penis—one of the nastiest I had ever seen—like a black nightcrawler worm that smelled and tasted strongly of spice. Habib watched as I carried out my orders, much to the pleasure of Fahd, Then Habib went to the chest of drawers and began pulling out his electric prod and bondage equipment as he explaine d. \"Now let me introduce you to my other 'friend'. I need to bottle up a me ssage with your Genie and send it out to sea. You know what to do. Begin undressing now.\" "},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"I did as I was told and lay on my stomach on the bed while Habib sodomized me. He used his electric pr od equipment and programmed me with a message to deliver to General Manuel Noriega while on an upcoming NCL cruise. I was at sea on board an NCL cruise ship bound for their private island in the Bahamas, Stirrup Cay, which was to be my rendezvous point with Noriega, \"Bottled up\" in my mind through the rece nt 'Genie in the Bottle' programming, was a cryptic message from King Fahd to Noriega. It was a moonless night whereby the Caribbean waters appeared as black as the night. I could not distinguish the sky from the sea in accordance with NASA hypnotic conditioning. T gazed, totally entranced, from the rear of the cruise ship. Houston used the opportunity to hypnotically enhance Habib's previous pro- gramming, while traumatizing me with the threat of being thrown overboard. The thought of \"treacling water in the i nky blackness while the lights of the ship fade further-and further--away-until all is black and I sink-to the depths of the sea\" did not seem so horrible in tight of the fact that I was to be the bearer of bad news to Noriega in the morning. Upon arrival to NCL's Stirrup Cay, H ouston and I began our usual walking trek to the farthest end of the island where the CIA operations radio station and equipment were located. In a hidden cove on the island's back side was a smaller island of sufficient size to con ceal Noriega's personal yacht, anchored behind it. As Houston and I made our way along the cove's beach, we came upon an old wooden boat half buried in the sand and a man sitting beside it. Because I was in a different personality , I did not recognize the man as my contact who ran the Stirrup Cay control lower for drug trafficking and covert activity. 1 asked him how he got there. He began his charade, which, due to the depths of my trance, I believed in its literal text, while Houston heard quite a different story: \"I shipwrecked.\" John (the name I called him) pointed to the boat half buried in the sand, \"That's all that is left of my boat.\" I asked, \"Why haven't you been rescued?\" He cryptically replied, \"I sent a mess age in a bottle and I expect a response real soon. Good thing I had these coc onuts (he was carving one) and all that 'sugar' in the hull to sustain me.\" Houston laughed, immediately realizing that 'sugar' meant cocaine and said, surprised, \"In the hull?\" as he bent dow n to look inside the wreck. I looked, too. There was more white cocaine and (d ark) cocaine paste than I could mule (carry) in one walking haul, even wilh both of my tote bags full. But I could not comprehend reality in the midst of this charade, and therefore commented that he was fortunate that both the \"white and brown sugar\" had made it through. the wreck. Houston said, \"So, they cast you away, huh?\" My contact laughed and sniffed, \"Yeah, cast me away with all that 'sugar'— that's nothing to sniff at.\" He looked up as Houston informed him a speedboat was approaching, 1 looked out across the cove beyond the little island and finally noticed Noriega's yacht. A \"black mirror\" finish speed boat, which matched the upper smoke glass windows of Noriega's yacht, was approaching. John told me, \"Probably has something to do wilh that message I sent. Help me wave him in.\" I did. He handed me a coconut and, using it as a scramble and excuse for me to join him on Noriega's yacht, persuaded me to board the speed "},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"boat with him. Houston stayed behind to guard the cocaine that had obviously already been delivered from Noriega's yacht. When we pulled up to the rear of th e yacht, I was helped on board by Noriega's armed guards. I noticed there did not seem to be any big parties going on as was customary, and Noriega seemed unusually abrupt and businesslike. He was not drunk this time. Upon command from John, I delivered Fahd's message: \"1 am under command to deliver a message from King Fahd. The Caribbean is becoming volatile. Trouble in Jamaica, Trouble in Cuba, Even trouble in Panama. Dominican Republic must be launching point for missiles and artillery that are being channele d though Cuba. Concluding arms deal, Carrier Pigeon must be detained until all transactions are cleared. Banco de Panama to receive Contra Aid after all steps leading to me have been swept away by the shifting sands (of Lime), and all pigeon droppings pigeon holed. Our business is concluded. Le t us part on friendly terms,\" My personal perceptions of history as it happened in reality remains somewhat distorted, as I had no access to \"news\" outside of my mind-comrolled environment. In order to keep my memory retrieval free of contamination, I completed the deprogramming process before \"educating\" myself through books And news. I have since learned that what was reported as news was often distorted propaganda, and many events were never reported at all. Therefore, I do not know of the \"troubles in Ja maica and Cuba\" to which King Fahd referred. I was aware, however, that due to outside scrutiny, Houston had recently met with Jamaican officials in Kingston pertaining to ceasing the long standing criminal covert operations. As for Cuba, 1 only knew that I was no longer meeting with my Cuban contact. In Panama, I knew Noriega himself was the object of controversy. The \"arm s deal\" was the final stage of Operation Carrier Pigeon where the planes were to wait in Saudi Arabia until all bank transactions were cleared and the load was ready for disbursement. Saudi Arabian King Fahd would then fund th e Contras via Noriega for Reagan after all evidences had been properly covered up— just as he had done in Afghanistan. After the shipment, there would be no fu rther deals through Noriega involving Fahd, because Noriega could no longer be trusted. Besides, Fahd had increased diplomatic relations with Mexico for c overt operations, and Iran-Contra was just beginning to heat up. Noriega did not seem to be upset by the news of losing Saudi Arabian business, although he was somber and took some time to respond. His translator was working over some complex computer equipment after I delivered the message. I left Noriega's yacht with John and a brief message for Dick Cheney at the Pentagon. Back on Stirrup Cay, Houston was a nxiously waiting to begin transporting the cocaine back to the party area of the island. There, NCL workers were cleaning up from the cruise ship's beach party cookout, which was NCL's excuse to stop the ship. After I muled the first heavy load of cocaine in my tote sacks, Houston approached one worker familiar with the drug operation and informed him we had a heavier load than usual and needed to make another trip. The worker directed us to a huge em pty food container used for transporting cook out supplies from the ship, and gave us the key. We locked the first load in the container, and I took my empty to te sacks, plus another straw bag back. for another haul. With the second load, Houston even carried some cocaine: himself. We had to run quite a distance through the island woods in an attempt "},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"to make it back to the ship's shuttle be fore scheduled departure time. When we arrived, the beach was nearly deserted, as all the passengers had been taken back to the ship. All that remained wa s the food container and the NCL worker who was hurrying us onto the shuttle and on board the ship, which was waiting for us. When the cruise ship docked at the Port of Miami, Puerto Rican drug lord and CIA operative Jose Busto was acting as a U.S. Immigrations officer (commissioned by the Drug Enforcement Agency through the CIA), which he often did for NCL. Busto helped us clea r ship undetected with the large load of cocaine. The drugs were packed into suitcases, then loaded into Houston's specially made motor home which was pa rked in NCL's guarded, restricted parking lot. Most of the cocaine was dropped off as usual at Warner Robbins Air Force Base in Macon, Georgia, to be distributed to destinations unknown to me. The money generated by the sale of cocaine was supposedly used to fund a major arms shipment into Saudi Ar abia. These weapons were reportedly distributed among several neighboring coun tries. The profits were then relayed into Reagan's Contra Cause. A large quantity of cocaine was reta ined by Houston for his own use and delivery for personal profit through his country music industry contacts. Some of the cocaine would be delivered by me to Saudi Arabian Ambassador, Prince Bandar Bin Sultan, Fahd's own \"Homing Pigeon\". I carried a message from Warner Robbins Air Force Base in addition to the message from Noriega agreeing to Fahd' s terms back to Dick Cheney at the Pentagon. Cheney then prepared me for the final phase of the operation. This was a meeting with Prince Bandar (who Cheney, Houston, and others referred to as Sultan) in Nashville, Tennessee where he often visited corrupt friends. There, I would relay a message of agreement to Fahd's terms between Noriega and the U.S., as well as confirm all Ai r Force flights (Carrier Pigeons) and bank transactions. In turn, Fahd's \"Homing Pigeon\" would relay the messages to Fahd so that the seemingly long running drugs for arms deals would draw to a successful conclusion. Dick Cheney cautioned me, \"Sultan will be in Nashville having dinner with friends at the Stockyard.\" (The Stockyard was a popular country music dinner club known for its CIA criminal covert activity involvement.) Cheney glanced at the list on his desk and continued, \"Among others, those friends would be (Mayor) Fulton 1 and (Sheriff) Thomas. 2 They are considered a threat to the operation. They're not discrete . Thomas in particular is not to be trusted--he's an ass and too crooked. So, Sultan must leave the table before the message is delivered. Any questions? Good.\" I certainly had no questions this time. I did not need him to caution me about Nashville's Mayor Richard Fulton whom Houston had prostituted me to, and Sheriff Fate Thomas. I had known the pair for years, had been cautioned about them before, and had no respect for them at all. Together Thomas and Fulton had indiscreetly perpetuated th e total corruption that had permeated Nashville's $2.8 billion country music industry, which ran the city of Nashville. They ran the city's business from a bar—the Stockyard-while they drank and openly used cocaine. If I had had the capacity to wonder, I would have wondered what a \"Homing Pigeon\" so critical to the conclusion of this international criminal covert operation was doing with such low level sleaze. As it was, I could only sense relief at not having to deal with them, too. "},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Prince Bandar Bin Sultan's reputation for sex and drugs was widely known in Nashville. But much of my information pertaining to his activities came from one of my closest Project Mona rch friends.

When Cheney was through with me, Byrd escorted me to the White House to see Reagan, who also cautioned me ab out the Prince. Reagan was aware of Habib's having activated me sexually with King Fahd, and made it clear that my scheduled rendezvous with Prince Bandar would no t include the usual sex. Reagan joked in Byrd's presence, \"B irds (Byrds) may well be eaten by a Kitten. (Reagan's pet name for me), but not Homing Pigeons. Homing Pigeons taste foul.\" Byrd laughed. Reagan c ontinued, \"Homing Pigeons have one purpose. Passing messages. Throughout history world leaders have passed messages to and from each other by way of pigeons. Messages that have set the course of events that have altered th e course of history. Homing Pigeons are loyal and dedicated to their task, flying over seas, yet never pausing long enough to even quench their thirst-giving no thought to their own needs. When a pigeon is released, he takes a direct co urse to his destination. Dedicated to delivering the very messages on which history was founded. Why, even Noah relied on a pigeon to traverse the seas to bring back a message of hope.

(Omitted due to international ramification.)\" Byrd was visibly inspired by the sp eech. I was literall y saved by the bell from another boring, long winded recitati on that Reagan had just inspired in Byrd when Cheney telephoned me back to his office. It was still morning and Cheney had appeared very busy, hurried, and irritable when I had seen him just a short time earlier. My heart was heav y in expectant anticipation of the physical and sexual brutality Cheney's moods normally incited. Yet I was relieved to escape the torturous \"picture painting\" competition that experience had taught me Byrd and Reagan were ab out to embark on. My heart lightened when my escort left me at Cheney's office and I noticed his foul mood had changed dramatically. \"I understand you ordered me to repo rt in, Sir.\" Cheney looked up from his desk where he was shuffling through pa pers and tying up loose ends before leaving his office. \"Sit down.\" he ordered, \"I just got word that the Genie in the Bottle 'Cast- away' Operation is complete and I inte nd to pop a cork or two of my own in celebration of its successful conclusion. I have time on my hands and want you to join me. The bunkhouse is being prep ared...\" Cheney apparently thought of something, went to the door and told the guy who had escorted me, \"Make sure there's some Wonderland Wafers in the bunkhouse,\" He walked to his desk, picked up the phone and said, \"I'm outta here\" into it and slammed it down. I followed Cheney out the door, and we turned to the right rather than the left outside his office and walked to his personal quarters referred to as the bunkhouse. It was decorated in Cheney's western style in browns and tans, with leather furniture. There was no food (maybe some nuts stashed s o m e where), but plenty of bottles of alcohol. I was swollen and bleeding vaginally, the bottom of my shirt was soaked in blood, and my belly hurt deep inside wh en my escort finally came for me early the next morning. Staying around Ch eney while he slept was as deadly a "},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"mistake as removing his clothes or questioning him-it was forbidden. This time he broke his own rule, and did not even punish me for it when morning arrived. He had spent so many hours dr inking alcohol and using his enormous penis as an assault weapon that he passed out shortly before my escort arrived. As I walked into the hall, I doubled over from pain. My escort turned to Cheney and remarked, \"Christ, Cheney\". Cheney lifted his head and proudly sl urred, \"Now you know why they call it 'Dick'\". Back in Tennessee, my CIA-paid gynecologist, who knew I was under mind control, covered for my abusers as usual and wrote me a prescription for swelling and pain, I was still in pain and ill from my exposure to Dick Cheney and his high voltage torture and brut al sex when Houston drove me to Nashville's Stockyard Nightclub for my rendezvous with Prince Bandar Bin Sultan. A waitress led me to the Saudi Arabian Ambassador's table where he was drinking with Mayor Fulton, Sheriff Thomas, and Metro Police Chief Joe Casey. 3 I approached him and said, \"If you please, Sir (Oz), I am under command to deliver a mess age to you from the Pentagon. There is to be no horse play (sex games). We must get down to business.\" There was laughter from everyone at the table. I continued. \"My message is brief and I only need a moment of your time away from your dinner.\" The Prince's face grew more serious a nd we left the table. He touched the waitress\" arm and she pointed to a door across the hall that ted to an empty room. We stood just inside the room , and I quickly de livered ray Pigeon cryptic message: \"The Carrier Pigeon (Air Force airplane ) will take flight... and will keep its promise (the agreed load) while all transactions (both bank and distribution) are procured through the designated diplomatic channels (Habib.)

Iran-Contra was politically explosive at this time, and U.S. Senator Allen Simpson (R.Wyoming) had a plan to set Panamanian General Ma nuel Noriega up to take the fall for cocaine aspects of the investigation. No riega had become yet another source of embarrassment to the Reagan-Bush Administration. The need to convince him to he discrete about his involvement in U.S. criminal covert activities had reached alarming proportions. Noriega had been an intricate part of arming the Nicaraguan Contras for Reagan, as well as an international hub in the cocaine operations that funded the black budgets for ultra secret projects such as Project Monarch. My CIA operative handler, Alex Houston's shadowy back door drug dealings with Panama further exemplified the kind of \"honor among thieves\" rules that Noriega routinely and openly violated. My role, my \"Contra-bution,\" was but a small part of the over all picture. Nevertheless, Operation Shell Game was one of the more significant and informative covert operations in which J had been forced lo participate. My role began one cold, rainy day wh en Houston dropped me off at the Washington Monument where I was met by two agents, who triggered me to go with them by flashing their IDs. They escorted me 10 the large White House uffice where T had first met Cheney to \"audition\" for the Hands-On Mind- Control Demonstrations some years before . As usual, Cheney and Reagan were drinking, this time to excess for so ear ly in the day. Reagan's cheeks were flushed and his voice slurred as he greete d me, \"Well, hello, Kitten. Dick and I were just discussing the plight of the Contras since this Ollie North thing broke out.\" Cheney's alcoholic foul mood was immediately apparent. He was agitated as usual at Reagan's informal ity in my presence. Apparently I had come in during a serious discussion abou t tran-Contra as Reagan's mood was more somber than I had ever seen it . He took a drink and looked out the window. \"Americans believe in their country-baseball, hot dogs, and Ollie North.\" Cheney snorted a laugh at what seemed to be an ongoing joke between them about \"hot dogs and Ollie North\" . Reagan continued, \"And I believe in the Contra cause and all that we have accomplished. And I ' m damn proud of it! It's not 'Law and Order'. No, it's Orde r and then Law. Order must come first because without it, law would be ineffective. Sometimes we must rise above and beyond the law to establish that orde r (he glanced seriously at Cheney)—or a new (world) order. As President, that is my responsibility. Establish order throug h democracy by spreading democracy throughout the world. With order, there is peace. Right now in Nicaragua the people are crying out for democracy, for peace, and I cannot turn a deaf ear to them. Not even in view of Ollie North's troubles. True American s know he is a hero. That's why we must rise above the law to establish order by fulfilling the wishes, the hopes, the dreams of those brave men fighting for freedom by doing our part in spreading democracy.\" Reagan was gesturing into the air, apparently lost in the poetry of his own ranting. "},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Cheney lost patience and jumped from his chair to sneer at me and poke his finger in my chest while he said, \"Order is all that matters, and you're going to follow mine.\" Reagan turned back to us. \"I'm glad you brought that up, pick. Kitten, you have a role in establishing this orde r With the same patriotic passion that burned in your bosom for the freedom figh ters of Afghanistan, you will carry out your orders for the Contras. Dick will define your role and provide you with all you need and all you need to know from the ol' Wizard's bag in the basement (Oz programming in Cheney's Pentagon office). So, you run along now and do as he commands.\" Senator Allen Simpson was in Cheney's office when we arrived. Cheney flipped over the hour glass to let me k now my life was on the line according to Oz programming. Cheney gestured to Simpson and began, \"Operation Shell Game is Simpson's brain child, so he's master of the game and he's going to teach you the rules. The objective of the ga me is to see 'who's left holding the goods\". Pointing to Simpson, he commanded, \"Listen to 'im\", Simpson stood up and began cryptica lly talking. \"You are going on a 'Princes' Cruise' (Noriega's Yacht). The Baby's Ear Shell is your pass key. I will provide you with yours at the appropria te time.\" He took the \"shell\" out of his wallet. It was approximately 1 1/2 inches long and was translucent pink, shaped and detailed exactly like a baby's car. Simpson noticed the relief cross my face as I realized it was not a real baby's ear. He smiled. \"These are but empty shells of the life they once posse ssed. Like you are-empty and void of life. A shell. In one ear and out the ot her. I have your ear now LISTEN, If they hold the pass key, you listen. When you hold the pass key, you speak. In one ear and out the other-never again to be retrieved,\" He returned the shell to his wallet an d continued, \"Listen. Follow orders. The Colonel (Aquino) will be there and you will follow his orders and provide a demonstration Hands On style for the Gene ral (Noriega). It will be different, yet the same, so follow the Colonel's orders closely.\" Cheney roughly grabbed my hair and pul led my head back, got right in my face and said, \"Or, I'll get her, my pretty, your little girl. Follow orders as though her life depends upon it because it does. Or the next baby's ear will be taken from Kelly. So listen. When you s ee the baby's ear, you will listen,\" He spun my head in the direction of the hourglass as he released my hair. He was sneering and Simpson looked as thou gh he thought Cheney overdid it. I was relieved it would not be my job to \"s oothe Cheney's savage beast\" sexually that day. Cheney look me back to the White R ouse office where we had started. He and Reagan shared another drink. Reagan patted my hair back in place where Cheney had pulled it, which made me feel safe somehow since I could not comprehend that he was behind my orde al with Cheney. Reagan switched my personality to where I no longer regarded him as \"Chief,\" but instead as \"Uncle Ronnie\", He did this by reaching into his Jelly Belly jar and giving me one. Certain colors and flavors triggered certain programmed responses. Uncle Ronnie must have had other \"Kittens\" conditioned to the military green wa- termelon ones because he kept an excess am ount of these in his numerous jars. Cheney said, \"How in the hell you drink cognac and eat those goddamn jelly beans is beyond me. Reagan responded, \"Well, Dick, you don't have to have a Jelly Belly if you don't want to. I was just gi ving one to Kitten, here.\" "},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" \"Damn right I don't have to have a Jelly Belly, but you're going to have a jelly belly if you keep that shit up.\" Cheney finished his drink. Reagan chuckled, \"Now , you know I watch my figure..\" \"Figure this,\" Cheney interrupted. \"What are you going to do with the Contras?\" Cheney slammed down his drink and headed for the door, \"Exactly what I've been doing. \" Reagan turned to me, \"C'mon, Kitten, Let's take a walk, I need my evening constitutional,\" Reagan was in no mood for sex, a nd it was a relief to be away from Cheney, He took me outside for a walk in his \"Secret Garden,\" where he said he goes to \"think and solve the world' s problems\". We walked down a cement path he referred to as a \"Yellow Brick Road\". After sitting quietly on a cement bench for awhile, he said, \"If you follow the Yellow Brick Road, it leads right to the Wizard's lair-the Oval Office, How would you like to see where Uncle Ronnie really solves the world's problems?\" I felt like a little girl with her daddy going to see where he works with no real concept of the experience. The guard at the Oval Office door ensure d I was returned to my escorts when Reagan was through \"sneaking me in\" to his office. I was then taken back to Washington Monument where Houston was waiting in the car as though T had never been gone at all. Operation Shell Game brought me back in touch with former President Herald Ford early one misty fall morning. Ford's continued relationships with my abusers had given me cause to rema in in touch with him throughout the years ; particularly since he and my father were still jointly active in the Michigan organized crime drugs and pornography operation that had launched me into Project Monarch so many years before. Ford was about to embark on a game of golf with my father on the otherwise \"Closed for the Season\" golf co urse next to my father's expensive house in affluent Grand Haven, Michig an. My brother, Mike, was with my father and me as we rendezvoused at the Club House with Ford and the Secret Service personnel assigned to him. Ford told my father he would \"catch up with him and Mike at the third hole\" and to \"leave us to our business\". I was maintained in \"Silence\" until Ford and I were out of range of the Secret Service men, and I recited a message from Reag an instilled prior to the Shell Game, \"If you please, Sir,\" I began in Oz cryp tic, \"I have a message for you from Uncle Ronnie. It's a 'humming telegram ' (oral sex game) to see if you agree that our National Anthem should be changed to America the Beautiful,\" (Reagan was actually serious abou t changing our National Anthem.) Ford responded, \"We may have to see about that later. First, we've got some other 'holes' to attend befo re the sun gets up any higher,\" As he teed up his golf ball I asked, \"Do you still golf a lot now that you're no longer President?\" Re said very seriously, \"I golfed a lot when I was President. But now, I just keep up with events from the gol f course. I've earned the privilege of monitoring the progress of America's Freedom Train at my leisure.\" He turned to face me, \"Do you play golf yet?\" \"Very well, Sir, when permitted.\" (H ouston always ensured he won.) Ford was openly amused by my answer and ha nded me his club. \"Give it your best shot.\" I outshot him the first stroke and his amusement vanished. I gave him back his golf club as ordered. At the end of the second hole, Ford sa id, \"I'd like to have a word with you,\" He took me over to some trees off the fairway and turned to me with his "},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"arms crossed over his bulging chest, raised himself up taller, and bore his shark- like eyes into mine. \"Lend me your ear\", I had the Baby's Ear Shell with me as ordered, took it out of my back pocket and handed it to Ford. He began talking as though I were a machine and he was dictating a message. \"Take this message to Dick Cheney, Pentagon. The Mob has agreed to transfer the $2.3 million (porn profits) to the Bank of Cr edit and Commerce International. Let's pool our money now and we'll be swimming in it. This operation has been an enterprising success. Let's keep it that way. Cease agreement with Panama. All Mexican channels are implemented (cocaine and heroin). Hail to the Chief.\" He took a step away and adde d, \"And you (he poked my chest like Cheney) lake care of my friend, Dick. He re...\" he handed me the Baby's Ear. For meanness he added \"over and out,\" and did the sign of the (satanic) horns at my eyes which deepened my trance signi ficantly since 1 had been conditioned so heavily to this by Byrd. After he hit the golf ball, he asked, \"How's my friend, Allen Simpson, these days?\" \"Very well, Sir.\" I noticed he bristl ed as be missed another shot. His temper was rising. When he wanted to add more to his message, he took out his frustration on me, \"Gimme that fucking shell.\" He wiggled his fingers at me. That wasn't the pass phrase and I did not trigger. He gr ew louder and more agitated, \"Where's that Baby's Ear.\" I still could not re spond. \"Lend me you r goddamn ear!!\" he roared at me. Close enough. \"Yes, Sir,\" I responded meekly as I dropped it in his hand. He proceeded. \"Tell Simpson to take care of my friend Dick Thomburgh. Get back to me on it.\" He returned the ear. We could see my father waiting at the next hole and Ford said he might \"bean him one\" with his next stroke. He swung, but missed my father. When we met up with my father at the third hole. Ford set up his ball first, of course, and waving his club at me said , \"Get out of here before I get teed off,\" My father pointed the way with a thumb over his shoulder and let out a shrill whistle. My brother, Mike, walked me through the bushes and back to my father's house. My sister, Kelli Jo, was waiting tea rfully for my return. She was MPDed and horrified of Ford. She and my little sister, Kimmy, and I had all been forced to sexually gratify Ford just pr ior to a special ordered porn film titled Three Little Kittens whereby his se men was filmed \"anonymously\". I was aware that Ford had initiated both of my sisters the way he had me in Cedar Springs, and they, too, dreaded his brut al and degrading sexuality. I hurried past my sister to make sure my daught er, Kelly, was OK. Cheney's threat to her life was ringing loud in my ear. I did not see the Baby's Ear shell spirt until Kelly and I arrived in Bradenton Beach, Florida. I drove the motor home into Florida with Houston and Kelly along, and dropped Houston o ff at the Tampa airport, since he did not have a role in Operation Shell Game . He \"had business at Boys Town in Omaha, Nebraska\" where the wayward boys were being traumatized and sexually abused in accordance with the Catholic involvement in Project Monarch. Survivor Paul Bonacci of th e infamous Franklin Cover-up case has named Alex Houston as one of his abus ers there in Boys Town. Houston often went to Boys Town or other similar \"vacation resorts\" while I was on covert government business. Kelly and I drov e on to Bradenton, where we checked "},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"into a participating campground on th e bay across from \"MacDill Air Force Base. It, too, was \"Closed for the Season\". The recreation room of the campgr ound was actually a harmonics programming operation, and the offices were filled with elaborate computers consistent with high-level CIA operations. The day Kelly and I met with Senator Simpson, I had been instructed by campground workers to drive to nearby Santa Maria Island where we were to collect unusual shells. Kelly and I were on the \"wild side\" of the island hunting sand dollars because they had \" BIRDS \" in them. As we walked through the shallow water, Kelly scared up a Stingray, which sent us screaming for the shore. Simpson was on the beach laughing, looking out of place in his cagney hat and grey suit with legs rolled up and polished shoes in hand. He seemed familiar with the beach. When we reached the shore, he struck up a conve rsation about shells. It wasn't until he told us about the Baby's Ear Shell and op ened his wallet to retrieve it that I triggered and knew who he was. As he look it out, he also flashed his ID signalling us to go with him. Considering Kelly, he had slipped a shell into the sand for her to find that looked like an eye in a spiral, He used this as a hypnotic induction to control her, comp aring it to Bush's Eye in the- Sky. Simpson showed me the shell in his hand and began, \"You. You alone will take the shuttle boat to your Princes' cr uise. It will leave the dock from your own backyard (Oz) at 7:30 pm. Dress ap propriately (Houston had ensured the proper attire had been packed). You w ill be escorted to the conference room and on into the lop deck. You will see as you approach the ship (Noriega's yacht) the top deck is surrounded in bl ack mirrors. Look deep into the mirrors; that is where you will be. And where I will be when next we meet,\" We walked a little further up the beach to where the motor home was parked and, referring to the Baby's Ear, Simpson said , \"They're very rare indeed. This one is the right ear. You must go to the ot her side of the island, out Long Boat Key, to find its match. The Colonel (A quino) has the baby's left ear and will meet you at the Pier at 4 pm. Stop at the little market on the corner and call. Then it's just down the street a little ways.\" I followed instructions robotically. Kelly and I watched from the pier as four big, armed (with machine guns) emotionless (programmed?) guards scanned the area as Aquino emerged from a car. Kelly said, \"Mom, let's go\". I remembered Cheney's threat and assu red her I would protect her, though I could not comprehend from what. When Aquino approached with two Dobermans on leashes, I told him Simpson had sent me there looking for the left baby's ear. He opened his hand to reveal \"all that was left-the baby' s ear-the dogs had devoured and consumed the rest of the baby.\" It was bloody, ragged, and bluish rather than pink. Whether or not this was an actual ba by's ear, the impact was the same. I put Kelly further behind me away from the dogs. I stood traumatized and entranced, ready for command. Aquino instructed me in full detail on the night's activities, and that I was to le ave Kelly with campground personnel until my return. That evening I was taken lo Noriega's yacht in the bay via a small motorboat. I triggered and tranced further as I approached the familiar \"black mirrored\" yacht according to plan. I was helped onto the back of the yacht by Panamanian \"palace\" guards who kept me there at gunpoint until 1 was cleared and my Baby's Ear pass key accepted. I wa s escorted past the Air Force Base officials, their wives, drug people, and the vast amounts of cocaine laid out for "},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"them. I recognized several of the guests, including Oliver North and Puerto Rican drug lord Jose Busto. I was led up the stairs to the conference room where Aquino, Noriega, and Simpson were waiting. Simpson! I realized I must \"be on the other side of the bl ack mirror\" and I gazed out into the darkness. Simpson spoke softly, \"You're on the other side of the black mirror now (NASA programming), peering though the blackness out to sea. Sea of black. Riding on a sea of black, drifting, dr ifting from the winds. Deep into the blackness. Drifting through the sands of time. Black sands, yielding shells— such as this Baby's Ear.\" He pressed it into my hand signaling it was time for me to speak, I addressed Noriega, \"If you please, Sir, I have a message from the President of the United Stales of America: The successes we have en joyed in our shared endeavors are now history in the making, whose course cannot be altered-regardless of the imminent lifting of the veil by well intentioned do-gooders. As this veil is lifted, it may shed light on you. So you must have your house in order, as does Ollie North, and cease any and all detectab le activity I will do my best to keep you under shield and out of view if you comply with these orders and cease all detectable activity at once.\" Noriega reacted as anticipated, obviou sly insulted by me message. In the ensuing moment of chaos, Aquino hypnot ically waved his hands in front of Noriega and dramatically spread out hi s satanic black cape (worn for impact on Noriega's superstitions) which appeared to fill the room. Noriega all but bowed to him as Aquino's control over him was complete. Aquino's manner was side-show-style ra ther than the usual somber tones used on Military bases for the Hands On demonstrations. \"General, for vour entertainment and in respect and appreciation of your successful enterprising 'Contra-bution', the Chief has sent his Presidential Model to demonstrate the latest technology in mind-control advancements. With the flip of a switch, this Pigeon becomes a Kitten (I began undres sing). Quite a different animal.\" Because of Noriega's superstitious be liefs, the whole idea of switching personalities apparently frightened hi m. I know Noriega believed whole heartedly in mind control, but coul d not grasp the concept of multiple personalities (which I now believe he perceived as demonic possession). Therefore, he did not adhere to the idea of one slave being trained for both business and pleasure. Aquino, whom Noriega already perceived as a \"devil\" working for Reagan, was manipulating hi s beliefs masterfully. The impact of this demonstration and Operation would prove to be Psychological Warfare of the highest order. Aquino ordered me to lie on the bed and invited Noriega to look closer at what the \"Wizard\"-\"his Chief (Reagan) - could create. Noriega stepped closer to see what Aquino was pointing out to him between my breasts. A large, carved baphomet appeared. Aquino had hypnotically regressed me to the time of its making which caused it to see mingly \"suddenly appear\" right before Noriega's eyes. Noriega jumped back, ignorantly terrified of this scientific phenomena. I believe Noriega stayed in the room for the rest of the demon- stration simply because he was frozen in fear. Aquino hit me with a cat-o-nine- tails and I shrieked in pain. Noriega jumped, Aquino hit me with it again, this time activating me to respond sexually as though pain were pleasure-a mind- control concept that Noriega more read ily grasped. Then Aquino pointed out that the baphomet had disappeared. Wh ile Noriega looked, Aquino used Byrd's "},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Hypnotic induction as he cut me \"between the breasts with a knife saying, \"In like a knife sharp and clean, I'll carve ou t what I want.\" My trance had been deepened to the extert that my circulat ory system was slowed. Therefore I did not bleed until Aquino hypnotically changed my trance level. He then told Noriega that the baphomet carving had \"r etreated to the depths of my body and soul, possessing me and inciting the heal of hell.\" He commanded me to show any \"face\", the vaginal mutilation carving of the baphomet face. As I did, Aquino offered Noriega my sex. As predicted, Noriega's eyes bulged in terror and revulsion. While Aquino told him hi s \"rejection of me had killed me,\" I ceased breathing and moving as conditi oned. Noriega was dumfounded as Aquino laughed wickedly and threaten ed, \"Even death will not permit her-or you-escape from the Wizard's power.\" He explained that I was the \"Wizard's own\" and \"under his spell\" and could therefore \"re-energize myself and come back to life.\" He put a vaginal prod in my hand and ordered me to masturbate myself with it, pushing the button to electrically jolt myself internally upon command. Noriega's eyes were enormous . He paled to a sickly grey, his mouth fell open and he ran out the door while Aquino assured him that he had \" NO where to run, no where to hide from Reagan's powers.\" Noriega predictably interpreted the demonstration as a threat from the depths of HELL, which should have been enough to heed Reagan's commands to break the drug trafficking ties immediately. (Apparently this is not the case as is evidenced by Noriega's continued Florida incarceration.) Aquino and Simpson doubled over with laughter as they congratulated themselves on a job well done. Simpson finally ordered me to dress and escorted me to the back of the yacht to ensure the guards put me on the shuttle boat rather than kill me because of Nor- iega's horror. As I approached the dock of the ca mpground, the boat driver told me I would find Kelly asleep in the 'recreation' room. 1 ran to her, and, fearful of Cheney's threat, made sure her ears were still intact. I was immensely relieved to find them still there and to know sh e was \"OK\" (I could not think to wonder what she had endured in my absence.) I illogically felt like a \"good mom\" for \"doing my part right so Kelly could live.\" Never before had I experienced such a sense of danger to us both and my re lief was proportionate . I lovingly held her in my arms the rest of the night. "},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14 CLINTON COKE LINES I met up with Bill Clinton again in 19 82 at a county fair in Berryville, Arkansas. Alex Houston was \"entertaining\" there due to the close proximity of the CIA Near Death Trauma Center (aka slave conditioning and programming camp) and drug distribution point at Swiss Villa in Lampe. Missouri. I had just endured intense physical and psychologi cal trauma and programming, Clinlon was campaigning for Governor and was backstage with Hillary and Chelsea while waiting to make a speech. Clinton stook in the afternoon sun with his arms crossed, talking to Houston about him and \"his people\" (CIA Operatives) being looked into specific areas for the dual purpose of entertaining and carry- ing our specific covert drug operations. From my perspective, those who we re actively laying the groundwork for implementing the New World Order thro ugh mind conditioni ng of the masses made no distinction between Democratic and Republican Parties. Their aspi- rations were international in proporti on, not American. Members were often drawn from, among other elitist groups, the Council on Foreign Relations. Like George Bush, Bill Clinton was an active me mber of the CFR, Bilderbergers, and Tri-Lateral Commission. Based on nu merous conversations I overheard. Clinlon was being groomed and prepared to fill the role of President under the guise of Democrat in the event that the American people became discouraged with Republican leaders. This was furthe r evidenced by the extent of Clinton's New World Order knowledge and professed loyalties. Clinlon understood that I had just been through \"hell\" in Lampe, and took it all in stride as he focused on his sp eech. He not only was well aware of the mfnd-control tortures and criminal covert activities proliferating in Arkansas and the neighboring state of Missouri, but he condoned them! Just as there are no partisan preferences in this world dominance effort, neither are there any strong individual state considerations or boundaries, either. I knew from expe- rience that Clinton's Arkansas criminal covert operations meshed with the Lampe. Missouri center where he rout inely tended business and claimed to \"vacation.\" staying in the compound's resort villas. In 1983, Houston took me to Lamp e for routine trauma and programming while he was scheduled to \"entertain\" at the amphitheatre. Also scheduled to perform were Bill Clinton's and George Bush's friends Lee Greenwood and CIA operative, slave runner, and co untry music singer Tommy Overstreet Greenwood and Overstreet were activ e in both the Lampe, Missouri and Lake/Mount Shasta, California CIA compounds. Clinton was flown in from Berryville, Arkansas by helicopter for th e shows as well as for a business meeting. Before Clinton arrived. Greenwood and Houston were in the backstage dressing rooms snorting fine after fine of cocaine, Houston, always eager to make an extra penny to pinch, attempted to prostitute me to Greenwood, \"She's the real performer,\" Houston said. \"S he performs all kinds of sex acts upon command. For a small price, she's yours.\" Greenwood laughed, and referring to my Huntsville. Alabama NASA programming said, \"I've spent more time in Huntsville than she has, and I "},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"know full well who and what she is-a 'space cadet' programmed for sex. She's a modified version of Marilyn Monroe.\" Tommy Overstreet had waited in and heard what Greenwood said. \"How much time have you spent in Shasta?\" \"Shasta?\" Greenwood looked arroga ntly at Overstreet and smiled knowingly as he said, \"You don't 'spend time' in Sh asta, you maintain the concept if you can. I haven't lost any time there, eith er, if that's your next question. I go there quite a bit Enough really to ove rride Houston's suggestion with ease and take what I want, when I want, and how 1 want it.\" Greenwood began expertly accessing my sex programming and told the others in the room, \"You all can come and go as you please, but I've been made an offer that I am going to use.\" He ordered me to undress and bend over the desk where he roughly sodomized me as he said, \"You're going to think it's daddy all over again\". When Greenwood was through with me, I was ordered out into the amphitheatre concert area. During in termission, I met up with Swiss Villa manager Hal Meadows, Tommy Overstreet, and Governor Clinton in the hall. Clinton was wearing a cap that read \"Diese l Trainer\" which I was told to equate literally as \"these-will-train-her\". Puzzled, 1 looked at his cap and asked, \"Are you a conductor?\" Clinton smiled and said, \"Of electricity\". Overstreet laughed as he continued, \"Actually it means I check cabooses. How's yours?\" I squirmed. Apparently Greenwood had bragged about sodomizing me. They laughed even harder as Clinton said, \"Still running, I'm sure\". Houston stepped out of the dressing room to greet Clinton, \"Hi, bud.\" Houston extended his hand. \"I hear you made Governor.\" \"I hear you deliver a hell of a one liner,\" Clinton replied, cryptically referring to cocaine and NOT Houston's so-called comedy routine. \"I'm always aspiring to achieve new heights.\" \"Well, come on in,\" Houston invited. \"I have enough (cocaine) to put us all into orbit.\" I walked into the dressing room with them as Houston was saying to Clinton, \"I suppose there are no limits for you since you're across the (stale) line.\" \"What line?\" Clinton feigned surprise and ignorance. He looked at Hal Meadows as he continued, \"You mean I've left that state of mine? In the state of mind I ' m in, there are no boundaries anyway.\" He walked over to the table and snorted a line of cocaine. \"I come here to get away from it all. This kind of business is pleasure.\" \"So where's that young wife of yours? \" Houston asked, referring to Hillary. \"She's with friends.\" Clinton sniffed the coke further up his nose. \"She's minding her own business. I'm just here to unwind, see the show, maybe do a little hunting (referring to A Most Dangerous Game). I've got a bird (helicopter) ready to fly me back when I'm through. Hey, speaking of 'Byrd' (he gestured my way) I hear she's moved up to the big house (White House).\" Referring to his friend and mentor Senator Byrd he asked, \"So what's his position now?\" \"The same.\" Houston answered. \"Probably like this...\" Houston p a n t o mimed a lewd sodomy pose while ev eryone laughed. \"He still runs the show.\" Clinton kept his eyes fixed on Hous ton's \"caboose\" and said, \"Why don't you show her (referring to me ) me way out and show me that again?\" If 1 could "},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"have thought at that moment, I would have realized Bill Clinton was/is bisexual. My personal sexual experience with Clinton was limited, but I had witnessed him engaged in homosexual activity during an orgy at Swiss Villa. Immediately following the Swiss Villa incident, Houston was scheduled as usual to perform at the county fair in Benyville, Arkansas. There, Houston and I had been visiting with long time Clin ton Mend and supporter, H.B. Gibson, when we parted company to attend a private meeting at the mansion of Clinton's bisexual friend and supporter Bill Hall, Ha ll had reportedly made his fortune in the pre-fabricated log home business, and the Clintons were slaying in a guest villa patterned after those at Swiss Villa . Hillary had taken toddler Chelsea to the villa while Clinton and his aide/bodyguard attended the meeting. Tommy Overstreet was also in attendance as th is directly coincided with the recent Lampe meeting. We all sat in Hall's sunk en living room on two couches facing each other with a black mirror coffee ta ble between us. Hall had cut numerous lines of cocaine on the table, and everyone present—including Bill Clinton—was inhaling it through $50 bills rolled into straws. The conversation ranged from CIA, drugs, and politics to the Swiss V illa Amphitheatre and country music. At that time, a major effort was underway to move Nashville, Tennessee's country music industry to the Lampe area (it has since literally moved to nearby Branson), in closer proximity to the CIA cocaine operations that leached the industry. Tommy Overstreet was attempting to convince Hall, who was obviously no stranger to the drug (cocaine) business, to join the high level CIA cocaine operation that was funding covert activity . They discussed the possibility of Hall transporting cocaine from Berryville, Arkansas to Nashville, Tennessee to be in on the ground level of what would soon be one of the largest and most prolific CIA cocaine operations—the Branson, Missouri country music industry. By enlisting now, the contacts and cust omers that Hall would procure could \"politically and financially bolster h im for life\". Additionally, Overstreet discussed the viability of using Hall's own company trucks to transport the drug throughout Atlanta, Georgia; Louisville, Kentucky; and Jacksonville, Florida as well as Nashville, Tennessee and Lamp e, Missouri. These key CIA cocaine routes coincided with Hall's established truck routes, according to the insiders present at the meeting. Hall was being offered the \"opportunity of a lifetime\" as his role would also include laundering money through his business to fund the black budget covert operations. Hall appeared nervous and skeptical, and Clinton and Overstreet attempted to ma intain a \"light\" a tmosphere by joking that Hall could change the name of his trucking line to \"CLINTON COKE LINES\". Hall was not convinced and began to raise questions as to the longevity of the operation and how he was going to protect himself. Although Hall was very adept at the cocaine business, he voiced co ncern that he found it easier to trust those who were not with the CIA opera tions lhan he did U.S. government protected participants. Clinton reassured him that it was \"Reagan's operation,\" but Hall was concerned that some fa ction of the government would \"shut it down like a sting operation\" without warning and leave him literally holding the bag, Houston laughed and explained that \"no one was going to cut it (the drug business) off.\" He assured them it was far too lucrative and that there would \"always be a market\" for drugs-a market controlled by those criminals implementing their New World Order. "},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":" Clinton added to what Houston \"s aid, talking in local colloquialisms. \"Bottom line is, we've got control of th e (drug) industry, therefore we've got control of them (suppliers and buyers ). You control the guy underneath ya' and Uncle (Sam) has ya' covered. What have ya' got to lose? No risk. No one's gonna hang ya' out to dry. And what ever spills off the truck as it passes through (he laughed and snorted another line of coke) you get to clean up.\" Hall smiled at his friend, whic h was apparently interpreted as consent. Clinton motioned for his aide to get his ledger. Over street began pulling out his paperwork, and Hall neatly cleared th e table of the remaining coke lines. Clinton gestured to me and told Houston, \"Get her out of here\". Houston didn't move and laughed. \"She's a Presidential Model. She's kept secrets bigger than yours.\"  Clinton responded, \"I don't care. Get her the fuck out of here,\" Hall's wife led me away and locked me in a back bedroom. After an indeterminate period of time, I heard her telephone Hillary at the guest villa. She then drove me up the mountain through the dark to meet with Hillary. Although I had previously met Hillary we had very little to say to each other- particulariy since I was still dazed and tranced from the tortures I had endured at the CIA Near Death Trauma Center in Lampe. Hillary knew I was a mind- controlled slave, and, like Bill Clinton, just took it in stride as a \"normal\" part of life in politics, Hillary was fully clothed and stretched out on the bed sleeping when Hall's wife and I arrived. \"Hillary, I brought you something you'll really enjoy. Kind of an unexpected surprise. Bill ordered her out of the meeting and I look her to my bedroom and made an interesting discovery. She is literally a two- faced (referring to my vaginal mutilation carving) bitch,\" \"Hmm?\" Hillary opened her eyes and sleepily roused herself \"Show me.\" Hall's wife ordered me to take my clothes off while Hillary watched. \"Is she clean?\" Hillary asked, meaning disease free. \"Of course, she's Byrd's,\" she responde d, continuing the conversation as though I were not there, \"Plus, I hear d Houston say something about her being a Presidential Model, whatever the hell that's supposed to mean.\" \"It means she's clean,\" Hillary said matter-of-factly as she stood up. I was not capable of giving thought to su ch things back then, but I am aware in retrospect that all Presidential M odel slaves I knew seemed to have an immunity to social diseases. It was a well known fact in the circles I was sexually passed around in that governmen t level mind-controlled sex slaves were \"clean\" to the degree that none of my a busers took precautions such as wearing condoms. Hall's wife patted the bed and instructed me to display the mutilation. Hillary exclaimed, \"God!\" and immediately began performing oral sex on me. Apparently aroused by the carving in my vagina, 2 Hillary stood up and quickly peeled out of her matronly nylon pantie s and pantyhose. Uninhibited despite a long day in the hot sun, she gasped, \"E at me, oh, god, eat me now\". I had no choice but to comply with her orders, a nd Bill Hall's wife made no move to join me in my distasteful task. Hillary had resumed examining my hideous mu- tilation and performing oral sex on me when Bill Clinton walked in. Hillary lifted her head to ask, \"How'd it go?\" Clinton appeared totally unaffected by what he walked into, tossed his jacket on a chair and said, \"It's official. I ' m exhausted. I ' m going to bed.\" "},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"I put my clothes on as ordered, and Ha ll's wife drove me back down to the mansion where Houston was waiting for me . The meeting apparently had been a success. I heard discussions throughout the remaining years between Houston, his agent Reggie MacLaughlin, and Loretta Lynn's handler, Ken Riley pertaining to Hall's successful branch of the CIA cocaine operation emanating from Arkansas, No discussions were as poignant and revealing as those between Alex Houston and CIA operative country music entertainer Boxcar Willie. Boxcar Willie burst onto the country music scene after an ad campaign of high tech hypnotically persuasive produced television commercials that strategically made him an overnight, se nsation and \"star\". The country music industry's Freedom Train needed a conductor to lead the industry and fans to Branson, Missouri, and Boxcar Willie was placed in the driver's seat. Like the Pied Piper of Hamlin, Boxcar Willie su cceeded in his role of trance-ferring the industry in close proximity to the Lampe CIA cocaine operations. Boxcar Willie was one of the primary ground level contacts that Bill Hall made after Clinton convinced him to cash in on the cocaine benefits of the country music industry transfer. Housto n and Boxcar Willie discussed Hall's lucrative dealings throughout the years in my presence while traveling the country together, billed on the same shows, including performances at the Swiss Villa Amphitheatre, I had much contact with Boxcar Willie personally since my government sponsored cocaine runs often coincided and intermeshed with his. But 1 never knew Boxcar Willie as we ll as my daughter, Kelly, knew him. Kelly has named Boxcar Willie as one of her primary sexual abusers in three different mental institutions, and has voice d frustration at the lack of justice. \"Why am I the one locked up while my abusers remain free?\" she constantly pleads. I assure her I am doing all I can to blow th e whistle on Boxcar Willie for hex, and expose his role in transferri ng the country music industry to close proximity of the Lampe, Missouri CIA cocaine operation as outlined by Bill Clinton. 1 Loyalty to the sovereign of our country is non existe nt under New World Orders. \"President\" Clinton poses no more leadership or loyalty to our country than Ron ald Reagan did since both follow(ed) New World Order direct ives from former U.N.

"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 NO MORE BEATING AROUND THE BUSH It was a sunny, fall day in 1983 when U.S. Congressman Guy VanderJagt met with my CIA operative mind-control ha ndler, Alex Houston, my then 3 1/2 year old daughter, Kelly, and me on the steps of the U.S. Senate in Washington, D.C. Kelly appeared fa miliar with Vanderjagt, although I had never previously remembered seeing her in his company. Even so, I could not think to realize he was, in fact, sexuall y abusing her just as he had me when I was a child. VanderJagt knelt on one kn ee in front of her to talk with her, assuring her that \"today was a special day\" because she would \"see Uncle George (Bush) while mommy sees Uncle Ronnie (Reagan)\". He stood up and took her by the hand, saying in Alice In Wonderland cryptic language, \"Let's go on an Adventure together\" and led her quietly and robotically away. I met up with Kelly again that afternoon at the White House, both of us literally \"on our toes\" and standing at attention in Reagan's office. In retrospect, I wonder at the measures of control inflicted on my 3 1/2-year old child to cause her to perform so robotica lly and behave \"so well\" as she silently stood with the plastic smile and unblinking eyes, in the presence of President Reagan, Vice President Bush, and (lat er Defense Secretary) Dick Cheney. Reagan appeared to gaze at Kelly, with her long blonde hair cascading down the back of her blue pinafore dress, completing her Alice In Wonderland Appearance. Reagan seemed to pose no di rect threat to her sexually as he said, \"She is adorable, a model child\", Reagan then gestured towards Bush and said, \"This is my Vice President George Bush. People don't usually know what the role of the Vice President is because he's always behind the scenes making sure everything that the President wants done happens the way it's supposed to.\" He looked at me and said matter-of-factly, \"I catch the public's attention (he made a gesture in the air that was eye catching) while the Vice President carries out orders.\" Bush's close friend, Dick Cheney, said, \"And gives them\". \"Right,\" Reagan said. \"An order from h i m is like an order from me.\" Bush was wearing canvas boat shoes an d a cardigan sweater as he knelt on one knee in front of Kelly in order to talk to her on her level. Bush used the children's television program Mr. Roge rs' Neighborhood to scramble/confuse young victims' (like Kelly's) memory of contact with him and his sexual abuse. His physical resemblance to TV's Fred Rogers was deliberately exaggerated by his choice of clothes and mannerisms, and is further compounded by his developed vocal impersonation. Using his best Mr. Rogers voice he said, \"Come here, Little One. I want to ask you something. Do you watch Mr, Rogers' Neighborhood?\" \"Yes, Sir,\" Kelly responded. Bush told Kelly, \"Well, I'm kind of like Mr. Rogers when he makes his puppets move and talk—like your daddy (Houston, ventriloquist) does with Elemer (his dummy). Only I ' m like Mr. Rogers because I have lots of puppets- -only mine are people. I even have a King (Fahd) just like Mr. Rogers. 1 I pull the strings (he pantomimed marionette hand movements) and I talk through them. They say my words and we crea te all kinds of exciting Adventures. Right now I'm building a new Neighborhood (the New World Order). The "},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"stage is set, and I have hold of everyo ne's strings. I need you to help me— together we can pull your mother's stri ngs. She's in my Neighborhood. That means you're in my Neighborhood, too.\" It seems obvious to me now that Bush was referring to those actively engaged in implementing the New World Order through chaos and mass mind control (aka media conditioning) as \"The Neighborhood\". Of course I was unable to consider disputing Bush's stat ement, and Kelly was certainly not of a mind to see beyond Bush's twist on her favorite television program. Kelly's big blue eyes grew even wider as she responded, \"I am?\" Bush stood up and took her hand, \"C'mon. Let me show you my Neighborhood,\" He led her out the door. Kelly became violently physically ill af ter her induction into George Bush's \"Neighborhood.\" and from every sexual encounter she had with him thereafter. She ran 104-6 degree temperatures , vomited and endured immobilizing headaches for an average of three days (as is consistent with high voltage trauma). These were the only tell-tale evidences aside from the scarring burns left on her skin. Houston forbade me to call a doctor, and Kelly forbade me to comfort her, pitifully complaining that her head \"hurt too bad to even move\". And she did not move for hours on end. Kelly often complained of severe kidney pain, and her rectum usually bled for a day or two after Bush sexually abused her. My own mind-control victimization rendered me unable to help or protect her. Seeing my child in such ho rrible condition drove my own wedge of insanity in deeper, perpetuating my total inability to affect her needs until our rescue by Mark Phillips in 1988. Kelly's bleeding rectum was but one of many physical indicators of George Bosh's pedophile perversions, I have overheard him speak blatantly of his sexual abuse of her on many occasions. He used this and threats to her life to \"pull my strings\" and control me. Th e psychological ramifications of being raped by a pedophile President arc mind- shattering enough, but reportedly Bush further reinforced his traumas to Kelly's mind with sophisticated NASA electronic and drug mind-control devices. Bush also instilled the \"Who ya gonna call?\" and \"I'll be watching you\" binds on Kelly, further reinforcing her sense of helplessness. The systematic t onures and traumas I endured as a child now seem trite in comparison to th e brutal physical and psychological devastation that George Bush inflicted on my daughter. As soon as the door closed behind Bu sh and Kelly, Dick Cheney reached over to Reagan's desk from his seat a nd flipped over the hourglass. (Oz) \"Her (Kelly's) time is running out. You'd better pay attention and follow orders as though her life depends on it, because fro m now on (heh heh) it always does! If you make one mistake—one—then I'll get her, my pretty.\" Reagan said, \"George is like a director . He makes sure the stage is set to implement the New World Order as I envi sion it. Then he makes sure everyone has a script and knows their pan. He tells them how to speak and when to speak it. How to dress and (patting my he ad) how to wear their hair. He gets everything and everyone in place and hollers, 'Action!'\" Reagan shouted through his hand as though it were a megaphone and rambled on, \"All the world's a stage. I ' m the Wizard. But he is directing the show so you better pay attention and learn your part well from him.\" Cheney interrupted, \"George and I will be working closely on a few projects together, and when you see him, you'll see me. When you're given orders from him, you're given orders from me.\" "},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":" \"She knows the chain of command, Dick,\" Reagan injected, referring to his perception of who was in charge, and in what order. President, Vice President, Habib, Cheney, Byrd, etc. may have b een the chain of command in Reagan's mind, but Cheney's definition was neces sary to my understanding. From my perspective, the chain of command was clearly Bush, Cheney, Habib, Reagan, Aquino and lastly, on a par with my ha ndler, Houston, Byrd, all of which was subjet to change at any given moment. Ch eney just rolled his eyes at Reagan's comment and never slowed down as he continued, \"Right now a stage is being set and you will be directed by the Vice President on just how he wants you to do your part in setting the stage for Me xico's role in the New World Order.\" Reagan jumped in again, \"With the world in order, there will be world peace. By strategically placing an American Patriot dedicated to the cause of spreading democracy in all parts of the world, we can influence the thinking of every nation's leader and paint for them a picture of freedom and American values that they'll never forget. They' ll spread it to the people and the whole planet will be of one mind—one pur pose-one cause. Freedom. You'll be talking with some of these friends and l eaders from time to lime on my behalf.\" Bush slipped back into the meeting, without Kelly. Cheney continued, \"Taking orders from me and your new director-the Vice President. Lesson number one. You know what Miami Vice is . Undercover drug agents taking control of the drug industry. A Vice Pr esident is just that-an undercover drug agent taking control of the drug industry-for the President.\" Bush spoke up. \"Mexico is a problem. They've got lots of drugs, but not the brains nor lhe means to sell it out side their own country. So how can we take control of their (growing) drug indu stry when we can't even get our hands on it? It's your duty as an American citizen to open the routes and initiate freedom from poverty throughout their nati on by offering them cash as a means of enticing their drug industr y right into our grasp by br inging it right up to our doorsteps.\" \"Operation Greenbacks for Wetbacks,\" Cheney said, laughing. Bush laughed with him. Bush regained his composure to conclude, \"Your assignment begins in Miami with NCL (Norwegian Caribbean Li nes) and ends when you return from Mexico with word of success.\" Cheney caught my eye with a hand gest ure that directed my gaze from Bush to the hourglass, which was running out fa st. By then I was deeply tranced and lost touch with my surroundings all to gether while my trance was timelessly deepened for further programming, I left the White House with a message for the Vice President of Mexico, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, from the Vice President of the U.S., and with one very sick child. 1 Mr Roger projects through puppe ts on his show, and one of his key characters from the Land of Make-Believe is King Friday the 13th. "},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 OPERATlON GREENBACKS FOR WETBACKS My CIA mind-control handler, Alex H ouston and I boarded the Norwegian Caribbean Lines ship bound for Cozumel, Mexico, with a large, black, soft side suitcase packed full of cash and a proposal of \"prosperity\" from the U.S. This proposal, programmed in me by Vice Pr esident Bush, was supposedly initial diplomatic groundwork for the Nort h American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). It was my understanding then that the North American Free Trade Agreement was considered a significant step in implementing the New World Order through mind manipulation of the masses. According to Byrd, propaganda disguising the true purpose of NAFTA included the concept of \"free trade\" which the U.S. and Mexican gov ernments had long since shared. \"Free trade\" of child and adult mind-controlled slaves, cocaine, heroin and businesses has been not-so-secretly proliferating for years. My own father joined the \"run for the border\" via U.S. State Departme nt and Mexican subsidized business incentives and opened yet another branch of his U.S. Department of Defense- given-business in Mexico. This was part of the \"free trade\" agreement that I know personally has been operating smoothly from at least 1984. In an effort to maintain the illusion that the agreemen t would not create a negative economic imbalance between Mexico and the U.S. , tourist areas of Mexico were deliberately built up, enhanced and Americanized with U.S. dollars. These funds were provided through CIA covert Black Budget operations of drug and slave trading, as well as directly th rough the Senate Appropriations Committee of which Senator Robert C. Byrd is chairman as of this writing. I certainly do not purport to understa nd international business, nor have I attempted to \"educate\" myself through what 1 know to be propaganda slanted and filtered periodicals. How money interfaces in world markets has been well documented. For example, who supports whom in which financial endeavors is apparently far too complex for even BCCI attorneys and investigators to sort through. My personal perspective on Mexican, U.S., and Saudi Arabian buildup of Mexico's economy is limited to my own experiences. My under- standing is further affected by delibe rate misinformation from the criminal perspectives of those who were in c ontrol of my mind's knowledge base and actions. From time to time, Senator Byrd used me as a robotic sounding board. He told me what he wanted me to hear , and this was structured more toward stroking his own enormous, warped ego than it was to educate me in world finance. Senator Byrd claimed \"the money game is simply a game of control,\" and lives by his adopted Golden Rule of \"He who holds the gold makes the rules,\" He told me in so many words that \"by appropriating funds to all (viable) projects ushering in the free trade agr eement, and allocating lesser amounts to U.S. social systems such as our 'criminal' justice system, I control our country and our place in world markets. All the world is a stage, and I own the theater!...you can bank on it!\" Senator Byrd's twisted reality echoed in my mind when America was bought (stolen) and sold by Presidents Bush and Clinton in the recent passage of NAFTA. \"I would never run for President—Oh, I'd win if I did,\" Byrd "},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"bragged. \"But why should I run for an office that is beneath me? I can make a President look good, or I can make him look bad by strategically appropriating funds.\" Byrd and others I knew boasted that he was one of those (corrupt power brokers) responsible for Bill Clinton's being \"chosen\" and elected to the office of Presidency. And the last minute bids and dealings with those Congressmen holding NAFTA's deciding votes proved \"strategic appropriations\" indeed made Clint on \"look good\" in his NAFTA \"victory\". At the La Celiba Hotel in Cozumel, Houston maintained my food and water depravation for mind-control purposes, even during our dinner meeting in the hotel's restaurant later that evening. Although the restaurant was \"officially\" closed due to the late hour, a mariachi band, one waiter, four stationed armed guards, my Mexican dignitary contact, hi s two assistants, and handler, Houston and I were present. During the meeting, arrangements were made to meet with Mexico's then Vice President Salinas th e next afternoon at a nearby military in- stallation. I would also deliver a message as usual from Senator Byrd at the nearby Consulate's office pertaining to U.S. financial support for creating propaganda to insure the illusion of econo mic equality in Mexican tourist areas. These funds were simply to further the ongoing shared goal of easing into New World Order domination through carefull y contrived smoke and mirror tactics. The next afternoon, Houston escorted me to the high security fenced government installation for my meetin g with Salinas. According to Bush, Salinas was regarded by the Reagan-Bush Administration as superior in power to Miguel de la Madrid who was officia lly President of Mexico at that time. The upcoming Mexican \"election,\" wh ich was no more an election than Reagan's second term, was to place Salinas in the office of President to coincide with Bush's destined Presidency. To in sure that this \"strategically placed American Patriot\" would be voted into position, Reagan informed me that the U.S. would \"guard the integrity\" of \"e lections\" by covertly \"overseeing\" them, among other strategies. Salinas wa s to be President at all costs. Although President de la Madrid was cons idered by Bush to be the stepping stone to the ultimate reign of Salinas/Bu sh's (already established) diplomatic relations, he was regarded with all due respect in a manner conducive to \"no margins for error\". His full cooperation was tantamount to establishing Bush's and Salinas 1 goals via free flowing drug mark ets and Mexico's cooperation in subversively funding and supplying R eagan's Nicaraguan Contras. De la Madrid worked in close association with Salinas so that a smooth transition of power would maintain U.S.-Mexican re lations and efforts already in place. \"A message to Salinas is a message to the President,\" Cheney had ex- plained. Not only would the message be relayed to de Ja Madrid, but for the most part Salinas was the one responsibl e for working with George Bush since they would both come into power during the most critical point in the promotion of NAFTA—passing it by the American people and into law. President Reagan, Mexican President de la Madrid, Vi ce President Bush, and Mexican Vice President Salinas were all \"of one mind—one effort\" toward economic expansion and growth for our southern \"neighbors in the New World Order\" through what I experienced was based on \"free trade\" of drugs, children, and pornography. Vice President Bush told me that this (criminal) activity was regarded as Mexico's \"only means of rapid economic advancement and freedom from poverty since the people were slaves to their own inability to advance in world markets.\" "},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"When I arrived at the military installa tion with the aforementioned suitcase of cash in hand, I was taken to Salinas' \"office\" through a series of electronic gates guarded by officers in white unif orms. Salinas sal at his desk, which was small and functional (i.e., military issu e), set on a highly polished wooden floor in a vast room virtually void of decor an d personal effects. This created an air of military practicality. I set the suitcas e in front of Salinas and began relaying the message I had been programmed to deliver \"I have a message from the Vice President of the United State of America to our neighbors in Mexico. America is willing to share its wealth through a trade agreement with Mexico. We'll trade our cash for control over Mexico's cocaine and heroin production. By contro lling your drug industry, we can open the border between our countries to allow a free flow of cocaine and heroin into the U.S., bought and paid for in American dollars to build Mexico, Eventually this could dissolve the border between our countries altogether as Mexico's economy grows to match ours. If we begin today, this dream could be realized by the turn of the century-sharing the same continent, sharing the same wealth. Why? The drug industry already dictates what the Mexican government can or cannot do. By giving the U.S. control of your drug industry, Mexico regains control over her government. Re-establish ed power backed by U.S. dollars will bring Mexico on an economic par with America. We can begin by spreading the word through the (drug) cartels that th e U.S. is covertly willing to open the borders to free drug trade by making ag ents available to show you the passage and routes through which the drugs are to be delivered. Only U.S. agents can bring Mexican heroin and (South American) cocaine across the border, and likewise they will bring the cash in. Expl ain to those select few who control the drug empires that the cruise line (NCL) agreement is going into mass expansion, tearing down the border betw een our countries enough to allow for as many drugs to come in as Mexico can deal out. When do we begin? Im- mediately. The cash is at hand. (I gestured toward the suitcase which Salinas unzipped to find full of cash.) Deliver whatever amount of brown heroin you have at hand as a means of confirmation to the agreement. Keep the change as a token of the change and good fortune that has befallen Mexico from its neighboring nation.\" As I finished Bush's message, Salinas immediately took a note pad from the desk and scrawled a quick note. He pa ssed it to a guard who was stationed at the door. He stood up, smiled, and leaned over his desk as he extended his hand in a warm handshake. I was escort ed out. Houston found me on the front steps of the installation and together we were escorted through the barbed wire fences and back onto the streets of Cancun, I waited in a small clea ring nearby for an indete rminate length of time, playing with a large iguana. Finally, a taxi cab driver pulled up and honked his horn three times, signaling me to pick up a fist-sized ball of Mexican brown heroin. The heroin was crudely wrapped in brown paper, tied with twine, and measured approximately the size of a ba seball. As quickly as the cab driver left, Houston, who was standing some di stance away with two uniformed men, signaled me to join him. We were then driven to the airport where we boarded a U.S. Air Force aircraft to Washington, D.C. Immediately upon arrival at Andrews Air Force Base just outside of Washington, D.C, I was taken to Senator Byrd who then escorted me to Dick Cheney's Pentagon office for a meeting with Vice President Bush, 1 was ill and vomiting from the high voltage administe red in Mexico to compartmentalize my "},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"memory. I was allowed to use Byrd's magnetic pass key card to unlock the maze of doors that led to the Ladi es' Room. I was still wearing my inappropriate-for-D.C. cruise clothes and carrying the heroin in my tote bag when I met with Bush to confirm Mexi co's agreement to his proposal. Bush took the heroin for himself, obviously pleased with the quality of the product. Cheney laughed and told Bush he need ed to \"confiscate the Contra-band\". Bush replied, \"Over my dead body\" as he laughed at Cheney's Contra joke. \"If you don't share some of it, that c ould be the case,\" Cheney said. \"Pitch it here.\" Bush struck a pitch pose, wound up, made a fake out pitch, and joked in baseball banter, \"It's a 'high fly' ball. You're going to have to steal.\" He tossed the heroin in the air, caught it , and strode for the door, Cheney got out of his chair, pointed to the door, and ordered me \"Out\". Houston and I were flown in to Mont ego Bay, Jamaica and transported to Ocho Rios to board our next NCL cruise ship. "},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 17 ABOUT FACES Soon after Kelly was inducted into George Bush's \"Neighborhood\" through horrific sexual abuse, Bush enforced his controls on me. Our mind-control handler, Alex Houston, had taken Ke lly and me to Washington, D.C. for separately scheduled meetings with Bush. Kelly had already been escorted by agents to her rendezvous with him that morning, during which Lime I had been ordered to one of U.S, Senator Robert C. Byrd's offices located in the nearby FBI Hoover Building. There, Byrd reinforced his holds on me by claiming control of the Justice Department and \"proving\" once again that I had \"no where to run and no where to hide\". My horror reaction was compounded when Byrd looked at his pocket watch and notified me in Alice in Wonderland cryptic language, \"You're late, you're late for a very important date,\" referring to my meeting with Bush. I sprinted from the Hoover Building, encountering Houston who waited just outside. Houston hurried me to the Smithsonian where I waited for my escorts as instructed at the \"Face Changing\" exhibit. This computerized exhibit illustrates how an individual's face can take on a radically different appearance by slightly altering any single feature. The exhibit fascinated me as a programmed MPD since multiples often experience the unnerving phenomena of r outinely not recognizing themselves in a mirror due to switching personalities. A multiple's face often changes slightly with each switch, which \"validates\" the religious communities' perceptions of so-called \"demonic possession\" in occultism. Logic quickly dispels this belief when it is realized that everyone's expr ession changes according to emotion, by skin color and tones, blood pressure, and by tightening or relaxing specific micro muscles. An MPD's face change s are more exaggerated when these natural conditions are combined with the results of sophisticated programming/ \"Charm School\" teaches subc onscious control over these natural phenomena as a ready-made disguise on government sl aves such as myself, as welt as to enhance sex slaves' \"beauty\" to their maximum potential. I was incapable of thinking or logically understanding my fascination with the display, as I stood totally enthralled, waiting for my escorts as ordered. As the escorts approached, I was reli eved to see Kelly with them. Though she was visibly tranced and traumatized, the fact that she was alive was all I was capable of grasping. When she saw the \"Face Changing\" exhibit, she excitedly exclaimed, \"Uncle George just read me a book about this!\" Before I could hear anymore, I was led away, leaving Kelly with our handler, Houston. I was then quickly taken to Bush's Re sidence Office, which here-to-fore was unfamiliar to me. Although it had slate bl ue, plush carpets and fine furnishings like the White House office, lattice work and smaller rooms provided a different air. I sat in a hard-back wooden chair as ordered, while Bush carefully positioned himself in front of me on a little wooden footstool. This allowed me clear visibility of the large book that he held in his lap. All illustrations faced me, while all text except the last page was printed in the holder's direction. This book was a unique, high tech piece of art specifically designed to enforce Bush's favorite method of programming, \"You Are What You Read\". The "},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"juvenile face depicted on the front of this hardcover book gave it the appearance of a children's storybook. It was entitled About Faces. Bush explained the dynamics of \"changing faces\" and \"becoming what I read\". Although I had been conditioned to this idea all of my life through Disney stories, The Wizard Of Oz, A lice In Wonderland, etc., I was not prepared for Bush's version of \"You Are What You Read\" programming explanations. The illustration s themselves were elaborat e, consisting of mirrors and hypnotic depictions. He seemingly made the book come alive in my mind as he read page after poetic page of hypnotic, metaphorical language, all the while creating powerful illusions. His impersonations of the characters further enhanced the desired affect of fantasy becoming reality. This extraordinary ef- fort to scramble reality would have worked-perfectly-had it not been for another victim and myself discussing it only a few days later. The purpose of Bush's book was dearly explained within the first few pages, which included the following passage: 1 am the Vice President when circumstance demands, And I am your Commander, you'll follow my commands. The first command's important - It is one you will heed, When I send you a book, you are what you read. Throughout my tenure as a Presidential Model mind-controlled slave, I was provided specific books according to Bush's program. These books, delivered through pre-established channels such as Ken Riley, Alex Houston, and even Ronald Reagan, came complete with spec ific commands on how they were to be interpreted and used. Some books were used to instruct me on operations; some were an attempt to scramble my memory w ith fantasy; others were used to load my mind with pertinent data such as bank account passbook numbers, and so on. I was provided a paperback book entitled Afghanistan, from which I absorbed history, current political ev ents, and the strength of the Afghany Freedom Fighters. I have since learned that the book I read was never publicly released in the text it was provided me . According to instruction, the book was delivered back to Bush as quickly as I finished memorizing it, I wonder in retrospect if any part of it contai ned fact beyond how I was supposed to perceive it. I read stories of espionage, including Robert Ludlum's Bourne Identity, and William Diehl's Chameleon. Mostly I was provided steamy sex novels for further training as well as scrambles. Kelly was conditioned to fairy tales, Steven Speilberg's ET, NASA NSA operati ve George Lucas' Star Wars, and the nightmarish Never Ending Story. Steinb eck's classic Of Mice and Men caused Kelly constantly to quote the dependant character of Lenny for years saying, \"Tell me what to do, George\". She stil l does this each and every time I am allowed to visit with her in the mental institution. The attending therapist over- seeing the visit has yet to pick up on th is programming cue, and I am forbidden by Juvenile Court order not to discuss Kelly's past or therapy. Bush's most effective example of \"You Are What You Read\" in his book About Faces occurred during his reading of the page depicting lizard-like \"aliens\" from a \"far-off, deep space pl ace\", Claiming to me to be an alien himself, Bush apparently activated a hologram of the lizard-like \"alien\" which provided the illusion of Bush transformin g like a chameleon before my eyes. In "},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"retrospect, I understand that Bush had be en painstakingly careful in positioning our seats in order that the hologram's effectiveness be maximized. U.S. Army Lt. Col. Aquino's occultis m provided trauma sufficient to maintain my Project Monarch Mind-Controlled existence despite his inability to affect my core spirituality. Therefore, I was not routinely subjected to the other favorite \"trauma of choice\"-alien themes-lite many slaves (including Kelly) I knew had been. The effect of Bush's illusion hologram on such victims is binding and strong. Even Aquino envied th e mind shattering effects of Bush's alien theme visual traumas to the extent that he wrote and published his own comic book sequel to Lucas' Star Wars. While occultism is easily dispelled with reason and fact, Bush's alien theme continues to be reinforced through NASA's involvement in mind-control atrocities. Additionally, California's 24- year incumbent Senator Alan Cranston of the Select Committee on Intelligence has perpetuated this trauma base for decades, as have others. Despite my having escaped routine \"alien\" theme traumas, Bush's \"You Are What You Read\" hologram proved devastatingly sufficient for him to gain total control of my robotic mind from that moment on untii my rescue in 1988. By the time Bush reached the last page of his About Faces book, I was so traumatized I instantly \"became what I read \" when I read the last verse aloud as ordered: I am a True Patriot living an American Dream, I will become my role when you pull my string. I will become my part, so I can 'be all I can be' 'Cause just like the Vice President, I am what I read."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 IN THE MEANTIME My life seemed to lead me at an accelerated pace after being subjected to Reagan and Bush. My handler, Alex Houston egotistically claimed it was his and Elemer's (his alter-ego dummy) popularity that kept us traveling so extensively within the country music ci rcuit. When we weren't traveling the Caribbean and Mexico via NCL ships, or driving his cocaine loaded motor home to strategically booked shows across the U.S., we were routinely moving in and out of Washington, D.C. All al ong the way, my daughter and I were either prostituted, used in commercial pornography, or filmed in Michael Dante's \"Chief\" bestiality pornography as ordered by Uncle Ronnie Reagan. Occasionally our travels would take us to Michigan, where Houston made certain we stayed with my family. Trips to my father's house were devastating but informative. My mother had developed deep, psychological scars above and beyond her own MPD condition and became an insomniac. My father by this time was routinely traveling to London, Germany, and Mexico, and taking the family to Florida's Disney World and Washington, D.C. My older brother, Hill, still worked for and with my father, traveled with him annually to \"hunt\" In Cheney's Greybull, Wyoming lodge, and maintained his wife and three children under trauma-base mind control according to my father's instructions. My brother, Mike, ran a video store to front some of my father's and Uncle Bob Tanis' lucrative porn video business . My sister, Kelli Jo, became a belly dancing contortionist excelling in \"gymnastics\" since she became \"as flexible as Gumby\" according to her prostitution programming. She worked her way through school in children's day-care centers, admittedly spotting, for my father, abused children for potential \"c hosen ones\" candidates. In 1990 she graduated to open a licensed day-care , \"Little Learners\" in Grand Haven, Michigan for my father. My brother, Tom (Beaver), is a Compu-Kids (CIA Project) programmed computer genius. My brother Tim broke his leg (in the same place my mother had broken his leg years before) due to following my father's sports programming above and beyond human capability. And my youngest sister, Kimmy, became hysterically obsessed with \"Mr. Rogers,\" expressed immense fear of her huge \"electric\" doll house that lit up at night to look like the White House, and was under a doctor's care for anorexia by age seven, I look forward to the day I can help them all, and justice is served on my father. Since I was using parts of my brain I would not have used under normal circumstances, I developed the ability to read backwards as naturally as I could red forwards. Houston tapped into this typically occult-based phenomenon as a means of \"scrambling\" road signs to promote amnesia of where we were traveling. He further compounded his effort by conditioning me to read phonetically and literally, and alternated his \"scrambling\" methods. \"Zoo\" became \"ooz\" and \"ooz\" translated to \"oz\". Arkansas read \"Our Kansas\", and Missouri became (and was!) \"Misery\". East became West, and highway 66 became 99. When 1 traveled, I \" literally\" did not consciously know if I were coming or going. If an outsider happened to ask me about where I'd traveled, I mechanically replied, \"The towns all ru n together and look alike after awhile.\" "},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Commands delivered in the same language twisting manner were natural for me to follow. \"Role with it\" was easier for me to become according to Reagan's acting definition than it wa s to go with the flow by \"rolling with it\". Phrases like Wyoming Senator Alan Simpson's \"In a switch of an \"I\" (personality)/ \"eye\"(hypnotic blink)/ \"i\"(the letter), complaint becomes compliant. The parts of my brain I was forced to function with were not conducive to \"normal\" thinking. Nor could 1 have appeared \"normal\" to outsiders had they cared to see beyond my superficial programmed cover personality, I did have occasion to mix with \"outsiders\" at the local library where I took Kelly for her books on days when we were not traveling. By ag e 6, she tested at the 7th grade reading level. I also emerged from my closed en vironment to tend to Kelly's schooling. She maintained straight As, but her poor attendance record threatened to violate state requirements. Once when the librarian asked where Kelly would be traveling to waive library book due dates, or the teacher inquired as to Kelly's absences, I gave the usual response of, \"the towns all run together and look alike after awhile.\" If they pressed for specifics, I ran through a series of religious phrases such as \"praise the Lo rd\", to compensate for my lack of answers. People tended to overlook and accept \"religious fanaticism\" personality peculiarities, which combined with my \"role\" traveling the country music industry, kept outsiders at a distance for years. My \"religious fanatic\" cover personal ity was cultivated at the Brentwood, Tennessee Lord's Chapel \"nondenomina tional\" (Pentecostal) church, through the CIA Operative preacher -Reverend\" B illy Roy Moore (who has since fled to Arkansas due to a local murder scandal), Moore transported cocaine from the Caribbean for the CIA, at least during the Reagan Administration, under th e guise of so-called \"missions,\" 1 i.e., Christian ministries. It most likely was not the intent of the Christians dedicated to their Caribbean ministries to be used by the CIA and Moore to inadvertently mule drugs into our co untry. Even CIA agents operating under \"need to know\" partial information were de nied the full scope of what they were actually participating in. Many se emingly willing participants were manipulated, provided \"justification,\" an d deliberately misled to believe they were serving their country, rather than destroying it from the inside out. \"Pastor\" Moore combined his knowledge of Kelly's and my programming keys, codes, and triggers with his use of metaphorical language to maintain and/or direct our mode of operation. Moore's \"following\" consisted primarily of government mind-controlled slaves and handlers, including the Mandrells. Jack Greene and his slave, the Oak Ridge Boys, and others. He instructed us on how to vote, which political issues lo su pport, and to follow other \"religious\" political leaders such as his and Manu el Noriega's friend, evangelist Jimmy Swaggart. \"Religious counseling\" from Moore equaled to maintaining mind- control programming through \"God's Orders\", And \"God's Orders\" often came by telephone, Houston constantly prostituted Kelly to anyone \"in the loop\" who was willing to pay. When she wasn't bei ng prostituted, she was being filmed pornographically. By 1984, Michael Da nte routinely filmed Kelly in pornography, since kiddie porn was as lucrative as bestiality. He filmed Kelly and me in Las Vegas, Nevada and va rious other locations throughout the Caribbean, California, Florida, Tennessee , and in my home state of Michigan. "},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":" This created professional conf lict with long lime kiddie pornographers formerly associated with Houston. Houston's close friend in Waycross, Georgia, pedophile Jimmy Walker, managed the Okefenokee Swamp Park and had participated in black budget funding operations for years on both the cocaine and pornography levels. Hi s counterpart, Dick Flood, refused to participate to any more pornography after Dante came on the scene. Even the Huntsville, Alabama NASA/DIA/CIA-appoint ed \"law enforcement\" officers could rarely succeed in their biddi ng for Kelly's video taped performances unless directly ordered by Senator Byrd. Dante considered himself her future owner as well as mine, and maintained control of our porn \"business\" ventures through serious U.S. Government and international Mafia methodisms/ connections. Jimmy Walker, the same photogr apher who had taken pornographic \"wedding night\" pictures for Larry Flynt, recently had other photographs of me published in Hustler. When Dante found out, he was furious. Larry Flynt and Dante both worked for the CIA, had Vatican and Mafia connections, and deliberately appealed to Reagan's pe rversions using project Monarch Mind- Controlled slaves. What Flynt could not \"legally\" publish, Dante ran through the underground. Flynt and Dante lived on oposite coasts, which, despite their similarities, still was not far enough apar t to sooth their differences. Waving his hands in dramatic Italian gestures. Dante furiously spouted a string of obscenities over Flynt's publishing photos of what he deemed \"his property\", Accusing Flynt of going to extremes to gain favor/protection from the government, Dante shouted, \"He's a bigger whore than the girls he promotes!\" Michael Dante's pornographic filming abilities served several purposes. Aside from producing porn according to Reagan's own (well known) perversions and instructions, Dante was present during many key international government \"gatherings\". Oftentimes when I and others were prostituted to various government (New World Order) leaders, Dante had hidden cameras filming perverse sexual acts apparently for future blackmail leverage. These videos were scandalous in proportion and were usually ordered by Reagan. Dante turned the videos over to Reagan, and covertly kept copies to protect himself. Dante converted a small room of his Beverly Hills mansion into a security vault, where he kept his person al copies of the international blackmail porn tapes there. Among these internationally scandalous tapes are numerous videos covertly produced at the supposedly secure political sex playground in northern California, Bohemian Grove. According to Houston, Dante's high tech undetectable cameras used fi ber optics, and fish-eye lens were in each of the elite club's numerous sexual perversion theme rooms. My knowledge of these cameras was due to the strategically compromising positions of the political perpetrators I was prostituted to in the various kinky theme rooms. I was programmed and equipped to func tion in all rooms at Bohemian Grove in order to compromise specific governme nt targets according to their personal perversions. \"Anything, anytime, anyw here with anyone\" was my mode of operation at the Grove. I do not purport to understand the full function of this political cesspool playground as my perception was limited to my own realm of experience. My perception is that Bohemian Grove serves those ushering in the New World Order through mind control, a nd consists primarily of the highest Mafia and U.S. Government officials. I do not use the term \"highest\" loosely, as copious quantities of dr ugs were consumed there. Project Monarch Mind- "},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Control slaves were routinely abused there to fulfill the primary purpose of the club: purveying perversion. Bohemian Grove is reportedly intended to be used recreationally, providing a supposedly secure environment for politically affluent individuals to \"party\" without restraint. The only business c onducted there pertained to implementing the New World Order, through the prol iferation of mind-control atrocities, giving the place an air of \"Masonic Secrecy\". The only room where business discussions were permitted was the smal l, dark lounge affectionately and appropriately referred to as the Underground. 2 Sex slaves were not routinely permitted in the Underground for security reasons, leaving the lounge's small stage as the only s ource of \"entertainment\". This entertainment ranged from would-be talents such as Lee Atwater, Bill Clinton, and George Bush to CIA Operative entertainers such as Boxcar Willie and Lee Greenwood, On one occasion I was instructed to meet with former President Gerald Ford in the Underg round where Lee Atwater was picking and singing. As I waited through the smoke- filled room to Ford's table, Atwater interrupted his song to cryptically acknowledge my unwelcome presence by singing choruses of \"Over the Rainbow \" and Byrd's song for me \"Country Roads\" while emphasizing the lines of \"Almost heaven, West Virginia\". My purpose at the Grove was sexual in nature, and therefore my perceptions were limited to a sex slave's viewpoint. As an effective means of control to ensure undetected proliferation of their perverse indulgences, slaves such as myself were subjected to ritualistic tr auma. I knew each breath I took could be my last, as the threat of death lurked in every shadow. Slaves of advancing age or with failing programming were sacrificially murdered \"at random\" in the wooded grounds of Bohemian Grave, and I fell it was \"simply a matter of time until it would be me\". Rituals were held at a giant, concrete owl monument on the banks of, ironically enough, the Russi an (rushin') River. These occultish sex rituals stemmed from the scientific belief that mind-controlled slaves required severe trauma to ensure comp artmentalization of the memory, and not from any spiritual motivation. My own threat of death was instilled when I witnessed the sacrificial death of a young, dark-haired victim at which time I was instructed to perform sexually \"as though my life depended upon it\". I was told, \"...the next sacrifice victim could be you. Anytime when you least expect it, the owl will consume you. Prepare yourself, and stay prepared.\" Being \"prepared\" equated to being totally suggestible, i.e., \"on my toes\" awaiting their command. After returning to Tennessee, Houston attempted to distort my Bohemian Grove experience by instructing me to \"prepare myself for imminent death\". He ordered me into a bathtub of cold wate r, placed ice cubes in my vagina, then transferred me to his bed. There he tied a coroner' s type tag on my toe, and hypnotically deepened my trance to the point where my heart and breathing were nearly stopped. Then he gratifie d himself on my cold, still body through faux necrophilia—reportedly one of his favorite perversions. Houston had \"perfected\" his perversion to the extent that he handed the keys to my death- state programming to Lt. Col. Michael Aquino for use in Reagan's Hands-On Mind-Control Demonstrations. My death-st ate also further equipped me in my role of \"anything, anytime, anywhere w ith anyone\" to be accessed at Bohemian Grove. The club offered a \"Necrophilia\" theme room to its members. I was so heavily drugged and programmed when us ed in the \"necrophilia\" room, that the"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"threat of actually \"slipping through death' s door\" and being sacrificed \"before I knew it\" did not affect me. My whole existence was balanced precariously on the edge of death as a matter of routine anyway. My robotic state did not permit me the \"luxury\" of self-preserva tion, and I could only do exactly what I was told to do. My necroph ilia room experience was only for the purpose of providing Dante a compromising film of a targeted member anyway. Other perversion theme rooms at the Bohemian Club included what I heard Ford refer to as the \"Dark Room\". When he not so cleverly said, \"Let's go to the Dark Room and see what develops,\" I understood from experience that he was interested in indulging in his perverse obsession for pornography. In the Dark Room, members had sex with the same mind-controlled slave they were viewing in porn on a big screen television. There was a triangular glass display centered in a main through way where I was locked in with various trained animals, including snakes. Members walking by watched elicit sex acts of bestiality, women with women, mothers with daughters, kids with kids, or any other unlimited perverse visual display. I was once brutally assaulted by Dick Cheney in the Leather Room, which was designed tike a dark, black leather- lined train berth. As 1 crawled through the leather flaps covering the narrow entrance, 1 heard Cheney play on the word \"berth/birth\" as the soft blackness engulfed me. With the small opening covered, the blinding darkness enhanced the sense of touch and provided an option of anonymity. Cheney jokingly claimed that I \"blew his cover\" when I recognized his all-too-familiar voic e and abnormally large penis size. There was a room of shackles and tortures, black lights and strobes, an opium den, ritualistic sex altars, a chapel, group orgy rooms including poster beds, water beds, and \"kitten\" houses. I was used as a \"rag doll\" in the \"toy store,\" and as a urinal in the \"golden arches\" room. From the owl's roost to th e necrophilia room, no memory of sexual abuse is as horrifying as the conversations overheard in the Underground pertaining to implementing the New World Order. I le arned that perpetrators believed that controlling the masses through propaga nda mind manipulation did not guarantee there would be a world left to dominate due to environmental and overpopulation problems. The so lution being debated was not pollution/population control, but mass genocide of \"selected undesirables.\" 1 Moore often operated under the cloak of World Vision. 2 The wooden sign was carved to read: U.N.DERGROUND"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19 E.T. PHONE ROME Anyone attending the Bohemian Grove on a regular basis was referred to by those in the know as a \"Grover\". One su ch Grover was Ronald Reagan's then- Secretary of Education, Bi ll Bennett, Bill Bennett, who later became \"Drug Czar\" during the Bush Administration, wr ote the so-called Book of Virtues and was/is? vying for the office of President. Bennett is apparently very close to his brother and fellow Grover, Bob Bennet t. Although Bob Bennett holds the position of Legal Counsel to President Clinton, it is apparent that the brothers recognize no party lines. It was clear to me that there were no partisan differences amongst those ushering in the New World Order, any more than there was loyalty to our Constitution. The close relationship I witnessed between the Bennett brothers, like the marriage between Clinton's and Bush's 1992 campaign managers James Carville and Mary Matlin, should ra ise questions as to their agenda, When Bill and Bob Bennett together sexually assaulted my daughter, Kelly, and me at the Bohemian Grove in 1986, I had already known Bill Bennett as a mind-control programmer for some time. Bennett anchored his Jesuit/Vatican based programming of me in my Catholic conditioning initially instilled via the Rite to Remain Silent. Through fu rther manipulation of my \"inner- dimensional\" perceptions, Bennett believ ed he had forever compartmentalized his personal secrets of perverse sex with his brother, Bob, and my then six-year- old daughter. Bennett also had manipulated my mind in accordance with Vatican \"Orders\" via Byrd's Jesuit College programming center in West Vir- ginia. He used his role as Jesuit pr ogrammer for the purposes of carrying out his efforts as Education Secretar y to implement Education 2000. 1 In order to program my mind for my role in bringing Education 2000 into the \"Volunteer State\" of Tennessee's school system, Bennett used sophisticated mind manipulation to set the stage— the same kind of mind manipulation propaganda executed on national and intern ational scale, Benne tt's penchant for manipulating minds is apparently rooted in his knowledge of Catholic/Jesuit mind-control techniques. When I met Bennett at a White House co cktail party in 1984, I was wearing the rosy cross necklace that Guy VanderJagt and Father Don had presented to me during my first communion, to signify the mode of program I was operating under at the time. Byrd had ordered that I wear it for the occasion. Byrd was already talking with Bennett when a White House butler led me in to see Byrd. 2 Byrd was saying, \"I was just talking about you with my friend, Secretary of Education 3 William Bennett.\" \"Bill,\" Bennett corrected, sweeping his lecherous gaze over me as though I were merchandise. \"How do you do?\" '\"As I am told, thank you,\" I said as I extended my hand as trained. Bennett clumsily fingered the rosy cross necklace, blowing his alcoholic breath in my face as he said, \"Your neck lace is as beautiful as you are, and no doubt, as significant in pu rpose. Where did this come from and what does it mean to you?\" \"From my first communion,\" I responded. \"Guy (Byrd interrupted to clarify 'VanderJagt') gave it to me to consummate my holy communion.\""},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"  Byrd corrected me, \"Commemorate your holy communion.\" \"She doesn't need a translator, Bobb y,\" Bennett laughed, \"I'm hearing her loud and clear.\" Byrd left me with Bennett, wh o went into a long winded recitation on an interpretation of the Bible deliberately intended to further distort my Catholic instilled perceptions. \"Christ was an alien in this land,\" he was saying in accordance with his learned Jesuit mind manipulation techniques. \"Once he landed in Earth's plane, it was plain to see he was a leader in interdimensional travel, We (Jesuits/aliens) followed his lead since he was the first to slip into Earth's dimension. In Christ 's transformation from porpoise 4 to purpose, he lost his will to Earth's demands. He lost his porpoise, so to speak.\" Totally \"trance-fixed,\" I listened as Bennett rall ied on and on. \"When Christ emerged from the deep to inhale of Earth's atmo sphere, time began ticking. It was not recognized or acknowledged until Christ 's passing, however. We began marking time with his death. BC-AD-or is that AC-DC?\" Referring to high voltage used to compartmentalize memory, he continued, 'No, AC in DC stops time. At any rate, we followed his lead , He referred to you as sheep. He knew you needed to be led. He led us. He led you. He led us to you. We're here to lead you. The transformation is perfected now, updated with the latest in alien technologies whereby we no longer have to follow Chri st's course to the grave. We can transcend dimensions free of the confines of Earth's gravitational pull. The time is now, and we are here to lead you. We know your mind. That's how we make you mind. Make you mine. Make you a mind. Make you mine. Journey with me now...\" Bennett manipulated my perceptions unt il, at last, he informed me, \"You and 1 will be working closely together on a global education project.\" Sweeping his hand around the crowded room, he co ntinued, \"This atmosphere is not conductive to the kind of work we need to be doing. Something else just came up that demands immediate attention. Le t's complete tonight's business with pleasure, beat it out of this dimensi on, suspend your susp ended animation, and get with the program.\" In one of many White House bedrooms available for such purposes, Bennett led me into bed. I told you we were going to beat it out of this dimension, and that ' s exactly what I intend to do. A little Byrd told me you like a whip. Since I am not the Senate kind, I'll just represent the majority by giving you what you need most.\" Bennett apparently found perverse pleasu re in whipping me. With my wrists bruised and my body slinging with pain, Bennett lit up a cigarette and cryptically asked, \"Was that your first cum-union with an alien?\" He threw me my clothes, and ordered, \"Make yourself presentable. Make sure your wrists are covered. I'm not waiting around for you, I'll see you in THE morning.\" Bennett left. After awhile I was escort ed back to Byrd, with whom I spent a brutal, short night. On the way to his room, Byrd told me, \"You've got work to do come morning with Mr. Bennett. Working for him is like working for me. We are working in conjunction with the state Governors in an effort to implement the global 2000 e ducation formula for the future. I am excited at the prospect of meddling in the future through what I accomplish today. Since I hold this country's purse strings, it is up to me to delegate as much funding as is neccessary to implement the educational program. I've withheld f unding and withheld funding to the point where the individual states must rely on federal "},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"funding to get them out of hot water fina ncially. I am ready to do just that so long as they follow my guidelines. Mr. Bennett is working out the details of this plan, and will be sharing much of th at with you. I need you to do what you do best by enlisting the full cooperati on of state government at the upcoming Governor's Convention. I have neve r demanded Conventional sex of you before, but this time is different. Persuade these Governors at their weakest moment—bring them to their knees while you are on yours, and convince them that global education is the gateway to the future if there is to be any future at all.\" Early the next morning, deep underg round in the NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center mind-control lab near D.C., Bill Bennett began preparing me for the program. NASA uses various \"CIA desi gner drugs\" to chemically alter the brain and create exactly the mind set required at the time, Huntsville, Alabama's NASA drug of choice, \"Train-qui lity,\" created a feeling of absolute, peaceful compliance and a sensation of walking on air. The drug administered this time was sufficiently similar to Tranquility to create total compliance. The bearing I had endured the night before had rendered me helpless, anyway, and I could barely crawl up onto the cold, metal lab table as the drug took effect. In the darkness surrounding me, I could hear Bill Bennett talking, \"This is my brother, Bob. He and I work as one unit. We are alien to this dimension- two beings from another plane.\" The high-tech light display swirling around me convinced me I was transforming dimensions with them, A lase r of light hit the black wall in front of me, which seemed to explode into a panoramic view of a White House cocktail party-as though I had transformed dimensions and stood amongst them. Not recognizing anyone, I frantically asked, \"Who are these people?\" . \"They're not people, and this isn't a spaceship/ Bennett said. As he spoke, the holographic scene changed ever so slightly until the people appeared to be lizard-like aliens. \"Welcome to the second level of the underground. This level is a mere/(mirror) reflection of the first, an alien dimension. We are from a transdirnensional plane that spans and encompasses all dimensions.\" \"Infinite dimensions,\" Bob injected, \"Infinite dimensions spanned si- multaneously-\" Bill said, \"No limitations\".

Dressed \"to Order,\" I wore a slinky, black dress that gathered at one hip decorated in rubies, with a red rose barrette in my hair. \"The Chief called for her,\" my Secret Service escort told the butler as he left me at the door. The lights were dim and the air was formal as the butler led me through the unusually large crowd of people. He released my elbow, aiming me in the direction of then President Ronald Reagan, As I walked through the crowd toward Reagan, I saw familiar faces associated with the ''Order of the Rose. 1 \" Across the room, Bill and Bob Bennett were laughing with Dick Cheney. Then-Governor of Pennsylvania Dick Thornburgh was engaged in conve rsation with Senator Arlen Spector. Within the farthest reaches of my ex panded peripheral vision, I saw George Bush talking with his U.N. confidant Madeleine Albright 2 , Knowing I could see him as though I had eyes in the back of my head, Bush subtly signaled me to join them. \"You know Madeleine Albright,\" Bush began, Expertly using terminology from previously instilled Catholic Jesuit beliefs, he continued, \"She's the reverend mother of all sisters (slaves). Sh e's so close to God that an order from her is an order from Him.\" Albright snickered, apparently impressed with Bush's \"witty\" manipulation of progra m verbiage. \"She rose in the U.N. through me to implement th e New World peace process.\" Albright said to me, \"I hear you're a world (whirled?) piece\". \"Who told you that?\" Bush demanded. \"Larry Flynt, for her stint in Jamaica 3 ,\" she quickly explained. Bush threw up his hand in apparent disgust at the idea of sex relating to someone with two digits in their age. \"Spare me,\" he said. \"That's my job,\" Albright said matter-of-factly with a smile of pride. She shooed me away while condescendingly saying, I'll see you tomorrow at the OAS (Organization of American States ) office. Now, you run along and go play.\" Noting that her nonspecific orde rs left me unable to determine which way to turn, literally, she aimed me back in the direction of Reagan. Reagan was dressed in a dark, navy blue suit and red silk tie. His red rosebud 4 boutonniere instantly triggered me into a Jesuit \"Order of the Rose\" sex slave mode. \"Well, hello, Kitten,\" Reagan said, blowing his cognac breath in my face as he bent over to kiss my hand. \"Uncle Ronnie...\" I said, sexually responding as conditioned. Reagan turned to the man beside him and said, \"Brian, this is one more of those benefits of the New World Order I was telling you about. Kitten, this is Brian Mulroney, Prime Minister of Canada.\" The connotations of my childhood experience with the former Prime Minister\" of Canada, Pierre Trudeau, suggested that Mulroney was Jesuit—as did the mode I was operating in. He, too, was wearing a red rose boutonniere signifying his involvem ent and commitment to the Order of the Rose. \"It's a pleasure to meet you, Sir,\" I said as I extended my hand."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"\"The pleasure is mine,\" Mulroney said as he kissed my hand, \"Please, call me Brian.\" \"Yes, Sir, Brian,\" I responded, my brain still whirling with the NASA designer drugs. Chuckling but insisient, Mulroney reiterated, \"I am not a Sir\". Reagan jumped in, \"He is a Prime Minister, which means he is more important than your average Minister, an d certainly more important than any Sir. Brian is my friend.\" \"Oh, Brian,\" I said, finally understanding, \"O'Brien is her father's name,\" Reag an told Mulroney, \"She is of Irish descent and hails from Michigan.\" Brian turned to me, \"I've been in your neck of the woods here recently-in one of my favorite get-aways-on Mackinac Island,\" \"Mackinac Island was her launch point into the project,\" Reagan explained in terms used by those familiar with mind-control operations. Mulroney apparently was aware of my mind-controlle d state and leered at me as though I were merchandise, Reagan noticed his inte rest and proceeded to function in the capacity of a pimp. \"I highly recommend you take her along with the rest. She is an excellent game piece for you to us e in any position. And there's security. Her head is in the ethers and come tomorrow, she wouldn't knew you from the man in the moon. I'll give you the keys later.\" Expertly using Order of the Rose signals and triggers, Mulroney said, \"Just give me the key to her heart, and she's mine.\" \"You are wise in the ways of the world,\" Reagan commented. \"I have to be on top of things. It's a New World Order,\" Mulroney said matter-of-factly. As a guard led me away, I heard Reagan tell Mulroney, \"You will be on top of the world soon\". I was searched by uniformed Canadian bodyguards and pointed in the direction of one of the White House' s many bedroom suites. When I opened the door, I saw three blonde sex slaves undressing and preparing the bed—one of whom was my close friend and Senator Arlen Spector's slave. I excitedly called my friend's name. \"W hat are you doing here?\" I asked as we hugged each other. \"Small world,\" she said, as she always did when we were thrust together in various places for prostitution and/or po rnography. This universal term was often used among those familiar with th e Small, Small World Disney-developed mind-control program. I hugged my friend again, \"Wow, it is a small world. I'm so glad you're here.\" I had no comprehension of our predicament and could not see beyond the moment \"Hell girls! It is a small world!\" Mulroney entered and strode across the room, tossing his coat on a chair and loos ening his tie. \"Watch it get smaller and smaller as we rocket further and fu rther away.\" He slipped out of his shoes, suspenders, and pants while he continued his hypnotic metaphors. \"Soaring through the sea of black space. As the world gets smaller and smaller and smaller, then sinks into the black sea of space.\" Removing his boxer shorts, he announced, \"I brought you here for a purpose...\" and proceeded to access our sex programming. In retrospect I know it was no coin cidence that my friend and I were brought together to satisfy Brian Mu lroney's perversion for mind-controlled "},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"slaves. Identically mirror programmed, we operated in unison. The delicate red rose tatoo on my friend's left wrist signified her enslavement to the (New World) Order of the Rose to which Mulroney belonged. My friend and her young daughter repor tedly were often transported across the U.S.-Canadian border at Niagara Fa lls for prostitution to Mulroney. The sexual abuse of her precious child was used as a trauma base to maintain control of her mind just as Kelly's abuse traumatized me, Mulroney had previously accessed sex programming at Niagara Fall s in my friend and me-along with our daughters-to satisfy his sanctioned perversions as though it were \"business as usual\". Had I been capable of connecting events, I would have felt enormous relief that our daughters were not forced to participate in his sexuaJ assault this time. \"Mission\" complete, I slipped on my dr ess and prepared to leave, Mulroney pointed to me and cryptically said, \"I 'll be seeing you around. Maybe I'll see you in Mackinac. May be. somewhere in time.\" In three lines, Mulroney expertly tied the immediate moment to childhood cues and current Mexican NAFTA operations, as well as prepared me for my next encounter with him on Mackinac Island, 1 \"The Order of the Rose\" was an emblem of those ushering in the New World Order. \"Orders from the Rose\" were orders From George Bush. 2 Reagan first introduced me to U.N. Ambassad or Madeleine Albrighi as \"my mentor\" in Jesuit operations in the Caribbean \"Madeleine Albright is a Saint,\" Reagan told me, forming my perception of her \"The Mother Teresa of the Caribbean.' 3 While I was in Jamaica under Albright's (via Bush's) instruction, Larry Flynt photographers took advantage of my being there to use the pictur esque Dunns River Falls as a backdrop for pornographic photos to be used in Hustler. 4 Reagan's red rose triggered a sexual mode usually used to co mpromise/blackmail dignitaries and lock them into lo yalty to the Order of the Rose. "},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 21 GLOBAL EDUCATION 2000 My programmed role toward implemen ting Education 2000 according to the plans of those ushering in the New Wo rld Order brought me back in contact with former Governor of Tennessee, Lama r Alexander, and eventually Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, I had met Lamar Alexander in 1973, at a satanic ritual I was subjected to in an affluent neighborhood of Nashville, Tennessee. Lamar Alexander presided over this sex-oriented occult ritual with full understanding of my Project Monarch Mind-Control victimization and the impact his actions were having on my mind. It was my experience then, an d intermittently throughout the years, that Lamar Alexander's sexual perversion wa s to bring his victim to the point of death through oral suffocation. During the course of publicly expo sing Tennessee's need for education reform as instructed, I was in contac t with Commissioners, Superintendents, Mayors, and Lamar Alexander. Lamar Alexander, who followed Bennett as Bush's Secretary of Education, worked in close association with Bill Bennett to manipulate the minds of the masses to accept Education 2000 as the ONLY means of education reform. When Ned McWherter was moved into the office of Governor to rubber stamp federal projects, Lamar Alexander maintained influence over state politics. At the same time, he maintained influence over national politics through his role as chairman of the National Governor's Association in 1986. As the J984 Governor's Convention drew near, I met with Lamar Alexander at the Stockyard nightclub where he was drinking with his long time associate and partner-in-crime, Nashville's Mayor Richard Fulton. In the basement bar of this old, converted stockyard was a modified antique \"Shoe Shine\" booth, where the term took on new meaning. A key to a private shoeshine booth could be obtained by those in the know through Stockyard owner, Buddy Killen. This closet-sized booth was lined in mirro rs and had a small bench where Lamar Alexander sat after our business was conclu ded. I knelt at his feet as ordered to perform oral sex. Programmed sex slaves such as myself were trained to go long periods of time without drawing a breath, and users such as Alexander stretched this time to the maximum. 1 On this occasion, Alexander apparently exceeded the maximum. 1 do not recall completion of my programmed task . It was afterhours when my mind- control handler, Alex Houston, dra gged my limp body from the booth, roused me, and ordered me out of the building. Buddy Killen opened a back door that once was a cattle run, and Houston hal f-dragged me out the back exit unseen. The night of the Convention, Alex Houston's youngest daughter, Bonnie, 2 was to join me. Bonnie and E were clos e to the same age, and together we dressed for the occasion. As a pros titute, Bonnie was familiar with Lamar Alexander and his perversions but nevert heless was excited at the prospect of seeing \"old friends\" at the Convention via Louise Mandrell, 3 who would be entertaining there. The comradery between Alex Houston and trby Mandrell that developed during Bob Hope's U.S.O. tours in the 1960s lasted for decades due to their shared involvement in running mind-controlled slaves for Byrd. "},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Bonnie shared in this friendship with the Mandrells and was looking forward to seeing her \"friends\" in the band. I, too, was looking forward to talking with Louise Mandrell, but for a very different reason. Barbara had just endur ed her near-fatal car crash, and I was deeply concerned for her welfare. Throughout the 1980s while traveling under the guise of the Country Music Industry, Alex Houston toured with Barbara and/or Louise Mandrell on a regular basis. Occasionally Barbara and I saw each other in \"church,\" the Hendersonville Lord's Chapel. This church was an offshoot of Billy Roy Moore's Lord's Chapel, and was pastored by his mind- controlled slave, Mike Nelson, who became close friends with Barbara. 4 Alex Houston and I were present when Mike Nelson broke program, and attempted to flee for his Life with Barbara Mandrell. The pastor was subdued with a stun gun and immediately relieved of his posit ion, while Barbara frantically sought answers to the questions the two of them had managed to raise. Alex Houston was touring with Louise Mandrel] in 1984 when Louise had a \"premonition\" of Barbara's imminent de mise—much the same way Loretta Lynn \"psychicly predicted\" her son's murder. Like the murders of Loretta's son and Country Music entertainer Keith Whitley , I was aware of Barbara's planned accident before it occurred due to Al ex Houston's direct involvement. These traumas were also used as a means of lo cking in my mind-controlled belief that I had \"no where to run and no where to hide\". Worst of all, I could not think to speak of what I knew due to my ow n absolute mind control. While Barbara physically survived her ordeal, he r voice was silenced as planned. When Bonnie and I arrived at Opryland Hotel, we hurried to the ballroom where Louise Mandrell would be performing. My concern for Barbara detracted me from my appointment with Lamar Alexander until one of Louise's dancers who knew of my role put me \"back on track\". \"What are you doing here?\" he demanded. \"You're supposed to be at Rhett Butler's restaurant NOW.\" I hurried to the restaurant where La mar Alexander was having dinner with Senator Byrd and several governors. Byrd was participating in the function for reasons unknown to me, but 1 was aware th at he had fiddled at the Opry. Byrd stopped eating just long enough to ac knowledge my presence, \"Where have you been?\" \"I was checking on Barbara over at th e show,\" 1 replied as Lamar Alexander excused himself and walked over. Putting an arm around me and turning me away from the table, he whispered, \"You could wind up just like her if you don't get with the program. You've got programs to hand out. But right now, you're interrupting my dinner. Have you had anything to drink?\". \"No, Sir,\" I replied, traumatized at the magnitude of his threat. Lamar Alexander instructed me to le ave immediately, order a grasshopper from the conservatory bar, and wait for further instructions. It was a matter of routine for me to order a \"grasshopper\" from Opryland Hotel's conservatory. The ice cream \"dri nk\" was specially made—always with a hypnotic drug in it. As sometimes happened, the waitress was unfamiliar with the process, and conservatory harp player and CIA operative Lloyd Lindroth interceded. The drug had the same effect as that administered at the D.C. NASA programming center by Bennett, and my mode was robotic compliance. After the drug kicked in, Lloyd Lindroth instructed me to proceed to the main ballroom of the Hotel, where La mar Alexander would be meeting me."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":" The outer lobby of the ballroom was decorated in wall-size murals that extended to the top of the gothic ceiling. A life- size steam engine depicted on the far wall appeared to be racing toward the grand staircase. I had seen the murals numerous times before, but never had they se emed so real as they did to me that night on the NASA drug. The heavy double doors leading to the ballroom caused me to feel very small as I pulled with all my strength to open it. Inside, the room was a sea of black suits and ties, and I was relieved when Lamar Alexander ushered me back out into the lobby. Alexander positioned me near the train mural as a cryptic indicator to those in the know ihat I was a \"trained\" mind- controlled slave. I was provided a box of brown envelopes packed with the E ducation 2000 information I was to hand out to the governors. Alexander instructed me on exactly what I was to say in conjunction with the message Bennett had programmed me with in D.C. Then he returned to the ballroom, where he ap parently acted in the capacity of a pimp. \"Are you waiting on the tr ain?\" a paunchy governor asked, \"No, Sir,\" I answered. Then, as instructed, I said, \"But 1 do have a packet of information with your name on it. Shall 1 take it to your room for you?\" \"Oh? And what is my name?\" he asked. \"Governor,\" I responded. There actua lly were no names on the envelopes. \"Astute,\" he responded. \"And what is it you have for me?\" \"This packet,\" I answered, handing it to him. \"And anything else you want compliments of Lamar Alexander and (t apped) Secretary of Education, Bill Bennett.\" According to some of the men, Alexande r had cued them as to my position. Others, such as then Governor of Pe nnsylvania, Dick Thornburgh and Ohio Governor Dick Celeste already knew me, \"I've got a packet of information with your name on it.. \"I was saying as I bent over to lift one from the box. \"I don't think so,\" Governor Blanch ard of Michigan interrupted. \"Bill (Bennett) wouldn't stoop so low as to insult me that way. I'm doing the same thing here you are, but from a very di fferent approach. The figures I offer reflect the success of Education 2000 in the Michigan school system.\" I recognized Governor Blanchard, and was well aware of Michigan's ranking first in the nation in education. \"Speaking of which,\" he continued, \"I believe I see your mother more often than you do these days since she is working in the schools. That little sist er of yours (Kimmy) is a prime example of what proper instruction can produce. Your little sister is coming to Mackinac to further her skills. Your whole family is a prime example of how good Education 2000 works.\" I finally met up with Bonnie again in Lamar Alexander's room as the night came to a close. \"Bonnie, how's that sn ake of yours?\" he asked. Bonnie, who had been filmed pornographically by CIA commercial photographer Jimmy Walker with Dick Flood's snakes, had a pel boa consticter, \"Great!\" Bonnie laughed. \"How's yours?\" \" Constricted,\" he replied, Bonnie unzipped his pants as she admittedly had done numerous times in the past, playfully sayings \"Let it loose!\" Lamar Alexander began removing his pants. Referring to me in Project Monarch terms he said, \"When 1 first sa w you, you were a worm with no hint of being a butterfly.\""},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"\"Daddy (Alex Houston) said she was a diamond in the rough,\" Bonnie volunteered, \"She shines now\". Turning to me he said, \"I know you are a shoe shiner, and mine need a shine.\" Bonnie, also familiar with the Stockyard booth and Lamar Alexander's meaning, laughed when he said , \"Why don't you both take a foot.\" Task complete, I went to Byrd's nearby room as instructed. He was in the bathroom preparing himself for bed, \"Louise had her feathers fuffled over Barbara's collision with destiny and 1 had to smooth them down a bit,\" Drying his dough grey hands on a towel, he turned to me and said, \"Looks lite you've had your wings spread a bit tonight.\" \"I wore a path up and down the stairs,\" I stated. Much to my relief he said, \"I'm not going to fiddle with you farther. I just wanted to give you something to remember me by--Bye.\" He compartmentalized my memory with his stun gun. Soon thereafter, Kelly and I were transp orted to Mackinac Island. Michigan to meet with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney at then-Governor James Blanchard's mansion. Houston led Kelly and me to a horse drawn carriage as quickly as we stepped off the ferryboat onto the timeless, antiquated island, I noticed that the Canadian flags were again flying at the Grand Hotel, but was of no mind to question, Kelly sat quietly beside me, apparently drugged as our carriage took us through the woods to the Governor's mansion. The guests in the mansion were reminiscent of the recent Tennessee Governor's convention: Michigan Govern or Blanchard, Ohio Governor Dick Celeste, and Pennsylvania Governor Dick Thornburgh. Guy VanderJagt and Jerry Ford were also present. Mulrone y appeared to be the guest of \"honor\". He reached out his hands and greete d me, \"I told you I would see you somewhere in time! I slipped time, space, and distance to be here this evening. You and I have some ground to cover.\" \"Yes, Sir. President Reagan's Global Education Secretary Bill Bennett has sent me to deliver this education pack et directly to you.\" I was to deliver a large, brown envelope of document s similar to those handed out at the Governor's Convention. Blanchard excused himself. \"I've alrea dy heard the schpiel,\" he said as he turned to his other guests, le aving Mulroney and me alone, \"Global Education is the wave of the future,\" I recited as programmed. As the world gets smaller and smaller due to higher technology spanning the globe, our children must be educated in the ways of the world. Education as it is, barely equips them for life in their own backyard. We need to become involved in our children's education for the sake of their future and our legacy. Global education is the way. The only way, Look into it...\" I handed him the envelope. \"...Peer into the future.\" Mulroney uncrossed his arms long enough to accept the envelope, which he casually tossed on a chair. \"I am interest ed in the children, the legacy we leave them, and how we shape their future by th e way we record our history in their test.\" Using Order of the Rose cues, he signalled me to photographically record his words for future delivery. \"Tell Mr . Bennett(sss),\" he hissed, cryptically revealing his knowledge that Bill and Bob Bennett worked together using reptilian-alien themes, \"implementation is high. I ' m already sold on Global 2000 and have additional points I would lik e for them to consider. Headsets at "},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"every computer station for openers. Double the impact with dual learning. We're being thrust forward at warp speed, and the generations of the future may need an added booster to bring them up to speed. A united global effort using your education package as a basis is destin ed to bring the future into a clear and present reality.\" Business complete, Mulroney triggere d my sex programming and led me upstairs to the bedrooms where Kelly was robotically waiting, entranced under Orders of the Rose, 1 I have witnessed girls die of suffocation fro m this practice oven though 3 to 5 minutes without breathing is common. 2 While Bonnie was not raised in Project Monarch, Houston's pedophilia and stage hypnosis techniques rendered Bonnie unable to control her own actions. Bonnie is a multiple with a record of prostitution in need of therapy and care. 3 Irby Mandrell openly discussed Senator Byrd's direct involvement in the Project Monarch government mind-controlled victimizations of his incestuously abused daughters with Houston. \"Having babies can be a lucrat ive way to feather your nest-tha t's what the Byrd taught me.\" Mandrel! continued, \"Louise was a little withdraw n, and she needed to come out of her cocoon and spread her wings. I ran the idea by Byrd, an d he said 'If she doesn't have a talent, let's make her one. What is a band without a fiddle?' And viola, there she is . Another star on the rise launched from NASA City, USA (Huntsville, Alabama).\" 4 Friendships between mind-controlled slaves are usually forbidden, and conversations are kept to a minimum lest cross-programing tri ggering occurs. Throughout the years, my own relationship with the Mandrells was limited to a superficial basis, whereas Irby Mandrell employed Houston's hypnotic abilities to main tain mind control over his daughters while touring. "},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 22 MY CONTRA-BUTION U.S. and Mexican relations were flou rishing in th e successes of NAFTA's groundwork, while polictical differences pertaining to Nicaragua remained a minor point of contention. Since the Ca tholic Vatican's Intelligence arm of Jesuits were working closely wilh U.S. Intelligence to usher in the New World Order, they used their established influe nce in Mexico and Nicaragua to provide a common ground for \"diplomatic relati ons\". My dual mind-control victi- mazation by the ClA and the Jesuits sinc e childhood, and my previous \"diplo- matic relations\" in Mexico thrust me into the role of messenger and prostitute to Nicaragua's Daniel Oriega. Were President Reagan's Nicaraguan Fr eedom Fighters figh ters OF freedom or FOR freedom? My mind-controlled exis tence rendered me incapable of pon- dering such questions. Nevertheless, I had a programmed \"passion burning in my bosom\" for the Contras as was patriotically instilled through torture, when I embarked on my \"peacekeeping mission\" to Nicaragua for Reagan tale in the summer of 1985, I boarded NCL as usual to reach my a ppointed destination. Since Nicaragua was not a port of call for NCL, I flew fro m the Yukatan of Mexico to a remote military airstrip in Managua. It was in t h i s small mountain top clearing that I met with Commandant Daniel Ortega, as had been arranged through the Vatican. I was dressed seasonably in shorts, with my long blond hair lucked hack in a French braid. Onega's attire, too, was reflective of the casual a i r to meeting. His tan, military uniform had worn thin, and was free of any protocol insignias. The dark, rose-colored sunglasses he peered through apparently had not changes his somber view of the \"noble cause\" he claimed to represent. A man of few words, he greeted me with an or der, \"Come with me.\" I rode wilh him in silence as he drove a jeep the short distance across the airstrip to a small, near, two story, white, frame house. As we came to a stop in front of the house, Ortega said In a sad, slow voice. \"I have needs like any man. But I feel like a whore myself for accepting your President's offer.\" His bedroom was clean and functional, with numerous assault weapons scat- tered around, I did not see any modern conveniences or personal effects, but Ortega seemed to be at home in his surroundings. Ortega's demeanor was that of a ma n who bad abstained from sex longer than most in bis politcal position. As he slowly unbuttoned his shirt, I noticed a Catholic medallion with the secret Jesuit ascension/descesion symbol on it, a common accessory among Jesuit spooks. He sat in wicker chair as 1 followed his silent lead in gratifying him orally. While he chain smoked cigarettes, I sat in front of him on the floor, and relayed Reagan's message to him as programmed. I began. \"President Reagan has sent me as a messenger of peace.\" He casually interrupted. slowly looking me up and down. \"I'd like to have a piece in a few more minutes.\" I continued, \"Your people have en dured many hardships Throughout their existence. He (Reagan) only wants to help. The American people want to see "},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"peace and freedom in your land.

The unified effort of Mexican-American Catholic missions is to promote peace in your region, while only enhancing your culture. The world is rapidly turning toward world peace, and Nicaragua is way behind the times—from technology and education to government ideals and religious convictions. Pope John Paul is praying diligently for peace in your regi on, and has joined forces with President Reagan, Mexico, and even the Soviet Un ion to ensure that peace. He (the Pope) knows your goals, he knows your moti ves (I leaned forward, almost whispering from my own instilled belief), he knows your soul. We can all work in tandem to achieve that peace. Nicaragua, small though it may be in relation to the rest of the world, is a significant stepping stone toward unifying world powers. It can no longer be a source of contention and disagreement. Your people must be free. Free to wo rship God through your holy Catholic church. That is first and foremost on Pr esident Reagan's agenda, as well as the Pope's and President de la Madrid's. A New World Order is coming into being with or without you; it is an inevitabl e process that cannot be stopped. A whole new world of peace awaits us all. I can see you are a peace-loving man.

Allow the church bells to ring with good news of peace, prosperity and freedom. You can achieve all of your goals for your co untry's advancement with our help.\" Ortega thoughtfully finished smoking a cigarette, and lit up another as he confidently replied, \"Tell your Presid ent that I have seen his freedom, and listened to\" his words proj ected through yet another example of it. He paints a beautiful picture suspended within his framework. A picture can appear serene to its beholder while it is being gazed upon. I cannot worship a graven image, and the picture he paints is just that. We have fought too hard and too long, spilling sweat and blood across this land in our determined effort to maintain human values instilled in us by our forefa thers, who gained their profound wis- dom from the original Catholic missionaries. These values are the same as those portrayed in President Reagan's painted picture-only ours are real. His have only surface value, like any other pa inting. If I were to concede, I would only be framed within me picture he paints, hung on his wall like a trophy. I will not mislead my people, in spite of his offers of wealth and position, I am true to my convictions, and when he is true to his, then we will meet on common ground and have something of s ubstance to discuss. For now, words are only a waste of our time.\" Ortega put out his cigarette, and pulled back the covers on his bed. \"I'll lake you somewhere pleasant.\" He took a well-used opium pipe/bong off his "},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"dresser and handed me a nozz le, I had been trained to accept any drug given to me with the only exception being the strictly forbidden marijuana. I hesitated until Ortega assured me it was opium. As the drug took affect he said, \"This could be the way to world peace.\" Sex with Ortega was at very least free of pain and perversion. Unlike most I was forced to have \"diplomatic relations\" with for the Reagan Administration, he fell asleep when he was through due to the difference between opium and cocaine. The honk of a jeep's horn outside awoke him. As I prepared to leave, he said, \"Wait\". He took a small, 1/4 inch or so ball of black opium from his personal stash, wrapped it in the cellophane from his cigarette package wrapper, and said, \"Give this to your Presiden t and tell him that you and I found more peace with this substance than he'll ev er impart on the surface of his painted globe,\" As he closed the door quietly be hind me he said, \"Come back and see me when you have more to offer. \" I was immediately returned by plane to Washington, D.C. where my \"mission\" had originated. This time I was taken directly to Bush's office, where I delivered Ortega's message verbatim. Eliminating most of the dialogue, Bush instructed me to deliver a partial message to Reagan. Unable to perceive message content and peopl e beyond my \"Need to Know\" mind- controlled limited view, I had no concept that Ortega's message would have a negative impact. It never occurred to me that Ortega had proven himself to be as much a hypocrite as he purported R eagan to be by using me as a prostitute and messenger of bad news knowing full well that I had no free will with which to make the message more palatable. Bush's revision of Ortega's message added fuei to a proverbial fire that I didn't even know was burning when I delivered the message to Reagan. Bush was with Reagan and me in R eagan's secondary office (to the Oval office) of the White House as I relayed the message as instructed, \"Daniel Ortega is a peace loving man, who seeks the same resolutions that we do. But he told me to tell you-(I dug in my purse for the opium) that he and I found more peace in this substance-(I handed the opium to Reagan) than you'll ever impart on the surface of your painted globe.\" Bush smiled as Reagan's face instantly turned beet red with rage. Bush then reacted and spun up out of his chair, look the opium for himself, and told Reagan, \"Settle down. There's more. It seems the only peace she spread was between her legs.\" He headed for the door, saying, \"I wo uld reconsider my position if 1 were in your shoes—considering what's filling hers.\" Bush dropped his gaze down the back of my legs to my shoes as he continued, \"It's running down both sides of her legs.\" Obviously I wouldn't be subjected to sex with Reagan that day. I was quickly excused and flown back to Me xico, where I resumed my NCL cruise. With my memory of the event compar tmentalized through high voltage, 1 believed at the time that I ha d never been gone at all. "},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 23 WHIRLED VISION In the fall of 1985, the same part of me that met with Ortega was walking with (Reagan appointed) CIA Director William \"Bill\" Casey through the arboured rose garden of his Long Isla nd estate. Casey began by manipulating my Jesuit/Vatican programming base personality with the expertise indicative of the current union between Catholic and CIA operations. Casey, whom Reagan referred to as a \"man of Vision, \" was forming my Jesuit mind-control programmed \"understanding\". \"I have a World Vision, 1 one of peace. By re- moving the more violent factions of societies world wide and replacing them with faithful leaders of one world government, and the one world church, global unification is eminent. It is a beautiful vision, and it came to me in my dreams. God has moved me to move men. I've moved them here and I've moved them there—now it's time to remove them. My World Vision encompasses the globe and puts to rest any and all tensions, st rife, overpopulation, and starvation. My vision is a World Vision, and the churches see it my way as evidenced by their support of the cause.\" 2 Referring to my mind-controlled in volvement in Haitian operations via NCL, Casey further defined 'the cause,' \"Your heartfelt mission in Haiti has helped in my World Vision quest for he r people to abandon hedonistic voodoo and turn their eyes to God and Godly ways. By their own design, they have created an atmosphere of evil whereby a plague will be visited on their land. The Lord has so moved me to move me n who share our goals into place, and re-move those who stand in the way of p eace. It is for this reason that your mission in Haiti must be brought to a close. Baby Doc, in his tireless devotion to saving the demonically possessed cannot bear the burden of watching his people die the wretched death unleashed upon those doomed for hell. We are left with no alternative but to heed the word of God and spare him from annihilation. For this reason, we w ill send in the missionaries (Jesuit Mercenaries) to inoculate the population with a vaccine that will spare only the good of heart by virtue of its design. All attempts to maintain Haiti within the loop of financial gain will cease. Tourism must be stopped for the sake of the innocents visiting a plagued land. Despite our differences, Baby Doc has complied with the Vatican's orders to the test of his abilities in his demon- infesled land, and must resign his post. We owe it to him to transport him to safety. It is our duty as Americans and followers of God to obey the commands of our Lord and Master and enforce the World Vision. It is your duty as an American and follower of God to instill the understanding that God has spoken, and a plague is imminent. Baby Doc is being prepared for transition and awaits word of direction. You will provide him with that word.\" With my perceptions distorted and Catholic Jesuit programmed \"understanding\" instilled, I was prepared to \"religiously accept\" any and all I was told. I believed that the revolution in Haiti was a holy war, never capable of realizing it was a test run battle for the minds in this 4th world country. The devotion I felt toward the Haitian people was more than a religious understanding of these alternately Catholic-Santeria 3 voodoo worshippers. I was actually subconsciously recognizing other to rtured mind-controlled slaves in this human created hell called Haiti. Consciously, I now know it was due in part to "},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"the visible stun gun/prod marks, plastic ever-present smiles that never quite reach their dead appearing eyes. Th e children clung to their wide-eyed mothers, as they performed their tasks in robotic servitude. I had recognized these characteristics in other slaves thr oughout the years, but never had I seen a whole country entranced. My compassion for the Haitian people penetrated into the realm of the spiritual, into a part of me that mind control and manipulation of religion could never touch, Casey and I had been walking through the garden, guarded by more armed men than the President, It wasn't that I was a threat, 1 couldn't even think to save myself. It was that Casey and his World Vision were a threat to humanity that so many guards were needed. The men appeared to be U.S. Secret Service officers according to their attire, weapons, and earphone headsets. One guard conspicuously placed his hand to his headset, listening as though it were remote control. He walked briskly over to Case y, who signaled me to leave with an escort who instantly arrived at my side awaiting instruction. \"Take her to my chambers,\" Casey told him, \"Clear her mind. I have something I need to instill,\" Robotically I followed my escort into Casey's office library. The room was barren, dark , and hot-just as described in a book I had been given to read in keeping with You Are What You Read programming. It produced a sensation of having somehow stepped into the novel Chameleon by insider William Di ehl. The mind scramble of the book and reality instantly commenced, \"It's warm in here,\" the agent said, unbuttoning my while eyelet blouse. \"Bill (Casey) likes to keep it this way in case-he (Casey) gets a chill and his blood runs cold. Chameleons 4 are naturally cold blooded. Make yourself comfortable white I turn up the heat. Mr, Casey doesn't want to hear a peep out of you, so I'll warn you now-be Silent.\" He deliberately triggered and activated the Jesuit programmed part of me that believed in my Vow of Silence. 5 The walls have ears and the plants have eyes, so your silence is tantamount to success. I ' m going to leave you to reflect in Silence, Bill will be along any minute.\" Had I been capable of \"reflecting,\" I wo uld have questioned the validity of Casey's dramatic position of \"religio us overtones\" on Haitian policy. Like Reagan's, Casey's sincerity did not ring true considering the fruits of his labor, But then, 1 could not consider any more th an I could reflect, and 1 sat in a state of what felt like suspended animation awaiting my instructions. I could not anticipate nor dread what was about to ha ppen as futuristic thinking was left in the hands of my controllers. Had I rea lized the scramble of reality with William Diehl's book, I could have \"psych icly\" predicted what happened when Bill Casey strolled in. Casey walked over to his highly polis hed, dark wood desk and opened the top drawer. Casey's desk was one of th e few furnishings in the large, airy room. The dark, polished, reddish-wood pa neling seemed even darker with the midnight blue carpeting curving slightly up the wall. Heavy, gothic maroon velvet drapes blacked out the sun from the windows behind his desk, \"I can see quite clearly that you have taken a Vow of Silence, Maintain it. Maintain it and Lisssten,\" Casey hissed, using preset triggers. He reached into the drawer and took out a foot-long, maroon box with a diamond embossed on the top. \"1 received a box, quite anonymously as I do from time to time,\" Casey said in keeping with the book scramble. \"T he box has your name on it. I expected"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"to open it and find the usual pierced chameleon and found, instead, a weapon intended for one.\" He opened the box in front of me. Insi de, laying on a bed of cotton, was an elaborate dagger with a handle of the same rose crystal from which the crucifix Byrd had presented me on \"our wedding night\" was made. My first personal meeting with Casey promised to be torturous as I recognized Byrd's participation in the grisly ordeal. 1 listened, deeply tranced, as Casey said , \"Is it a knife or a crucifix? I can't tell. Both symbolize martyrdom as far as I'm concerned. Note the rose pattern cut into the crystal. Now, I wonder who would have sent me this to give to you.\" Even under mind control I knew, as I was supposed to, that Byrd had provided him with the knife. My wors t fears were confirmed when Casey began using Byrd's hypnotic induction, \"In like a knife, sharp and clean, I'll carve out what I want.\" Casey sliced th rough the front of my bra, exposing the area between my breasts where Byrd routinely cut me with his pocketknife. He pierced into my breastbone deeply so that I believed I would split, and indeed did split off a personality fragment compartmentalizing this event. Using standard Jesuit-based infinity program, Casey instructed me and programmed me with messages that I would deliver as though my life depended on it. \"You must go to the Citadel and warn our Dominican brothers of impending doom to their neighbors in Haiti. Fr om the Dominican side (of the Haitian island) you will be flown to Port Au Prince where you will meet with Baby Doc (Duvalier) at his Palace. He is already receptive to your word, and knows that my words are your words and your word is Silence. You must tell General Cedras his Order is from The Rose.\" Case y touched the white rose in his lapel, signaling me to photographicall y record his words verbatim. When he was through programming me with his message, Casey told me, \"As quickly as you complete this mission, you must depart Haiti, never to return again.\" Casey used excessive high voltage to compartmentalize my memory. I recall being nauseated and ill from his stun gun as I departed his Long Island compound/home via ferry programmed with messages to Cedras and Babv Doc. Haiti had recently been dropped from th e NCL itinerary as a Port of Call, but the Dominican Republic side of the island remained open to tourism. When Houston and I debarked the NCL ship in Puerta Plata, we walked past a World Vision cargo ship that was being unloaded at the dock. I recall that a soft ocean breeze gently lifted the hem of my wh ite, gauzy dress as I weaved my way through the dockload of World Vision freight to a waiting automobile. Religion and politics apparently mix in the Dominican Republic as evidenced by the inseparable mixture of Catholic Missions, old forts, statues of Christopher Columbus, and Catholic Shrines. As we drove past the mountain tramway that takes tourists up and dow n to the rustic Citadel and Catholic Shrine at the top, Houston perpetuate d the \"Chameleon\" book scramble. Dually referring to Cedras and the short donke y ride from the tram to the Citadel depicted in Diehl's book, Houston threat ened to put me on the rickety tram saying, \"Some Jackass will see you at the top.\" In an area reserved for covert activities , out of view of tourists, I met with General Cedras in his Citadel office. Dr essed in the eerie, Jesuit, dark, hooded robe, Cedras completed Casey's \"Chameleon\" book scramble scenario as we walked through the ancient structure to his office. Cedras' demeanor made him "},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"appear more as a militant th an a \"spook,\" despite the corny monk's attire. With his hood down his back, Cedras' sharp, craggy features and darting steel blue eyes kept my full attention. I had seen him at a monastery in Santo Domingo as ordered before, 6 when Haiti was still being used by the CIA for Operation Watchtower to transport cocain e and Contra weapons from Cuba. Alone with Cedras and properly signal ed, I began photographically reciting Casey's message, \"I have word of warn ing from the Vatican by way of the honorable and faithful William Casey. He sends word of impending doom that is to befall your neighbors on the darkside in Haiti. Voodoo manifest itself in mysterious ways while the way of the Lord is clear. Evil must be stopped at all costs. The cost shall be in terms of huma n casualty, as a plague is being visited upon the land. Those who fornicate with devils shall be infested with the plague. Woo unto them who have stood in the path of World Peace. By God's design the New World Order shall come into being with or without the Haitians. All American operations in Haiti are now destined for your ports. Your people (the CIA-UN operated Dominicans) will fl ourish in peace and prosperity while the dark side (Haitians) drown in the bl ood of this holy war that they have brought upon themselves. Close your bord ers swiftly and maintain guardians at the gate lest the Haitians infest your land with their evil plague. Inoculation of the masses shall be masked in the body and the blood shall carry the doom. As more and more Haitians turn to God in their final hour, the communion they partake will be Satan's own. With their God as the scapegoat, your Island in the Son (sun) will be freed of the vile and wicked. I have seen a vision, a World Vision, and it is through communion with the ancients that we have been granted the Keys to the Kingdom 7 to unlock the gates of hell. The holy water sent herein has the blessings of the Vatican and must be sprinkled like rain upon the Haitians. Our God reigns, and he rain s rivers of blood upon the Haitian masses, and he reigns supreme upon your mission. Your mission is clear. You serve communion and let God son them out. Those who serve the body of Christ are covered by the Vatican, those who serve voodoo evil shall be covered in the blood of their own. It is clear our God reigns. Lei the games begin.\" Combining the cryptic language of Cedras' CIA and Jesuit operations, Casey had weaved numerous cryptic comm ands into his message. Had I been inadvertently accessed, the instructions would make little sense to those not cued to the language. Cedras was listening religiously, fully grasping the magnitude of Casey's instructions. I concluded the message, \"The holy water with the Vatican's blessings will arrive at 1 PM today by way of World Vision, The blood shall host the plague.\" 8 I was relieved to depart Cedras' pres ence without being subjected to his usual perverse sexual brutality. This would be someone else's job this time, as my programmed trance was maintained until I delivered Casey's message to Baby Doc Duvalier on the \"dark side\" of the \"Island in the Son\". Houston took me to the small CIA-ope rated airport at the foot of the mountain where I boarded a small, white airplane destined for Port Au Prince, Haiti. When we landed, the pilot walked me over to Baby Doc's Tonton guards, and ordered that I be taken to the Palace. He spoke in rapid Haitian French, and lifted my symbolic, rosy cross necklace for emphasis to the guards. Reinforcing my insLiiled belief thai th e Catholic emblem would protect me, the guards treated me with the respect that apparently was reserved for identified Jesuit spooks. I was driven by white Mercedes to the Haitian Presidential Palace. Looking even more conspicuous ly out of place in contrast to stark "},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"poverty than his fleet of Mercedes, Baby Doc's Palace was decadent. I stood reverently in. the foyer waiting for my arranged meeting to begin, unable to question Baby Doc's luxurious surroundin gs in view of the despair and starvation around him. I had met with Baby Doc throughout the early '80s in the capacity of a Project Monarch prostitute. All Haitian-based U.S. covert operations were run by a bed-ridden old man referred to as \"Ol' Charlie,\" who resided at the El Presidente Hotel until his death in the mi d '80s. During my tenure as a mind- controlled messenger and prostitute in Haiti, I had been forced to attend a voodoo ceremony for my (and others') traumatization purposes. I was ordered to perform oral sex on Baby Doc as his dark-windowed Mercedes slowly proceeded through the crowds of Haitians on their way to the ritual. With my Haitian missions previously established with Ol' Charlie for business and Baby Doc for prostitution, my meeting Ba by Doc for business was unprecedented. \"What brings you here?\" Baby Doc spit the words at me in English. I had been led into his library by three armed guards, \"I have no need of a Catholic whore,\" Baby Doc's applicable knowledge of the English language was limited by his intellect whereby an aide filled the need for an interpreter as 1 delivered Casey's message. \"I come in the name of peace. I have a message for you from William Casey, sanctioned by the Vatican, The Pope is in agreement with U.S. policy in Haiti. He has seen a vision, a sign from God. The vision is a World Vision, whose people are reaching out to yours with charily in abundance. The goods and services provided require only that th e people of Haiti anoint the sick, feed the hungry, and clothe the poor through his servants of World Vision. Their mission will separate good seed from ba d and restore peace in your region. The peace that shall be visited upon your la nd amongst your people is imminent, but not before the rivers run red with the blood of the wicked. The vision is plague, and your people will fall in the streets pleading for mercy, and you will not be here to hear it. The lime has come for you to leave. It is God's will that you escape the plague with blessings from the Vatican, never to return to your homeland. Prepare for your exodus today for tomorrow holds a promise of doom. Using your prophetic wisdom, wa rn the masses of impending doom and arm them with World Vision. The vision is one of peace' for those who flock to the tents and churches for salvation. Your destiny is clear, and the Vatican has cleared the way for your departure.\" With Casey's message delivered, Baby Doc's Tontons returned me to the same airplane I had left a short time before . I flew in silence, unable to think to comprehend the magnitude of what had just transpired. Events to a mind- controlled slave are all perceived as fi rst and last times. Therefore, Casey's instructions that I would \"depart Haiti, never to return again\" seemed business as usual to me. Flying over the mount ains that separate Haiti from the Dominican Republic, I noticed the gentle people below bathing in the waterfalls, toilessly washing their bright clothes on the rocks, and primitively hauling goods in the baskets balanced on their heads. An occasional goat ran across the barren land, and the children, bellies swollen from starvation, played with slicks and vines. With my mind-controlled and spinning with misperceptions, my whirled vision, like Ortega's rose colored glasses, prevented me from seeing the reality of New World Orders. "},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"1 World Vision was/is a Jesuit controlled organiza tion that led churches to give them money under the guise of spreading world peace. What they were not saying was what the money was actually funding-a world peace plan under mind control. 2 Perceptual distortions of the virtues that good people hold most dear is one reason for the proliferation of criminal activity within such organizations as World Vision. There are those within affected factions of such organizations, the Catholic church, and even the U.S. Government that operate under distorted percep tions referred to by the CIA as a \"Need to Know\" basis--and they \"Need to Know\" that thei r minds, religion, and/or perceptions are being deliberately manipulated. 3 Since the Catholics had joined forces with the United Nations to overtake the world through mass mind control, the Jesuit influence on Haiti was complete. By maintaining much of the ceremony, placing literal in terpretation on \"eating the body a nd drinking the blood,\" and providing a mirror reversal of good and evil, Catholicism and voodoo, like Catholicism and the United nations, beca me one in the same. 4 The term \"Chameleon\" is a term used to descri be spies who are expertly trained to blend into any environment at any ti me unnoticed-just as an MPD mirrors the one they're with. 5 The Jesuit Vow of Silence wa s installed through the Rite to Remain Silent of my childhood. Now I know, like so many others in Intelligence, that \"Silence Equals Death\". Knowledge is our ONLY defense against mind control. 6 Byrd had told me that Cedras was \"a strategica lly placed chess piece that the CIA, Jesuits and U.N. moved around\" to usher in their New World Order, 7 \"Keys to the Kingdom\" was defined by Bill Bennett in accordance with Jesuit programming as follows: \"At the onset of Christianity, the Apostles compiled all the information that they ha d obtained from Christ and built the Holy Catholic Apostolic Church. Christ intended it to be the one world church then —the truth, the light, and the way. The secrets were kept in the ark of the covenant, and passed down gene ration after generation. And generation after generation Christ caused for more to be written-the fruits of his labors expounding on the truth. Now the ark has become archives—a we alth of information. This information is accessible to very few— the very few who hold the Keys to the Kingdom\". 8 Interpretation of the final mess age is left to the minds of the masses who can still discern truth. My conclusions are \"cl ear\", bused on conversations over heard and my experience as a White House sex slave. Although Byrd and R eagan, among others, had prostituted me to officials in AIDS-infected countries, they used no protection against \"the plague\" when having sex with me. 9 There can be no world peace without peace-of-m ind, and there is no peace-of-mind under mind control. Haiti, once a prototype of New Worl d Order controls has now been used up and discarded by the CIA and Jesuits. U.N. \"pea cekeeping forces\" have created a smoke and mirrors illusion of \"p eace\" by keeping it FR OM the Haitian people. "},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24 A-HUNTING WE WILL GO On December 4, 1986, I turned 29 years old. Usually mind-controlled slaves were discarded, \"thrown from the Freedom train,\" at 30; but I argued with Houston when he told me my government abusers only had one year left to \"use me up\". I had had no conscious awareness of the passing of time, and believed I was still only 24. Regardless of what I believed, my abusers did their best to \"use me up\" physically and psychologically before even a month had passed. I was in Washington, D.C. on a routine trip, which included being prostituted to President Reagan. \"Uncle Ronnie's\" cheeks were flushed from excitement and cognac as he told me, \"I always take two weeks off for Christmas to go back to California.\" Reagan interrupted himself to break into an old Hollywood style song and dance, \"California here 1 come...\" The While House, he claimed, had always been confining to him, and he appeared genuinely excited about his upcoming trip . \"I look forward lo this trip every year because I get to see old friends. Oh, I still work while I ' m there-the President's work is never done-but at least I 'm there. It's about time you see where I call home.\" Then, quoting the Wizard of Oz, he said, \"'There's no place like home.' And you're about to see why. Say it with me, \"There's no place like home. There's no place like home'.\" Then he instructed me in Oz cryptic, \"Click your heels. There's no place like home.\" Blue-white light seemingly exploded in my brain, like being hit with deadly low voltage AC electrical current. Reagan was \"setting the stage\" for an attempted mind scrambling time slip, to be reactivated at an upcoming meeting I would have with him in Bel Air, California. The motor home was packed to the walls, and the walls were packed with cocaine as Houston, Kelly, and I depa rted on our long drive to California. Houston had planned several \"tourist stops\" along the way that proved as\" nightmarish as the California ordeal itself. In Las Vegas, Nevada, Houston kept Kelly and me busy prostituting us to everyone he knew \"in the know\" and in attendance at the Country Music Association's annual convention. Weary of being sent from room to room, 1 was back in the lobby literally trying to catch my breath when I saw Michael Dante. He was dressed in an expensive, light grey silk suit and dark glasses, looking more like a Fed than a mobster, leaning on a post, waiting for met \"Our love\" he professed over the phone for mind conditioning purposes was certainly not apparent now. \"You're late ,\" he growled as he looked at his watch. He ordered me into the Ladi es' Room to activate programming by having me \"lose myself in the infinity mirrors that lined the walls. With my mind set like he wanted, he then us ed and directed me in commercial pornography. Later, he did the same with Kelly. At the Grand Canyon, Houston traumatized Kelly and me in preparation for. the upcoming events in California. While hiking down the canyon, Houston attempted to anchor hypnotically all of the trip's events behind the death and insanity programming to which he was subjecting us. When we stopped for a late afternoon lunch in the Canyon, Kelly collapsed in a state of shock, unable to eat. Houston was pleased because he \"got to eat it all himself\". I was, as "},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"usual, undergoing the food and water deprivation. I was so thirsty, I could not think to eat. Kelly's condition magnified my own terrified state, and I did all I could to keep Houston from supposedly pushing her over the edge. I carried her for hours all the way out of the cany on, without pausing to rest. In my own mind I wanted to believe I was actually able to protect her. The fact was, Houston was wearing me down physically to ensure that I could not protect her at our next destination: Lake/Mount Shasta, California. George Bush was highly active in bo th the Lampe, Missouri and Shasta, California retreat compounds. Just like Lampe, Shasta's cover was country music. According to everyone 1 knew, singer and songwriter Merle Haggard supposedly ran the show at Lake Shasta, diverting any and all attention from the nearby Mount Shasta compound. Shasta was the largest, covert mind-control slave camp of which I am aware. Hidden in the wooded hills, military fencing corrals an enormous fleet of unmarked, black helicopters and more mind- controlled, military robots than I saw in all of Haiti. This covert military operation served its own agen da, not America's. I was told and overheard that it was a base for the future Multi-Juri sdictional Police Force; for enforcing order and law in the New World Order. In the center of the high security compound, was another well-guarded mili tary-fenced area that was regarded as a \"Camp David\" of sorts for those running our country. George Bush and Dick Cheney shared an office th ere, and claimed the outer perimeter woods as their own hunting ground where they played \"A Most Dangerous Game\". Predicated on conversations I overheard between the tw o, it was this world police military background that earned Dick Cheney his cabinet appointment as Secretary of Defense 1 with the Bush Administration. Houston stayed at Haggard's Lake Sh asta resort while Kelly and 1 were helicoptered to Mount Shasta for our scheduled meeting with Bush and Cheney. The helicopter pilot directed our atten tion to the military fencing surrounding the outer perimeter of the compound. Rarely did pilots ever speak to either of us, but this one smiled wickedly as he told us we would need to know the outer limits for A Most Dangerous Game. As soon as we arrived at Bush and Cheney's inner sanctum, I noticed George Bush, Jr. was with them. It was my experience that Jr. stood by his father and covered his backside whenever Bush would become incapacitated from drugs or required criminal backup. It appeared that Jr. was there to serve both purposes while his father an d Cheney enjoyed their work-vacation. Hyper from drugs, Cheney and Bush we re eager to hunt their human prey in \"A Most Dangerous Game\". They greeted me with the rules of the game, ordered me to strip naked despite the co ld December winds, and told me in Oz cryptic to \"beware of the lions and tig ers and bears\". Kelly's life became the stakes, as usual, which resurrected my natural and exaggerated programmed maternal instincts. Tears silently ran do wn my cheeks as Bush told me, \"If we catch you, Kelly's mine. So run, run as fast as you can. I'll get you and your little girl, too, because I can, I can, I can. And I will.\" Cheney, daring me to respond, asked, \"Any questions?\" I said, \"There's no place to run because there's a fe nce—the kind I can't get over. I saw it\" Rather than physically assault me. Cheney laughed at my sense of \"no where to run, no where to hide and explained th at a bear had torn a hole in the fence somewhere, and all I had to do is find it. He lowered his rifle to my head and said, \"Let the games begin. Go.\" "},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Wearing only my tennis shoes, I ran through the trees as fast and as far as I could, which wasn't very far at all. Bush was using his bird dog to track me, the same one that had recently been used with me in bestiality filming as a \"Byrd-dog\" joke on my owner, Robert C. Byrd. When caught, Cheney held his gun to my head again as he stood over me, looking warm in his sheepskin coat. Bush ordered me to take his dog sexual ly while they watched, then he and Cheney ushered me back to their cabin. I pulled on my clothes and sat in th e office part of the cabin awaiting instructions. I had no idea where Kelly was, nor do I in retrospect. Bush and Cheney were still in their hunting clothes when the programming session began. Bush said, \"You and I are about to embark on A Most Dangerous Game of diplomatic relations. This is my game. You will follow my rules. 1 will have the distinct advantage of hunting you wi th my Eye in the Sky (satellite). I'll watch every move you make. As long as you play the game by my rules and make no mistakes, you live. One mistake and I ' l l get you, my pretty, and your little girl, too. You die, and Kelly will have to play with me. I prefer it that way. Then it will be her Most Danger ous Game. The cards are stacked in my favor because, well, it is my game! Are you game?\" There was no choice. I responded as conditioned, \"Yes, Sir! I'm game.\" The parallels to The Most Dangerous Game that had just occurred in the woods were deliberate and intended to make retrieval of memory \"impossible\" due to cryptoamnesia scrambling. \"Good. Then let the games begin. Listen carefully to your instructions. You have no room for error.\" Cheney flipped his \"game timer\"—an hourglass. Bush continued, \"This game is called the King and Eye, and here's the deal. You will be establishing stronger diplomatic relations according to order between Mexico, the U.S., and the Midd le East. Your role will require a change of face at each new place. I'll chart your course, define your role, and pull your strings. You'll speak my word s when I pull your strings. There is no room for error,\" Cheney was half lying across the plai n, military issue style desk in an apparent drug stupor as Bush talked. Still wearing his hunting coat and hat, Cheney aimed his rifle at me from the desk and threatened, \"Or a-hunting we will go.\" Bush finished Cheney's thr eat by singing, \"We'll catch a fox and put her in a box and lower her in a hole.\" Bush looked at Cheney and burst out laughing. The sight of him dressed in his hunting clothes with a huge bore, do uble-barreled shotgun to his shoulder inspired Bush to tell him he \"looked tike Elmer Fudd\". Cheney, imitating the cartoon character, said, \"Where is that waskily wabbit?\" Operation The King and Eye would invol ve Reagan's #1 envoy Philip Habib (who cryptically played the Alice In W onderland role of the White Rabbit with slaves such as myself) a nd Saudi Arabian King Fahd. So when Bush referred to the two as \"Elmer Fahd and the Wa skily Wabbit,\" he and Cheney laughed until they cried. Since both were already high from drugs anyway, they had a great deal of difficulty maintaining composure long enough to complete my programming. 1 Dick Cheney has no official U. S. military history to justif y his position as our nation's former Defense Secretary under President George Bush. "},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25 BUSH BABY It was late evening when Bush and Cheney finished programming me with numerous messages pertaining to the immediate opening of the Juarez, Mexican border to free (drug and slave) trade. They then took me downstairs to the living quarters of the western cedar and redwood structure where Kelly soon joined us. George Bush, Jr. deposited my obviously traumatized and withdrawn child at the door. Referring to The Most Dangerous Game she told me in a quiet, defeated and sad voice, \"I was caught same as you\". In retrospect, I do not know if she was actually hunted (I can only hope she was not). Regardless, this reinforced the fact that 1 had been caught and therefore was \"responsible\" (when in fact I was not) for everything that happened to Kelly from that point on. The decor of the residence area reflected Cheney's primitive, rustic, western preference. Like his \"ultra secret\" Pentagon Bunkhouse, use of leather was in abundance. The main room was small, but appeared larger due to an infinity mirror on one wall. The room was decorated in mirror fashion with one side looking like the other. Centered betwee n two facing black leather sofas was a coffee table littered with drugs and paraphernalia. Bush and Cheney were sitting in matching black leather recl iners angled towards the large stone fireplace where a fire was blazing, illuminating and heating the room. Heroin, Bush's drug of choice, was in abundance and Cheney joined him in using it. The smorgasbord of drugs la id out supposedly included opium, cocaine, and Wonderland Wafers (MDMHA-XTC aka ecstasy), which indicated to me they intended to celebrate th eir vacation with abandon. 1 had seen Cheney stumbling drunk before, but this was the only time I saw him use heroin and give it to me. Kelly, too, was subjected to the drugs. Bush attempted to sell Cheney on the idea of pedophilia through graphic descriptions of having sex with Kelly. Bo th were already sexually aroused from drugs and anticipation. Cheney demonstrat ed to Bush why he did not have sex with kids by exposing himself to Kell y and saying, \"Come here\". Upon seeing Cheney's unusually large penis, Kelly r eeled back in horror and cried, \"No!\" which made them both laugh. Bush asked Cheney for his liquid cocaine atomizer as he got up to take Kelly to the bedroom. When Cheney remarked how benevolent it was of Bush to numb her with it before sex, Bush replied, \"The hell it is. It's for me.\" He described his excited state in typical vulgar terms and explained that he wanted it to spray cocaine on his penis to last longer. Cheney said, \"I thought it was for the kid.\" Bush explained, \"Half the fun is ha ving them squirm.\" He took Kelly's hand and led her off to the bedroom. Cheney told me that since I was \"responsible\" for Bush's assault on my daughter by being caught in A Most Dange rous Game, I would \"burn\" (in hell). He burned my inner thigh with the fi replace poker, and threatened to throw Kelly in the fire. He hypnotically enhanc ed his description of her burning to traumatize me deeply. As he sexually br utalized me, I heard Kelly's whimpers coming from the bedroom. As her cries grew louder, Cheney turned on classical music to drown out her cries for help. "},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"At 4:00 am, as ordered, Bush Jr. (and his helicopter pilot) came to retrieve Kelly and me. We were flown (by helic opter) back to the Lake Shasta area where Houston and the motor home awaited us. Bush's assault of Kelly proved to be a mind shattering e xperience for me, and physical ly devastating to Kelly. She was in dire need of medical attention and was unable even to move. Houston threatened to stop the motor home in the Yosemite area and throw me from a steep cliff if I didn't settle down . His threats and commands could not control my hysteria, as much of his control programming had inadvertently shattered. Fearful he would lose both his \"money-makers,\" Houston permitted me to telephone Kelly's doctor and begin administering medicines. As for me, he arranged for assistance in picking up the pieces in order that I complete my primary purpose in traveling to California, i.e., meet with Mexican President Miguel de Ja Madrid and finalize plans Co open the Juarez border. "},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26 NEW WORLD ORDERS There was \"no time to lose\" in bringi ng me back around to a functioning level. I knew I had work to do. Although I was to be \"used up\" by my 30th birthday, I do not believe it was Bush and Cheney's intention to expedite the process so quickly. Apparently it was their incompetence due to over- indulgence of drugs and subsequent ab use of Kelly in my presence that destroyed parts of my maternal-bas ed programming. Regardless of their \"excuse,\" Houston drove us to San Franci sco, California where Temple of Set (Satan) founder U.S. Army Lt. Col. Aquino made some emergency \"repairs\". I was not taken to a hospital or a mental institution, but to a brain/mind research and development lab on the U.S. Army Reservation at Presidio. There are many facilities such as this one acro ss the country at vari ous CIA, military, and NASA compounds where hyper-advanced government knowledge is put to the test, developed and modified. Those I met who had expertly learned the scientific mechanics of the brain in conjunction with the ins and outs of the mind used their gained secret knowledge to manipulate and/or control others. The only thing Mark Phillips, Byrd, a nd Aquino had in common was the belief that \"secret knowledge equals power\". 1 Byrd explained to me that New World Order \"powers were strengthened\" by allowing the mental health community only partial and/or deliberate misinf ormation through their organization lobby, The American Psychiatric Association (APA), concerning treatment modalities for severe dissociative disorders bein g created through mind control! Per- petrators believed that withholding knowledge and the proliferation of deliberate misinformation allowed them control over their secrets, and subsequently over humanity. They may be correct if no on e can or will react to the information presented in this book. Intended or not, I overheard a conversa tion pertaining to death and the mind between Aquino and a lab assistant as I lay on a cold, metal table in a deep hypnotic state, Aquino was saying that 1 had come close to death numerous limes which \"increased my ability to enter other (mind) dimensions en route to death\". I had listened to Aquino talk at length about such concepts before, as though he were trying to convince himself of some interdimensional time travel theory. \"Whether in principle or in theory, the results are the same,\" he claimed. \"The concept of time is abstr act in itself.\" Hypnotic talk of past- present-future set my mind in a spin that, when combined with Alice In Wonderland/NASA mirror world concepts, created an illusion of timeless dimensions. I now know that the only \"dimensions' I experienced were elaborate memory compartmentalizations of real, earthly events by real, earthly criminals, and certainly not by aliens, Satan, or demons. After moving me from the table to an elaborate box, Aquino then shifted my mind to another area of my brain, clai ming to have taken me into another dimension by way of \"death's door\". This was accomplished while I was subjected to sensory deprivation combined with hypnotic and harmonic re- programming. The seemingly coffin-like structure was transformed in my mind to a crematorium, where 1 endured the se nse of increasing heat while \"I slowly burned\" through hypnotic suggestion. Aq uino then \"pulled me through death's door\" and into another dimension, \"voi d of time\". Parts of my programming "},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"were \"recreated for the recreation of world leaders,\" i.e., U.S. President Reagan, Mexican President de la Madrid, and Saudi Arabian King Fahd. In my next recollection of awareness, Houston, Kelly, and I were in Hollywood, where Houston claimed the motor home \"broke down\"—an over used attempted memory scramble. He sent me down the street to telephone Michael Dante, who lived nearby in Be verly Hills. Dante was expecting Kelly and me to join him in his Beverly Hills mansion for several days as bad been previously arranged by our handler, Alex Houston. Kelly and I waited at the phone booth as instructed until Dante arrive d to pick us up in his midnight blue Ferrari. As soon as I sat down, Dante said, \"I got something for you, Baby, Give me your arm.\" Heroin was a common \"vice\" he shared with Bush, and he shot me up with the drug right in front of Kelly. Later that evening at his house, Dante told me that he refused to \"handle damaged goods,\" and that he would not be my next handler as previously planned. Not only was I \"not fit to live with\" him, but I was not \"fit to live\" at all. I am not certain what he meant to accomplish by these threats, but I know in retrospect that this was not his deci sion to make. Besides, 1 never perceived existence with him and his professed \"love\" as a \"future\" anyway- Instead, he said he would go along with the original plan long enough to acquire Kelly\". The next day, hours before I was to m eet with de la Madrid, L.A, Dodgers baseball team manager Tommy LaSorda, George Bush, Jr., and star pitcher of Jr.'s Texas Rangers, Nolan Ryan (who was also a banker) were at Dante's house working out the details of money la undering and bank transactions for the imminent opening of the Juarez border cocaine, heroin, and white slavery route. The common bond of covert criminal activity overrode any professional baseball conflicts between them. All three were in town to be in attendance at various gatherings and parties of Reagan's, who would be arriving in a matter of days. And all three appeared to have an understanding of my function as Reagan's \"Presidential Model\" mind-control sex slave. Dante was gathering the necessary clothes and props for the evening rendezvous with de la Madrid. LaSorda, Nolan Ryan, and Jr. were standing in the entrance way of Dante's house attempting to activate my \"Baseball Mind Computer\" programmed personality fragm ent that had inadvertently been shattered by Bush and Cheney's trauma s at Shasta. Dante told them, \"She knows more about baseball than you a nd Tommy (LaSorda) put together. Go ahead and ask her something. Anything.\" Much to LaSorda's amusement, Nolan Ryan asked, \"How many times does Fernando Valenzuela (Dodger pitcher) touch his hat if he's going to throw a srewgy (screw ball)?\" I could not re spond, although I had once known more statistical data than would ever be in print, Jr. hollered, \"Hey, Dante\". What's with your baseball computer here, huh? Are we supposed to say a magic word?\" \"I don't know,\" Dante responded. \"Could be drugs. Her sex is working fine, though. Give it a whirl.\" Jr. declined, saying, \"No thanks. Th e Baseball Computer sucks enough. Listen, we'll see you later.\" Jr. had ne ver shown any interest in me sexually. Like his father, he had only shown sexual interest in Kelly, who had been away with him most of the day. As he turned to leave, he stroked me under the chin and cryptically said, \"Have a Ball tonight\". "},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"LaSorda, who had not been on his Ultr a Slim Fast-sponsored diet yet, said, \"Speaking of balls, mine could use a little attention here.\" He unzipped his pants. Dante told me, \"We gotta get dressed. Three minutes.\" Three minutes was a trigger for me to perform a specific , oral sex act. I knelt on the floor and pushed up LaSorda's enormous belly, restin g it on my head as I groped for his penis as ordered. Dante's two Great Dane s came in as Jr. and Nolan Ryan left I had been forced to participate in a best iality film with these sex-trained dogs earlier that day, and I ha d to fight them off as I sexually gratified LaSorda before getting ready for \"the Ball\". 1 Mark Phillips explained to me that, by re vealing their \"secrets\" their power would diminish. \"Good always prevails through pos itive application, whereas the bad guys are hindered and slowed in their criminal ende avors through having to cover-up their negative actions with lies to support lies. This inevit ably allows the truth to emerge,\" Mark said.

Dante had be en bragging about his \"second home in Malibu\" ever since I first met him, a nd the place was opulence personified. I do not know who actually owned \"his\" s econd home in Malibu, California, but Reagan's influence was evident in the decor. From the front, the white stucco house gave the illusion of being two-story. The view overlooked a secluded Pacific bay, and revealed three levels built into a cliff. Through the smoked glass wall panels that spanned the back, the three stories, lavishly carpeted in red, white, and blue provided a patriotic view. All levels had a beige-white interior decorated in gold and crystal. An enormous chandelier hung from the \"cathedral ceiling, illuminating all thr ee levels at once from the greatroom which overlooked the bay. I was told that Uncle Ronnie (Reagan) would be arriving the next day. It was my \"patriotic duty\" to attend de la Madrid's welcome party and \"wear down any resistance he may have\" in order that Reagan's business meeting with him would \"go smoothly\". This was not the first time I heard this excuse for being politically prostituted, nor would it be the last. In reality, I was to do the initial dirty work, delivering messages, and encourage de la Madrid lo use drugs and party with abandon. The diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Mexico were already strong, but th is phase of the operation requited total commitment from de la Madrid. Dante and I waited at the top of the staircase as de la Madrid, accompanied by two bodyguards, climbed to the red level of the house. I greeted de la Madrid, \"Welcome to the U.S. and (seductively) welcome to the Hotel California.\" His deep-throated laugh indicated he had been cued to the ramifications of my cryptic statement. \"Hotel California,\" taken from a popular song by the Eagles, stated \"you can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave.\" To de la Madrid this confirmed the permanency of his involvement in the criminal, covert ope rations in which he was conspiring. Blackmail was openly initiated to ensu re that each criminal participant understood that if one fell, they all fell. Maintaining \"dirt\" on each other through th i s Mafia-style method was seemingly the only way these criminals implementing the New World Order kept each other \"honest.\" De la Madrid and I went into a ne arby bedroom, followed by Dante and the bodyguards. Dante then activated the programmed message instilled at the Shasta resort from Bush to de la Madrid . I recited, \"If you pl ease, Sir, I have a message to deliver to you from the Vi ce President of the United States. Welcome to our Neighborhood. As you k now, Salinas and 1 have worked out the details towards implementing our pl an to open the Juarez border tomorrow. In preparation and celebration of this accomplishment, this little party tonight will bring you face to face with a trusted few who are integral parts of this endeavor, and give you the latitude to see firsthand the friendship and honor "},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"among the (government-involved Mafioso) family members, I regret that I could not be here in person to greet you, but Ron (Reagan) can show you the ins and outs of the organization better than I. The transaction numbers have been recorded, and are available to you for cross reference purposes and to uphold the integrity of the players invol ved on your end of the Juarez border. Your commitment today ensures you of a higher economic standard of living for your people, increased relations with the U.S., an influx of American industry, and a position of high esteem in the New World Order, With your 'Seal of Approval' we can dissolve the Juarez border and make way for a future of prosperity for Mexico. For now, relax and enjoy your stay.\" One of de la Madrid's guards was shuffling through some papers from a briefcase, and he told Dante he would like the bank transaction numbers. Dante switched me to \"You Are What Y ou Read\" Passbook programming, and I delivered the numbers intended for the border guards to de la Madrid as ordered. A computer of sorts was used to calculate and confirm the numbers. Aware that the meeting was being filmed by one of Dante's high tech \"hidden\" cameras, de la Madrid held up a paper-wrapped ball of Mexican heroin. Speaking directly at the camera, he clever ly said, \"A token of appreciation, Mr. Bush, Something for your private stock. The finest heroin available. Enjoy.\" Dante strode across the room and said, \"I'll take that and see to it that he gets it myself.\" \"I'm sure you will,\" de la Madrid la ughed. He then put all but one paper back in the briefcase. I was instruct ed to present the elaborately embossed Mexican Presidential Seal (of Approval) to pre-appointed Juarez border guards as proof of de la Madrid's commitment, then deliver it directly to Bush for his file on the future NAFTA agreement. Prepared to present a modified Hands -On Mind-Control Demonstration to de la Madrid, Dante said, \"You've hear d from a Carrier Pigeon (messenger). You've seen her in a mode to accep t program. And now I will demonstrate some of her sexual modes.\" \"That will not be necessary,\" de la Madr id told him. \"I have been given a handful of keys that I would like to use on my own, including the one to destroy all memory. Not that it matters when we are monitored (he gestured toward the camera), but nevertheless I was instruct ed to do it.\" Dante did not seem to know this was not the first time I was sexually prostituted to the Mexican President. \"She rides a horse well,\" Dante said, re ferring to both the rare practice of heroin to supposedly block my memory of this event, and a Reagan-inspired sex act. Dante stuck a needle in my ar m. \"May I recommend a ride for you?\" \"I am on one now that I would like to maintain,\" de la Madrid answered, referring to cocaine use and his running nose. Dante laid out several generous lines of the white drug on a black mi rror. He stroked me under my chin triggering Reagan's sex Kitten personality, picked up Bush's heroin, and ushered the two guards out the door. De la Madrid, fully aware of my pornography exposure, said, \"You like cameras? Let's give them something to watch.\" He snorted two more lines of coke, undressed, and further activated my sex programming with the verbal and physical keys and triggers Reagan had previously provided him. At one point he enthusiastically commented that \"if I have my way, the Free Trade Agreement will include a few top of the tin e (he snorted another line of coke for emphasis) \"models\" (vaginally) carved and trained like you.\" De la Madrid had "},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"long been obsessively fascinated with my vaginal mutilation carving.

He reiterated his desire the next day during a meeting with Reagan. "},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 28 \"FREE TRADE\" OF DRUGS AND SLAVES AT THE JUAREZ BORDER The next day. Dante drove me to a Bel Aire mansion high on a hill where another party was underway. As I joined those who had gathered on the manicured lawn, I recognized many of the same Mafia people who had been at the Malibu retreat aka \"Hotel California\". This was a welcome party for President Reagan who had just arrived. He was walking across the yard toward me with his friend. Jack Valenti, who was the president of the powerful Motion Picture Association of America. Reagan looked h i s role amongst his mobster friends, his beige coal with fur collar draped over his shoulders revealing a dark grey, pinstripe suit underneath. In retrospect I remember him as dressed like the one mobster I did not have to meet , John Gotti. As soon as my eyes met his, 1 was knocked to the ground by a fa miliar blue-white blast (high voltage) like the one I had recently experienced in D.C. When I came back around and my eyes refocused, Dante was holding me up. Reagan said, \"Well, hello Kitten\". \"Uncle Ronnie, how'd you get here?\" I asked in child-like innocence. \"The rainbow, Kitten, the rainbow,\" he answered in Oz cryptic, \"I told you I was coming home. There's no place like home, and you said it with me. So, here we are. I keep a little piece of th e rainbow in my pocket so I can get back over it (to D.C.) anytime I want to. I make a wish, and click my heels, and I'm gone.\" For the moment, Reagan succeeded in confusing my mind with Oz cryptic metaphors, reconfirming to my child personality that he was indeed the powerful Wizard. As we went inside for a brief meeting, my personality was deliberately switched to th e one that had dealt with de la Madrid the night before. The grey-white stucco house was deco rated in plush Presidential blue carpeting and deep, cherry wood tones. The \"office\" was small and further crowded by those of us present for the m eeting. De la Madrid was comfortably seated, as was Jack Valenti. I was not privy to Valenti's exact role in opening the Juarez border, I only know that he was well educated lo the particulars of this meeting. Dante and I remained standing since we would be leaving as quickly as I heard what Reagan, who was shuttling papers and pacing the room, had to say. \"Well, Kitten,\" Reagan said to me, \"this is your death sentence: You'll go out ia a blaze of glory.\" I was not su rprised to receive confirmation of my imminent death by Reagan. I had heard about death by fire from seemingly everyone involved in establishing \"fre e trade,\" through Mexico, of our nation's children for drags. Reagan's use of pa triotic metaphors and puns while matter- of-factly informing me he ordered my death was reflective of his often displayed lack of respect for human life. What reflected his character even more were the crimes he was involved in that prompted him to cover-up through \"sentencing- me to death. I ha d witnessed the criminal foundations of NAFTA, which in turn could threaten th e successful implementation of the New World Order should these secrets ever be revealed. Initial \"Free Trade\" including drugs and white slavery extend ed beyond the U.S./Mexican border. It "},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"routed U.S. traumatized, robotic, mind-c ontrolled children into Saudi Arabia, while building up weapon stockpiles in Nicaragua and Iraq. Although I was considered to be no threat, predicated on the (erroneous) belief that I could not be deprogrammed to regain my memory of these events, my death would provide extra insurance to those involved. I was nearly \"used up\" anyway, and recording my death via \"Snuff Film\" was agreed upon as proof to De la Madrid and other leaders at risk, that I had indeed been silenced through death, I could not think to respond to Reagan's \"death sentence\". Dante wanted to make sure I grasped the point as he gr aphically expounded, \"The next time I ignite your (sexual) flame. Baby, it wi ll consume you, body and soul. And you will burn, Baby, burn. And I'll take your ashes and scatter them to the wind. I ' m going to blow you away. On film.\" Upon hearing something cryptic to which he could relate. Valenti laughed at Dante's twist of words. Referring to the old, porn, blue pencil editing term \"Blue movies,\" he added, \"Blue blazes\". Dante laughed with him. \"We'll call it 'Who In Blue Blazes Was That?' Or, how 'bout 'Cream-Ate'?\" De la Madrid noticed Reagan was not laughing and said, \"That's like erasing a Mercedes to film a stunt,\" He leaned forward in his chair closer to Reagan, lowered his voice and said, \"It is my desire to have seven just like her roll off the assembly Line and shippe d to me prior to the agreement's completion.\" Reagan agreed, responding, \"Those (blond e-haired, blue-eyed) fine kids on the relay to Saudi Arabia are top of the line, but they don't have what she's got.\" \"Two faced Ones are hard to come by,\" de la Madrid quipped, referring to my vaginal mutilation and Presidential programming code. He cut his eyes over to me, touched himself and cryptically continued, \"—from one perspective, anyway. And I like having 'One' I can 'count on.\" Reagan chuckled while Dante shifted his feet and unfolded his arms long enough to cough-laugh. Valenti seemed to be bored of cliches or was missing many of the cryptic double meanings, but ju dging from the tone of the meeting, that was just as well. \"I'll mention it to Bobby (Byrd) and delegate your order to him,\" Reagan told his Mexican counterpart. \"It should be relatively simple to slip one in for you every few shipment s or so once the Juarez border is open to such free trade activities as planned. \" Reagan spoke as though he were dis- tracted and thinking of something else , even when he looked my direction. \"If you please, Sir,\" I began, \"I have the Presidential Seal of Approval and am prepared to fulfill my role.\" Dante looked at his watch, aware that 1 was scheduled to be at the Juarez border by the \"stroke of midnight\". Reagan walked over to see the paper I had recei ved from de la Madrid the night before. \"OK. Well, farewell. Kitten,\" Reagan said, as he kissed my cheek. He added in Oz cryptic, \"I'll see you on th e other side (of the rainbow in D.C.). Click your heels...\" My world spun black. Someone had hit me with a powerful stun gun and I was down, feeling as though Dante was half dragging me as he led me to his car, which was already idling in the circular drive. We soon pulled up to the motor home at the gas station on Hollywo od Boulevard, where he had picked Kelly and me up several days before, Kelly was already in the motor home, vomiting sick and horribly traumatized. She had been convinced by someone that I had been killed. Houston a ttempted to create a hypnotically induced "},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"\"time slip,\" acting as though I had only been gone a few minutes. We drove quickly, stopping only for fuel in order th at I be in Juarez at the appointed time. There 1 robotically presented the Presid ential Seal of Approval to the proper officials as programmed, officially ope ning the border to \"Free Trade\" of crimes against humanity. Houston and I had hurried across the Juarez border where we were met by the Mexican offici al in charge. The guard looked to be in his late 40s, with classic, rugged, Mexican features. He stood approximately 5'11\", had black hair, an unkempt moust ache, black beady eyes and a paunchy belly protruding over his short, squat legs. He spoke excitedly in Spanish, with a harsh, cold lone to his voice as he spit out the necessary words in English, \"Give me the Seal\", He snapped his fi ngers, impatiently hurrying me. He took the Presidential seal and knocked me face down on top of a small, barren metal desk while he closely inspected the document. Even Houston was unusually quiet while this particular uniformed guard paced the small tower room, sweating profusely while he talked on his walkie talkie. Finally, he accessed and verified the bank transaction codes provided through whom he said was George Bush, Jr. He concluded the encounter by taking a stun gun from his belt and jolting me with it, supposedly to erase my memory. I was nauseated and weak from high volta ge and the ordeal as Houston and I made our way back across the border. My empty stomach rolled, prompting Houston to lie, \"I told you not to drink the water\". In reality, I had had nothing to drink since the champagn e at the Hotel California, and 1 hadn't eaten in days. I was thoroughly exhausted when we r eached the motor home in El Paso, but Houston was sexually aroused from cocain e and the criminal ev ents that merged Mexico with the U.S. at the Juarez border. "},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 THE LIZARD OF AHS After the opening of the Juarez border , I was kept actively busy according to the plan to \"use me up\" before my 30th birthday death sentence. I was subjected to a brutal (near death gang ra pe) \"celebration benefit\" at an identified Masonic Lodge in Warren, Ohio to \"celebrate the free trade benefits\" gained by involved East Coast politicos. Centers such as the nearby Youngstown \"Charm School\" went into mass production of slav es to mule drugs or be part of the mind-controlled sex slave \"trance-sport operations\". Mexico was not the only country reaping the economic bene fits of criminal free trade. After Kelly's ordeal in California, Dante and Houston were criminally exploiting her for literally \"all she was worth\". Subsequently, she missed an extraordinary amount of schooling. When she was in school, she was experiencing difficulty with her peers. These factors prompted plans to send her to a local Catholic school the next year, where her unusual behavior would be overlooked and covered up, Soon thereafter, Senator Byrd came to Nashville to fiddle at the Grand Ole Opry and, as my handler. Houston, re marked, \"fiddle around with me\" at the Opryland Hotel. Byrd explained that close association with me had become volatile due to my roles in Iran-Contra and NAFTA, and therefore he would be distancing himself from me. He spent most of \"our last night together\" working on his memoirs for a voluminous book on the U.S. Constitution he was writing (now published at taxpayers' expense), wh ich focuses on his long-winded Senate (filibuster) speeches. Byrd attempted to strengthen my prog rammed \"loyalty bond\" to him to keep me quiet \"until death do us part\". He to ld me, \"If it was up to me, I would let you live\". He talked at length about ho w our time together had been infringed upon by both de la Madrid and Reagan, B itterness over their stronger controls on me was evident as he mocked their se lf appointed roles as the Wizard and Lizard of Oz. De la Madrid's fascinat ion with U.S. mind-controlled slaves reportedly inspired him to combine Bush's lizard-like alien themes and his re- puted Mayan roots/lizard man theories with Reagan's Oz themes to claim the role of Lizard of Ahs. From Byrd's ra mblings, it appeared that his mockery of their roles was due to their having decided how \"his\" slave would die, and had nothing to do with caring that I wo uld be killed. Byrd maintained his \"bonding\" programming charade all night. He played his fiddle and sang \"to : me\" in place of his usual torturous whipping and brutality. Sex was, for the first and last time, painless. Byrd had not distanced himself too fa r from me, though, where government operations were concerned. When I was \"over the rainbow\" in D.C. during the summer of '87, it was business as usua l with Byrd. I was escorted to Goddard Space Flight Center where Byrd was waiting for me in a sterile hallway near the brass-trimmed, mirrored elevators. He was loaded down with items, which he deposited on a small table as he greeted me. He picked up a NASA ID badge and clipped it on my nipple, the metal teet h biting me with th eir serrated edges. When I (softly) cried out, he said, \"Oh OK. I l l wear it,\" removed it, and clipped it on his white lab coat. He hande d me a NASA lab coat like his and a white hard bat. His hard hat sugge stively and \"humorously\" said HARD in "},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"bold red letters. My hat said NASA, in a mirror reversal of the standard bold red lettering. When I read it in a mirror, it appeared as though I were on the wrong side of the mirror and needed to step through (according to Alice In Wonderland/NASA programming). It also clearly indicared to those-in-the- know that I was under mind control. Byrd looked at his pocket watch prompting a wave of terror in me, and sa id in Wonderland cryptic, \"We're late. As the elevator drops down the rabbit hole, we'll reverse time in order to get there a few minutes early.\" Bvrd spun me around to face the elevator's mirrored doors saying, \"Look deep into the mirror and be all that you can be by becoming infinitely lost in all that you see.\" Byrd timed his hypnotic in duction so that wben he ordered. \"Step through the mirror,\" the doors opened and we stepped through. As the elevator supposedly went \"d own 99 (taken from Aquino's corny reversal of 66) levels to th e depths of hell,\" Byrd told me the Earth \"spins faster and faster at the core, causing us to spiral downward in a tornado effect.\" I dropped deeper in my hypnotic trance . The elevator doors opened to what appeared to me as an exact replica of the floor we just left. However, this floor's hallway led to a computer room and sanitized-looking lab area. Several of the scientists working there were amus ed by our hats, prompting Byrd to ham up his comedic act, Byrd ignored the fact that these NASA workers, like many others, may have deliberately stroked his entertainer's ego because they relied on his appropriations for funding, Byrd made me robotically announce to the workers, \"He's taking me to your leader.\" \"I'm the Commander, here,\" the appare nt director of the underground lab said. The workers again busied themselves as he stood, arms folded defensively across his chest, while his bespectacled intelligent eyes darted the room surveying the situation. The Commander had a few, grey strands salting his short, dark hair, yet his build was surp risingly youthful and trim for his age. He and Byrd apparently knew each other quite well. Byrd strode over to him, dragging me along. \"Tom,\" Byrd called to his 50ish 6'1\" friend. \"This is your specimen of the day that I promised I woul d deliver. I will be most interested to see what you can deliver since diplom atic relations with Mexico depends on it. Not that I want to increase any pr essure you may feel, but we need seven more just like her to stuff in the mouth of his royal Lizardry (de la Madrid) to keep him from spilling his guts on the project.\" \"It's just as well, my friend,\" th e Commander said, stroking his chin without uncrossing his arms. \"That way he can't talk without implicating himself.\" \"That's the way the Chief feels about it,\" Byrd agreed. \"He's already in deep anyway, but this order (for slaves) hits him closer to home since they'll be serving him personally.\" We walked to a clinical, sanitized area that had a maze of small rooms where I was undressed and prepped for the lab. A nurse of sorts injected me with the NASA \"Tranquility\" drug and inst ructed me to put my lab coat back on. \"Walk this way,\" she ordered as sh e led me down the hall, swinging her hips in an exaggerated manner. I i mmediately complied. The Tranquility drug had no recreational affects, but produced an attitude of peaceful compliance to all orders given. As we approached th e theater-type lab, a small group of men who would be in attendance were ta lking with Byrd and the so-called "},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Commander. They looked at us and la ughed at my literal compliance to walk like the nurse. 1 was then led by the Commander to a \"backstage\" entrance which was actually a glass-encased lab surrounded by seats in ascending rows. Scientists in NASA lab coats looked down on the lab table where I lay as the Commander wired me up to a computerized machin e. A camera was positioned high in one comer of the room, filming all that transpired. I was aware through conversations between Byrd and the Commander that de la Madrid had requested a video of the latest advancements in mind-control technique being used to create his seven slaves. In re ality, the camera was filming scientific methodisms salted with \"comic\" misin formation as a humorous \"no\" to his request. Since I was considered \"used up\" and my death was imminent, the Commander told the scientists to \"feel free to fuck the lab specimen\", \"But first,\" he said, \"before you satisfy your mental and physical curiosities sampling the President's (Reagan's) wares, we must satisfy El President's (de la Madrid's) perverse intellect with a little space humor.\" He turned to one of the technical workers and said, \"You're going to have to edit this tape for de la Madrid's benefit and take this part out while we prepare her for an 'off color' chameleon joke.\" A live lizard encased in a glass test tu be of sorts was inserted in my vagina, The camera was focused on the area whil e my legs were spread in a birthing position. Acting as though I had conceive d while having sex with de la Madrid, the Commander said, \"Now for the finish ed product, which in layman's terms equates to the reproductive offspring of a Lizard breeding machine.\" He dramatically snapped on a rubber glove and probed me as though he were giving me a gynecological exam. In fact , he was opening the trap door of the Lizard's tube to turn him out. Very sl owly, the sluggish lizard poked his head out of my vagina and crawled out onto the metal table, \"This concludes all of the experimentation demonstration of the cloning of a Presidential model,\" the Commander said, I apparently had been selected as the prototype for the seven programmed slaves de La Madrid had requested. De la Madrid was interested in NASA programmed staves that would be vaginally mutilated like I was. He was sexually obsessed with the hideous carving. 1 have no way of knowing what, if any, technological advancements were actually provided to de la Madrid via the film. I only know that deliberate misinformation tainted the methodologies depicted, and that I had never experienced programming or testing before or at the time by any such methods. This video created for \"his Royal Lizar dry\" was one of many cryptic lizard themes that NASA used in its Mexican operations. All of my programmed roles in Mexico involved the prolific, lo cal, iguana lizards. De la Madrid had relayed the \"legend of the Iguana\" to me, explaining that lizard-like Aliens had descended upon the Mayans. The Mayan pyramids, their advanced astronomical technology, including the sacrifice of virgins, was supposedly inspired by the lizard aliens. He told me that when the aliens interbred with the Mayans to produce a form of life they could inhabit, they fluctuated between a- human and Iguana appearance through chameleon-like abilities. \"A perfect vehicle for transforming into world lead ers.\" De la Madrid claimed to have Mayan/alien ancestry in his blood, whereby he transformed \"back into an Iguana at will.\" De la Madrid produced a hologram similar to the one Bush did. "},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"in his You Are What You Read initiatio n. His hologram of lizard-like tongue and eyes produced the illusion that he was transforming into an Iguana. While in Mexico, I was always ordered to wait by rocks where the abundant Iguanas sunned before being \"trance-ported\" to my scheduled meetings with \"his Royal Lizardry,\" the Lizard of Ahs. "},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"CHATTER 30 IN THE INTEREST OF TIME AND SPACE Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont), who served as vice chairman on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee in 1985-86, was a \"friend\" of Senator Byrd. Leahy's position on Byrd's Sena te Appropriations Committee, coupled with his former position in Intelligence, afforded him an inordinate amount of power and influence. While 1 had cause to have contact with Senator Leahy on numerous occasions, Kelly was apparently more familiar with him than I. This was evidenced by our meeting with him in Vermont in the late summer of 1985. Alex Houston was booked to \"enterta in\" at the State Fair in Rutland, Vermont. The entire trip proved to be a whirlwind of covert activity for me, during which time 1 obtained a packet of papers from an unidentified operative with orders to hand deliver them to Sena tor Leahy. Kelly had been kept as busy as I, since Boxcar Willie and other CIA operative pedophiles were in abundance at the fair in Leahy's home state. President Reagan had given me specif ic orders to carry out while in Vermont, which included de livering a message to \"Pat rick\" for him. He also told me, \"When you go to Vermont, be sure and go by (\"buy\") LL Bean.\" Literally interpreting what he sugges ted, I asked, \"The whole store?\" \"No,\" Reagan laughed. \"I meant st op by there. 1 didn't mean buy the whole store. I already own it. Just buy a few things, like an LL Bean Swiss Army Knife.\" 1 When Reagan said he \"already owned\" LL Bean, I thought he was referring to the amount of shopping he did there.\" He wore LL Bean shirts, sweaters, and slippers; slept on LL Bean flannel sheets in his LL Bean pajamas; and carried his \"Presidential\" black, LL Bean, Swis s Army Knife, with which he cleaned his fingernails. But I learned the real sign ificance of Reagan's statement when I \"stopped by\" the Vermont LL Bean outlet on the final day of Houston's lengthy Vermont State Fair engagement. The LL Bean outlet, located near the fop of supposedly the highest mountain in the pristine forest, appeared to be a store front for CIA covert activity. When I asked the 'clerk' assigned to Kelly and me for a black, Swiss Army Knife, his response was indicative of familiarity with government covert operations. Using the old familiar statemen t (trigger), he ordered Kelly and me to \"Walk this way,\" as he led us thro ugh a storage area and out the back door. There, a black, unmarked helicopter was waiting on a pad for us. The pilot flew us a short distance to the top of a mountain, where we landed in a clearing next to a house that appeared to have no other access. The place was run like a fortress, and two guards in suits met us as Kelly and I emerged from the helicopter. The guards escorted us into the house, keeping Kelly while I met with Senator Leahy. I walked into an office-type room that had a panoramic view of the wilderness, where Leahy was leaning agai nst a highly polished, wooden desk. He was wearing an orange flannel shirt th at lost its purpose in crispness. It was my experience that Leahy's surroundings , like his appearance, were as sanitized as possible. I delivered the documents and message as ordered. Leahy then proceeded to explain that he was aware that my death was imminent due to my groundwork "},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"participation in NAFTA, and that subseq uently Kelly would be traded to the West Coast pornography opera tion. Not only did he obviously want to join in on \"using me up\" before my 30th birthday, but he had \"tracks\" to cover-up where Kelly was concerned. Most of my traumatic encounters w ith Leahy were alien-themed, but be often relied on my Catholic upbringing to drive his points into my mind. From my perspective, Leahy was unquestionably one of the most intelligent criminals of this entire Shadow Government. His carefully contrived chameleon-like characteristics provided him the latitude of appearing to share the principals and beliefs of whomever he was masterfull y manipulating on both a national and international level. He won Reagan's re spect through their shared diplomatic ties to the Vatican, and his Irish-Catholic heritage. While he appeared publicly to oppose Byrd on Senate Appropriations issues, they actually worked together behind the scenes in their shared world dominance efforts. Again from my perspective, Leahy was a loner who had hi s own agenda and answered to no one I knew. Leahy's intelligence was often manifested to me by triple depth meaning to h i s words and actions. Everything he did was for a deeper purpose, and this trip to Vermont proved to be no different, Kelly and I had been given what felt like a sophisticated variation of Lhe NASA CIA-designer drug, Tranquility, whic h turned us into the robotic mind- controlled slaves that Senator Leahy pr eferred. As the drug was overtaking me, I attentively listened to what Leahy was saying. \"God condones that one,\" Leahy said, referring to both my role in NAFTA and his pedophile abuse of my daughter. \"Of course, God is not the one you need to be concerned with. He is a passive God, One who's passed on and lives only in a Bible. The God you need to be concerning yourself with is the all-seeing, all-knowing God. That great, big, Eye in the Sky. It sees all, records all, and transmits the informatio n right where i t ' s needed. Let me give you some sound advice-Keep your mouth shut and none of this need be known anywhere. Only your Vice President (Bus h) will know for sure, and he's been keeping secrets all his life. I'm not suggesting George Bush is God. Oh no, he is much more than that. He is a semi -God, which means he is straddling the heavenly and earthly planes in order that he take action on what he sees with his ever watchful Eye In The Sky.\" Content with his metaphorical manipulation of my literal mind, he finished, \"Now, that 's enough fore-play. Go get the kid.\" Kelly was standing quietly and robotically just outside the door with the two guards. They ushered us down the hall, through an ornately carved door, and into Leahy's bedroom. The room was hi ghly effeminate for a man, decorated in pastels, white eyelet, and huge billowy pillows. When the Senator walked in, Kelly groaned, \"Noooo, not you ag ain\", Leahy signalled Kelly with his hand, thus switching her into total silence and submission. Then, accessing specific personality fragments that previ ously recompartmentalized in my mind from Bush's and Byrd's sexual abuse of Kelly, Leahy began undressing. His pale skin looked even whiter against th e white eyelet sheets, which seemed to accentuate the perversity of his pedophile actions with my daughter that I was forced to watch. His torturous abuse complete, Leahy ordered Kelly and me to follow him downstairs to his \"torture lab\", I had seen and experienced basement \"spy conditioning\" torture chambers before both in the U.S. and Mexico, and Leahy's \"torture lab\" looked more like a NASA lab. His access to the latest ad vancements in electronic/drug mind- control technology was consistent with his ability to use it. I was immediately "},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"strapped to a cold, chrome and stainless steel table by the two guards. Leahy began reciting, \"Cross your heart and hope to die, Stick a needle in your eye\". A wirey \"needle\" was pushed slowly into my right eye while Kelly was forced to watch. This entire ordeal was directed for trauma purposes primarily at Kelly since Leahy figured I would be de ad soon anyway. \"If you holler, if you cry, Kelly will be the first to die. Pray to God and Bush will hear, because his Eye now has an ear.\" Leahy interrupted his poem to explain that 1 was now a \"computer-eyesd\" link-up to Bush's Eye in the Sky, with the needle-like \"antenna\" transmitting every word Kelly spoke. He continued wilh me, \"Each word you speak, each breath you sigh,'Your eye trance-mits to the Eye in the Sky\". Kelly believed it, which locked he r into silence. Leahy's secret was safe-for the moment. While I was literally out of my mind from intense pain, Leahy utilized the opportunity to program me with what he said was financial information to deliver to Byrd. This required no \"p ersonality\", therefore the shattered fragments Leahy had deliberately shifted me into when raping Kelly would be ideal to \"computer-eyes\" his message. He told me that my body was a conduit to link him up to the Eye in the Sky, where he was transmitting the information for storage until such time as Byrd accessed it. \"Only the tiniest little prick can access the compuLer-eyesd' storage bank,\" Leahy said, laughing at his own double meaning mockery of Byrd's penis size. This was not the first time Leahy tran sferred apparently sensitive U.S. Government intelligence informati on to Byrd through me. I had pho- tographically recorded numbers in my mind's \"computer banks\" ever since Leahy prepared me for the task some months before at White Sands Missile Base in New Mexico. It was there in the TOP SECRET mind-control area of the base that Leahy subjected me to extreme tortures and high-tech programming. Combining purposes as usual, Leahy was saying, \"Funding will continue to be approved as long as (mind- control) Projects such as this continue to receive your full attention\". I was tr eated like a lab animal with no apparent regard for whether I lived or died. I wa s put in an electrified metal walled and floored cell, referred to by some as the woodpecker grid, which provided inescapable physical torture. In spite of his tortures, intelligence, high-tech methodism, and sophisticated mind manipulations. Senator Leahy failed to cover his \"secrets\"—including his sexual abuse of Kelly. He did succeed, however, in causing Kelly and me to be hospitalized from his torturous abuses up on our return to Tennessee. I had suffered excruciating pain and irreparable damage to my right eye, while Kelly psychosomatically suffered respiratory failure due to his extreme traumas. The physical manifestations of the psyc hological devastation wreaked on us by Senator Leahy failed to raise question s from outsiders as to the cause. Equally worthy of mention, are numerous other high profile perpetrators that Kelly and I had exposure to over th e years. These indivi duals, in spite of the CIA's \"need-to-know\" M.O. of maintaining \"the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing,\" were in positions to be knowledgeable of Kelly's and my victimizations. All of them accessed our programming either for drug distribution, banking/message delivery, mind-control demonstrations, or, most often, for their perverse sexual gratification. These too numerous individuals and events are significant chapters in my life who, in the interest of time an d space, will be fu lly exposed in a forthcoming book.

According to George Bush's claims, Saudi Arabia was in essence a controlled financial arm of the United States. Saudi Arabian King Fahd and his Ambassador to the U.S., Prince Bandar, provided a front for the uncons titutional and criminal covert operations of the U.S. This included the arming of Iraq and the Nicaraguan Contras; U.S. involvement in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (B.C.C.I.) scandal; and funding of the Black Budget through purchase of our nation's children to be used as sex slaves and camel jockeys. Since the U.S. \"won\" control of the drug industries through the so-called Drug Wars, Saudi Arabia played an integral role in distribution. It was my experience that Bush's claim of having Saudi Arabian King Fahd as his puppet was, in fact, reality. It was only natural that criminal diplomatic rela tions with Mexico interface with Saudi Arabia under the circumstances. After all, King Fahd and Mexican President. Miguel de la Madrid were active members of George Bush's elite \"Neighborhood\" in the New World Order. Before I left Washington, D.C., it, was \"my duty as a (programmed) American Patriot\" to participate in initiating the King and Eye branch of Op eration Greenbacks for Wetbacks. While plans were being finalized for a clandestine 3:00 A.M. meeting at L'Enfante Hotel which I would be at tending, 1 was rushed around D.C. gathering last minute messages and inform ation. I had no choice in leaving. Kelly at Bush's Residence Office wher e Houston had dropped us off earlier in the day for my initial briefing. Congressman Guy VanderJagt was in Bush's office along with Dick Cheney when we arrived. Before taking Kelly upstairs to the residence area, VanderJagt told Bush his story about taking my virginity when I was a small child. He recomme nded Bush do the same to Kelly before someone else \"beat him to it\". Bush laughed and replied, \"What makes you think I haven't?\"\" VanderJagt look Kelly by the hand and led her upstairs while Bush and Cheney began giving me my instructio ns. Bush joked about working \"grave yard\" in the \"shadows\" for \"the White House night shift\" of the King and Eye operation. Cheney began my instructions with the usua l threat to Kelly's life, and was interrupted by a phone call orderi ng me over to the White House, The whole time 1 was gone, I experienced a sensation of panic and dread at having had to leave Kelly at Bush's. Although I could not think to reason, the Shasta experience had left me with an incompre hensible subconscious fear for Kelly's life that was compounded by Cheney's most recent threats. I was apprehensive when I was returned to Bush's house la te that evening for completion of my instructions. A party was underway, and I was dismayed to see the place so crowded yet void of children. As I made my way through the crowd, Cheney saw me and started across the room towards me, I spotted VanderJagt nearby, who had been drinking excessively, and anxiously asked him wher e Kelly was. He said, \"Upstairs sleeping, George is expe cting you\". I wanted desper ately to go to Kelly, but Cheney, who was drunk as usual, had reached me by that time. "},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"\"Walk this way,\" Cheney slurred. He imitated the Oz Scarecrow's walk as he led me through the middle of the cr owd to Bush's office. Bush was busy behind his desk, and his tension was apparent. He said, \"Phil Habib is doing a number on his highness' (Fahd's) head , I want you to do a number on his 'dick'\". \"Please,\" Dick Cheney groaned at the term. \"That means give him a Royal fucking. Wear him out. You're going on a magic carpet ride tonight, little Genie, down through the rabbit hole, through the minor and we'll meet you on the other side.\" \"Good. He'd better have a smile on his face when we walk in (to the 3:00 A.M. meeting),\" Bush told me as I went out the door. \"If you do your part right, he will.\" I was escorted to L'Enfante Hotel wh ere I was to be prostituted to King Fahd. I had been exposed to him sexually before, but this was my first time with him and his five young girls. Physical likeness characteristics strongly suggested that these Saudi Arabian girl s were his own children. Their ages ranged from approximately ten to twenty years old. Indicating Genie-in-the- Bottle programming, of which Fahd was familiar, 1 bowed and said, \"Your wish is my command\", Fahd's first wish was for information, which I told him I would deliver later at the meeting. Fahd \"disrobed\" as his girls removed my dress. Then they \"prepared\" me as ordered by \"washing me\" with their tongues, while the youngest briefly performed oral sex on him. The girls were ordered aside while I proceeded to sexually gratify Fahd according to his instruction and those I had received earlier from Cheney and Bush. When I finished doing \"my part\" in the name of \"Diplomatic Relation s,\" Habib was at the door to escort me out. I was to meet with Fahd again at 3:00 A.M. in Habib's suite. As I stepped out the door, Habib was impatiently hopping up and down like be was energized from cocaine. Using his role as White Rabbit, he said in Wonderland cryptic, \"We're late! We're late! For a very important date!\" He led me downstairs to the entrance of the hotel, where Bush and Cheney had just walked in looking ridiculously conspicuous in their trenchcoats. Bush immediately ordered Habib, \"Call in\" and gestured to the phone across 'the lobby. Habib turned and hurried for the phone. Cheney dashed up the stairs, leaving me alone with Bush. Bush said, referring to Habib, \"Don't you love to see the wabbit hop?\" When Cheney returned a moment later, my (identified) Secret Service escort led me to the boutique area of the hote l to wait while the meeting in Habib's suite got under way. 1 had endured wate r deprivation for some time, which my escort noted as we sat near a fountain . He told me his orders were, \"You can lead a whore to water, but you can't le t her drink,\" He teased me further, stating that he knew I could \"suck th e humps of a thousand camels dry.\" At last, he took me on to the meeting in Habib's room, where Bush, Cheney, Fahd, and Habib were in the midst of discussion. Bush accessed the messages and bank transaction details I was programmed with at Shasta, and ordered me to relay an account of my meeting with de la Madrid and subsequent opening of the Juarez border. The complexities of this meeting, compounded by my being privy only to certain parts, should not be documented here out of context. I do know that Bush was setting the stage for implementing the New World Order, using Mexico and Saudi Arabia's roles for cover and for further expansion of U.S. covert criminal activity. This included the arming of Iraq with weapons and chemical warfare capabilities. The "},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"message Reagan had me programmed with earlier that day was further evidence of this. I delivered Reagan's message to King Fahd as ordered: \"Greetings to King Fahd from Presiden t Reagan. The negotiations you are about to embark on are not only critical to the world peace process, but may solidify U.S.-Saudi relations beyond your wildest expectations. You have my word that what appears to be the building up of forces in Iraq is but a mirage in the whirlwind. And when this operation is completed and the dust finally settles, you will see that the sands have shifted in time, running out on our adversaries and shifting all power and c ontrol to our unified effort. United we stand to conquer all in the name of world peace and world order, and I am confident that together we can not fail. The more Saddam destroys is that much less for us to do and deal with when we implement the Order. In the meantime, we all have much to gain and not a moment to lose.\" It was raining by the time I was escort ed back to Bush's residence where Houston was waiting to take Ke lly and me back to Tennessee. 1 The Alaska state-appointed ch ild sexual abuse physician's exam and photos corroborate that, for once, Bush may have told the truth. "},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 32 A PLACE TO RUN, NO NEED TO HIDE Alex Houston had maintained his cap acitor distributing business cover throughout the years, routinely changing company names and customers. By summer's end in 1987, Houston had stumbled onto a legitimate sales inquiry from the Peoples Republic of China, Un able to profitably manage a legal business, he look on a partner whom he said checked out to have a curious but inconclusive association in U.S. Intelligence. This partner was Mark Phillips. Houston had forbid me from meeting Mark until his background check was completed and his allegiances understood. As much as he was intrigued with Mark's past, Houston was enthralled with his propensity for conducting inter- national business. In exchange for Mark's cooperation, Houston and he formed a legal corporation. Mark Phillips became President and CEO of Uniphayse. It wasn't long thereafter that he won Houston's confidence through repeated professional successes, and Hous ton permitted me to meet him. I sensed right away that Mark was very different from the other men I encountered routinely. He treated me as though I were a person, and his eyes revealed no sexual interest in me at all. Instead of discussing world domination, slavery, pornography, drugs, and genoc ide like the other men 1 knew, he introduced me to the raccoons he had years ago rescued from certain death and then tamed. I was deeply impressed with how his \"wild\" pets loved and trusted him. 1 could not think to trust, ask for help, or even question at the time what it was that made Mark different. In the fall of 1987, Kelly was enrolle d in Nashville, Tennessee's St. Pius Catholic School. Her unusual behaviors we re addressed in school counseling, but their causes and/or origins were ne ver addressed. Kelly still laughs at the absurdity of being counseled to vent her \"anger\" by scribbling the source of her anger on a piece of paper and then jump ing on it. With her \"anger\" being caused by extreme physical and psychological tortures and sexual abuse, it could not be so simplistically relieved. Houston had forbidden Kelly to display emotion, and had so conditioned her. Once, when he savagely beat her for laughing, I huddled in a corner holding he r for hours. That did not positively affect her enormous nurturing needs any more than jumping on a piece of paper. With tears streaming down her face, she opened her bedroom curtains and cried out to what she believed wa s \"Bush's Eye in the Sky\". \"Why do you hate me? Why do you hate me so much, world, when I love you? 1 want to die now. 1 can't take it any more.\" That, as evidenced by the near death asthma attack she endured, further proved that Houston's tortures were too much for a seven-year-old child to co- exist with. In retrospect, that remaini ng part of her mind that could question why her existence was too horrible to co mprehend was locked away- And so it goes in the \"life\" of a mind-controlled slave. In December 1987, my 30th birthday laun ched the final countdown to my death. Houston was in regular contact with Michael Dante (as telephone receipts prove), and arrangements were finalized for Kelly and me to be transferred to California. There, I was supposed to be burned alive in a snuff pornography film and Kelly would become the property of Dante. But first, I had orders to conclude my part in Operation Greenbacks for Wetbacks by "},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"meeting with de la Madrid. Houst on had booked a New Year's NCL cruise to Mexico for all three of us. Kelly and I were walking among the Mexican pyramid ruins in Tulum, when Houston pointed out an iguana lizard sunning itself on a rock near the parking lot. As Kelly and I a pproached the iguana, two Mexican Secret Servicemen emerged from a dark blue Me rcedes. They used the keys, codes, and triggers to our programming that ha d been provided them to hypnotically create the illusion that the iguana was trance-forming into de la Madrid. This control technique was to build an am nesic block to ensure against memory recall. In reality, we were transported by automobile to de ta Madrid's tacky museum-style house nearby. There, Kell y and I were taken into his all too familiar bedroom by a uniformed matronly woman. De la Madrid's bed was a king-size waterbed set in a darkwood canopy frame. This time the bedspread was a plush black-blood red, which de la Madrid pointed out to Kelly as he set her on the bed. It was my experience that de la Madrid's bed was in itself a NASA technology adventure. Mounted inside of the canopy was a movie screen where de la Madrid viewed porn videos and/or NASA-provide d films. From his bed I saw replicas of the NASA Goldstar multiscreen moni tors that were routinely used in \"experimental\" mind-control conditioni ng. By filming the actual NASA multiscreen grouped monitors, the resultan t video provided the illusion of seeing a Goldstar multiscreen when shown on a (s ingle) screen such as was built into de la Madrid's bed canopy. For example, once when I was in his bed, the same light blue sky with moving clouds was depicted on the monitor screens that NASA had used to lock-in my programming \"Somewhere in Time,\" de la Madrid showed on his canopy movie screen. He further enhanced the effect by having me hypnotically \"float/drift\" on hi s waterbed which he had covered with a spread of similar light blue sky with clouds print. My previous NASA programming was easily accessed \"Somewhere in Time\" through this simple, but nevertheless complex visual trigge ring method. The pornography shown was of me from previous taping, alte rnating with a built-in video camera projecting our sex acts onto th e screen as they occurred. This time de la Madrid said, \"Let us end where we began...,\" referring to my witnessing the rape of my daughter in Shasta. He ordered me to undress and recline against the headboard of his bed. At the foot of the bed, he began pulling Kelly's jeans off as he said, \"Y ou gave birth to her, just as you gave birth to the border agreement, and now your role is through on both counts. The tears she will shed as you burn cannot exti nguish the flames of passion you have passed on to her. Your intense sexuality has been regenerated in her, and this hormonal experiment in genetics will su ccessfully evolve for generations to come. Your role is complete. And tha nks to my friends in Washington, NASA has perfected the formula and given birth to the technology of mirrored procreation using recreated bloodlines. The only detectable difference makes the blood run cold. Reptil ian. See for yourself\" De la Madrid gestured up toward the canopy screen, where the NASA created video of my \"giving birth\" to the lizard was depicted. By this time, the NASA provided designer drug for mind control, \"Tranquility,\" had been administered and was kicking in full forc e. My eyes were hypnotically fixed on the video as he began performing oral sex on my daughter. She, too, was rendered helplessly defensel ess by the drug and quietl y complied with his every "},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"demand. Using specific commands, de la Ma drid ordered me to spread my legs and display the vaginal mutilation carving. He positioned himself over Kelly's face, smothering her with his penis while he performed oral sex on my carving. When at last we were returned to the NCL cruise ship, Kelly and I were vomiting sick from de la Madrid's ab use and the high voltage trauma that followed. An unusually large shipment of cocaine and heroin had been loaded, which was transferred into the walls of our custom built motor home once we docked at Key Biscayne, Florida. Houst on supposedly stayed aboard ship for the next week of his engagement, while I drove the motor home full of drugs and my sick daughter to Houston's farm where we resided in Tennessee. By the time Houston returned to Tenn essee from his NCL cruise, Ken Riley had already emptied the motor home and dispersed the drugs as previously planned. The only business Houston had to attend was implementing the final phase of trance-ferring Kelly and me to Dante and being updated on Mark Phillips' latest successes. Houston immediately began programming me to not take anything but Kelly's and my clothes when sent to Dante At the same lime, Mark Phillips and I had reached a level of communica tion that was new to me. Although I had no conscious understanding of what he was saying, the truths he spoke resounded throughout the depths of my being. For instance, when he showed me his \"Back to the Future\" Delorean spor ts car, he wisely cryptically stated, \"Sometimes you have to know where you've been in order to know where you're going.\" Just before Kelly and I were to leave for California, Mark asked me to help him force Houston out of bu siness by providing him with the files on suspected (corporate) criminal activity that Houston kept hidden at our house. Not only did 1 gladly do so, but \"somehow\" I was ab le to ask for Help in return. I asked him to help Kelly and me get away from Houston before I was killed and Kelly was sentenced to a fate worse than death. Mark assured me that he would help. The day Houston intended for Kelly and me to be transferred to Dante, I felt a strange compulsion to telephone Mark and notify him. That morning, Houston drove to Mark's office believing he was going to meet with him later that day. But Mark had brought a team of movers to the house, and rescued Kelly and me. He had brilliantly intercepte d us as we were being passed to our intended destination! Mark even understo od Kelly's and my need to rescue our farm pets from Houston's abuse. He not only found good homes for our live- stock, but he had arranged for them to be loaded and transferred during our frantic rush to move out of Houston' s house. Within two hours, Mark safely moved Kelly, me, our pets and lives tock to freedom. Despite brilliant orchestration, pandemonium broke out wh en it was discovered that Kelly and I had been intercepted and detour ed from our intended demise. \"Wake up, sleeping beauty,\" Mark said as he gently roused me with a cup of fresh coffee. \"Welcome to a new day.\" My eyes opened. I had never experienced such kindness before, and it seemed like a whole new world to me. Mark presented me with a beautiful watch, which he strapped on my wrist. Noting my wonder and surprise, he explained, \"Now you will always know that 1 gave you the time of day.\" The time of day? No one had ever gi ven me their time before. They only took mine. And I never wore a watch before. I did not even know what month or year it was, let alone the tune of day. I had no concept of time, which Mark explained I must always monitor from that moment on.

Now there were three lives on the line. Mark understood that safety was tant amount to memory recovery. At the same time, none of us could be safe until I could recall who and what we were up against. Mark quickly sold everything he owned, including his DeLorean, retaining only basic necessities. He also sold the motor home which had been awarded me in my divorce from Alex Ho uston. Using these funds, Mark took Kelly and me to the peaceful wilderness of Alaska. February 4, 1988 marked the beginning of life for Kelly and me, free from our mind-controlled existence. It also marked the beginning of a new kind of survival as we embarked on \"The Mo st Dangerous Game\" of international proportions. Despite death threats and attempts, intimidation and cover-ups, we have survived these past seven years by refusing to keep secrets-which is in itself \"another story.\" 1 As quickly as the accuracy of my deprogramming notes were corroborated and/or verified, abstracts of various experiences and id entification of abusers were vastly disseminated.
