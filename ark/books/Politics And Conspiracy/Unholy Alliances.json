Once the home of the free and t he brave, we are now a country of decadence, occultism and ar rogant politicians. We are a people on the edge of collaps e — financial, political and moral. How did this happen ? Did this happen by accident or was it purposefully planned and designe d? Is it possible that this collapse is actually being perpetrated by a gr oup or groups who truly understand where we are headed? President Bush and others have told us plainly where we are headed — to a \"New World Order .\" To understand how we have arrived at this New World Order and wha t the term really means, we must look at how the American government has evolved and what it is today. The best way to do that is to inv estigate the government's own documents. In Report No. 2290, Investigation of Communist Prop aganda, from the House of Representatives, 71st Congress, 3rd Sessio n, dated January 17, 1931, one reads: \"The most tragic and appalling situation in Soviet Russia is the fact that many millions of young children attending the public schools are 7 A"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances taught each day hatred of the conception of God and of all religious faith and beliefs. This instruction is mandatory on the p art of teachers, and if they fail to carry out their orders they lose their jobs. These young school children are also taught to hold their parents in c ontempt and disobey them if they maintain any belief or faith in religi on. Documents and books presented to the committee indicate that the most terrible kinds of vice are encouraged among the young school children in order to break down their family influence, which is the foundatio n of all religion.\" 1 Consider what goes on in the public schools in the United States today. Are things much different from this description of the Soviet Communist system? Report 2290 continues: \"Article 121 of the Soviet C riminal Code, adopted in 1922, provides that instruction of child ren and minors in religious teachings or faith in state or private ed ucational institutions and schools is punishable by hard labor up to one year. This restriction has been followed up recently (1931) by forbidding the teach ing of religion to children by priests or ministers and by active athe istic instruction in the public schools. \"The Communist Party and the Soviet Government have done everything in their power since 1917 to mock, destr oy, and outlaw religion. Churches have been pulled down or turned into clubs , religious shrines despoiled, burial grounds desecrated, and the pries ts and clergy persecuted and slain. The denial of religious liberty and the wiping out of all religious beliefs is an important part of the commu nist program. Communists boast of being atheists and take pride i n waging war on God. The fact is that there is an irrepressible conflict between Russian communism and a belief in God. 2 \"The Communist Party began in 1929 a relentless cam paign to uproot and destroy every semblance of religious belief amo ng Russian Orthodoxes, Catholics, Protestants, Jews and Moslem s. Thousands of Russian priests, Jewish rabbis, Zionists, Catholic priests, and Protestant ministers have been arrested on flimsy charges and exiled to Siberia, or shot.\" 3 Their intention was to exterminate religion by bru tal methods. In the Investigation of Communist Propaganda, we le arn that the Communist Party in the United States was first orga nized in Chicago in September, 1919, 4 shortly after the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. This was the same year as the formation of the Council o n Foreign Relations who presently have complete control over all aspect s of the United States Government. The Communist activity in this country was found to be 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Communist Subversion in the American Government pervasive. The Investigation of Communist Propagand a declares: \"Hearings were held in practically every section of the United States where communist activities were reported, including Washi ngton, D.C., New York, Chicago, Detroit, Seattle, Portland (Oregon), San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chattanooga, Birmingham, Atlanta, New Orle ans and Memphis. Approximately 275 witnesses, including many from ot her cities and towns not mentioned above, such as Cleveland, Indianapoli s, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Pontiac, Flint, El Paso, El Centro, Gastonia and New Bedford, were heard by the committee...\" 5 The goal of the Communists was to alter the time-ho nored values of a free civilization — love of God, of family, the val ue of home life and work. The customary method was to sow immorality into the fabric of our social and educational system and to drive all those who c ould be driven into the sticky flypaper of greed and \"success.\" To subvert a society, this must be done only by unnoticeable degrees, of course. The conclusion of House Report No. 2290, from 1931 states: \"The problem of communism is bound up with our othe r social and economic problems. Hungry men are dangerous; but to the man with a home, a family, and a job, communism makes no appea l whatever. Communistic ideas are germs in the body politic... They are dangerous...[especially] when the resistance of tha t body [Congress] becomes weakened through social or selfish errors.\" 6 Needless to say, the Congress of the United States has been infected with these \"germs in the body politic.\" Our country has given away its jobs, its military and its sovereignty to the Unite d Nations. Only immoral and treasonous executive, judicial and legislative branches would allow the destruction of our nation's industry and national d efense. Our present government has not only allowed it to happen — it h as actually promoted it! A later report was published by the Government afte r further concerns of Communist infiltration led to another inquiry in to the likelihood of a Communist conspiracy. This was entitled Interlockin g Subversion in Government Departments published by the Internal Se curity Subcommittee of the United States Senate's 83rd Con gress, First Session dated July 30, 1953. This document describes, \"the extent, nature, and effects of subversive activities in the United Stat es,\" in which the Senate subcommittee shows that during their period of inve stigation they uncovered \"evidence of extensive Communist penetrat ion in Government.\" 7 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances The subcommittee \"noted that literally scores of ag ents had penetrated the United States Government, and in its report on the Institute of Pacific Relations, the subcommittee showed how some of thes e agents were responsible for extensive perversion of policy that consequently caused the loss of thousands of American lives and injury to the interests of the United States. It noted that except in a few cases all of these agents despite the record of their subversion, had escaped punishm ent and some, in positions of influence, continued to flourish even after their exposure.\" 8 In this government document, a repentant Elizabeth Bentley, explained to the Senate investigators that she had been \"acti vely engaged in Communist activity and Soviet espionage.\" 9 Bentley stated that espionage agents with whom she had been in contact had been w orking for the NKVD (Communist Secret Service). 10 The subcommittee document reads: The espionage groups with which Bentley worked were primarily \"employees of the United States Government statione d in Washington, D.C.\" 11 Named were numerous individuals involved with the Treasury Department, the United Nations, the OSS (which beca me the CIA) and even the Securities and Exchange Commission. 12 In addition, Miss Bentley testified that there were at least four Sov iet espionage rings operating within our Government but that only two h ad been exposed. The hearings went like this: Senator Ferguson. What were your avenues for placin g people in strategic positions? Miss Bentley. I would say that two of our best ones were Harry Dexter White and Lauchlin Currie. They had an immen se amount of influence and knew people and their word would b e accepted when they recommended someone. Senator William E. Jenner (Chairman). Harry Dexter White was in what department? Miss Bentley. Under Secretary of the Tr easury: under Mr. Morgenthau. Senator Ferguson. In other words, Currie and White were your instrumentalities in putting people in strategic po sitions? Miss Bentley. I would say they were our most import ant ones. Senator Ferguson. Yes. Did you have any other ones? Miss Bentley. Yes. I mean, whoever we had as an age nt in the Government would automatically serve for putting so meone else in. For example, Maurice Halperin was head of the Latin 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Communist Subversion in the American Government American Section in OSS (CIA), and we used him to g et Helen Tenney in. Once we got one person in he got others, and the whole process continued like that. Senator Ferguson.

Do you know who White's principal contacts were in the Government so that he could place people in government? Miss Bentley. It was my understanding that he knew practically everyone in Washington who had any influence. 13 The Communist infiltration of the Treasury Departme nt was most pervasive. Harry Dexter White was but one example. The subcommittee published three Treasury documents to prove how com plete was White's control over theTreasury. The first, was a letter w ritten December 15, 1941 by then Treasury Secretary Morgenthau: Treasury Department Order NO. 43 \"On and after this date, Mr. Harry D. White, Assist ant to the Secretary (of the Treasury), will assume full respo nsibility for all matters with which the Treasury Department has to deal having a bearing on foreign relations. Mr. White wi ll act as liaison between the Treasury Department and the Sta te Department, will serve in the capacity of adviser t o the Secretary on all Treasury foreign affairs matters, and will assume responsibility for the management and operat ion of the Stabilization Fund without change in existing proce dures.

He was finally forced to resign in 1946, but stange ly enough he was not imprisoned for sedition or treason. Rather, he was commended and rewarded. Here are the departing words of our elect ed President to this known Communist subversive: April 30, 1946 \"Dear Mr. White: I accept with regret your resignat ion as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury. \"My regret is lessened, however, in the knowledge t hat you leave the Treasury only to assume new duties for th e Government in the field of international economics as the United States Executive Director of the Internation al Monetary Fund.

Alger His s, it was discovered, worked directly for the Russians. The subcommittee identified Alger Hiss as a Communist infiltrator of the American governme nt. 18 Hiss was intimate with the leaders of the Institute of Pacif ic Relations which the subcommittee found to be infiltrated by Communists. Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White eventually gained control of the innermost command posts affecting American Foreign policy. During the subcommittee hearings Dr. Edna Fluegal, a former State Departmen t foreign-affairs specialist was asked about Hiss' ultimate access to top secret documents. Mr. Morris. What documents or what material would b e available to him [Hiss] in that role? Miss Fluegal. Everything that existed. Mr. Morris. Everything in the entire Department of the highest classification? Miss Fluegal. Yes. At that particular time, you see , postwar involved everything, economics, social, political. 19 J. Anthony Panuch, Deputy Assistant Secretary of St ate in charge of security had been assigned by then Secretary of Sta te James F. Byrnes to supervise the security aspects to the transfer of p ersonnel and functions from World War II agencies to the State Department in the fall of 1945 (post WWII). Although Alger Hiss remained in power until 1947 as Director of the office which initiated American pol icy on United Nations questions. Panuch's exposure of His s finally forced his resignation. For this patriotic service to his coun try, Panuch was dismissed from the State Department! The Subcommittee interview with Panuch went like th is: Mr. Morris. This is your conference with whom? Mr. Panuch. Secretary Byrnes. He said, \"Why don't y ou submit your resignation to General Marshall and I will talk to him about you 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances and let you know?\" When General Marshall came from Hawaii, Secretary Brynes did talk to him, and I was told that \"Genera l Marshall wants to see you, talk to you, immediately, and he wants to have you stay on.\" The next day I was told by a newspaperman that I wa s slated to get the full treatment, and I found out that Sec retary Acheson, who was then Under Secretary Acheson... would not t olerate my being around the Department. Senator Welker. Who was this? Dean Acheson would no t tolerate your being around the Department? Mr. Panuch. If he were Under Secretary under Genera l Marshall; yes. So, I made the necessary preparations, and I stayed around to be called by General Marshall, and one of my people was taking care of his engagement desk, and the engagement was constantly being put off, and so... on January 23, at 5:30 tha t night, Under Secretary Acheson called me into his office, and we had a conversation and he said, \"Joe, you and I haven't g otten along very well,\" and he said, \"Now General Marshall has asked me to take over here as Under Secretary until Mr. Lovett comes over and I told him that I would do so only on condition that I would have complete charge of the administration of the D epartment and, as you and I don't see eye to eye on various m atters, I would like your resignation.\" 20 Needless to say, Panuch, who identified Alger Hiss, was forced out by Acheson. Hiss was Secretary-General of the U.N.'s f ounding conference held in San Francisco, a member of the semi-secret Council on Foreign Relations and a secret Soviet agent. The House Un-American Activities Committee explaine d in 1953, that condemning information surfaced on Alger Hiss and o ther Communist infiltrators as early as 1945. Yet, it was not unti l after the Committee had its hearings in 1948 that any action was taken. Rat her \"these people staved in their jobs, received promotions, and influenced policy for several years after impressive information had been marshal led.\" 21 \"In the case of this subcommittee's inquiry into American c itizens at the United Nations, the Federal Bureau of Investigation... had transmitted derogatory information to the proper authorities in the State Department years earlier.\" 22 Another Communist exposed was Frank Coe. When th e Senate 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Communist Subversion in the American Government subcommittee subpoenaed Coe in December of 1952, he held the position of Secretary of the International Monetary Fund (IM F). In 1944, Coe had been the technical secretary of the Bretton Woo ds Monetary Conference where the articles of agreement were dra fted which set up the IMF. As long ago as 1953, the IMF handled assets of $7-8 billion. The IMF is a specialized agency of the United Nations. 23 Harold Glasser was another Communist infiltrator. ( Note Communism's constant infiltration of the key money positions of the nation.) Glasser was the financial expert of the Am erican delegation in the formation of the United Nations Relief and Rehabili tation Administration (UNRRA). He was one of those who was responsible fo r determining which countries should receive aid from UNRRA and w hich should not. In the spring of 1947, Glasser was an adviser to Secre tary of State Marshall at the meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers in Moscow. 24 Victor Perlo was another known Communist who was ev entually forced to leave. He was employed by the Treasury De partment Division of Monetary Research. His duties included the follo wing: To serve as an adviser and be responsible for recom mending actions required in the following fields: a. Aspects of domestic economy in relation to inter national financial affairs such as the supply of money and its speed o f circulation, bank deposits, and lending activity, the volume of private savings and their absorption through domestic investments, production, and employment trends in industries with important pote ntial export markets. b. The effects on domestic economy of current inter national financial developments and the prospective effects of interna tional financial proposals. 25 The reader will note that these aspects of finance are traditionally the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Does this me an that Perlo as a Communist conspirator worked for the privately owne d Federal Reserve? Yes. Since these duties are the traditional respons ibility of the Federal Reserve this proves that Perlo, an identified Commu nist, worked for the Fed. Another conspirator exposed by the subcommittee was David Weintraub. Weintraub became the Director of the Eco nomic Stability and Development Division of the Secretariat of the United Nations. Weintraub also helped make policies in important ag encies affecting the interests of the United States; specifically, as as sistant to Harry Hopkins, 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances Director of the Federal Emergency Relief Administra tion. Weintraub employed a running list of Communists at the United Nations. Rose Alpher, Weintraub's sister was also identified as a Communist. 26 We are reminded of ex-Communist Bentley's statement s to the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee: \"Whoever we had as an agent would automatically serve for putting someone else in... Once we got one person in, he got others, and the whole process con tinued like that... We trained our agents to make what good con tacts they could here in Washington in order that should they need t o get into a better job, they would have the contact ready.\" 27 The subcommittee stated: \"They (the Communists) use d each other's names for reference... They hired each other. They promoted each other. They raised each other's salaries. They transferred each other from bureau to bureau, from department to department, from cong ressional committee to congressional committee. They assigned each othe r to international missions. They vouched for each other's loyalty and protected each other when exposure threatened....\" 28 This must sound familiar to anyone observing the American Congress. The subcommittee found that, \"Virtually all were gr aduates of American universities. Many had doctorates or simil ar ratings of academic and intellectual distinction...\" Some were teachers . 29 The subcommittee was \"impressed by the extent to wh ich the Communists it... exposed were able to move, often w ith great facility, from one Government agency to another, spinning their we b of intrigue and drawing with them in positions of power and influen ce their confederates and auxiliaries...\" 30 The Senate Report states that the FBI and other age ncies learned the underlying facts of the \"Communist Conspiracy\" and \"time and time again performed their duty and notified the proper admini strative agencies of this information.\" 31 The subcommittee explained, \"The breakdown in the loyalty machinery, encountered in this series of he arings, was basically not in the detection of evidence. Primarily, the breakd own came in the failure on the part of responsible executive agencies to ac t on the information which was available.\" 32 However, the government Senate Report laments, \"It was apparent to the subcommittee that either these agencies had no security safeguards whatever, or else had no disclination toward hiring Communists. There was evidence concerning scores of such employees... . The positions that these people held were often important and at a pol icymaking level.\" 33 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Communist Subversion in the American Government In frustration the congressmen complained: \"There i s a mass of evidence and information on the hidden Communist co nspiracy in Government which is still inaccessible to the Feder al Bureau of Investigation and to this subcommittee because pers ons who know the facts of this conspiracy are not cooperating with t he security authorities of the country.\" 34 The subcommittee sadly admitted: \"With the limited resources and data available to the subcommittee, we have been ab le to indicate only the pattern of such infiltration... \"The subcommittee was in no position to make any ov erall investigation of the agencies mentioned. The... dat a, therefore, was purely incidental and does not depict the full situation.\" 35 They understood there were powerful forces already in Government, p erhaps even controlling Government, which were fighting against them: \"The subcommittee is aware of the campaign being conduct ed against the fact-gathering agencies of the Government, both of the executive and legislative, and must deplore the inroads this camp aign has made.\" 36 The subcommittee was frustrated because \"virtually all of the witnesses... invoked their privilege against incrim ination when asked about the details of the conspiracy.\" Senator Jenner stat ed, \"...the fifth amendment is being perverted into a shield to conce al the facts of the Communist conspiracy. \"The subcommittee has labored, under its senatorial mandate, to produce for the record evidence outlining the patte rn and design of the Soviet conspiracy against our Government and agains t our academic institutions... But this conspiracy yields up its s ecrets grudgingly and in meager portions.\" 37 One Communist infiltrator, John P. Davies, \"said th at he was aware that they (his comrades) were considered Communists by some uninformed persons, but that they were not Communis ts but 'only very (politically) sophisticated.' \" 38 The design of the Communists as described by the su bcommittee was explained like this: \"When the principal concern of Government was economic recovery, they were in the Agricultural Ad justment Administration, the Works Progress Administration, the National Recovery Administration... During the war, they joi ned... the Board of Economic Warfare, the Federal Economic Administrati on, the Office of Strategic Services, and the like. Toward the end of the war and in the postwar period, they were operating in the foreign policy field. At the end 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances of the war, they were gravitating toward the intern ational agencies. 39 Indeed, the first Communist cell in the United Stat es was formed around agriculture in the 1930s. Six members of the parent Communist cell worked for the Department of Agriculture, one of wh om was Communist Alger Hiss. George N. Peek, the Agricultural Adjust ment Administration's first administrator (under Roosevelt) wrote: \"A plague of young lawyers settled on Washington... plans [were formed] which eventually turned AAA from a device t o aid the farmer to a device to introduce the collectivist system of ag riculture into this country. \"...they also wanted to be rid of me. They wanted t o purge the AAA of all businessmen or any others who did not welcom e the coming of the new day of revolution. (The New World Order*) \"These prattlers were for the most part employees o f the Government and had taken the oath of allegiance. But they took the position that their high purposes gave them a supermorality that could not be confused with the morality the Nation had been using. They were q uite above such old- fogy, Tory, reactionary stuff as oaths of office or other religious antiquities. They owed allegiance, not to the United States — pa triotism was for the nonthinking. They had a higher allegiance — an alle giance to the \"Cause.\" The end justified the means.\" 40 The senate subcommittee exposed the fact that the C ommunist infiltrators \"colonized key committees of Congress. They helped write laws, conduct congressional hearings, and write con gressional reports. \"They advised Cabinet members, wrote speeches for t hem, and represented them in intergovernmental conferences. They staffed interdepartmental committees which prepared basic A merican and world policy. \"They traveled to every continent as emissaries and representatives of the American people. They attended virtually every international conference where statesmen met to shape the future. \" 41 The section of the subcommittee's document entitled , \"The Extent Of The Penetration,\" disclosed that according to the e vidence uncovered, those involved in the secret Communist underground included the: • Executive assistant to the President of the United States; • Assistant Secretary of the Treasury; • United States Treasury Attache in China; • Director of the Office of Special Political Affairs for the State *Author's addition. 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Communist Subversion in the American Government Department; • Secretary of the International Monetary Fund; • Head of the Latin-American Division of the Office o f Strategic Services; • Member of the National Labor Relations Board; • Chief counsel, Senate Subcommittee on Civil Liberti es; • Chief, Statistical Analysis Branch, War Production Board; • Treasury Department representative and adviser in Financial Control Division of the North African Economic Boar d in United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation and at the Counci l of Foreign Ministers in Moscow; • Director, National Research Project of the Works Progress Administration. 42 Another example of Communist infiltration was Lauch lin Currie, President Roosevelt's adviser on far eastern affair s. He served as Roosevelt's personal emissary to Chiang Kai-shek. T he Subcommittee learned that one of the thefts of classified docume nts by Currie and his cohorts \"was a lengthy document detailing the locat ion of the units of the Nationalist Army of China (Chiang Kai-shek's army), their strength, how they were armed, where they were located...\" 43 Our Ambassador to China, Clarence E. Gauss, disturb ed by the pro- Communist stance of his diplomatic staff wrote to S ecretary of State, Cordell Hull on August 31, 1944: \"...China should receive the entire support and sym pathy of the United States Government on the domestic problem of Chines e Communists. Very serious consequences for China may result from our attitude. In urging that China resolve differences with the Communists, our Government's attitude is serving only to intensify the recalcitrance of t he Communists. The request that China meet Communist demands is equiva lent to asking China's unconditional surrender to a party known to be under a foreign power's influence (the Soviet Union).\" 44 General Patrick J. Hurley, wrote on November 26, 19 45 to President Truman: \"...The astonishing feature of our foreign policy i s the wide discrepancy between our announced policies and our conduct of international relations.

Colonel John Beaty, in his book The Iron Curtain Ov er America, states: \"Thus President Truman, Ambassador Marshall , and the State Department prepared the way for the fall of China t o Soviet control.

Wedemeyer who had serv ed as Commander-in-Chief of American Forces in the Asian Theater and Special Representative of the President of the United State s, transmitted his report, United States Relations with China, to the Presiden t. In the section entitled, \"Implications of 'No Assistance' to China or Contin uation of 'Wait and See' Policy,\" General Wedemeyer wrote: \"To advise at this time a policy of 'no assistance' to China would suggest the withdrawal of the United States Militar y and Naval Advisory Groups from China and it would be equivalent to cut ting the ground from under the feet of the Chinese Government (that of C hiang Kai-shek). Removal of American assistance, without removal of Soviet assistance, would certainly lay the country open to eventual Co mmunist domination. It would have repercussions in other parts of Asia, would lower American prestige in the Far East and would make easier the spread of Soviet influence and Soviet expansion not only in Asia but in other parts of the world.\" 47 The result of General Wedemeyer's disclosure? He wa s discharged from diplomacy and exiled from the Pentagon.

In the section \"Net in the State De partment\" of Interlocking Subversion in Government Departments, we find that the Senate subcommittee \"encountered significant infilt ration\" into the State Department as well. 49 Another telling piece of the document put together by the House Un- American Activities Committee is the section called \"The Net Over Capitol Hill.\" In this section, reference is made to an article in Collier's magazine (Feb. 8, 1947) written by Senator Robert M. La Foll ette. Here are some of the significant passages: \"I know from firsthand experience that Communist sy mpathizers have infiltrated into committee staffs on Capitol Hill i n Washington...A few years ago, when I was chairman of the Senate Civil Liberties Committee, I was forced to take measures in an effort to stamp out influences within my own committee staff. \"During the late Congress, the staff of a subcommit tee of the Senate Committee on Education and Labor was infiltrated by fellow travelers*. The staff of the Pepper subcommittee on Wartime Hea lth and Education...probably did great harm to the cause of improved health in this country by its reckless activities. I was appo inted a member of this subcommittee, but I resigned from it later.. .parti ally because I did not want to be associated with a program of a staff in whom I could not have complete confidence. \"Later, the staff released a report and recommendat ions on health legislation under highly irregular procedure that p rompted severe criticism on the floor of the Senate. The report wa s a favorable recommendation on a highly controversial national h ealth program. It was released with the implication that it had the appro val of the sub and full committees. (National Health Care has been planned for a long time.) \"Similarly, the Kilgore subcommittee on War Mobiliz ation...and the Murray Special Committee on Small Business had staf fs that many Senators believed had been infiltrated by fellow tr avelers. *Fellow traveler: An avid supporter of the Communis t agenda but not a member of the Communist Party; Liberal, often a m ember of the Masonic Lodge or other secret society. 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances \"One of the important ways in which fellow traveler s on committee staffs have carried on their activities is through the illicit use of committee information... \"On several occasions I have had the revealing expe rience of receiving prompt protests and advice from strange and remote sources the day after I had voiced anti-Communist sentiments or voted con trary to the prevailing Communist Party line in executive sessions that wer e wholly unreported in the press. Such reactions could not occur withou t an effective grapevine...\" 50 The document goes on to show that many staffers of House and Senate leaders were conspirators as well. Not only was Con gress infiltrated, but national defense and military was also. From the se ction titled, \"Network in National Defense, we read: \"In its decision of April 20, 1953, the Subversive Activities Control Board found that the Communist Party, USA, had as i ts objective 'the overthrow of the United States Government'.... Towa rd this end, the penetration of key agencies engaged in national def ense was paramount.\" 51 A necessary agency to be infiltrated by the Communi sts was the OSS which later became the CIA. One of the interviews w ith Communist John Lautner was recorded this way: Mr. Lautner. \"I was a graduate of Military Intellig ence and I was assigned to Psychological Warfare in propaganda wor k.\" Senator Ferguson. \"And you were a Communist?\" Mr. Lautner. \"I was a member of the Communist Party at the time of my induction.\" Senator Ferguson. \"Now, who was your superior offic er in the Military Intelligence, Psychological Warfare?\" Mr. Lautner. \"In Psychological Warfare, my superior officer was Peter Rhodes, who was in charge of the Mediterranea n theater of operations monitoring system at that time.\" Senator Ferguson. \"Was he a Communist?\" Mr. Lautner. \"Later on I found out he was.\" 52 (Not even Lautner knew!) A directive from the War Department, dated December 30, 1944, refers to the subject \"Disposition of Subversive and Disaf fected Military Personnel,\" and is addressed to the commanding gene rals of all commands. This directive reads: \"Questions have arisen as to the significance, unde r reference letter, of 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Communist Subversion in the American Government membership in, and sympathy with the views of, the Communist Party. \"The basic consideration is now the propriety of th e individual's opinions...Membership in, or strict adherence to th e doctrines of, the Communist Party organization is evidence that the i ndividual is subject to influences that may tend to divide his loyalty...Su ch influences must be appraised in the light of the individual's entire r ecord.

Later, on February 27, 1945, the Committee on Milit ary Affairs of the House of Representatives interviewed John J. McCloy , the assistant Secretary of War and Rockefeller employee. In McClo y's own words, he said, \"I should like to point out that the Hatch Ac t does not provide that any member of the Communist Party shall be excluded fro m the Army...\" 54 In disgust, the report from the Subcommittee to inv estigate Interlocking Subversion in Government Departments c oncludes, \"The subcommittee had little difficulty in understanding why there was Communist penetration of our Armed Forces during th e war.\" 55 Next comes another revealing shocker which explains the plight of American privacy today: \"The Internal Security Subcommittee hearings of 195 1 and 1952 had developed extensive evidence that the American Comm unications Association was a Communist-controlled union. While reviewing this evidence and taking additional testimony, the chair man of this subcommittee learned on May 26, 1953, that this uni on was organizing the personnel who are now manning the communication lin es of our most sensitive defense agencies, with access to the cabl es and wires of our Government!\" 56 This included the awarding of Government contracts by the Air Force, the Navy, and the Signal Corps for t he development of special electronic equipment. The subcommittee \"mad e every effort to prevent the recertification of this Communist union ...\" 57 This concerned Senator William E. Jenner, the chairman of the Inte rnal Security Subcommittee who promptly notified the Senate Labor Committee, the President of the United States, the Secretary of De fense, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the chairmen of the House Labor and Judiciary Committees. Part of the letter reads: \"The Senate Internal Security Subcommit tee takes 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances cognizance of this situation as possessing a threat to the internal security of this country... \"Accordingly, as chairman of the Internal Security Subcommittee, I ask that you give consideration to the enactment of whatever legislation there is before y our committee that would remedy the present danger to t he country.

Jenner Chairman Internal Security Committee\" 58 The senate report describes the result of this lett er: \"Despite this, the NLRB (National Labor Relations B oard) did certify the ACA (American Communications Association) as th e bargaining unit of Western Union employees on June 3, 1953.\" During the Chicago \"massacre,\" the San Francisco dock and general stri ke, and other employer-labor clashes it is a fact that \"secret Co mmunist agents were speaking and acting on behalf of the United States Government... The same agents were preparing reports and documents on which national labor policy was being made, and out of which a vast quan tity of labor history has since been written.\" 59 The millions of jobs that have left this country ha ve not left by accident. The senate report entitled Interlocking S ubversion in Government Departments indicates that \"...there was an interla cing combination of these people in almost every agency, both executive and legislative, which had to do with labor.\" 60 The conclusions of the Senate Report, Interlocking Subversion in Government Departments dated July 30, 1953 were: 1.

This penetration has extended from the lower ranks to top-level policy and operating positions in our Government. 3. The agents of this penetration have operated in acc ordance with a distinct design... 4. Members of this conspiracy helped to get each other into Government, helped each other to rise in Government and protected each other from exposure. 5.

In general, the Communists who infiltrated our Gove rnment worked behind the scenes — guiding research and preparing memoranda on which basic American policies were set, writing spe eches for Cabinet officers, influencing congressional investi gations, drafting laws, manipulating administrative reorganizations.. . 7. Thousands of diplomatic, political, military, scien tific, and economic secrets of the United States have been sto len. 8. Despite the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investi gation and other security agencies had reported extensive informatio n about this Communist penetration, little was done bv the Execu tive branch to interrupt the Soviet operatives in their ascent in Government. 9. Powerful groups and individuals within the executiv e branch were at work obstructing and weakening the effort t o eliminate Soviet agents from positions in Government. 10. Members of the conspiracy repeatedly took sworn oat hs denying Communist Party membership when seeking appointment s, transfers, and promotions and these falsifications have, in virtually every case, gone unpunished. 11. The control that the American Communications Associ ation, a Communist-directed union, maintains over communicat ion lines vital to the national defense poses a threat to the security of this country. 12. Policies and programs laid down by members of the S oviet conspiracy are still in effect within our Governmen t and constitute a continuing hazard to our national security. 61 Now you understand why the United States is disarmi ng unilaterally. Although the subcommittee asked the Department of J ustice for action on its findings as early as September, 1951, by Jul y, 1953, the Department of Justice had taken no action. To understand why t he Department of Justice would not react against known Communist sub versives in government we must refer to a previous document whi ch was apparently overlooked by the subcommittee. That document was p reviously referred to as House of Representatives Report No. 2290, 71s t Congress, 3rd Session entitled Investigation of Communist Propaga nda, dated January 17, 1931. The report states that, \"The Government, by use of the provisions of 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances the war-time legislation, drove the Communist Party underground, where it remained in an illegal status until 1924, when t he repeal of the measures and the consequent halting of government activities by the agents of the Department of Justice, permitted it to reappear. Th e communists came more and more into the open until today they flaunt their revolutionary activities throughout the country. Since 1925 the D epartment of Justice has had no power, no authority, or no funds from th e Congress to investigate communist propaganda or activities. Dur ing the period that the Department of Justice had actual authority the Communist Party was driven underground where it could not function succ essfully. Just so long as the agents of the Department of Justice were act ive the movement remained comparatively stationary and innocuous. At the present time the Communist Party of the United States is thoroug hly and highly organized, nationally and locally, and is extremely active.\" 62 This was written in 1931, and there has been no further bulw ark against Communism since! So how far gone do you suppose thi ngs are now? At the time our Government was studying the effects of subversive activity, it occurred to the representatives to inv estigate the use of foundation money to support these subversive activi ties. The Communists were never short of money. The final report came fr om a select committee created by House Resolution 561, 82nd Congress, 2nd Session, Report No. 2514 dated January 1, 1953. Once again, the evidenc e poured in. The committee knowingly concluded the following: \"That the Communists succeeded in obtaining from th e foundations financial aid and assistance for numerous members a nd sympathizers seems conclusive to the committee. In the aggregate , the number of such grants and the amounts involved are alarming...\" 63 \"It has been established that some foundation funds have gone to the support of the Communist line or to proved Communis ts or Communist sympathizers...\" 64 \"The impact of foundation money upon education has been very heavy, largely tending to promote uniformity in app roach and method, tending to induce the educator to become an agent f or social change and a propagandist for the development of our society i n the direction of some form of collectivism (Communism*).\" 65 The Report cited \"foundation support for the Russia n area studies at various universities, for the translation of Russia n books, [and] for studies *Author's addition. 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Communist Subversion in the American Government in the social sciences deemed socialistic.\" 66 The social sciences which play the key role in the development of a society, were \"almost wholly in the control of the professional employees of the large foundations...\" 67 The select committee found that the foundations have at tained a concentration of power which has tended to promote \"moral relativ ity,\" to the detriment of our basic moral, religious, and governmental pri nciples. 68 They determined that the large foundation \"can exercise. ..elements of thought control.\" 69 The committee warned that, \"The aggregate thought- control power of this foundation and foundation-supported b ureaucracy can hardly be exaggerated.\" 70 They determined that, \"In the international field, foundations...have exercised a strong effect upon our foreign policy a nd upon public education in things international. This has been accomplished by vast propaganda. by supplying executives and advisers to government and by controlling much research in this area through the power of the purse. The net result...has been to promote 'internationalism'...a form directed toward 'world government'... Foundations have supported a conscious distortion of history, propagandized blindly for the United Na tions as the hope of the world... and leaned toward a generally 'leftist ' approach to international problems.\" 71 The Report of the Select Committee to Investigate Foundations, 82nd Congress, 2nd Session of 1953 sta tes that, \"Those foundations which are concerned with internationali sm along political lines appear to center their activities around projects w hich support the Government policy of participation in United Nation s activities.\" 72 Committee chairman, B. Carroll Reece (R., TN) remar ked: \"...I feel compelled to observe that, if a more com prehensive study is desired, the inquiry might be continued by the Eigh ty-third Congress with profit in view of the importance of the subject (in vestigation of foundations), the fact that tax-exempt funds in ver y large amounts are spent without public accountability or official sup ervision of any sort, and that, admittedly, considerable questionable exp enditures have been made.\" 73 The findings of the Reece Committee demonstrated th at \"foundation funds are public funds\" and that since the foundati ons are public trusts, foundations administer funds of which the public is the equitable owner. The committee stated that the foundation system \"gi ves enormous power to a relatively small group of individuals, having at their virtual command, huge sums in public trust funds It is a system whic h is antithetical to American principles.\" 74 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances Naturally the committee felt the animosity of the e ntire Communist- Establishment Elite working against them. They said , \"...The pressure against Congressional investigation has been almost incredible. As indicated by their arrogance in dealing with this c ommittee, the major foundations...have entrenched themselves behind a t otality of power which presumes to place them bevond serious critici sm and attack.\" 75 Let us take a brief look at how the schools were ov errun with Communist propaganda. The Intercollegiate Socialist Society was organized in New York in 1905 with its avowed objec t: \"to promote an intelligent interest in Socialism among college men and women.\" It welcomed both students and teachers in colleges and universities, and it had numerous chapters in various educational instit utions. 76 Control over the education process was most important to the Com munists. In 1919, Mrs. Marion E. Sproul, a Boston school teacher, pro claimed: \"Give us one generation of small children to train to manhood an d womanhood and we will set up the Bolshevist form of the Soviet Gover nment.\" 77 By 1921, there were already organizations of the Intercolleg iate Liberal League (Communist front organization) in 250 colleges and universities in this country. Other such fronts were the National Studen t Forum and the League for Industrial Democracy. It was during this time that the Harvard Liberal Club's application for membership in the As sociated Harvard Clubs was rejected because of its radicalism. A tho rough investigation of the club and the league was made. In the report it was shown that some outside agency was financing the establishment of t he league and the various clubs and their activities. This paragraph appears in the report from this investigation: \"It would appear that the Harvard Liberal Club, Har vard Students' Liberal Club and the Intercollegiate Liberal League may be the means devised and about to be used as propaganda agencies by radical movements not yet disclosed. The Russian theory of instilling sympathetic ideas in the younger generation while they are stil l in school is well known, and after a brief examination... it appears more th an likely that the system is being put into execution among college students in this country.\" 78 It is the purpose of the Communists to alienate the American youth from the precepts of this country. All concept of A merican history, the Constitutional Republic and all that stood for has already been removed from the minds of our young. Public and private sch ools, colleges and universities are the feeding ground of the \"Intelle ctual\" Communists. In fact, \"the agents of the party have been deliberate ly 'planted' in the 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Communist Subversion in the American Government educational institutions of the United States for t he purpose of making converts of the young.\" 79 The brilliant, moreover, are not excused from this brain-washing. Rather, \"it is safe to say that no institution of learning in the country has been so thoroughly saturated wit h the 'liberal' activity as Harvard University.\" 80 \"The writings of Lenin, Trotsky or other high priests of Communism, as well as those of Marx and Engels, have been and undoubtedly still are used as text-books, or as pre scribed reading, in classes or clubs in Wellesley, Vassar, Smith, Yale and many other colleges.\" 81 Such an inroad of silent subversive activity is pat ently dangerous, as students of college age, while mentally keen, activ e and alert, have not formed their permanent characters and are still at a formative period in their mental development, during which they are par ticularly susceptible to the influence of older minds, especially those of t heir professors who they are accustomed to look up to as fountains of author ity, wisdom, and guidance. Lenin once said: \"When a country is selected for at tack we must first set up before the youth of that land a mental barra ge which will forever prohibit the possibility of that youth being moulde d into an armed force to oppose our invading armies. This can most successfu lly be done through creating 'war horror' thought and by teaching of pa cifism and non- resistance. It will be found that powerful organiza tions of non-communists can be created for this purpose particularly with t he aid of liberal-minded ministers, professors and lecturers.\" 82 The Communist plan was not only to infiltrate and i ndoctrinate the universities but also the churches. Testimony from Mr. Manning Johnson, a former official of the Communist Party, USA, to t he United States Un- American Activities Committee in 1953 exposed the m ethod: \"Once the tactic of infiltration of religious organizations w as set by the Kremlin, ...the Communists discovered that the destruction o f religion could proceed much faster through infiltration... This po licy of infiltrating seminaries was successful bevond even our Communist expectations.\" 83 Communist Mikhail Bucharin said: \"Friendship of lib eral-minded ministers shall be sought, as these men are at the present time the leaders of the masses. Conferences on economic conditions a mong the people shall be held from time to time with these minister s, educators and other liberal elements and through their influences the p arty shall aim to secure a more favorable hearing before the people.\" 84 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances Any discussion of Communism today may seem prepospe rous. The media has determined that \"Communism is dead.\" Neve rtheless, they refuse to comment on the 1.2 billion people — over 20% of the world's population, that remain under the yoke of Communism . 85 Is it possible that much more than we have realized, the yoke of Commun ism has tightened on us all? In May, 1919, at Dusseldorf, Germany, allied forces captured a very significant document. It was called Communist Rules for Revolution. These were the processes by which the Communist objective s were to be achieved. As you read these, consider what is happe ning in America today. Communist Rules for Revolution A. Corrupt the young; get them away from religion. Get them interested in sex. Make them superficial; destroy t heir ruggedness. B. Get control of all means of publicity, thereby: 1. Get people's minds off their government by focusing their attention on athletics (Tonya Harding & Nancy Kerri gan; O.J. Simpson*), sexy books and plays and other trivialit ies. 2. Divide the people into hostile groups by constantly harping on controversial matters of no importance. 3. Destroy the people's faith in their natural leaders by holding them up to contempt and ridicule. 4. Always preach true democracy, but seize power as fa st and as ruthlessly as possible. (Waco, Oklahoma bombing*) 5. By encouraging Government extravagance, destroy its credits, produce fear of inflation with rising prices and ge neral discontent.

The facts are that: The Congressional Record definitely demonstrates th at early in this century there was proven Communist penetration into the United States of America. That penetration covered many if not all s tates and metropolitan areas. It infiltrated the colleges and universities and affected and infected the teachers and the books from which they taught. The churches were infiltrated with Communist Party members via the at tack on the seminaries and the eventual control over what was taught there . Not only the schools and churches have been infiltrated but so was the S tate Department and the halls of Congress. We know from sworn testimony tha t when a Communist was able to achieve a certain position, he or she w as trained to bring even more Communists into positions of power. How could this happen? Even though Khruschev foreto ld it, we were sure he was crazy. But he doesn't seem so crazy now .

It is no coincidence that on the first day o f May 1776, Adam Weishaupt founded the secret society known as the Illuminati in Ingolstadt, Germany. 1 May the 1st is also the feast day of the great Celtic pagan festival named Beltane which was celebrated on the pyramidal-shaped hills of Scotland and Ireland. Proof of the Illuminati's existence arises from a c ollection of original papers and correspondence found in 1786 by the Bava rian government who searched the house of a member of the Order of the Illuminati named Zwack. Shortly thereafter, Baron Knigge, also a mem ber of the Illuminati, published an account of the higher degrees.

Abolition of all religion. 3 One notices immediately the similarity between the goals of the Illuminati and the goals of the Communist Party. Th ey are one and the same. Weishaupt taught his members: 1. \"We must acquire the direction of education — of ch urch- management — of the professorial chair, and of the pulpit. We must bring our opinions into fashion by every art — spre ad them among the people by the help of young writers. We must pr each the warmest concern for humanity, and make people indif ferent to all other relations. We must take care that our writers be well puffed, and that the Reviewers do not depreciate them; ther efore we must endeavor by every mean to gain over the Reviewers a nd Journalists; and we must also try to gain the booksellers, who i n time will see that it is their interest to side with us.\" 4 2. \"There is no way of influencing men so powerfully a s by means of the women. These should therefore be our chief stud y; we should insinuate ourselves into their good opinion, give t hem hints of emancipation from the tyranny of public opinion, an d of standing up for themselves; it will be an immense relief to the ir enslaved minds to be freed from any one bond of restraint, and it will fire them the more, and cause them to work for us with zeal, with out knowing that they do so; for they will only be indulging th eir own desire of personal admiration. 3. \"We must win the common people in every corner. Thi s will be obtained chiefly by means of the schools, and by op en, hearty behaviour, show, condescension, popularity, and tol eration of their prejudices, which we shall at leisure root out and dispel. 4. \"If a writer publishes anything that attracts notic e, and is in itself just, but does not accord with our plan, we must en deavor to win him over, or decry him. 5 35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances 5. \"In like manner we must try to obtain an influence in the military academies...the printing-houses, booksellers shops, chapters and in short in all offices which have any effect, either in forming, or in managing, or even in directing the mind of man: pai nting and engraving are highly worth our care.\" 6 \"By establishing reading societies; and subscription libraries, and taking t hese under our direction, and supplying them...we may turn the pub lic mind which way we will.\" 7 6. \"Could our Prefect fill the judicatories (Judges) o f a state with our worthy members, he does all that man can do for the Order.\" 8 The Illuminati realized the great need to maintain cont rol over the legal system of a nation — to make laws suitable to their effort and to win prejudicial favor in the courts. 7. \"The power of the Order must surely be turned to th e advantage of its Members. All must be assisted. They must be pre ferred to all persons otherwise of equal merit. Money, services, honor, goods, and blood, must be expended for the fully proved Br ethren.. .\" 9 The Illuminati's efforts were directed so that each individual was placed where his talents would do the most good for the Order. The Illuminati, like the CIA, obtained \"the most comple te knowledge...of the real worth of every person;\" thereby, the Order wou ld place every man in that situation in which he could be most effective. 10 The initiates were convinced that the Order would one day rule the wor ld. Every member therefore would eventually become a ruler. Those who are considered the profane; that is, thos e who do not agree with the philosophy of the Illuminati, were to be s urrounded constantly by its members. The Iluminati believed that \"If any pe rson is more disposed to listen to Princes than to the Order, he is not f it for it, and must rise no higher. We must do our utmost to procure the advanc ement of Illuminati into all important civil offices.\" 11 Weishaupt wrote, \"...we shall direct all mankind...The occupations must be so allotted and c ontrived, that we may, in secret, influence all political transaction s.\" 12 Once in place the politician was to equivocate in o rder to remain sufficiently ambiguous so the people would not unde rstand that he was indeed following the plan of his superiors. \"One mu st speak, first in one way, then in another, so as not to commit oneself a nd to make one's real way of thinking impenetrable to one's inferiors.\" 13 This sounds like contemporary politics, doesn't it?

Their own papers found by the Bavari an authorities proclaimed the desire to bring about \"the universal revolution that should deal the death-blow to society.\" \"Princes and natio ns,\" Weishaupt had written, \"shall disappear off the face of the earth ; yes, the time will come when men will have no other laws than the book of n ature; this revolution will be the work of the secret societies, and that is one of our great mysteries.\" 14 In order to accomplish this, it was necessary to ro ot out all ideas of a hereafter, all fear of retribution for evil deeds, and to substitute the religion of Reason for these Christian \"superstitions.\" Weis hauupt claimed that, \"When at last Reason becomes the religion of men, t hen will the problem be solved.\" 15 True men of God were to be considered the enemy. Weishaupt declared: \"Princes and Priests are in par ticular...the wicked, whose hands [we] must tie up...if we cannot root th em out altogether.\" 16 Weishaupt planned that the Illuminati would strengt hen their association by numbers; in time they would become p owerful, and when they were powerful they would be \"terrible to the w icked\" (to all who oppose them). Because of fear of reprisal, Weishaup t knew many would support the Illuminati's efforts. Weishaupt planned to \"bind the hands of the rest, and finally conquer them.\" 17 Only imagine how great is the power and control of this evil occult sect today, over 20 0 years and little opposition later. Concealment Adam Weishaupt planned so well that he and his secr et society could go underground if ever they were discovered. He con fidently stated, \"I have considered everything, and so prepared it, tha t if the Order should this day go to ruin, I shall in a year re-establish it m ore brilliant than ever.\" 18 To understand how the Illuminati concealed itself, the best method is to look at their own writings, confiscated by the B avarian government and published at that time. From these writings we know that secrecy was impressed upon the members known as adepts and init iates. They were never to be known as the Illuminati. Weishaupt used intrigue and masks to deceive those who might choose to know the true int ent of the Order of the Illuminati. The \"cover\" they chose to hide behind w as Freemasonry. In planning his disguise Weishaupt explained, \"We must consider how we can begin to work under another form. If only the aim i s achieved, it does not matter under what cover it takes place, and a cover is always necessary. 37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances For in concealment lies a great part of our strengt h.

The lodges that are under Freemasonry are...the most suitable cloak for our high purpose...A society concealed in this manner cannot be worked against. In case of a prosecution or of treason the superiors c annot be discovered...\" 19 The reason the Masonic Lodge was chosen was because it had become commonly accepted as a secret society. Weishaupt st ated, \"The great strength of our Order lies in its concealment; let it never appear in any place in its own name, but always covered by another name , and another occupation. None is fitter than the three lower deg rees of Free Masonry; the public is accustomed to it, expects little from it, and therefore takes little notice of it.\" 20 Weishaupt explained how the system would work: \"Tha t we shall have a masonic lodge of our own. That we shall regard th is as our nursery garden. That to some of these Masons we shall not a t once reveal that we have something more than the Masons have. That at e very opportunity we shall cover ourselves with this [Masonry]...All tho se who are not suited to the work shall remain in the masonic Lodge and adva nce in that without knowing anything of the further system.\" 21 According to some researchers, Freemasonry was used as more than simply a cover for the Illuminati. The French Freem ason and Illuminist, Mirabeau, disclosed that the Order of the Illuminat i actually arose out of Freemasonry! Mirabeau stated that the true reason f or the development of the Illuminati was that \"The Lodge Theodore de Bon Conseil at Munich, where there were a few men with brains and hearts, was tired of being tossed about by the vain promises and quarrels of M asonry.\" 22 In his Histoire de la Monarchic Prussienne, Mirabeau state d that in the very year that Illuminism was founded \"the heads resolved to graft on to their branch another secret association to which they gave the n ame of the Order of the Illumines (Illumined Ones). They modelled it on the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), whilst proposing to themselves views dia metrically opposed.\" 23 Nesta Webster in Secret Societies and Subversive Mo vements, says regarding Mirabeau, \"The Memoir found at his house was thus no other than the programme of the Illuminati evolved by him in collaboration with an inner ring of Freemasons belonging to the Lodge Theodore. The correspondence of the Illuminati in fact contains s everal references to an inner ring under the name of 'the secret chapter of the Lodge of St. Theodore.' \" 24 It would appear, then, that Weishaupt was likely t he agent 38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The Genesis of Communism - The Illuminati of more experienced conspirators, whose purely poli tical aims were disguised under a plan of social reform, and who sa w in the Bavarian professor a clever organizer to be employed in carr ying out their designs. Weishaupt, himself, became a Freemason in 1777 when he was initiated into the Lodge \"Theodore de Bon Conseil,\" at Munich . 25 This was after he had founded the Order of the Illuminati. Nesta Webs ter, a prolific writer on conspiracy theory suggested that, \"It is probable t hat Weishaupt was in touch with this secret chapter before his formal ad mission to the lodge.\" 26 However the symbiosis took place, in 1778, the idea was launched to formally join together Illuminism and Masonry. Weis haupt met Freiherr von Knigge and through their negotiations formed a union between the two societies. 27 The alliance was formerly sealed at the Congress o f Wilhelmsbad. This assembly met for the first time o n July 16, 1782 and represented no less than three million secret socie ty members all over the world. The Congress of Wilhelmsbad met with representative s from every country where Freemasonry existed (France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Holland, England, America etc.). With England's Duk e of Brunswick acting as Supreme Grand Master, 28 the decision was made to move the headquarters of \"Illuminized\" Freemasonry to Frankf urt, the stronghold of Rothschild finance. It was at this head lodge of Fr ankfurt that the gigantic plan of world revolution was prepared. All men at the Congress were under oath to reveal n othing of the real designs of the gathering. However, Comte de Virieu, a member of a Martinist Lodge at Lyons, France, lamented. \"I will not confide them [its secrets] to you. I can only tell you that all this is very much more serious than you think. The conspiracy which is being woven is so well thought out that it will be, so to speak, impossible for the Mo narchy and the Church to escape from it.\" From this time onwards, says his b iographer, M. Costa de Beauregard, \"the Comte de Virieu could only speak o f Freemasonry with horror.\" 29 Freiherr von Knigge and Adam Weishaupt had a fallin g out in 1783, and soon after public opinion was buzzing about the Illuminati. The Elector of Bavaria, informed of the danger to the State pub lished an edict forbidding all secret societies. In April of 1785, four other Illuminati members, having left the society in disgust at thei r leader's tyranny were summoned before a Court of Inquiry to give an accou nt of the doctrines and methods of the secret society. The evidence of these men left no further room for doubt as to the diabolical nature of Illum inism. \"All religion,\" 39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances they declared, \"all love of country and loyalty to sovereigns, were to be annihilated.\" 30 Initiation Dr. John Robison, in great alarm over the union bet ween Illuminism and Freemasonry attempted to expose this diabolical threat in 1798. In his book, Proofs of a Conspiracy, he shows how the Maso nic initiate gets moved up into the higher degrees and if considered one of the \"chosen ones\" — he may be invited to join the Illuminati. R obison explains that \"...should his Superiors judge more favorably of hi m, he is drawn out of the general mass of Free Masons, and becomes Illumi natus Minor...His superiors have already discovered what [his talents ] are, and know what service he may be capable of rendering the Order, p rovided he now heartily acquiesces in being thus honorably employed. They w ill assist him in bringing his talents into action, and will place hi m in the situations most favorable for their exertion, so that he may be ass ured of success.\" The aim of the Order is now more fully told him. It is, in one sentence, \"to make of the human race, without any distinction of nation, condition, or profession, one good and happy family.\" 31 To this aim every smaller consideration must give w ay. Robison stated: \"If the candidate, warmed by the alluring picture o f the possible happiness of a virtuous Society, says that he is sensible of the propriety of this procedure, and still wishes to be of the Order, he is required to sign the following obligation: 'I _____ protest before you, the worthy Plenipotent iary of the venerable Order into which I wish to be admitted, t hat I acknowledge my natural weakness and inability, and that I, with al l my possessions, rank, honors, and titles which I hold in political societ y, am, at bottom, only a man; I can enjoy these things only through my fello w-men, and through them also I may lose them. The approbation (approva l) and consideration on my fellow-men are indispensibly necessary, and I must try to maintain them by all my talents. These I will never use to t he prejudice of universal good, but will oppose, with all my might, the enemi es of the human race, and of political society...I bind myself to perpetu al silence and unshaken loyalty and submission to the Order, in the persons of my Superiors; here making a faithful and complete surrender of my priv ate judgment, my own will, and every narrow-minded employment of my power and influence.

He is threatened with unavoidable vengeance, from whic h no potentate can defend him, if he should ever betray the Order.\" 33 The initiator says to the candidate: \"If you are only a traitor and perjurer learn that all our brothers are called upon to arm themselves against you. Do n ot hope to escape or to find a place of safety. Wherever you are, shame, re morse, and the rage of our brothers will pursue you and torment you to the innermost recesses of your entrails.\" 34 Robison, himself a Freemason, asked, \"Can the perso n be called wise who thus enslaves himself? Such persons give up the right of private judgment, and rely on their unknown Superiors with the blindest and most abject confidence. For their sakes, and to rivet st ill faster their own fetters, they engage in the most corrupting of all employmen ts — and for what? — To learn something more of an order, of which every degree explodes the doctrine of a former one.\" 35 Weishaupt was a master at understanding the nature of men. In order to keep his initiates in line he used the age-old powe r of initiation by sworn oath. He veiled these oaths in mystery and bathed t hem with blood- curdling threats, not so different from those that even lesser Masons take today. By building on such sworn Masonic allegiance , Weishaupt was able to maintain control over his subjects. Weishaupt, who designed the various levels, derided the Mason: \"Of all the means I know to lead men, the most effectua l is a concealed mystery. The hankering of the mind is irresistible; and if o nce a man has taken it into his head that there is a mystery in a thing, it is impossible to get it out... What more contemptible than fanaticism; but call it enthusiasm; then add the little word noble, and you may lead him all over the world.\" 36 One of those who caught on to the trick was Freemas on Jim Shaw who wrote The Deadly Deception. After reaching the much sought-after 32nd Degree, Jim Shaw put it like this: \"Well, there it is. This absurd, disarticulated mix ture of silly contradiction, pagan blasphemy and unfilled promise is all they get.

After spending all t his money and effort to reach 'the Light,' they are told they are not there , that they must search farther and find it on their own. And they still do n't really know what it is! \"And these victimized men, 'ever learning, and neve r able to come to the knowledge of the truth,' don't even realize tha t they are victims. How very sad.\" 37 As in all secret societies, the Illuminati novice n ever understood the true nature of the organization to which an oath wa s required. As the Illuminatus Minor proceeded he learned only pieceme al about the Order he swore his life to. What he was not told is that the chief part of the Order is \"the rooting out of 'prejudices' in politics and re ligion.\" 38 Weishaupt used the Christian religion as the means for inviting Christians of every denomination in, but by gradual ly persuading them with flattery and promises he removed their Christi an doubts and landed them in Deism. 39 One of Weishaupt's disciples stated: \"Were I to le t them (the initiates) know that our General holds all Rel igion to be a lie, and uses even Deism, only to lead men by the nose. — Were I to connect myself again with the Free Masons, and tell them our desig ns to ruin their Fraternity... I could put it (Illuminism) on a resp ectable footing, and the world would be ours. [But] should I mention our fun damental principles, so unquestionably dangerous to the world, who would remain?\" 40 Thus, the Christian religion is used for concealment and as a \"cover\" to protect this Order of Wickedness. Weishaupt confidently wro te, \"I have so contrived things, that I would admit even Popes and Kings, after the trials which I have prefixed; and they would be glad to be of the Order.\" 41 After the initiate reached the higher grades, if he was deemed trustworthy; i.e., no security risk, he was told th e whole secret of the Order: \"Remember that from the first invitations which we have given you in order to attract you to us, we commenced by telling you that in the projects of our Order there did not enter any designs agains t religion.

Many \"Christi an\" clergy and teachers became initiates. Weishaupt counted on thi s \"illuminized\" clergy and \"illuminized\" teaching staff to do the work of the Order.

Weishaupt wrote, \"All the professors are members of the Illuminati...so will all the pupils become disciples of Illuminism. \" 52 It was not only important to Weishaupt but also amu sing to him that churchmen were being deceived as well. At one point Weishaupt gloated, \"You cannot imagine what consideration and sensatio n our Priest's degree is arousing.

By 1814, he had d eveloped a lengthy report on the secret societies of Germany in which he stated: \"...The Association always had a political tendency. If it still retains some mystic traits, it is in order to support itself at need by the power of religious fanaticism...\" 55 This purely religious fanaticism and its mystic fo rms were taken in order to conceal its principles and projec ts. Berckheim claimed that, \"The doctrine of Illuminism is subversive of every kind of monarchy; unlimited liberty, absolute levelling dow n, such is the fundamental dogma of the sect; to break the ties th at bind the Sovereign to the citizen of a state, that is the object of all i ts efforts.\" 56 The police commissioner continued: \"As the principa l force of the Illumines lies in the power of opinions, they have set themselves out from the beginning to make proselytes amongst the men wh o through their profession exercise a direct influence on minds, su ch as litterateurs (writers*), savants (learned ones*), and above all professors.

In a short ti me it made rapid progress, and although the Bavarian Government reco gnized the necessity of employing methods of repression against it the B avarian authorities \"could not eradicate the germ of evil.\" 59 In only a few years Illuminism multiplied its hotbe ds all through the south of Germany, and as a consequence Illuminism i nsinuated itself into Saxony, Prussia, Sweden, and even into Russia. 60 Soon, one or more lodges of the Illuminati were discovered in Munich, Ingols tadt, Frankfort, Austria (14 lodges), Heidelberg, Strasbourg (5 lodges), Dus seldorff, Cologne, Bonn (4 lodges), Alsace, Vienna (4 lodges), Stutgar d (3 lodges), Poland, England (8 lodges), Scotland (2 lodges), Aix-la-Cha ppelle (2 lodges), Switzerland (many), Rome, Naples, Florence, France, Dresden (4 lodges) and America (several). And this was before 1786! 61 Illuminism found adepts everywhere: in Holland, Belgium, Spain, Ital y, Switzerland, Sweden, Russia, even as far as Africa. 62 Dr. John Robison acknowledged with regret that a nu mber of British Masons were won over by the propaganda of the Germa n Illuminati. 63 One of these, Illuminist Cato-Zwack, had visited Englan d after his expulsion from Bavaria and spent a year at Oxford University.

It was largely due to the instrumentality of Paine that se veral \"illuminized\" lodges were started in England, which Robison, writing in 1797, declared to be still in existence. 64 Two years before the suppression of Illuminism in B avaria its members had already begun their work in France. A freemason and occultist named Cagliostro discovered that the Illuminati of which he was a member possessed huge amounts of money dispersed from the banks of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, London, Genoa, and Venice. 65 Cagliostro himself had been able to withdraw huge sums for the work of propaganda in France. All the revolutionary leaders of the French Revolution were members of the lodges. 66 Aloys Hoffman, editor of the Journal de Vienne, wrote: \"I shall never cease to repeat that the [Fre nch] Revolution has come from masonry and that it was made by writers and th e Illuminati.\" 67 The entire plan of the French Revolution was found with the papers of Mirabeau the French Freemason and Illuminist. This document, Croquis ou Projet de Revolution de Monsieur de Mirabeau, was s eized at the house of the wife of Mirabeau's publisher, October 6, 1789. It reads: \"We must overthrow all order, suppress all laws, an nul all power and leave the people in anarchy...We must caress their [the people's] vanity, flatter their hopes, promise them happiness... we m ust elude their caprices and their systems at will, for the people as legisl ators are very dangerous...As the people are a lever which legisla tors can move at their will, we must necessarily use them as a support, an d render hateful to them everything we wish to destroy and sow illusions in their path; we must also buy all the mercenary pens (press, media, publishin g*) which propagate our methods...The clergy...can only be destroyed by ridiculing religion, rendering its ministers odious, and only representi ng them as hypocritical monsters...Libels must at every moment show fresh t races of hatred against the clergy.

Our republican government wo uld be annihilated.\" 75 (Notice that all of our 20th century politicians us e the term \"democracy\" now. To them the annhilation of the republic is a f orgone conclusion.) Dr. John Robison summarized the objectives of this pernicious sect: \"The more closely we examine the principles and pra ctice of the Illuminati, the more clearly do we perceive that...Their first and immediate aim is to get the possession of riches, power, and influence, without industry; and to accomplish this, they want to abolish Christianity; and then dissolute (licentious) manners and universal profligacy (immo rality) will procure them the adherence of all the wicked, and enable th em to overturn all the civil governments of Europe; after which they will think of farther conquests, and extend their operations to the other quarters of the globe, till they have reduced mankind to the state of one undis tinguishable chaotic mass.\" This insidious plan for world conquest has n ot gone undetected. Nesta Webster in her book World Revolution said, \"C ommunistic theories had been held by isolated thinkers or groups of thi nkers since the days of Plato, but no one, as far as we know, had ever yet seriously proposed to destroy everything for which civilization stands.\" 77 In October, 1884, Monsignor George F. Dillon gave a series of lectures *Author's addition. 49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances in Edinburgh, Scotland, on \"The War of Antichrist W ith the Church and Christian Civilization.\" These lectures were publis hed in 1885 as a book entitled Grand Orient Freemasonry Unmasked as the S ecret Power behind Communism in which Father Dillon stated, \"Communism ...is but a form of the illuminated Masonry of Weishaupt.\" 78 Dillon was one who recognized that \"Illuminized Freemasonry\" had continued into t he 20th century with a new title and a new disguise, a new deceptive mask called \"Communism.\" Webster in World Revolution explained that, \"The Ru ssian Revolution from November 1917 onwards was a direct continuatio n of the French. This was admitted by the Bolsheviks themselves, who repeatedly declared that the first French Revolution must be copied in every detail...\" 79 A Russian who had been imprisoned under the Bolshevik s read Webster's book, The French Revolution. He wrote to her and sa id: \"Your book...seems to be the diary of our own revolution, so thoroughly well have our apes learnt their roles.. .\" 80 In our own time the plot has been stealthy and stea dy in the eroding of personal and national financial security. \"Socialis m,\" wrote the Bolshevist Lenin in May 1918, \"can only be reached by the deve lopment of State Capitalism, the careful organization of finance, co ntrol, and discipline amongst the workers.\" 81 Lenin also told us: \"The surest way to overthrow an established social order is to debauch its curre ncy.\" 82 Lenin's right-hand man, Bucharin explained that there would come a tim e when capitalism; i.e., sales and purchase would give way to barter. He indicated that, \"An 'exchange' of goods must then begin between town an d country, without the agency of money...when production and distribut ion are thoroughly organized, money will play no part whatever, and as a matter of course no kind of money dues will be demanded from anyone. Mo ney will have generally become unnecessary. Finance will become e xtinct.\" 83 Does it occur to the reader that someone actually knows wha t the plan for the future is? Could the cashless society actually be a form of Communist intrigue? H.G. Wells was an \"Insider\" thus his ability to for etell \"Insider\" plans for the future. In one of his articles on Communism he related that, \"Big business is by no means antipathetic to Communism. The larger big business grows the more it approximates to Collecti vism. It is the upper road of the few instead of the lower road of the ma sses to Collectivism.\" 84 The Illuminati plan was not to destroy finance only . To control a society one must destroy morality as well. It was t he Communist Bucharin who adopted the Marx aphorism that \"religion is opi um to the people.\" 50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"The Genesis of Communism - The Illuminati Bucharin proposed that mental degeneracy resulted f rom any religious beliefs and then declared \"Religion must be fought, if not by violence, at all events by argument.\" 85 Destroy finance, demean religion and God, and destr oy the family. This is the way the Illuminati determined to reduce the world to slavery. It was the English Socialist, Bertrand Russell who adm itted: \"It is necessary first to admit that children shoul d be delivered up almost entirely to the State. Nominally, the mother still comes to see her child in these schools, but in actual fact, the dra fting of children to the country must intervene, and the whole temper of the authorities seemed to be directed towards breaking the link between mothe r and child.\" 86 The following facts are undeniable: 1. \"That although the grievances of the people through out the past 300 years have varied according to the changing conditi ons of our civilization, the program of the social revolution has never varied... 2. \"That the leaders of the movement have never in a s ingle instance been men of the people but always members of the up per or middle classes who could not by any possibility be regarde d as victims of oppression... 3. \"That...they invariably display complete unconcern for the sufferings of the people and a total disregard for human life... 4. \"That each outbreak has occurred not when the cause of the people was hopeless but on the eve of great reforms. 5. \"That each [outbreak] has been followed not by refo rm but by a period of reaction... 6. \"That in spite of the fact that each outbreak has t hus thrown back the cause of the people, each has been represented to t he people as a step forward and further revolutions have been advocated .\" 87 The revolutionary movement of 1776 to the present d ay, therefore, has been the work of a continuous conspiracy working on ly for its own ends and against the interests of the world's people. 51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"3 A MERICAN F REEMASONRY - A C ONSPIRACY A GAINST M AN e have been told from authentic historical records that there was an Illuminati plan to enslave all mankind.

The Pennsylvania panel was infor med that a Master Mason promises under oath to protect the secrets of a brother Master Mason, \"murder and treason only excepted, and those at my own option.\" 13 The committee also learned that Masons influence j udicial decisions and consider Masonic oaths superior to al l other oaths. 14 These revelations only reaffirmed what had already been revealed previously in the Pennsylvania County Courts of the 5th Circuit in 1831 when there became reason to ponder the continuing p erversion of government: \"Have we then no reason to fear, that a similar conspiracy exists here; and that 'those who have turned the wo rld upside down, are come hither also?' As there seems to exist, in Amer ica, a spirit similar to that, which, in Europe, operated such fatal effects on Religion, Government, and Society; so it works by the same me ans, by secret societies, by the press, by occupying publications, and places of instruction.\" 15 Masonic influence in America and around the world l ed to the Masonic Congress of 1917 which supported the League of Nati ons and the Federation of the United States of Europe as well a s the World Court. Vicomte Leon De Poncins explains that \"all the conc lusions adopted in the course of these talks at the Masonic Congress in 19 17 became an integral part of the Treaty of Versailles two years later. M ost important of all was the setting-up of the League of Nations which...app ears to have been a kind of Masonic supra-State. \"Freemasonry was thus the chief beneficiary, in a p olitical sense, of the First World War. Hers were the principles and hers the men who were in charge of European politics from 1918 to 1930\" 16 De Poncins continues: \"The results were disastrous. The Treaty of Versailles quickly led to a widespread breakdown of order, to revoluti onary unrest, to the opposing reactions of the Fascist and Hitler regime s, to the Spanish Civil War, and finally to the Second World War.\" 17 He concludes, \"It is a frightening thought that an occult organization, ow ing responsibility to no one, can direct the course of European politi cs without anyone being aware nf the fact.\" 18 What few Americans understand is that this same occ ult organization was in virtual command of our own country at the sa me time.

As more evidence is un veiled, we begin to understand the bigger picture. Two Masonic promoter s of the Federal Reserve were: 1. Senator Robert L. Owen, the representative of the E uropean Rothschilds. In the senate, he drafted the Federal Reserve Act. 22 He received his Masonic degrees in Cherokee Lodge No. 10, Tahlequah, Oklahoma in 1881. He received his 32nd d egree on November 7, 1888. 2. Senator Nelson W. Aldrich, the maternal grandfather to the Rockefeller brothers. He was one of the secret plan ners of the Federal Reserve at Jekyll Island, Georgia. He was a member of What Cheer Lodge No. 21, Providence and Providence Chapter No. 1. In 1879, he was grand commander of the Grand Com mandery of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Many Americans are aware that it was through the \"N ew Deal\" policies of President Franklin D. Roosevelt that so cialism gained a stranglehold on this country. As indicated in previ ous Senate documentation, under Roosevelt a whole host of Comm unists entered the government. When the war broke out during his admin istration, the world- government-promoting Council on Foreign Relations w as made an adjunct of the U.S. Government. After the war, FDR brought Alger Hiss into government. Hiss was a known Communist and a member in good standing of the Council on Foreign Relations. That was no problem for FDR who proudly proclaimed that \"several of the bes t friends I've got are Communists.\" 23 James Warburg was another FDR appointee.

Wallace, vice-president to Franklin D. Roo sevelt, induced the Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Morgenthau, to pla ce the Great Pyramid of Giza on the then new 1935 dollar bill. Spenser s tates that Wallace had been drawn into contact with a Russian mystic in th e late 1920s named Dr. Nicholas Roerich. Roerich was an associate of the M oscow Art Theater. The Moscow Art Theater was considered a link to the Communist propaganda film machine known as \"The Cinema Bureau of the International Union of the Revolutionary Theatre.\" The idea of the \"Cinema Bureau\" was to revolutionize the American p eople through massive film brainwashing. Wallace associated with known Communists like Owen Lattimore for decades. His acceptance of them and by them eventually culminated in his becoming a candidate f or President as a member of the Progressive (Socialist) Party. 25 Now recall from Chapter 1 that it was while Henry M organthau was Secretary of the Treasury, that the identified Comm unist, Harry Dexter White, (Assistant Secretary of the Treasury) was gi ven \"full responsibility for Treasury's participation in all economic and fi nancial matters...\" 26 To understand how our president and vice-president could associate with known members of the Communist Party, one must begin to look beyond the political charade of smoke and mirrors w hich the media casts like shadows around its cherished leaders and co-co nspirators.

Chart er and the Statute of the International Court of Justice. The U.N. Charte r was written by Council on Foreign Relation members. In 1921 Chatham House (Great Britain) men, working with Robert Schuman and Paul Warburg i n America, began organizing the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), which would sit in New York, as the American end of a sort of internat ional political Masonry. On April 30, 1994, United Nations Article 92 made t he International Court an official part of the U.N. Charter. Two kno wn Communists — Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White (real name Dexter Weiss) were instrumental in the formation of the U.N. Both Hiss and White were Soviet agents and members of the Council on Foreign Relati ons. 30 The lawyers who deemed the United Nations constitut ional were also Council on Foreign Relations members. The Council o n Foreign Relations presently has complete control of the American stat e department and virtually all government-appointed positions as wel l as the military, media, banking, universities and colleges, publishing comp anies, judiciary (including the Supreme Court), and Fortune 500 comp anies.

When our \"masters\" talk ab out democracy, they are really talking about a Masonic Republic wh ich is quite different than a Constitutional Republic. The polite game of the \"brotherhood of man\" and the \"fatherhood of god\" goes on and on fro m generation to generation. They refer to each other as \"gentlemen\" but really they are universal traitors — traitors to every nation that they have ever entered. In 1976 many Masonic Congressmen were honored for thei r service to the Masonic Lodge. The ceremonies proclaimed that \"much credit must go to the Brethren in governmental positions.\" It was fur ther stated \"that good, dedicated, patriotic men can determine the fate of a nation and contribute to the fulfillment of Freemasonry's high ideals.\" Since we are indeed seeing the fate of our nation d etermined toward 69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances the totalitarian \"New World Order\", we can now unde rstand the requirement for the surreptitious nature of governm ent. Moreover, we can better understand why the Lodge advises its members , \"The less Masonic matters are discussed in public, the better for Mas onry.\" 47 The tentacles of the Masonic Lodge pervade society. A member of Freemasonry explained that there are at least 160 d ifferent organizations that require their members to be initiates into the Masonic Fraternity. 48 As far back as 1948, the Scottish Rite's New Age boast ed that nearly 10 million adults were linked directly, or were indire ctly associated with the nation's three million Master Masons. They estimate d that \"between one in five and one in 10 of the adult thinking population come directly within the circle of Masonic influence.. .\" 49 It becomes apparent that not only are our politicia ns, legislators, justices, governors, CEOs and even church leaders p redominately members of the Lodge, but so too are high ranking m embers of the military. A 1945 New Age editorial proudly proclaim ed that, \"...it is important that the officers of the Army and Marine Corps should be trained for their service in the Far East in institutions g uided by similar principles which accord with those things for which our Scotti sh Rite stands. This is true of California College in China, and I am glad that during 1945 we are to be training some 360 officers of the Army, and a comparable number of Intelligence officers of the Marine Corps.\" 50 Another report described 17 West Point graduates wh o one month before being commissioned as second lieutenants, we re \"obligated\" as \"soldier Masons...to carry out our [Masonry's] idea ls in Vietnam.\" Is this why we lost both the war and thousands of POW/MIAs? The ceremony's principal speaker was Lt. General Herman Nickerson, 33rd Degree Mason, Chief of Staff for Manpower and Director of Personn el of the U.S. Marine Corps. 51 During the Occupation of Japan at the close of Worl d War II, General MacArthur commented: \"Most of the Generals of the O ccupation and many men of lesser rank who were in key positions w ere Masons. The Japanese have since concluded that Masonry had some connection with the success of the Occupation.\" 52 Moreover, the Sovereign Grand Commander of the Scottish Rite pointed out that all except on e successor to General MacArthur as Far East Commander were \"active masons and members of the Scottish Rite.\" Those Scottish Rite officers we re General Matthew Ridgeway, General Mark Clark, General John Hull and General Lyman Lemnitzer. 53 70"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"American Freemasonry - A Conspiracy Against Man This may explain why we are reducing our military u nilaterally. It may also explain why we have destroyed our country's in dustrial base and millions of jobs in the process.

Yet, while the bases are closing, the military is d ownsizing, the planes are being scrapped, and the defense budget is reduced, Americans remain blissfully asleep. The Courts From the inception of the Supreme Court in 1789 unt il the year 1940, there was never a Masonic majority, although from 1 882 to 1887 and from 1921 to 1922, four Masonically-identified Justices sat on a nine-man bench. However, during the term of President Frankl in D. Roosevelt and continuing through the first few years of President Nixon's first term, members of the international secret society of Free masonry dominated the Supreme Court bench in ratios ranging from five to four in 1941 and from seven to two beginning in 1946. 54 From 1949 to 1956, seven members of Masonry served on the Court with a former Mason, Ju stice Sherman Minton. Masonic researcher and author, Paul Fisher has noted that \"...between 1941-1971, the Supreme Court was domina ted by Masons in ratios ranging from 5 to 4 (during the years 1941-1 946 and 1969-1971) to 8 to 1 (years 1949-1956).\" 55 In fact, one could argue that the Supreme Court was purposely \"stacked\" to promote Masonic pr eferences and prejudices. This would fit perfectly the plan laid out by Adam Weishaupt and the Illuminati. Dr. John Robison, the Edinburg scholar who exposed the Illuminati said that members of the Order of th e Illuminati \"insinuated themselves into all public offices, and particularl y into the courts of justice\" 56 By 1933 the Lodge was promoting the idea that \"Law is largely in the interpretation and not in the text...\" 57 Paul Fisher, in Behind The Lodge Door, states that the Masonic mode of interpreting the religion clause of the Constitution began in earnest as early as 1935. 58 In his January 6,1937, message to Congress, President Roosevelt, a 32nd de gree Mason, confirmed the need for an \"enlightened\" interpretat ion of the Constitution. He said, \"The vital need is not an alteration of ou r fundamental law, but an increasingly enlightened view in reference to it.\" 59 This \"enlightened view\" method of interpretation must be what was mea nt by Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes when he stated categorically: \"The Constitution 71"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances means what the Supreme Court says it means.\" 60 In 1941, another member of Masonry, Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson , wrote that the Constitution and its amendments \"are what the judge s sav they are.\" 61 So much for the Constitution! During these periods of Masonic dominance, the atte ntion of the Supreme Court became focused on religion-clause cas es. The verdicts in these cases, one after another, placed increasing r estrictions on the propagation of traditional religious values in the public arena. During the 30-year-period (1941-1971) with a Masonic majority, the Court erected \"a wall\" separating the religious from the secular. It was an epoch when prayer and Bible reading were erased from pubic edu cation and when decision after decision succeeded in prohibiting an y State financial assistance to religious schools. This was exactly w hat was intended. Paul Fisher suggests that since the decision to exc ise the Christian religion from society was ruled lawful, \"Masons hav e succeeded in having their religion dominate American society.\" 62 In fact, Fisher says, \"It is evident that international Freemasonry historically has been a revolutionary world-wide movement organized to adva nce Kabbalistic Gnosticism; to undermine and, if possible, to destr oy Christianity; to infuse Masonic philosophy into key government struc tures; and to subvert any government which does not comport with Masonic principles.\" 63 The Schools Freemasonry has always sought control over the mind s of our children. Historian Mildred Headings noted that the Masons su ccessfully promoted universal lay education in France and the use of sc hool texts with Masonic values. She said that the true purpose pursued by F rench Masons is \"the fall of all dogmas and the ruin of all churches.\" 64 In 1915, the Scottish Rite journal, the New Age urg ed its members that graduates of American public schools (as opposed to Catholic or Christian schools) be given \"preference in every appointment to public office.\" 65 Thereafter the Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite at a special session held in Colorado Springs, Colorado, developed a com prehensive education plan for the youth of our country. The desire was t o eliminate all Catholic or Christian \"sectarian propaganda.\" 66 The Scottish Rite plan urged the establishment of \"a national department of public e ducation headed by a secretary appointed as a member of the President's Cabinet.\" 67 The U.S. Commissioner of Education from 1921 to 1928 was a F reemason and a 72"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"American Freemasonry - A Conspiracy Against Man Rhodes scholar named John J. Tigert. His father was a Methodist bishop. Tigert became the president of Kentucky Wesleyan Co llege. 68 Many if not most of our college presidents have been members of the Lodge. From 1934 to 1948, the U.S. Commissioner of Educati on was John W. Studebaker. Studebaker had been superintendent of t he Des Moines school system from 1920-34 and later became vice-president and chairman of the editorial board of Scholastic Magazine. 69 By 1935, the Masonic goal to brainwash our children had yet to take effect. The Scottish Rite published an editorial in the New Age which explained the impediment to progress. The New Age n oted that eight of the fifteen members of the House Committee on Education were Roman Catholics. Because of this disgrace to the Lodge, t he Scottish Rite exclaimed: \"Hence, so long as this condition exists in Congress there will be little opportunity for creating a Department of Education.\" 70 Williard E. Givens became Executive Secretary of th e NEA in 1935 and held that position for 17 years! It was Givens who said that \"...the major function of the school is the social orientat ion of the individual. It must seek to give him understanding of the trans ition to a new social order.\" 71 Erminie King Wright, in an article on \"The Public School Monopoly,\" showed that \"When the program of Educati on For A New America was firmly established in the public school s and the NEA-control of education an undisputed fact, Willard E.

In 1936, Earl Warren, who at that time was Grand Ma ster of the Grand Lodge of California, stated to his Masonic brethren : \"...the education of our youth...can best be done, indeed it can only be done, by a system of free public education. It is for this reason that t he Grand Lodge of California, ever striving as it does to replace dar kness with light, is so vitally interested in the public schools of our sta te... \"By destroying prejudice and planting reason in its place it prepares the foundation of a liberty-loving people for free government.. .\" 74 Earl Warren was Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of California from 1935-1936.

He joined the Scottish Rite in 1919 and wa s wise master of the Rose Croix in 1938, venerable master of the Lodge o f Perfection in 1945 and received the honorary 33rd degree on December 2 3, 1941. He was governor of California from 1943-1953. As a 33rd de gree Mason he became Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in 1953. 75 It was the Warren Commission, named after the Chief Justice, which de termined that there was no conspiracy in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. During the reign of Harry S. Truman who was a 33rd degree Mason and a member of the Ararat Shrine Temple, A Report of the President's Commission on Higher Education was released in Dece mber of 1947. This report stated: \"There is urgent need for a program of education for world citizenship that can be made a part of every person 's general education.. .It will take social science and social engineering to solve the problems of human relations...The competitive principle must gi ve place to the principle of cooperation.. .East and West are comin g together in one world order. We could not stem this development if we wan ted to.\" 76 When the massive school building program was being launched early in the 1950s, Dr. James B. Conant, a member of the NEA's Educational Policies Commission and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, who had served the money interests in various capac ities for many years, was commissioned to tour the country in behalf of s chool consolidation. Consolidation of as many schools as possible would provide an excuse for a nationwide school construction program of such ma gnitude that bond issues would be the only means of financing it. Whi le providing tax- exempt incomes for the super-rich, the consolidatio ns would also take the schools away from the neighborhoods and the childre n away from their parents. Conant used Freemasonry as the most convenient and powerful vehicle available to do the job. A summary of Dr. Conant's recommendation was published in booklet form and sent out by the Supre me Council of the Scottish Rite to top leaders in 35 southern and wes tern states. 77 In addition, the Masonic New Age magazine published an article in March 1959 proposing that every Mason become a teac her of \"Masonic philosophy to the community.\" Moreover, the New Age writer, Dr. James D. Carter, said that the Lodge is \"the missionary o f the new order — a Liberal order...in which Masons becomes high priest s.\" 78 This New Order had become a reality, said the Scottish Rite publication, by \"the establishment of the public school system, financed by the State, for the combined purpose of technological and sociological education of the 74"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"American Freemasonry - A Conspiracy Against Man mass of humanity, beginning at an early age in chil dhood.\" 79 What this means is that the great mass of humanity is being p urposely brainwashed! One of the ways in which society has been properly brainwashed by educational thought control is by the promotion of the unprovable — evolution. Naturally, the Masonic Supreme Court vot ed out all sense of God's intervention in the creation of the world. No t so surprisingly, in 1968 a 33rd degree Mason said, \"The keynote of Masonic r eligious thinking is naturalism which sees all life and thought as ever developing and evolutionary.\" 80 This is the reason for the pervasive mind control being secretly perpetrated on our seduced public school c hildren. The Scottish Rite applauded its members for the fin e job they have done promoting public school secularization of our child ren. The New Age informed its brethren that, \"Through the activities of our state organizations, the New Age Magazine, our clip service and News Bur eau, we are stimulating the public interest and furnishing much valuable material to speakers and writers, and thereby can reasonably cl aim much credit\" for the growing interest in favor of compulsory education b y the state.\" 81 How far are we with the state-run propaganda machin e? At an Association for Childhood Education International s eminar in Denver recently, Dr. Chester M. Pierce of Harvard Universi ty told the attending teachers that \"every child in America entering scho ol at the age of five is insane because he comes to school with certain alle giances toward our founding fathers, toward his parents, toward a beli ef in a supernatural being, toward the sovereignty of this nation as a s eparate entity.. .It's up to you teachers to make all of these sick children wel l by creating the international children of the future.\" 82 If you are only now gearing up to get into the educ ational battle take careful note that the January/February issue of The Humanist already informed us: \"The crazies [fundamentalists] don't d o all that much reading. If they did, they'd find that they have already bee n defeated.\" 83 Consider if you can, that this was written in 1976! Few Chri stian families realize that humanists truly believe that, \"Any child who believ es in God is mentally ill.\" 84 The legacy of Masonic control over the school syst em speaks volumes in a society which can neither read nor wri te, think nor analyze; a society which foments destruction and anarchy under the guise of liberalism and a society in which the Harvard and Y ale elite are none the wiser. Indeed, it seems incredible what the disciples of F reemasonry have accomplished. Moreover, they are proud to accept th e responsibility for 75"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances what they have done. The New Age wrote many years a go (September, 1950): \"The great American public schools pave the way for the new race, the new religion, and a new civilization.. for the dawn of the New Age of the world.\" 85 That is exactly what George Bush described as the New World Order! Our American History Our first President was a Mason, sworn into office by the Grand Master of New York on a Bible taken from a Masonic Altar, that of St. John's Lodge No.1.

The Bible used in the ceremony was brought there by General Morton , Marshal of the day from St. John's Lodge, of which he was Worshipful M aster.. .Thus was laid the cornerstone of our country and forever Washingt on — the Mason who exemplified in his every act and deed the principle s of Masonry — will stand as the strong foundation of our Government.\" 86 This same bible used for Washington's inauguration was used to swear in Masonic Presidents Warren Harding in 1921 and Dwight Eisenhower in 195 3. 87 The Masonic Messenger article also said that, \"The selection of Washington's Cabinet would make up another thrillin g Masonic story. It is especially noteworthy that Edmund Randolph, the fir st Attorney General, was serving as Grand Master of Virginia when he iss ued the charter to Alexandria Lodge with Washington as its first Maste r.\" 88 Masonic particulars were all around Washington. Not ably, many highborn European revolutionaries rushed to help fi ght in the revolutionary war. Men like the Marquis de la Fayette, Count de R ochambeau, Count de Grasse, Thaddeus Kosciuszko, Count Pulaski, Baron J ohann de Kalb and Baron von Steuben. Count Pulaski actually brandishe d a Masonic battle flag in the field. The flag sported the All-Seeing Eye a nd Triangle of the Lodge. 89 Thirty-three of General Washington's generals were Masons. 90 The Marquis de la Fayette admitted that Washington entr usted no serious duties to him until he had been inducted into Masonry. 91 The Marquis stated that, \"After I was made a Mason, General Washington seeme d to have received a new light. I never from that moment had any cause to doubt his entire confidence. It was not long before I had a separate command of great importance.\" 92 Benjamin Franklin was the leader of the first Mason ic press.

As a Mason Franklin served twice as Provincial Grand Master of Pennsylvania and later for two years as Worshipful Master of the fam ous French revolutionary Lodge of the Nine Muses. 93 It was here in Paris, that Franklin introduced the revolutionary philosopher a nd writer Voltaire into the Masonic Lodge of the Nine Muses. 94 This was the same Voltaire who said, \"I am weary of hearing people repeat that twe lve men have been sufficient to establish Christianity, and I will pr ove that one man may suffice to overthrow it.\" 95 Franklin was a devoted student of Alchemy. A prayer composed by him reads, \"God grant, that not only the love of liberty, but a thorough knowledge of the rights of man, may pervade all the nations of the earth, so that a philosopher may set his foot anywhere on its surface and say, 'This is my country.' \" 96 This is quite simply, global naturalism! In the book Facts for Freemasons by 33rd degree Mas on Harold V.B. Voorhis, the question is asked, \"Who did more to es tablish Freemasonry in America during Colonial times than any other of his time?\" The answer: \"Benjamin Franklin.\" 97 The only Catholic to sign the Declaration of Indepe ndence was Charles Carroll. His cousin, Daniel Carroll signed the Arti cles of Confederation and the Constitution. Even though the Catholic Chur ch strongly condemned Masonry, Daniel received the degree of En tered Apprentice in May, 1780, and in May, 1781 became a Master Mason. 98 Ten years later he officiated as Commissioner at the Masonic ceremony laying the cornerstone of the new U.S. Capitol. 99 He also officiated at the laying of the cornerstone of the District of Columbia in 1791 ! 100 Virtually all of the Hellenistic architecture of Wa shington, D.C.; e.g., the Lincoln Memorial, the Jefferson Memorial, the W ashington Monument and the White House have been dedicated by Masonic ceremonies. A Masonic Service Association pamphlet informs us tha t the capital's three most important monuments — the Capitol, the White H ouse and the Washington Monument — were \"all three begun under M asonic auspices; all three had cornerstones laid by Masonic hands; a ll three have Masonic associations which are a part of history, and the f irst of its forty cornerstones marking the boundaries of the District of Columbia...was also Masonically laid.\" (James Hobran, architect of the White House, was the first Master of Federal No. 1, Grand Lodge of t he District of Columbia.) 101 The very design of the city of Washington, D.C. wa s laid out 77"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances in Masonic symbolism; the streets lay out the squar e and compass of Freemasonry.

The prayer room which was set up in the Senate in 1954 depicts Washington deep in prayer before the Great Seal of the United States. 103 Above him is the occultic pyramid surmounted by the eye of Horus whi ch constitutes the seal of Masonry and the Illuminati. 104 As early as 1926, the Scottish Rite's New Age encou raged its members to be active in Christian churches. Every member of the secret society, declared the New Age, \"should cast his lot with the Church — to help vitalize it, modernize it and render it aggressive and efficient — to do less is treason to your country, to your Creator, and to the obligation vou have promised to obey.\" 105 Since the Church has posted virtually no resistenc e to modernism, it would seem that the Lodge has agai n been successful. The churches of today have been modernized to such a st ate of lukewarmness that their saltiness tastes like bath water. For those who assert that this has always been a \"C hristian\" country, 33rd Degree Mason, Harry L. Baum disclosed in 1950 the Masonic brotherhood's attitude toward Christianity: \"Any teaching which is completely antagonistic (lik e true Christianity) to all that we consider sacred, in re ligion, in morals and in government, is subversive of those fundamentals, an d on them we depend for our very existence as a Craft. Our first duty, therefore, becomes one of self-preservation, which includes defense of those principles for which we stand and by which we live. This duty cannot be dis charged by complete silence on the subject, and this view, it is encour aging to note, is today shared by most of those who speak Masonically in th e United States.\" He concluded by demonstrating how the principles of Freemasonry supersede the principles of the U.S. Constitution: \"This nation was nurtured on the ideals of Freemaso nry...most of those who are today its leaders are also members an d leaders of the 78"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"American Freemasonry - A Conspiracy Against Man Craft.

The National Council of Churches is the outgrowth o f the extremely liberal Federal Council of Churches of which S. Par kes Cadman was president from 1924-1928. Cadman was a member of In dependent Royal Arch Lodge No. 2, New York City, and grand chaplain of the Grand Lodge of New York for 28 years. William R. Denslow, in hi s broad compilation 10,000 Famous Freemasons says, Cadman \"was noted fo r his broad and liberal attitude with regard to the religious opini ons of others.\" 109 Eduard C. Linderman, an editor and a member of the Federal Council [of Churches] Commission on Research in 1939 and 1940 p roclaimed: \"The Christian religion is not a suitable religion for t oday.\" 110 In every country of the world where the Masonic Lod ge has gained control over legislation, the primary law put into place has been the separation of church and state. Even nominal Cathol ic John F. Kennedy when campaigning for the Presidency, adhered to thi s Masonic doctrine when he said in Houston, Texas: \"I believe in an Am erica where the separation of Church and state is absolute...\" 111 Following suit, two days before Christmas, 1994, Ju dge Albert V. Bryan, Jr. ruled in Alexandria, Virginia, that stud ent-led ceremonies the spring before had violated the constitutional separ ation of church and state. (Banned according to the 1962 \"interpretation\" of t he Masonically- dominated Supreme Court.) Judge Bryan's ruling was in response to a lawsuit filed by the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) and the ASCS (Americans United for the Separation of Church and State). Bryan has Masonic ties and the ASCS is supported by the S cottish Rite and the New Age movement. ASCS Executive Director, Dr. Glen n Archer and Associate Director, Dr. C. Stanley Lowell are both 33rd degree Masons.

[It] is [part of] the continuing and ancient charm of the age-old rituals and rites.\" 113 The fact is, however, that many Masons themselves don't realize what they are involved in. One must understand that , \"Freemasonry is a fraternity within a fraternity — an outer organizat ion concealing an inner brotherhood of the elect.. .It is necessary to esta blish the existence of these two separate yet independent orders, the one visibl e and the other invisible... In each generation, only a few are acc epted into the inner sanctuary of the Work...The great initiate-philosop hers of Freemasonry are masters of that secret doctrine which forms the invisible foundations of every great theological and rational institution.\" 114 How many Masons do you suppose know the true purpose of the Masonic Or der? The New Age of August, 1962, explained the real function of the Lodge: \"Masons set the basic policies of our society. Yet the order is not political, and its purposes are not public. It is RELIGIOUS.\" 115 Pope Pius XI, in the early part of this century, ca utioned that \"...the secret societies, always ready to support war again st God and the Church...will certainly bring all nations to disast er. Thus this new form of atheism claims that there will be neither peace nor welfare on earth until the last remnant of religion has been torn up, and until its last representative has been crushed out of existence.\" 116 Although denied vehemently by the lower level brethren, from both i ts own authorities and foes alike we are told that Masonry is very much ab out religion. The question then becomes what is this religion that ou r presidents, congressmen, senators, justices, military men, and business leaders are into? 80"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"4 F REEMASONRY AND THE O CCULT - A C ONSPIRACY A GAINST G OD n 1945, a Masonic document, La Massoneria, was publ ished in Florence, Italy, demonstrating the occultic charact er of Freemasonry.

This secret doctrine, or gnosi s, belongs exclusively to the High, or philosophic, degrees of Freemasonry .\" 3 The truth is, however, that there is evidence that long before 1717, Freemasonry was one of several secret societies whi ch opposed all that Western Civilization stands for. In 1881, the work Les Societes Secretes et la Societe by Reverend N. Deschamps appeared, and w as touted as \"one of the most comprehensive and well-documented studies of Freemasonry that has ever been written.\" 4 Les Societes Secretes et la Societe has been calle d \"incomparably the best general survey of the anti-C hristian and revolutionary activities of Freemasons and kindred societies in all countries during the past two centuries.\" 5 Reverend Deschamps indicates that as far back as \"... 1535, we come across a doc ument which reveals the existence of an order, under the name of Freemasons , whose anti-Christian principles are absolutely in harmony with those of modern Masonry.\" 6 This ancient Masonic document known as the Charter of Cologne revealed that Gnostic anti-Christian influences had been nur tured through several secret societies. 7 Gnosticism is the doctrine of salvation by knowledg e, that is, knowledge of the mysteries of the Universe and of m agic formula indicative of that knowledge. It echoes Eden and ma n's desire to be a god. (Genesis 2:17, 3:4-7) This knowledge involves man's refusal to recognize his status as a created being who is subject to his Creator. Consid ered an early Church heresy, gnosticism was widespread throughout the Ro man world in the first centuries of Christianity and the Fathers of the Ch ristian Church fought relentlessly against it.

They were a peril no less ominous to Christianity and were perhaps more of a danger than those whose attack was obvious. At that time, the gnostic heresy was considered to be an oriental theosophy of unorthodox Jewish or igin. 8 One of its most formidable opponents was St. Irenaeus. 9 W.L. Wilmshurst, in The Masonic Initiation, admitte d that \"Freemasonry is the revival of the ancient Gnosis, the notorious heresy which was a synthesis of the pagan theosophies, aga inst which the early Fathers of the Church waged such a bitter struggle. \" 10 Oswald Wirth, a 33rd degree Freemason and a member of the Grand Lodge of France, wrote: \"The object of the ancient mysteries was to make men like unto gods...Raised above the level of man' s animal nature, the Builder.. .himself becomes a god.. .\" 11 Masonic guru Albert Pike revealed that, \"The Gnosti cs derived their leading doctrines and ideas from Plato and Philo; t he Zendavesta of the Persians; the Kabbalah of the Hebrews; and the sacr ed books of Egypt and India and thus introduced in the early days of Chri stianity, that which formed a large part of the ancient teachings of the Orient.\" 12 Pike says, \"Masonry is the descendant of that higher science h eld by the ancient teachers of those ancient religions that once illum inated the minds of men.\" 13 Pike explains that, \"This science was known as the Gnosis.\" 14 The Grand Master of the Johannine rite of Austrian Freemasonry asserted that \"the direct aim of Freemasonry is to bring its own members to the 'Gnosis', as being the only possible method of attaining the Divine Essence...\" 15 This \"gnosis\" has as its principal dogma - Panthei sm - through which man acquires the knowledge of the ide ntity of his own being with the divine being. \"Gnosis,\" then, become s the only true science. 16 Masonic author Oswald Wirth believed that man, by giving free reign to his noblest aspirations, is on the path to achieving his own divinity, without the help of any divine power outside of him self.

It is no wonder that Paul the apostle warned us: \"O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding the profa ne novelties of words, and oppositions of knowledge (gnosticism*), falsely so called. Which some promising, have erred concerning the faith.\" ( 1 Timothy 6:20,21.) J.D. Buck, a Masonic authority of the 32nd degree g ives us a new twist on the scriptures in his book, Symbolism or Mystic Masonry. Buck says, \"Salvation by faith and the vicarious atonement wer e not taught, as now interpreted, by Jesus.. .these doctrines.. .are lat er and ignorant perversions of the original doctrines. In the Early Church, as in the Secret Doctrine, there was not one Christ for the whole world, but a potential Christ in every man. Theologians first made a fetish of the I mpersonal, Omnipresent Divinity; and then tore the Christos from the heart s of all humanity in order to deify Jesus; that they might have a God-man pecu liarly their own!\" 21 (Italics by Buck.) Later, on page 61, Buck explains that \"Humanity in toto, then, is the only Personal God; and Christos is the realization, or perfection of this Divine Persona, in Individual conscious experience. When this perfection is realized, the state is called Christos, with the Greeks, and Buddha, with the Hindoos...\" 22 (Italics by Buck.) Buck continues: \"It will be urged by Modern Theolog ians that this view dethrones Christ. To this objection the answer is that any other view orphans Humanity. It is far more important that men should strive to become Christs than that they should believe that J esus was Christ... \"Jesus is no less Divine because all men may reach the same Divine perfection...salvation and perfection are synonymou s. It has also been shown that every act in the drama of the life of Je sus, and every quality assigned to Christ, is to be found in the life of K rishna and in the legend of all the Sun-Gods from the remotest antiquity. \"That which the orthodox Christian will find to opp ose to this view is not that it dethrones or degrades Christ, but that it disproves the idea of Christ as their exclusive possession, and denies th at all other religions are less Divine than their own.. .This idea of Universa l Brotherhood...was a cardinal doctrine in the Ancient Mysteries.. .\" 23 Now we understand how Communists can be presented a s part of the \"Universal Brotherhood\" under the \"Fatherhood of Go d.\" It is because as *Author's addition. 84"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Freemasonry and the Occult Buck admits, \"Humanity, in toto... is the personifi cation of the Divine in Creation... \"24 Despite Buck's assertions that \"at the heart of eve ry great religion, lie the same eternal truths\" and that \"the candidate is taught, not merely to tolerate another's religion, but to respect it as h is own,\" and that \"Masonry is the Universal Religion.. .as it embraces all rel igions,\" he realizes that ultimately the conflict between the doctrine of \"gn osis\" (i.e., men becoming gods) vs. the religion of the Christian fa ith as proclaimed by St. Paul, \"is war to the death.\" 25 The idea of man being God is sloppy ridiculousness to the true believer. This concept r epresents the opposite pole from Christianity; rather, \"From a Christian p oint of view, the Freemasons represent human pride, the spirit of evi l, the revolt against God.\" 26 German writer, Baron von Stotzingen, calls Masonry' s essence — the \"worship of humanity.\" He explains that, \"In the la st analysis, the leaders of Freemasonry mean.. .that man is his own master a nd that there exists no authority either below or above him. Expressed in a nother way, Humanism means the moral and spiritual autonomy of a mankind liberated from any superior authority; this is fund amental to all true Freemasonry. \"In this conception, of course, no place is left fo r a personal God outside this world. Nor can there be room for any f orm of stable government, resting on a divine basis. Carried to i ts extreme, this idea must end in total anarchy, and in the war of every man f or himself against all his neighbors. For without a moral order resting on a divine basis, no legal, social or political form has any real foundation.\" 27 \"It is true that in many countries Freemasonry does not draw the fundamental conclusions from its own basic principl es. In any case, most Freemasons have no suspicion of what those conclusi ons would be. But this in no way affects the root of the problem. \"When the essence of Freemasonry is defined in this way, we can easily understand why it has such affinities with L iberalism. We can say that Freemasonry is organized Liberalism. Liberalis m's general staff. Nevertheless, Liberalism confines itself to recogni zing the Humanist principle, but rejects its consequences. Socialism, the heir to Liberalism, is much more logical...\" 28 Baron von Stotzingen shows further that, \"The spiri tual relationship which links Freemasonry with Liberalism and Sociali sm explains the apparently astonishing fact that the rich Freemason or Liberal is found, in 85"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances spite of everything, in the same camp as the workin g-class Socialist — at war with the Conservative conception of the world.\" 29 Radical leftist Antonio Gramsci in May 1916 remarke d: \"Socialism is precisely the religion that must overwhelm Christia nity.\" In The New Order, Marxist Gramsci explained that Socialism wou ld triumph by first capturing the culture via infiltration of schools, universities, churches and the media by transforming the consciousness of soci ety. 30 Being at war with conservatism means developing sub terfuge to undermine the enemy. In 1975 Pravda, of Bratislava, Czechoslovakia explained in an editorial: \"A Socialist State canno t content itself with simply granting freedom of worship to those who pro fess a religious faith nor simply give freedom of expression to those who are atheists, it has the duty of forming the consciousness of the people in order to bring them into harmony with Socialism so that they are able t o perceive the world and themselves in the world as full, active participant s in the great historical undertaking which is the formation of the Communist Society.\" 31 Perhaps now it is not so surprising to learn that \" Communism was handed down in the dark through the secret societie s\" of the nineteenth century. 32 In fact, long ago it was said by Malapert, the ora tor of the Supreme Council of the Ancient and Accepted Scottis h Rite that, \"In the eighteenth century Freemasonry was so widespread th roughout the world that one can say that since that epoch nothing has been done without its consent.\" 33 Even the Communist Manifesto owes its development t o the secret societies. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels were comm issioned to write the Communist Manifesto. The preface to the 1888 Englis h edition reveals that the Manifesto was published as the platform of the Communist League [which was] before 1848 unavoidably a secret societ y. 34 Marx tells us, \"Before anything else, we must rid o urselves of this myth about God. I will never weary of repeating: Go d is the great evil. It is the ghost of God which prevents us from carrying through to the very end of our efforts to bring into existence that vis ion of which religion is only an abortive dream: the reign of justice and ha ppiness, paradise upon earth.\" 35 Here is demonized Karl Marx promoting an earthly U topia. Marx continued, \"The number one exploiter, capitali st and robber of humanity is God. He it is who is the foundation and moral source of every inequality and evil that exists.

Greeley was a member of the Columbian Lodg e of the Order of the Illuminati established in New York in 1785. 38 Socialist fellow- revolutionaries of Marx actually participated in Am erica's Civil War! One such man was Joseph Weydemeyer a former Prussian ar tillery officer who helped form the Workingmen's League. He became a co lonel in the Union army. 39 In a letter to Weydemeyer written in 1852, Marx ex plained that \"bourgeois society in the United States has not yet developed far enough to make the class struggle obvious and comprehensib le.\" 40 In 1958, the IVth Inter American Conference of Free masonry was held in Santiago, Chile. It was here that the Order of F reemasonry formally declared \"Marxism and Freemasonry both serve the co mmon ideal of earthly happiness...A Freemason can accept complete ly the philosophical conceptions of Marxism. No conflict is possible bet ween the philosophical conceptions of Marxism and Freemasonry.. .\" 41 The United States of America was founded upon Freem asonry. Many of the signers of the Constitution were Freemasons. The American Revolution, in fact, was funded by France because o f the influence of Benjamin Franklin upon the Masonic Lodges of France and their influence, in turn, on the French king and citizenry. Thus, in The Secret Destiny of America, Manley P. Hall says: \"...I dedicate this b ook to the proposition that American Democracy is part of a Universal Plan .\" 42 Years of research...has convinced me that there exists in th e world today, and has existed for thousands of years, a body of enlighten ed humans united in what might be termed, an Order of the Quest.

Hall says, \"Not only must we preserve that which we have gained through ages of striving, we must also perfect the plan of the ages, setting up here the machinery for a world brotherhood of nations an d races.\" 44 Thirty-third degree Freemason and satanist, Manley P.

H istorian Mildred Headings showed that Masons influenced at l east 47 periodicals throughout France, off an on, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 54 In the United States in 1920, the Scottish Rite es tablished a news service for \"furnishing accurate and gratuitou s information to newspapers.\" 55 In 1924, the Grand Commander informed the Masonic Brethren: \"Through the activities of our state orga nizations, the New Age Magazine, our clip service and News Bureau, we are stimulating the public interest and furnishing much valuable material to s peakers and writers, and thereby can reasonably claim much credit\" for the g rowing interest in favor of compulsory education by the state. 56 In 1926, the Grand Commander reported, \"...it is safe to claim that the majority of daily publications seem very friendly in their attitude toward the Craft.\" 57 The July 1928 New Age reported that \"many members of the National Press C lub are Masons, not a few of them very prominent Masons.\" 58 Prominent Masons in the media included: Charles P.

Our human \"Masters\" like the Wizard of Oz have crea ted enough confusion and fear to actually develop a people who will acce pt a Modern Babylon. Manly P. Hall in The Secret Destiny of America stat es: \"Wise men, the ancients believed, were a separate race, and to be born into this race it was necessary to develop the mind to a state of enl ightened intelligence. The old philosophers taught that physical birth is an accident, for men are born into various races and nationalities according to the laws of generation; but there is a second birth, which is n ot an accident; it is the consequence of a proper intent. By this second birt h man is born by enlightened intelligence out of nation and out of r ace into an international nation and an international race. It is this larger and coming race that will some day inherit the earth. B ut unless a man be born again by enlightenment, he shall not be a part of the philosophic empire.\" 62 Mind you, this is not Billy Graham, this is 33rd d egree Mason and Satanist, Manly P. Hall! Manley P. Hall describes Plato as a good example of one of these \"bora again enlightened ones.\" He says, \"Plato...was a mo narchist by philosophic conviction, but his ideal king was the wise man perfect in the virtues and the natural ruler of those less informe d than himself. This king was descended of a divine race: that is, he belonge d to the Order of the Illumined (Illuminati); for those who come to a sta te of wisdom then belong to the family of the heroes — perfected huma n beings.\" 63 Secret Counter-Church Deschamps tells us that Freemasonry, since 1535, ek ed out a clandestine existence throughout the various States of Europe, in direct antagonism with the religious and civil principles that formed Western civilization.

Thus seeing that Freemasonry, so apparently insigni ficant, was turning itself into some sort of society entirely devoted t o good works and charity, the powers of this world believed that in fact reli gion and politics were not connected with it. The paradoxical situation which this attitude produced serves as a protective veil under which Freemasonry can act everywhere in shadow and in secret, in order to attain its tru ly sublime ends.\" 68 An ex-Mason J.

The only truths revealed ar e those which will deceive the lower level Mason. Pike revealed in Mor als and Dogma that, \"The symbols and ceremonies of Masonry have more th an one meaning. They rather conceal than disclose the Truth. They h int [at] it only...\" 75 Pike admitted: \"Masonry, like all the Religions, al l the Mysteries, Hermeticism and Alchemy, conceals its secrets from all except the Adepts and Sages, or the Elect, and uses false explanation s and misinterpretations of its symbols to mislead those who deserve only to be misled...\" 76 * Yet many dupes of Masonry believe that the lodge is a Christian organization.

One of the lodge's theologians stated: \"To enter ou r Lodges a man must confess his faith in God — though he is not require d definitely to define in what terms he thinks of God.. .\" 77 To really understand Freemasonry, one must look fur ther into its esteemed Sovereign — Albert Pike. A short history i s pertinent: Pike was born in Boston, Massachusetts on December 29, 1809. He was educated at Harvard. 78 Pike moved to Little Rock, Arkansas in 1833 and as a young man became president of the State Co uncil of the anti- Catholic American Party. 79 In the 1840s, he joined the Order of Oddfellows, a secret society and in 1850, he became a member of the Masonic Fraternity and was initiated in the Western Star Lodge, Little Rock, Arkansas. 80 In 1855, Pike spoke at the national convention of t he Nativist American Republican Party, of which he was an offic ial. Several weeks earlier, on April 30, as President of the Arkansas State Council of the Know-Nothing Party he said he was fearful of foreig n-born voters, who he identified as predominately Catholic. 81 The New York Daily Times stated that the Know-Nothing Movement \"rests partly upon h ostility to Roman Catholicism.\" 82 In 1858 Pike clarified his own religious beliefs: \" There is no...independent and self-existent Evil Principle i n rebellion against God.. .Evil is merely apparent; and all is in reali ty good and perfect.\" *Italics are Albert Pike's own emphasis in Morals a nd Dogma. 93"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances In 1859 Pike was elected Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supreme Council for the Southern Jurisdiction of th e United States at Charleston, South Carolina. 83 Edith Starr Miller, in her lengthy treatise on secret societies, Occult Theocracy, says that, \"As a consequence of the intrigues and maneuvers of some members of the Maso nic organization, the office of Grand Master had become an elective p osition which was now destined to be filled by the particular member of t he Fraternity selected by the conspirators. Among the conspirators was Gallat in Mackey, a Luciferian, who proposed Albert Pike, another Lucif erian, for the post of Grand Master of the Supreme Council of Charleston t o which he was duly elected on January 6th, 1859, his candidacy being u nopposed.\" 84 She also indicates that Pike from Charleston and Mazzini fro m Italy formed the constitution of central high masonry dated Septembe r 20,1870. 85 This was the exact same day as the invasion of Rome by the F reemason, General Cadorna, and the abolition of the temporal power of the Pope. 86 Pike was given the job to draw up the grades of the Supreme Secret Rite which would be the liturgic bonds of the members of centr alized high masonry. The new order was named the New and Reformed Pallad ian Rite. \"It was agreed that the existence of this rite would be kep t strictly secret and that no mention of it would ever be made in the assembli es of the Lodges and Inner Shrines of other rites...\" 87 \"To recruit adepts, they planned to use some members of the other rites, but in the beginni ng they meant to rely principally on those among the initiates of Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rites who were already addicted to occultism.\" 88 In Occult Theocracy it is explained that, \"...Palladism is essentially a Luci ferian rite. Its religion is Manichean neo-gnosticism.. .\" 89 \"Palladism is superposed to all the other rites. Being the real hidden power, known only to t he perfect initiates, it need not unveil itself.. .\" 90 Albert Pike established the New and Reformed Pallad ian Rite in 1886. In the reception of the Elect of the Reformed Palla dium Rite, those who are to be initiated are taught to punish the traitor Je sus Christ and to kill Adonai, the God of the Bible, through the power of their own evil, done first by Master then by the initiate, piercing the host with a dagger, in the midst of horrible blasphemies, after they have been assured that it is a consecrated host. 91 According to William Guy Carr, author of Red Fog Ov er America, in the 1870s Pike revised and modernized the ritual of the Black Mass celebrated to emphasize the Luciferian and Satanic victory achieved in the Garden of Eden and over Christ to end his mission o n earth. This ceremony 94"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Freemasonry and the Occult included the desecration of a Host consecrated by a Roman Catholic Priest.

Pike, the Sovereign Pontiff of Lucifer, was the pre sident of the Supreme Dogmatic Directory, composed of ten brothers of the highest grades who formed his Supreme Grand College of Emeritus Masons . The Sovereign Executive Directory of High Masonry was established at Rome.\" 93 Pike and Mazzini established four Grand Central Dir ectories for the world, functioning thenceforth to gather information for t he benefit of their political policy and dogmatic propaganda. These wer e: The Grand Central Directories for North America at Washington, for So uth America at Montevideo, for Europe at Naples, and for Asia and Oceania at Calcutta. Later, a central Sub-Directory for Africa was found ed at Port Louis, Island of Mauritius and a Universal Sovereign Administrati ve Directory at Berlin.\" 94 The author of Occult Theocracy seems to have under stood how the system worked. She explained, \"As everything co mes to the Grand Central Directories so everything emanates from the m. Five messages to Washington, Montevideo, Naples, Calcutta, and Port Louis will put in motion the formidable machinery of Freemasonry the world over.\" 95 Edith Starr Miller also informs us as do other writ ers of this era, that, \"It is a fact that for a certain length of time Maz zini and Marx were closely associated.\" 96 As a matter of fact, although Marx is often consid ered one of the leaders of the Communist Internationale, Nes ta Webster, in World Revolution, informs us that Marx played no part at all. \"I was present,\" he wrote Engels, \"only as a dumb personage on the plat form.\" 97 Thus it seems that Marx was completely outside the preparatory wo rk for the Communist Internationale which took place from 1862 to 1864. What's the point? The point is that Marx became a well-used and important front man for the secret societies which put the Internationale toget her. Nesta Webster said in World Revolution that, \"The Internationale every where found support in Freemasonry.\" 98 Thus, \"The Internationale, though itself an open a nd avowed association...became through its absorption of these existing secret organizations, a huge semi-secret society.\" 99 Webster added, \"The anti-religious policy adopted by the Internationale was the work of these secret influences.\" 100 In 1865, a great students' Congress took place in Liege.

Then everywhere, the citizens obliged to d efend themselves against the world minority or revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of civilization, and the multitude, disi llusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits will be from th at moment without compass, anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true light, through the universal manifestation to the pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally out i n the public view, a manifestation which will result from the general re actionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity a nd Atheism, both conquered and exterminated at the same time.\" 103 Pike at one time was the undisputed leader of Ameri can Freemasonry. He simultaneously occupied three different position s (1889): Grand Master of the Central Directory of Washington , D.C. (the head of D.C. Masonry) Grand Commander of the Supreme Council of Charlesto n (head of American Masonry) Sovereign Pontiff of Universal Freemasonry (head of World Masonry) The \"Sovereign Pontiff\" of Universal Freemasonry ad mitted that Masonry is an occult organization. He said that the sun, the moon and the Master of the Lodge are the three sublime lights of Masonry. He characterized the Sun as the ancient symbol of the life-giving and generative power of the Deity. The Moon, he said, s ymbolizes the female as the passive capacity of nature to produce. 104 Now you are beginning to understand why Pike would say that the writings of the apostles were simply \"articles of the vulgar faith.\" 105 Pike also revealed that this occult organization and its conspiracy against the Church and Monarchy likely preceded the Illuminati by centuries. In his book, Morals and Dogma, Pike says: \"It was impossible to unfold to the people th e conspiracy of the Templars against the Thrones and the Tiara. It was impossible to expose to 96"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Freemasonry and the Occult them the doctrines of the Chiefs of the Order.

Pike realized that most Masons have no idea what th ey have sworn an oath to. He acknowledged that Masons are terribly d eceived. Pike boasted: \"...Masonry jealously conceals its secrets and inte ntionally leads conceited interpreters astray.\" 107 Pike admitted that, \"The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of the s ymbols are displayed there to the Initiate, but he is intentionally misl ed by false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall u nderstand them. Their true explanation is reserved for the Adepts, the Pr inces of Masonry... \"It is well enough for the mass of those called Masons, to imagine that all is contained in the Blue Degrees; and whose attempts t o undeceive them will labor in vain....Masonry is the veritable Sphinx, b uried to the head in the sands heaped round it by the ages.\" 108 So, what is the truth about Freemasonry? Pike is on e of the few who will admit it. He stated clearly: \"That which we must say to the crowd is — We worshi p a God, but it is the God that one adores without superstition. \"To you, Sovereign Grand Inspectors General (33rd d egree masons), we say this, that you may repeat it to the brethren of the 32nd, 31st and 30th degrees — \"The Masonic religion should be, by all of us initiates of the high degrees, maintained in the purity of the L uciferian doctrine.\" 109 Pike confessed: \"Yes, Lucifer is God... \"Thus, the doctrine of Satanism is a heresy; and th e true and pure philosophic religion is the belief in Lucifer...\" 110 On page 321 of Morals and Dogma, Pike describes Luc ifer as \"the Light-bearer!\" He adds, \"Strange and mysterious nam e to give to the Spirit of Darkness! Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it he who bears the Light, and with its splendors intolerable blinds feeble, s ensual, or selfish Souls? Doubt it not!\" 111 Nothing in Freemasonry's philosophy has changed. As recently as January, 1989, Scottish Rite Sovereign Grand Comman der C.

Agreed, there is no external, formal, visible signa ture; it cannot be compared with signing one's name in blood, for bein g purely moral and immaterial, it demands that the man's soul be truly committed in the act.. .it is an agreement entered into seriously on both sides, and there is no escape from its clauses...the pupil himself is...in dissolubly bound to his masters... \".. .Note that the guides are never seen... \"At the basis of any real initiation there are cert ain duties contracted. Beware then of knocking at the gate of the Temple, if you are not resolved to become a new man... \"It would all be nothing more than a snare and a de lusion, if you could ask to be initiated free of all obligation, without paying with your very soul for your entry into brotherly communion...\" 115 In describing how the Mason must keep silent in the presence of non-Mason s, Wirth reveals that, \"The minor mysteries met with in the Convents (Lodg es) are in fact only symbols of much deeper secrets, which the Initiate will discover for himself as he follows the course of the Initiation. . .\" 116 \"From all this there emerges a Masonic faith expres sing itself in action and not tied to any one opinion. Masonry is the Chu rch of Human Progress...\" 117 98"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Freemasonry and the Occult \"Now the strength of Freemasonry lies in the collec tive will of its members.

Such is the hard fact which emerges and befor e which we bow our heads.\" 118 This is confirmed by the French Freemason Regis who in speaking at the Convent of the Grand Orient in 1918 said: \"Over and above all our other loyalties, a power we cannot deny governs us; that power is the spiritual power called Freemasonry.\" 119 Masonic author Wirth described this spiritual power as occultic with the words: \"T he beguiling serpent, who incites us to eat the fruit from the tree of kn owledge of good and evil, symbolises one particular instinct. He breaks away from the conservative instinct and represents both a nobler and a subtler impulse, whose purpose is to make man aware of his need to rise in the sca le of beings... \"That explains why the Serpent, inspiring disobedie nce, insubordination and revolt, was held accursed by th e ancient theocracies, while at the same time he was honoured among the in itiated, who considered that there could be nothing more sacred than those aspirations which lead us ever closer to the Gods, who are seen as rational (gnosis) powers, charged with bringing order out of chaos an d with governing the world\" 120 Hall assures us that \"Barbarism ends with the begin ning of world civilization.\" That apparently explains why the clo ser this Masonic anti- Christian Utopian \"world civilization\" comes, the m ore wars in Somalia, Yemen, Nigeria, Yugoslavia, Haiti, Rwanda, Burundi, Russia, and the more strife in every nation on the globe.

In this book, he said: \"All Masons above the third, or Master's degree, ar e sworn to keep inviolate the secrets of a brother, murder and trea son excepted, up to the seventh, or Royal Arch degree. In the oath of this degree the candidate, as we shall see, swears to keep all the secrets of a c ompanion of this degree, murder and treason not excepted. All Masons of and above this degree are solemnly bound to do this... 10 \"Here, then, we have a class of men sworn, under mo st frightful penalties, to espouse the cause of a companion so f ar as to extricate him from any difficulty, to the extent of their power, whether he is right or wrong. How can such a man be safely intrusted with any office connected with the administration of the law? He means to abi de by and perform this solemn oath, or he does not. If he does, will he no t inevitably defeat the due execution of law, if intrusted with office connecte d with it? Suppose he is a magistrate, a sheriff, marshall, or constable, wi ll he not be able to prevent the execution of justice, if he does all within his power, as he is solemnly sworn to do? If on a jury, if sworn as a witness, h ow can he be trusted, if he fulfills his Masonic vows? \"But suppose he does not intend to abide by and ful fill his vows, but still adheres, and does not renounce them; suppose he still recognizes their obligation, but fails to fulfill them, is he a man to be trusted with an office? If he does not respect and fulfill his Masonic oath s, the validity of which he acknowledges by continued adherence, of what ava il will be his oath of office? Of what use will it be for him to swear tha t he will faithfully execute the laws, if he has taken the oath of this degree, and either fulfills or fails to fulfill it? If he fulfills it, he surel y will not execute the law upon a companion Royal Arch Mason. If he still adheres t o, but fails to fulfill his oath, he does not respect the solemnity of an oath, and ought not to be intrusted with an office. If he publicly, sincerely , and penitently renounces his Masonic oath as unlawful, profane, and not bind ing, he may be trusted with office, but while he adheres he must violate e ither his oath of office, or his Masonic oath, whenever the accused is a Roya l Arch Mason, and, indeed, whenever such an one is involved in any leg al difficulty. \"I beseech the public not to think this severe. The re is, in fact, no third way. Take either horn of the dilemma and it amounts to the same thing.

I answer, he is a partaker of his guilt. He is truly an accessor y after the fact. This oath does not contemplate the professional services of a n advocate employed to defend an accused person in a court of justice. But even in this case an advocate has no right to defeat the due administrat ion of justice, and turn the criminal loose to prey upon society. When he do es this he sins both against God and society. It is his business to see that no injustice is done the accused; to secure for him a fair and impartial trial, but not to rescue him, if guilty. An advocate who would 'espouse the cause' of a criminal 'so far as to extricate him from his difficulty, wh ether right or wrong,' would deserve the execration of both God and man.\" 11 Finney also explained that the candidate in the Roy al Arch degree proceeds as follows, \"Also, that I will promote a c ompanion Royal Arch Mason's political preferment in preference to anoth er of equal qualifications. \" 12 With this in mind we understand now why Finney wro te: \"We see why such efforts are made to increase the number of Roy al Arch Masons, and the reasons held out to induce political aspirants to b ecome Royal Arch Masons. It is said, I suppose truly, that Royal Arch Masons are multiplying by scores of thousands in this country (1869). It is, beyond doubt, the design of their leaders to control the elections and secure the off ices throughout the country....If the public can not be aroused to look this conspiracy in the face, and rise up and put it down in time, they wil l surely find, too late, that their hands are tied, and that virtual slavery or a bloody revolution awaits us. Our children and grandchildren will reap the bitter fruits of our own folly and credulity.\" 13 He went on, \"What do Freemasons mean by this oath? They either intend to keep it, or not to keep it. If they mean to do as they have promised under the most solemn oath to do, then Freemasonry, at least Freemasonry of this and all the higher degrees, is a political conspiracy to secure the offices and the control of the government.\" 14 Once the government is secured in all its aspects and the people are unabl e to do anything about it or for that matter even know about it, Finney deter mined as any lawyer would that, \"The inevitable result, therefore, of s uch institutions is to give 109"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances one class of citizens unequal and unjust advantages over those who are not of the favored order.\" 15 \"It can not be a part of general benevolence but st ands unalterably opposed to the highest well-being of society in gen eral. The same, let me say, is true to a greater or less extent of all sec ret societies, whose members are bound by oath or pledge to treat each o ther with a favoritism that ignores the rights of others. Now, it has been said, and I think truly, that in the late war (civil war*) if a man wished p referment and high rank, he must be a high Mason. Such things were managed s o much by high Masons that it was difficult for a man to rise in r ank unless he could make himself known as a high Mason. And let the facts be come known — and, I hope that measures will be taken to make them kno wn — and I believe it will be found that the great mass of the lucrative offices in the United States are in the hands of the Freemasons. \"It is evident that thev are aiming to seize upon t he government, and to wield it in their own interest. They are fast do ing this, and unless the nation awake soon it will be too late.\" 16 \"In some places, where Freemasons are numerous and less on their guard, I am informed that they do not hesitate to s ay that they intend to have a Masonic government, peaceably if they can.\" 17 Finney concludes, \"Freemasonry is necessarily a wic ked institution, and incapable of thorough moral reformation.\" 18 Not only did Evangelist Finney attempt to alert the nation to the political ambitions of Freemasonry, but he also des perately attempted to awaken the Church. He exclaimed, \"And let the churc h of God also awake to the fact that many of her ministers and me mbers are uniting with a society so selfish and wicked as this, and a re defending it. and are ready to persecute all who will not unite with them in this thing.\" 19 Reverend Finney revealed that a particular Baptist denomination had been greatly carried away by Freemasonry: \"A large proportion of its eldership and membership were Freemasons.\" 20 He explained that the murder of William Morgan, a Freemason who exposed t he rites of Freemasonry, \"broke upon the churches — fast asleep on this subject — like a clap of thunder from a clear sky.

And should the qu estion be asked, 'What shall be done with the great number of professed Ch ristians who are Freemasons?' I answer, Let them have no more to do with it. Again, let Christian men labor with them, plead with them, and endeavor to make them see it to be their duty to abandon it. These o aths should be distinctly read to them, and they should be asked whether they acknowledge the obligation of these oaths, and whether they intend to do the things that they have sworn to do. Let it be distinctly pressed upon their consciences, that all Masons above the first two degrees have solemnly sw orn to conceal each other's crimes, murder and treason alone excepted, and all above the sixth degree have sworn to conceal each other's crimes, w ithout an exception. All above the sixth degree have sworn to espouse each o ther's cause and to deliver them from any difficulty, whether they are right or wrong.\" 22 Finney continued, \"Now, it is enough to make a man' s blood boil with indignation that such an institution as this should exist in the land. And what is most astonishing is. that members of the Ch ristian Church, and Christian ministers, should sympathize with, an d even unite themselves to. such an institution as this.\" 23 \"The fact is, that Freemasonry is the most anomalous, absurd, and abom inable institution that can exist in a Christian country; and is, on t he face of it, from the fact that it will not allow its principles to be discuss ed and divulged, a most dangerous thing in human society.\" 24 The evangelist claims, \"It is a false religion...It is a virtual conspiracy against both Church and State...I have not yet known the first Freemason who would affirm that an intelligent adherence to Freemasonry.. .is consistent with a pr ofession of the Christian religion...those who adhere intelligently and deter minately to such an institution have no right to be in the Christian Ch urch.\" 25 Then he asked the difficult question, \"Have we an i nstitution, the ramifications of which are entwining themselves wit h every fiber of our government and our institutions, our civil and reli gious liberties, of which 111"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances the whole country is so much afraid that they dare not speak the truth concerning it?\" 26 And in forthright Charles Finney style, he answere d: \"And now, are we in this country to hold our peace? to hold out our hands and have the shackles put upon them? Is the press t o be muzzled, and the whole country to be awed and kept under the feet of this institution, so that no man shall dare to speak his mind? God forbid! 'E very plant,' says Christ, 'which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up.'

Afr aid to speak out against such an abomination as this! Remember that he that would save his life by concealing the truth, and refusing to embrace and d efend it, shall lose it.\" 27 Finney exhorted the Church of Christ: \"Now, since t hese revelations are made, and both the church and the world are awa re of what Masonry really is, God demands, and the world has a right t o expect, that the church will take due action and bear a truthful testimony in respect to this institution. She can not now innocently hold her pe ace. The light has come. Fidelity to God, and to the souls of men, require t hat the church, which is the light of the world, should speak out, and shoul d take such action as will plainly reveal her views of the compatibility or in compatibility of Freemasonry with the Christian religion.\" 28 He pleaded with those of integrity within the Churc h to examine the subject of Freemasonry. He impelled them to action in order to save the flock: \"Every local branch of the Church of Christ is bound to examine this subject, and pronounce upon this institution, accor ding to the best light they can get. God does not allow individuals, or ch urches, to withhold action, and the expression of their opinion, until other churches are as enlightened as themselves. We are bound to act up t o our own light, and to go as far in advance of others as we have better me ans of information than they. We have no right to say to God that we will a ct according to our own convictions, when others become so enlightened that our action will be popular and meet their approval. \"Again: Those individuals and churches, who have ha d the best means of information, owe it to other branches of the chu rch, and to the whole world, to take action and to pronounce upon the unc hristian character of Freemasonry, as the most influential means within t heir reach of arousing the whole church and the world to an examination of the character and *Author's addition. 112"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"The Masonic Oaths claims of Freemasonry.\" 29 Others have spoken out against Freemasonry. Here ar e a few examples: As early as 1738, Pope Clement XII described Freema sonry as \"Satan's synagogue.\" 30 Pope Clement XII decreed: \"We have resolved and de creed to condemn and forbid such [secret] societies, asse mblies, reunions, conventions, aggregations or meetings, called eithe r Freemasonic or known under some other denomination. We condemn and forbi d them by this, our present constitution, which is to be considered val id forever. \"We commend to the faithful to abstain from interco urse with those societies...in order to avoid excommunication, whic h will be the penalty imposed upon all those contravening to this, our or der, none except at the point of death, could be absolved of this sin, exce pt by us or the then existing Roman Pontiff.\" 31 Over 200 years ago Pope Clement XIII (1758-1769) sa id: \"If We allow ourselves to be shaken by the audacity of evil-doer s, then the Episcopal strength is come to an end; the sublime and divine authority of the Church no longer exists; it is then useless to look upon ours elves as Christians if we have sunk so low as to tremble before the threats of the snares of the evil-doers.\" Pope Leo XIII exposed the secret society again in 1 884. He stated: \"Freemasons, like the Manichees of old, strive, as far as possible, to conceal themselves, and to admit no witnesses but t heir own members. As a convenient manner of concealment, they assume the character of literary men and scholars associated for purposes of learnin g.\" Their \"ultimate purpose,\" he said, is \"the utter overthrow of that whole religious and political order of the world which the Christian te aching has produced, and the substitution of a new state of things (New Worl d Order*) in accordance with their ideas of which the foundation s and laws shall be drawn from mere 'Naturalism.' \" He explained that M asons \"teach the great error of this age — that regard for religion should be held as an indifferent matter, and that all religions are alik e.\" He warned that liberalism and immorality would be p romoted in order for Masonry to succeed: \"For since generally no one is accustomed to obey crafty and clever men so submissively as those whose soul is weakened and broken down by the domination of the passions, there have been in the sect of the Freemasons some who have plainly determined and pro posed that artfully and of set purpose, the multitude should be satiated wi th a boundless license of vice, as, when this had been done, it (the people) would easily come under *Author's addition. 113"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances their [Masonry's] power and authority...\" Pope Leo expressed their drive to maintain control over the schools: \"With the greate st unanimity the sect of the Freemasons also endeavors to take to itself the edu cation of youth.\" \"Once the fear of God and reverence for divine laws are taken away, the authority of rulers becomes despised, sedition is p ermitted, and popular passions are urged to lawlessness,\" the Pontiff ass erted. \"With no restraint,\" he continued, \"a change and overthrow of all things will necessarily follow.\" Pope Leo cautioned that this change and overthrow o f all things \"is deliberately planned and put forward by many associ ations of Communists and Socialists; and to their undertaking s the sect of Freemasons is not hostile, but greatly favors their designs, and holds in common with them their chief opinions.\" He said to the Church: \"We wish it to be your rule first of all to tear away the mask from Freemasonry, and to let it be se en as it really is; and by sermons and Pastoral Letters to instruct the peo ple as to the artifices used by societies of this kind in seducing men and enticing them into their ranks, and as to the depravity of their opinions an d the wickedness of their acts. As Our predecessors have many times repeated, let no man think that he may for any reason whatsoever join the Masonic s ect, if he values his Catholic name and his eternal salvation as he ought to value them.\" In fighting this vicious enemy Pope Leo indicated o ur recourse: \"So vehement an attack demands an equal defense — namel y, that all good men should form the widest possible association of action and of praver.\" 32 According to Pope Leo, \"The only thing which has f ound grace before the members of the Masonic sect and in which they request that youth should receive the proper teaching is what th ey call 'civic morality', independent morality, free morality, in other words a morality in which religious beliefs find no room...\" (April 20, 1884) Our current \"X Generation\" is a typical result of Masonic planning . Pope Leo XIII even cautioned that the sect of Freem asonry had invaded the Church itself: \".. .Far too many of our compatriots, driven by hope of their personal advantage or by perverse amb ition, have given their names or support to the sect.\" He noted that Freemasonry \"regards the public power s as its instruments.\" Its successful persecution of the Chu rch \"though often executed by other hands...is inspired and promoted by Masonry...\" He warned that the media including the theater and fin e arts, as well as schools and universities, conspire \"to pervert mind s and corrupt hearts.\" In 1890 he foretold that the Masons in Italy planne d to abolish \"every kind 114"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"The Masonic Oaths of religious instruction\" in the schools...As in ou r own time he clearly identified the main source of the propaganda: \"The chief instrument employed by our enemies is the press...\" On December 8, 1892 Leo reiterated: \"Let us remembe r that Christianism and Freemasonry are essentially incomp atible, to such an extent, that to become united with one means being divorced from the other. Let us, therefore, expose Freemasonry as the enemy of God, of the Church and of our Motherland.\" The concept of \"the militant church\" is long forgotten. Nevertheless, Leo admonished us, \"I n the realm of spiritual salvation, there is no middle way: one either follo ws the road to perdition or else fights without limit to the very end.\" On September 8, 1907, Pope Pius X repeated his pred ecessors' concern over the Freemasons. This time the concern was over the pending destruction of the Church: \"Partisans of error (Freemasons) are to be sought not only among the Church's open enemies; they lie hid...in her very bosom and heart.\" Pope Pius X explained that he was referring specifically to Catholic laymen and those in \"the ranks of the priesthood it self.. ,\" 33 Pope Pius XI proclaimed, \"Masonry is our mortal ene my.\" As recently as May 23, 1958, Pope Pius XII stated: \"The roots of modem apostasy lay in scientific atheism, dialectical mat erialism, rationalism, illuminism, laicism, and Freemasonry - which is the mother of them all...\" In all, more than 200 documents issued by the Vatic an have condemned Masonry. 34 Others have so agreed: \"I do conscientiously and sincerely believe that th e Order of Freemasonry, if not the Greatest, is one of the Gre atest moral and political evils under which the Union is now labori ng. \"I am prepared to complete the demonstration before God and man, that the Masonic oath, obligations and penalti es cannot by any possibility be reconciled to the laws of morality, of Christianity, or of the land.\" John Quincy Adams - 1833 6th President of the United States \"The Masonic fraternity tramples upon our rights, d efeats the administration of justice, and bids of defiance to every government which it cannot control.\" Millard Fillmore - 13th President 115"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances \"The institution of Masonry ought to be abandoned a s one capable of much evil, and incapable of producing an y good which might not be effected by safe and open means.\" John Marshall, past Chief Justice of the Supreme Co urt past member of the Masonic Lodge \"...Masonry is a religious institution and as such is definitely anti-Christian...Membership in the Masonic fraterni ty is inconsistent with Christianity.\" Orthodox Presbyterian Church \"If the lodge went unchecked, the United States wou ld have a Masonic monarchy for its government, a Masonic chur ch, a Masonic way to a Masonic heaven, and blood and massacre and destruction to all who subscibe not to the support of the Monarch. \" William Preston Vaughn - former Mason and Minister (1830) The Bible says: \"Bear not the yoke with unbelievers.

The Order was f ounded in 1833 by General William Huntington Russell and Alph onso Taft. 1 Russell became a member of the Connecticut State L egislature in 1846. Alphonso Taft became Secretary of War for Pre sident Grant in 1876. Taft was the first of many members of The Order to hold this position even up to 1950! The Secretary of War is a critical posi tion for government because war is and has always been a way for the se lf-sustaining elite to control populations. It is a way to distract the pe ople. It is a cause to become excited about, a way to drive masses of peop le in the direction that you want them to go. Alphonso Taft was also U.S. Mi nister (Ambassador) to Austria in 1882-1884 and finally U.S. Ambassador to Russia in 1884- 1885. Alphonso Taft's father, William Howard Taft, was the only man to be both President and Chief Justice of the United S tates.

O ne example of a Yale editor and a member of The Order who made it big wa s Thomas Cochran who became an influential partner in the J.P. Morga n banking firm. 3 Of the first 15 members of The Order, the political influence can be seen immediately: Rufus Hart entered the Ohio Senat e, Asahel Hooker Lewis entered the Ohio Legislature, Samuel Marshall entered the Illinois State Legislature and Frederick Mather entered the New York Legislature. 4 Another influential name associated with The Order of Skull & Bones was Whitney. William Collins Whitney was init iated into The Order in 1863. He was Secretary of the Navy from 1885-188 9. 5 William Collins Whitney married Flora Payne who was the daughter of the Standard Oil Treasurer, Oliver Payne. Payne Whitney, one of two sons of William Collins Whitney was initiated into The Order of Sku ll & Bones in 1894. 6 The key Whitney son, however, was Harry Payne Whitn ey (initiated in 1898) who was involved with Guaranty Trust and the Guggenheim Exploration Company. 7 Harry Payne Whitney married Gertrude Vanderbilt in 1896 and so the wealthy became wealthier. The prodigy of Harry Payn e Whitney and Gertrude Vanderbilt was Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitne y, who married Marie Norton. Cornelius and Marie divorced but not without Marie gaining a tidy bit of the now Whitney-Payne-Vanderbilt fort une. Divorcee Marie Norton then proceeded to tie her fortune to similar wealth, that of W. Averell Harriman. W. Averell Harriman had acquired his money as a railroad magnate. Both his sons, Edward Roland Noel Harriman and William Averell Harriman attended Yale and became i nitiates of The Order of Skull & Bones. 8 W.A. Harriman's father, Edward H. Harriman married Mary Averell, the daughter of a New York banker and railroad pres ident. At 22, he bought a seat on the New York Stock Exchange. Even though E. H. Harriman gave $250,000 to Theodore Roosevelt's Republican Nationa l Committee, two years after the gift, Roosevelt wrote Senator Sherm an and described Harriman as a man of \"deep seated corruption,\" an \" undesirable citizen\" and \"an enemy of the Republic.\" 9 The Dictionary of American Biography states that Harriman was guilty of a combination in restraint of trade that led to an investigation by the Interstate Commerce Commission. His 119"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances dubious financial activities netted him $60 million . The deal was transacted through Kuhn Loeb & Co., his backers and bankers. 10 It was Jacob Schiff of Kuhn Loeb who gave $20,000,000 to s upport the Communist revolution in Russia. The New York Journa l-American, February 3, 1949 stated: \"Today it is estimated eve n by Jacob's grandson, John Schiff, a prominent member of New York Society , that the old man sank $20,000,000 for the final triumph of Bolshevis m in Russia. Other New York banking firms also contributed.\" 11 Another member of the Order of Skull & Bones who wa s active in aiding the Communist Bolsheviks was Amos Pinchot. P inchot's greater claim to fame, however, was that as a member of Sku ll & Bones he was a founder of the American Civil Liberties Union — the ACLU! 12 W.A. Harriman graduated from Yale in 1913. He start ed with his father's company, Union Pacific Railroad.

S cotland Yard's Intelligence Report claimed: \"Martens is very much in the limelight. There appea rs to be no doubt about his connection with the Guarantee (sic) Trust Company. Although it is surprising that so large and influential an ente rprise should have dealings with a Bolshevik concern.\" 16 (Note that in 1917, W. Averell Harriman was a director of Guaranty Trust. 17 ) Guaranty Trust Company was founded in New York in 1 864. In 1910, it merged with Morton Trust Company, in 1912 it mer ged with Standard Trust Company, and in 1929 it merged with the Natio nal Bank of Commerce. In 1912, Mrs. Edward Harriman sold her bl ock of 8,000 shares of the total outstanding 20,000 shares to J.P. Morg an, a front man for the Rothschilds. Since that time the J.P. Morgan firm h as effectively controlled Guaranty Trust and since 1954 the merged firms have been known as Morgan-Guaranty Company. 18 Where did the original capital for Guaranty Trust c ome from? It came from the Whitney, Rockefeller, Harriman and Vanderb ilt families, all represented significantly in The Order of Skull & B ones. 19 The Rockefeller investment in Guaranty Trust was repres ented by Percy Rockefeller who was born in 1878 the son of William D. Rockefeller (brother of John D. Rockefeller) and had inherited part of the Standard Oil fortune. Percy became a member of The Order in 1900 and was a director of Guaranty Trust in the 1915-1930 period. 20 Harry Payne Whitney (The Order, 1894) inherited two Standard Oil fortunes, o ne each from the Payne 121"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances and Whitney families. Harry Payne Whitney was a dir ector of Guaranty Trust, as was his father, William C. Whitney (The O rder, 1863). 21 Guaranty Trust made a joint banking agreement with the Soviets and installed a Guaranty Trust Vice President, Max May, as director in charge of the foreign division of this Soviet bank, the Ru skombank. Sutton explains the reality of the deception: \"In brief, while the U.S. public was being assured by the U.S. Government that the Soviets were dastardly murderer s, while 'Reds' were being deported back to Russia by the Department of Justice, while every politician (almost without exception) was assuring the American public that the United States would have no relations with the Soviets — while this barrage of lies was aimed at a gullible public , behind the scenes the Guaranty Trust Company was actually running a divis ion of a Soviet bank! Meanwhile American troops were being cheered by Soviet revolutionaries for helping protect the Revolution. \" 22 By 1930, W.A. Harriman & Co. had merged with a fina ncial giant called Brown Brothers, a private international bank ing firm founded in 1800. Now referred to as Brown Brothers Harriman, w ith assets of over a half billion dollars, the firm carefully brought in no less than nine individual partners who were members of The Order. 23 Now the plot thickens. Who do you suppose some of these partners were? Two of the less known partners of Brown Brothers, H arriman are Skull & Bones men — W. A. Harriman and Knight Woolley, bu t the most notable is Prescott Bush, the father of George Bush . Prescott Bush was initiated into the Order of Skull & Bones in 1917 a nd was a partner in Brown Brothers, Harriman for over 40 years! 24 George Bush became a member of Skull & Bones in 1949. George Bush's olde st son, George W. Bush was also initiated into the secret order of Sk ull & Bones in 1968. 25 Averell Harriman was a staunch Democrat. Bush was a staunch Republican. Do you still believe there is a differe nce between the parties? These same people financed RCA and CBS as well. Do you still believe you are getting any truth in the news? Do you still think George Bush is a simple conservative Republican? Antony Sutton informs us that from World War I, wel l into the 1930s, The Order's \"front man\" in both Guaranty Trust and Brown Brothers, Harriman was Matthew C. Brush. As a matter of fact, Brush was also the Chairman of the Georgian Manganese Company when its site was in Russia. Remember that Harriman formed this company in 1923. On July 12, 1925, a concession agreement was made between t he W.A. Harriman 122"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"The Order — The Illuminati Pedigree Company of New York and the Communist U.S.S.R. for exploitation of the Chiaturi manganese deposits and extensive introduct ion of modern mining and transportation methods. 26 Now who was Matthew Brush? Brush was not from Yale nor was he a member of The Order of Skull & Bones. Rather, Brush was a Knight Templar, a 32nd degree Mason and a Shriner! 27 The question naturally arises, does The Order use Freemasonry to do its bi dding? In 1932 Knight Woolley, a member of The Order of Sk ull & Bones, was a director of Guaranty Trust and a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Woolley was also a director of th e Union Banking Corporation of New York City. The Harrimans had a f inancial stake in Union Banking and E. Roland Harriman, W. Averell Ha rriman's brother, was a director of this Union Banking Corporation. A nother bank called the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart N.V. — controlled t he Union Banking Corporation in New York. In other words, this Dutch bank was affiliated with the W. A. Harriman financial interests in New York. The details of this joint operation show that this bank, Union Banking Corporation of which E. Roland Harriman was director, helped finance Hit ler! Most revealing of all, however, is the fact that Prescott Sheldon Bush, the father of George Bush, was a partner of Brown Brothers, Harriman and a director of Union Banking with Harriman and Woolley in 1932 ! 28 In his book The Secret Establishment, Antony Sutton says that this secret society of German origin has links with Brit ain through Lazard Freres and the private merchant bankers. It is inte resting to note that Lazard Freres is one of the dictators of the privat e Federal Reserve Bank which has the American Congress in its back pocket. 29 The first chairman of the Federal Reserve was Pierre Jay, another memb er of the prestigious Skull & Bones. The point person for the FED was Sen ator Carter Glass of Virginia, a 33rd degree Freemason of the Scottish R ite. It all begins to fit together when we add in the developers and owners o f the private Federal Reserve Bank — the Rothschild, Guggenheim, Schiff, Warburg and Rockefeller families. Sutton states: \"There is an I lluminati connection'\" 30 American history begins to look a little different than they teach it in school when you take into account the influence of The Order of Skull & Bones. A prominent member of Skull & Bones was Henr y Stimson (initiated 1888). By 1890, Stimson was fresh out of Yale, The Order and Harvard Law School. William C. Whitney had been the Secretary of the Navy and had as his attorney, Elihu Root.

When President Taft (The Order) need ed a Secretary of War in 1911 he appointed Stimson. In 1927, under Pr esident Coolidge, Stimson was appointed Governor-General of the Phili ppines. Under President Hoover in 1929, Stimson became Secretary of State. In 1940 Stimson was appointed as President Roosevelt's Secr etary of War. And in 1945, under 33rd degree Mason President Truman, Sti mson recommended the atomic bomb drops on Hiroshima and Nagasacki — the two most predominantly Catholic cities in Japan. 31 During World War II Stimson had as a Skull & Bones sidekick a special assistant - Harvey Hollister Bundy - initia ted into Skull & Bones in 1909. 32 During his tenure as Secretary of State, Stimson b rought in Harvey's son - McGeorge Bundy - who was initiated i nto The Order in 1940. McGeorge Bundy was Special Assistant for Nati onal Security Affairs to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. He was N ational Security Advisor in the early years of the Vietnam war. At t he very same time, his brother, William P. Bundy (initiated into Skull & B ones in 1939) was Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pac ific Affairs. Prior to his position in the Far East, William Bundy had been in the CIA for a decade. With men like this in these positions, you can clea rly understand why we lost the Vietnam war. In 1972 William Bundy became editor of Foreign Affairs, the prestigious journal of the Council on Foreign Relations. 33 William Bundy married Mary Acheson daughter of Dean Acheson. Dean Acheson was a member of another very secret Ya le society — Scroll & Key, an offshoot of The Order. His son David Ache son is a member of The Order of Skull & Bones. 34 Cyrus Vance is also a member of the secret society of Scroll & Key. 35 By 1966, McGeorge Bundy was appointed President of the Ford Foundation and remained there until 1979. 36 Bundy was carefully selected for the job since we now know that it was Rowan Gai ther of the Ford Foundation who explained to Senator Christopher Dod d that it was the objective of the Ford Foundation under direct order s from the White House to \"comfortably merge\" the United States with the S oviet Union. Other privileged notables associated with The Order of Skull & Bones include the Lord family.

Together with his fat her, Daniel Lord, the law firm of Lord, Day and Lord was establ ished. Today, one of Lord's clients is the Samuel Rubin Foundation.

The Rub in Foundation is one of the Communist financiers for the radical Ins titute for Policy Studies which has infiltrated itself thoroughly int o the American government. The history of the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS ) goes like this: In 1960, James Jeremiah Wadsworth, a member of The Order of Skull & Bones (initiated 1927), and Arthur Waskow s et up the Peace Research Institute. 42 In 1963 this organization was incorporated by Marc us Raskin, a staff member of the National Security Cou ncil and an aide to Skull & Bones' McGeorge Bundy (initated 1940). 43 Co-Contributors were: Arthur Waskow, David Riesman, Michael Maccoby and C ouncil on Foreign Relations member James Warburg. Grants came from the Samuel Rubin Foundation and the Stern Family Fund. Samuel Rubin was himself a member of the elite Comintern of the Communist Pa rty, founded by none other than Lenin himself. 44 Billionaire Armand Hammer assisted Rubin in making the fortunes which helped launch IPS. 45 Philip Stern, an IPS trustee, was the president of the Stern Fund.

Wright Mil ls has called the Power Elite — a group of men, similar in interest a nd outlook, shaping events from invulnerable positions behind the scene s...It has been called 'the government in exile.' \" 65 Let us take a look at more of the legacy of The Ord er of Skull & Bones: The Order was foremost in the development of the Un ited Nations. But it was a long and arduous road. The little know n American Society for the Judicial Settlement of International Disputes w as founded in 1920 by Theodore Marburg. Marburg was its first President. Its first chairman was William Howard Taft, member of The Order of Skull & Bones. The American Society for the Judicial Settlement of Int ernational Disputes was the forerunner of the League to Enforce the Peace. The League to Enforce the Peace developed into the League of Nations and the League of Nations evolved into the United Nations. 66 The League of Nations was promoted heavily by International Freemasonry. We know that the result of World War I was the Leag ue of Nations. In other words, World War I was fought in order to est ablish the League of Nations, which the United States at that time had t oo much sense to join. Following the plan for world government, World War II culminated in the United Nations. Who do you suppose was behind the U NESCO organization of the United Nations? You guessed it — a member of The Order of Skull & Bones — Archibald McLeash. The Jul y 19, 1952 issue of Saturday Review candidly reported what the purpo se of UNESCO is: \"If UNESCO is attacked on the grounds that it is he lping to prepare the world's peoples for world government, then it is an error to burst forth with apologetic statements and denials. Let us face it: the job of UNESCO is to help create and promote the elements of world ci tizenship. When faced with such a 'charge,' let us all by all means affirm it from the housetops.\" 67 To maintain control over journalism by letting jour nalists know what is appreciated by the elite, The Order established the Nieman Fund which offers a prestigious award in journalism. The first Director of the Nieman 131"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances Fund? — Archibald McLeash. The Order knows the importance of controlling the c ommunications industry — that way no one exposes their charades. Prominent members of Skull & Bones in the media include the famous Henry Luce of Time-Life. Luce was also a member of the powerful Council on F oreign Relations. Time-Life controls and publishes People, Life, Fort une, Money and Sports Illustrated. In the foreward to the book, Beyond Su rvival published in 1959, Luce stated that the objective was \"to spur t he government and people of the United States to arrive at some convi ctions — intellectual convictions about what they are doing in the world. ..Recently I have found.. .their [the American people] most commonly shared opinion is that the United States lacks a clear sense of purpose in its world activities.\" 68 Thereafter Life enlisted eight distinguished Americ ans to respond to what Luce called \"a summons, of some urgency\" on the nat ional purpose. They were: 1. Adlai Stevenson - a Council on Foreign Relations me mber who presided at the United Nations; he ran for presiden t as a Democrat against Republican Eisenhower when both were member s of the CFR. 69 2. Archibald MacLeish - member of The Order of Skull & Bones. He was head of UNESCO which promotes world government. 3. David Sarnoff - member of the Council on Foreign Re lations. He was appointed chairman of the board of RCA in 1929. 70 Sarnoff had acted as an assistant to Owen Young, a front man fo r J.R Morgan at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. 71 Sarnoff was a former British Intelligence agent. 72 The RCA building in New York was the headquarters of MI6 chief British Intelligence offi cer, Sir William Stephenson. 73 RCA's directorate is composed of British-American establishment figures who figure prominently in org anizations such as the CFR, NATO, the Club of Rome, the Trilateral Commission, Freemasonry, Skull & Bones, Bilderbergers and the R ound Table. 74 4. Walter Lippman - member of the Council on Foreign R elations. He was an author and a syndicated columnist. 75 Lippman was part of a committee appointed by Woodrow Wilson to draw up a charter for world government. While a student at Harvard, Lippm an joined the British Fabian Society in 1909. He became president of the Harvard chapter of the Intercollegiate Socialist Society an d was a close friend of Felix Frankfurter, also a Socialist.

This new recruit, Walter Lip pman, has been from 1914 to the present, the authentic spokesman i n American journalism for the Establishments on both sides of the Atlantic in international affairs. His biweekly columns, which appeared in hundreds of American papers, were copyrighted by th e New York Herald Tribune, later owned by J.H. Whitney. (Recal l it was the New York Tribune who hired Karl Marx as a foreign c orrespondent during the civil war.) It was these connections as a link between Wall Street and the Round Table Group, which gave L ippman the opportunity in 1918, while still in his twenties, t o be the official interpreter of the meaning of Woodrow Wilson's Four teen Points to the British Government.\" 80 5. Clinton Rossiter - Rossiter was a professor of p olitical science at the heavily Communist-infiltrated Cornell University. H e was a member of the faculty since 1946. In 1953, he began to serve as a consultant to the Ford Foundation's Fund for the Re public. In January, 1955, Rossiter was appointed to head an el even-man team of scholars to study the effects of bringing Commun ism into various aspects of American life. \"We're thoroughly aware o f the controversial nature of the subject,\" Rossiter said after his appointment. Then he set out to educate himself \"in the whole range of Marxist studies.\" The preliminary project was a 474-page Bibliography on the Communist Program in the United States, compiled by Rossiter as part of a three-man committ ee and published by the Fund for the Republic in 1955. Cri tics charged that 133"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances the bibliography had a pro-Communist slant and ommi tted important anti-Communist works.

Where would he get the funding for bringing Communi sm to America? Rossiter had been a consultant to the Rock efeller Foundation. From 1956 to 1958 he served on the Rock efeller committee on legal and political philosophy. In 196 0 he was a contributor to Goals for Americans, the President's report on National Goals. In his book, Constitutional Dictato rship; Crisis Government in the Modern Democracies, Rossiter used the thesis that in times of crisis, democracies tend to turn t o dictatorship. In 1956 he wrote The American Presidency in which he c oncluded that the growing power of the President is no cause for concern. (Many Americans would likely disagree with that view toda y.) In his Parties and Politics in America, Rossiter maintaine d that \"the Republican and Democratic parties...have tended to unite the American people.\" 82 Only now do we realize that there is no difference between the parties! During the height o f the Cold War and the Viet Nam war, Rossiter lectured to the Acad emy of Sciences of the Soviet Union - Spring, 1966. In the New York Times (June 13, 1960) Rossiter argued for world peace and co-operat ion through the United Nations and called on Americans to rise abov e self-interest to aid the \"whole human race.\" He caused an absolut e flurry at a meeting of the Daughters of the American Revolution when he maintained in a speech that it was the mission of t he United States \"to lead the world over the centuries to a system o f world government.\" 83 6. John W. Gardner - member of the Council on Forei gn Relations. Gardner is listed under Officers and Trustees of th e Carnegie Corporation of New York as well as Carnegie Foundat ion for the Advancement of Teaching. In 1991, David Hornbeck of the Carnegie Foundation co-edited Human Capital and Ame rica's Future in which this Carnegie employee proposed tha t the government's duty \"would begin during a mother's pr egnancy.\" In typical gangland Communist style the Carnegie emplo yee proposed 134"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The Order — The Illuminati Pedigree legislation calling for a \"State Board for Children and Families (BCF)\" which would have \"a new affirmative duty for government to assure the health and non-academic well-being of each child.. .Court orders and/or legislation must be ou r primary vehicles to provoke and sustain the magnitude and kind of ch ange that is necessary.. .Success must not be left to chance.. . All of this must be done legislatively.\" 84 The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child is the logical outcome of this kind of demented reasoning. 7. Albert Wohlstetter - Council on Foreign Relations m ember 8. Billy Graham - In 1957 Billy Graham received $75,00 0 from John D. Rockefeller, Jr. for his New York Crusade. 85 In Graham's 1963 Los Angeles Crusade, Methodist Bishop Gerald Kenned y was chairman of the crusade committee. In 1966, Graham recommended Kennedy for a crusade in Shreveport. Dr. Bob Jones Jr. issued a statement which read, \"...Bishop Kennedy denies the virgin birth and the infallibility and authority of the Word of God. He is known religiously as a leftwing, liberal preacher.\" 86 Dr. Jones, of course, understood that Methodist Bishop Gerald Kennedy was a member of a variety of Communist Front organizations. Kenn edy, for obvious reasons, was also a longtime foe of any Con gressional investigation of Communist subversion in the United States. In 1966, Graham was honorary chairman of the first World Congress on Evangelism. Graham and his colleagues i nvited \"religious leaders\" from Communist countries to att end the meetings in Berlin and the Communists obliged. Reve rend Richard Wurmbrand was also invited. He was a veteran of fou rteen years in a Communist prison in Romania for the crime of bein g a Christian minister. When Reverend Wurmbrand learned that \"rel igious leaders\" from Communist countries would be at the C ongress, he wrote a letter to Billy Graham in which he said: \"I come from behind the Iron Curtain and it is unimaginable that from these countries anybody should be able to attend such a C ongress if he is not an informer of the Secret Police. You know that Cardinal Wyzinsky in Poland is treated as an international b urglar and is not allowed to leave his country. How can you imagine t hat Communists will allow evangelists to attend a World Congress? Their evangelists are in prison, I have given you t heir names and I can give you hundreds of other names. Now, if they keep their 135"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances evangelists in prison, who will be the ones who wil l come as evangelists to our Congress?\" 87 What do you think was the response of Graham and th e World Congress to Wurmbrand's invitation? The World Congr ess responded by withdrawing his invitation and telling him in writing that \"no delegate is allowed to speak against Commu nism.\" 88 According to the Chicago Tribune, April 7, 1970, \"G raham said that he also refused to discuss communism... 'For years I have not spoken about that,' he said, 'I cannot go around th e world and say who is right and who is not right.' \" 89 J. Edgar Hoover once warned. \"If a minister can be influenced to keep silent abo ut the dangers of communism, the Party has gained.\" 90 Actually this position is not at all inconsistent w ith Graham's customary view. Since 1960, Billy Graham has been a regular participant in meetings of the World Council of Chu rches. In 1966 the Ecumenical Press Service carried an interview w ith Graham in which the evangelist is quoted as follows: \"The Wor ld Congress on Evangelism does not want to be understood as being in opposition to the World Council of Churches.. .many of those a t the Congress belong to member churches of the World Council, som e holding prominent positions in the World Council.\" 91 By 1969, Billy Graham was actually writing for the Marxist World C ouncil of Churches. In one of his speeches before the Nationa l Council of Churches, he said, \"My wife is a Presbyterian. Her denomination is in the National Council so perhaps I am here by mar riage.\" 92 It is one thing to keep silent. It is something els e again to support Communism. In the May 28, 1973, Mainichi Da ily News, published in Tokyo, Graham declared, \"I think commu nism's appeal to youth is its structure and promise of a future U topia. Mao Tse- tung's eight precepts are basically the same as the Ten Commandments. In fact, if we can't have the Ten Com mandments read in our schools, I'll settle for Mao's precepts .\" 93 In Graham's 1969 Congress on Evangelism, one of the featured speakers was the \"Reverend\" Ralph Abernathy. Aberna thy is an avowed Marxist revolutionary who has declared that Communist East Germany \"embodies what we aspire to in the wor ld.\" One report of the event stated that Abernathy's \"presen ce was a surprise and shock to many of the delegates because of his w ell known radical stand.\" Graham, however, did not object. No r did he offer 136"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"The Order — The Illuminati Pedigree any apology to the 5,000 delegates after Abemathy u nleased a predictably vicious tirade against the Christian ch urches and the United States. 94 After a visit to Communist Hungary, and after he ha d called at the headquarters of that country's Soviet-controlle d Ecumenical Council of Churches, Billy returned to New York for a press conference. On September 15, 1977, Graham told repo rters that he had found \"a total separation of church and state i n Hungary\" during his recent visit to that East European country. Mr. Graham commented that \"during the 50s, as most of you know , I took a very strong stand on communism. But as I've grown older, I've quit preaching on political matters because I think the church can exist in any kind of society.\" Asked whether he could sup port a Communist government, Billy indicated that what he meant was that Christians could adjust to Communism \"just as the Jewish people adjusted to Rome\" during the period of the R oman empire. (Nevermind that the Jews were slaughtered by the Ro mans in 70 A.D.) The very day after Graham's world-wide public ized press conference, Father Julian Fuzer, president of the A merican- Hungarian Catholic Priests' Association, declared t hat \"the 1,000- year-old Catholic Church has been destroyed many ti mes during the centuries, but it has never been so cruelly devasta ted and so severely tried as it is now. Suffering has always been the g lory of the Church, and there is plenty of suffering in the Church of H ungary today, as well as among all other God-fearing Hungarians — Ca tholics, Protestants, Jews, all are suffering alike.\" The Ca tholic priest pointed out the \"bleeding wounds\" of the Church, th at is, \"the suppression of religious orders, the abolition of C atholic schools, the confiscation of Catholic institutions, hospital s, monasteries, etc., the nominal existence of the Catholic press, the co ntinuous surveillance of the Catholic bishops, and state-sup ported atheism and materialism to which all Catholic children must be exposed.\" 95 Yet I suppose the \"Christians can adjust,\" right Bi lly? It doesn't end there. Peacemaker Graham was next se en on the front cover of the August 1979 Sojourners magazine, a journal for radically politicized clergy and activist laity. 96 The caption read: \"Billy Graham: Preaching Against the Arms Race.\" In making several points, Graham said, \"I have, I suppose, co nfused the kingdom of God with the American way of life,\" and \"I especially 137"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances was impressed with the concerns various Christians in these [Eastern European] countries expressed about peace. I believe...they have something to teach us here.\" 97 Marxist Richard Barnet of the Institute for Policy Studies then wro te in reply: \"The Soviet threat is the big lie of the arms race. ..a national myth used as the rationale for...a policy of U.S. m ilitary intervention over two generations. \"The characteristic of sin is confusion. We become possessed by irrational fears. Our minds stop working. The Ru ssians stop being people and become symbols. \"To be obsessed by the Soviet threat...is, quite li terally, to be blinded by hate (and common sense*). \"Billy Graham's courageous confession...ought to fo rce all of us to realize how often we fall into the same trap. \" 98 Years later, Graham was invited to Moscow, where he proclaimed that he saw no evidence of religious per secution; probably because all of the Christians were either in prison or in Siberia. In 1990, Billy Graham got his own star on Hollywood 's Walk of Fame. 99 More recently Graham has attacked critics of Bill Clinton and called for newspapers to ease up on Clinton and instead support him. At a luncheon for 500 newpaper editors at thei r annual convention in Washington, D.C., Graham said that th e President's personal life and character are \"irrelevant.\" 100 At the luncheon, Billy refused comment on Clinton's advocacy of homo sexuality or the President's promotion of sexual promiscuity, di sease and abortion. He forgot to mention the Gay & Lesbian in augural ball that was thrown in Washington, D.C. in Clinton's ho nor. 101 Nor did he refer to Clinton's string of adulterous affairs or his financial felonies. Rather, he promoted Clinton as a man of G od. He explained that he and Clinton had been close friend s for many years and stated, \"I believe Bill has gone to his knees m any times and asked God to help him.\" 102 In 1993 Graham again supported Clinton. On January 20, 1993, on the \"Larry King Live\" show Graham commended Clin ton, but stayed clear of questions about Clinton's pro-homos exual and pro- abortion views, even though Larry King asked him th ree times *Author's addition. 138"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The Order — The Illuminati Pedigree about them. Three times Graham refused to comment. Graham did say, however, that he had never in the past — nor w ould he ever in the future — bring up to the President the issues o f homosexuality and abortion. \"If I did that,\" Graham explained, \"I would not be invited back to the White House.\" Later, in an inte rview with U.S. News and World Report (May 3, 1993), the evangelist tried to send the President to the seminary saying, \"I am quite i mpressed with his charisma and with some of the things he believes. I f he (President Clinton) chose to preach the gospel instead of poli tics, he would make a great evangelist.\" 103 How could this be? This is impossible you say? I ex plained earlier that later on I would tell you who the inte rnationally known evangelist was who appeared at the House of the Tem ple in Washington, D.C. to celebrate Jim Shaw's swearing a llegiance to the Supreme Council of the 33rd degree, the oath of allegiance that all 33rd degree Masons take - above and beyond any oath to God or to country. That internationally prominent evangeli st was none other than Reverend Billy Graham! Sadly, most of us are too busy to study a man outside of what the TV represents to us. This has proved lethal to America. Now perhaps we can finally understand why the likes of William Randolph Hearst would say \"Puff Graham.\" An d perhaps now we can understand why Henry Luce would have Eva ngelist Billy Graham sit in on a \"summons, of some urgency\" to debate the \"national purpose\" with a host of members of the pr o-Marxist Council on Foreign Relations. And perhaps now we ca n understand that Graham was simply filling the Rockefeller mand ate to have another crusade \"to bring the warring factions of C hristianity together.\" Apparently, Billy Graham has a special tie-in with the liberal media as well since they covered up a report that h is nephew, Kevin Graham Ford, pleaded guilty for exposing himself to two teenaged girls. There was also a story about a $23 million s lush fund scandal which briefly threatened the Graham empire, but tha t also suddenly disappeared from mention in the national media. 104 More recently Cal Thomas interviewed Graham and ask ed: \"You've been reluctant to speak out on the top soci al issue of our time, abortion. Why?\" Graham's response: \"I think t he top social issue of our time may be ecology (the environment). I think that's 139"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances more dangerous.. .and I'm gong to start speaking ou t on that.\" This discourse followed a previous meeting Graham had ov er candlelight dinner with Vice President Al Gore, wherein a third of the time was spent talking about the environment. Although some may find it strange that Graham would support the pantheist Gor e, as long ago as January 1978, Billy Graham told an interviewer: \" I used to believe that pagans in faroff countries were lost — were going to hell,\" said Graham. \"I no longer believe that. I be lieve that there are other ways of recognizing the existence of God — th rough nature, for instance.\" 105 For those who are still in the dark as to how such strange language could possible be used by Graham l et me point out that this is perfectly typical language for an illu minated member of the Masonic Lodge. The idea that the media is supposed to report the n ews is a misconception. When you are a member of The Order o f Skull & Bones like Henry Luce, 106 you manipulate and control the news and lead the masses the way you want them to go. As far back as 1943, Henry Luce had suggested to hi s editors that the main function of any future world organization (Do you suppose he knew that the United Nations would be formed just years later?) should be \"to search out, to extemporize, to test, to articulate the common law of mankind.\" 107 He approved of a \"world order\" which could be foun d in the concept of \"natural law.\" That is, man-made law out side of the laws of God. In 1956 when Luce spoke before the Connecticut Bar Association, he stated that: \"If rulers feel they must appear lawfu l then to an extent they must be lawful.. .the challenge to be lawful is the most effective challenge at the bar of world opinion.\" Then he emphasized th e need for repeal of the Connally Amendment which limited participation in the World Court. He pursued the destruction of American sovereignty with the words: \"World law can grow only ...through the accretion o f precedent and example. To the extent that we set the example we s hall have added to the precedents which help extend world order under the rule of law.\" 108 This speech was reprinted in Fortune and the Journa l of the American Bar Association. It helped found the World Peace Th rough Law movement which led to the World Peace Through Law conference in Washington in September 1965. It was here that Luce prophesied th at world government (the New World Order) might become fact — \"by, say, the year 2000... 140"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"The Order — The Illuminati Pedigree The world we are determined to have is a world char acterized by the rule of law...which binds the pride of nations to t he common good and which protects the individual from the arrogance of governments...\" 109 (That is — the arrogance of a sovereign nation with a sovereign constitution like that of the United States of Amer ica!) It was this \"rule of law\" ideal that fashioned another famous secret soc iety person's thinking, that of Lionel Curtis of England's Round Table grou p, which set the course for the Council on Foreign Relations. He said : \"The rule of law as contrasted with the rule of an individual is the distinguishing mark of the Commonwealth... \"The task of preparing for freedom the races which cannot as yet govern for themselves is the supreme duty of those who can.. .\" 110 One wonders if the impoverished third world nations enjoy the so- called \"freedom\" of Marxist-Communism which the eli te have bestowed upon them from their exalted \"supreme\" positions. A s the elite take upon themselves godlike qualities, they swell with pride . Their egos finally expand so much that the pressure on their ears prev ents them from hearing anyone tell them, \"Excuse me, but you are not God.\" Russell Wheeler Davenport of Fortune Magazine was a lso a member of The Order of Skull & Bones (Initiated 1923). 111 Control over the media was made more complete through Alfred Cowles, the president of Cowles Communications which published Look, the Des Moines Register, and the Minneapolis Star. Cowles was initiated into The Order in 1913. 112 He was also an active Mason. Understanding the nece ssity to promote the idea that The Order has a conservative side as well as its Marxist side, William Buckley Jr. \"spins\" his vocabulary for us i n National Review. Buckley is another member of The Order of Skull & B ones. He was initiated in 1950, the year after George Bush. 113 Education The first president of Cornell University was Andre w Dickson White, a member of The Order of Skull & Bones. The first p resident of the University of California was Daniel Coit Gilman, al so a member of The Order. Gilman became the first president of Johns H opkins University. 114 Daniel Coit Gilman also became the first president of the Carnegie Institution which controls education in America tod ay.

This did not h appen by accident. John Dewey, considered the Father of the American E ducation System, was trained at Johns Hopkins University from 1882-8 6 under the Hegelian philosopher, George Sylvester Morris. Morris receiv ed his doctorate from the University of Berlin. Daniel Coit Gilman of Sku ll & Bones hired Morris knowing full well that Morris was Hegelian i n philosophy, meaning that education was not meant to be child-centered, but rather State- centered. 115 For Hegel, the child has no value as an individual except as he or she performs a function for society. For Hegel, every quality of an individual exists only at the mercy and will of the State. The University of Chicago was founded in 1890 with Rockefeller money. In 1894, Dewey went to the University of Chi cago and in 1902 was appointed Director of its School of Education. 116 Dewey believed that children do not go to school to develop individual talents but rather are to be prepared as \"units\" in an organic society. The N ational Education Association produced a program for the 1976 Bicente nnial entitled, \"A Declaration Of Interdependence: Education For A Glo bal Community.\" In this document we read the flowering of the Hegel-De wey educational plan for the world: \"We are committed to the idea of Education for Glob al Community. You are invited to help turn the commitment into ac tion and mobilizing world education for development of a world communit y.\" 117 Promoting the beliefs of Hegel and Dewey, an associate Professor of Educational Management and Development at New Mexico State Univ ersity states,\"When community educators say that community education takes into consideration the total individual and his tot al environment, they mean precisely this: ...It seeks to integrate the indivi dual within himself and within his community until the individual becomes a cosmic soul and the community the world.\" 118 He adds, \"The Cosmic soul...the whole human race is going to evolve an effective soul of its ow n — the cosmic soul of the race. That is the future of human evolution. As a result of the emergence of the universal soul, there will be a gr eat unification of the entire human race, ushering into existence a new er a, a new dawn of unique world power.\" 119 The expert on America's Secret Establishment — The Order of Skull & Bones is Antony Sutton.

The au thor of America's Secret Establishment, Antony Sutton, remarks that t he American Historical Association, the American Economic Association, the American Chemical Society and the American Psychological Association are \"key associations for the conditioning of society.\" 122 Records show that the Order of the Illuminati was c losely intertwined with Masonry. In fact, Abbe Augusten de Barruel, a refugee from Revolutionary France, discovered that the members o f the Order of the Illuminati were the secret Masters of Masonry. 123 Indeed, \"Members of the Order could be found only in the Lodges of Masonry. \" 124 Furthermore, Barruel, an Edinburg scholar, said that members of the Order \"insinuated themselves into all public offices, and particularl y into the courts of justice.\" 125 In similar fashion to Skull & Bones being secretly founded at Yale, Antony Sutton explains that a similar British \"Esta blishment\" was founded at Oxford University and the secret society there i s referred to as \"The Group.\" Sutton states that \"the Astor name is promi nent in \"The Group\" in England...\" 126 Recall it is the Yale graduates' Lord, Day and Lor d law firm which represented the Astor family's interests in t he U.S. 127 A businessman and revolutionary, Gerrit Smith, and his father were business partners with John Jacob Astor from the be ginning of Astor's career in 1784.

I intend to rout you out, and by the Eterna l God I will rout you out. If the people only understood the rank injustice of our money and banking system, there would be a revolution before morning! \" 133 For many years Astor made his primary residence in Geneva, Switzer land, close to the Gallatins. 134 Albert Gallatin's son James eventually took over f rom his father the management of the Astor family fund. Gen eva was the home of the League of Nations and is now the home of the su per-secret Bilderberger group. Perhaps not so coincidentally, Switzerland is the only country which is not a member of the United Nations . Senator William W.

He called America \"not a fit place for a gentleman.\" 135 William Astor's son Waldorf Astor was a member of L ord Milner's \"Kindergarten\" (a secret society) and a founder of the Round Table and Chatham House which spawned the Royal Institute for International Affairs. 136 Astor became the British delegate to the Assembly of the League of Nations in 1931 - the first attempt at wo rld government. 137 In 1935 he became the chairman of the council of the R oyal Institute for International Affairs. 138 Carroll Quigley, in The Anglo-American Establishment says, \"Since 1939 the chief benefacto rs of the Institute have been the Astor family and Sir Henry Price.\" 139 The Royal Institute for International Affairs was the predecessor to th e conspiratorial group which makes up America's controlling hierarchy toda y — the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).

For 16 years, Dulles was able to control what was published and much of what was talked about by the Presbyterian hierarchy. Joseph H.

In other words, the Dulles family was capable of contr olling not only what was written and thought about, but where the money was spent. Later, another member of the Dulles family, Joseph Dulles (1853- 1937), reorganized and supervised the Library of th e Princeton Theological Seminary.

This Oxfor d Conference published a book — The Univeral Church and the Worl d of Nations — which expressed the new organization's views on the need for the reordering of the world's political affairs under a world government. Lord Lothian of Great Britain's Chatham House wrote the lead article, \"The Demonic Influence of National Sovereignty,\" which p romoted the idea that national sovereignty was the cause of war. 145 It was this same pseudo-religious hypocrite, Lord L othian, who in 1935 and again in 1937, met with Adolph Hitler. No German churches were represented at the World Council of Churches c onference at Oxford in 1937. At that time, the official Nazi \"Christian \" church was called the Evangelical (Lutheran) Church.

I se e my role as trying to change the climate.\" 163 With a mindset like that, it is no wonder that lik e so many other shady Rockefeller projects, Union The ological Seminary was part of a Congressional investigation for Commu nist infiltration. It should be no surprise that a Union Theological stud ent was able to join the on-campus Atheists Club if he so chose. 164 Henry Sloane Coffin Jr. became a member of Skull & Bones in 1949, the same year George Bush was initiated. 165 Even though Henry Sloane Coffin Jr. was one of the \"Boston Five\" indicted on Federal conspiracy charges, he eventually took over the \"Red\" Riversid e Church.

It cannot work in an irre ligious country.\" 4 Speaking of Rauschenbusch, Major Edgar Bundy, in hi s book, Collectivism in the Churches, said, \"Socialism, thus, was his fi rst concern. Religion was only a means toward achieving socialism.\" 5 Thus, a great World Parliament of Religions was cal led in 1893 in Chicago \"to explore and strengthen the common groun ds of brotherhood which bind all men and which make them truly one in mind and heart.\" 6 The Congress was open to all the religions of the w orld and some three thousand invitations were issued. The Archbishop of Canterbury was indignant given \"that the Christian religion is the one religion...I do not understand how that religion can be regarded as a m ember of a Parliament of Religions, without assuming the equality of othe r intended members and the parity of their position and claims.\" 7 Liberal American Bishop Keane was delegated to sell the Catholic Archbishops on the concept of a religious \"parliame nt.\" At their annual meeting in New York, Bishop Keane pleaded, \"It is n ot in our power to hinder the Parliament from taking place. It is alre ady certain that all the other great forms of religion will be ably represen ted. Can the Catholic Church afford not to be there?\" 8 Apparently the Archbishops agreed, and instructed him to send twenty Catholic speakers to the Congress. To the directors of the Congress, Keane wrote: \"It is only by a friendly and brotherly comparison of convictions that reasonable men can ever come to an agreement about the all-important truths which a re the foundation of religion, and that an end can be put to the religio us divisions and antagonisms which are a grief to our Father in Heav en.

Authoring another statement for the F ederal Council of Churches entitled Soviet-American Relations, Dulles stated: \".. .Communism as an economic program for social re construction has points of contact with the social message of Christ ianity as in its avowed concern for the underprivileged and its insistence on racial equality ... neither state socialism nor free enterprise provide s a perfect economic system; each can learn from the experience of the o ther...the free enterprise system has yet to prove it can assure st eady production and employment...\" 32 (That is especially true for both the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. with Marxists running the system!) Communist Reverend Harry F. Ward said plainly on a broadcast May 21, 1946, that, \"The Soviet Union is progressing an d growing up economically and politically since the time of the Czars, while capitalist society is starving and going down.\" 33 Since we have now seen the collapse of the Soviet e conomy, we can guess what will happen to the American economy as t he social engineering protegees of Dulles like Clinton and Greenspan cont inue to tinker. Nevermind that the Christianity that Dulles adhered to ignored the mass murder of 20 million Russians in the first 25 years of Communist control and the 15 million additional who died in Soviet la bor camps thereafter, plus the 40 million in Russia, China, Hungary, Cuba , Poland, Tibet and Korea. Does anyone really doubt that our State Depa rtment could actively support genocide? And now consider the additional l oss of life in Iraq, Somalia, Rwanda-Burandi, Haiti and Bosnia. 158"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"The National and World Council of Churches An organization calling itself The American Council of Christian Churches attempted to offset the Communist influenc e of the Federal Council of Churches. They published a press release which disclosed: \"Radicals among churchmen and labor leaders had the ir way at the second conference on the Church and Economic Life sponsore d recently in Detroit by the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in Ame rica. Conservatives, who constituted a very small minority among the 460 delegates attending, battled against the powerful drive of those who wou ld take us closer and closer toward a 'Welfare State'.. .\" 34 The fact that this was written in 1950 gives us a clue as to why the church is so liberal today. When Communist organizations are exposed for their radical activit ies they routinely change their name. The Federal Council of Churches changed its name to the National Council of Churches (NCC) on November 28, 1950. 35 John Foster Dulles was a founder of the infamous Co uncil on Foreign Relations and was Eisenhower's Secretary of State. Eisenhower, in typical Masonic style, laid the cornerstone for the new bui lding of the National Council of Churches, which just happens to stand ac ross the street from the Rockefeller Riverside Church. The National Council of Churches' building and the Riverside Church are even connecte d by an underground tunnel! 36 Riverside has been a cesspool of Communist activit y for years. As a matter of fact, the prestigious Riverside Chur ch on New York City's Upper West Side was endowed by the Rockefellers to the tune of $50 million. 37 Dr. Emanuel M. Josephson explained in his book, Ro ckefeller, \"Internationalist\", The Man Who Misrules the World, that under the tutelage of Nelson Rockefeller and John Foster Dull es the churches involved were carried further into politics and to the Left. 38 On October 15, 1953, the National Council of Church es held a testimonial meeting at Carnegie Hall to honor Dr. H arry Ward on his 90th birthday. Dr. Ward, long active with the NCC and it s predecessor, the Federal Council of Churches, had been officially id entified as a member of the Communist Party; and was a close friend and con fident of Eugene Debs, Founder of the U.S. Socialist Party, and Will iam Z. Foster, head of the Communist Party of America. He was head of Unio n Theological Seminary for many years and is credited with influe ncing many ministers toward the \"Social Gospel\" and the Communist Party. 39 By 1960, a controversy developed over an official U .S. Air Force Reserve Training Manual which warned Air Force pers onnel that Communists, their dupes and sympathizers had infilt rated into churches. Congress again investigated. Richard Arens, staff d irector of the House 159"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances Committee on Un-American Activities, testified duri ng hearings as to the evidence of Communist activity in the religious fie ld. Arens revealed: \"Thus far of the leadership of the National Council of Churches of Christ in America, we have found 100 persons in lea dership capacity with either Communist-front records or records of servic e to Communist causes. The aggregate affiliations of the leadershi p, instead of being in the hundreds as first indicated, is now, according to t he latest count, into the thousands, and we have basis of authoritative sourc es of this committee, that the statement that there is infiltration of fe llow travelers in churches and educational institutions is a complete understatement.\" 40 An independent group of Methodist clergy and laymen , the Circuit Riders, Inc., analyzed the influence achieved in th e Church by the pro- Communists. The Circuit Riders compiled and publish ed names of over 7000 ministers and theological school professors wh o have supported Communist fronts and causes. Not only is this bad e nough, but where do you suppose these traitors are? Stormer, in None Da re Call It Treason shares our worst nightmare: \"In typical Fabian and Communist fashion they hold positions of influence and control far ou t of proportions to their numbers.\" 41 They make up the hierarchy! The Congressional hearings cited a number of Commun ist fellow travelers who were in the ministry. Included were: Walter Russell Bowie (affiliated with 33 Communist fronts and causes), H enry J. Cadbury (9 Communist fronts and causes), George Dahl (18 Commu nist fronts and causes), Leroy Waterman (20 Communist fronts and ca uses) and Fleming James (25 Communist fronts and causes). 42 These five men together with 25 others who have supported Communist causes, serv ed on the committee of 95 Bible scholars, translators, and theologians who produced the Revised Standard Version of the Holy Bible! 43 It is these \"theologians\" who laid the foundation for current attacks on the validity of the Virgin Birth of Christ and the questioning of the Deity of Christ which are classified as \"modernist\" and currently propelled i n LIBERAL seminaries, churches and political-social circles. Walter Russe ll Bowie, Henry J. Cadbury (Harvard), George Dahl (Yale) and Leroy Wat erman (University of Michigan) were all affiliated with the National Federation for Constitutional Liberties (NFCL). The House Committe e on Un-American Activities officially reported: \"The NFCL is one of the viciously subversive organizations of the Communist Party.\" 44 The report further states: \"In 1961 the United Youth Movement of the NCC (Nati onal Council 160"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"The National and World Council of Churches of Churches) published a pamphlet by William Cole G raham, called 'The Meaning of Sex in Christian Life.'

The Alabama Legislative Commis sion summarized the National Council Churches' report with the foll owing: \"Contrary to popular belief, the 'National Council of Churches' does not operate as a 'Super Church' and is more of a po litical pressure group than a religious federation.

Manning Johnson, once a top Communist official, rei nforced this documentation in his testimony during the investiga tion of Communist activities in the New York area. He stated: \"Once the tactic of infiltrating religious organiza tions was set by the Kremlin, the actual mechanics of implementing the ' new line' was a question of following the general experiences of th e living church movement in Russia where the Communists discovered that the destruction of religion could proceed much faster t hrough infiltration of the church by Communist agents operating within the chu rch itself...In the earliest stages it was determined that with only sm all forces available it would be necessary to concentrate Communist agents in the seminaries and divinity schools. The practical conclusion, dra wn by the Red leaders, was that these institutions would make it possible for a small Communist minority to influence the ideology of future clergy men in the paths most conducive to Communist purposes... The plan was to make the seminaries the neck of a funnel through which thous ands of potential clergymen would issue forth, carrying with them (in varying degrees) an ideology and slant which would aid in neutralizing the anti-Communist character of the church and also to use the clergy to spearhead important Communist projects. This policy was successful bevo nd even Communist expectations!... It is my conviction, as a former leader of the Communist Party, that those who lead our Nation mus t expose this plot and the Communist pattern of operation within our churc hes.\" 47 John Stormer in his well-documented book, None Dare Call It Treason - 25 Years Later, says: \"The National Council of Churches, its subordinate organizations, and 161"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances the leaders of many of its affiliated denominations and their publications consistently parallel or follow the Communist Party line, as exposed by J.

In the foreward of his book, The Triumph of the Therapeutic — Uses of Faith After Freud, he explained how society has been reorganized: \"The long period of deconversion... by which Christ ian culture has been displaced.. .which first broke the surface of political history at the time of the French Revolution appears all but ended . (Rieff understands the power of the Masonic - Illuminati influence on French and European, i.e., Western Civilization.) The central symbolism of personal and corporate experience seems to me well on its way to being differently organized with several systems of belief competing for primacy in the task of organizing personality in the West.\" 49 Rieff, in referring to the Communist psychiatrist W ilhelm Reich, said that, \"The chief institutional instrument of repres sive authority is the family. As a political revolution must overthrow th e power of the state, moral revolution must overthrow the power of the fa mily — all families. Reich makes the standard point: the family, being t he training ground of morality, is authoritarian by definition. It is the 'factory of reactionary ideology and structure'.. .A revolution must sweep out the family and its ruler, the father, no less cleanly than the old pol itical gangs and their elders. However radical the revolution, so long as the fami ly persists, authority will creep back.\" 50 How better to destroy the authoritarian father role and the family than to foster and fertilize what we have come to know a s feminism. Rieff added, \"The destruction, then, of the ancient mysti que of fatherhood defines the revolutionary task. For this eminently theoretical reason, Reich became a fierce feminist...Because 'political reaction favors the patriarchal theory,' Reich supposed that matriarchy must be the 'natural' and free form of social organization...The patriarc hal family became the main device for suppressing freedom...\" 51 In a sworn statement before the House Un-American Activities 162"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"The National and World Council of Churches Committee, the Reverend Shik-Ping Wang, East Asia D irector of the Baptist Evangelization Society International, descr ibed how the commune system established in Red China destroyed the famil y. He explained that, \"The family unit is broken up...The children are ta ken away from the parents and placed in government-run nurseries...Th e parents may see their children once a week and when they see them t hey cannot show affection toward the children. The idea is to have the children and the family sever their affection and direct it toward t he state. Names are taken away from the children and they are given numbers. There is no individual identity...\" 52 Reverend Wang continued, \"The commune system is des troying morality in Red China: There is no morality because the love of the family is taken away. There is no honesty and respect amon g men or between men. There is no human dignity: they are all like a nimals. There is no guilt associated with murder of individuals for the impro vement of the state.\" 53 Note that this is the same China which David Rockef eller visited in 1973. After his visit Rockefeller was quoted by the socialist New York Times as saying, \"The social experiment of China un der Chairman Mao's leadership is one of the most important and s uccessful in human history.\" 54 This is despite the fact that the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee released a report documenting as many as 64 million persons killed by Chinese Communists under Mao. 55 How else to destroy the family? Philip Rieff of the National Council of Churches again promoted the ideals of the Communist psychiatrist Reich. He said: \"Set into the context of Reich's attack on the fami ly as the nucleus of all authoritative institutions, his repeated calls for a do-it-yourself adolescent sex education acquires political signifi cance. Sex education becomes the main weapon in an ideological war again st the family: its aim was to divest the parents of their moral author ity.\" 56 Rieff concluded \".. .William Reich is one of the great th eorists of the child as the agent of social change...\" 57 John D. Stormer, in None Dare Call It Treason, 25 Years Later, says, Rieff's book, promot ing Reich's theories, was widely available to high school guidance counse lors as early as 1967- 1968. 58 We already have evidence of \"the child as an agent of social change.\" According to Andrea Barcena, director of Mexican Ri ghts, one-quarter of all the Mexican children who do not go to school — that is, 1 million of the 4 million who are outside the school system — a re involved in 163"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances trafficking or growing narcotics. Barcena says chil dren who live in extreme misery do this because they receive $100 fo r acting as \"burritos,\" that is, little donkeys, carrying heroin. The National Council of Churches' route to \"christi anize\" children was to sponsor a booklet written in 1961 which discusse d society's \"arbitrary\" rules for sexual behavior. It claimed: \"Both Jesus and Paul were seeking to set men free f rom this sort of legalistic bondage...For the Christian there are no laws, no rules, no regulations...Life is a series of grays and not pur e blacks and whites.\" 59 (Was it this kind of lukewarmness by which Jesus ga ve His life for mankind and the reason for which so many saints of the Chur ch have been martyred?) The booklet, Called to Responsible Freedom: The Mea ning of Sex in the Christian Life, sold sex by saying: \".. .We know.. .that there is sexual contact betwee n unmarried couples that is motivated by love and which is pure and on occasions beautiful. \".. .the crucial question to be asked about any sex ual contact.. .is not so much what is done but what is meant...What justifie s and sanctifies sexuality is not the external marital status of the people before the law but rather what they feel toward each other in their he arts.\" 60 United Church of Christ minister, Larry Beggs, says \"Young people as sexual beings have sexual rights...If the pill were allowed, young people could assume this responsibility!\" 61 Certainly Karl Marx's dream of using public schools as a tool in his campaign to destroy the family has been expanded to include the churches as well. Marx's partner in crime, Friedrich Engels' proposal to destroy the family included exactly the items that are accepted in America today as perfectly normal: \".. .the return of women to the f actories, free and easy divorce, the elimination of sex roles, the transfor mation of housekeeping into a social industry, the communalization of chil d care, the elimination of the concept of 'illegitimacy,' an open definition o f 'family,' and unrestrained sexual activity.\" 62 It was Marx who said: \"Communism abolishes all eter nal truths, it abolishes all religion, and all morality, instead o f constituting them on a new basis; it therefore acts in contradiction to al l past historical experience.\" 63 This is the same theme as the New World Order. Her e's what the New World Order believes: The state is sup reme — in individual lives, in family life, in morals, in religion, in g overnment and in the economics of making a living; in other words, Georg e Bush and the rest of his closeted Marxist friends believe in Communism! 164"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"The National and World Council of Churches As would be expected, it was another member of the Federal (now National Council) of Churches who promoted the deve lopment of a one- world religion by founding the National Conference of Christians and Jews in 1928. 64 Founders were S. Parkes Cadman and once Supreme Co urt Justice and member of the Council on Foreign Relati ons — Charles Evans Hughes. Founder S. Parkes Cadman was president of t he Federal Council of Churches from 1924-1928. He was a Freemason and a member of Independent Royal Arch Lodge No. 2, New York City, and grand chaplain of the Grand Lodge of New York for 28 years. In typ ical Masonic style, he was noted for his broad and liberal attitude with r egard to the religious opinions of others. He was also a member of the Mar xist group of one- worlders, the Council on Foreign Relations. In 1927 at Ft. Wayne, Indiana, Dr. Cadman said: \"Is it not true that our exclusion of people with advanced ideas like the Bo lshevists shows that we are afraid of them and changes they might bring abo ut?\" 65 This praise was heaped on the same Bolshevists who were responsible for the annhilation of 60,000,000 Russian people! In response to this s tatement by Cadman, E.N. Sanctuary in Tainted Contacts stated: \"Dr. Cad man knows that a fundamental doctrine of Bolshevism is the necessity of over-throwing by violence all governments not committed to Communism . He knows that in the Bolshevist 'Chamber of Horrors' at Moscow a pro minent exhibit is the Constitution of the United States, inscribed: The m ost dangerous enemy of mankind.' He knows that Lenin and Trotsky and al l the major and minor Bolshevik prophets have declared that the United St ates is the chief obstacle to the world wide program of Bolshevism an d must be destroyed in order to make the Communist cause triumphant. \"Knowing all this, and that Christianity and all re ligions are marked for destruction by Bolshevism, Dr. Cadman pleads fo r the 'right' of Bolshevists to enter this country at will and preac h their insurrectionary program...\" 66 \"Preaching here the violent overthrow of the govern ment of the United States in order that there may be reared on the rui ns an atheistic, prescriptive and expropriating government like that of Soviet Russia is an abuse of free speech, rejected by the American inst inct of self- preservation.

Pinchot was a founder of the American Civil Liberties Union and active in aiding the Soviets during the early days of the Bolshevik Revolution. 68 Others who joined with The Order's Pinchot in foun ding the ACLU were Felix Frankfurter of the Council on F oreign Relations, William Z. Foster, head of the U.S. Communist Party , Dr. Harry F. Ward of the Marxist Union Theological Seminary and Roger Ba ldwin, a notorious front-man for the Communist Party. 69 In 1924, a book by R.M. Whitney called The Reds in America made its appearance. Mr. Whitney quoted the 1920 Lusk Committee report concerning the ACLU: \".. .The effect of the activities of the American Civil Liberties Union is to create in the minds of the ill-informed people the impression that it is u n-American to interfere with the activities of those who seek to destroy Am erican institutions. They seek to influence legislators to protect the State of the Federal Government from the attacks of agitators.\" 70 The Lusk report adds, \"The American Civil Liberties Union, in the last analysis, is a supporter of all subversive movement s, and its propaganda is detrimental to the interests of the state. It attem pts not only to protect crime but to encourage attacks upon our institutions in e very form.\" 71 Reverend Cadman was born in 1864 in Wellington, Shr opshire, England and educated in London. Some of the best Co mmunists come out of London. The Daughters of the American Revolution (D.A.R.) fought Cadman and his brand of church socialism. According to its charter, the D.A.R. is, \"A society composed of women who are des cendants of ancestors all of whom with unfailing loyalty render ed material aid to the cause of American Independence as a recognized patr iot, as a soldier or sailor or civil officer in one of the several colon ies or states.\" 72 Since its origin the D.A.R. has given unwavering support to e very measure safeguarding the nation's defense and protecting ou r sacred national institutions and policies. The D.A.R.'s offense, in the eyes of Dr. Cadman, was that they insisted that America should retain t he independence their American ancestors won from Rev. Cadman's British a ncestors. The Daughters of the American Revolution believed that, \"It would be a sad day for the American people if it did not prefer this k ind of American patriotism instead of the Internationalism of a Britisher misu sing his position of clergyman to disseminate propaganda for a defensele ss America.\" 73 166"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"The National and World Council of Churches We have already established that the Federal Counci l of Churches (which became the National Council of Churches) and the Council on Foreign Relations founded the National Conference o f Christians and Jews with the help of S.

There are interlocking connections and close workin g relationships between the National Council of Churches and the Fo reign Policy Association. 74 The Foreign Policy Association was organized in 19 18. In September 1960, the Americanism Committee of Waldo M.

Lord Lothian of Great Britain was s elected in 1937 to represent its views to the world. He was one of tho se elite Britains who believed that the underdeveloped, or non-white coun tries, must not be allowed to develop independent and modern manufactu ring industry. Anton Chaitkin, in Treason in America, states that, \"This genocidal prohibition against development has been as well, t he exact viewpoint of the World Council of Churches.\" 77 Chaitkin tells us that Lord Lothian was an intimate of Sir Samuel Hoare, who had arranged t he original financing of the fascist movement of Benito Mussolini. 78 Another insider was Lord Halifax, who opened the World Council of Churches c onference and who supposedly represented British Catholics at the con ference. The Vatican apparently didn't appoint or annoint Lord Halifax b ecause it refused to be represented there! 79 The World Council of Churches (WCC) was formed Augu st 23, 1948 in Amsterdam, Holland, with all Christian denominat ions lending their membership except for Catholics, Southern Baptists and Missouri Synod Lutherans. 80 \"Six co-presidents were named to run the show. Amo ng them was an American named G.

World Brotherhood, in its esteemed wisdom, determined tha t the West should cease to be suspicious of Communism. The New York T imes described the conclusions of a World Brotherhood meeting in Bern, Switzerland in August, 1958: \"We must recognize that the communist countries are here to stay and cannot be wished away by propaganda. All is not bad in communist countries. Western nations could learn from communi st experiments.

W e should try to eliminate the stereotype attitudes about, and suspi cion of, communism. We must assume that the communist side is not worse th an, but merely different from, our side.\" 83 This fits perfectly with the Billy Graham statement that \"there is religious freedom behind t he Iron Curtain and in all socialist countries.\" 84 Apparently agreeing with such foolishness, 400 laym en and 200 clergymen participated in the Fifth World Order Stu dy Conference in Cleveland, Ohio, November 18-21, 1958. They unanimo usly passed a resolution in favor of diplomatic recognition of Re d China and the seating of the Communist Chinese government in the United N ations. \"The World Conference was dominated bv officers, staff personn el and members of the General Board of the National Council of Chu rches.\" 85 J.

Henry Luce III and Iroquois Chief Oren R. Lyons are on the Board of Directors. Bill Moyers and \"Mother\" Te resa are sideline cheerleaders. 91 Also in 1966, the U.S. Inter-Religious Conference on Peace was held in Washington, D.C. which again propagandi zed for the \"brotherhood of man.\" The Kyoto Conference in 1970 hatched the World Conf erence of Religion for Peace which was accredited to the Unit ed Nations through the Office of Public Information.

In accepting the appointment, John D. in po ntificated: \"The average citizen doesn't appreciate the social and economic implications of population growth and what it does to the quality of all our lives. Rather than think of population control as a negative thing, we should see that it can be enriching.\" 111 We have been enriched now by over 32,000,000 abortions! One of the earlier repor ts of the Rockefeller Commission recommended \"...that present state laws restricting abortion be liberalized along the lines of the New York Stat e Statute, such abortions to be performed on request by duly licensed physici ans under conditions of medical safety.\" 112 Furthermore, the Rockefeller Commission suggested that \"federal, state, and local governments make fu nds available to support abortion services in states with liberalized statut es.\" 113 Now, under the new Clinton Health Care package (Socialized medicine is not new, it has been promoted since the 30's) abortions will be be paid for by the desensitized and anesthetized American taxpayers.

Why do these brazen Hollywood stars engage in the i nternal politics of other sovereign nations even though such meddling i s forbidden by our Constitution? Hollywood moguls are known for interf ering in national and international politics. In fact, the Hollywood elit e have a history of a running love affair not only with themselves but wi th Communism. There have been very few individuals who ever dared confr ont such a wealthy and powerful mob with one notable exception. That i ndividual was Myron Fagan, a Hollywood producer who lost his own career trying to warn us of the duplicity of the \"stars.\" In his startling book, Red Treason In Hollywood, pu blished in 1949, Myron C. Fagan exposed the undeniable fact that for years the film industry has been Communism's most effective front for the brain-washing of adults and children alike. In Red Treason he nam ed over 200 stars, directors, writers, and producers who have collabor ated against the best interests of the American people. The names he iden tified are documented and verified both by the House Un-American Activiti es Committee (HUAC) and the California Legislature's Un-American Activities Committee (CUAC) and even the FBI. The first Congressional hearing in 1947 resulted in prison terms for those who were acclaimed the \"Hollywood Ten.\" It wa s discovered that the Communists had marked America for conquest and used Hollywood to \"condition\" the American people to accept Marxism. Proof stems from the fact that in 1920, Moscow organized The Cinema Bure au of the International Union of the Revolutionary Theatre 5 — specifically with the intent to destroy America. Their focus was on the f ilm industry because it is efficient. One film can be shown simultaneously in thousands of theatres 181"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances and reach millions at the same time. Now television does the same job but even better. Fagan disclosed that, \"Hollywood was a captive of the Reds and Communism's most dangerous propaganda machine i n America!\" 6 He claimed further that \"Every statement I make...is d ocumented: either in Court Records, or in the files of the Attorney Gene ral of the United States, or in the files of Committees such as the House Un- American Activities Committee, the Jenner Committee, the McCarren Commi ttee, the California State Senate Fact-Finding Committee, etc .\" 7 When Myron Fagan exposed the treasonous members of the Film Industry, there were alibis and denials by Hollywoo d but at that time the American people were still free enough from the pow er of sophisticated forms of thought control to be able to perceive the truth. They poured out their condemnation and protests on Hollywood and it s sponsors. Today, however, after years of nearly thorough brain-washi ng, that is not likely to happen. Coincidentally, there is no law in the United State s of America for which a Communist or Communist sympathizer can be t ried for being a Communist. Earl Warren and his socialistic, pro-Com munist justices outlawed or emasculated any form of legislative ant i-communism. 8 Better yet for the socialists, there is a law which declar es a person guilty of slander and defamation if he calls an individual a Communist — unless it can be proven that he is officially a member of the Communist Party. Does this make sense? It is a crime to call a man a Comm unist but it is not a crime to be a Communist!? The Catholic Church used to (but no longer) automatically excommunicate the Catholic who embrac ed Communism. The American government, on the other hand, encoura ges it! William Z. Foster, at one time the tituler head of the American Communist Party, once explained the plan of the Com munists for America: \"No Communist, no matter how many votes he should s ecure in a national election, could, even if he would, become President of the present government. When a Communist will head the governme nt of the United States — AND THAT WILL COME JUST AS SURELY AS THE S UN RISES — the government will not be a capitalist gov ernment but a Soviet government, and behind the government will stand TH E RED ARMY — TO ENFORCE THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT.\" 9 If you think that is too far fetched, then the read er may want to get an update on why so many unmarked black (now white) he licopters have been flying around the skies of America and why America has between 500,000 and 1,000,000 foreign troops from former Communist nations on its soil. 182"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Hollywood and The Press You might just factor in also, the reduction of the military, the closing of our bases, the destruction of our B-52s, the dumping of our tanks into the sea, the loss of our industry's ability to build any def ensive weaponry and the fact that many of our servicemen have now been vacc inated with harmful if not fatal infectious anthrax vaccines.

At the t ime of Myron Fagan's proclamations of Communist subversion in Hollywood, the \"stars\" needed to reduce the national tension developing over the exposure of their Communist activities. In response they sent goodwil l ambassadors to be honored guests at luncheon meetings of America's Wo men's clubs, Kiwanis, Rotary, Lions etc. to pronounce the lie th at \"Communism has been cleaned out of Hollywood.\" 51 Now who do you suppose was chosen to travel around the country and deceive the American people into believing that Hol lywood was now cleansed of all subversive activity? You might be s urprised to know that it was none other than the actor Ronald Reagan, who wa s then the President of the Screen Actors Guild! 52 Was he just continuing his acting career when he later performed for the nation as a strong anti-Communist? Let's review his theatrics. Reagan's act went like this: \"Communism failed in Hollywood because the overwhel ming majority of the members of the Screen Actors Guild, the Screen Writers Guild, the Directors' guilds and the workers in the Hollywood studio craft unions are and always have been opposed to communis m.. .We fought them on record and off the record. We fought them i n meetings and behind the scene...Blah, blah, blah...\" 53 Proving the Reagan act was a sham, a few weeks afte r Reagan said these words (July 27, 1951) the House Un-American A ctivities Committee again charged Hollywood with treasonous activites. Many of the \"star\" personalities hid behind the Fifth Amendment. Other s cooperated and confirmed the subversive activity of their treasono us brother and sister entertainers. F.O. Matthiessen, who was waiting to be called to t estify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, told Don ald Ogden Stewart, who belonged to the left wing of the Screen Writers Guild: \"As long as we have somebody from Bones who can bring pressure on the committee, I think we'll be all right.\" Both Matthiessen and Ste wart were members of 190"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Hollywood and The Press The Order of Skull & Bones! 54 The Illuminati strikes again. This time in Hollywood! Reagan got along well with both the entertainment i ndustry and the banking cartel. One of the most vigilant anti-Commu nists of all time, Gary Allen wrote: \"Probably the most damning indication that the President [Reagan] may be in the pocket of the megabankers is his unrelenting personal support for the bill (which passed) author izing an increase of $8.4 billion in America's 'contribution' to the Internat ional Monetary Fund. This money would in turn be 'loaned' by the IMF to deadbeat Third World governments to help them make interest payments on the gargantuan debts they owe to the Big Banks. Sadly, the Reagan admini stration even opposed and defeated an amendment to the bill which would h ave banned the use of such funds to bail out Communist regimes.\" 55 This did not surprise conservative Californians who knew Reagan's history. After World War II, Reagan played an up-fr ont role in an organization called the California League for A Dem ocratic Far Eastern Policy. It was linked to the Institute for Pacific Relations (an extension of the Council on Foreign Relations) and its drive to bring Mao Tse Tung into China by forcing a change in U.S. Policy toward Chi ang Kai Shek. It succeeded. Mao took over in China, and the mainland fell under the Red Chinese. Without Mao, there would have been no Kore an or Vietnam War. Reagan's actions, then, were felt in U.S. foreign p olicy well before his presidency! 56 Moreover, since Reagan was a Rockefeller admirer, there is no doubt that he would follow through with the Rock efeller philosophy to install socialist-Marxist governments all over the world. Ed Asner was the president of the Screen Actors Gui ld from 1981- 1985. He is another Guild member who promotes world socialism as an advocate and honorary sponsor of the World Constitu tion and Parliament Association which candidly and overtly promotes wor ld government and uses the threatening language — the \"New World Orde r.\" 57 Not only entertainers, but many of our news reporte rs have strong ties to Communism as well. The June 6,1992 issue of Huma n Events reported that \"a retired high-ranking KGB officer with exten sive knowledge about operations against the United States identified the late American journalist I.F. Stone as a paid KGB agent.\" 58 Only three years before, in 1989, Peter Jennings made this KGB agent the \"Person of the Wee k\" and praised his determination \"to write the truth, to defend the we ak against the strong, to fight for justice.\" 59 It just so happens that I.F.

No one does it better than Donahue. Donuhue even teamed up with fellow socialist Vladim ir Pozner on October 18, 1991 so that Pozner would have a forum to launc h an attack on captalism. 61 Donahue wouldn't think of having anyone normal on his show, nor does he care to reflect on any of America 's past traditional values. Those people who watch his show are rapidly losing their own values although they don't likely realize it. Phil Donahue, by the way, is one of Rush Limbaugh's largest promoters. On one of Donahue's carnival shows was a former cab le-TV saleswoman named J.Z. Knight. Knight is purported t o be the human channeler for a New Age guru named Ramtha. Ramtha s upposedly speaks marvelous words, exhorting the audience to know tha t each one of them is God and that nothing they do is evil, because there is no good and evil in human nature. He scorns the teachings of Jesus, cyn ically proclaiming that because each person is God, they do not need anyone else to teach them. Ramtha also reveals that \"in the seed of Lucifer li es God and divineness.\" 62 Many prominent success and positive-thinking semina r leaders and entertainment personalities like Melanie Chartoff h ave endorsed the blasphemous book entitled A Course in Miracles. Cha rtoff is a New Ager who gained a measure of fame in ABC's \"Fridays,\" an d told an interviewer how she hailed her fellow actors and performers, co mmenting, \"I'm thankful I'm part of an industry that's at the vang uard of putting New Age platitudes into practice.\" 63 Isn't this the same industry that for most of this century has been at the vanguard of putting socialist-Communist platitudes into practice? If so, then isn't it logi cal to ask the question: Aren't the Communist representatives of Hollywood m anufacturing, packaging, marketing, and selling us the New Age?

For those offended by the usage of the ancient and outd ated word Communism, you may substitute the word democracy which is what they call contemporary Communism now.

To adm it that it exists, but expect that it shall not be used, is un reasonable.\" 75 This has been going on a long time since Propaganda was first published in 1928!

He even clarified what this new period of hist ory we are entering would be like: \"At the same time the capacity to assert social and political control over the individual will vastly increase. It will s oon be possible to assert almost continuous control over every citizen and to maintain up-to-date files, containing even the most personal details ab out health and personal behavior of every citizen in addition to the more c ustomary data. \"These files will be subject to instantaneous retri eval by the authorities. Power will gravitate into the hands of those who control information. Our existing institutions will be supp lanted by pre-crises management institutions, the task of which will be to identify in advance likely social crises and to develop programs to cop e with them.\" 77 Note that Brzezinski indicates that information is contr olled. That means that only the information that the elite want us to have is the information that \"leaks\" out. Not only is our information controlled , but so is our history, our religion, and our science. So much for truth an d righteousness in the New World Order. National Security Advisor Brzezinski also explained how the many talking heads like Ted Koppel, Dan Rather and so ma ny others are used. He disclosed that, \"In the technetronic society the trend seems to be toward aggregating the individual support of millions of u norganized citizens, who are easily within the reach of magnetic and attract ive personalities, and effectively exploiting the latest communication tec hniques to manipulate emotions and control reason.\" 78 One of the most recent attempts to manipulate emotions and control reason has been the onslaught of movies, news reports and films clammering that aliens are r eal and are a potential threat to mankind. Again, Hollywood has done a fine job in making the unreal seem real. That is what Hollywood and all il lusionists are paid to do — create illusion. Apparently people do not remembe r that only a short time ago anyone caught entertaining an idea such as this was considered an oddball at least and more likely a nutcase. Similar ly, we need only recall that just a few years ago, the U.N. was considered an organization which should be de-funded and better yet thrown away. Now the great United States of America must plead and beg its case with the gods and goddesses of the U.N. to get permission to bake a cake. Brzezinski also gave us a frightful vision of the f uture.

PARKES CADMAN 4 Here we have proof that the \"Reverend\" Cadman of th e Federal Council of Churches, promoted the New Age as long a go as 1927! While all the media attention is on the corruption in the political system, the financial system and the decadence of H ollywood, little attention has been placed on the arena in which the greatest of all battles has been and will be fought. That is, the insidious infiltration of like- minded conspirators into the churches of our land w ith the intent of wreaking havoc on the gospel of the Lord Jesus Chri st. Nothing has been left out. There is no respect even for God Himself. The author of the Aquarian Conspiracy, Marilyn Ferg uson, shows great insight into exactly how a politico-religious consp iracy would take place. She says that \"A leaderless (unseen) but powerful n etwork is working to bring about radical change in the United States. It s members have broken with certain key elements of Western thought, and t hey may even have broken continuity with history.\" 5 Whose elements of Western thought have been broken with? Ferguson says \"Not unexpecte dly, some religious groups see the emergent spiritual tradition as a fe arful threat to the Judeo- Christian tradition...\" 6 She admits the network is huge: \"They have coalesced into small groups in every town and insti tution. They have formed what one called 'national non-organizations.' Some conspirators are keenly aware of the national, even international, scope of the movement and are active in linking others.\" 7 These non-organizations that Marilyn Ferguson referred to are now known as NGO's — non-government al organizations. These were the many groups urged to work together b y Hillary Clinton on her recent excursion to a feminist retreat in Commu nist China. Marilyn Ferguson admits, \"There are legions of cons pirators. They are in corporations, universities and hospitals, on the faculties of public schools, in factories and doctors' offices, in stat e and federal agencies, on 201"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances city councils and the White House staff, in state l egislatures, in volunteer organizations, in virtually all arenas of policy-ma king in the country.\" 8 Ferguson claims that \"Whatever their station or sop histication, the conspirators are linked...\" 9 According to Marilyn Ferguson, The National Institu te of Mental Health, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and the Department of Defense promote Zen, Transcendental Meditation, and other New Age techniques. Ferguson should know since she was a ke ynote speaker at the 1982 Department of Defense annual dinner. Her book, The Aquarian Conspiracy, describes New Age infiltration which in cludes members of the Cabinet, the White House staff, congressmen, and ev ery level of government. She explains that, \"In bureaucracies, in every corn er of government, human beings conspire for change. An Aquarian Conspirator at the cabinet level of the United States government helped foster departme ntal change by setting up staff workshops in human development, saying, 'If y ou want to change bureaucracies, you have to first change bureaucrats .' \" 10 The change has already taken place and the United S tates of America is paying the price — literally! On March 6,1995, News week reported that the Department of Transportation (DOT) and more specifi cally, the FAA was spending taxpayers' money on \"New Age\" training pro grams. Newsweek addressed the problem this way: \"This week the DOT' s inspector general is expected to unveil a two-year investigation into ch arges that the FAA channeled at least $1.4 million to a Ramtha followe r to run 'stress management' training programs for the agency.\" 11 Here's what Newsweek says the government of the U.S. is up to when no on e is watching: \"Employees of a private firm hired to run the FAA's management-training center in Florida said they were tied together with strips of bedsheets for 24 hours at a time. One former instructor, Helen Murph y, said she was forced to share a bed with her (male) boss; three women tr ainees had to shower together, and two men had to visit the toilet tied to each other. FAA personnel attending official sessions were reported ly deprived of sleep and verbally abused. One FAA controller who filed suit complained that he'd been forced to run a 'gantlet' of women who groped him and made sexually demeaning comments. The FAA has already paid $75,00 0 to a female controller who claimed she suffered 'extreme trauma ' during a 'diversity' workshop.\" 12 As if that's not enough, Newsweek also disclosed t hat this may not be a unique situation. Rep. Robert Dornan, chairman of a House committee on military personnel, planned to investi gate diversity-training programs throughout the armed forces. 13 202"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"The New Age One of those who fosters the Aquarian occult age is Republican Senator Arlen Specter. In 1991, Specter introduced a bill designed to force all U.S. citizens to come under the authority of a U.N.-created International Criminal Court. For this traitorous act, Senator Sp ecter was heartily commended by the World Federalist Association, a gr oup that has long pushed for One World Government. 14 Specter is not only a member of the Council on Foreign Relations but he is also a membe r of the Masonic Pennsylvania E. Coppe Mitchell Lodge No. 605. 15 Another senator who performed well as a change-agen t is Senator Mark Hatfield. Hatfield, as mentioned before, was a memb er of the radical- extremist group — the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS). Senator Mark Hatfield (R-OR) is a promoter of the New Age and hi s endorsement is on the back cover of the New Age book, Earthkeeping. 16 Hatfield has also written enthusiastic endorsement for many New Age-oriented \"Christian\" books. Hatfield introduced zero population growth legislat ion into the United States Senate and supports the New Age group Friends of th e Earth which promotes genocidal global de-population. According to New Ager Mark Satin's New Options Newsletter, April 1984, Hatfiel d had one of the top four scores in the United States Senate for voting affir matively on New Age issues. The other three top New Age supporters were Gary Hart of Colorado, Sparks Matsunaga of Honolulu, Hawaii and Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island. 17 According to U.S. News & World Report (December 5, 1988) Pell, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has sought to communicate with his dead relatives. The February 1 995 Intercessors for America Newsletter disclosed that \"Senators Dole an d Hatfield are leading the search for a successor for retiring Senate Chap lain Dr. Richard Halverson.\" 18 With backgrounds like that of New Age Freemason Ha tfield, and Dole, a 33rd degree Freemason, one can only ima gine what kind of \"chaplain\" will be chosen. Hatfield is also a Mason associated with Oregon Pacific Lodge No. 50. 19 Hatfield is a personal friend of Pat Robertson. Do birds of a feather really flock together? Another leader in the New Age Movement according to the New Age writer Mark Satin, is \"supposed\" Republican Conserv ative and now Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich.

Gingrich and Ne w Age leader Alvin Toffler jointly founded the Institute of Participat ory Democracy — an institute promoting the \"consensus process\" again s o dear to the hearts of New Age/globalist activists. 22 Gingrich is a frequent visitor to Pat Robertson's 700 Club and routinely attends Christia n Coalition meetings in Virginia. Gingrich is also a long time member of th e conspiratorial body — the Council on Foreign Relations. According to New Age researcher, Constance Cumbey, Robertson has given air time to a variety of New Age speakers. On e such individual is Jeremy Rifkin who wrote the book, Entropy. Rifkin s ays, \".. .There will be those who will see the Entropy Law as the truth tha t can set us free. The first group will continue to uphold the existing wo rld paradigm. The second will be without a world view. The third grou p will be the harbingers of the new age.\" 23 Rifkin also speaks about \"the world that is being born within us today.\" 24 He states that \"While the Entropy Law governs the world of time, space, and matter, it is in turn, governed by the primordial spiritual force that conceived it.\" 25 Is Rifkin calling Jesus Christ a primordial spiritual force or is he referr ing to another force? Whatever he is referring to, Rifkin supports a \"new world view.\" Showing his true nature, Rifkin says \"The radical change in world view required to make this transition will have to be accomplished v irtually overnight. There will be no time for polite debate, subtle com promise, or momentary equivocation. To succeed will require a zealous det ermination — a militancy, if you will — of herculean proportions.\" 26 This kind of thinking goes well with that of the In stitute for Policy Studies (IPS). Robert (Bo) Burlingham, a past member of the Marxist Weather Underground and an associate fellow of the IPS once stated: \"I do not believe that an equitable, just, free, democratic world ord er can be achieved in any other way but through violence.\" 27 And if we had any doubt, a Washington weekly newspaper, the Examiner, described the IPS a s a \"center which helped train extremists who incite violence in American ci ties\" and where \"educational research serves as a cover for intrigu e and political agitation.\" Rifkin does not say that the ultimate purpose of hu man life is to know God, to love God, and to serve God, but rather to e xperience the \"liberation that comes from becoming one with the universe.\" 29 This liberation theme is a constant with the New Agers and is consistent with the liberty 204"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"The New Age proposed by the terrorists that created the French Revolution and the Bolshevik Revolution.

The new order of the ages must begin w ith a revolution in science, education, and religion...\" 30 Pat Robertson's acquaintance, Jeremy Rifkin, is apparently — a Revolutionary! Rif kin also wrote The Emerging Order. In it he demonstrated how the New W orld Religion of the New Age would be brought into the church. There, sa ys Constance Cumbey, he made it clear that the \"evangelical chur ch would be their primary instrument to bring the new world order to birth.\" 31 John Naisbitt, another New Ager, has also been a gu est of the 700 Club. Newsweek Magazine reported \"...Naisbitt...[an d] Aburdene (his wife) in commendable New Age style...meditate toget her for 20 minutes each day. They...visit, occasionally, with a spirit ual adviser who gives them 'life readings.' Both also believe in reincarn ation and think the reason they get along so well together is that they knew e ach other in a previous life.\" 32 The Naisbitts presided over a four day New Age Ide as Festival at which John Naisbitt said, \"We have to reinvent virt ually the whole world we live in.\" 33 Vice-President Gore, then a senator and a friend o f the Naisbitts was also a speaker. Gore suggested at the festival that it was time to rethink the nation-state system. 34 Interpreted, that means it is time to destroy nationalism and more specifically — destroy America. We are re- inventing America, remember? And now even governmen t employees are questioning the status of their jobs. Another visitor to the 700 Club has been Robert Sch uller. Schuller preaches the gospel of \"self-esteem.\" He has had su ch notables on his Hour of Power as Norman Cousins. 35 Cousins, as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, was a co-founder of the radical one-world United World Federalists. 36 More recently, Cousins was a co-founder of the New *Author's addition. 205"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances Age group \"Planetary Citizens.\" 37 Pope John XXIII used Norman Cousins on several diplomatic missions for the Vati can. This was the same Pope John XXIII who annulled a directive of the Hol y Office of Pope Pius XII excommunicating all Communists and all persons cooperating with Communists. Last but not least, the psycholgist of Focus on the Family, James Dobson, also interviewed Norman Cousins. When local Colorado citizens called in to complain, Focus showed no int erest in their calls. The organization, Planetary Citizens, of which we w ill speak more later, has an interesting background. On April 7, 1 970, the Secretary- General of the United Nations, U Thant of Burma, \"p raised Vladimir I. Lenin, founder of the Soviet Union, as a political leader whose ideals were reflected in the U.N. charter.\" 38 U Thant's mentor, Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, had previously declared: \"If we now look back to history, we find that Stalin followed the right path.\" 39 U Thant, was co-founder of the New Age organization Planetary Citizens alon g with Norman Cousins and Donald Keys. Donald Keys was a former W orld Federalists' representative to the United Nations. 40 Donald Keys was one of the organizers and promoters of the pro- disarmament organization known as SANE for which ma ny Hollywood Communist sympathizers were condemned by the Congre ssional Un- American Activities Committee. The U.N. was charter ed by Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White both Communists and members of the conspiratorial Council on Foreign Relations. Donald Keys has free access to the U.N., a Communist organization, which demons trates that the New Age leaders don't mind working with the Communists. Keys once worked for Lucis Trust which was originally called Lucifer Publishing Company. 41 At a symposium entitled \"Toward a Global Society\" h eld in Asheville, North Carolina in 1984, Donald Keys announced, \"Don 't anyone think for a moment that you can run a planet without a head.. .This planet has to be managed.. .We have meditations at the United Nation s a couple of times a week. The meditation leader is Sri Chinmoy, and t his is what he said about the situation: '...The United Nations is the chosen instrument of God...'\" 42 If it is, I wonder which god has chosen this Commu nist organization to work through. Donald Keys is also a former president of the Inter national Center for Integrative Studies (ICIS). 43 The ICIS is described by George Christie as \"250 of the world's finest change agent scholars.\" 44 In a speech to Lucis Trust on December 5, 1983, Christie said they worke d very closely with the Club of Rome, a group of \"elites\" who have divi ded the world into ten 206"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"The New Age kingdoms which they intend to rule.

According to Christie, \"The Door\" requires \"conscious spiritual endeavor\" on the part of its staff. Service there is often mandatory for med ical and other professionals serving out mandatory residencies. 45 Constance Cumbey, in her book, The Planned Deception, informs us that on e of the private donors for this fund is none other than Mrs. Astor. What is the significance of Pat Robertson hob-nobbi ng with the likes of John Naisbitt, Mr. Possibility-Thinker Robert Sc huller, and Masonic occultists like Mark Hatfield, Bob Dole and now 33r d degree Freemason, Newt Gingrich. Does Pat Robertson take responsibili ty for what is being said on his station which reaches 30 million viewer s? It apparently poses no concern since on June 1, 1978, Robertson himself said \"..we must never equate the Bible with the perfect Jesus.\" 46 What does that infer? Is Robertson denying the inerrancy of God's word? 47 Another poorly understood fact of history is that Y ale University has a legacy of donating socialists who fuel the socialis t agenda in Congress and elsewhere. One obvious case in point is Hillary Cli nton. Given the legacy of Yale it might be revealing to know that Robertso n attended Yale University Law School and moreover, the London Scho ol of Economics. 48 It was the Fabian Society, whose goal was world so cialism, which established the London School of Economics. I n 1907, the Fabians even began a weekly review called the New Age. To discover how Robertson really feels about the oc cultic New World Order, we must look at his own writings. In his boo k, The Secret Kingdom, Robertson says we are in \"the time of transition fr om the old discredited world order into the time of emergence of the new.\" 49 Inside the front cover leaf, The Secret Kingdom assures us: \"There i s an invisible world of the spirit. It is possible to draw help from that i nvisible world. There can be a new world order.\" 50 On page 76 Robertson explains, \"It [the kingdom of heaven] demands an inner revolution of attitude and outlook. It turns ordinary ideas upside down. It sets the stage for a new world order.\" 51 On page 15 Robertson offers the questions: \"Is there truly an invisible world of the spirit?\" \"Is it possible to draw help from that invisible wo rld?\" \"Can there be a new world order?\" And the answer from Pat Robertson? — \"Yes.\" 52 207"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances Later, on page 88, Robertson again extends his prom otion of George Bush's occultic New World Order. The leader of mill ions of Christians says: A new world order is near.

Howev er, the evidence builds. In his book, The New Millennium, Robertson has a point within a circle symbol at the top of virtually every page of the book. The point within a circle is definitive occultic language for sun worship. It was also chosen as the symbol of the Illuminati. Symbols don 't jump onto books for no reason. This is a symbol meant for those who und erstand the language of symbols. More evidence piles up as we read Robertson's book, New World Order. On page 37, Robertson suggests that George B ush is a man of goodwill. Later, on p. 92 he reiterates that Bush i s \"an honorable man and a man of integrity.\" 55 The truth is that Bush is a member of the secret society known as the Order of Skull and Bones whose members promote an occultic one-world totalitarian government. If S kull and Bones is not itself the Illuminati, it's as close as you can get . Secondly, by now it should be obvious to all Americans that Bush is not a \"man of integrity.\" Bush was a liar. Robertson should remember Proverbs 6:17 whi ch lists lying as one of the sins which God hates. There is some evidence to show that Robertson is hi mself a member of that infamous secret society — \"the mother of them all\" — Freemasonry. On the cover of the February 17, 1986 issue of Time magazine, Robertson shows a pose known to Freemasons as the \"Lion's Paw .\" Robertson denies that his pose has anything to do with the secret so cieties, but if he is a member, he took the oath to \"ever conceal and never reveal any part or parts, arts or arts, point or points of the secret arts and mysteries of ancient Freemasonry which I have received.\" One other puzzling aspect of Robertson is his regar d for the United Nations as a viable organization. The United Nation s is first and foremost a known promoter of one-world totalitarian governme nt. In their own words they promote a New World Order without the Lo rd Jesus Christ. As 208"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"The New Age an advocate of Christ the King above all kings how can Robertson consider valid this anti-Christ association of Communists an d occultists? Robertson is not the only one, however, who legitim izes the United Nations whose charter was written by known Communis t and member of the Council on Foreign Realtions — Alger Hiss. In O ctober 1975 a convocation of spiritual leaders read this statemen t to the United Nations Assembly: \"The crises of our time are challenging the world r eligions to release a new spiritual force transcending religious, cultura l, and national boundaries into a new consciousness of the oneness of the human community and so putting into effect a spiritual dy namic toward the solutions of the world's problems...\" 56 The \"spiritual\" leaders indicated how this would be achieved: \"We affirm a new spirituality divested of insularity an d directed toward planetary consciousness.\" 57 Naturally, to develop planetary consciousness, there has to be a planetary plan to accomplish it. Since when has the U.N. become a \"spiritual\" organi zation? Most people believe the U.N. is a much needed conclave o f international representatives who care about world peace. But the U.N. is much more than that especially since it has now become the sp iritual government of the New Age. Former assistant secretary-general of the U.N., Rob ert Muller, plays a part in the spiritual theatrics. He says: \"I have c ome to believe firmly today that our future, peace, justice, and fulfillment, h appiness and harmony on this planet will not depend on world government but on divine or cosmic government.\" 58 His goal (now very far along) \"is to get a tremend ous alliance between all major religions and the U.N.\" 59 What kind of religion do you suppose this will be? How can the U .N. develop a new religion which will include religions which believe in God, religions which do not believe in God (Buddhism) and even agnostics and atheists? Don't think this hasn't been well thought out by those wh o have control of the press, media, and the government. The new gobal rel igion is a \"designer\" religion much like designer jeans. It is a religion where no one cares about religious doctrine since all religions are part of an amorphous libertine \"brotherhood.\" The common denominator decided upon by the global authority? - pantheism - known today as GAIA, in wh ich even the earth becomes sacred.

This is especially so as the U.N. busily disarms each nation's military and replaces its lea dership with its own style of dictator. Examples include Somalia, Haiti and no w Bosnia. All countries will eventually be forced to obey Muller's directiv e to: \"display the U.N. flag in all houses of worship.\" 63 Muller describes the new \"disarmed\" human family: \" The supreme unity of the human family.. .as seen by the great r eligions must now become a political reality; the hour has struck for the im plementation of a spiritual vision of world affairs; the next great task of hum anity will be to determine the divine or cosmic laws which must rule our behavior on this planet.\" If you didn't like the U.N. before, h ow do you like them choosing a religion for you? Better yet, designing a religion for you? Muller and his New Age cronies are not afraid of God since they believe that, \"happiness can be achieved by elevating oneself to God.\" 64 That is simply another way of saying \"I will not bow before You, L ord, since I also am God.\" On page 166 of New Genesis, Shaping a Global Spirituality, Muller says \"I could seek and feel in myself the entire un iverse and Godhead.. .\" 65 Although he claims to be divine and urges others to follow in his divine footsteps, Muller himself can only plead ign orance as to what is going on. He says that we are coming from somewhere and we are going to somewhere but he does not know where. Quite the omniscient analysis, don't you think?

Muller suggests tha t, \"the incarnated God, or Christ, is in all of us and for all of us to man ifest.\" 68 He says, \"...God saw humans restore God and the human person as the alpha and omega...\" 69 And since man is God he can take on Godlike qualit ies: \"Hence the need to believe in You [Man] as a great. ..limitless power, an all-encompassing mind...endowed with all the perfec tions we seek on earth.\" 70 Moreover, Muller tells man: \"Once again You [Man] are the light in the darkness.. .\" 71 and \"Be a cosmic, divine being.. .\" 72 In his book, New Genesis, Robert Muller prays, \"O G od, I know that I come from you, that I am part of you, that I will r eturn to you, and that there will be no end to my rebirth in the eternal s tream of your splendid creation.\" 73 Muller claims to be a Catholic but I can assure yo u that St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas would accuse him o f blatant heresy. Muller shows his true arrogant nature when he procl aims: \"If Christ came back to earth, his first visit would be to the United Nations to see if his dream of human oneness and brotherhood had come true.\" 74 He adds to the blasphemy when he says: \"I often visualize i n my mind another even more accurate painting: that of the United Nations which would be the body of Christ.\" 75 Imagine the shocked amazement in heaven at the bol d foolishness of such a statement! Meanwhile, Muller says the world's major religions must speed up their ecumenical movement a nd recognize the unity of their objectives in fostering a new world religious renaissance.

Juli ana had previously assumed the title of \"Protectress of the Craft,\" re ferring to Freemasonry. 87 Her husband, Prince Bernhard was a Nazi storm troop er and one of the founders of the super-secret Bilderbergers. Bernhar d, as a Bilderberger, held secret meetings with high U.S. officials, bank ers and industrialists to map plans for merging the United States and the Sov iet Union into a world government dominated by the elite. Another endorser of Planetary Citizens was Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren. Warren was head of the Warren Commissi on that investigated the murder of President John F. Kennedy. It is not coincidental that he was a thirty-third degree Mason. 88 Members of the Board of Directors of Planetary Citi zens include: Peter Caddy - founder of Findhorn - Scottish commun ity - \"Vatican\" of the New Age Norman Cousins - World Council of Wise Persons Aurelio Peccei - founder of the Club of Rome Theodore M. Hesburgh - advisory chairman - presiden t of Notre Dame University 89 Not long ago, at a speaking engagement, a young man in the audience indicated I had an anti-Catholic bias because I exp osed Hesburgh as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. What he failed to understand 213"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances is that Hesburgh is the one who has an anti-Catholi c bias and that he only poses as a Catholic leader to infiltrate and empowe r the movement of the one-worlders. In fact, the presidents of numerous w ell-known colleges and universities are members of the CFR and/or Masons. Actually, Hesburgh promotes the purposes of the Ant ichrist via his Planetary Citizens who serve as the \"vanguard for t he reappearance of the Christ.\" \"Hesburgh,\" said my inquisitor, \"is a nice guy.\" This author urges him and all the others who are caught up with plast icized \"nice guys\" to remember the admonition that Satan will appear as a n angel — an angel of LIGHT! Ervin Laszlo, is another member of the board of dir ectors of Planetary Citizens. It was Laszlo who wrote The Objectives of the New International Economic Order (1979). 90 CFR member Cyrus Vance, on March 30, 1970, indicate d that the United States would increase economic aid to develo ping nations to further \"progress toward a more equitable and healthy new i nternational economic order.\" 91 On September 15, 1980, a special session of the U. N. General Assembly ended that attempted to lay the groundwork for a New International Economic Order. The U.N. report, \"The New International Economic Order: A Spiritual Imperative,\" stated: \"O ver the centuries humanity has drawn a line of demarcation between wh at was considered human and what was considered spiritual. But what? A new understanding of spirituality is emerging which rec ognizes that all efforts to uplift humanity are spiritual in nature. \" 92 The U.N. report goes on: \"Alice Bailey said, 'That is spiritual which li es beyond the point of present achievement; it is that which embodies the vision and which urges man on toward a goal higher than the one attained.' In another context she said, 'The word spiritual relates to attitudes, to relationships, to the moving forward from one level of consciousness to t he next; it is related to the power to see the vision, even if that vision is materialistic as seen from the angle of a higher registration of possibility.. .' Given this new understanding of spirituality, the work of the Unit ed Nations can be viewed not only within a political and social spher e, but can be seen within the entire evolutionary unfoldment of humanity. The work of the U.N. is indeed spiritual and holds profound import for the future of civilization.\" 93 Unfortunately for the monotheistic religions of the \"Old World Order,\" the New World Order has determined that the old ord er must go. In September, 1980, The New International Eco nomic Order (World 214"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"The New Age Goodwill Commentary Number 14) was published emphas izing Alice Bailey's explanation that \"in the destruction of th e old world order and in the chaos of these modern times, the work of the new creation is going forward; the task of reconstruction, leading to a c omplete reorganization of human living.\" 94 Indeed, the Communist-founded United Nations has suddenly become very \"spiritual-minded.\" This spiritual \"revolution,\" however, will be prece ded by an economic revolution. Again, according to Bailey: 1. The principal of barter and exchange will control. 2. .. .national currencies will have been largely supe rseded, not only by a system of baiter but by a universal monetary exch ange.. .National material assets and the needed commodities will all be provided for under an entirely new system. (Now you know why NAF TA, GATT and the WTO had to be signed.) 3. ...The great public utilities, the major material r esources and sources of planetary wealth — iron, steel, oil and wheat (food).. .will be owned in the first place by a gov erning, controlling international group (a world government).\" 95 The political system draws its power from its \"univ ersality.\" There will be a \"universal\" credit card system, \"universa l\" health care, a World Tax authority, a World Court, a World Food Authorit y and a World Draft for the World Army which now includes NATO under th e U.N. This globalistic and occultic twilight zone has bee n in the planning stages for a long time. Alice Bailey, who was an In sider's insider wrote in 1942: \"Behind the divisions of humanity stand those Enlig htened Ones whose right and privilege it is to watch over human evolution and to guide the destinies of men. ..This they do through the im planting of ideas in the minds of the world thinkers, so that these ideas in due time receive recognition and eventually become controlling facto rs in human life. They train the members of the New Group of World Servers in the task of changing these ideas into ideals. These in their tu rn become the desired objectives of the thinkers and are then taught to t he powerful middle class and worked up into world forms of government or rel igion, thus forming the basis of the new world order, into which the ma sses are patiently incorporated.\" 96 Apparently Bailey knew of the article written in t he Rosicrucian Digest, June 1941, which said: \"We pred ict a mystical- pantheism as the religion of tomorrow.. .There will not be churches, but a church.\" 97 Simply put, this is spiritual propaganda! 215"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances The New Group of World Servers' official statement of purpose includes these four objectives: 1. Bring about world peace, guide world destiny and us her in the New Age. 2. Form the vanguard for the Reappearance of the Chris t and his Great Disciples (the Masters of Wisdom). 3. Recognize and change those aspects of religion and government which delay the full manifestation of planetary uni ty and love. (Now you understand why it's necessary to reinvent Ameri ca.) 4. Provide a center of light within humanity and hold the vision of the Divine Plan before mankind. 98 Communist leader Mikhael Gorbachev reinforces such new world order thinking. The media refers to socialism as de mocracy now, but all democracy ends eventually in anarchy and dictatorsh ip — hence, secular humanistic Communism. This, however, has a new twis t. It is not your normal atheistic Communism, but a new, improved spi ritually occultic Communism — Luciferianism. In 1988 while addressing the U.N., Gorbachev praised the \"tremendous impetus to mankin d's progress\" that came from the French and Russian revolutions, sayin g: \"World progess is only possible through a search for universal human consensus as we move forward to a new world order...\" 99 Gorbachev certainly must know that both the French and Bolshevist Revolutions were acc omplished by international Freemasonry working for the Illuminat i — \"the Illumined Ones.\" In fact, Gorbachev is himself a Freemason ac cording to James H. Billington of the Library of Congress. In Russia Tr ansformed: Breakthrough to Hope, Billington says: \"One of Russ ia's greatest art historians...told me in all seriousness...that all of Russia's troubles had begun when Gorbachev was initiated into a Masonic L odge by Margaret Thatcher during his first trip to London.\" 100 Commenting on the U.S.-Soviet \"partnership,\" column ist Gary Potter wrote in September, 1989 that, \"The convergence is more than economic and political. It also has its spiritual dimension; and, interestingly enough, that dimension corresponds to the esoteric side of the New Age movement, which is centered on the vision of all lands and pe oples coming together as One World to make a New Order. Reference is here be ing made to the spiritual dimension of the convergence and its corr espondence to New Age teaching because of the fact that the principle sponsor of Yeltsin's trip [to the U.S.] is the California-based Esalen Instit ute.\" 101 Yeltsin's trip was also partly underwritten by the Rockefeller Brother s Fund, and David 216"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"The New Age Rockefeller himself introduced Yeltsin to a luncheo n of 300 members of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). 102 In a September 11, 1990 address to the United Natio ns General Assembly, President Bush urged the nations of the w orld \"to press forward to cap a historic movement toward a new world order ...And so let it be said of the final decade of the twentieth century, this was a time when humankind came into its own...to bring about a revo lution of the spirit and the mind and began a journey into a new day, a new age, and a new partnership of nations...\" 103 This is the same George Bush whose \"revolution of the spirit\" and promotion of a \"new age\" doesn't bother Pat Robertson who calls Bush a man of integrity and goo d will. Apparently Robertson doesn't read his own Bible which admonish es: \"Bear not the yoke with unbelievers. For what participation hath justice with injustice? Or what fellowship hath light with darkness.? And w hat concord hath Christ with Belial? Or what part hath the faithful with the unbeliever?\" (2 Corinthians 6: 14,15) Bush later showed he speaks the \"esoteric\" language of the occult when in his State of the Union address to the natio n on January 29, 1991, he declared: \"What is at stake is more than one sma ll country (Iraq), it is a big idea — a new world order...to achieve the unive rsal aspirations of mankind...based on shared principles and the rule o f law...The illumination of a thousand points of light.. .The w inds of change are with us now.\" 104 This \"light\" language is nothing new for the occult . In 1944, Alice Bailey published Discipleship in the New Age in whi ch she said, \"The world today is in such a distressing condition that the major need in every country is the appearance of 'steadily shining poin ts of light' which can illuminate the way for others.\" 105 The New Age organization World Goodwill affirmed \"Unlike the repressive and purita nical misapplication of spiritual values in the past, these new values c an then be recognized as a liberating ...way of life. The individual whose l ivingness is expressed daily in terms of right values can be thought of as a point of light.\" 106 Just prior to the bloody French Revolution came the reso unding cry of the Illuminati through the Masonic Lodges of France for \"Liberty,\" \"Equality,\" and \"Fraternity.\" There is nothing new under the su n. Bush's reference to the \"rule of law\" is old elite language for developing the kind of language, culture and people you want by constantly changing the laws.

The traitors included Claiborne Pell, Alan Cranston, George McGovern, Robert Packwood, Christo pher Dodd, Paul Simon, Les Aspin, Pat Schroeder, Ron Dellums, and P aul Tsongas. 108 The document declares: \"Two centuries ago our forefathers brought forth a new nation; now we must join with others to bring forth a new world or der.. .Narrow notions of national sovereignty must not be permitted to cu rtail that obligation...We affirm that a world without law is a world without order.. .\" 109 This call for a world without national sovereignty goes back a long time. From the Grand Orient of France's own re cords, we read: \"It is the duty of universal Freemasonry to co-operate abs olutely with the League of Nations in order that it may no longer ha ve to submit to the interested influences of Governments.\"(1923) 110 The same year the Convention of the Grand Lodge of France dictated: \"The Commission demands that the Convention should unanimously note that in all manner of cases the League of Nations s hall henceforth have supreme authority to decide between peoples and Gov ernments.\" 111 The secret society of France also ruled, \".. .The inter national authority must be sanctioned by an army of international police. To d isarm separate States and arm the Federation of United States, these are two phases of the same program.\" 112 To accomplish the goal of world government, secrecy and indoctrination through brainwashing were paramount. The Grand Orient instructed its initiates: 1) \"Masonry must be felt everywhere, but must be found nowhere.\" 113 2) \"An active propaganda is urgent, so that Freemas onry shall again become the inspirer, the sovereign mistress of the ideas through *Author's addition. 218"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"The New Age which democracy (world socialism*) is to be brought to perfection.\" 114 Alice Bailey in her book, Externalization of the Hi erarchy, revealed that there is a new kind of war now taking place: \" Years ago I said that the war which may follow this one would be waged in the field of the world religions...it will be fought largely with mental w eapons and in the world of thought; it will involve also the emotional real m, from the standpoint of idealistic fanaticism (that is, the traditional chu rch*).

The churches of America are now filled with men who are conspirators or who themselves hav e been brainwashed in modernist seminaries and are being used to alter the Christian faith and doctrine of the pure Christian religion. What bette r way than to keep the people coming to church yet through the power of pe rsuasion and linguistic programming, sell New Age universal salv ation (\"We're all saved!\") which is nothing other than Marxism. According to Bailey, the New Age Christ will have t hree planned activities: 1. The reorganization of the world religions — if in a ny way possible — so that their out-of-date theologies, their narro w-minded emphasis and their ridiculous belief that they know what is in the Mind of God may be offset... 2. The gradual dissolution — again if in any way possi ble — of the orthodox Jewish faith, with its obsolete teaching.. .In saying this I do not fail to recognize those Jews throughout the world who acknowledge the evils and who are not orthodox in t heir thinking... 117 In The Rays and the Initiations, Alice Bailey stat es that the new messiah will not be Jewish because the Jews forfeited *Author's addition. 219"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances that privelege by not recognizing the former Messia h and that the Jews needed to learn humility more than any other p eople. 118 3. Preparation for a revelation which will inaugura te the new era and set the note for the new world religion. 119 How will this come about? The theme of the New Age is that man is divine; that is, that those in the New Age are a ra ce of gods in the making. The other montheistic religions are holding this \"d ivine\" race back from realizing its perfection. 120 Any religion or person who opposes the basic, humanistic concept that \"all is one\" is a threat to peace and the brotherhood of man. 121 Malachi Martin, in The Keys of This Blood, explains why Marxists and Communists have become so adept at selling the New Age: \"The Marxist ideal has always met its stubbornest rejection at t he hands of several large blocs (sic) of people — in many cases numbered in t he millions — who remained stoutly attached to a religious ideal to b e realized only in the afterlife. New Age, on the contrary, not only envis ages the ideal of the global village in the here and now. It serves the c lassic Marxist ideal by corroding and dissipating those blocs of traditiona l resistance to the notion of total control of human life and activity by all- powerful 'leaders' and 'instructors.' Like many other 'one world' groups n ew agers look forward to the elimination of existing political sy stems and national boundaries. They are prepared to welcome the subseq uent blending of all nations and peoples into one planetary culture, wit h a single court of justice, a single police force, a single economic a nd educational system — all under a single government dominated by a supe rbureau of 'enlightened ones.' \"Allowing for the necessary change of language, tha t is very nearly the formula set out bv Vladimir Lenin!\" 122 This is the same Lenin, who urged his followers to politicize the Church in order to neutralize its influence. He wou ld be proud of today's push for a new world order. Lenin once wrote: Marxism is materialism. As such it is without mercy for religion. Every religious idea, every idea of God, even flirting with the idea of God, is unutterable vileness. 123 Recalling who and how Lenin became established, the words of Antony Sutton, the author of America's Secret Estab lishment, ring in our ears: \"In brief, the creation of the Soviet Union s tems from The Order [of Skull & Bones]. The early survival of the Soviet Un ion stems from the Order. The development of the Soviet Union stems fr om The Order.\" 124 220"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"The New Age Pope Benedict XV foresaw the ominous trends toward world government and on July 25, 1920, warned that, \"This state.. .would banish all national loyalties.

If these ideas are put into practice, there will inevi tably follow a reign of unheard-of-terror.\" 125 So much for the veneer of love, peace and spirituality coming from the United Nations. Education In order to exploit the masses, H.G. Wells explaine d that a network would work best \"...consisting of a great multitude and variety of overlapping groups, but now all organized for colle ctive political, social and educational as well as propagandist action...\" 126 Wells described the Open Conspiracy as becoming \"a great world move ment as widespread and evident as socialism or communism.\" 127 Why wouldn't this be, since Luciferic Masonry and Atheistic Comm unism have fathered the NEW AGE! Wells went on to say: \"It [the New Age ] will largely have taken the place of these movements. It will be more , it will be a world religion...the \"new human community.\" 128 H.G. Wells told us that, \"The open conspiracy must begin as a movement of explanation and propaganda.\" 129 Alice Bailey, head of Lucis (Lucifer) Trust, told her followers, \"It must be re membered that the forerunner of all movements which appear upon the p hysical plane is an educational propaganda.\" 130 John Dunphy, in his essay, \"A Religion for the New Age,\" remarked, \"I am convinced that the battle for humankind's fut ure must be waged and won in the public school classrooms by teachers who correctly perceive their role as the proselytizers of a new faith: a r eligion of humanity that recognizes and respects the spark of what theologia ns call divinity in every human being. .. \"The classroom must and will become an arena of con flict between the old and the new — the rotting corpse of Christi anity, together with all its adjacent evils and misery, and the new faith... resplendent in its promise...\" 131 New Ager Marilyn Ferguson understands how this will be achieved because she understands better than most parents th e tremendous sway that teachers have over the \"great numbers of relatively powerless, vulnerable young people.\" 132 221"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances Phyllis Schlafly states in her book, Childhood Abus e in the Classroom: \"Our country was chosen... to implement the Global Studies Program...The goal of Global Education is to prepar e all youths to accept a world government for all systems and a glo bal interdependence.\" 133 One example of this educational mind manipulation occurred in Atlanta, Georgia where two Christian wo men who objected to their children being forced by teachers to lie in t he darkness and listen to hypnotic mind control tapes became the retaliatory target of angry teachers and educators. The local pastors refused to \"get in volved.\" Welcome to the apostate church! Texe Marrs, in Dark Secrets of the New Age says, \"A literal avalanche of religious filth has entered the classroom, broug ht in by those responsible to protect our children.\" 134 If you will recall the goals of the Illuminati and in our own century the goals of the Communist Party , you will understand exactly why this \"filth\" is in the school system. Former assistant secretary-general of the United Na tions, Robert Muller, has admitted that the demon spirit, \"the Ti betan,\" advised him on a core curriculum for the New Age, to be used in pu blic and private schools to teach children \"Global Education.\" 135 This is the same Robert Muller who was engaged to give major speeches to the Natio nal Catholic Education Association's 1985 annual meeting in St. Louis, Missouri. 136 This is also the same Robert Muller who called for an attempt to \"control press freedom worldwide.\" 137 This would come in the form of the New International Information Order (NIIO). Under the t erms of the New International Information Order, journalists operat ing across national boundaries would require UNESCO licensing. This sec ret society- dominated \"Information Order\" would give internatio nal control of press freedom to an agency dominated by Luciferian Alice Bailey's teachings! Constance Cumbey, a New Age researcher and author o f A Planned Deception states categorically that, \"The Bailey te achings are clearly anti- Catholic, anti-Protestant fundamentalist, and rabid ly anti-Semitic.\" 138 Publishing The obvious deduction is that secular publishing co mpanies which publish school books are promoting the New Age. Sin ce the Council on Foreign Relations has virtually a complete lo ck on the publishing 222"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"The New Age companies, the bookstores and the distributors, thi s is not difficult to imagine. What makes things worse, however, is that even so-called \"Christian\" publishing houses such as Word Incorpor ated of Waco, Texas are publishing New Age propaganda.

Sine also told a Vancouver audience it w as their Christian duty to support the New International Information Order (NIIO). 139 Word also published books with favorable references to Krishnamurti, a Hindu and a disciple of Theosophy. This is even t hough he himself renounced his position as the \"Great World Teacher. \" He was slated to become \"Maitreya the Christ\" in 1914 but the Americ an people and the people of the world had not yet been brainwashed en ough to accept another Christ. 140 Word has also helped to popularize the Catholic he retic Teilhard de Chardin. 141 Constance Cumbey stated in A Planned Deception tha t even Bishop Fulton J.

Constance Cumbey reports that, \"Paulist is a Cathol ic publisher whose books tend more towards socialism and outright New Age thinking than they do towards orthodox Christian thinking.\" 143 Gerald and Patricia Mische's Towards A Human World Order, published by Paulist Press in 1977, advocates the New World Order, the New World Religion and a \"whole earth personal identity system\" — right on c ue with World Communism. 144 Paulist Press also publishes for the heretical Cath olic (now Episcopal) priest Matthew Fox who says: \"The good news of the Gospel is that we are deified.\" 145 He believes that we are on the verge of a \"new spi ritual age.\" 146 Fox, while accompanied by three nuns, gave an acup ressure seminar to the United States Council of Bishops. 147 Matthew Fox once told an audience that the Holy Spirit demanded that they adopt wicca (witchcraft), shamanism, and Goddess worship. 148 Fox says: \"For while the Good News is that the Kingdom/Queendom of God h as begun, the bad news is that it has not fully begun and is never fu lly incarnated — much less institutionalized — in any one form or express ion of spirituality. The Holy Spirit will not be locked into any one form of religious faith.\" 149 In a Catholic cathedral in Seattle, Washington, with the blessing of the Archbishop Hunthausen, Matthew Fox, the apostate pr iest, delivered the keynote address to a gay pride organization. 150 Fox has spoken to such 223"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances influential groups as the Roman Catholic parish lea ders and been sponsored by the Archdiocese of Detroit.

Luciferian David Spangler has publically identified Matthew Fox as one of his \"best friends.\" 152 Birds of a feather do flock together! Fox has even obtained public favor from self-confes sed witches! One of his fondest admirers and compatriots at Holy Nam es College in Oakland, California, is Miriam Starhawk, a politica lly active witch and high priestess in a major witch coven. She is also a promoter of the feminist movement which should explain where that m ovement actually comes from. 153 Miriam Starhawk, as a prominent witch, is a propone nt of the New Age religion. She is president of the Covenant of t he Goddess. She says \"Mother Goddess is reawakening and we can begin to recover our primal birthright, the sheer intoxicating joy of being ali ve. We can open our eyes and see that there is nothing to be saved from.. .n o God outside the world to be feared and obeyed.\" 154 It should not be surprising that witches and their comrades in the occult who do not believe in God also do not believe in His judgment. Miriam Starhawk admits that, \"Withcraft is a religi on...Only in this century have witches been able to 'come out of the closet' (because of our 20th century decadence*)...and counter the imagery of evil with truth (Christianity with Satanism*)...To reclaim the word 'witch' is to reclaim our right...to know the lifespirit within as divine .\" 155 Thus, this self- professed witch has linked witchcraft with the New Age — the belief in the god within. Sadly, there are \"New Agers\" who haven' t yet been told that they are in a religion linked with satanists, witch es and the occult. Believe it or not, Miriam Starhawk has been invited to teach in a variety of \"Christian\" churches. In her Circle Netw ork News she revels in her newfound pupils: \"Teaching ritual and the histo ry of the Goddess religion to priests, ministers, nuns and Christian educators was a new experience but deeply rewarding.. .I am very glad t o discover such a strong movement within Christian churches that is sympathe tic to the Pagan Spirit *Author's addition. 224"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"The New Age and willing to learn from the teachings of the Old Religion.\" 156 There! She has told you! — It's a Pagan Spirit! — What else do you want?! Witch Starhawk goes on, \"The longing for expanded c onsciousness has taken many of us on a spiritual 'journey to the East' and to Hindu, Taoist, and Buddhist concepts.. .Eastern religions offer a radically different approach to spirituality than Judeo-Christian tradi tions...Their goal is not to know God, but to be God. In many ways these phil osophies are very close to that of witchcraft-\" 157 Naturally, a witch has no use for the Bible and all of its associated history and archeological facts. Starhawk says, \"We need to create a religion of heretics who refuse to toe any ideologi cal lines or give their allegience to any doctrines of exclusivity.\" 158 Promise Keepers fits the bill here perfectly. When Starhawk speaks of the Mother Goddess, she is speaking the language of the National Council of Churches which long ago demanded that the word \"God\" be changed to \"Our Father and M other.\" The word \"Son,\" which refers to our Lord Jesus Christ, the S on of God should be changed to the word \"child.\" 159 The religion of the National Council of Churches and that of the witch Miriam Starhawk are obviously compatible. Worship of the Mother Goddess is also prevalent in such churches as Unity and Unitarian. How could the Unitarian Church be otherwise with its legacy of being intertwined with The Order of S kull & Bones. Antony Sutton in his book on the American branch of the Il luminati, America's Secret Establishment, reports that, \"The Order [of Skull & Bones] has long-standing and significant links to the relative ly small Unitarian Church. In fact, former President William Taft, who se father co-founded The Order, was President of the Unitarian Associati on in his time. 160 Witch Starhawk confirms the cohesion between the Un itarian Church, the Order of Skull & Bones, and Witchcraft: \"...I p articipated in a Witchcraft service organized by women of San Franci sco's first Unitarian Church...I gave a series of four evening talks at t he same church, culminating in a ritual.. .I was asked to lead a se rvice at a Unitarian Church in Palos Verdes, and to speak to a Unitarian discus sion group in Long Beach — We do have friends out there!\" 161 Benjamin Creme is another New Ager linked with Unit y and Unitarian Church leaders. Constance Cumbey, in her book The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow, identifies Benjamin Creme a nd the Tara Center as promoters of this one-world religion of the New Age. William Schnoebelen in his book, Masonry, Beyon d The Light, 225"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances explains that, \"A key part of the struggle for the souls of men in this nation is taking place on subterranean levels through the dove-tailing of the New Age with Masonry. \"In addition, members of the Masonic Lodge and the New Age are infiltrating Christian churches.

In it are found disciples of the Great Ones who are steadily gather ing momentum and will before long enter upon their designated task.' \" 162 The same letter from the Tara Center quotes Alice B ailey as saying: \"The Masonic movement... will meet the need of thos e who can, and should wield power. It is the custodian of the law; it is the home of the Mysteries and seat of Initiation. It holds in its s ymbolism the ritual of Deity, and the way of salvation is pictorially pres erved in its work. The methods of Deity are demonstrated in its temples, a nd under the All-seeing Eye the work can go forward. It is a far more occul t organization than can be realized, and is intended to be the training school for the coming advanced occutists.\" 163 Schnoebelen should know since he himself was a Freemason and a warlock, that is, a male witch! Freemasonry is a heresy not disimilar to the kind o f heresy which the apostles exposed and their followers fought against throughout the early days of the Manichaens and Chaldeans. It was called — Gnosticism. The true nature of Gnosticism is the full realization b y the Initiate of his divine nature and oneness with the Supreme Being — by what ever name you want to call Him — who is the Universe in all its p hases and in its wholeness and completeness. 164 Gnosticism is back again and deluding millions! The New Age teaches the modern heresy: \"Y our search for these inner teachings is likely to take you to both the h istoric and esoteric literature of mystery schools.

The mai n purpose of this devilish scheme is simply the glorification of man at the expense of the glorification of God. And who would dream up a plan to remove glory from the one true God? The answer, of course, is Sa tan. The New Age has removed the existence of judgment, heaven and hell from all conscious awareness. There is no good or evil, so why would t here need to be a judgement? And why shouldn't the New Agers be confu sed when the Christians are confused as well. The Bible says we will be judged for our works of righteousness. (1 Peter 1:17,2 Peter 1:10) But the Christian of the twentieth century believes no works are necessary t o be saved and the rapture will come before any evil befalls him. So w hat's so different about that and the misguided New Age? Both are misinterpr etations.

She explains the necessit y for this re-creative demonic spirit: \"This unicorn seeks a better world — or a return to a better world — through the purifying, purgative powers of destruction. Its purpose, like that of the Hindu god [Shiva], is to tear down and to renew.\" 254 Author and Freemason William Butler Yeats implied similar forces of destruction in his 1908 play when he said \"...then I saw the unicorns...breaking the world to pieces...And I hea rd the command, 'Destroy, destroy; Destruction is the life giver; D estroy.' \" 255 239"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances This destructive spirit promotes disorder even thou gh it goes by the name of the New World Order.

The old civilization must give way to the new .. .The new Aquarian Age has this power. Nothing can stop it.\" 257 In Alice Bailey's Externalization of the Hierarchy (1957) she explained that beginning in 1934, there was \"the or ganizing of the men and women...so they can set the note of world goodwill for the new world order...Group work of a new order...[with] progess defined by service.. .the work of the Brotherhood.. .the Force s of Light...

Or, these satellites can also project a three-dimension al holographic image which could be seen by no less than one-third of th e population of the earth. 264 Do you suppose this technology will be part of the New Age deception? Cumbey answers, \"Holography will undoubtedly play a role in the prophesied great deception.

This kind of demented thinking is nothing new. As f ar back as 1978, a Washington conference was held called \"Holistic Hea lth: a Public Policy.\" Sharing the speaker's platform among the conspirato rs was the enemy of religion, Buckminister Fuller. 275 This hater of organized religion is a prime mover and shaker in The Hunger Project, a means of taking good-hearted people's money and investing it in the New Age. The New Age Hunger Project admits that \"all of its money goes for a ma ssive public relations campaign designed to promote 'consciousness.'\" 276 Apparently \"cosmic consciousness\" is more of a priority than food to t he New Age leaders. Buckminister Fuller was: 1. founder of World Game Laboratories 2. affiliated with Donald Keys of Planetary Initiative and Planetary Citizens 3. slated to sit on \"World Council of Wise Persons. \" 277 Buckminister Fuller's friend Donald Keys is an open follower of Alice Bailey's teachings. Alice Bailey, as mentioned befo re, founded Lucis Trust, originally incorporated as the Lucifer Publi shing Company. 278 Like the Studebaker Avanti, it was slightly ahead of its time, so they changed it to the less reviling Lucis Trust in 1924. The true sickness of the New World Order folks, how ever, is shown in their plan to totally take over the children of the world and even tamper with their biochemical physiology. In a 1969 NEA Journal article, \"Forecast for the '70s,\" the authors declared that \"ten years hen ce it should be more accurate to term him [the teacher] a 'learning clin ician.' This title is intended to convey the idea that schools are becomi ng 'clinics' whose purpose is to provide the individualized psychosoci al 'treatment' for the student...\" 279 The article also stated that \"educators will assum e a formal responsibility for children when they reach the age of two...[with] mandatory foster homes and 'boarding schools' for c hildren between ages two and three whose home environment was felt to ha ve a malignant *Author's addition. 243"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances influence,\" 280 and that children would \"become the objects of [biochemical] experimentation.\" 281 President Jimmy Carter's National Security Officer, Zbigniew Brzezinski, clearly indi cated that this was to be expected. In his book, Between Two Ages, he stated: \"I foresee the time when we shall have the means and therefore, inevita bly, the temptation to manipulate the behavior and intellectual functionin g of all the people through environment and biochemical manipulation of the brain.\" 282 Brzezinski alluded to \"the possibility of biologica l and chemical tampering with what has until now been considered the immutab le essence of man.\" 283 This professing Marxist, Zbigniew Brzezinski, recen tly endorsed senior Time Correspondent David Aiken's book, Where The Almond Tree Blossoms, which was promoted across the land by \"Ch ristian\" bookstores and was also advocated by Focus of the Family. The book was published by Word, Inc. which was at one time purported to be a Christian publishing company but now publishes books for the Marxist \"Es tablishment.\" Anything recommended by Marxist Brzezinski should b e trashed long before it reaches the bookshelves. It was removed f rom one bookstore by a bookseller who has discernment. To get a good vie w of this sick soul, Brzezinski, founder of the Trilateral Commission, r ead his book Between Two Ages published in 1970. The biochemical tampering idea is nothing new and m ay explain much of the mental anesthesia of the American people. In Planned Parenthood- World Population's journal, Family Planning Perspec tives, we find \"Examples of Proposed Measures to Reduce U.S. Ferti lity, by Universality of Selectivity Impact,\" in which the following agen da is fostered: \"restructure family, encourage increased homosexual ity, educate for family limitation, fertility control agents in the water s upply, encourage women to work, compulsory sterilization of all who have two children...payment to encourage sterilization, abortion, and contraceptio n.\" 284 In 1970, the U.S. Congress passed Title X of the Public Health Servic e Act which established a nationwide system of family planning clinics, and the act was sponsored by the then-Congressman George Bush. 285 It is common procedure for members of the Illuminat i to lie and George Bush is no exception. Bush's sponsorship of the establishment of nationwide family planning clinics follows suit wit h his address registered in the Congressional Record on July 30, 1968 titled \"Population Control and Family Planning.\" Bush stated: \"I have decided to give my vigorous support to measures for population control in both the United States and the world...We must seek to provide nat ions...with birth control 244"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"The New Age devices...We must make sure that these are availabl e on a massive scale.. .call your local Planned Parenthood center. . .\" 286 The National Security Council, instead of working o n defense and security, has been working on destroying the family .

Needed resou rces are provided when the nations of the world implemen t further birth control, infertility programs, and child-killing through abo rtion. Meanwhile, Pat Robertson claims, \"I personally believe that Presid ent Bush is an honorable man and a man of integrity.\" 288 It is not, then, so difficult to understand what is going on today in Amerika, is it? The destruction of America's morali ty has led to a destruction of America's spirituality. The use of \" experiential\" born again experiences without the knowledge and reason to sup port one's faith leads to the falling away of many. Billy Graham's \"born a gain\" experience should be accompanied not with a \"leap\" of faith bu t with a faith built on the dogma of the testament of the Church. This is a \"militant\" church tried in the refiner's fire of persecution. And so it wil l also be in Amerika under a new form of demonized government - one based and built on the beliefs of Communism, Nazism, Occult Freemasonry, and the N ew Age. The Council on Foreign Relations and the New Age The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) is always at the forefront of all political, financial, military and social movem ents in the United States. It would be only customary for the Council to be at the forefront of a world-wide move for a one-world religion. In typica l fashion, then, in the Council's own journal, we find a discussion of the \"spiritual\" world they desire to build. In the July 1948 issue of the CFR' s Foreign Affairs, Sir Harold Butler wrote, \"A New World Takes Shape\" in w hich he declared, \"...Out of the prevailing confusion a new world is taking shape...which may point the way toward the new world order.. .The breath of a new spirit is beginning to reanimate it...That will be the beginning of a real 245"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances United Nations, no longer crippled by a split perso nality, but held together by a common faith.\" 289 This statement should help us understand who is really at the helm of the United Nations — those wh o control the CFR! Less than two years later, on February 17, 1950, a very prominent member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a co -founder of the Communist-front group, the United World Federalists , James P. Warburg, son of former Federal Reserve banker Paul Warburg, told a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee: \"We shall have worl d government, whether we like it or not.. .by consent or by conqu est.\" 290 Only days earlier, on February 9, 1950, the same Fo reign Relations Subcommittee of the Senate introduced Senate Concur rent Resolution 66 which begins, \"...the present Charter of the United Nations should be changed to provide a true world government constitu tion.\" 291 Note that this is the American government that is changing th e United Nations into a true world government! Never let it be said that the United Nations is foisting anything on the United States of America. The government of the United States planned it that way! Alexander Wiley, a Senator and Freemason from Wisconsin, called the resolution \"a consummation devoutly to be wished for,\" and said, \"I understand your proposition is either change the United Nations, or change or crea te, by a separate convention, a world order.\" 292 Senator Glen Taylor of Idaho understood the implications: \"We would have to sacrifice consi derable sovereignty to the world organization to enable them to levy taxes in their own right to support themselves.\" 293 Note that all of this planning was done with considerable forethought. Even to the point of taxi ng the citizens of the U.S. to establish the \"New World Order.\" CFR member Cyrus Vance renewed the advance toward w orld government when on March 30, 1970, he indicated tha t the United States would increase economic aid to developing nations t o further \"progress toward a more equitable and healthy new internation al economic order.\" 294 Bayless Manning was the president of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York in 1974. He was also a \"faculty member\" of the Bohemian Grove. The Bohemian Grove is an occultic group of \" lodge brothers\" who make corporate and political decisions which affect the world. The Bohemian Club was founded in 1872. Clubmates from t he Bohemian Grove include Ambrose Bierce, the author of The Devil's D ictionary and Stephen Bechtel, a director of the Stanford Research Instit ute. 295 CFR member Saul Mendlovitz was at one time the chai rman of the Planetary Citizens Advisory Council.

CFR member Harlan Cleveland of the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies published The Third Try at World Order in 1 977 in which he talked of \"changing Americans' attitudes and institutions [and] of \"complete disarmament (except for international soldiers),\" o f \"fairer distribution of worldly goods through a New International Economic Order,\" and of \"international standards for individual entitlement to food, health, education...\" 300 Alice Bailey's Tibetan Master supposedly told her that disarmament is the last of nine steps to reach the New World Order. \"In the preparatory period for the new world order there wi ll be steady and regulated disarmament. It will not be optional.\" 301 Jimmy Carter is another member of the Council on Fo reign Relations. In 1977, on the day of Jimmy Carter's inauguration for the Presidency, he declared \"I want to assure you that the relations o f the United States with the other countries and peoples of the world will b e guided during our administration by our desire to shape a world order ...\" 302 Although Jimmy Carter is an advocate of the satanic New Worl d Order, Pat Robertson refers to him as a man of goodwill. 303 In the September 24, 1979 issue of U.S. News & Worl d Report, Pat Robertson is quoted as saying: \"...it is absolutely vital that we take control of the United States government away from the Trila teral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations.\" 304 Yet now, as the Council on Foreign Relations gives our country and our families away t o the occultic United Nations and as the CFR continues to promote the Luc iferian New Age, he is silent. In September, 1980, The New International Economic Order (World Goodwill Commentary Number 14) was published emphas izing Alice Bailey's explanation that \"in the destruction of th e old world order and in the chaos of these modern times, the work of the ne w creation is going 247"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances forward; the task of reconstruction, leading to a c omplete reorganization of human living.\" 305 Thomas Ehrenzeller was active with the World Federa lists as well as with Clarence Streit's Association to Unite the Dem ocracies (AUD). Streit was a New York Times (CFR-controlled) correspondent who worked for Times owner and member of the CFR — Arthur Hays Sul zberger. Streit just happened to be a member of the intelligence co mmunity. 306 In 1985, Ehrenzeller wrote Solar Man in which he said: \"A gr eat human civilization is to be built...As solar citizens, we will be part of one mighty race...We could build a world society...and so we will...Ther e is no force that can stop such a movement.. .The New Era is coming, whet her the guardians of the old are ready or not.. .There can be a New W orld Order.. .We will save the world by making of it a bright New Age...T he dawn of the Solar Age will herald the coming of a new Solar Race whic h will last for centuries, millennia even.\" 307 In 1985, the national weekly newspaper, Human Event s, in its August 10th edition, reported CFR member and New Ager Norm an Cousins as saying: \"World government is coming. In fact, it is inevitable. No arguments for or against it can change that fact.\" Norman Cousins as a member of the Council of Foreign Relations and a Ne w Ager promoted World Government. This is the CFR agenda. Since the New Age dissolves Christ, it must therefore be of the Antichrist (1 J ohn 4:3). The promotion of an occultic One-World Government is also of the spirit of Antichrist. Therefore, the Council on Foreign Relations is of t he Antichrist. It is quite logical, then, to understand why on September 11, 1 990 the CFR's George Bush would address Congress and proclaim: \"A new wo rld order can emerge.. .that new world is struggling to be born.\" This \"new world\" re-organization of human living ha s the full support of the World Council of Churches. Lately, the World Council of Churches has been busy sponsoring Antichrist \"Re-Imagining\" Conferences. One such conference held in Minneapolis went like this: Radical lesbian feminist Virginia Mollenkott told t he group: \"I can no longer worship in a theological context that depict s God as an abusive parent and Jesus as the obedient trusting child. Th is violent theology encourages the violence of our streets and our nati ons.\" She also stated, \"The monism I'm talking about assumes that God is s o all-inclusive that She is involved in every cell of those who are thou ghts in Her mind and embodiments of Her image.

This was the reason for the French Revolution. 3 Today many, if not most, of America's politicians are members of occultic secre t societies as are many if not most of those involved in the communications media who form the world's thought, values, lifestlye and fashion. Jam es Billington of the Library of Congress explains in Fire in the Minds o f Men that occupationally, national revolutionaries tend to wo rk in the communications media. He says: \"Whatever their clas s...revolutionaries came together not just in Masonic-type meetings and military conspiracies, but in editorial offices and theaters.\" 4 Instead of the Church being the propagator of value s, role models and symbols for society, Godless journalists, immoral H ollywood stars and corrupt politicians have taken on the leadership an d promotion of customs, morals and \"ethics.\" Our entire culture is formed v ia the propaganda of the TV set, the controlled press, and the controlled pu blic school system. The book 10,000 Famous Freemasons lists numerous member s of Freemasonry who are either owners of broadcast stations and new s outlets or journalists or editors or reporters. Masonic author, Joseph Fort N ewton, agreed that propaganda is important. He indicated to the brothe rhood that, \"...we [Masonry] must have a propaganda of our own...and h ere Masonry may find, and is finding, its greatest opportunity. 5 Later, in the chapter titled, \"The Cornerstone of the Future,\" Newton says,\".. .the Sc ottish Rite has to do with the development of society... into... world order.\" 6 This fits perfectly with the plan of the Illuminati. The historical timing i s right too. The Scottish Rite came out of Berlin in 1786! Its desired goal is \"fo rming one great society over the whole globe.\" 7 Although this may sound nice, it is the same goal as that of Vladimir Lenin. Lenin was also a secret soc iety adherent. He joined the Grand Orient Lodge while a student at the Unive rsity of Kazan. 8 The founder of revolutionary Hegelianism, August Ci eszkowski, argued in the 1840s that the Kingdom was literally about to come \"on earth as it is in heaven.\" An \"organic humanity\" would us her in a new age of \"the holy spirit\" in which all national identities would disappear before the Central Government of Mankind, the Universal Intern ational Tribunal and the Universal Council of the Peoples. 9 This is the real purpose of Ecumenism.

One of the greatest anti-communists of all time was Gary Allen. In the April, 1971 issue of American Opinion magazine Gary Allen explained how the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) performe d the function of energizing and guiding the street revolutionaries i n this country. Allen told how Arthur Waskow, one of the founders of the IPS w as predicting in 1971 that the \"youth revolution\" soon would be taking a surprising new twist, with the \"youth\" turning toward religion. Gary Alle n observed wryly, \"It would be a mistake to rejoice over any 'religious r evival' whose 'spiritual energies' had been brought together by the Institut e for Policy Studies from among its constituency of hippy and New Left elemen ts.\" 10 The Communists always proceed from the age-old theo ry that the most important accomplishment in all forms of warfare is to paralyze your enemy's will to resist before the actual hostilitie s begin. Religious neutralism, the doctrine of peace and love at any c ost and with anybody is a form of religious tranquilizer so potent it has c ompletely incapacitated Communism's most formidable enemy — the Church! John Goodwyn Barmby (Great Britain) first populariz ed the term \"communism\" in England. Barmby associated with Free masonry in France. He proclaimed the religion of Communism. He called for the rejection of Christ's claim to messiahship. 11 Barmby saw the stuggle for Communism in apocalyptical terms: \"In the holy Comm unist Church, the devil will be converted into God...\" 12 The Communists, being deadly enemies of true religi on, have either infiltrated false leadership or sown destructive do ctrine into sacred places. Their favorite place from which to harvest leadersh ip is the Masonic Lodge. For many informed fundamentalist Protestant and Catholic churchgoers it is no secret that their respective c hurches are filled to the brim with members of Freemasonry. The reason, there fore, that the Christian Church no longer speaks with an authorita rian voice against heretics is that the heretics are all preaching fro m the pulpits. Therefore, no man is going to preach against his own brand of her esy, unless he has the courage of St. Athanasius or St. Augustine and of t hese there are few. Masonry stands at the head of all our society. It m akes up our congressmen and our senators. It controls our gover nors. It chooses who will be our state and federal supreme court justices. It picks our presidents and vice-presidents. In the 1800s, it was even responsi ble for organizing the Republican party! 13 It decides on which wars we will fight and it star ts them. Many of our media people are secret society members . The writers and 255"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances journalists of our papers are members. The heads of business and banking are nearly always chosen from among the membership of the Lodge. Our high-ranking military personnel are members. Our ch urch deacons and board members are members of Freemasonry. The leade rs of the various churches, bible societies and pseudo-Christian orga nizations are governed by them. One example is John T. Manson who was born in 1861 and became a trustee of Princeton Theological Seminary and president of the American Bible Society. 14 According to 10,000 Famous Freemasons by William R. Denslow, it's a Masonic World. It has been estimated that over 1 million members o f the Southern Baptist Convention are members of Freemasonry. The Catholic Church has always condemned Masonry but, Stephen Knight in The Brotherhood, says, \"I have discovered that there is a deliberate policy in operation within the English hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church to keep its members in ignorance of the true standing of the Church on the question of Freemasonry (Regarding Canon 2335 which ex-communic ates all Freemasons).. .As well as covering up what I can no w reveal.. .the wall-of- silence policy conceals...a more sinister situation in Rome, where I have evidence that the Vatican itself is infiltrated by Freemasons.\" 15 This infiltration is nothing new for the secret soc iety of Freemasonry. It is how they operate. The book, Spiritual Politic s, has a chapter entitled \"The Invisible Government,\" which discusses the \"En lightened Ones\" who guide the poor masses who could never make it on th eir own. The authors explain that, \"The Enlightened Ones do not usually work openly or give public lectures. Since the earliest times of human history, they have worked quietly behind the scenes — in government, business , science, religion, the arts. It is part of the Divine Plan.\" 16 Since Jesus says He did nothing in secret* can you guess whose \"divine plan\" this might be — a plan which must rem ain in the dark to be successful! The answer is given in Spiritual Politi cs. In the subheading called The Divine Plan, the authors clarify for the reader that this divinity is none other than \"the Great Architect\" who is Fre emasonry's god. 17 Joseph Fort Newton wrote a book copywritten by the Masonic Service Association of the United States and admitted, \"Mor e than an institution, more than a tradition, more than a society, Masonry is one of the forms of *Jesus answered the high priest: \"I have spoken ope nly to the world: I have always taught in the synagogue, and in the tem ple, whither all the Jews resort; and in secret I have spoken nothing.\" (John 18:20) 256"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Conclusion the Divine life upon earth.\" 18 For Freemasonry this divinity is not God's divinity but Man's! Newton explained, \"Man wandered over the earth for ages, searching in all places, high and low, far an d near, before he thought to look within himself for the divinity he sought.. .Here lies the deepest ministry of Masonry — that it makes a young man awa re of the divinity that is within him...\" 19 This is the lie of the New Age as inspired by the Scottish Rite. In 1923, Mason Joseph Fort Newton po eticized: \"The New Age stands as yet Half built against the sky, Open to every threat Of storms that clamor by, Scaffolding veils the walls And dim dust floats and falls As moving to and fro, their tasks The Masons ply.\" The New Age is no accident. Newton stated: \"These t hings shall be — nay, they must be — else America will fail of her p urpose and prophecy.\" 20 America's secret purpose is spiritual. Thus, Newton acknowledged that Freemasonry is a religious institution. He pro udly proclaimed that Masonry is \"that faith which underlies all sects an d over-arches all creeds.\" 21 \"It is a worship.. .leaving each man free to think his own thought and fashion his own system of ultimate truth.\" 22 Newton proudly explains, \"A vast change...is now taking place in the religio us world...and the various sects, so long estranged, are learning to u nite...They are moving toward the Masonic position, and when they arrive M asonry will preside over a scene which she prophecied from the beginnin g.\" 23 Rev. Cahill in Freemasonry and the Anti-Christian Movement remarke d, \"Freemasonry is able to stand by and behold the march of all religi ons as they pass in review.. .All, however, are seen moving along the l ine of natural evolution towards one and the same ethical and spiritual goal .\" 24 What are the results of this \"divine\" masonic hiera rchy's leadership and legislation? 1. The banishment of the Christian religion from al l departments of government, and from all public institutions; and a s a mark of the triumph of this policy, the removal of the Crucifix and all religious emblems from the legislative assemblies, the courts of justice, the public hospitals, the schools and universities. 257"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances 2. The secularization of marriage. 3. The establishment of a State system of so-called ed ucation which, at least in its primary stages, will be obligatory, gr atuitous and conducted by the laity. 4. Complete freedom of worship (for all religions exce pt the true one). 5. Unrestrained liberty of the Press even in the propa gation of irreligious doctrines and of principles subversive of morality; similar freedom for the stage, the cinema, and for all manner of public activities, even when most injurious to the public interest, such as the operation of the betting and gambling a gencies. 6. The elimination of all distinction between the sexe s in education and in all departments of public life, and the prom otion or encouragement of radical feminism. 25 Thus, Rev. Cahill concluded, \"It [Freemasonry] bear s, unmistakably, the brand of Anti-Christ. To an extraordinary exten t it fulfils the substance of that tradition which has been handed down from g eneration to generation. 'It is opposed to every existing worshi p true and false.' It is opposed to Christianity, Mohammedanism, Judaism (To rah), to the religions of Buddha and Confucius and to every othe r perversion of religious thought that has hitherto existed. It ins ists on building temples and raising altars of its own. It has its own speci al ritual and ceremonies, its priesthood, and its secret worship. It has set up its new-fangled paganism as a substitute for the religion of the tr ue God. It wallows in blasphemy and in crimes of bloodshed and injustice. \"It has despoiled and profaned churches. It has rob bed and cast out the ministers of God. It has torn the children from the fold of Christ. It has delivered individuals to torture and death, and plu nged nations into sanguinary wars. It has done these things, and many things more with a hypocritical pretence to virtue and love of humanit y that could scarcely be surpassed by the father of lies, from which it spri ngs. No such embodiment of evil has ever existed in this world, or is ever likely to exist. Heresies have existed that have imperiled human souls and da maged the cause of God. Men have bound themselves together for the pro motion of unjust and evil ends. But we search in vain for anything that strikes so deliberately and persistently at everything that the uncontamina ted human soul holds sacred. Unless Anti-Christ be Satan incarnate, as s ome indeed have held, then Freemasonry is Anti-Christ.\" 26 New Age leader and occultist Alice Bailey channeled Djwhal Khul who confirmed that, \"The objective of the new socia l order, of the new 258"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Conclusion politics, the new religion is...to bring in the Kin gdom...Of antichrist.\" 27 \"Whose coming is according to the working of Satan, in all power, and signs, and lying wonders, And in all seduction of i niquity to them that perish; because they receive not the love of the tr uth, that they might be saved.\" (2 Thessalonians 2:9,10) Perhaps now it is understandable why the United Nat ions' New Group of World Servers has a plan to 1) \"Recognize and ch ange those aspects of religion and government which delay the full manife station of planetary unity...\" 2) \"Connect world governments with a unit y of purpose\" and 3) \"Form the vanguard for the reappearance of the Chri st and Great Disciples (the Masters of Wisdom).\" 28 The New Age and the New Church persuades that the new will overcome the old by the gentle process of ecumenical unity. To meet at the watering hole of u nity-in-diversity is the serpentine siren song of the New Age. That oasis wh ich looks so real is nothing but a poisonous deception. This is simply t he re-engineering (re- inventing*) of a culture accomplished with the \"div ine plan\" of Lucifer/Satan in mind. The gnostics of Freemasonry offer \"Brotherhood\" and \"Liberty\" with the allurement that man's freedom is the ultimate q uest. This liberty, however, is the liberty that the apostle Peter spok e of in 1 Peter 2: 16: \"...not as making liberty a cloak for malice.\" The charmer promotes freedom without responsibility. Masonic author Newt on claims: \"...it is the Fate of man to be Free.. .uniting his will with the Will of the Master of the World!\" 29 Joseph Fort Newton explained in The Men's House, th at Albert Pike, the greatest sovereign pontiff of Freemasonry, \"set himself to study the origin of the order...At last he found, to his amaz ement and joy, that Masonry is the Ancient Greater Mysteries in disguis e...\" 30 Pike reported, \"It has the symbols and doctrines of the old Aryan faith.\" 31 The Arian doctrine was condemned in the 4th century and Arms and his followers were banished for heresy. Heresy has now ascended t o the level of a world religion. It is therefore understandable why the re ligion of the state and the religion of the churches can be one — because they are both of the world as is their author — the prince of darkness — the \" Master of the World.\" Yet the charmed and sophisticated man of the world does not hear the words of Jesus Christ who says in John 14:30: \"For the prince of this world cometh, and in me he hath not anythng.\" And in John 16:7-11: \"the prince *Author's addition. 259"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Unholy Alliances of this world is already judged.\" \"And every spirit that dissolveth Jesus, is not of God: and this is Antichrist...\" (1 John 4:3- 5) Jesus prayed: \"I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou hast given me: because they are thine.\" ( John 17:9) So dear Christian, \"If the world hate you, know ye, that it hath hated me before you.
