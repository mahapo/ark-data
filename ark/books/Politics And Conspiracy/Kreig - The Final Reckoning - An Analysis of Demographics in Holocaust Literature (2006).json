Harold Kreig "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 6 Foreword This analysis of certain aspects of the German concentration camp system will be of no comfor t to either extreme of the controversy surrounding the actual purpose of the camps and the final numbers of those who perished in them. One well-entrenched and influential entity claims that the sole purpose of the system was to exterminate Europe’s Jewish population and that it achieved its goal in that between six and seven million Jews were systematically put to death between 1934 and 1945. An opposing entity claims that the camps were basically prisons, not murder mills, and that the extermination of Jews was neither massive nor state policy. The basic problem here is that until the end of the Soviet regime, nearly all the complete records of the camp system seized by the Red Army at the system’s headquarters in Oranienburg Camp outside of Berlin in 1945 were kept locked away by the Russians and not made available to anyone. Since it was the standard practice of the Soviets to harass the West German government in any way possible, the sequestering of such files that might prove enormous totals of the persecuted dead could well indicate that these files in all probability proved the opposite. In 1990, with the advent of Glasnost , rolls of microfilm containing all the camp records were released by Russian archivists on a very limited basis. One se t of these films went to the International Red Cross central tracing agency at Arolsen, Germany. Several other complete sets found their way into the hands of other special interest groups. These recently revealed figures stand at strong variance with the numbers proposed since the war. Earlier estimates of several millions dead at Auschwitz, all Jews, have now been reduced to about one million. There is, obviously, a tremendous difference between the two figures and until recently, the larger one has been impossible to prove or disprove. In all probability, the actual death toll at Auschwitz will never be known. There is no question that a number died unrecorded but given the choice between official period figures and anecdotal history, the offi cial statistics of the period are more realistic. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 7 There is another means by which an equitable balance can be reached. The official files with their figures can easily be compared with the records of the German Finance Ministry that oversees the implementation of the so-called Wiedergutmachung or restitution program. This was a po st-war program initiated by the “Supplementary Federal Law for the Compensation of the victims of National Socialist Persecution” on October 1, 1953 and the subsequent final law of the same name promulgated on September 14, 1965. This law guarantees financial compensation for, among other categories, “survivors of the deceased victims (of National Socialism.)” and greatly expanded the numbers of categories and compensation payments. It should be noted that of 4,406,072 claims submitted under this legislation between October 1, 1953 and December 31, 1986, 4,404,755 or 99.9 percent had been se ttled by January 1, 1987. By 1988, the payments were projected to be a total of 102,653 billion German Marks with 3 billion going to the State of Israel. It is not difficult for an objective observer to realize that this program supplies a tremendous incentive for the co mmission of fraud on a gigantic scale. A simple solution to the divergence of numbers would be found in comparing the known figures with the figures supplied in millions of affidavits now on file in the German Finance ministry. As the contemporary wartime German files show a total number of 400,000 deaths in all camps of all inmates, an official comparison between these files might prove to be of considerable financial benefit to the German gover nment and its taxpayers.

The town of Auschwitz in Silesia was chosen because of its proximity to the coal fields and its location at the junction of three rivers. Also, the area was consid ered out of the range of Allied bombers who were now beginning their attacks on German industry in the Ruhr and on random civilian targets. At the town of Auschwitz wa s a former Polish artillery barracks housing about 6,500 Polish prisoners of war. This camp was subsequently expanded into a work camp for political prisoners. This was called Auschwitz I. Also in 1941, a second camp was begun approximately two miles northwest of the main camp. It was called Birkenau or Auschwitz II and was initially a prisoner of war camp. It was opened in April 1942. Auschwitz III, or Monowitz, was instituted in November 1941 and was located three miles east of Auschwitz, close to the IG Farben plant. There were a number of satellite work camps, basically in a 25 mile radius of the main camp. Most of these served the local coal mines or the coke furnaces. In the beginning, the camps we re full of Polish prisoners of war and after June 1941, filled up with Soviet prisoners of war. Later, political prisoners, including Comm unists, joined the population along with religious dissenters, homosex uals, professional criminals, Jews, Gypsies, and a number of British prisoners of war. The inmates were intended to serve as contract labor to the many German firms that set up shop in the neighborhood. The SS was paid so much per head per diem, kept what it was able to and grudgingly spent as little as possible on the maintenance of the prisoners. Exceptions were made for skilled labor who received better quarters and rations than the unskilled and marginally productive. The introduction of Russians into the population brought the dread typhus with them and from time to time, terrible epidemics swept the camp, filling the hospital s with dead and dying. Typhus, which is a highly infectious disease, ( Rickettsia prowazekii ) exists only in humans and their body lice. The death rate was very high from this disease as antibiotics now used in its control were not available at the time. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 10 It became necessary for all incoming prisoners to have their heads shaved and be disinfected prior to entering the camp. The disinfection consisted of showering with medicated soap. All clothing from new prisoners was confiscated and deloused in rooms designed for this purpose. Zyklon B, a commercial disinfectant, was used for this. New inmates were issued clean prison clothing and all of their possessions were put into storage and later shipped to Germany as raw material. Nearly all the prisoners entering Auschwitz were entered in the books and issued a number. The entries listed the prisoners by name, date of birth and number. It was the standard practice to keep a registry of all prisoners who died in this camp by date of death, name, number and cause of death. The Russian files contain the complete mortality lists for Auschwitz. Based on these figures, from the opening of the camp in 1941 until very late in 1944 (the camp finally closed in the first month of 1945) the total of all inmate dead was 111,010 . Of this figure, 93%, or 103,447 , died of typhus alone. The remaining 7,563 died of natural causes, suicide or were executed for a number of reasons such as murder of another inmate, theft of food and the like. Of the 111,010 dead, 54 %, or 60,421, were Jews and are so listed in the heavily documented official death rolls. In the years intervening since the end of the Second World War, there has built up a legend about the planned murder by the Germans of European Jewry. A program of euthanasia, it is said, was later developed into a wide-spread program of mass gassings of Jews in various of the German prisons called Concentration Camps. The motivator behind these mass killings was, the legend states, Adolf Hitler whose personal hatred of Jews dr ove him to order his dread Gestapo and SS to round up and kill every Jew they could lay their hands on. Initially, the camp at Dachau, outside of Munich, was stated to be the center of the murder machine but as it became evident after the end of the war that this camp did not gas large numbers of Jews or anyone else, the killing cent er was arbitrarily moved to the east, to the town of Auschwitz located on several rivers in Upper Silesia."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 11 Here, it is said, a vast death camp was built to house tens of thousands of Jews awaiting thei r turn in the enormous gas chambers, and a second camp, Auschwitz II or Birkenau was also built for the sole purpose of slaughtering the Jews who made up almost the entire population of this murder central. Jewish victims, it has been written, poured into Auschwitz from all over conquered Europe. They arrived, jammed into cattle cars, were dragged out of their transport, lined up and immediately forced into the huge gas chambers. Later, after they were dead, their stiffened corpses were dragged out by other camp inmates and shoved into equally gigantic crematoria and burned to ashes. In recent years, bits and pieces of evidence that would tend to bring some of this into question has resulted in a further shift to the east. Supporters of the mass murder theories, aware of the existence of official documentation disproving their exorbitant claims, now postulate that the SS Einsatzgruppen or Combat Units, composed of Sicherheitsdienst (SD) and German police units, who were operating behind the German front lines in Russia, were the true murders of millions of Jews. In the savage anti-Partisan wars, the Einsatzgruppen were stated to have slaughtered millions of Communist functionaries, Russian, and some Polish, Jews. Opposing an enormous body of literature and media productions, a number of dissatisfied historians began to question the validity of the allegations of an immense German murder plot aimed primarily at Jews but also expanded to include Gypsies. Any attempts to bring these allegations into question were met immediately by loud outcries from their proponents and needless to say, no major publishing house anywhere in the world would dare to publish even the most moderate and meticulously researched revisionist work. The enormous death toll of six million dead Jews, it is firmly said by proponents of the murder machine theory, is immutable; these figures are well and permanently established in history and questioning them is the work of anti-Semites, neo-Nazis and professional, unbalanced hate-mongers. It is the actual figures, however, upon which the legend of the Holocaust stands or falls. Are there such figures? Are they reliable? Surely in the enormous official German records, captured"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 12 by both the Soviets and Americans, there have to be specific confirmations of the awful death tolls. In fact such records do exist; some in Moscow and some in Washington, DC, but these original documents are generally not available to what Holocaust support ers state are prev aricators, liars and anti-Semites. They can be found today in official state archives, some difficult to find because they have been misfiled and others because pressure groups who fear their publication have pressured the archives to keep them hidden. In this study, we have explored these forbidden or obscured documents, collated them and are presenting the results in an effort to achieve some balance for a subject that heretofore has been the private playground of individuals and organizations who have a vested financial and political motive in preventing any erosion of what they see is their own territory. As huge sums of money have resulted from the maintenance and careful nurturing of what has proven to be an extraordinarily successful cash cow, the desperat ion of its creators can easily be understood. Truth, however, is mighty and shall prevail. The Holocauster’s Agenda To open this investigation, consider the following article produced by the pro-Holocaust peopl e calling themselves the “Nizkor Project” This article represents the official Jewish view of the Auschwitz work complex as a death camp solely intended for the slaughter of European Jews: “How many people died at Auschwitz? “Most Americans have been instructed in the \"irrefutable fact\" that homicidal gassings ha d taken place at Auschwitz. The number of those so executed - also declared irrefutable - was 4.1 million."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 13 Then came the Leuchter Report in 1988. This was followed by a \"re-evaluation\" of the total deaths at Auschwitz (down to 1.1 million). Previous to 1992, anyone w ho publicly doubted the 4.1 million \"gassing\" deaths at Auschw itz was labeled an anti-Semite, neo-nazi skinhead (at the very least). Quietly, because of revisionist findings, the official figure was lo wered to 1.1 million. No mention of that missing 3 million. It is correct to note that the Polish Communist government did claim that four million people we re exterminated at Auschwitz, historians ( Feig, Reitlinger, Hilberg, et al.) have never supported that figure. Consider the estimates provided by Buszko at the end of his article on Auschwitz, which appe ared in the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust: • Of the 405,000 registered pr isoners, 65,000 survived • Of the 16,000 Soviet POW's, 96 survived • Various estimates suggest 1.6 million were murdered Buszko's article, and the above estimates, appeared in the 1990 edition of the Encyclopedia, which clearly puts the lie to Foner's comment that \"anyone who publicly doubted the 4.1 million .. \" figure \"previous to 1992...\" was \"...labeled an anti-Semite...\". Buszko is not only a Jewish historian, but Polish as well. Leon Poliakov, the author of the well-documented \"Harvest of Hate,\" which was, we note, first published in 1956 , provides the following information, which clearly demonstrates that Foner's contention, cited above, is an outright lie: After some thirty months of intense activity, the Auschwitz balance sheet showed close to tw o million immediate exterminations (this figure can never be fixed exactly), (8) to which one must add the deaths of some 300,000 registered prisoners - Jews for the most part, but not entirely - for whom the gas chamber was only one of any number of ways by whic h they might have perished. ( Poliakov, 202 )"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 14 In his affidavits, Hoess spoke of two and a half million, 'a figure set officially,' he wrote, under the signature of [Eichmann], in a report to Himmler. This figure has been accepted by several authors, and it appears in the verdict at the trial of the major war criminals. However, there is no reason for accepting without question the statistics attributed to Eichmann, which may err on either side. Adding the number of victims to those deported from different countries gives a lower figure, although we have little data, for example, on the number of Polish Jews sent to Auschwitz. An approximate figure in the neighborho od of two million seems closer to the truth.\" ( Ibid. ) Feig notes that: Hoess testified that the Tesc h directors could not help but know of the use for their product because they sold him enough to annihilate two million people.' Feig's book was published in 1981 According to Snyder, Adolf Eichmann reported to Himmler, in 1944, that four million had been killed in the camps, and another million had been shot or killed by mobile units. ( Encyclopedia of the Third Reich. 1989 ) Eichmann's report, which referenced all the camps (most of which were in Nazi-occupied Poland), may have been the source of the Polish Communist government's figures. (Snyder is a Professor of History at the City College and the City University of New York.) During the war crimes trials, Ho ess was asked if it was true that he had no exact numbers because he had been forbidden to compile them, and he agreed. He also agreed that Adolf Eichmann had told him that that more than two million people had been exterminated there. ( von Lang, 120 ) The Institut für Zeitgeschichte , Munich, provided the following capsulated paragraph about Auschwitz in a March, 1992, letter of inquiry. The extermination camp in Birkenau, established in the second half of 1941, was joined to the concentration camp Auschwitz, existing since May 1940. From January 1942 on in five"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 15 gas chambers and from the end of June 1943 in four additional large gassing-rooms gassings with Zyklon B have been undertaken. Up until November 1944 more than one million Jews and at least 4000 gypsies have been murdered by gas. (IFZ) While it is admittedly difficult to compile exact figures , (emphasis added) since the Nazis did not maintain registration records for those who were to be exterminated immediately upon arrival at Auschwitz, it seems accura te to assert that the number of Jews killed fell somewhere between one and one-point-six million. According to figures provided by the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, the overall number of victims of Auschwitz in the years 1940-1945 is estimated at between 1,100,000 and 1,500,000 people. The majority of them, and a bove all the mass transports of Jews who arrived beginning in 1942, died in the gas chambers. (Waclaw Dlugoborski and Franciszek Piper, Eds. Auschwitz 1940- 1945. Central Issues in the History of the Camp . The Auschwitz- Birkenau State Museum, 2000, 5 vols., 1799 pp., ISBN 83-85047-87- 5) Jews were not the only victim s of this Nazi German killing machine - historians estimate that among the people sent to Auschwitz there were at least 1,100,000 Jews from all the countries of occupied Europe, over 140,000 Poles (mostly political prisoners), approximately 20,000 Gypsies from several European countries, over 10,000 Soviet prisoners of war , and over 10,000 prisoners of other nationalities. (Emphasis added.) Two German firms, Tesch/Stabenow and Degesch, produced Cyclone B gas after they acquired the patent from Farben. Tesch supplied two tons a month, and Degesch three quarters of a ton. The firms that produced the gas already had extensive experience in fumigation.” "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 16 Commentary on the agenda This overview is entirely typical of the “death camp” argument. It is not based on official figures obtained from various archives but solely upon the personal opinions of individuals who are obviously writing to an idea. Such phrases as “as everyone knows,” “absolutely established”, “irrefutable facts” and “thoroughly refuted” are the easily-recognized hallmarks of the propagandist, not the historian. In point of fact, writers attempting to confirm the allegations of astronomical death tolls for European Jews are not writing from any kind of an objective historical point of view but from thoroughly skewed and propagandistic one. Truth is the first casualty of the propagandist. The argument is made that since it is “clearly evident” that six million European Jews were slaughtered by the Nazis under Hitler, the fact that nowhere in t he through and extensive files of the Third Reich can be found any specific reference to such acts, the answer to this absence is also clearly evident; there are special and secret lists made of Jews who were not entered onto the rolls of the camps but who were immediately executed. However, if there are no existing Third Reich documents proving the mass murders, neither ar e there any of the secret lists to be found. The “secret list” theory is one of desperation, not a clever invention. Another thesis put forward is that the shipments of Jews (according to the legends, only Jews were shipped to Auschwitz) from various countries encompassed by the Third Reich, contained large numbers of victims, sometimes numbering over two thousand. Of these transportees, a number were entered on the camp rolls and the rest, unrecorded, were immedi ately gassed in non-existent gas chambers. It should be noted that the German Reichsbahn or State Railroads shipped prisoners in railroad cars that contained 21 bunks. As a typical example, a n RSHA transport from Pithiviers,France, Number 14 , to Auschwitz arriving on August 3, 1942 , contained 22 men and 542 women. The men received camp numbers of 56411"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 17 through 56432 . The train consisted of the engine and tender, a baggage car, two guard cars and 17 transport cars. A grossly inflated postwar account published in “Auschwitz Chronicle ”, by Danuta Czech, Henry Holt, 1990 p. 211 claimed that 1,034 prisoners arrived at Auschwitz of whom 470 were not registered and were immediately gassed. If the Czech account is correct, how were the additional 470 inmates shipped? Strapped to the car roofs? Compacted into the engine tender? Or most likely in t he fertile imagination of the author. When the Glücks 1 files emerged in Moscow, the archivists at the Central Archives stated that Jewish groups were well aware of these documents and had repeatedly insisted that the Russians not release them to “outsiders” who were “not able to properly understand them.” 2 What obviously was meant is that these extensive, and complete, files clearly did not suppo rt the murder of six millions of European Jews and their release would merely complicate the fundraising efforts of the propone nts of the planned extermination theories. As an historical footnote to this commentary, the following officially recorded conversation of Hitl er’s is set forth. The first part of it has been widely quoted in a number of books but the second part, for obvious reasons, has not. On Saturday, October 25, 1941, Hitler received Count Ciano, Italian Foreign Minister at his East Prussian military headquarters for a conference. Present were a number of senior government officials. Following the conference, Hitler held a small, private dinner for several of these personages. One of them was Heinrich Himmler, Chief of the SS and the other was ( SS-Obergruppenführer ) Reinhard Heydrich, head of the Main State Security Office ( Reichssicherheitshauptamt-RSHA ) which controlled the Gestapo and the SD. During the course of the dinner, Hitler said: “From the rostrum of the Reichstag I prophesized to Jewry that, in the event of war’s proving inevitable, the Jew   1 SS-Gruppenführer Richard Glücks was head of the Concentration Camp system. He vanished after the war an d was reported to be working for Western intelligence as late as 1955. 2 Correspondence with the U.S. Ho locaust Museum, Washngton DC of January 15, 1992."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 18 would disappear from Europe. That race of criminals has on its conscience the two million dead of the First World War, and now already hundreds of thousands more.” At this point, historians generally comment on Hitler’s obvious intention to slaughter all the Jews he could lay his hands on. The generally unreported balance of the conversation conveys a rather different meaning. “Let nobody tell me that all the same we can’t park them in the marshy parts of Russia! Who’s worrying about our troops? It’s not a bad idea, by the way, that public rumor attributes to us a plan to exterminate the Jews. Terror is a salutary thing .” 3 The question of the number of persons who died in Auschwitz has been addressed in a publication entitled Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp . 4 A chapter by Franciszek Piper entitled “The Number of Victims” addresse s the issues discussed here and sections of it deserve to be quoted and enlarged upon. “In erasing traces of the cr imes perpetrated in Auschwitz- Birkenau, the Nazis destroyed docu ments that could serve as the basis for determining how many people died there. When the Soviet soldiers liberated the camp in January 1945, they found documents that confirmed only 100,000 deaths. Yet surviving prisoners maintained that millions ha d perished at Auschwitz. Faced with this disparity, officials of the Soviet Extraordinary State Commission, the organization en trusted with investigating the crimes committed at Auschwitz, conducted an in-depth study. Based on witness testimonies regarding the capacity of the camp and the length of time that its machiner y for mass murder was operative , (emphasis added) the commission concluded that no fewer than four million (emphasis added) persons were put to death at the camp...Four million...is the number reco rded in Polish literature, as well as in publications of other countries.” In The Final Solution , one of the first books to deal with the Holocaust, published in 1953, the figure of four million was radically   3 “ Hitler’s Secret Conversations , 1941-1945,” New York, 1953, p 72, Protocol 52. 4 “ Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp ,” ed. Yisrael Gu tman and Michael Berenbaum, 1994, Indiana University Press. pps 61 et seq. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 19 reevaluated. English art historian Gerald Reitlinger estimated the number of victims at Auschwitz to be roughly 800,000 to 900,000 , (emphasis added) based on an analysis of the losses of Jews reported by specific countries... The destruction by the Nazis of most Auschwitz records is the most important cause of divergent estimates...researchers had to rely on discrepant and imprecise data from testimonies and depositions of witnesses, former prisoners and Nazi functionaries and on court decisions and fragmentary and incomplete records of camp registries, archives, (sic) and other institutions. (Emphasis added).” The question of the destructi on of Auschwitz records has been raised over the years to support the claims that large numbers of people died in the camp but were not recorded. If the SS camp administration did destroy or remove official records from Auschwitz before the complex was overrun by the Soviets in early 1945, they did not and could not touch the records that had been sent to the headquarters of the camp system ou tside of Berlin, or any other copies sent to different agencies. According to the author of the article, the Soviets did find records indicating 100,000 deaths. Reliance on anything originating from Stalin’s agents is totally unrealistic. The Soviets had no problem continuously rewriting their own history and obviously w ould have had no problem rewriting the history of other nations. The concurrence of the Poles in Soviet findings has no validity whatsoever. Poland was under complete control of the Soviets at the time of their reports and any official commission would do precisely as it was told by its masters. It was only after the implosion of the Soviet Empire that their state archives became available to outside researchers, at least on a limited basis. As has been noted before, it was the standard policy of the Soviet government to denigrate and attack the government of West Germany, not support it. The microfilms released by the Russian archives in the early 1990s were copies of documents found at the SS concentration camp headquarters located at Oranienburg in 1945 and had these supported the theory of extensive extermination programs, they certainly would have been released years before. There is another argument us ed to explain the lack of documentation supporting the thesis of a million or more dead at"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 20 Auschwitz. This argument claims that endless transports of Jews were delivered to the camp, not recorded anywhere and immediately executed. This, it is claimed, expl ains why there is such a disparity between official German figures and those proposed by others. This argument has some fleeting validity but the question arises that if these transports were unrecorded in German records, how could anyone use them as references other than by supposition and speculation? It is very difficult to have one’s cake and eat it too. The question of transport also needs to be addressed. When the German Reichsbahn scheduled rail transportation to Auschwitz, it was listed officially as special trains ( Sonderzug ) which indicated that the transports were privately contracted...in this case by the SS. If these transports were of an offi cial, State nature, they would be listed as regular traffic, paid for by the government. While in the beginning of the forced Jewish emigration prior to the war, the Jewish community in Germany and overseas was compelled to pay for the emigration out of their own pockets, such accommodations were not operational during the war except in rare cases. It should also be noted that transport from Auschwitz taking manufactured products to various points in Europe were also listed as Special Trains. Auschwitz was part of the SS economic empire and as such, was run by the SS and not the German government. The Armed SS ( Waffen-SS ) was not an official part of the Wehrmacht and its operating expenses, as were the op erating expenses for the entire SS, had to be paid for by the SS itself. This in itself would cast considerable doubt on the thesis that a vast extermination program had been ordered by Hitler officially as State policy. When the SS ran out of operating capital, the transports stopped running. The use of prisoner labor was certainly addressed in the numerous trials held after the war. Another thesis often express ed is that the victims at Auschwitz were nearly all Jewish. Reports from the camp break down the exact number of inmates by groups, to include Jews. At Auschwitz, by far the largest group were those held in protective custody or as political prisoners. With former Soviet archival material now available, a greater balance should be much easier to obtain. It was only their stubborn"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 21 refusal to release these records that allowed inflated figures, supported only with anecdotal and unsupported material, to flourish and, like ivy, expand and cover every aspect of the building beneath. This archival material has, in fact, been available on microfilm since 1989 but is rarely discussed. An article in the New York ‘Times’ of March 3, 1991 quotes the Soviet sources with considerable accuracy. Forty-six camps are covered with a total death toll of more than 400,000 . Auschwitz records contain approximately 70,000 death certificates and in addition the death totals of 130,000 among the forced laborers in all camps and 200,000 additional names of various classes of prisoners in all camps to include Buchenwald, Sachsenhausen and Gross Rosen. When queried about this article and the numbers reflected in it, Red Cross officials in Washington, DC agreed that they were indeed the figures contained in the microfilms they had received from Soviet sources but that “special se cret lists” existed that boosted the death toll far higher. Further questioning elicited that no one had seen these “secret lists” but that they must certainly exist and that quoting from the official records was “misleading” and should not be done. In contradiction to these assertions, the German Red Cross Search Service, located at Arolsen in Germany, has published official figures of the known dead in the various concentration camps. These figures are based on clearly identified individuals and are not connected with the former Soviet archival material. In December of 1983, the total and revised figures of the dead in Auschwitz was 53,633 . The Arolsen facility no longer pub lishes such list s because of strong objections by the Jewish community. The reasons for these successful protests should be clearly evident. The records of the concentration camp system discovered by the Soviets at the system headqua rters outside of Berlin in 1945 are complete. From a chronological point of view, there are no gaps.

These consisted of radio reports sent in to Oranienburg on a monthly basis. From early 1942 through February of 1943, British intelligence was monitoring these reports and in their official postwar history of the British intelligence system, stated specifically that: “The returns from Auschwitz, the largest of the camps with 20,000 prisoners, mentioned illness as the main cause of death, but included references to shootings and hangings. There were no references in the decrypts to gassing.” (emphasis added) 6 Given inaccurate demographics about the post-war Jewish population, there is still a considerable gap in the number of Jews, mostly Polish Jews, who were living in Poland in 1939 and unaccounted for in 1945. The assumption was made, and is still being made, that these differences were clearly explained by the extermination theory. The former Soviet Union maintained a rigid control over its files until its collapse, and it has only been since this point in time that a much clearer picture of events has become evident. In 1995, Russian author Arkady Vaksberg, a Jewish writer, attorney, and investigative journalist, published a book entitled Stalin Against The Jews , the basic theme of which is the persecution of Soviet Jews by Stalin after he had used them against his enemies. Vaksberg goes into some detail about the Polish Jews who, in September of 1939, fled the German advance into Poland and went into the Soviet Union. Vaksberg states that these Polish Jews were seized by Stalin’s agencies and put into prison camps.   5 Amery, vol.5, 252, 253, 601; vol. 6, 24-25 6 “ British Intelligence in the Second World War ,” Hinsley et al, London, 1980, vol. 11, p 673.

Part of this ignorance was due to the fact that Franklin Roosevelt had not wanted Truman as his Vice President in 1944, much preferring the ultra-liberal Henry Wallace who was far more acceptable to Soviet leader Josef Stalin. Wallace's pro-Soviet views were more in harmony with Roosevelt's courtship of the Soviet dictator. It was certainly known in Russia that Ro osevelt's health was rapidly failing and a pro-Soviet successor would have been a man with whom Stalin would prefer to deal. The Democratic Party officials also recognized this situation and basically forced Roosevelt to choose another running mate. Senator Harry Truman of Missou ri was eventually decided upon, dashing the hopes of a fulsome and entirely permissive postwar cooperation by the United States with Soviet Russia for Wallace, Roosevelt and Stalin. Roosevelt was a vindictive and petty man and he deliberately kept Truman, an individual with no knowledge of military intelligence, in complete ignorance of such matters, even denying him any information about the dev elopment of the atomic bomb. After Roosevelt's sudden, but not unexpected, death in 1945, Truman ascended to his high office with almost no knowledge of the structure or the aims of either military intelligence or the Office of Special Services, the OSS, a clandestine intelligence organization set up by William Donovan, a New York lawyer friend of Roosevelt. When Truman discovered what was obvious to most insiders, namely that the OSS was filled with active Communists, put there, it should be added, at Roosev elt's specific request so as to be better able to work with their Soviet opposite numbers, he ordered the OSS to be disbanded on September 20,1945, five months after he assumed office.

The National Security Act was passed on July 26, 1947 and subsequent to this, the National Security Council was instituted. Their stated aim was to coordinate all foreign, domestic and military policies insofar as they related to national security. The Central Intelligence Agency, formed under the National Security Act, superseded a Central In telligence Group (CIG), formed by Truman in January of 1946 and initially headed by Admiral Sidney W. Souers, a former deputy chief of Naval Intelligence. In 1948, the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, which had been simmering since the death of Roosevelt and the end of the Second World War, began in earnest. Stalin, testing the military and political will of his former ally, instituted a tight, military blockade of the f our-power controlled German capital of Berlin. Truman met this challenge with a massive airlift that kept the city supplied by air and Sta lin eventually gave up and stopped the blockade. Stalin had serious problems with Tito, ruler of the Soviet satellite state of Yugoslavia and there was a seizure of power by the Communists in the former Republic of Czechoslovakia. All of this increased international tension caused the United States, which had almost no realistic intelligence from behind Stalin's Iron Curtain, to begin to turn for advice and assistance more and more to the U.S. and Stalin's former enemies, the Germans. It is axiomatic that one seeks allies when one hates, not when one loves. In 1946, the former head of the German military intelligence section on the Soviet military sy stem, General Reinhard Gehlen, began to work for the U.S. Army, and in 1948 his group was taken over by the CIA and run out of Pu llach, a suburb of Munich, by Colonel James Critchfield. Gehlen, whose wartime work on Russian military, as opposed to political, activities was strictly limited to order of battle matters, was more often wrong than right in his analysis of the strengths and operational goals of the Soviet Army and had eventually been fired from his position by Hitler for gross incompetence."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 26 The American authorities were not as quick to judge the arrogant former General and found him very useful in what is called empire building. By 1948, Gehlen's reports, wi th no alterations whatsoever, were being issued to the President as having come directly from the brilliant specialists of the CIA. In early 1948, at the urgent request of his American military controllers, Gehlen issued a grav e report stating that 175 Soviet armored divisions were poised to strike into Germany. This report was entirely fictional, a fact that was known to U.S. military intelligence at the time it was issued. The Gehlen Report was, however, tailored to the needs of several powerful groups within the American government, the military an d industrial complex targeted by President Eisenhower as t he fomenter of the Cold War. It so alarmed Congress and the President at the time of its unofficial but entirely deliberate rele ase in official Washington, that the ongoing reduction in U.S. militar y forces was immediately halted and the business community that had reaped such enormous profits during the course of the Second World War saw the opportunity of recovering the economic ground they had lost when that war ended in 1945. As a result of the rise of bellicosity in the West, several programs were officially institut ed to combat what was seen as the imminent threat of Soviet military action. These were under the aegis of NSC 20, a series of directives issued to various agencies concerning the use of former enemies in the coming fight against the Soviet Union. 8 The first series, under the control of the U.S. Army were, respectively, Operations Apple Pie , (a joint US-British action), Birchwood , Pajamas and Projects Credulity and Dwindle . 9   8 The complete text of NSC20/1 may be found in Containment: Documents on American Policy and Strategy 1945-1950, Thomas Etzold & John Lewis Gaddis, New York, 1978. 9 The files on these operations can be found in the U.S. National Archives under P&O File TS, Sections I, II & III, 1948-1948 Records of the Army"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 27 The U.S. Department of State, not to be outdone, instituted Operation Bloodstone, a program tha t, like the U.S. Army programs, sought out and recruit ed for hire, former members of German military intelligence as well as members of the political intelligence and counter intelligence arms, the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) and the Gestapo. Bloodstone was actively developed by Frank Gardiner Wisner, a former OSS official, head of the CIA's Office of Policy Coordination (OPC) and a strong supporter of the unrestricted use of former German police and intelligence personnel as well as members of other European anti-Communist groups such as the Croatian Ustacha and the Vlasov units. The latter had been a German-controlled military group made up of former Soviet army personnel who had opted to fight for Hitler against Stalin after the German invasion of Russia in June of 1941. 10 In order to support the hiring of Germans, who only recently had been America's bitter enemies, a number of position papers concerning use of Gestapo, SD and SS personnel were prepared and sent to various officials in the American intelligence hierarchy, to include the President himself.

Since the end of the war, an enormous body of literature, motion pictures, television commentar ies and other manifestations of sociological and political propaga nda have appeared that strongly and endlessly endorse the view t hat enormous numbers of Jews were either put to death by poison gas in German camps or shot in the hinterland of captured Soviet territory by German military or police units. It is one of the basic th emes of this thesis that this alleged program of extermination was officially ordered by Adolf Hitler and willingly implemented by his government. In 1948, these allegations were beginning to gain widespread circulation in the Unit ed States and it was to address them that the attached official report was prepared. Initially, it was the contention of various Jewish groups that all of the various German prison camps contained gas chambers and crematoria designed to slaughter an d dispose of as many Jews as could be found under German control. Eventually it was been decided after a great deal of research by German and American historians that while many inmates in these camps died during their confinement, the actual major death camp, complete with the huge gas chambers and even larger crematoria was located at the town of Auschwitz, a city of 10,000 in Silesia, Germany. It was to this huge work camp complex, they have been led to believe, that an enormous number of Europe's Jews were sent, specifically to be gassed to death and their corpses burnt in enormous coke ovens. The figures of the dead had a decided tendency to expand with the telling until by 1948, the number of six million dead was generally accepted as fact. In the intervening years, the figure of six million has been affirmed and reaffirmed by Jewish, and many non-Jewish, writers, made the subject of many media dr amas and is generally accepted by the public as factual.

They also discover very quickly that this conformity is not only necessary but mandatory. Any historian, no matter how reputable or exact in their research, who brings this end total into any kind of question discovers that they have run into an extraordinarily powerful entity that very effectively blocks any sort of balanced investigation into the accuracy of the figures of Jewish dead.

Kennan, department expert on Soviet concerns. Its stated purpose was to thwart Soviet expansionism but its actual mandate was to create dissension within the newly-acquired territories of the Soviet Union, di ssension that specifically included the fostering of armed rebellions by various ethnic groups. In order to facilitate this, Kennan’s plan envisioned the use of any and all of the natural internal enemies of the Communist empire as well as the utilization of Stalin ’s former enemie s such as ex- Gestapo, SD and Abwehr agents, non-German entities such as the Croatian Ustacha, members of the Hungarian Arrow Cross party and many others. Immediately after the war, wh en there was more cooperation with Soviet Russia, members of these agencies were, at the insistence of the Soviets, arrest ed, tried and often executed for their activities in conquered Russian territory. In the German arena, many SD and Gestapo personnel, some formerly operatives at the highest levels of government, were clandestinely recruited for work against the Soviet Union. This recruitment was partially aided by use of the numerous wanted lists prepared at the end of the war.

Schreiber, whose wartime activiti es in spreading these diseases among members of the Soviet milit ary and civilian populations made him particularly desirable, was eventually exposed and had to leave America. Bloodstone openly recruited anyone whom they felt would be of value, regardless of any existi ng allegations of war crimes by any entity, including Soviet Russia and the United States itself.

He was thwarted by ROOSEVELT’S death and by the dangerous American military presence in Western Europe in 1945. As it was obvious that the new President was far less cooperative with Soviet aims than his predecessor, STALIN embarked on a program of terrorism, military threats and subversion, a program still in force and still extremely dangerous to American interests. The Soviet view is that American economic assistance to Europe is antithetical to their pl ans for the destabilization of that region and the subsequent take-over by Soviet-friendly local Communist parties. They have been thwarted in their goals in Greece and Italy but, in their view, U.S. attitudes towards Germany is considered by the Kremlin as being extremely dangerous for the Soviets. A new German military resurr ection is of the greatest concern to STALIN followed by American economic assistance and, as they see it in Moscow, eventual American economic control over German economic development. In order to drive a wedge between current American policy towards Germany and the American people, the Soviets have embarked on an extensive propaganda program aimed at creating a situation wherein the American public will refuse to support further U.S.-German rapprochement. This propaganda mainly deals with German wartime atrocities, or alleged atrocities. T he most important aspect of this campaign deals with the German concentration camps and specifically with purportedly huge numbers of Jews being deported, incarcerated in these camps, tortured, put to death by lethal gas and cremated in huge numbers. As the Soviets have all of the concentration camp directorate files, it is now possible for them to make any kind of wild and unsubstantiated claim they wish without fear of rejection. "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 34 They have launched an extensive campaign with the assistance of various Jewish writers, historians, political groups and members of the motion picture, pr ess and motion picture entities. This program was commenced during the course of the war by such Soviet literary luminaries as Ilya Ehrenberg and other rabidly anti-German Jews and has been continued without a let up until the present day. It is now known that many documents presented as evidence at the Nuremberg trials after the war were Russian fabrications and this counterfeit ing program is still in effect. The image of thousands of emaciated, naked bodies strewn around the compounds of liberated concentration camps is strongly fixed in the minds of the American public. These bodies are purported to be those murdered by the Germans when in fact, they are victims of the typhus epidemics that raged in all the German camps from 1942 onwards. Most es pecially noted was the camp at Bergen-Belsen liberated by the British. Inmates in this camp had been transferred from Auschwitz in late 1944 and typhus had wreaked havoc in that place since the introduction of lousy Soviet prisoners in mid-1941. There is a great deal of confusion in the public mind about these camps and about the massacre of millions of Jews. Firstly, it is necessary to give a definition of what constituted a Concentration Camp. 1. Definition of Concentration Camps According to German law, a Konzentrationslager (officially abbreviated to KL, but popularly referred to as KZ) provided Schutzhaft (Protective Custody) for persons who had not been legally sentenced to prison by a court of law, and/or for those who, having served a legal sentence, had been ordered further detention by the Gestapo (Secret State Police), Sicherheitsdienst (SD or Security Service) or the Geheime Feldpolizei (Secret Field Police.) Legal definitions for the camps differed widely in the various German-occupied areas of Euro pe. For example, Straflager (Punitive Camps) in Poland were often frequently somewhat similar to prisons,"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 35 and served the same purpose, but the treatment of inmates could correspond to that practiced in concentration camps in Germany. There did not appear to be a definite formula for the establishment of detention centers. New camps often were attached to existing penal institutions. A Konzentrationslager could be added to or use the facilit ies of a Zuchthaus (Penitentiary). An instance of the latter case was the use by the KL ORANIENBURG of the cremat orium at the PLÖTZENSEE Zuchthaus . 12 Concentration camps could be expanded by the addition of, for example a Straflager für Arbeitsverweigerer (Penal Camp for Persons Refusing to Work). Contrary to current legend, all German penal institutions since the turn of the century have made it a standard practice to cremate any dead prisoner and return his ashes to his family. This was especially necessary in the event of the deceased expiring from an infectio us disease such as typhus. PW Dulags (Durchgangslager , or Transit Camps) and internment camps appeared erroneously in some wartime lists as KL’s, probably because the term Dulag could have been applied also to collecting stations of all sorts for Schutshäflinge (Persons in Protective Custody). Movements of inmates from one camp to another, especially from camps in occupied territories to those in the Reich were quite frequent in the last years of the war. For example, in 1944, large numbers of Hungarian Jews, nearly all of those Jews deported from Budapest in that year, were transferred out of Auschwitz KL to other KLs throughout the Reich. 2. Number of Camps and Inmates Because the Soviets have the complete records of the German concentration camp system and refuse to release them, comprehensive reports on this subject, to include estimates of the number of inmates in the KL’s, the complete number of camps in Germany and German-held areas and, most especially, the number of KL inmates who perished during the war, their origins and the means of their deaths is not immediately available. However, as every camp commander was required to submit monthly statistical reports to the main KL directorate and as many copies of these reports exist in various files in the various occupation   12 A Zuchthaus is not a concentration camp but a civil penitentiary."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 36 zones of Germany, it has been possible to reconstruct much of this information. Because of its patent falsity, no documentation from either Soviet or Jewish sources has been utilized. A reliable report of October, 1943 concerning the camps in Poland mentioned the existence of 109 camps in that country, divided into the following types:  Nine Transit Camps   Twenty-four KL’s   Three large forced labor camps   Sixty smaller forced labor camps   Three camps for priests   Nine camps for Jews One camp “for the improvement of the Nordic race.” Some wartime sources have estimated the number of Germans who had been inmates at various periods during the years 1933 to 1944 to be between 750,000 and 1,300,000 The most conservative estimate of the number of persons in “protective custody” in Germany proper in July of 1944 was from 170,000 to 370,000. The number of KL inmates in Germany proper in the last months of the war has been estimated to be between 300,000 and 500,000. Of this number, a significant percentage consisted of “racially pure” Germans, as defined by Nazi law. A large percentage of these inmates were engaged in labor projects, often for the Organization Todt- OT and other labor and auxiliary organizations. The largest camp complex located in the east was Auschwitz which was primarily considered a work camp for the SS and often had between 50,000 and 70,000 inmates of all origins on their rolls. 3. Commitment and Release The Einweisung in KL’s (Commitment to Concentration Camps) was effected by both branches of the Sicherheitspolizei (Sipo, or Security Police). "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 37 The Gestapo (both Amt IV or the Reichssicherheitshauptamt RSHA in Berlin and its branches and sub -branches) normally committed and could release those persons charged with, but not sentenced for, political offenses and crimes.

The Kriminal Polizei (Kripo or Criminal Police: both Amt V of the Reichssicherheitshauptamt and its branches and sub-branches committed “BV’s” (Berufsverbrecher or habitual criminals) and also was able to order their release. 4. Administration German Concentration Camps were controlled by the SS Wirtschafts- und Verwalltungshauptamt (SS Economic and Administrative Department) and the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (Department of National Security, which was the head office of the Gestapo and the Security Service). Both of these departments formed part of the Reichsführung-SS (SS High Command). The SS Wirtschafts- und Verwalltungshauptamt (abbreviated to WVHA) administered the camps, having had complete control over all personnel, including the guards and prisoners. One of the chief functions of this department was the supervision of the SS-Unternehmungen (SS Enterprises), for which prison labor was employed. Most camps used the labor of their inmates, and in some cases, Auschwitz in particular, factories were even built either in or near the ca mps to utilize this labor. The WVHA was in charge of the products of such work. The Deutsche Ausrüstungswerke DAW or German Equipment Works), one branch of which was located in ORANIENBURG, had a main office in Berlin, and in liaison with the WVHA took a share in the production activity of the camps. The WVHA, whose Headquarters were in Berlin, was divided into several Amtsgruppen or sub-branches.

The following Ämter (Departments) were contained within Amtsgruppe D : Amt I This was Zentralamt (Central Department), which was headed by SS Obersturmbannführer Artur LIEBENSCHERL and was responsible for general policy, security arrangements, public relations and coordination of th e other departments within the Amtsgruppe. Amt II This was headed by SS Obersturmbannführer Gerhard MAURER. This department had charge of the general administration of prisoners.

Camp Organization Richard GLÜCKS as head of Amtsgruppe D was the Führer der Totenkopfverbände und Konzentrationslager (Commander of the Death’s Head Formations and Commissioner of Concentration Camps.) "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 39 While the methods of organization and administration of camps differed in the various German-held sections of Europe, the following outline is fairly representat ive of the basic structure of such establishments. The most important man in any camp was the Politische Kommissar (Political Kommissar). He was a Gestapo official from the Politische Abteilung (Political Section). This section was subordinated to the Gestapo and Amt VI (Sicherheitsdienst through Amt IV (Gestapo) , both of which were part of the Reichssicherheitshauptamt RSHA, or Department of National Security). Regional control was exercised by the Gestapo through its Leitstellen and Stellen, and by the Sicherheitsdienst through its Leitabschnitte and Abschnitte. In some respects, the Political Commissar in a camp was the superior of the Lagerkommandant (Camp Commandant) and could even have the latter removed. Normally, however, he did not interfere with the administration of a camp, except in an emergency. A Political Commissar received double the pay of a Lagerkommandant and, in addition, RM 45 daily for travel allowance. The rank of a Lagerkommandant was usually in accordance with the importance and size of the camp of which he was in charge. He worked closely with the Political Commissar, and was jointly responsible with the latter for the conduct of the camp, but in addition he was responsible for the safety of the camp. The camp guards were under the command of their own officers, but the latter executed t he orders of the camp Commandant insofar as such duties as posting of guards and sentries are concerned. As deputies, the Commandant had one or more Lagerführer (Camp Sub-commanders), the number depending upon the size of the camp; they generally held the rank of SS Untersturmführer (2nd Lieutenant), and functio ned as section leaders. Another post was the Rapportführer, who called the prisoner rolls. "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 40 Under the Commandant, as adjutant and general supervisor, was the Hauptwachmeister (Chief Warden), a post that was often filled by the CO of the SS guards. He controlled the Platzmeister (Wardens) who had charge of working parties. Under each Lagerführer , as his NCO, was an Arbeitsdienstführer (Works Supervisor , who was in direct contact with the inmates and kept a record of the work to be performed by them. Assisting the Arbeitsdienstführer were Vorarbeiter (Foremen) and Arbeitskapos (Labor or Works Supervisors). These foremen and overseers were usually chosen from among those prisoners who were serving court sentences for common crimes and who were committed to the camps by the Criminal Police rather than by the Secret State Police. In some camps, they were graded and known as Kapos (supervisors) and Haupt-Kapos (Chief Supervisors). These superiors could either wear an armband with the inscription Kapo on the left upper arm or Gefreiterwinkel ( sleeve rank chevrons similar to Wehrmacht corporals). In charge of the living quarter s in the camps are Blockführer (Block Leaders). Prisoner parties which worked outside the camps, under the supervision of a Kommandoführer were known as Kommandos. . There were usually two guards for every five prisoners, and every third guard was armed with a submachine gun. Among the inmates the Lagerältester (Camp Senior Inmate) held the most privileged position. He received his orders from the Lagerführer , and in some instances, was reported to be the “right hand man” of the Lagerkommandant . Ranking below the foregoing prisoner officials were the Blockältester, comparable to an Army First Sergeant; the Blockschreiber , who was comparable to a Company Clerk, and the Steubenälteste (Room Wardens), who were prisoners in charge of rooms. In the main, there were two doctors in each camp, one attending to the SS personnel and the other to the inmates. The"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 41 nurses or medical orderlies were largely recruited from among the inmates. The great majority of all camps were basically self- administered by trusted inmates and not SS personnel; This has been a general overview of the administration of the camps in the German prison systems. Although, as noted above, the complete files of the system fell into Soviet hands and are not accessible, a great deal of material on these camps has survived in areas under Allied occupation and it is, therefore, possible to form reasonably accurate assessments of each of the major camps. As the Soviets are now claiming that the camp complex at Auschwitz in former German Silesia was a “great extermination camp for Soviet prisoners of war and large number of Jews,” perhaps it would be instructive to study this particular camp. Auschwitz was an enormous work camp at the confluence of several rivers and had been chosen by the senior SS establishment as a site for factories. It initially occupied the barracks of a former Imperial Austrian artillery unit, la ter taken over by the Poles. There was an extensive and very important artificial rubber (Buna) factory and a large system designed to manufacture gasoline out of coal, that resource being plentiful in the region. After the introduction of Soviet prisoners of war post June 1941, terrible outbreaks of typhus occurred in Auschwitz and the death tolls were enormous. Because the SS rented their prisoners out to over a hundred small German firms, it was imperative for them to take steps to halt this typhus epidemic. This was never completely accomplished and inmates transferred from Auschwitz to other camps merely spread the disease. Rumors were begun in 1942-1943 by British intelligence, that “many thousands” of Jewish prisoners were being gassed in huge “gas chambers” and their bodies burnt. "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 42 It is entirely true that any prisoner in German custody, be them political prisoners, professional criminals or Jews, were cremated upon their death and, at le ast in the beginning, their ashes sent to their families. During the war this was not possible and ashes were merely dumped into a nearby river. It is important to note that it was absolutely vital to cremate the infected corpses of the many typhus victims and this may well have been the origin of the gas chamber/cremation story now being put about by Soviet propagandists. Plans of the Auschwitz camp exist and it can be said categorically that no gas chambers for the killing of any prisoners existed in the camp. What did exist were rather small delousing chambers to kill the lice carrying typhus that could be found in the clothing of newly arrived Polish and Russian prisoners. Inmate clothing was confiscated and shipped to Germany as raw material and each inmate was issued clean prison garb. Also, the heads of all arriving prisoners were shaved to prevent the spread of body lice and all inmates were subject to showers with medicated soap whose purpose was to kill any lice remaining on the body. Now, DDT is used for this purpose but this compound did not exist in Germany at the time. Apparently the soap was not entirely effective and permitted the spread of typhus in the camps. Political Analysis The Soviets are deeply concer ned with the U.S. use, and intended use, of former German military and security personnel. In order to counter what they see as a potential threat from their former, bitter enemies, they have embarked on a campaign very similar to ones used by British propagandists in the 1914-1918. The similarities are quite remarkable all in all. Then, the German were accused of raping nuns, cutting off their hands, throwing babies up into the air and catching them on bayonets and other fabrications. Much of this was taken, in toto, from reports on Belgian atrocities in the Congo some time before. The British also introduced the story about turning human bodies into soap by rendering their fat. This same story became prevalent during their anti-German campaigns during the late conflict."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 43 It is interesting to note that there is a considerable body of evidence that the British authoritie s utilized the services of GLÜCKS in setting up British detention centers in Palestine during their on- going war with Zionist terrorist groups prior to the creation of the current state of Israel. There is no effective way of dealing with this anti-German propaganda. It is considered unproductive to make any attempt at refutation of the growing legends because the worldwide Jewish community is now supporting and exploiting the Soviet propaganda and are obviously utilizing it for their own ends. Since a significant number of former German SS and SD personnel are now employed by American intelligence, it is recommended that any material concerning the use of these individuals be strictly limited in its dissemination and that any records now extant be accorded the greatest security protection.” Official Record of all Prisoners in Auschwitz Concentration Camp from May of 1940 through December of 1944.

Many of these were too old or too sick to travel and they were left in their barracks, guarded by a Polish militia that had been raised earlier by Hans Frank, the head of the Government General (as occupied Poland was termed by the Germans.) With the approach of the Soviet army in early 1945, these Polish guards indiscriminately attacked the barracks with the prisoners inside, using hand grenades and machine guns. The violent animosity of the Catholic Poles to their huge Jewish community is certainly well known. When the Russians invaded Poland in 1920, one of t he greatest fears of the Polish leadership and the government was that the 500,000 Jewish residents of Warsaw’s Nalevski distri ct would rise up against them in support of the advancing Bolshevik armies. Many Polish Jews fled after the failure of the Russian attack and a number of those left behind were promptly massacred by Poles when the central government collapsed after the German invasion of 1939. Although exact figures of the dead among the remaining Auschwitz inmates in 1945 are not available, several existing Soviet military reports put the death toll between 7,000 and 10,000. Former members of the Polish militia have subsequently claimed that many of the dead were shot down by Russian troops as they attempted to exit the liberated camp. The Russians did not like Jews either, remembering their savagery against them during t he salad days of Josef Stalin. 14 The truth of this matter will never be known but at least this is an atrocity that cannot be blamed on the Germans who were hundreds of miles away at the time.

In his letter, Dr. Browning was partially correct. The 'speech' was in the form of a documentary record taken by Reichsleiter Martin Bormann, Hitler's secretary, at a closed meeting held in Hitler's headquarters on 16 July 1941. It was neither a speech nor a monologue but a précis of a high level conference concerning, primarily, the administration of newly acquired territory in Russia . This précis speaks for itself, certainly without any need for assistance or interpretation, and a translation is supplied so that the reader may judge for himself the specifics of what Dr. Browning has termed the \"implementation of the Final Solution.\" Dr. Browning's article focuses on the decision for a final solution which he defines as the Germans \"attempt to murder every last Jew in Europe.\" He claims that there were two decisions for implementation of this purported program. The first was made in mid- July of 1941 and was specifically directed towards the \"total mass murder of Soviet Jewry.\" It is the first decision that is now under consideration. Dr. Browning states: \"In mid-Ju ly, convinced that the military campaign was nearly over and victor y was at hand, an elated Hitler gave the signal to carry out an accelerated pacification and racial 'cleansing' \" of the newly acquired territories in European Russia.\" He states further: \"When Hitler gave his 'victory' speech in mid-July,   17 VB Nr. 278 of 5. October 1941; Domarus, 'HITLER-Reden und Proklamationen 1932-1943', Vol.II, Munich, 1965, pps. 1758-1767. 18 Letter from Dr. Christopher Browning to author, 23 November 1994."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 61 instigating the immediate implem entation of the Final Solution on Soviet territory...\" A reading of Dr. Browning's source, Nuremberg document 221-L, does not bear out his thesis in any way whatsoever. The conference, which was certainly not a speech, concerns itself entirely with the administration of the newly acquired territories. The only subjects that even remotely approach Dr. Browning's specific claims refer to the combating of the re cently instituted Soviet partisan movement, the establishment of a security system in the territories and the evacuation of Soviets from the Crimea in order to colonize the area with Germans. There is not one word in the text of this conference that refers to Jews or any theoretical plan for their mass extermination in former Soviet territory or anywhere else. The only possible linkage that could be made is that the discussion concerning the ruthless combating of partisans, who were led by political commissars and high-level Communist Party functionaries, contained such phrases as \"shooting\" and \"rooting out\". Because the leadership of the partisans, the commissars and party leaders, was almost exclusively Jewish in composition, a tenuous co nclusion could be postulated that by destroying the partisan movement, Hitler was calling for the destruction of Jews in the eastern territories. Insofar as the participants in this conference addressing any kind of a \"final solution\" concer ning Jews, there is not one word contained in the notes taken on it that would convince any rational reader that such was the case. Convoluted, inverted logic seem to be the hallmark of fin de siècle historical writers, demi-journalists and ideologues when they deal with the subject of the persecution of Jews in Europe and Russia between 1933 and 1945. Both Dr. Browning's article and the following one by Richard Breitman entitled 'Plans for the Final Solution in Early 1941' in the same journal, contain a number of phrases which strongly indicate that those who write on the subject are reduced to suppositions, theories and, in many cases, fictive renderings and strained couplings of unrelated facts. In Dr. Browning's article can be found the following phrases that tend to support this latter thesis: \"Were Hitler's decisions of"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 62 implementation long preceded by 'basic' decisions and 'secret plans'? Here the historian is necessarily on much more speculative grounds...\"; \"My reasoning in this rega rd is admittedly speculative, as is that of other historians who wr estle with the issue.\" Dr. Browning offers \"scenarios\" which might be acceptable for a playwright or a short story writer but fall short of usefulness to a person attempting to deal with historical fact. The word \"seems\" appears a number of times:.....\"Himmler seems to have known\" and...\"Hitler....seems to have incited similar planning for the murder of European Jewry in mid-July.\" Richard Breitman's article in the same edition of German Studies Review is presented in a sim ilar vein as that of Dr. Browning. 19 Here are found such quotations as: \"Deciphering Hitler's exact intentions at a given time , however, is both tricky and subjective, given his habit of concealment and his disinclination to give explicit, written orders.\"; \"There is a constant pattern of veiling measures against Jews (and other victimized groups) with euphemisms.\" Breitman mentions various meetings of top Third Reich leaders with such comments as: \"There is no record of who else (besides Hitler) was present or exactly what was discussed.\" and \"The content of these meetings of the key authorities on the Final Solution went unrecorded-- or at least no notes of them have survived.\" Breitmann speaks of \"a mbiguous language, euphemisms, and camouflage\" and begins his penultimate paragraph with: \"To my knowledge, neither Heydrich or Himmler referred directly to the date of plans for the Final Solution or of Hitler's authorization of it in a form that has reached posterity.\" In short, both Browning and Breitman make the same points, namely that no written proof is ex tant and that which appears to be a possible proof is neither conclusive nor convincing unless enhanced by tenuous support systems that must be maintained more by wishful thinking than fact. Franciszek Piper discusses this situation when he writes on the number of victims of anti-Semiti sm during the period of the Third Reich. He speaks of the reliance of researchers on \"discrepant and   19 ' Plans for the Final Solution in Early 1941', German Studies Review, October, 1994, pps 483-493."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 63 imprecise data from testimonies and depositions of witnesses, former prisoners, and Nazi functionaries and on court decisions and fragmentary and incomplete records of camp registries, archives and other institutions.\" 20 The former Soviet Archives contain the complete file of the German concentration camp system seized by Soviet troops at Oranienburg camp in 1945. These are not fragmentary records but complete and from these, it is appar ent that the death tolls in all the camps from their beginnings to the end of the war was approximately 400,000. 21 Any researcher who has attempted to discover factual material concerning this subject will attest to the enormous proliferation of published material which started during the war and is still in progress. Since historians tr aditionally pilfer from each other without shame or footnoting, it is a laborious task to attempt to locate specific sources for intentions, orders and statistics. Tracking backwards is a time consuming and completely unrewarding experience and finally, one comes to the realization that has apparently struck Messers Browning, Breitman and others: There are no specifics. This lack of evidence has been explained by statements that certain words were used to denote mass murder. \"Deportation\" means transport to Auschwitz and mass gassings, \"Forced Labor\" means transport to Auschwitz and mass gassings as does \"Emigration\", \"Resettlement\" and so on. The fact that nowhere in the vast archives of captured Germ an documents can be found original documents that specifically addres s any state-ordered deportation   20 'Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp' ed. Gutman and Berenbaum, Indiana University Press, 1994, p. 62. 21 An article on former Soviet archival material appeared in the New York Times of March 3, 1991 and addresses the total figure of 400,000 dead in the camps \"under the Third Reich\". It specifically refers to the 70,000 dead in Auschwitz. The actual figures found on Soviet archival microfilms show a slightly higher figure for Auschwitz, viz 73,000. response by Holocaust advocates to these totals, astonishing in their nature, is that no allowance has been made for \"secret lists\" which, since they are secret, cannot be found."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 64 and murder of Jewish civilians (as opposed to Jewish partisans) could mean either that researchers are incredibly stupid or that no such documents ever existed because there was no such official program. There is no question that Jews, both in Germany and in fact throughout Europe, were deported by official order. Most of these Jews were sent to Auschwitz camp and many died while prisoners and forced laborers but to date t here has never been any reputable documentation produced by any re searcher or historian that establishes the existence of an offi cial governmental policy of mass murder of Jews as a racial entity. When a reputable historical journal publishes an article by an equally reputable academic writer wh o states that a public document contains specific orders by Hitler for the extermination of Jews and that document in fact says absolut ely nothing to support the author's thesis, the question arises as to how many other treatments of this subject have been similarly distorted? The recurring theme seems to be that since everyone knows that these enormous massacres are commonly believe to have occurred, there has to be confirming, official documentation in support of their theories. Since no such documentation exists, historians determined to support their thesis can say, as they repeatedly do, that documentation should exist and since it should exist, the next step is to see to it that it does. Therefore creativity eventually takes the place of objectivity to the terminal detriment of both the histor ian's reputation and the validity of his theory.

Various me asures were now necessary and as proof of this, for example, a statement in an impudent Vichy newspaper that the war against the Soviet Union is a European war, conducted for all of Europe. Obviously, the Vichy paper wishes to say by this hint that the beneficiaries of this war should not be the Germans alone but that all of the European states should profit as well. Essentially, we have not publicized our aims before the world; this is not necessary but the main thing is that we ourselves know what we want. By no means should we make our way more difficult by making unnecessary statements. Such stat ements are unnecessary because where we have the power we do all we can and where we do not have the power, we can do nothing anyway. The motivations of our actions before the world must also have a tactical point of view. We must act here exactly as we did in the cases of Norway, Denmark, Holland and Belgium. In these cases we also said nothing about our intentions and it is sensible to continue this. We repeat again that we are constrained to occupy an area to bring order and security; in the interests of the occupants we must establish control in the interest of tranquility, support, commerce, etc., etc., It is consequently not perceived that by this means we establish the way for more definitive control! All necessary measures-shooting, resettlement etc., we can and should do. We do not wish, however, to prematurely and unnecessarily turn the population into enemies. We shall act, therefore, as if we are exercising a mandate only. We must recognize at the same time that we will never leave these territories. We should deal with this accordingly: 1. Do nothing to push ultimate control but keep such preparations in hand; 2. We proclaim that we come as liberators.

We should not have to be dependent upon the good will of others; we must plan our relations with Rumania in accordance with this principle. Basically we have the task of apportioning this giant cake to suit our needs, so that we are able to: first to control it, second to govern it, and third to profit from it.

All successors of the Führer should know: the security of the nation depends on there being no foreign military presence west of the Urals; Germany must protect this area from all future eventualities. Our iron principle must be and must remain: It must not be permitted for anyone but Germans to bear arms here! This is especially important concerning the question of utilizing the armed assistance of the peoples of occupied territories. This is wrong! This policy can turn against us in the end. Only Germans can bear arms, not Slavs, not Czechs, not the Cossacks or Ukrainians! We should be no means adopt a vacillating policy such as we saw in Alsace before 1918.

Specifically: In the Baltic, the area up to the D una will have to be administered in coordination with Field Marshal Keitel. Reichsleiter Rosenberg stresses that in his opinion treatment of the population should vary from district to district. In the Ukraine, we should commence with a cultural consideration, there we must encourage the cultural awareness of the Ukrainians, must establish a university in Kiev and other similar things. The Reichsmarschall points out that we must first think about securing our own food supply and everything else can come later. (Pertinent question: Is there still a cultural stratum in the Ukraine or are higher class Ukrain ians found only in emigrants from Russia?) Rosenberg continues that there are independent movements in the Ukraine, which deserve encouragement. The Reichsmarschall requests from the Führer information about which areas have been promised to other states. The Führer responds that Antonescu desires Bessarabia and Odessa with an extension leading northwestwards from Odessa. Upon objections from the Reichsmarschall and Rosenberg, the Führer responds that the new borders envisioned by Antonescu contained little outside of the old Rumanian territories. "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 68 The Führer states further that insofar as the Hungarians, the Turks and the Slovaks are concerned, nothing has been promised. The Führer submitted for consideration whether one should add the old Austrian part of Galicia to the General Gouvernment; after objections were expressed, the Führer decided that this area will not be incorporated into the General Go uvernment but still placed under Reichsminister Frank (Lemberg). The Reichsmarschall believes it proper to incorporate various parts of the Baltic territories, for example the forests of Bialystok, into East Prussia. The Führer stresses that the entire Baltic territory must be incorporated into the Reich as a district. Likewise, the Crimea with an extens ive hinterland (area north of the Crimea) should become a district of the Reich ; the hinterland should be as large as possible. Rosenberg expressed his objections because of the Ukrainians living in that area. (Pertinent question: It has occurred to me a number of times that Rosenberg is partial to the Ukrainians; thusly he wishes to aggrandize the former Ukraine to a considerable degree.) The Führer stressed, in addition, that the Volga Colony must become a Reich territory and also the district around Baku; the latter will have to become a German concession (Military colony). The Finns want East Karelia but the Kola Peninsula will be taken over by the Germans because of the nickel mines there. The annexation of Finland as a conf ederated state must be prepared for with all care. The Finns have requested the area around Leningrad; the Führer will level Leningrad to the ground and then give it to the Finns.

The Reichsmarschall stressed the most important aspect for the present was exclusively: Securing of food supplies and, as far as necessary, of trade; securing transportation. The Reichsmarschall emphasized that Koch should be given the Baltic area because he is well acquainted with it, or one should give Koch the Ukraine because he is the personality with the strongest initiative and the best preparatory training. The Führer questioned if Kube could be made Reichskommissar for the Moscow area; Rosenberg and the Reichsmarschall feel that Kube was too old. Rosenberg explained that after repeated interviews, he has apprehensions that Koch would very quickly ignore his instructions; in general, Koch had so indicated himself. The Reichsmarschall pointed out that Rosenberg should not exert constant control, rather, these people must be very independent. For the Caucasus area, Rosenberg put forward his chief of staff, Schickendanz. He stated that Sc hickendanz would fulfill his task well, something the Reichsmarschall doubted. Rosenberg then stated that Lutze had proposed that he appoint several SA leaders, namely Scheppmann for Kiev, -Manthey-Dr. Bennecke-Litzmann- for Estonia, and Bürgermeister Dr. Drexler for Latvia. The Führer expressed no objections to the employment of SA leaders. Rosenberg then explained he had received a letter from Ribbentrop requesting participation by the Foreign Office; he requested the Führer to determine that the internal formation of the newly acquired areas are not the concern of the Foreign Office. the Führer is in agreement with this.

Therefore it would be best to put Koch there; if Sauckel were to be used, it would be better to appoint him to the Baltic area.

The Führer wishes that Holz be used as well and that the administration of the Crimea be taken over by Gauleiter Frauenfeld. Rosenberg explains he intended also to use Hauptmann von Petersdorff; general consternati on, general rejection. The Führer and the Reichsmarschall declare that von Petersdorff was without doubt mentally ill. Rosenberg explains further that Oberbürgermeister Stroelin of Stuttgart has been suggested to him as an appointee. There were no objections to this. Since both the Reichsmarschall and Rosenberg both agree that Kube is too old for the Moscow dist rict, Kasche will take over this district. (Note for Pg. Klopfer: Please request immediately from Dr. Meyer the documents on the proposed organizations and on the proposed appointments.) The Reichsmarschall emphasizes he wishes to give the Kola Peninsula to Gauleiter Terboven for exploitation. The Führer is in agreement with this. The Führer emphasizes that Lohse, provided he feels equal to this task, should take over the Baltic area, Kasche Moscow, Koch the Ukraine, Frauenfeld the Crimea, Terboven Kola and Schickendanz the Caucasus. Rosenberg then brought up secu rity for the administration.

The inhabitants should be aware that those who did not perform their duties were liable to be shot and that they would be held accountable for each assault. Following a question by Reichsleiter Rosenberg, the Führer responded, newspapers- also for example in the Ukraine- must be reestablished to serve as sources of information for the inhabitants. After the recess, the Führer declared that we must understand that today's Europe is nothing but a geographical term; in reality, Asia extended up to our former borders. Reichsleiter Rosenberg then described the organizational structure he intended to establish; he did not intend to appoint a permanent deputy for the Reichskommissar but rather call upon the services of the most efficient of the General Commissars to deputize for the Reichskommissar.

This article has been selected because it shows very clearly that theory has replaced fact in ‘Holocaust’ reportage. Rather than reprint the entire Breitman article in toto , significant sections of it will be set forth and then rebutted. Plans for the Final Solution in Early 1941 by Richard Breitman American University In the last fifteen years hist orians have felled many trees debating whether the Nazi regime had long planned or hastily improvised the Holocaust. This controversy has often focused on a seemingly small matter of timing: determination of the date when the SS moved to a continent wide program of mass murder, which they euphemistically called the Final Solution of the Jewish Question.' The date of a decision to embark on the Final Solution is not only of interest in itself, but also because it helps us establish with greater precision the range of influences on, and participants in, the process- in laymen's terms, the ca uses and the villains. In some ways, however, the significance of the move to a continent- wide program has been overemphasized. As I have argued in The Architect of Genocide : Himmler and the Final Solution and elsewhere, the SS adopted the notion of mass murder as a partial solution to the Jewish question in Germany before the war broke out in September 1939, and it began implementing it against the handicapped and on a smaller scale against Jews during 1939- 40. Henry Friedlander has argued conv incingly that with regard to decision making, personnel, and technique, the killing program for the handicapped served as a model for the Final Solution.' These early killings, not to ment ion the assignment of Einsatzgruppen and Order Police battalions to the forthcoming campaign against the USSR well before June 1941, more than amply demonstrate the murderous intentions of Hitler, Himmler, and other key Nazi leaders. Premeditated mass murder was neither a last resort, after other schemes had been tried and found wanting, nor an unforeseen"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 74 escalation of persecution under the pressures of a bitter war-to-the- death on the Eastern front. Still, the move to \"cleanse\" the entire continent of Jews certainly was a major escalation in the area of implementation. What can we determine about how, when, and why this turn occurred? Can we do better than to look at the date when killing on a scale began? Can we trace earlier preparations for genocide? If we focus upon Adolf Hitler, we are drawn to the period beginning in December 1940. On December 18 Hitler formally authorized Operation Barbarossa, the campaign to invade, conquer, and destroy the Soviet Union- his long-sought geopolitical and ideological goal. His idea of destroying Jewry was equally longstanding, even if one rejects the view that he had made an unalterable decision or fixed his mi nd only upon mass murder. Now a vast military operation would provi de opportunities and cover for the liquidation of racial enemies in the East. Deciphering Hitler’s exact intentions at a given time, howev er, is both tricky and subjective, given his habit of concealment and his disinclination to give explicit, written orders. Comment: “Tricky and subjective” are the operative words here. Since Hitler openly proclaimed that he wished to force all the Jews out of Germany and, later, out of conquered territories, Breitman seems puzzled that there doesn’t seem to exist anything specific from Hitler about killin g Jews. There is a considerable difference between deporting Jews to Polish work camps and killing them. In all of his public speeches and recorded private utterances, there is nothing whatsoev er about killing Jews but a great deal about deporting them. In any case, one of the lessons of the internationalist- functionalist controversy is that a st rictly Hitler-centered interpretation will not convince those who doubt Hitler’s invo lvement in some areas of policy or his efficacy. It is nec essary to find evi dence that others sought to translate Hitler’s wishes or goals into reality. Here Gotz Aly and Susanne Heim have uncovered important new evidence regarding the role of technocrats-the “planning intelligentsia” in a number of different agencies and organizations early in the war-in the move toward genocide.’ These men found practical benefits in the mass murder of the Jews and prepared proposals for their political superiors. Exclusive focus on the role of midlevel"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 75 bureaucrats, however, can create at least as many interpretive problems and objections as concentration on Hitler alone. A general file in Himmler’s office or even in the Reich Security Main Office on the Final Solution of the Jewish question, comparable to the folder in the Fore ign Office (RSHA) that contained the one surviving copy (out of thir ty that were made) of the Wannsee Conference summary, did not surviv e the war. We need, therefore, to reconstruct what was going on at the highest reaches of the SS at the end of 1940 and the beginning of 1941. Comment: There is extant a complete copy of the Wannsee Conference protocol. It comes from the personal files of Heinrich Müller, SS-Gruppenfüherer and head of Section IV (Gestapo) of the RSHA. Müller was a participant at the conference which was called to clarify the opposing positions of Göring and Goebbels with regards to a large number of Jews then residing in Berlin. Goebbels, the Gauleiter of Berlin, wished to deport the Jews to the remote areas of Poland while Göring protested to Hitler that many of these Jews were technicians and vital to the war effort. In the end, Göring prevailed and the conference was called specifically to determine which Jews were to be left in place in their jobs and which were to be deported. The document now on displa y at the site of the Wannsee conference is a post-war fake, concocted, like so many other documents, for the Nuremberg trials and bears no resemblance to the original protocol. Adolf Eichmann, the Jewish specialist in the Reich Security Main Office, provided one major clue about SS and RSHA preparations for the Final Solution. In mid-March 1941, during a meeting at the Propaganda Ministry regarding the evacuation of Jews from Berlin, Eichmann announced to rival bureaucrats that the Fuhrer had already entrusted Heydrich with the “final evacuation”( entgültigengen Judenevakuierung ) of the Jews. In this context, Eichmann specifically di scussed only German Jews (and those in recently annexed Bohemia -Moravia), but his comment may have referred to a general policy that was still secret”. Comment: Eichmann was in charge of the transportation of prisoners to the concentration camps. He served under Heinrich Müller in the Gestapo. Note that Breitman states that “his comment may have referred to...” (emphasis added). Breitman’s entire hypothesis is filled wi th such qualifications."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 76 The wording of Nazi documents was often inexact, but for particular reasons which do not advance Browning’s functionalist argument. There is a consistent pattern of veiling measures against Jews (and other victimized groups) with euphemisms. The gassing of mental patients in the General Go vernment during 1940,for example, was described as “evacuation.”’ Whatever Eichmann said in mid- March 1941 very likely understated th e lethal implications of RSHA plans. Even so, ‘final evacuation’ is at least evocative. Eichmann gave his audience a little background on the timing of the Fuhrer’s authorization. Eight to ten weeks earlier (in early to mid-January) Heydrich had presented a proposal to the Führer, Eichmann said, which remained unfulfilled only because the General Government of Poland was not yet in a position to receive even one Jew or Pole from the Old Reich. Comment: Here we have an excellent example of the dichotomy of this entire article: Reference is made to transporting Jews and Poles to camps in Poland. In the mind of Breitman, transportation is the secret word fo r ‘extermination.’ This article is a study in such “secret words” with hidden meanings . Browning‘s interpretation here is that Eichmann was referring simply to the already we ll-known “third short-range plan” (deporting Jews from Vienna and Poles from the incorporated territories to the General Government) concocted by Heydrich, not some secret and more lethal second plan for deporting German Jews, let alone all European Jews. (Of course, if Heydrich drew up plans which he labeled as short range, he likely had a long-range conception, too.) Browning also refers to Hitler’s near simultaneous discussions with Hans Frank and some luncheon comments to Goebbels and Frank on March 18 to maintain that Hitler had made no immediate decisions on Jewish policy, and that, for the short term, “pragmatic considerations about Jewish labor were given priority over ‘racial experimentation.” Were Hitler, Himmler, and Heydrich capable of developing radical ideas and concealing them from officials such as Frank and Goebbels? Did they operate in a conspiratorial manner on such matters? Himmler and Heydrich were both inured in the world of espionage and its methods, and as I will demonstrate below, they also practiced secrecy and deception with the Final Solution."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 77 Comment: Breitman here displays the basis thesis for his work: Could they have done this? Might they have do ne that? He will convince himself and try to convince others that they certainly did do the things he claims. Hitler had advocated the killing of the genetically deficient well before the war, but signed in October 1939 a general authorization to the program on his own private stationery only after it became necessary to protect the bureaucrats in charge and obtain the collaboration of physicians. This written authorization reached enough people to cause trouble for Hitler once news of the (unpopular) “euthanasia” killings began to leak out, and this may explain why Hitler apparently did not authorize the Final Solution on paper? He and the Fuhrer Chancellery were already experienced, if not adept, at conspiracy to cover up mass murder by 1941. One of the key “euthanasia” conspirators, Viktor Brack of the Fuhrer Chancellery, also had some knowledge of the state of Jewish policy by March 1941. Brack was a well-informed observer, an old acquaintance of Himmler, and a colonel in the SS. In postwar interrogations he certainly tried at times to give testimony favorable to himself, but he had no particular interest in giving false testimony regarding dates. Brack’s testimony , combined with one key surviving original document, can help us clarify the meaning of Eichmann’s comments at the Propaganda Ministry. After Brack explained that he and two close colleagues had lobbied for shipment of Jews to Madagascar and mass sterilization of Jews as alternatives to mass murder, American interrogator Fred Rodell summed up: Rodell: There was a general prog ram to kill all Jews. To find a way out, your side made two suggestions: (1) that with Madagascar: and (2) sterilization. Was that the sense? Comment: Shipping unwanted Jews to Madagascar or sterilizing them, inhumane though it might be, does not constitute “kill (ing) all the Jews.” Brack: Yes, that was the sense....

Reichsleiter Philipp Bouhler, head of the Führer Chancellery, said with regard to sterilization, the Führer wanted nothing to do with it . 1 worked further on this project and made a new approach to the Reichsführer SS . (Emphasis added) Let me focus upon the period between December 1940 and January 1941 in an attempt to recreate in chronological order the contracts, climate, and context of policy at the top of the SS. The weight of evidence, which is admittedly and inevitably fragmentary in many places, will show that Himml er and Heydrich were concerned not simply with short-term, limited objectives for newly acquired German provinces, but with broader racial goals fully consistent with Hiller's grandiose rhetoric. On December 9 Himmler spent the afternoon and evening with Göring at the latter's estate at Rominten, discussing a variety of subjects, such as the war against England and the SS's economic operations in concentration camps. (Although they spent ten hours together, Himmler kept only one page of fragmentary notes.) On December 10 Himmler gave a speech at the meeting of Reichsleiter and Gauleiter in Berlin, of which only his handwritten notes survive. He emphasized the need to make t he eastern provinces German by excluding seven of the eight million non-Germans ther e. He called for merciless German domination and for struggle against the Polish intelligentsia. The General Government, he said, would become a reservoir for seasonal laborers whom Germany could exploit. He mentioned a Jewish emigration (Judenauswanderung ) that would leave more space for Poles. Himml er did not specify where Jews would go, but he clearly did not want them to remain in Poland, although Eichmann later, in March 1941,spoke of a final evacuation to Poland. Interestingly, some six weeks before Himmler's speech, the RSHA had banned Jewish emigration from Poland, a fact Himmler apparently did not mention. Was Himmler perhaps thinking of Madagascar for the Jews? The British fleet lay between the continent and Madagascar. By mid- September 1940 it had became clear that Britain would not submit, and that Hitler would not risk an invasi on of the British Isles.1t did not take a genius to see by late1940 that Madagascar was not going to work.(Brack's promotion of Madagascar had come before the end of 1940, he said.)"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 79 After a brief trip to Braunsch weig and to the Netherlands, Himmler then headed to his castle at Wewelsburg, near Paderborn, for several days with the SS elite. At the Nuremberg Trial, Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski referred to a speech made by Himmler during what might be this particular meeting of SS- Gruppenfü h rer . The Reichsführer SS declared openly that one purpose of the forthcoming campaign against the Soviet Union was to decimate the Slavic population by some 30 million peop1e. Comment: The contents of this speech were not recorded at the time and reported by an SS General at his trial some years later. It is self-serving and unsupported statements such as these that liberally stud accounts of the purp orted massacre of Europe’s Jewish population. On December 18, the day Hitler signed the order authorizing Operation Barbarossa, Himmler gave a speech to assembled Waffen-SS commanders in Berlin. He emphasized the interdependence of all parts of the SS, warned against slighting the Death’s Head units formed out of the concentration camp guards, and called for unconditional obedience. That evening he went to the Reich Chancellery. There is no record of who else (besides Hitler) was present or exactly what was discussed. On the following day Himmler met with Heydrich, and on the next day, among others, with Oswald Pohl, head of the SS Budget and Construction Office. Comment: Breitman loves to lard his theories with pointless facts that have no bearing on or support for his badly flawed theories. If Himmler met with Pohl, what possible purpose did it have? Breitman has neglected to inform us of either the purpose or results of this visit. It should be noted that Himmler visited, and was visited by, many prominent individuals during his career. These are only historically significant if notes were kept of the meetings and in their absence, their mention is merely obfuscating and little more than useless nonsense. On January 2, 1941, Heydrich’s office sent out a memo to various RSHA, Security Police, and SD offices announcing that Himmler had approved the establishment of a severity scale within the concentration camp system for different categories of prisoners. Prisoners in “protective custody” cl early capable of rehabilitation, for example, were to be sent to Dachau, Sachsenhausen, and “Auschwitz I.” Severely incriminated prisoners who might still possibly be “educated” an d rehabilitated would be sent to Auschwitz"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 80 I1 and three other camps. There was a particularly unusual element to this announcement: at the time, there was only one camp at Auschwitz. Heydrich already knew that Himmler would soon order an expansion. Comment: If Heydrich was aware that another camp would be built at Auschwitz, considering his very senior position in the SS, this can hardly be considered as an “unusual element” by anyone possessing even a modicum of common sense. Browning elsewhere cautiously accepts the logical and lethal implications of the July 31 mention of a “Final Solution.” He also concludes that in the summer of 1941, probably in July, Hitler authorized the preparation of a pl an for the mass murder of all European Jews. Comment: Brownings’s brilliant conclusions are thoroughly addressed in the previous article. In other words, Browning assumes that in July 1941 Heydrich and Goring knew the real or ultimate meaning of “Final Solution,” whereas in January 1941 Dannecker could not have known it, and in March Eichmann’s comments were supposedly not precisely recorded. A flurry of events in late Janua ry suggests that urgent and important matters were under consideration then. On January 24 Heydrich went out to Göring’s estate at Crainhall (sic Carinhall, ed.) to give a presentation for more than two hours. Shortly afterwards Göring left for Berlin, where he met jointly with Himmler and Heydrich. That same evening he left for Berchtesgaden, and the next day he spent the afternoon and much of the evening alone with the Himmler had been scheduled to leave on a trip to Norway on January 21, but he postponed his departure for at least two days. The content of these meetings of the key authorities on the Final Solution went unrecorded-or at leas t no notes of them have survived. In a speech in the Berlin Sportpalast on January 30, 1941, the eighth anniversary of the Nazi seizure of power, Hitler referred to his prophecy two years earlier: if Jewry brought about another general war in Europe, the result would be the end of the Jewish role in Europe. (This was actually a toned-down summary of a portion of Hitler’s January 30, 1939, speech, in which he had forecast the destruction of the Jewish race.) He added that the Jews might have"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 81 laughed at his prophecy, and that they might still be laughing. The coming months and years would show, however, that he had foreseen things correctly. He looked forward to the day when even Germany’s current enemies would join the front against international Jewish exploitation and parasitism. Adolf Hitler hardly sounded as if he was giving pragmatic consideration greater weight than racial experimentation. To look to Goebbels or Hans Frank for evidence of the unformed state of Jewish policy in March 1941 can be misleading. For reasons some of which Browning himself has already adduced in a past dispute with Martin Brozsat,” Goebbels’s diary and most ( non-SS) sources do not provide effective insight into emerging SS programs. Recent scholarship has clearly demonstrated the often bitter rivalry between Himmler and other Nazi leaders and their respective agencies. It was not common practice in the SS/RSHA bureaucracy to give other government and party agencies information about SS plans before it was absolutely necessary: Himmler used to react most strongly against such indiscretion. We have a perfect example of how Himmler and Heydrich required secrecy amidst the organiza tional competition over Jewish policy, though it comes from ea rly August 1941. After the Reich Commissariat Ostland formulated temporary guidelines for the handling of the Jewish problem th ere, Franz Stahlecker, head of Einsatzgruppe A, issued a blistering critique on the grounds that the Ostland civil authorities were insufficiently radical. In the process Stahlecker revealed that on the Je wish question the Security Police had received fundamental orders that were not to be spelled out in writing. They were connected, how ever, he said, with the impending complete purge of Jews from Europe. Such a ban on explicit statements in writing helps to clarify the significance of ambiguous language, euphemisms, and camouflage in early 1941 documents as well. Given Stahlecker’s statement, any scholar who requires a signed, detailed, and completely unambiguous blueprint for extermination as the only acceptab le evidence of advance planning is creating an artificial standard. Himmler and Heydrich did not operate in this manner. Did the early 1941 SS plans for a Final Solution go beyond a general conception of liquidation of millions of Jews in the East? Early hints about mass extermination camps located at particular sites surfac e with Himmler’s March 1,1941,order to Rudolf Hoess to establish a larger camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau for “prisoners of war,” and Himmler’s April 1941 comment that he had a"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 82 new task in mind for Odilo Globocnik, the man soon put in charge of Operation Reinhard. But whenever the sites were designated, the commitment to plan carefully emerges quite clearly from Dannecker‘s January 21, 1941, memorandum in which he mentioned Heydrich’s Final Solution project. Dannecker had added that implementation would require a huge effort, the success of which could be guaranteed only through the most careful preparations regarding both the deportations and the “settlement action” ( Ansiedlungsaktion ) in territory still to be determined.” This Final Solution project was to be anything but improvised. To my knowledge, neither Heydrich nor Himmler referred directly to the date of plans for t he Final Solution or of Hitler’s authorization of it in a form that has reached posterity. But in November 1941, at a time when most of the specialists agree that the Final Solution was well underway, Heydrich did cast some light on whether his mandate was consist ent over time. In an irritated letter to Quartermaster General Edmund Wagner about the noncooperation of militar y authorities in occupied France with regard to Jewish policy. Heydrich asserted his authority and declared that “The political significance of the measures taken was fully clear to me, since years earlier [my emphasis] I was entrusted with the preparation of the Final Solution in Europe At the level of SS plans, there was a tendency to think big, not small, and long term as well as short term. That tendency did not start suddenly in the summer of 1941. The existence of an early SS plan for the Final Solution undercuts several different interpretations. Those scholars who had discounted Hitler’s fulminations against the Jewish menace as empty rhetoric have to confront the fact that Himmler, Heydrich, Müller, and their subordinates were taking earl y, if not necessarily irreversible, steps to translate racial utopia in to reality. Browning’s stress on Hitler’s euphoria of victory in July and October 1941 might conceivably help to explain the timing of some SS operational moves, but it would be misleading to deduce much about fundamental motives from anything in July and October when a plan was already on the table and in Hitl er’s hands in January. Finally, the notion that Nazi Germany turned to genocide as a last resort after other plans had been tried and had failed, and after Germany’s fortunes in the war had turned bleak now looks simply ludicrous."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"The Final Reckoning 83 Examples of Breitman’s convoluted and very wishful thinking: “Deciphering Hitler’s exact intentions at a given time, however, is both tricky and subjective, given his habit of concealment and his disinclination to give explicit, written orders.” “There is a consistent pattern of veiling measures against Jews (and other victimized groups) with euphemisms ...” “The weight of evidence, which is admittedly and inevitably fragmentary in many places,...” “On December 9 Himmler spent the afternoon and evening with Göring at the latter's estate at Rominten, discussing a variety of subjects, such as the war against England and the SS's economic operations in concentration camps.
