Ireland is still a bone of con-tention between political parties: the Channeltunnel is no nearer completion: and then asnow, when other topics are exhausted, the ”Spec-tator” can fill up its columns with Thought Trans-ference and Psychical Research.But other problems which then were vital,are now almost forgotten. Electric lighting wasa doubtful novelty: Mr. Bradlaugh’s refusalto take the oath excited a controversy which"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"http://booksiread.org21now seems incredible. Robert Louis Steven-son can no longer be adequately described asan ”accomplished writer,” and the introductionof female clerks into the postal service by Mr.Fawcett has ceased to raise alarm lest the cour-teous practice of always allowing ladies to bevictors in an argument should perforce be aban-doned.But in September of the same year we finda cloud on the horizon, the prelude of a com-ing storm. The Trade Union Congress had justbeen held and the leaders of the working classes,with apparently but little discussion, had passeda resolution asking the Government to institutean enquiry with a view to relaxing the strin-gency of Poor Law administration. This, saidthe ”Spectator,” is beginning ”to tamper withnatural conditions,” ”There is no logical halting-place between the theory that it is the duty of"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"22The History of the Fabian Societythe State to make the poor comfortable, and so-cialism.”Another factor in the thought of those daysattracted but little attention in the Press, thoughthere is a long article in the ”Spectator” at thebeginning of 1882 on ”the ever-increasing won-der” of that strange faith, ”Positivism.” It is dif-ficult for the present generation to realise howlarge a space in the minds of the young menof the eighties was occupied by the religion in-vented by Auguste Comte. Of this however moremust be said on a later page.But perhaps the most significant feature inthe periodical literature of the time is what itomits. April, 1882, is memorable for the deathof Charles Darwin, incomparably the greatestof nineteenth-century Englishmen, if greatnessbe measured by the effects of his work on thethought of the world. The ”Spectator” printed"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"http://booksiread.org23a secondary article which showed some appre-ciation of the event. But in the monthly re-views it passed practically unnoticed. It is truethat Darwin was buried in Westminster Abbey,but even in 1882, twenty-three years after thepublication of the ”Origin of Species,” evolutionwas regarded as a somewhat dubious theoremwhich respectable people were wise to ignore.In the monthly reviews we find the same oddmixture of articles apposite to present problems,and articles utterly out of date. The organisa-tion of agriculture is a perennial, and Lady Ver-ney’s ”Peasant Proprietorship in France” (”Con-temporary,” January, 1882), Mr. John Rae’s”Co-operative Agriculture in Germany” (”Con-temporary,” March, 1882), and Professor Sed-ley Taylor’s ”Profit-Sharing in Agriculture” (”Nine-teenth Century,” October, 1882) show that changein the methods of exploiting the soil is leaden-"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"24The History of the Fabian Societyfooted and lagging.Problems of another class, centring round”the Family,” present much the same aspectnow as they did thirty years ago. In his ”In-fant Mortality and Married Women in Facto-ries,” Professor Stanley Jevons (”Contemporary,”January, 1882) proposes that mothers of chil-dren under three years of age should be ex-cluded from factories, and we are at presentperhaps even farther from general agreementwhether any measure on these lines ought tobe adopted.But when we read the articles on Socialism–more numerous than might be expected at thatearly date–we are in another world. Mr. SamuelSmith, M.P., writing on ”Social Reform” in the”Nineteenth Century” for May, 1883, says that:”Our country is still comparatively free from Com-munism and Nihilism and similar destructive"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"http://booksiread.org25movements, but who can tell how long this willcontinue? We have a festering mass of humanwretchedness in all our great towns, which isthe natural hotbed of such anarchical move-ments: all the great continental countries arefull of this explosive material. Can we dependon our country keeping free from the infectionwhen we have far more poverty in our midstthan the neighbouring European States?” Emi-gration and temperance reform, he thinks, mayavert the danger.The Rev. Samuel (later Canon) Barnett inthe same review a month earlier advocated FreeLibraries and graduated taxation to pay for freeeducation, under the title of ”Practicable So-cialism.” In April, 1883, Emile de Lavelaye de-scribed with alarm the ”Progress of Socialism.””On the Continent,” he wrote, ”Socialism is saidto be everywhere.” To it he attributed with re-"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"26The History of the Fabian Societymarkable inaccuracy, the agrarian movementin Ireland, and with it he connected the factthat Henry George’s new book, ”Progress andPoverty,” was selling by thousands ”in an ul-tra popular form” in the back streets and alleysof England. And then he goes on to allude toPrince Bismarck’s ”abominable proposition tocreate a fund for pensioning invalid workmenby a monopoly of tobacco”!Thirty years ago politics were only intermit-tently concerned with social problems. On thewhole the view prevailed, at any rate amongstthe leaders, that Government should interferein such matters as little as possible. Pauperismwas still to be stamped out by ruthless deter-rence: education had been only recently andreluctantly taken in hand: factory inspectionalone was an accepted State function. LordBeaconsfield was dead and he had forgotten his"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"http://booksiread.org27zeal for social justice long before he attainedpower. Gladstone, then in the zenith of hisfame, never took any real interest in social ques-tions as we now understand them. Lord Salis-bury was an aristocrat and thought as an aris-tocrat. John Bright viewed industrial life fromthe standpoint of a Lancashire mill-owner. WilliamEdward Forster, the creator of national educa-tion, a Chartist in his youth, had become thegaoler of Parnell and the protagonist of coercionin Ireland. Joseph Chamberlain alone seemedto realise the significance of the social problem,and unhappily political events were soon to de-flect his career from what then seemed to be itsappointed course.The political parties therefore offered verylittle attraction to the young men of the earlyeighties, who, viewing our social system withthe fresh eyes of youth, saw its cruelties and"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"28The History of the Fabian Societyits absurdities and judged them, not as oldermen, by comparison with the worse crueltiesand greater absurdities of earlier days, but bythe standard of common fairness and commonsense, as set out in the lessons they had learnedin their schools, their universities, and theirchurches.It is nowadays not easy to recollect how widewas the intellectual gulf which separated theyoung generation of that period from their par-ents. ”The Origin of Species,” published in 1859,inaugurated an intellectual revolution such asthe world had not known since Luther nailedhis Theses to the door of All Saints’ Church atWittenberg. The older folk as a rule refused toaccept or to consider the new doctrine. I rec-ollect a botanical Fellow of the Royal Societywho, in 1875, told me that he had no opin-ions on Darwin’s hypothesis. The young men of"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"http://booksiread.org29the time I am describing grew up with the newideas and accepted them as a matter of course.Herbert Spencer, then deemed the greatest ofEnglish thinkers, was pointing out in porten-tous phraseology the enormous significance ofEvolution. Professor Huxley, in brilliant essays,was turning to ridicule the simple-minded credulityof Gladstone and his contemporaries. Our par-ents, who read neither Spencer nor Huxley, livedin an intellectual world which bore no relationto our own; and cut adrift as we were from theintellectual moorings of our upbringings, recog-nising, as we did, that the older men were use-less as guides in religion, in science, in philos-ophy because they knew not evolution, we alsofelt instinctively that we could accept nothingon trust from those who still believed that theearly chapters of Genesis accurately describedthe origin of the universe, and that we had to"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"30The History of the Fabian Societydiscover somewhere for ourselves what were thetrue principles of the then recently invented sci-ence of sociology.One man there was who professed to offerus an answer, Auguste Comte. He too was pre-Darwinian, but his philosophy accepted science,future as well as past. John Stuart Mill, whoseword on his own subjects was then almost law,wrote of him with respectful admiration. Hisfollowers were known to number amongst themsome of the ablest thinkers of the day. The”Religion of Humanity” offered solutions for allthe problems that faced us. It suggested a newheaven, of a sort, and it proposed a new earth,free from all the inequalities of wealth, the pre-ventable suffering, the reckless waste of effort,which we saw around us.

But the critical and destructive partof the case was sound enough. Here was aman who challenged the existing order of so-ciety and pronounced it wrong. It was in hisview based on conventions, on superstitions,on regulations which were all out of date; so-ciety should be reorganised in the light of purereason; the anarchy of competition must be broughtto an end; mankind should recognise that or-der, good sense, science, and, he added, re-"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"32The History of the Fabian Societyligion freed from superstition, could turn theworld into a place where all might live togetherin comfort and happiness.Positivism proposed to attain its Utopia bymoralising the capitalists, and herein it showedno advance on Christianity, which for nineteencenturies had in vain preached social obligationto the rich. The new creed could not succeedwhere the old, with all its tremendous sanc-tions, had completely failed. We wanted some-thing fresh, some new method of dealing withthe inequalities of wealth.Emile de Lavelaye was quite correct in at-tributing significance to the publication of ”Progressand Poverty,” though the seed sown by HenryGeorge took root, not in the slums and alleys ofour cities–no intellectual seed of any sort cangerminate in the sickly, sunless atmosphere ofslums–but in the minds of people who had suf-"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"http://booksiread.org33ficient leisure and education to think of otherthings than breadwinning. Henry George pro-posed to abolish poverty by political action: thatwas the new gospel which came from San Fran-cisco in the early eighties. ”Progress and Poverty”was published in America in 1879, and its au-thor visited England at the end of 1881. So-cialism hardly existed at that time in English-speaking countries, but the early advocates ofland taxation were not then, as they usually arenow, uncompromising individualists. ”Progressand Poverty” gave an extraordinary impetus tothe political thought of the time. It proposedto redress the wrongs suffered by the work-ing classes as a whole: the poverty it consid-ered was the poverty of the wage workers asa class, not the destitution of the unfortunateand downtrodden individuals.

It suggested a method by which wealthwould correspond approximately with worth; bywhich the reward of labour would go to thosethat laboured; the idleness alike of rich andpoor would cease; the abundant wealth cre-ated by modern industry would be distributedwith something like fairness and even equality,amongst those who contributed to its produc-tion.

Georgewrote in a land where the people ruled them-selves, not only in fact but also in name. TheUnited States in the seventies was not yet dom-inated by trusts and controlled by millionaires.Indeed even now that domination and control,dangerous and disastrous as it often is, couldnot withstand for a moment any widespreaduprising of the popular will.

From Henry George Ithink it may be taken that the early Fabianslearned to associate the new gospel with the oldpolitical method.But when we came to consider the plan pro-posed by George we quickly saw that it wouldnot carry us far. Land may be the source of allwealth to the mind of a settler in a new coun-try. To those whose working day was passedin Threadneedle Street and Lombard Street, onthe floor of the Stock Exchange, and in the Bankof England, land appears to bear no relation atall to wealth, and the allegation that the wholesurplus of production goes automatically to thelandowners is obviously untrue. George’s polit-ical economy was old-fashioned or absurd; andhis solution of the problem of poverty could notwithstand the simplest criticism. Taxation toextinction of the rent of English land would only"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"http://booksiread.org37affect a small fraction of England’s wealth.There was another remedy in the field. So-cialism was talked about in the reviews: someof us knew that an obscure Socialist movementwas stirring into life in London. And above allJohn Stuart Mill had spoken very respectfullyof Socialism in his ”Political Economy,” whichthen held unchallenged supremacy as an expo-sition of the science. If, he wrote, ”the choicewere to be made between Communism[1] withall its chances, and the present state of soci-ety with all its sufferings and injustices, if theinstitution of private property necessarily car-ried with it as a consequence that the produceof labour should be apportioned as we now seeit almost in inverse proportion to labour, thelargest portions to those who have never workedat all, the next largest to those whose work isalmost nominal, and so in descending scale,"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"38The History of the Fabian Societythe remuneration dwindling as the work growsharder and more disagreeable until the mostfatiguing and exhausting bodily labour cannotcount with certainty on being able to earn eventhe necessities of life; if this or Communismwere the alternative, all the difficulties, greator small, of Communism would be but as dustin the balance.”[2] And again in the next para-graph: ”We are too ignorant, either of what in-dividual agency in its best form or Socialism inits best form can accomplish, to be qualifiedto decide which of the two will be the ultimateform of human society.”More than thirty years had passed since thishad been written, and whilst the evils of privateproperty, so vividly depicted by Mill, showedno signs of mitigation, the remedies he antic-ipated had made no substantial progress. Theco-operation of the Rochdale Pioneers had proved"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"http://booksiread.org39a magnificent success, but its sphere of opera-tions was now clearly seen to be confined withinnarrow limits. Profit-sharing then as now wasa sickly plant barely kept alive by the labori-ous efforts of benevolent professors. Mill’s in-dictment of the capitalist system, in regard toits effects on social life, was so powerful, histreatment of the primitive socialism and com-munism of his day so sympathetic, that it issurprising how little it prepared the way for thereception of the new ideas. But to some of hisreaders, at any rate, it suggested that there wasan alternative to the capitalistic system, andthat Socialism or Communism was worthy ofexamination.[3]The Socialism of Robert Owen had made aprofound impression on the working people ofEngland half a century earlier, but the tradi-tion of it was confined to those who had heard"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"40The History of the Fabian Societyits prophet. Owen, one of the greatest men ofhis age, had no sense of art; his innumerablewritings are unreadable; and both his later ex-cursions into spiritualism, and the failure of hiscommunities and co-operative enterprises, hadclouded his reputation amongst those outsidethe range of his personality. In later years weoften came across old men who had sat at hisfeet, and who rejoiced to hear once more some-thing resembling his teachings: but I do notthink that, at the beginning, the Owenite tradi-tion had any influence upon us.Karl Marx died in London on the 14th March,1883, but nobody in England was then awarethat the greatest figure in international poli-tics had passed away. It is true that Marx hadtaken a prominent part in founding the Inter-national at that historic meeting in St. Mar-tin’s Town Hall on September 28th, 1864. The"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"http://booksiread.org41real significance of that episode was over-ratedat the time, and when the International dis-appeared from European politics in 1872 thewhole thing was forgotten.In Germany Marxian Socialism was alreadya force, and it was attracting attention in Eng-land, as we have seen. But the personality ofMarx must have been antipathetic to the En-glish workmen whom he knew, or else he failedto make them understand his ideas: at anyrate, his socialism fell on deaf ears, and it maybe said to have made no lasting impression onthe leaders of English working-class thought.Though he was resident in England for thirty-four years, Marx remained a German to thelast. His writings were not translated into En-glish at this period, and Mr. Hyndman’s ”Eng-land for All,” published in 1881, which was thefirst presentation of his ideas in English, did"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"42The History of the Fabian Societynot even mention his name. This book was infact an extremely moderate proposal to rem-edy ”something seriously amiss in the condi-tions of our everyday life,” and the immediateprogramme was no more than an eight hoursworking day, free and compulsory education,compulsory construction of working-class dwellings,and cheap ”transport” for working-class pas-sengers. It was the unauthorised programmeof the Democratic Federation which had beenfounded by Mr. Hyndman in 1881. ”SocialismMade Plain,” the social and political Manifestoof the Democratic Federation (undated, but ap-parently issued in 1883), is a much strongerdocument. It deals with the distribution of theNational Income, giving the workers’ share as300 out of 1300 millions sterling, and demandsthat the workers should ”educate, agitate, or-ganise” in order to get their own.

Un-der the guidance of the Rev. Stewart D. Head-lam[5] its policy of the revived movement wasLand Reform, particularly on the lines of theSingle Tax. The introductory article boldly claimsthe name of Socialist, as used by Maurice andKingsley: the July number contains a long ar-ticle by Henry George. In September a formalreport is given of the work of the DemocraticFederation.

Probably his Scotch common sense re-coiled from definitely taking the plunge: I amnot aware that he ever actually proposed thathis disciples should form a self-contained com-munity.

At the time that I am describingDavidson’s re-statement appealed to the smallcircle of his adherents, though the movementwhich he started had results that he neitherexpected nor approved.I have now indicated the currents of thoughtwhich contributed to the formation of the FabianSociety, so far as I can recover them from mem-ory and a survey of the periodical literature ofthe period.

They were produced, againaccording to tradition, by Frank Podmore, and,though printed as quotations, are not to be dis-covered in any history:–”Wherefore it may not be gainsaid that thefruit of this man’s long taking of counsel–and(by the many so deemed) untimeous delays–was the safe-holding for all men, his fellow-citizens, of the Common Weal.””For the right moment you must wait, asFabius did most patiently, when warring againstHannibal, though many censured his delays;but when the time comes you must strike hard,as Fabius did, or your waiting will be in vain,"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"http://booksiread.org83and fruitless.”It has been pointed out by Mr. H.G.

Taken together as the two mot-toes were first printed, this meaning is obvious.The delay was to be for the purpose of ”takingcounsel.”Tract No. 1, excellent as it is, shows a senseof the evil, but gives no indication of the rem-edy.

The Fabianswere not suited either by ability, temperament,or conditions to be leaders of a popular revo-lutionary party.

Indeed in those days noquestion of amalgamation was ever mooted.But it must be remembered by critics thatso far as concerns the Fabian Society, the ab-sence of identity in organisation has never ledto such hostility as has been common amongstContinental Socialists. Since the vote of cen-sure in relation to the ”Tory Gold,” the FabianSociety has never interfered with the doings ofits friendly rivals.

This is very far fromthe truth. The great provincial municipalitiestook over the management of their water andgas because they found municipal control alikeconvenient, beneficial to the citizens, and fi-nancially profitable: Birmingham in the seven-ties was the Mecca of Municipalisation, and in1882 the Electric Lighting Act passed by Mr.Joseph Chamberlain was so careful of the in-terests of the public, so strict in the limitationsit put upon the possible profits to the investor,"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"184The History of the Fabian Societythat electric lighting was blocked in England forsome years, and the Act had to be modified inorder that capital might be attracted.[22]What the Fabian Society did was to pointout that Socialism did not necessarily mean thecontrol of all industry by a centralised State;that to introduce Socialism did not necessarilyrequire a revolution because much of it couldbe brought about piecemeal by the votes of thelocal electors. And secondly the Society com-plained that London was singularly backwardin municipal management: that the wealthiestcity in the world was handed over to the con-trol of exploiters, who made profits from its gas,its water, its docks, and its tramways, whilstelsewhere these monopolies were owned andworked by public authorities who obtained allthe advantages for the people of the localitiesconcerned.

In London, partly owing to Fabian ad-vocacy and partly because London had at lasta single representative authority with a recog-nised party system, it became the battle groundof the parties: the claim of the Socialists awak-ened the Individualists to opposition: and thetramways of London were held as a trench inthe world-wide conflict between Socialism andits enemies, whose capture was hailed as anomen of progress by one side, and by the otherdeplored as the presage of defeat.”Facts for Londoners” was the work of Sid-ney Webb, but there is nothing in the tract to"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"186The History of the Fabian Societyindicate this.

The reason for the innovation is obvi-ous: this tract was written by a Churchman forChristians, and whilst the Society as a wholeapproved the conclusions, the premises com-mended themselves to but a few.

Aproposition in the Manifesto, Tract No. 2, pub-lished as early as 1884, states that ”men nolonger need special political privileges to pro-tect them against women,” and in all our pub-lications relating to the franchise or local gov-ernment the claims of women to equal citizen-ship were prominently put forward. But we hadpublished no tract specially on the subject ofthe Parliamentary Vote for Women. This wasnot mere neglect. In 1893 a committee wasappointed ”to draw up a tract advocating theclaims of women to all civil and political rightsat present enjoyed by men,” and in March, 1894,it reported that ”a tract had been prepared whichthe Committee itself did not consider suitablefor publication.” Later the Committee was dis-charged, and in face of this fiasco nothing fur-ther was done."},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"http://booksiread.org395Mr. Wells took a strong view on the impor-tance of doing something in relation to womenand children, though exactly what he proposedwas never clear.

The max-imum University membership–on paper–was in1914, when it reached 541 members, of whom101 were at Oxford and 70 at Cambridge. Butthe weakness of undergraduate Socialism is in-dicated by the extraordinary difficulty found inpaying to the parent Society the very moder-ate fee of a shilling a head per annum, andthe effect of attempting to enforce this in 1915,combined with the propaganda of Guild Social-ism, especially at Oxford, was for the momentto break up the apparently imposing array ofUniversity Fabianism.In 1912 Clifford Allen of Cambridge formed"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"http://booksiread.org441the University Socialist Federation, which wasin fact a Federation of Fabian Societies thoughnot nominally confined to them.

In the years ofrapid growth that followed the publication of”Fabian Essays” the London Groups maintaineda fairly genuine existence. London was teemingwith political lectures, and in the decade 1889-1899 its Government was revolutionised by theCounty Councils Act of 1888, the Local Govern-ment Act of 1894, and the London GovernmentAct of 1899 which established the MetropolitanBoroughs. Socialism, too, was a novelty, andthe few who knew about it were in request.Anyway even with the small membership ofthose days, the London Groups managed to per-sist, and ”Fabian News” is full of reports of con-ferences of Group Secretaries and accounts ofGroup activities.

But be-tween the Fabian Society and the I.L.P. friendlyrelations became closer than ever. The diver-gent political policies of the two, the only matterover which they had differed, had been largelysettled by change of circumstances. The FabianSociety had rightly held that the plan of build-ing up an effective political party out of individ-ual adherents to any one society was imprac-ticable, and the I.L.P. had in fact adopted an-other method, the permeation of existing organ-isations, the Trade Unions.

But half ortwo-thirds of the Fabians belonged also to theI.L.P., and nearly all the I.L.P. leaders were orhad been members of the Fabian Society.The suggestion was made in March, 1911,by Henry H.

But grad-ually the organisation was tightened up, and in1907 a scheme was adopted which gave twentyvotes each to the leading nations, and propor-tionately fewer to the others. Moreover a per-manent Bureau was established at Brussels,with Emile Vandervelde, the distinguished leaderof the Belgian Socialists, later well known inEngland as the Ministerial representative of theBelgian Government during the war, as Chair-man.

In our early days it was commonlybelieved to be a rapidly growing evil. Machin-ery was replacing men: the capitalists wouldemploy a few hands to turn the machines onand off: wealth would be produced for the rich,and most of the present manual working classwould become superfluous.

Finally it may be saidthat unemployment is on the whole more preva-lent in Great Britain than elsewhere; the sys-tem of casual or intermittent employment is morewidespread; throughout the Continent the work-ing classes in towns are nearly everywhere con-nected with the rural peasant landowners oroccupiers, so that the town labourer can oftengo back to the land at any rate for his keep;whilst all America, still predominantly agricul-tural, is in something like a similar case.The Fabian Society had since its earliest daysbeen conscious of the problem of unemploy-ment; but it had done little to solve it.

In 1893 we reprintedfrom the ”Nineteenth Century” as Tract No. 47a paper on ”The Unemployed” by John Burns,and we had published nothing else.In fact we found the subject too difficult.There were plenty of palliatives familiar to ev-ery social enquirer; Socialism, the organisationof industry by the community for the commu-nity, we regarded as the real and final rem-edy.

The Dialectical Society, whichwas a centre of the most advanced thought inLondon until the Fabian Society supplanted it,was founded to advocate the principles of Mill’sEssay on Liberty, which was much more theBible of English Individualism than Das Kap-ital ever was of English Socialism. As late as1888 Henry Sidgwick, a follower of Mill, roseindignantly at the meeting of the British Asso-ciation in Bath, to which I had just read thepaper on The Transition to Social-Democracy,which was subsequently published; as one ofthe Fabian Essays, and declared that I had ad-vocated nationalisation of land; that nationali-sation of land was a crime; and that he wouldnot take part in a discussion of a criminal pro-posal.

Sidney Webb astonished andconfounded our Individualist opponents by cit-ing Mill against them; and it is probably due toWebb more than to any other disciple that it isnow generally known that Mill died a Socialist.Webb read Mill and mastered Mill as he seemedto have read and mastered everybody else; butthe only other prominent Socialist who can beclaimed by Mill as a convert was, rather unex-pectedly, William Morris, who said that whenhe read the passage in which Mill, after ad-"},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"584The History of the Fabian Societymitting that the worst evils of Communism are,compared to the evils of our Commercialism, asdust in the balance, nevertheless condemnedCommunism, he immediately became a Com-munist, as Mill had clearly given his verdictagainst the evidence. Except in these instanceswe heard nothing of Mill in the Fabian Society.Cairnes’s denunciation of the idle consumersof rent and interest was frequently quoted; andMarshall’s Economics of Industry was put intoour book boxes as a textbook; but the tastefor abstract economics was no more general inthe Fabian Society than elsewhere.

Iwas so complete a novice in economics at thattime that when I wrote a letter to Justice point-ing out a flaw in Marx’s reasoning, I regardedmy letter merely as a joke, and fully expectedthat some more expert Socialist economist wouldrefute me easily.

Professor Edgeworth and Mr. Wick-steed, to whom Jevons appealed as a mathe-matician, were at that time trying to convincethe academic world of the importance of Jevons’stheory; but I, not being a mathematician, wasnot easily accessible to their methods of demon-stration. I consented to reply to Mr. Wicksteedon the express condition that the editor of To-day, in which my reply appeared, should findspace for a rejoinder by Mr. Wicksteed.

I may go further and admit thatthe first problems the Fabians had to solve wereso completely on the materialist plane that theatmosphere inevitably became uncongenial tothose whose capacity was wasted and whosesympathies were starved on that plane.

This by itself wouldnot imply Socialism at all: it would be merelya revival of the medieval guild, or a fresh at-tempt at the now exploded self-governing work-shop of the primitive co-operators. Guild So-cialism, with the emphasis on the Socialism,implies that the industries, however completelythey may be controlled by their separate staffs,must pool their products.

It can be seen,throughout the history of the Society, how anyattempt to discard the old economic basis of thelaw of rent immediately produced a recrudes-cence of Anarchism in one form or another, thelatest being Syndicalism and that form of GuildSocialism which was all Guild and no Social-ism.

This is not fully accepted as yet inthe movement, in which there is still a strongleaven of the old craving for an easy-going sys-tem which, beginning with ”the socialization ofthe means of production, distribution, and ex-change,” will then work out automatically with-out interference with the citizen’s private af-fairs.Another subject which has hardly yet beentouched, and which also must begin with de-ductive treatment, is what may be called thedemocratization of democracy, and its exten-sion from a mere negative and very uncertain"},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"602The History of the Fabian Societycheck on tyranny to a positive organizing force.No experienced Fabian believes that society canbe reconstructed (or rather constructed; for thedifficulty is that society is as yet only half res-cued from chaos) by men of the type producedby popular election under existing circumstances,or indeed under any circumstances likely to beachieved before the reconstruction.
