114 million years ago, one morning just after sunr ise: The first flower ever to appe ar on the planet ope ns up to receive the rays of the sun. Prior to this mom entous event that heralds an evolutiona ry transf ormation in the life of plants, the planet had already been covered in vegetation for millions of years. The first flower proba bly did not sur vive for long, and flowers must have remained rare and isol ated phe nom ena, since condi tions were most likely not yet favorable for a widespr ead flowering to occur. One day, however, a critical threshol d was reached, and sudde nly there woul d have been an expl osi on of color and scent all over the planet – if a perceiving consc iousne ss ha d be en t here to w itness i t. Muc h later, those delicate and fragrant beings we call flowers woul d com e to play an esse ntial part in the evolution of consc iousne ss of another spe cies. Hum ans woul d increasingly be drawn to and fascinated by them. As the consc iousne ss of hum an beings develope d, flowers were most likely the first thing they came to value that had no utilitarian pur pose for them, that is to say, was not linked in som e way to sur vival. The y provided inspi ration to count less artists, poe ts, and mystics. Jesus tells us to cont emplate the flowers and learn from then how to live. The Buddha is said to have given a “silent sermon” onc e dur ing which he held up a flower and gazed at it. After a while, one of those present, a monk called Ma hakasyapa, began to sm ile. He is said to have been the onl y one who had unde rstood the sermon. According to legend, that sm ile (that is to say, realization) was hande d down by twenty­ eight suc cessi ve m asters a nd m uch l ater be came the or igin of Ze n. Seeing beauty in a flower coul d awaken hum ans, however briefly, to the beauty that is an esse ntial part of their own inne rmost being, their true nature. The first recogni tion of beauty was one of the most signi ficant events in the evolution of hum an consc iousne ss. The feelings of joy and love are intrinsi cally conne cted to that recogni tion. Without our fully realizing it, flowers woul d becom e for us an expr essi on in form of that which is most high, most sacred, and ultimately formless within our selves. Flowers, more fleeting, more ethereal and more delicate than the plants out of which they emerged, woul d becom e like messe ngers from another realm, like a bridge"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"between the world of physical forms and the formless. The y not onl y had a scent that was delicate and pleasing to hum ans, but also brought a fragrance from the realm of spi rit. Using the word “enlight enm ent” in a wider sense than the conventiona lly accepted one , we coul d look upon flowers as the enlight enm ent of pl ants. Any life­form in any realm – mineral, vegetable, animal, or hum an – can be said to unde rgo “enlight enm ent.” It is, however, an extremely rare occurrence since it is more than an evolutiona ry prog ressi on: It also implies a discont inui ty in its developm ent, a leap to an entirely different level of Being a nd, m ost impor tant, a lesse ning of m ateriality. What coul d be heavier and more impenetrable than a rock, the dense st of all forms? And yet som e rocks unde rgo a change in their molecular structure, turn into crystals, and so becom e transpa rent to the light . Som e carbons, unde r inconc eivable heat and pressur e, turn into diamonds, and som e he avy m inerals into o ther pr ecious s tone s. Mos t crawling reptilians, the most earthbound of all creatures, have remained unc hanged for millions of years. Som e, however, grew feathers and wings and turned into birds, thus defying the force of gravity that had held them for so long. The y didn’t becom e better at crawling or walking, but transc ende d c rawling a nd w alking e ntirely. Since time immemorial, flowers, crystals, precious stone s, and birds have held spe cial signi ficance for the hum an spi rit. Like all life­forms, they are, of cour se, tempor ary manifestations of the unde rlying one Life, one Consc iousne ss. The ir spe cial signi ficance and the reason why hum ans feel suc h fascination for and affinity with them can be attribut ed to their ethereal quality. Once there is a certain degree of presence, of still and alert attention in hum an beings ’ perceptions, they can sense the divine life esse nce, the one indw elling consc iousne ss or spi rit in every creature, every life­form, recogni ze it as one with their own esse nce and so love it as themselves.

In the case of a flower, a crystal, precious stone , or bird, however, even som eone with little or no Presence can occasiona lly sense that there is more than the mere physical existence of that form, without kno wing that this is the reason why he or she is drawn toward it, feels an affinity with it. Because of its ethereal nature, its form obsc ures the indw elling spi rit to a lesse r"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"degree than is the case with other life­forms. The exception to this are all newbor n life­forms – babies, puppi es, kittens, lambs, and so on. The y are fragile, delicate, not yet firmly establishe d in materiality.

So when you are alert and cont emplate a flower, crystal, or bird without naming it mentally, it becom es a windo w for you into the formless. The re is an inne r ope ning, however slight , into the realm of spi rit. Thi s is why these three “en­light ened” life­forms have played suc h an impor tant part in the evolution of hum an consc iousne ss since ancient times; why, for example, the jewel in the lotus flower is a central sym bol of Buddhi sm and a white bird, the dove, signi fies the Holy Spirit in Christianity. The y have been preparing the ground for a more profound shi ft in planetary consc iousne ss that is destined to take place in the hum an spe cies. Thi s is the spi ritual awakening t hat we are be ginni ng t o w itness no w. TH E P URPOSE O F TH IS BOOK Is hum anity ready for a transf ormation of consc iousne ss, an inne r flowering so radical and profound that com pared to it the flowering of plants, no matter how beautiful, is onl y a pale reflection? Can hum an beings lose the densi ty of their condi tione d mind structures and becom e like crystals or precious stone s, so to spe ak, transpa rent to the light of consc iousne ss? Can they defy the gravitationa l pul l of materialism and materiality and rise above identification with form that keeps the ego in place and c onde mns t hem to i mprisonm ent within t heir own pe rsona lity? The possi bility of suc h a transf ormation has been the central messa ge of the great wisdom teachings of hum anki nd. The messe ngers – Buddha , Jesus, and others, not all of them kno wn – were hum anity’s early flowers. The y were precursor s, rare and precious beings. A widespr ead flowering was not yet possi ble at that time, and their messa ge became largely misunde rstood and often greatly distorted. It certainly did not transf orm hum an be havior, except in a sm all m inor ity of pe opl e. Is hum anity more ready now than at the time of those early teachers? Why shoul d this be so? What can you do, if anything, to bring about or accelerate this inne r shi ft? What is it that characterizes the old egoi c state of consc iousne ss, and by what signs is the new emerging consc iousne ss recogni zed?

The ideas and conc epts presented here may be impor tant, but they are seconda ry. The y are no more than signpos ts poi nting toward awakening. As you read, a shi ft takes place within y ou. Thi s book’ s main pur pose is not to add new information or beliefs to your mind or to try to convince you of anything, but to bring about a shi ft in consc iousne ss; that is to say, to awaken. In that sense , this book is not “interesting” . Interesting means you can keep your distance, play around with ideas and conc epts in your mind, agree or disagree. Thi s book is about you. It will change your state of consc iousne ss or it will be meaningless. It can onl y awaken those who are ready. Not everyone is ready yet, but many are, and with each person who awakens, the mom entum in the collective consc iousne ss grows, and it becom es easier for others. If you don ’t kno w what awakening means, read on. Only by awakening can you kno w the true meaning of that word. A glimpse is enough to initiate the awakening process, which is irreversible. For som e, that glimpse will com e while reading this book. For many others who may not even have realized it, the process has already begun. Thi s book will help them recogni ze it. For som e, it may have begun through loss or suf fering; for others, through com ing into cont act with a spi ritual teacher or teaching, through reading The Power of Now or som e other spi ritually alive and therefore transf ormationa l book – or any com bination of the above. If the awakening process has begun in you , the reading of this book w ill accelerate and i ntensi fy i t. An esse ntial part of the awakening is the recogni tion of the una wakened you, the ego as it thinks, spe aks and acts, as well as the recogni tion of the collectively condi tione d mental processe s that perpetuate the una wakened state. Tha t is why this book sho ws the main aspe cts of the ego and how they ope rate in the indi vidua l as well as in the collective. Thi s is impor tant for two related reasons: The first is that unl ess you kno w the basic mechanics behind the workings of the ego, you won’t recogni ze it, and it will trick you into identifying with it again and again. Thi s means it takes you over, an impos tor pretendi ng to be you. The second reason is that the act of recogni tion itself is one of the ways in which awakening happe ns. When you recogni ze the unc onsc iousne ss in you, that which makes the recogni tion possi ble is the arising consc iousne ss, is awakening. You canno t fight against the ego and win, just as you canno t fight against darkne ss. The light of consc iousne ss i s a ll that is ne cessa ry.

The words they use to describe those insi ght s differ, yet they all poi nt to a twofold funda mental truth. The first part of this truth is the realization that the “nor mal” state of mind of most hum an beings cont ains a strong element of what we might call dysfunc tion or even madne ss. Certain teachings at the heart of Hindui sm perhaps com e close st to seeing this dysfunc tion as a form of collective mental illness. The y call it maya, the veil of delusi on. Ramana Ma harshi , one of the greatest Indi an sa ges, bl unt ly s tates: “The m ind i s m aya.” Buddhi sm use s different terms. According to the Buddha , the hum an mind in its nor mal state generates duk kha , which can be transl ated as suf fering, unsa tisfactoriness, or just plain misery. He sees it as a characteristic of the hum an condi tion. Wherever you go, whatever you do, says the Buddha , you will encount er duk kha, and it will manifest in every situation soone r or later. According to Christian teachings, the nor mal collective state of hum anity is one of “original sin.” Sin is a word that has been greatly misunde rstood and misinterpreted. Literally transl ated from the ancient Greek in which the New Testament was written, to sin means to miss the mark, as an archer who misse s the target, so to sin means to miss the poi nt of hum an existence. It means to live unski llfully, blindl y, and thus to suf fer and cause suf fering. Again, the term, strippe d of its cultural baggage and misinterpretations, poi nts to the dysfunc tion inhe rent in the hum an condi tion. The achievements of hum anity are impressi ve and unde niable. We have created subl ime works of musi c, literature, painting, architecture, and sculpture. Mor e recently, science and technol ogy have brought about radical changes in the way we live and have enabled us to do and create things that woul d have been consi dered miraculous even two hundr ed years ago. No doubt : The hum an mind is highl y intelligent. Yet its very intelligence is tainted by madne ss. Science and technol ogy have magni fied the destructive impact that the dysfunc tion of the hum an mind has upon the planet, other life­forms, and upon hum ans themselves. Tha t is why the history of the twentieth century is where that dysfunc tion, that collective insa nity, can be most clearly recogni zed. A further factor is that this dysfunc tion is actually intensi fying a nd a ccelerating."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The First World War broke out in 1914. Destructive and cruel wars, motivated by fear, greed, and the desire for power, had been com mon occurrences throughout hum an history, as had slavery, torture, and widespr ead violence inflicted for religious and ideologi cal reasons. Hum ans suf fered more at the hands of each other than through natural disasters. By the year 1914, however, the highl y intelligent hum an mind had invented not onl y the internal com bus tion engi ne, but also bom bs, machine guns, subm arines, flame throwers, and poi son gas. Intelligence in the service of madne ss! In static trench warfare in France and Belgium , millions of men perishe d to gain a few miles of mud. When the war was over in 1918, the sur vivors look in hor ror and incom prehensi on upon the devastation left behind: ten million hum an beings killed and many more maimed or disfigur ed. Never before had hum an madne ss been so destructive in its effect, so clearly visible. Little did they kno w that this was onl y the beginni ng. By the end of the century, the num ber of peopl e who died a violent death at the hand of their fellow hum ans woul d rise to more than one hundr ed million. The y died not onl y through wars between nations, but also through mass exterminations and genoc ide, suc h as the murder of twenty million “class enemies, spi es, and traitors” in the Soviet Union unde r Stalin or the unspe akable hor rors of the Holocaust in Nazi Germany. The y also died in count less sm aller internal conf licts, suc h as the Spanish civil war or dur ing the Khm er Roug e regime in Cambodi a when a quarter of that count ry’s popul ation w as m urdered. We onl y need to watch the daily news on television to realize that the madne ss has not abated, that is cont inui ng into the twenty­first century. Another aspe ct of the collective dysfunc tion of the hum an mind is the unprecedented violence that hum ans are inflicting on other life­forms and the planet itself – the destruction of oxygen­produc ing forests and other plant and animal life; ill­treatment of animals in factory farms; and poi soni ng of rivers, oceans, and air. Driven by greed, ignor ant of their conne ctedne ss to the whol e, hum ans persist in behavior that, if cont inue d unc hecked, can onl y resul t in t heir own de struction. The collective manifestations of the insa nity that lies at the heart of the hum an condi tion cons titute the greater part of hum an history. It is to a large extent a history of madne ss. If the history of hum anity were the clinical case history of a single hum an being, the diagnosi s woul d have to be: chroni c paranoi d delusi ons, a pathol ogi cal prope nsi ty to com mit murder and"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"acts of extreme violence and cruelty against his perceived “enemies” – his own unc onsc iousne ss projected out ward. Criminally insa ne, with a few brief lucid i ntervals. Fear, greed, and the desire for power are the psy chol ogi cal motivating forces not onl y behind warfare and violence between nations, tribes, religions, and ideologi es, but also the cause of incessa nt conf lict in persona l relationshi ps. The y bring about a distortion in your perception of other peopl e and your self. Thr ough them, you misinterpret every situation, leading to misgui ded action designe d to rid you of fear and satisfy your need for more, a bo ttom less hol e that can ne ver be filled. It is impor tant to realize, however, that fear, greed, and the desire for power are not the dysfunc tion that we are spe aking of but are themselves created by the dysfunc tion which is a deep­seated collective delusi on that lies within the mind of each hum an being. A num ber of spi ritual teachings tell us to let go of fear and desire. But those spi ritual practices are usua lly unsuc cessf ul. The y haven’t gone to the root of the dysfunc tion. Fear, greed, and desire for power are not the ultimate causa l factors. Trying to becom e a good or better hum an being sounds like a com menda ble and high­ minde d thing to do, yet it is an ende avor you canno t ultimately suc ceed in unl ess there is a shi ft in consc iousne ss. Thi s is because it is still part of the same dysfunc tion, a more subt le and rarefied form of self­enha ncement, of desire for more and a strengt hening of one ’s conc eptual identity, one ’s self­image. You do not becom e good by trying to be good, but by findi ng the goodne ss that is already within you, and allowing that goodne ss to emerge. But it can onl y emerge if som ething funda mental changes in your state of consc iousne ss. The history of Com muni sm , originally inspi red by nobl e ideals, clearly illustrates what happe ns when peopl e attempt to change external reality – create a new earth – without any prior change in their inne r reality, their state of consc iousne ss. The y make plans without taking into account the bl ueprint for dy sfunc tion t hat every hum an be ing c arries w ithin: the ego. TH E A RISING NEW CONSCIOUSNES S Mos t ancient religions and spi ritual traditions sha re the com mon insi ght – that our “nor mal” state of mind is marred by a funda mental defect. However, out of this insi ght into the nature of the hum an condi tion – we may call it the bad news – arises a second insi ght : the good news of the possi bility of a radical transf ormation of hum an consc iousne ss. In Hindu"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"teachings (and som etimes in Buddhi sm also) , this transf ormation is called enlight enm ent. In the teachings of Jesus, it is sal vation, and in Buddhi sm , it is the end of suf fering. Liberation and awakening are other terms use d to describe this transf ormation. The greatest achievement of hum anity is not its works of art, science, or technol ogy , but the recogni tion of its own dysfunc tion, its own madne ss. In the distant past, this recogni tion already came to a few indi vidua ls. A man called Gautama Siddha rtha, who lived 2,600 years ago in Indi a, was perhaps the first who saw it with absol ute clarity. La ter the title Buddha was conf erred upon him. Buddha means “the awakened one .” At abut the same time, another of hum anity’s early awakened teachers emerged in China. His name was La o Tz u. He left a record of his teaching in the form of one of the most pr ofound spi ritual book s e ver written, t he Tao T e Ching. To recogni ze one ’s own insa nity, is of cour se, the arising of sanity, the beginni ng of healing and transc ende nce. A new dimensi on of consc iousne ss had begun to emerge on the planet, a first tentative flowering. Those rare indi vidua ls then spok e to their cont empor aries. The y spok e of sin, of suf fering, of delusi on. The y said, “Look how you live. See what you are doi ng, the suf fering you create.” The y then poi nted to the possi bility of awakening from the collective night mare of “nor mal” hum an existence. The y sho wed t he way. The world was not yet ready for them, and yet they were a vital and necessa ry part of hum an awakening. Inevitably, they were mostly misunde rstood by their cont empor aries, as well as by subse quent generations. The ir teachings, although both simple and powerful, became distorted and misinterpreted, in som e cases even as they were recorded in writing by their disciples. Over the centuries, many things were adde d that had nothing to do with the original teachings, but were reflections of a funda mental misunde rstandi ng. Som e of the teachers were ridiculed, reviled, or killed; others came to be worshi ppe d as gods. Teachings that poi nted the way beyond the dysfunc tion o the hum an mind, the way out of the collective insa nity, w ere di storted a nd be came themselves pa rt of the insa nity. And so religions, to a large extent, became divisive rather than uni fying forces. Instead of bringi ng about an endi ng of violence and hatred through a realization of the funda mental one ness of all life, they brought more violence and hatred, more divisions between peopl e as well as between different religions and even withing the same religion. The y became ideologi es, belief systems peopl e coul d identify with and so use them to"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"enha nce their false sense of self. Thr ough them, they coul d make themselves “right ” and others “wrong” and thus define their identity through their enemies, the “others,” the “nonbe lievers” or “wrong believers” who not infrequently they saw themselves justified in killing. Ma n made “God” in his own image. The eternal, the infinite, and unna meable was reduc ed to a mental idol that you ha d t o be lieve in a nd w orshi p a s “ my god” or “our god. ” And yet... and yet... in spi te of all the insa ne deeds perpetrated in the name of religion, the Truth to which they poi nt still shi nes at their core. It still shi nes, however dimly, through layers upon layers of distortion and misinterpretation. It is unl ikely, however, that you will be able to perceive it there unl ess you have at least already had glimpse of that Truth within your self. Thr oughout history, there have always been rare indi vidua ls who expe rienced a shi ft in consc iousne ss and so realized within themselves that toward which all religions poi nt. To describe that non­ conc eptual Truth, they then use d t he conc eptual framework of their own r eligions. Thr ough som e of those men and wom en, “school s” or movements develope d within all major religions that represented not onl y a rediscovery, but in som e cases an intensi fication of the light of the original teaching. Thi s is how Gnos ticism and mysticism came into existence in early and medieval Christianity, Sufism in the Islamic religion, Hasidism and Kabba la in Juda ism , Advaita Vedanta in Hindui sm , Ze n and Dzogc hen in Buddhi sm . Mos t of these school s were iconoc lastic. The y did away with layers upon layers of deadening conc eptualization and mental belief structures, and for this reason most of them were viewed with suspi cion and often hos tility by the establishe d religious hierarchies. Unlike mainstream religion, their teachings empha sized realization and inne r transf ormation. It is through those esoteric school s or movements that the major religions regained the transf ormative power of the original teachings, although in most cases, onl y a sm all minor ity of peopl e had access to them. The ir num bers were never large enough to have any signi ficant impact on the deep collective unc onsc iousne ss of the majority.

A large­scale ope ning of spi rituality out side of the religious structures is an entirely new developm ent. In the past, this woul d have been inconc eivable, espe cially in the West, the most mind­ dom inated of all cultures, where the Christian chur ch had a virtual franchise on spi rituality.

The next step are thought s of me and mine to designa te things that are som ehow part of “I.” Thi s is identification with obj ects, which means investing things, but ultimately thought s that represent things, with a sense of self, thereby deriving an identity from them.

One time a wom an in her early thirties sat opposi te me. I had seen her before a few times on that train. One coul d not help but notice her. Although the train was full, the seats on either side of her were unoc cupi ed, the reason being, no doubt , that she appe ared to be quite insa ne. She look ed extremely tense and talked to herself incessa ntly in a loud and ang ry voice. She was so absor bed in her thought s that she was totally una ware, in seemed, of other peopl e or her sur roundi ngs. Her head was facing downward and slight ly to the left, as if she were addr essi ng som eone sitting in the empty seat next to her. Although I don ’t remember the precise cont ent, her monol ogue went som ething like this: “And then she said to me... so I said to her you are a liar how dare you accuse me of... when you are the one who has always taken advantage of me I trusted you and you betrayed my trust...” The re was the ang ry tone in her voice of som eone who has been wrong ed, who needs to defend her posi tion lest she becom e anni hilated.

In the case of a child who cries in deep suf fering because his toy has been taken away, the toy represents cont ent. It is interchangeable with any other cont ent, any other toy or obj ect. The cont ent you identify with is condi tione d by your environm ent, your upbr ingi ng, and sur roundi ng culture. Whether the child is rich or poor , whether the toy is a piece of wood sha ped like an animal or a sophi sticated electroni c gadget makes no difference as far as the suf fering cause d by its loss is conc erned. The reason why suc h acute suf fering occurs is conc ealed in the word “my,” and it is structural. The unc onsc ious com pul sion to enha nce one ’s identity through assoc iation with an obj ect is bui lt into t he very s tructure of the egoi c m ind. One of the most basic mind structures through which the ego com es into existence is identification. The word “identification” is derived from the La tin word idem, meaning “same” and facere , which means “to make.” So when I identify with som ething, I “make it the same.” The same as what? The same as I. I endo w it with a sense of self, and so it becom es part of my “identity.” One of the most basic levels of identification is with things: My toy later becom es my car, my house , my clothes, and so on. I try to find myself in things but never quite make it and end up losi ng myself in them.

The y do this, for example, by telling you that you will stand out from the crowd by usi ng this produc t and so by implication be more fully your self. Or they may create an assoc iation in your mind between the produc t and a famous person, or a yout hful, attractive, or happy­looki ng person. Ev en pictures of old or deceased celebrities in their prime work well for that pur pose . The unspok en assum ption is that by buyi ng this produc t, through som e magical act of appr opr iation, you becom e like them, or rather the sur face image of them. And so in many cases you are not buyi ng a produc t but an “identity enha ncer.” Designe r labels are primarily collective identities that you buy into. The y are expe nsi ve and therefore “exclusi ve.” If everybody coul d buy them, they woul d lose their psy chol ogi cal value and all you woul d be left with woul d be their material value, which likely amount s to a fraction of what you pa id. What kind of things you identify with will vary from person to person according to age, gende r, incom e, soc ial class, fashi on, the sur roundi ng culture, and so on. What you identify with is all to do with cont ent; whereas, the unc onsc ious com pul sion to identify is structural. It is one of the most basic ways in w hich t he egoi c m ind ope rates.

Ea ch thing has Beingne ss, is a tempor ary form that has its origin within the formless one Life, the sour ce of all things, all bodi es, all forms.

TH E LO ST R ING When I was se eing pe opl e as a counse lor and spi ritual teacher, I woul d visit a wom an twice a week whose body was riddl ed with cancer.

Som etimes a few words were spok en dur ing those visits, but mostly we woul d sit together in silence, and as we did, she had her first glimpse s of the stillness within herself that she never kne w existed dur ing he r busy l ife as a sc hool teacher. One day, however, I arrived to find her in a state of great distress and anger. “What happe ned” I asked. Her diamond ring, of great mone tary as well as sentimental value, had disappe ared, and she said she was sur e it had been stolen by the wom an who came to look after her for a few hour s every day. She said she didn’t unde rstand how anybody coul d be so callous and heartless as to do this to her. She asked me whether she shoul d conf ront the wom an or whether it woul d be better to call the pol ice immediately. I said I coul dn’t tell her what to do, but asked her to find out how impor tant a rig or anything else was at this poi nt in hr life. “You don ’t unde rstand, ” she said. “Thi s was my grandm other’s ring. I use d to wear it every day unt il I got ill and my hands became too sw ollen. It’s more than just a ring to me. How can I no t b upse t?” The quickne ss of her response and the anger and defensi veness in her voice were indi cations that she had not yet becom e present enough to look within and to disentangle her reaction from the event and obse rve them both. Her anger and defensi veness were signs that the ego was still spe aking through her. I said, “I am goi ng to ask you a few questions, but instead of answ ering them now, see if you can find the answ ers within you. I will pause briefly after each question. When an answ er com es, it may not necessa rily com e in the form of words. ” She said she was ready to listen. I asked: “Do you realize that you will have to let go of the ring at som e poi nt, perhaps quite soon? How m uch m ore time do y ou ne ed be fore you w ill be ready t o l et go of it? Will you becom e less when you let go of it? Has who you are becom e diminishe d by the loss? ” The re were a few minut es of silence after the last question. When she started spe aking again, there was a sm ile on her face, and she seemed at peace. “The last question made me realize som ething impor tant. First I went to my mind for an answ er and my mind said, ‘Yes, f cour se you have been diminishe d.’ The n I asked myself the question again, ‘Has who I am becom e diminishe d?’ Thi s time I tried to feel rather than think the answ er.

I can s till feel it no w, som ething pe aceful but very a live.” “Tha t is the joy of Being, ” I said. “You can onl y feel it when you get out of your head. Being must be felt. It can’t be thought . The ego doe sn’t kno w about it because thought is what it consi sts of. The ring was really in your head as a thought that you conf use d with the sense of I Am. You thought the I Am or a pa rt of it was in t he ring. “Whatever the ego seeks and gets attached to are subs titutes for the Being that it canno t feel. You can value and care for things, but whenever you get attached to them, you will kno w it’s the ego. And you are never really attached to a thing but to a thought that has ‘I,’ ‘me,’ or ‘mine’ in it. Whenever you com pletely accept a loss, you go beyond ego, and who you are, the I Am which i s c onsc iousne ss i tself, emerges.” She said, “Now I unde rstand som ething Jesus said that never made much sense to me before: ‘If som eone takes your shi rt, let him have your coat as w ell.’” “Tha t’s right ,” I said. “It doe sn’t mean you shoul d never lock your door . All it means is that som etimes letting things go is an act of far greater power than de fendi ng or ha ngi ng on. ” In the last few weeks of her life as her body became weaker, she became more and more radiant, as if light were shi ning through her. She gave many of her posse ssi ons away, som e to the wom an she thought had stolen the ring, and with each thing she gave away, her joy deepened. When her mother called me to let me kno w she had passe d away, she also mentione d that after her death they found her ring in the medicine cabinet in the bathroom .

What doe s it mean to make som ething “mine”? If you stand on a street in New York, poi nt to a hug e sky scraper and say, “Tha t bui lding is mine. I own it,” you are either very wealthy or you are delusi ona l or a liar. In any case, you are telling a story in which the thought form “I” and the thought form “bui lding” merge into one . Tha t’s how the mental conc ept of ownershi p works. If everybody agrees with your story, there will be signe d pieces of paper to certify their agreement with it. You are wealthy. If nobody agrees with the story, they will send you to a psy chiatrist. Y ou a re de lusi ona l, or a com pul sive liar. It is impor tant to recogni ze here that the story and the thought forms that make up the story, whether peopl e agree with it or not, have absol utely nothing to do with who you are. Ev en if peopl e agree with it, it is ultimately a fiction. Ma ny peopl e don ’t realize unt il they are on their deathbe d and everything e xternal falls a way t hat no t hing ever ha d a nything t o do w ith w ho they are. In the proximity of death, the whol e conc ept of ownershi p stands revealed as ultimately meaningless. In the last mom ents of their life, they then also realize that while they were looki ng throughout their lives for a more com plete sense of self, what they were really looki ng for, their Being, had actually always already been there, but had been largely obsc ured by their identification with things, which ultimately means identification with their m ind. “Blesse d are the poor in spi rit,” Jesus said, “for theirs will be the kingdom of heaven.” 1 What doe s “poor in spi rit” mean? No inne r baggage, no identifications. Not with things, nor with any mental conc epts that have a sense of self in them. And what is the “kingdom of heaven” The simple but profound joy of Being that is there when you let og of identifications and so becom e “poor in spi rit.”"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Thi s is why renounc ing all posse ssi ons has been an ancient spi ritual practice in both Ea st and West. Renunc iation of posse ssi ons, however, will not autom atically free you of the ego.

The re are peopl e who have renounc ed all posse ssi ons but have a bigger ego than som e milliona ires. If you take away one kind of identification, the ego will quickly find another. It ultimately doe sn’t mind what it identifies with as long as it has an identity. Anti­consum erism or anti­private ownershi p woul d be another thought form, another mental posi tion, that can replace identification with posse ssi ons. Thr ough it you coul d make your self right and others wrong. As we sha ll see later, making your self right and others wrong is one of the principal egoi c mind pa tterns, one of the m ain f orms of unc onsc iousne ss. I n o ther words, t he cont ent of the ego may change; the mind structure that keeps it alive doe s not. One of the unc onsc ious assum ptions is that by identifying with an obj ect through the fiction of ownershi p, the appa rent sol idity and permanency of that material obj ect will endo w your sense of self with greater sol idity and permanency. Thi s appl ies particularly to bui ldings and even more so to land since it is the onl y thing you think you can own that canno t be destroyed. The absur dity of owning som ething becom es even more appa rent in the case of land. In the days of the white settlement, the natives of North America found ownershi p of land an incom prehensi ble conc ept. And so they lost it when the Eur ope ans made them signs pieces of paper that were equally incom prehensi ble to them. The y felt they belong ed to the land, but the land di d no t be long t o t hem. The ego tends to equate having with Being: I have, therefore I am. And the more I have, the more I am. The ego lives through com parison. How you are seen by others turns into how you see your self. If everyone lived in a mansi on or everyone was wealthy, your mansi on or your wealth woul d no long er serve to enha nce your sense of self. You coul d then move to a simple cabin, give up our wealth, and regain an identity by seeing your self and being seen as more spi ritual than others. How you are seen by others becom es the mirror that tells you what you are like and who you are. The ego’s sense of self­worth is in most cases bound up with the worth you have"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"in the eyes of others. You need others to give you a sense of self, and if you live in a culture that to a large extent equates self­worth with how much and what you have, if you canno t look through this collective delusi on, you will be conde mned to chasing after things for the rest of your life in the vain hope of findi ng y our worth a nd c om pletion of your se nse of se lf there. How do you let go of attachm ent to things? Don’t even try. It’s impossi ble. Attachm ent to things drops away by itself when you no long er seek to find your self in them. In the meantime, just be aware of your attachm ent to things. Som etimes you may not kno w that you are attached to som ething, which is to say, unt il you lose it or there is the threat of loss. If you then becom e upse t, anxi ous, and so on, it means you are attached. If you are aware that you are identified with a thing, the identification is no long er total. “I am the awareness that is aware that there is attachm ent.” Tha t’s the beginni ng of the transf ormation of consc iousne ss. WANTING: TH E N EED FOR MO RE The ego identifies with having, but its satisfaction in having is a relatively sha llow and shor t­lived one . Conc ealed within it remains a deep­ seated sense of dissa tisfaction, of incom pleteness, of “not enough. ” “I don' t have enough y et,” by w hich t he ego r eally m eans, “ I am not enough y et.” As we have seen, hav ing – the conc ept of ownershi p – is a fiction created by the ego to give itself sol idity and permanency and make itself stand out , make itself spe cial. Since you canno t find your self through having, however, there is another more powerful drive unde rneath it that pertains to the structure of the ego: the need for more, which we coul d also call “wanting. ” No ego can last for long without the need for more. The refore, wanting keeps the ego alive much more than having. The ego wants to want more than it wants to have. And so the sha llow satisfaction of having is always replaced by more wanting. Thi s is the psy chol ogi cal need for more, that is to say, more things to identify with. It is an addi ctive need, not an authentic one . In som e cases, the psy chol ogi cal need for more or the feeling of not enough that is so characteristic of the ego becom es transf erred to the physical level and so turns into insa tiable hung er. The suf ferers of bul imia will often make themselves vom it so they can cont inue eating. The ir mind is"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"hung ry, not their body . Thi s eating disor der woul d becom e healed if the suf ferers, instead of being identified with their mind, coul d get in touc h with their body and so feel the true needs of the body rather than the pse udo­ needs of the egoi c m ind. Som e egos kno w what they want and pur sue their aim with grim and ruthless determination – Genghi s Khan, Stalin, Hitler, to give just a few larger­than­life examples. The energy behind their wanting, however, creates an opposi ng energy of equal intensi ty that in the end leads to their downfall. in the meantime, they make themselves and many others unha ppy, or, in the larger­than­life examples, create hell on earth. Mos t egos have conf licting wants. The y want different things at different times or may not even kno w what they want except that they don' t want what is: the present mom ent. Unease, restlessne ss, bor edom , anxi ety, dissa tisfaction , are the resul t of unf ulfilled wanting. Wanting is structural, so no amount of cont ent can provide lasting fulfillment as long as that mental structure remains in place. Intense wanting that has no spe cific obj ect can often be found in the still­ developi ng ego of teenagers, som e of whom are in a permanent state of negativity a nd di ssa tisfaction. The physical needs for food, water, she lter, clothing, and basic com forts coul d be easily met for all hum ans on the planet, were it not for the imbalance of resour ces created by the insa ne and rapacious need for more, the greed of the ego. It finds collective expr essi on in the econom ic structures of this world, suc h as the hug e corpor ations, which are egoi c entities that com pete with each other for more. The ir onl y blind aim is profit. The y pur sue that aim with absol ute ruthlessne ss.

IDEN TIFICATION W ITH TH E B ODY Apart from obj ects, another basic form of identification is with “my” body . Firstly, the body is male or female, and so the sense of being a man or wom an takes up a signi ficant part of most peopl e's sense of self. Gende r becom es identity. Identification with gende r is encour aged at an early age, and it forces you into a role, into condi tione d patterns of behavior that affect all aspe cts of your life, not just sexua lity. It is a role many peopl e becom e com pletely trappe d in, even more so in som e of the traditiona l soc ieties than in Western culture where identification with gende r is beginni ng to lesse n som ewhat. In som e traditiona l cultures, the worst fate a wom an can have is to be unwed or barren, and for a man to lack sexua l potency and not be able to produc e children. Life's fulfillment is perceived to be fulfillment of one 's gende r identity. In the West, it is the physical appe arance of the body that cont ribut es greatly to the sense of who you think you are: its strengt h or weakne ss, its perceived beauty or ugliness relative to others. For many peopl e, their sense of self­worth is intimately bound up with their physical strengt h, good look s, fitness, and external appe arance. many feel a diminishe d sense of self­worth because they pe rceive their body a s ug ly or imperfect. In som e cases, the mental image or conc ept of “my body” is a com plete distortion of reality. A young wom an may think of herself as overweight and therefore starve herself when in fact she is quite thin. She canno t see her body anym ore. All she “sees” is the mental conc ept of her body , which says “I am fat” or “I will becom e fat.” At the root of this condi tion lies identification with the mind. As peopl e have becom e more and more mind­ identified, which is the intensi fication of egoi c dysfunc tion, there has also been a dramatic increase in the incidence of anor exia in recent decades. If the suf ferer coul d look at her body without the interfering judgm ents of her mind or even recogni ze those judgm ents for what they are instead of believing in them – or better still, if she coul d feel her body from within – t his w oul d i nitiate he r he aling."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Those who are identified with their good look s, physical strengt h, or abilities expe rience suf fering when those attribut es begin to fade and disappe ar, as of cour se they will. The ir very identity that was based on them is then threatened with collapse . In either case, ugly or beautiful, peopl e derive a signi ficant part of their identity, be it negative or posi tive, from their body . To be more precise, they derive their identity from the I­thought that they errone ousl y attach to the mental image or conc ept of their body , which after all is no more than a physical form that sha res the destiny of all forms­ impermanence and ul timately de cay. Eq uating the physical sense ­perceived body that is destined to grow old, wither, and die with “I” always leads to suf fering soone r or later. To refrain from identifying with the body doe sn' t mean that you neglect, despi se, or no long er care for it. If it is strong, beautiful, or vigor ous, you can enjoy and appr eciate those attribut es – while they last. You can also improve the body' s condi tion through right nut rition and exercise. If you don' t' equate the body w ith w ho y ou a re, w hen be auty f ades, vi gor di minishe s, or the body becom es incapacitated, this will not affect your sense of worth or identity in any way.

It is not just peopl e with good or near­perfect bodi es who are likely to equate it with who they are. You can just as easily identify with a “probl ematic” body and make the body' s imperfection, illness, or disability in to your identity. You may then think and spe ak of your self as a “suf ferer” of this or that chroni c illness or disability. You receive a great deal of attention from doc tors and others who cons tantly conf irm to you your conc eptual identity as a suf ferer or a patient. You then unc onsc iousl y cling to the illness because it has becom e the most impor tant part of who you perceive your self to be.

If you are not familiar with “inne r body” awareness, close your eyes for a mom ent and find out if there is life insi de your hands. Don' t ask your mind. It will say, “ I can't feel anything. ” Proba bly it will also say, “Give me som ething more interesting to think about .” So instead of aski ng your mind, go to the hands directly.

Thi s is forgetfulness of Being, the primary error, the illusi on of absol ute se parateness t hat turns r eality i nto a ni ght mare. FROM D ES CARTES 'S ER ROR TO SARTR E'S INSIGHT The seventeenth­century phi losophe r Descartes, regarded as the founde r of mode rn phi losoph y, gave expr essi on to this primary error with his famous dictum (which he saw as primary truth): “I think , therefore I am.” Thi s was the answ er he found to the question “Is there anything I can kno w with absol ute certainty?” He realized that the fact that he was always thinki ng was beyond doubt , and so he equated thinki ng with Being, that is to say, identity – I am – with thinki ng. Instead of the ultimate truth, he had found t he root of the ego, but he di dn' t kno w that. It took almost three hundr ed years before another famous phi losophe r saw som ething in that statement that Descartes, as well as everybody else, had overlook ed. His name was Jean­Paul Sartre. He look ed at Descartes's statement “I think , therefore I am” very deeply and sudde nly realized, in his own words, “The consc iousne ss that says 'I am' is not the consc iousne ss that thinks.” What did he mean by that? When you are aware that you are thinki ng, that awareness is not part of thinki ng. It is a different dimensi on of consc iousne ss. And it is that awareness that says “I am.” If there were nothing but thought in you, you woul dn' t even kno w you are thinki ng. You woul d be like a dreamer who doe sn' t kno w he is dreaming. You woul d be as"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"identified with every thought as the dreamer is with every image in the dream. Ma ny peopl e still live like that, like sleepw alkers, trappe d in old dysfunc tiona l mind­ sets that cont inuousl y re­create the same night marish reality. When you kno w you are dreaming, you are awake within the dream. Another di mensi on of consc iousne ss ha s c om e in. The implication of Sartre's insi ght is profound, but he himself was still too identified with thinki ng to realize the full signi ficance of what he had discovered: an e merging ne w di mensi on of consc iousne ss. TH E P EA CE TH AT P ASSES ALL U NDER STANDING The re are many account s of peopl e who expe rienced that emerging new dimensi on of consc iousne ss as a resul t of tragic loss at som e poi nt in their lives. Som e lost all of their posse ssi ons, others their children or spouse , their soc ial posi tion, reput ation, or physical abilities. In som e cases, through disaster or war, they lost all of these simultaneousl y and found themselves with “nothing. ” We may call this a limit­situation. Whatever they had identified with, whatever gave them their sense of self, had been taken away. The n sudde nly and inexpl icably, the angui sh or intense fear they initially felt gave way to a scared sense of Presence, a deep peace and serenity and com plete freedom from fear. Thi s phe nom enon must have been familiar to St. Paul, who use d the expr essi on “the peace of God which passe th all unde rstandi ng. ” 2 It is inde ed a peace that doe sn' t seem to make sense , and the peopl e who expe rienced it asked themselves: In the face of this , how can it be that I feel suc h pe ace? The answ er is simple, onc e you realize what the ego is and how it works. When forms that you had identified with, that gave you your sense of self, collapse or are taken away, it can lead to a collapse of the ego, since ego is identification with form. When there is nothing to identify with anym ore, who are you? When forms around you die or death appr oaches, your sense of Beingne ss, of I Am, is freed from its entanglement with form: Spirit is released from its imprisonm ent in matter. You realize your esse ntial identity as formless, as an all­pervasive Presence, of Being prior to all forms, all identifications. You realize your true identity as consc iousne ss itself, rather than what consc iousne ss had identified with. Tha t's the peace of God.

Thi s thought form and the emotions it creates, suc h as anger, resentment, self­pity, and so on, they strong ly identify with, and it immediately takes the place of all the other identifications that have collapse d through the loss. In other words, the ego quickly finds a new form. The fact that this new form is a deeply unha ppy one doe sn' t conc ern the ego too much, as long as it has an identity, good or bad. In fact, this new ego will be more cont racted, more rigid a nd i mpenetrable than t he ol d one . Whenever tragic loss occurs, you either resist or you yield.

As long as you are com pletely una ware of this you take the thinker to be who you are. Thi s is the egoi c mind. We call it egoi c because there is a sense of self, of I (ego) , in every thought – every memory, every interpretation, opi nion, viewpoi nt, reaction, emotion. Thi s is unc onsc iousne ss, spi ritually spe aking. Your thinki ng, the cont ent of your mind, is of cour se condi tione d by the past: your upbr ingi ng, culture, family background, and so on. The central core of all your mind activity consi sts of certain repetitive and persistent thought s, emotions, and reactive patterns that you i dentify w ith m ost strong ly. Thi s e ntity i s the ego i tself. In most cases, when you say “I,” it is the ego spe aking, not you, as we have seen. It consi sts of thought and emotion, of a bundl e of memories you identify with as “me and my story,” of habitual roles you play without kno wing it, of collective identifications suc h as nationa lity, religion, race, soc ial class, or pol itical allegiance. It also cont ains persona l identifications, not onl y with posse ssi ons, but also with opi nions, external appe arance, long­ standi ng resentments, or conc epts of your self as better than or not as good as others, a s a suc cess or failure. The cont ent of the ego varies from person to person, bu in every ego the same structure ope rates. In other words: Egos onl y differ on the sur face. Deep down they are all the same. In what way are they the same? The y live on identification and separation. When you live through the mind­ made self com prised of thought and emotion that is the ego, the basis for your identity is precarious because thought and emotion are by their very nature ephe meral, fleeting. So every ego is cont inuousl y strugg ling for sur vival, trying to protect and enlarge itself. To uphol d the I­thought , it needs the opposi te thought of “the other.” The conc eptual “I” canno t sur vive without the conc eptual “other.” The others are most other when I see them as my enemies. At one end of this scale of this unc onsc ious egoi c pattern lies the egoi c com pul sive habit of faultfindi ng and com plaining about others. Jesus referred to it when he said, “Why to do you see the spe ck that is in your"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?” 1 At the other end of the scale, there is physical violence between indi vidua ls and warfare between nations. In the Bible, Jesus' question remains una nsw ered, but the answ er is, of cour se: Because when I criticize or conde mn another, it makes me feel bi gger, supe rior. COMP LA INING AND RES EN TMEN T Com plaining is one of the ego' s favorite strategies for strengt hening itself. Ev ery com plaint is a little story the mind makes up that you com pletely believe in. Whether you com plain aloud or onl y in thought makes no difference. Som e egos that perhaps don' t have much else to identify with easily sur vive on com plaining alone . When you are in the grip of suc h and ego, com plaining, espe cially about other peopl e, is habitual and, of cour se, unc onsc ious, which means you don' t kno w what you are doi ng. Appl ying negative mental labels to peopl e, either to their face or more com monl y when you spe ak about them to others or even just think about them, is often part of this pattern. Name­calling is the crude st form of suc h labeling and of the ego' s need to be right and trium ph over others: “jerk, bastard, bitch” ­ all definitive pronounc ements that you can't argue with. On the next level down on the scale of unc onsc iousne ss, you have shout ing and screaming, and not much be low that, ph ysical vi olence. Resentment is the emotion that goe s with com plaining and the mental labeling of peopl e and adds even more energy to the ego. Resentment means to feel bitter, indi gna nt, agg rieved, or offende d. You resent other peopl e's greed, their dishone sty, their lack of integrity, what they are doi ng what they did in the past, what they said what they failed to do, what they shoul d for shoul dn' t have done . The ego loves it. Instead of overlooki ng unc onsc iousne ss in others, you make it in to their identity. Who is doi ng that? The unc onsc iousne ss in you, the ego. Som etimes the “fault” that you perceive in another isn' t even there. It is a total misinterpretation, a projection by a mind condi tione d to see enemies and to make itself right or supe rior. At other times, the fault may be theirs, but by focusi ng on it, som etimes to the exclusi on of everything else, you amplify it. And what you react to i n a nother, you s trengt hen i n y our self."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Non­ reaction to the ego in others is one of the most effective ways not onl y of goi ng beyond ego in your self but also of dissol ving the collective hum an ego. But you can onl y be in a state of nonr eaction if you can recogni ze som eone 's behavior as com ing from the ego, as being an expr essi on of the collective hum an dysfunc tion. When you realize it's not persona l, there is no long er a com pul sion to react as if it were. By not reacting to the ego, you will often be able to bring out the sanity in others, which is the unc ondi tione d consc iousne ss as oppose d to the condi tione d. At times you may have to take practical steps to protect your self from deeply unc onsc ious peopl e. Thi s you can do without making them into enemies. Your greatest protection, however, is being consc ious. Som ebody becom es an enemy if you persona lize the unc onsc iousne ss that is the ego. Non reaction is not weakne ss but strengt h. Another word for nonr eaction is forgiveness. To forgive is to overlook , or rather to look through. You look through the ego to the sanity that is in every hum an being as his or her esse nce. The ego loves to com plain and feel resentful not onl y abut other peopl e but also about situations. What you can do to a person, you can also do to a situation: make it into an enemy. The implication is always: Thi s shoul d not be happe ning; I don' t want to be here; I don' t want to be doi ng this; I'm being treated unf airly. And the egos greatest enemy of all is, of cour se, the pr esent m om ent, w hich i s to sa y, life itself. Com plaining is not to be conf use d with informing som eone of a mistake or deficiency so that it can be put right . And to refrain from com plaining doe sn' t necessa rily mean put ting up with bad quality or behavior. The re is no ego in telling the waiter that your soup is cold and needs to be heated up – if you stick to the facts, which are always neutral. “How dare you serve me cold soup... ” Tha t's com plaining. The re is a “me” here that loves to feel persona lly offende d by the cold soup and is goi ng to make the most of it, a “me” that enjoys making som eone wrong. The com plaining we are talking about is in the service of the ego, not of change. Som etimes it becom es obvious that the ego doe sn' t really want change so that it can go on c om plaining. See if you can catch, that is to say, notice, the voice in the head, perhaps in the very mom ent it com plains about som ething, and recogni ze it for what it is: the voice of the ego, no more than a condi tione d mind­ pattern,"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"a thought . Whenever you notice that voice, you will also realize that you are not the voice, but the one who is aware of it. In fact, you are the awareness that is aware of the voice. In the background, there is the awareness. In the foreground, there is the voice, the thinker. In this way you are becom ing free of the ego, free of the unobse rved mind. The mom ent you becom e aware of the ego in you, it is strictly spe aking no long er the ego, but just an old, condi tione d mind­ pattern. Ego implies una wareness. Awareness and ego canno t coexist. The old mind­ pattern or mental habit may still sur vive and reoccur for a while because it has the mom entum of thousa nds of years of collective hum an unc onsc iousne ss behind it, but every time it is recogni zed, it is w eakened. REA CTIVITY AND GRIEV ANCES Whereas resentment is often the emotion that goe s with com plaining, it may also be accom panied by a strong er emotion suc h as anger or som e other form of upse t. In this way, it becom es more highl y charged energetically. Com plaining then turns into reactivity, another of the ego' s ways of strengt hening itself. The re are many peopl e who are always waiting for the next thing to react against, to feel anno yed or disturbed about – and it never takes long before they find it. “Thi s is an out rage,” they say. “How dare you... ” “ I resent this.” The y are addi cted to upse t and anger as others are to a drug. Thr ough reacting against this or that they asse rt and strengt hen their feeling of se lf. A long­ standi ng resentment is called a grievance. To carry a grievance is to be in a permanent state of “against,” and that is why grievances cons titute a signi ficant part of many peopl e's ego. Collective grievances can sur vive for centuries in the psy che of a nation or tribe and fuel a never­ endi ng c ycle of vi olence. A grievance is a strong negative emotion conne cted to an event in the som etimes distant past that is being kept alive by com pul sive thinki ng, by retelling the story in the head or out loud of “what som eone did to me” or “ what som eone did to us. ” A grievance will also cont aminate other areas of your life.

One strong grievance is enough to cont aminate large areas of your life and k eep y ou i n t he grip of the ego.

Don' t try to let go of the grievance. Trying to let go, to forgive, doe s not work. Forgiveness happe ns naturally when you see that it has no pur pose other than to strengt hen a false sense of self, to keep the ego in place. The seeing is freeing. Jesus' teaching to “Forgive your enemies” is esse ntially about the undoi ng of one of the m ain e goi c structures in t he hum an m ind. The past has no power to stop you from being present now. Only your grievance about the past can do that. And what is a grievance? The baggage of ol d t hought and e motion. BEING RIGHT, MA KING W RONG Com plaining as well as faultfindi ng and reactivity strengt hen the ego' s sense of bounda ry and separateness on which tis sur vival depends. But they also strengt hen the ego in another way by giving it a feeling of supe riority on which it thrives. It may not be immediately appa rent how com plaining, say, about a traffic jam, about pol iticians, about the “greedy wealthy” or the “lazy une mployed,” or your colleague s or ex­spouse , men or wom en, can give you a sense of supe riority. Here is why. When you com plain, by implication you are right and the person or situation you com plain about or react against is w rong. The re is nothing that strengt hens the ego more than being right . Being right is identification with a mental posi tion – a perspe ctive, an opi nion, a judgm ent, a story. For you to be right , of cour se, you need som eone else to be wrong, and so the ego loves to make wrong in order to be right . In other words: you need to make others wrong in order to get a strong er sense of who you are. Not onl y a person, but also a situation can be made wrong through com plaining and reactivity, which always implies that “this shoul d not be happe ning. ” Being right places you in a posi tion of imagined moral"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"supe riority in relation to the person or situation that is being judg ed and found wanting. It is that sense of supe riority the ego craves and through which i t enha nces itself. IN DEF EN CE O F AN ILL USION Facts undoubt edly exist. If you say: “Light travels faster than sound, ” and som eone else says the opposi te is the case, you are obviousl y right , and he is wrong. The simple obse rvation that light ning precedes thunde r coul d conf irm this. So not onl y are you right , but you kno w you are right . Is there any ego involved in this? Possi bly, but not necessa rily. If you are simply stating what you kno w to be true, the ego is not involved at all, because there is no identification. Identification with what? With mind and a mental posi tion. Such identification, however, can easily creep in. If you find your self saying, “Believe me, I kno w” or “Why do you never believe me?” then the ego has already crept in. It is hiding in the little word “me.” A simple statement: “Light is faster than sound, ” although true, is now in service of illusi on, of ego. It has becom e cont aminated with a false sense of “I”; it has becom e persona lized, turned into a mental posi tion. The “I” feels diminishe d or of fende d be cause som ebody doe sn' t be lieve what “I” sa id. Ego takes everything persona lly. Em otion arises, defensi veness, perhaps even agg ressi on. Are you defendi ng the truth? No, the truth, in any case, needs no defense . The light or sound doe s not care about what you or anybody else think s. You are defendi ng your self, or rather the illusi on of your self, the mind­ made subs titute. It woul d be even more accurate to say that the illusi on is defendi ng itself. If even the simple and straight forward realm of facts can lend itself to egoi c distortion and illusi on, how much more so the less tangi ble realm of opi nions, viewpoi nts, and judgm ents, all of them thought forms that can e asily be com e infuse d w ith a se nse of “I.” Ev ery ego conf use s opi nions and viewpoi nts with facts. Furthermore, it canno t tell the differences between an event and its reaction to that event. Ev ery ego is a master of selective perception and distorted interpretation. Only through awareness – not through thinki ng – can you differentiate between fact and opi nion. Only through awareness are you able to see: The re is the situation and here is the anger I feel about it, and then realize there are other ways of appr oaching the situation, other ways of seeing it and dealing"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"with it.

But if the belief “I am right ; you are wrong” is one of the ways in which the ego strengt hens itself, if making your self right and others wrong is a mental dysfunc tion that perpetuates separation and conf lict between hum an beings, doe s that mean there is no suc h thing as right or wrong behavior, action, or belief? And woul dn' t that be the moral relativism that som e cont empor ary C hristian t eachings se e as the great evil of our times? The history of Christianity is, of cour se, a prime example of how the belief that you are in sol e posse ssi on of the truth, that is to say, right , can corrupt your actions and behavior to the poi nt of insa nity. For centuries, torturing and bur ning peopl e alive if their opi nion diverged even in the slight est from Chur ch doc trine or narrow interpretations of scripture (the “Truth”) was consi dered right because the victims were “wrong. ” The y were so wrong that they needed to be killed. The Truth was consi dered more impor tant than hum an life. And what was the Truth? A story you had to believe in; which m eans, a bundl e of thought s. The one million peopl e that mad dictator Pol Pot of Cambodi a ordered killed include d everybody who wore glasse s. Why? To him, the Ma rxist interpretation of history was the absol ute truth, and according to his version of it, those who w ore glasse s be long ed t o t he educ ated g lass, t he bour geoisie, the expl oiters of the peasants. The y needed to be eliminated to make room for a ne w soc ial or der. H is truth a lso w as a bundl e of thought s. The Cathol ic and other chur ches are actually correct when they identify relativism , the belief that there is no absol ute truth to gui de hum an behavior, as one of the evils of our times; but you won' t find absol ute truth if you look for it where it canno t be found: in doc trines, ideologi es, sets of rules, or stories. What do all of these have in com mon? The y are made up of thought . Thought can a t be st poi nt to t he truth, but it ne ver is the truth.

The Truth is inse parable from who you are. Yes, you are the truth. If you look for it elsewhere, you will be deceived every time. The very Being that you are is Truth.

If misinterpreted, however, they becom e a great obs tacle. Jesus spe aks of the inne rmost I Am, the esse nce identity of every man and wom an, every life­ form, in fact. He spe aks of the life that you are. Som e Christian mystics have called it the Christ within; Buddhi sts call it your Buddha nature; for Hindus, it is Atman, the indw elling God.

Both sides of the conf lict are equally identified with"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"their own perspe ctive, their own “story,” that is to say, identified with thought .

Both sides believe themselves to be in posse ssi on of the truth. Both regard themselves as victims and the “other” as evil, and because they have conc eptualized and thereby dehum anized the other as the enemy, they can kill and inflict all kinds of violence on the other, even on children, without feeling their hum anity and suf fering. The y becom e trappe d in an insa ne spi ral of perpetration a nd r etribut ion, a ction a nd r eaction. Here it becom es obvious that the hum an ego in its collective aspe ct as “us” against “them” is even more insa ne that n the “me,” the indi vidua l ego, although the mechanism is the same. By far the greater part of violence that hum ans have inflicted on each other is not the work of criminals or the mentally derange, but of nor mal, respe ctable citizens in the service of the collective ego.

Greed, selfishne ss, expl oitation, cruelty, and violence are still all­ pervasive on this planet.

You cons truct a conc eptual identity for an indi vidua l or group, and you say: “Thi s is who he is. Thi s is who they are.” When you conf use the ego that you perceive in others with their identity, it is the work of your own ego that use s this mispe rception to strengt hen itself through being right and therefore supe rior, and through reacting with conde mnation, indi gna tion, and often anger against the perceived enemy. All this is enor mousl y satisfying to the ego.

WAR IS A MI ND­SET In certain cases, you may need to protect your self or som eone else from being harmed by another, but beware of making it your missi on to “eradicate evil,” as you are likely to turn into the very thing you are fight ing against.

If som eone has more, kno ws more, or can do more than I, the ego feels threatened because the feeling of “less” diminishe s its imagined sense of self relative to the other.

Usua lly peopl e are com pletely una ware of the roles they play. The y are those roles. Som e roles are subt le; others are blatantly obvious, except to the person playing it. Som e roles are designe d simply to get attention from others. The ego thrives on others' attention, which is after all a form of psy chic energy. The ego doe sn' t kno w that the sour ce of all energy is within you, so it seeks it out side. It is not the formless attention which is Presence that the ego seeks, but attention in som e form , suc h as recogni tion, praise, adm iration, or just to be noticed in som e way, to have its e xistence ackno wledged. A shy person who is afraid of the attention of others is not free of ego, but has an ambivalent ego that both wants and fears attention from others. The fear is that the attention may take the form of disappr oval or criticism , that is to say, som ething that diminishe s the sense of self rather than enha nces it. So the shy person' s fear of attention is greater than his or her need of attention. Shyne ss often goe s with a self­conc ept that is predom inantly negative, the belief of being inadequate.

Such pathol ogi cal forms of ego are onl y more extreme versions of nor mal egos. A very com mon role is the one of victim, and the form of attention it seeks is sym pathy or pity or others' interest in my probl ems, “me and my story.” Seeing one self as a victim is an element in many egoi c patterns, suc h as com plaining, being offende d, out raged, and so on. Of cour se, onc e I am identified with a story in which I assi gne d myself the role of victim, I don' t want it to end, and so, as every therapist kno ws, the ego doe s not want an end to its “probl ems” because they are part of its identity. If no one will listen to my sad story, I can tell it to myself in my head, over and over, and feel sor ry for myself, sand so have an identity as som eone who is being treated unf airly by life or other peopl e, fate or God.

When you play roles, you are unc onsc ious. When you catch your self playing a role, that recogni tion creates a spa ce between you and the role. It is the beginni ng of freedom from the role. When you are com pletely identified with a role, you conf use a pattern of behavior with who you are, and you take your self very seriousl y. You also autom atically assi gn roles to others that correspondi ng to your s.

Whereas in the 1950s, most Americans were still extremely conf ormist in thought and behavior, in the 1960s, millions of peopl e began to withdr aw their identification with a collective conc eptual identity because the insa nity of the collective was so obvious.

The all­impor tant question is: Are you able to fulfill the func tion of being a parent, and fulfill it well, without identifying with that func tion, that is, without it becom ing a role? Part of the necessa ry func tion of being a parent is looki ng after the needs of the child, preventing the child from getting into danger, and at times telling the child what to do and not to do. When being a parent becom es an identity, however, when your sense of self is entirely or largely derived from it, the func tion easily becom es overempha sized, exaggerated, and takes you over. Giving children what they need becom es excessi ve and turns into spoi ling; preventing them from getting into danger becom es overprotectiveness and interferes with their need to expl ore the world and try things out for themselves.

Formless attention is inse parable from the dimensi on of Being. H ow doe s it work?

Although the word is nor mally use d to describe a condi tion of disease, it is derived from pat hos, which means suf fering.

It is the inne r equivalent of the environm ental pol lution of our planet. Negative states, suc h as anger, anxi ety, hatred, resentment, discont ent, envy, jealousy , and so on, are not recogni zed as negative but as totally justified and are further mispe rceived not as self­created but as cause d by som eone else or som e external factor. “I am hol ding you responsi ble for my pain.” Thi s is what by implication t he ego i s sa ying. The ego canno t distingui sh between a situation and its interpretation of and reaction to that situation. You might say, “What a dreadful day,” without realizing that the cold, the wind, and the rain or whatever condi tion you react to are not dreadful. The y are as they are. What is dreadful is your reaction, your inne r resistance to it, and the emotion that is created by Tha t resistance.

The mental illness that is called paranoi d schizophr enia, or paranoi a for shor t, is esse ntially an exaggerated form of ego. It usua lly consi sts of a fictitious story the mind has invented to make sense of a persistent unde rlying feeling of fear. The main element of the story is the belief that certain peopl e (som etimes large num bers or almost everyone ) are plotting against me, or are conspi ring to cont rol or kill me. The story often has an inne r consi stency and logi c so that it som etimes fool s others into believing it too. Som etimes organizations or entire nations have paranoi d belief systems at their very basis. The ego' s fear and distrust of other peopl e, its tende ncy to empha size the “otherness” of others by focusi ng on their perceived faults and make those faults into their identity, is taken a little further and makes others into inhum an mons ters. The ego needs others, but its dilemma is that deep down it hates and fears them. Jean­Paul Sartre's statement “Hell is other peopl e” is the voice of the ego. The person suf fering from paranoi a expe riences that hell most acutely, but everyone in whom the egoi c patterns still ope rate will feel it to som e degree. The strong er the ego in you, the more likely it is that in your perception other peopl e are the main sour ce of probl ems in your life.

The mental illness we call paranoi a also manifests another sym ptom that is an element of every ego, although in paranoi a it takes on a more extreme form. The more the suf ferer sees himself persecuted, spi ed on, or threatened by others, the more pronounc ed becom es his sense of being the center of the uni verse around whom everything revolves, and the more spe cial and impor tant he feels as the imagined focal poi nt of so many peopl e's attention.

It gives tempor ary cohe sion to the atom s and molecules that make up your physical organism . It is the organizing principle behind the workings of all the organs of the body , the conversion of oxygen and food into energy, the heartbeat and circulation of he blood, the immune system that protects the body from invaders, the transl ation of sensor y input into nerve impul ses that are sent to the brain, decode d there, and reasse mbled into a cohe rent inne r picture of out er reality.

It is the same intelligence that manifests a s G aia, the com plex l iving be ing t hat is pl anet earth. Thi s intelligence gives rise to instinctive reactions of the organism to any threat or challenge.

In certain situations, hum an beings expe rience instinctive response s in the same way that animals do.

Primordial fear. When being cornered, a sudde n flare­up of intense energy gives strengt h to the body that it didn' t have before. Primordial anger. The se instinctive response s appe ar akin to emotions, but are not emotions in the true sense of the word. The funda mental difference between an instinctive response and an emotion is this: An instinctive response response is the body' s direct response to som e external situation. An emotion, on the other hand, is the body' s response to a thought . Indi rectly, an emotion can also be a response to an actual situation tor event, but it will be a response to t he event se en t hrough t he filter of a m ental interpretation, the filter of thought , that is to say, through the mental conc epts of good and bad, like and dislike, me and mine.

It is amazing ho w m uch e motion a little m ental conc ept like “my” can g enerate. Al though the body is very intelligent, it canno t tell the difference between an actual situation and a thought .

We have already seen what kind of thinki ng the egoi c voice engages in most of the time and the dysfunc tion inhe rent in the structure of its thought processe s, regardless of cont ent. Thi s dysfunc tiona l thinki ng is what the body r eacts to w ith ne gative emotion. The voice in the head tells a story that the body believes in and reacts to. Those reactions are the emotions. The emotions, in turn, feed energy back to the thought s that created the emotion in the first place. Thi s is the vicious circle between une xamined thought s and emotions, giving rise to emotiona l thinki ng a nd e motiona l story­making. The emotiona l com pone nt of ego differs from person to person. in som e egos, it is greater than in others. Thought s that trigger emotiona l response s in the body may som etimes com e so fast that before the mind has had time to voice them, the body has already responde d with an emotion, and the emotion has turned into a reaction. Those thought s exist at a pre­ verbal stage and coul d be called unspok en, unc onsc ious assum ptions. The y have their origin in a person' s past condi tioni ng, usua lly from early childhood. “Peopl e canno t be trusted” woul d be an example of suc h an unc onsc ious assum ption in a person whose primordial relationshi ps, that is to say, with parents roe siblings, were not suppor tive and did not inspi re trust.

Almost every hum an body is unde r a great deal of strain and stress, not because it is threatened by som e external factor but from within the mind.

Fear, anxi ety, anger, bearing a grudg e, sadne ss, hatred or intense dislike, jealousy , envy – all disrupt the energy flow through the body , affect the heart, the immune system, digestion, produc tion of hor mone s, and so on.

Like all life­forms, it periodi cally needs to feed – to take in new energy – and the food it requires to replenish itself consi sts of energy that is com patible with its own, which is to say, energy that vibrates at a similar frequency.

The pain­body that is ready to feed can use the most insi gni ficant event as a trigger, som ething som ebody says or doe s, or even a thought . If you live alone or there is nobody around at the time, the pain­body will feed on your thought s. Sudde nly, your thinki ng becom es deeply negative. You were most likely una ware that just prior to the influx of negative thinki ng a wave of emotion invaded your mind – as a dark and heavy mood, as anxi ety or fiery anger.

However, in the greater scheme of things, hum an beings are meant to evolve into consc ious beings, and those who don' t will suf fer the conse quences of their unc onsc iousne ss. The y are out of alignm ent with the evolutiona ry i mpul se of the uni verse. And even that is onl y relatively true. From a highe r perspe ctive, it is not possi ble to be out of alignm ent with the evolution of the uni verse, and even hum an unc onsc iousne ss and the suf fering it generates is part of that evolution. When you can't stand the endl ess cycle of suf fering anym ore, you being to awaken. So the pain­body too has its necessa ry place in the larger picture. PRES EN CE A wom an in her thirties came to see me. As she greeted me, I coul d sense the pain behind her pol ite and supe rficial sm ile. She started telling me her story, and within one second her sm ile changed into a grimace of pain. The n, she began to sob unc ont rollably. She said she felt lone ly and unf ulfilled. The re was much anger and sadne ss. As a child she had been abuse d by a"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"physically violent father. I saw quickly that her pain was not cause d by her present life circum stances but by an extraordinarily heavy pain­body . Her pain­body had becom e the filter through which she viewed her life situation. She was not yet able to see the link between the emotiona l pain and her thought s, being com pletely identified with both. She coul d not yet see that she was feeding the pain­body with her thought s. In other words, she lived with the bur den of a deeply unha ppy self. At som e level, however, she must have realized that her pain originated within herself, that she was a bur den to herself. S he was ready t o a waken, a nd t his is w hy she ha d c om e. I directed the focus of her attention to what she was feeling insi de her body a nd a sked he r to se nse the emotion di rectly, instead of through t he filter of her unha ppy thought s, her unha ppy story. She said she had com e expe cting me to sho w her the way out of her unha ppi ness, not into it. Reluctantly, however, she did what I asked her to do. Tears were rolling down her face, her whol e body was sha king. “At this mom ent, this is what you feel.” I said. “The re is nothing you can do about the fact that at this mom ent this is what you feel. Now, instead of wanting this mom ent to be different from the way it is, which adds more pain to the pain that is already there, is it possi ble for you to com pletely accept that this is what you feel right no w?” She was quiet for a mom ent. Sudde nly she look ed impatient, as if she was about to get up, and said ang rily, “No, I don' t want to accept this.” “Who is spe aking? ” I asked her. “You or the unha ppi ness in you? Can you see that your unha ppi ness about being unha ppy is just another layer of unha ppi ness? ” She became quiet again. “I am not aski ng you to do anything. All I'm aski ng is that you find out whether it is possi ble for you to allow those feelings to be there. In other words, and this may sound strange, if you don' t mind being unha ppy, w hat ha ppe ns t o t he unha ppi ness? Don' t you w ant to f ind out ?” She look ed puz zled briefly, and after a minut e or so of sitting silently, I sudde nly noticed a signi ficant shi ft in her energy field. She said, “Thi s is weird. I 'm still unha ppy, but now there is spa ce around it. It seems to matter less.” Thi s was the first time I heard som ebody put it like that: The re is spa ce around my unha ppi ness.

Now he was shout ing at the other gue sts too, but for som e strange reason ignor ing me com pletely as I sat in intense Presence. I suspe cted that the uni versal hum an pain­body had com e back to tell me, “You thought you defeated me. Look , I'm still here.” I also consi dered the possi bility that the released energy field left behind after our sessi on followed me to the restaurant and attached itself to the one person in whom it found a com patible vibrationa l frequency, that is to say, a heavy pain­body . The manager ope ned the door , “Jus t leave. Jus t leave.” The man zoom ed out in his electric wheelchair, leaving everyone stunne d. One minut e later he returned. His pain­body wasn' t finishe d yet. It needed more. He pushe d ope n the door with his wheelchair, shout ing obsc enities. A waitress tried to stop him from com ing in.

A little later a pol iceman arrived, the man became quiet, was asked to leave and not return. The waitress fortuna tely was not hur t, except for bruises on her legs.

Children are not fool ed by parents who try to hide their pain­body from them, who say to each other, “We mustn't fight in front of the children.” Thi s usua lly means while the parents make pol ite conversation, the hom e is pervaded with negative energy. Suppr esse d pain­bodi es are extremely toxic, even more so than ope nly active one s, and that psy chic toxicity is absor bed by the children and c ont ribut es to t he de velopm ent of their own pa in­body .

In other words, it is an overreaction. Thi s is how it is recogni zed, although not usua lly by the suf ferer, the person posse sse d. Som eone with a heavy pain­body easily finds reasons for being upse t, ang ry, hur t, sad, or fearful.

The y are, of cour se, not the true cause but onl y act as a trigger. The y bring back to life the old accum ulated emotion.

The triggering event or situation is then interpreted and reacted to through the screen of a heavily emotiona l ego. Thi s is to say, its signi ficance becom es com pletely distorted. you look at the present through the eyes of the emotiona l past within you. In other words, what you see and expe rience is not in the event or situation but in you. Or in som e cases, it may be there in the event or situation, but you amplify it through your reaction. Thi s reaction, this amplification, is what the pain­body wants and needs, what it feeds on. For som eone posse sse d by a heavy pain­body , it is often impossi ble to step out side his or her distorted interpretation, the heavily emotiona l “story.” The more negative emotion there is in a story, the heavier and more impenetrable it becom es. And so the story is not recogni zed as suc h but is taken to be reality.

Not sur prisingly, peopl e with heavy and frequently active pain­bodi es often find themselves in conf lict situations. Som etimes, of cour se they actively provoke them. But at other times, they may not actually do anything. The negativity they emanate is enough to attract hos tility and generate conf lict. It requires a high degree of Presence to avoid reacting when conf ront ed by som eone with suc h an active pain­body . If you are able to stay present, it som etimes happe ns that your Presence enables the other person to disidentify from his or her own pain­body ad thus expe rience the miracle of a sudde n awakening. Although the awakening may be shor t­lived, the awakening pr ocess w ill ha ve be com e initiated. One of the first suc h awakenings that I witnesse d happe ned many years ago. My door bell rang close to eleven o'clock at night . My neighbor Ethel's anxi ety­laden voice came through the intercom . “We need to talk. Thi s is very impor tant. Please let me in.” Ethel was middl e­aged, intelligent, and highl y educ ated. She also had a strong ego and a heavy pain­body . She escaped form Nazi Germany when she was an adol escent, and many of her family m embers pe rishe d i n t he conc entration c amps. Ethel sat down on my sof a, agitated, her hands trembling. She took letters and doc um ents out of the file she carried with her and spr ead them out all over the sof a and floor . At onc e I had the strange sensa tion as if a dimmer sw itch had turned the insi de of my entire body to maximum power. The re was nothing to do other than remain ope n, alert, intense ly present – present with every cell of the body . I look ed at her with no thought and no judgm ent and listened in stillness without any mental com mentary. A torrent of words came out of her mout h. “The y sent me another disturbing letter toda y. The y are conduc ting a vende tta against me. You must help. We need to fight them together. The ir crook ed lawyers will stop at nothing. I will lose my hom e. The y a re threatening m e with di sposse ssi on. ” It transpi red that she refuse d to pay the service charge because the prope rty managers had filed to carry out som e repairs. The y in turn threatened t o t ake he r to c our t."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"She talked for ten minut es or so. I sat, look ed, and listened. Sudde nly she stoppe d talking, look ed at the papers all around her as if she had just woken up from a dream. She became calm and gentle. Her entire energy filed changed. The n she look ed at me and said, “Thi s isn' t impor tant at all, is it?” “No, it isn' t,” I said. She sat quietly for a coupl e more minut es, then picked up her papers and left. The next morning she stoppe d me in the street, looki ng at me som ewhat suspi ciousl y. “What did you do to me? La st night was the first ni ght in y ears that I slept well. In f act, I slept like a ba by.” She believed I had “done som ething” to her, but I had done nothing. Instead of aski ng what I had done to her, perhaps she shoul d have asked what I had not done . I had to reacted, not conf irmed the reality of her story, not fed her mind with more thought and her pain­body with more emotion. I had allowed her to expe rience whatever she was expe riencing at that mom ent, and the power of allowing lies in non­ interference, non­ doi ng. Being pr esent is a lways infinitely m ore po werful than a nything one coul d sa y or do, a lthough som etimes be ing pr esent can gi ve rise to w ords or actions. What happe ned to her was not yet a permanent shi ft, but a glimpse of what is possi ble, a glimpse of what was already within her. In Ze n, suc h a glimpse is called sat ori. Satori is a mom ent of Presence, a brief steppi ng out of the voice in your head, the thought processe s, and their reflection in the body as emotion. It is the arising of inne r spa ciousne ss where before there was the clutter of thought and t he turmoil of emotion. The thinki ng mind canno t unde rstand Presence and so will often misinterpret it. It will say that you are unc aring, distant, have no com passi on, are not relating. The truth is, you are relating but at a level deeper than thought and emotion. In fact, at that level there is a true com ing together, a true joining that goe s far beyond relating. In the stillness of Presence, you can sense the formless esse nce in your self and in the other as one . Knowing the one ness of your self and t he other is true love, true care, true com passi on. “TR IGGER S” Som e pain­bodi es react to onl y one particular kind of trigger or situation, which is usua lly one that resona tes with a certain kind of emotiona l pain suf fered in the past. For example, if a child grows up with parents for whom financial issue s are the sour ce of frequent drama and"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"conf lict, he or she may absor b the parents' fear around mone y and develop a pain­body that is triggered whenever financial issue s are involved. The child a adul t gets upse t or ang ry even over insi gni ficant amount s of mone y. Behind the upse t or anger lies issue s of sur vival and intense fear. I have seen spi ritual, that is to say, relatively consc ious, peopl e who started to shout , blame, and make accusa tions the mom ent they picked up the phone to talk to their stockbr oker or realtor. Jus t as there is a health warning on every package of cigarettes, perhaps there shoul d be similar warnings on every bankno te and bank statement: “Mone y can activate the pain­body and cause com plete unc onsc iousne ss.” Som eone who in childhood was neglected or abandone d by one or both parents will likely develop a pain­body that becom es triggered in any situation that resona tes even remotely with their primordial pain of abandonm ent. A friend arriving a few minut es late to pick them up at the airpor t or a spouse com ing hom e late can trigger a major pain­body attack. If their partner or spouse leaves them or dies, the emotiona l pain they expe rience goe s far beyond the pain that is natural in suc h a situation. It may be intense angui sh, long­ lasting, incapacitating depressi on, or obse ssi ve anger. A wom an who in childhood was physically abuse d by her father my find that her pain­body becom es easily activated in any close relationshi p with a man. Alternatively, the emotion that makes up her pain­body may draw her to a man whose pain­body is similar to that of her father. Her pain­ body may feel a magne tic pul l to som eone who it sense s will give it more of the sa me pa in. Tha t pa in i s som etimes m isinterpreted a s falling i n l ove. A man who had been an unwanted child and was given no love and a minimum of care and attention by his mother develope d a heavy ambivalent pain­body that consi sted of unf ulfilled intense longi ng for his mother's love and attention and at the same time intense hatred toward her for withhol ding what he so despe rately needed. When he became an adul t, almost every wom an woul d trigger his pain­body' s neediness – a form of emotiona l pain – and this woul d manifest as an addi ctive com pul sion to “conq uer and seduc e” almost every wom an he met and in this way get the female love and attention that the pain­body craved. He became quite an expe rt on seduc tion, but as soon as a relationshi p turned intimate or his advances were rejected, the"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"pain­body' s anger toward his mother woul d com e up and sabotage the relationshi p. When you recogni ze your own pain­body as it arises, you will also quickly learn what the most com mon triggers are that activate it, whether it be situations or certain things other peopl e do or say. When those triggers occur, you will immediately see them for what they are and enter a height ened state of alertness. Within a second or two, you will also notice the emotiona l reaction that is the arising pain­body , but in that state of alert Presence, you won' t identify with it, which means the pain­body canno t take you over and becom e the voice in your head. If you are with your partner at the time, you may tell him or her: “What you just said (or did) triggered my pain­body .” Have an agreement with your partner that whenever either of you says or doe s som ething that triggers the other person' s pain­body , you will immediately mention it. In this way, the pain­body can no long er renew itself through drama in the relationshi p and instead of pul ling you into unc onsc iousne ss, w ill he lp y ou be com e fully pr esent. Ev ery time you are present when the pain­body arises, som e of the pain­body' s negative emotiona l energy will bur n up, as it were, and becom e transm uted into Presence. The rest of the pain­body will quickly withdr aw and wait for a better oppor tuni ty to rise again, that is to say, when you are less consc ious. A better oppor tuni ty for the pain­body to arise may com e whenever you lose Presence, perhaps after you have had a few drink s or while watching a violent film. The tiniest negative motion, suc h as being irritated or anxi ous, can also serve as a door way through which the pain­ body can return. The pain­body needs your unc onsc iousne ss.

It occupi es your mind, cont rols and distorts your thinki ng, disrupts you relationshi ps, and feels like a dark cloud that occupi es your entire energy field. It tends to make you unc onsc ious, spi ritually spe aking, which means totally identified with mind and emotion.

Or it all becom es too much and you canno t live with your unha ppy self anym ore. The pain­body , of cour se, is part of that false se lf. Whenever you get taken over by the pain­body , whenever you don' t recogni ze it or what it is, it becom es part of your ego. Whatever you identify with turns into ego. The pain­body is one of the most powerful things the ego can identify with, just as the pain­body needs the ego to renew itself through it. Tha t unhol y alliance, however, eventually breaks down in those cases where the pain­body is so heavy that the egoi c mind structures, instead of being strengt hened by it, are becom ing erode d by the cont inuous onsl aught of the pain­body' s energy charge, in the same way that an electroni c device can be empowered by an electric current but also destroyed by i t if the voltage is too hi gh.

However, due to the unprecedented influx of consc iousne ss we are witnessi ng on the planet now, many peopl e no long er need to go through the depth of acute suf fering to be able to disidentify from the pain­body .

But it is not the pain­body , but identification with it that cause s the suf fering that you inflict on your self and others. It is not the pain­body but identification with the pain­body that forces you to relive the past again and again and keeps you in a state of unc onsc iousne ss. So a more impor tant question to ask woul d be this: “How long doe s it take to becom e free of identification w ith t he pa in­body? ” And t he answ er to t hat question: It takes no t ime at all.

And when identification with it ceases, the transm utation begins.

If your relationshi p with the Now is dysfunc tiona l, that dysfunc tion will be reflected in every relationshi p and every situation you encount er. The ego coul d be defined simply in this way: a dysfunc tiona l relationshi p with the present mom ent. It is at this mom ent that you can decide what kind of relationshi p you want to have with the present m om ent. Once you have reached a certain level of consc iousne ss, (and if you are reading this, you almost certainly have), you are able to decide what kind of a relationshi p you want to have with the present mom ent. Do I want the present mom ent to be my friend or my enemy? The present mom ent is inse parable from life, so you are really deciding what kind of a relationshi p you want to have with life. Once you have decided you want the present mom ent to be your friend, it is up to you to make the first move: becom e friendl y toward it, welcom e it no matter in what disgui se it com es, and soon you will see the resul ts.

The ego can never be in alignm ent with the present mom ent, which is to say, aligne d with life, since its very nature com pels it to ignor e, resist, or devalue the Now. Time is what the ego lives on. The strong er the ego, the more time takes over your life. Almost every thought you think is then conc erned with past or future, and you sense of self depends on the past for your identity and on the future for its fulfillment. Fear, anxi ety, expe ctation, regret, gui lt, anger are the dysfunc tions of the time­bound state of consc iousne ss. The re are three ways in which the ego will treat the present mom ent: as a means to and end, as an obs tacle, or as an enemy. Le t us look at them in turn, so that when this pattern ope rates in you, you can recogni ze it and – decide again. To the ego, the present mom ent is, at best, onl y use ful as a means to an end. It gets you to som e future mom ent that is consi dered more impor tant, even though the future never com es except as the present mom ent and is therefore never more than a thought in your head. In other words, you aren't ever fully he re be cause you a re always busy t rying t o g et elsewhere. When this pattern becom es more pronounc ed, and this is very com mon, the present mom ent is regarded and treated as if it were an obs tacle to be overcom e. Thi s is where impatience, frustration, and stress arise, and in our culture, it is many peopl e's everyda y reality, their nor mal state. Life, which is now, is seen as a “probl em,” and you com e to inha bit a world of probl ems that all need to be sol ved before you can be happy, fulfilled, or really start living – or so you think.

If you see me as a probl em, I will be a probl em to you. If you treat me as an obs tacle, I will be an obs tacle.” At worst, and this is also very com mon, the present mom ent is treated as if it were an enemy.

TH E P ARADOX OF TI ME On the sur face, the present mom ent is “what happe ns. ” Since what happe ns changes cont inuousl y, it seems that every day of your life consi sts of thousa nds of mom ents in which different things happe n. Time is seen as the endl ess suc cessi on of mom ents, som e “good, ” som e “bad.” Yet, if you look more close ly, that is to say, through your own immediate expe rience, you find that there are not many mom ents at all. You that there is onl y ever this mom ent. Life is always now. Your entire life unf olds in this cons tant Now.

The conf usi on of the present mom ent with cont ent gives rise not onl y to the illusi on of time, but also t o t he illusi on of ego. The re is a paradox here. On the one hand, how can we deny the reality of time? You need it to go from here to there, to prepare a meal, bui ld a house , read this book. You need time to grow up, to learn new things. Whatever you do seems to take time. everything is subj ect to it and eventually “this bloody tyrant time,” as Shakespe are calls it, is goi ng to kill you. You coul d com pare it to a raging river that drags you along with it, or a fire in w hich e verything i s c onsum ed. I recently met som e old friends, a family I had not seen in a long time, and I was shoc ked when I saw them. I almost asked, “Are you ill? What happe ned? Who did this to you? ” The mother, who walked with a cane, seemed to have shr unk in size, her face shr iveled like an old appl e. The daught er , who had been full of energy, enthusi asm , and the expe ctations of yout h when I last saw her, seemed worn out , tired after bringi ng up three children. The n I remembered: Almost thirty years had passe d since we last met. Time had done this to them. And I'm sur e they were just as shoc ked when t hey sa w m e. Ev erything seems to be subj ect to time, yet it all happe ns in the Now. Tha t is the paradox. Wherever you look , there is plenty of circum stantial evidence for the reality of time – a rotting appl e, your face in the bathroom mirror com pared to your face in a pho to taken thirty years ago – yet you never find any direct evidence, you never expe rience time itself. You onl y ever expe rience the present mom ent, or rather what happe ns in it. If you go by direct evidence onl y, then there is no time, and the Now is all there ever is.

Giving your self more time is precisely this: giving your “self” more time. Time, that is to say, past and future, is what the false mind­ made self, the ego, lives on, and time is in your mind. It isn' t som ething that has an obj ective existence “out there.” It is a mind structure needed for sensor y perception, indi spe nsa ble for practical pur pose s, but the greatest hindr ance to kno wing your self.

As long as it runs your life, there are two ways of being unha ppy. Not getting what you want is one . Getting what you want is the other. Whatever is or happe ns is the form that the Now takes.

ALLO WING TH E D IMI NISHMEN T O F TH E EG O The ego is always on gua rd against any kind of perceived diminishm ent. Autom atic ego­ repair mechanism s com e into effect to restore the mental form of “me.” When som eone blames or criticizes me, that to the ego is a diminishm ent of self, and it will immediately attempt to repair its diminishe d sense of self through self­justification, defense , or blaming. Whether the other person is right or wrong is irrelevant to the ego. It is much more interested in self­preservation than in the truth. Thi s is the preservation of the psy chol ogi cal form of “me.” Ev en suc h a nor mal thing as shout ing som ething back when another driver calls you “idiot” is an autom atic and unc onsc ious ego­ repair mechanism .

Those that are most extreme in their dysfunc tion are physical violence ad se lf­delusi on i n t he form of grandi ose fantasies. A powerful spi ritual practice is consc iousl y to allow the diminishm ent of ego when it happe ns without attempting to restore it. I recom mend that you expe riment with this from time to time. For example, when som eone criticizes you, blames you, or calls you names, instead of immediately retaliating or defendi ng your self – do nothing. Allow the self­ image to remain diminishe d and becom e alert to what that feels like deep insi de you. For a few seconds, it may feel unc om fortable, as if you had shr unk in size. The n you may sense an inne r spa ciousne ss that feels intense ly alive. You haven't been diminishe d at all. In fact, you have expa nde d. You may then com e to an amazing realization: When you are seemingly diminishe d in som e way and remain in absol ute non­ reaction, not just externally but also internally, you realize that nothing real has been diminishe d, that through becom ing “less,” you becom e more. When you no long er defend or attempt to strengt hen the form of your self, you step out of identification with form, with mental self­image. Thr ough becom ing less (in the ego' s perception) , you in fact unde rgo an expa nsi on and make room for Being to com e forward. True power, who you are beyond form, can then shi ne through the appa rently weakened form. this is what Jesus means when he sa ys, “ Deny y our self” or “Turn t he other cheek.” Thi s doe s not mean, of cour se, that you invite abuse or turn your self into a victim of unc onsc ious peopl e. Som etimes a situation may demand that you tell som eone to “back off” in no unc ertain terms. Without egoi c defensi veness, there will be power behind your words, yet no reactive force. If necessa ry, you can also say not to som eone firmly and clearly, and it will be what I call a “high­ quality no” that is free of all ne gativity. If you are cont ent with being nobody in particular, cont ent not to stand out , you align your self with the power of the uni verse.

Perhaps this is the reason alcohol is also called “spi rit.” But there is a high pr ice to pa y: unc onsc iousne ss. I nstead of rising a bove thought , you ha ve fallen below it. A few more drink s, and you will have regresse d to the vegetable realm. Space consc iousne ss has little to do with being “spa ced out .” Both states are beyond thought . Thi s they have in com mon.

REC OGNIZING INNER SPACE Space between thought s is proba bly already arising spor adically in your life, and you may not even kno w it. A consc iousne ss mesm erized by expe riences and condi tione d to identify exclusi vely with form, that is to say, obj ect consc iousne ss, finds it at first almost impossi ble to becom e aware of spa ce. Thi s ultimately mean that you canno t becom e aware of your self, because you are always aware of som ething else. You are cont inuousl y distracted by form. Ev en when you seem to be aware of your self, you have made your self into an obj ect, a thought form, and so what you are aware of is a thought , no t your self. When you hear of inne r spa ce, you may start seeking it, and because you are seeking it as if you were looki ng for an obj ect or for an expe rience, you canno t find it. Thi s is the dilemma of all those who are seeking spi ritual realization or enlight enm ent. Hence, Jesus said, “The kingdom of God is not com ing with signs to be obse rved; nor will they say, 'Lo, here it is!' or 'The re!' for be hol d, t he ki ngdom of God i s in t he m idst of you. ” 3 If you are not spe ndi ng all of your waking life in discont ent, worry, anxi ety, depressi on, despa ir, or consum ed by other negative states; if you are able to enjoy simple things like listening to he sound of the rain or the wind; if you can see the beauty of clouds moving across the sky or be alone at times without feeling lone ly or needing the mental stimulus of entertainm ent; if you find your self treating a com plete stranger with heartfelt kindne ss without wanting anything from him or her... it means that a spa ce has ope ned up, no matter how briefly, in the otherwise incessa nt stream of thinki ng that is the hum an mind. When this happe ns there is a sense of well­ being, of alive peace, even though it may be subt le. The intensi ty will vary from a perhaps barely noticeable background sense of cont entment to what the ancient sages of Indi a called ananda – the bliss of Being. Because you have been condi tione d to pay attention onl y to form, you are proba bly not aware of it except indi rectly. For example, there is a com mon element in the ability to see beauty, to appr eciate simple things, to enjoy your own com pany, or to relate to other peopl e with loving kindne ss. Thi s com mon"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"element is a sense of cont entment, peace, and aliveness that is the invisible background w ithout which t hese expe riences w oul d no t be possi ble. Whenever there is beauty, kindne ss, the recogni tion of the goodne ss of simple things in your life, look for the background to that expe rience within your self. But don' t look for it as if you were looki ng for som ething. You canno t pin it down and say, “Now I have it,” or grasp it mentally and define it in som e way. It is like the cloudl ess sky . It has no form. It is spa ce; it is stillness, the sw eetness of Being and infinitely more than these words, which are onl y poi nters. When you are able to sense it directly within your self, it deepens. So when you appr eciate som ething simple – a sound, a sight , a touc h – when you see beauty, when you feel loving kindne ss toward another, sense the inne r spa ciousne ss that is the sour ce and background to that expe rience. Ma ny poe ts and sages throughout the ages have obse rved that true happi ness – I call it the joy of Being – is found in simple, seemingly unr emarkable things. Mos t peopl e, in their restless search for som ething signi ficant to happe n to them, cont inuousl y miss the insi gni ficant, which may not be insi gni ficant at all. The phi losophe r Nietzsche, in a rare mom ent of deep stillness, rote, “For happi ness, how little suf fices for happi ness! .... the least ting precisely, the gentlest thing, the light est thing, a lizard's rustling, a breath, a wisk, an eye glance – little maketh up the best happi ness. Be still.” 4 Why is it the “least thing” that makes up “the best happi ness” ? Because true happi ness is not cause d by the thing or event, although this is how it first appe ars. The thing or event is so subt le, so unobt rusi ve, that it takes up onl y a sm all pa rt of your consc iousne ss – a nd t he rest is inne r spa ce, consc iousne ss itself unobs tructed by form. Inne r spa ce consc iousne ss and who you are in your esse nce are one and the same. In other words, the form of little things leaves room for inne r spa ce. And it is from inne r spa ce, the unc ondi tione d consc iousne ss itself, that true happi ness, the joy of Being, emanates.

A Ze n Ma ster was walking in silence with one of his disciples along a mount ain trail. When they came to an ancient cedar tree, they sat down unde r it for a simple meal of som e rice and vegetables. After the meal, the disciple, a young monk who had not yet found the key to the mystery of Ze n, broke the silence by a ski ng t he Ma ster, “Ma ster, ho w do I enter Ze n?” He was, of cour se, inquiring how to enter the state of consc iousne ss which i s Ze n.

He had been too busy thinki ng about the meaning of Ze n. Now as he began to listen for the sound, his noi sy mind subsi ded. At first he heard nothing.

Presence is a state of inne r spa ciousne ss. When you are present, you ask: How do I respond to the needs of this situation, of this mom ent? In fact, you don' t even need to ask the question. You are still, alert, ope n to what is. You bring a new dimensi on into the situation: Space. The n you look and you listen. Thus you becom e one with the situation. When instead of reacting against a situation, you merge with it, the sol ution arises out o the situation itself. Actually, it is not you, the person, who is looki ng and listening, but the alert stillness itself. The n, if action is possi ble or necessa ry, you take action or rather right action happe ns through you. Right action is action that is appr opr iate to the whol e. When the action is accom plishe d, the alert, spa cious stillness remains. The re is nobody who raises his arms in a gesture of trium ph shout ing a defiant “Yeah!” The re is no one ho says, “Look , I did that.” All creativity com es out of inne r spa ciousne ss. Once the creation has happe ned and som ething has com e into form, you have to be vigilant so that the notion of “me” or “mine” doe s not arise. If you take credit for what you accom plishe d, the ego has returned, and the spa ciousne ss has becom e obsc ured.

It even takes over your mind, the voice in your head, which then becom es the voice of the addi ction. It may be saying, “You' ve had a rough day. You deserve a treat. Why deny your self the onl y pleasur e that is left in your life?” And so, if you are identified with the internal voice due to lack of awareness, you find your self walking to the fridge and reaching for that rich choc olate cake. At other times, the addi ction may bypa ss the thinki ng mind com pletely and you sudde nly find your self puf fing on a cigarette or hol ding a drink. “How did that get into my hand? ” Taking the cigarette out of the packet and light ing it, or pour ing your self a drink were actions performed in com plete unc onsc iousne ss. If you have a com pul sive behavior pattern suc h as sm oki ng, overeating, drinki ng, TV watching, Internet addi ction, or whatever it may be, this is what you can do: When you notice the com pul sive need arising in you, stop and take three consc ious breaths. Thi s generates awareness. The n for a few minut es be aware of the com pul sive urge itself as an energy field insi de you. Consc iousl y feel that need to physically or mentally ingest or consum e a certain subs tance or the desire to act out som e form of com pul sive behavior. The n take a few more consc ious breaths. After that you may find that the com pul sive urge has disappe ared ­ for the time being. or you may find that it still overpowers you, and you canno t help but indul ge or act it out again. Don' t make it into a probl em. Ma ke the addi ction part of your awareness practice in the way described above. As awareness grows, addi ctive patterns will weaken and eventually dissol ve. Remember, however, to catch any thought s that justify the addi ctive behavior, som etimes with clever argum ents, as they arise in you mind. Ask your self, Who is talking here?

INNER BODY AWAREN ES S Another simple but highl y effective way of findi ng spa ce in you life is close ly linked to the breath. You will find that by feeling the subt le flow of air in and out of the body as well as the rise and fall of your chest and abdom en, you are also becom ing aware of the inne r body . Your attention may then shi ft from the breath to that felt aliveness within you, diffuse d throughout the body . Mos t peopl e are so distracted by their thought s, so identified with the voices in their heads, they can no long er feel the aliveness within them. To be una ble to feel the life that animates the physical body , the very life that you are, is the greatest deprivation that can happe n to you. You then begin to look not onl y for subs titutes for that natural state of well­being within, but also for som ething to cover up the cont inuous une ase that you feel when you are not in touc h with the aliveness that is always there but usua lly overlook ed. Som e of the subs titutes peopl e seek out are drug­ induc ed highs, sensor y overstimulation suc h as excessi vely loud musi c, thrills or dangerous activities, or an obse ssi on with sex. Ev en drama in relationshi ps is use d as a subs titute for that genui ne sense of aliveness. The most sought ­after cover­up for the cont inuous background une ase are intimate relationshi ps: a man or a wom an who is goi ng to “make me happy.” It is, of cour se, also one of the most frequently expe rienced of all the “letdowns. ” And when the une ase sur faces a gain, pe opl e will usua lly bl ame their pa rtner for it. Take two or three consc ious breaths. Now see if you can detect a subt le sense of aliveness that pervades your entire inne r body . Can you feel your body from within, so to spe ak? Sense briefly spe cific parts of your body . Feel your hands, then your arms feet, and legs. Can you feel your abdom en, chest, neck and head? What about your lips? Is there life in them? The n becom e aware again of the inne r body as a whol e. You may want to close your eyes initially for this practice, and onc e you can feel your body , ope n your eyes, look around, and cont inue to feel your body at the same time.

Physicists have discovered that the appa rent sol idity of matter is an illusi on created by our sense s. this include s the physical body , which we perceive and think of as form, but 99.99% of which is actually empty spa ce. Thi s is how vast the spa ce is between the atom s com pared to their size,and there is as much spa ce again within each atom . The physical body is no more than a mispe rception of who you are. In many ways, it is a microcosm ic version of out er spa ce. To give you an idea of how vast the spa ce ins between celestial bodi es, consi der this: light traveling at a cons tant spe ed of 186,000 miles (300,000 kilom eters) per second takes just over one second to travel between the earth and the moon; light from the sun takes about eight minut es to reach the earth. Light from our nearest neighbor in spa ce, a star called Proxima Centauri, which is the sun that is close st to our own sun, travels for 4.5 years before it reaches the earth. Thi s is how vast the spa ce is that sur rounds us. And then there is the intergalactic spa ce, whose vastness defies all com prehensi on. Light from the galaxy close st to our own, the Andr om eda Galaxy, takes 2.4 million years to reach us. Isn' t it amazing that your body i s just as spa cious a s the uni verse? So your physical body , which is form reveals itself as esse ntially formless when you go deeper into it. It becom es a door way into inne r spa ce. Although inne r spa ce has no form, it is intense ly alive. Tha t “empty spa ce” is life in its fullness, the unm anifested Sour ce out of which all manifestation flows. The traditiona l word f or that Sour ce is G od. Thought s and words belong to the world of form; they canno t expr ess the formless.

However, a pur ely intellectual recogni tion or belief “I am not this form” doe s not help.

Or we an appr oach this truth sing a different poi nter. Ask your self, “Am I aware not onl y of what is happe ning at this mom ent, but also of the Now itself as the living timeless inne r spa ce in which everything happe ns? ” Although this question seems to have nothing to do with the inne r body , yo may be sur prised that by becom ing aware of the spa ce of Now, you sudde nly feel more alive insi de.

In the first mom ent of seeing som ething or hearing a sound – and more so if it is unf amiliar – before the mind names or interprets what your see or hear, there is usua lly a gap of alert attention in which the perception occurs. Tha t is the inne r spa ce. Its dur ation differs from person to person. It is easy to miss because in many peopl e those spa ces are extremely shor t, pe rhaps onl y a se cond or less. Thi s is what happe ns: A new sight or sound arises, and in the first mom ent of perception, there is a brief cessa tion in the habitual stream of thinki ng. Consc iousne ss is diverted away form thought because it is required for sense perception. A very unusua l sight or sound may leave you “spe echless” ­ even i nsi de, that is to sa y, br ing a bout a long er gap. The frequency and dur ation of those spa ces determine your ability to enjoy life, to feel an inne r conne ctedne ss with other hum an beings as well as nature.

CHAP TER NI NE YOUR INNE R PUR POSE As soon as you rise above mere sur vival, the question of meaning and pur pose becom es of paramount impor tance in your life. Ma ny peopl e feel caught up in the rout ines of daily living that seem to deprive their life of signi ficance. Som e believe life is passi ng them by or has passe d them by already. Others feel severely restricted by the demands of their job an suppor ting a family or by their financial or living situation. Som e are consum ed by acute stress, others by acute bor edom . Som e are lost in frantic doi ng; others are lost in stagna tion. Ma ny peopl e long for the freedom and expa nsi on that prospe rity prom ises. Others already enjoy the relative freedom that com es with prospe rity and discover that even that is not enough to endo w their lives with meaning. The re is no subs titute for findi ng true pur pose . But the true or primary pur pose of your life canno t be found on the out er level. It doe s not conc ern what you do but what you are – that is to say, your state of consc iousne ss. So the most impor tant thing to realize is this: Your life has an inne r pur pose and an out er pur pose . Inne r pur pose conc erns Being and is primary. Outer pur pose conc erns doi ng and is seconda ry. While this book spe aks mainly of your inne r pur pose , this chapter and the next will also addr ess the question of how to align out er pur pose and inne r pur pose in your life. Inne r and out er, however, are so intertwined that is almost impossi ble to spe ak of one without referring t o t he other. Your inne r pur pose is to awaken. It is as simple as that. You sha re that pur pose with every other person on the planet – because it is the pur pose of hum anity. Your inne r pur pose is an esse ntial part of the pur pose of the whol e, the uni verse and its emerging intelligence. Your out er pur pose can change over time.

For most peopl e it is not an event but a process they unde rgo. Ev en those rare beings who expe rience a sudde n, dramatic, and seemingly irreversible wakening will still go through a process in which the new state of consc iousne ss gradua lly flows into and transf orms everything they do a nd so be com es integrated i nto t heir lives. Instead of being lost in your thinki ng, when you are awake you recogni ze your self as the awareness behind it. Thi nki ng then ceases to be a self­serving autonom ous activity that takes posse ssi on of you and runs your life. Awareness takes over from thinki ng. Instead of being in charge or your life, thinki ng becom es the servant of awareness. Awareness is consc ious conne ction with uni versal intelligence. Another word for it is Presence: consc iousne ss w ithout thought . The initiation of the awakening process is an act of grace. You canno t make it happe n nor can you prepare your self for it or accum ulate credits toward it. The re isn' t a tidy sequence of logi cal steps that leads toward it, although the mind woul d love that. You don' t have to becom e worthy first. It may com e to the sinne r before it com es to the saint, but not necessa rily. Tha t's why Jesus assoc iated with all kinds of peopl e, not just the respe ctable one s. The re is nothing you can do about awakening. Whatever you do will be the ego trying to add awakening or enlight enm ent to itself as its most prized posse ssi on and thereby making itself more impor tant and bigger. Instead of awakening, you add the conc ept of awakening to your mind, or the mental image of what an awakened or enlight ened person is like, and then try to live up to that image. Living up to an image that you have of your self or that other peopl e have of you is inauthentic living – another unc onsc ious role the ego pl ays. So if there is nothing you can do about wakening, if it has either already happe ned or not yet happe ned, how can it be the primary pur pose of your life?

Once it has done so, it canno t be reversed, although it can be delayed by the ego. For som e peopl e, the reading of this book will initiate the awakening process. For others, the func tion of this book is to help them recogni ze that they have already begun to awaken and to intensi fy and accelerate the process. Another func tion of this book is to help peopl e recogni ze the ego within them whenever it tries to r egain c ont rol and obsc ure the arising a wareness.

And whatever meaning or fulfillment you find will dissol ve or turn out to have been a deception. Invariably, it will be destroyed by time. Any meaning we find on that level is true onl y relatively and tempor arily. For example, if caring for your children gives meaning to your life, what happe ns to that meaning when they don' t need you and perhaps don' t even listen to you anym ore? If helping others gives meaning to your life, you depend on others being worse off than your self so that your life can cont inue to be meaningf ul and you can feel good about your self. If the desire to excel, win, or suc ceed at this or that activity provides you with meaning, what if you never win or your winni ng streak com es to an end one day, as it will? You woul d then have to look to your imagination or memories – a very unsa tisfactory place to bring som e meager meaning into your life. “Ma king it” in whatever field is onl y meaningf ul as long as there are thousa nds or millions of others who don' t make it, so you need other hum an beings to “fail” so t hat your life can ha ve m eaning.

The paradox is that the founda tion for greatness is honor ing the sm all things of the present mom ent instead of pur sui ng the idea of greatness. The present mom ent is always all in the sense that it is always simple, but conc ealed within it lies the greatest power.

Or it may be more true to say that it then has access to you and through you to tis world. Jesus was referring to this power when he said, “ It is no t I but the Father within m e who doe s the works.” And “ I can of my own self do nothing. ” 1 Anxi ety, stress, and negativity cut you off from that power. The illusi on that you are separate form the power that runs the uni verse returns. You feel your self to be alone again, strugg ling against som ething or trying to achieve this or that.

The re are two reasons why we don' t see this uni ty, why we see things as separate. One is perception, which reduc es reality to what is accessi ble to us through the sm all range of our sense s: what we can see, hear, sm ell, taste, and touc h. But when we perceive without interpreting or mental labeling, which means without addi ng thought to our perceptions, we can actually still sense the deeper conne ctedne ss unde rneath our perception of seemingly separate things. The other more serious reason for the illusi on of separateness is com pul sive thinki ng. It is when we are trappe d in incessa nt streams of com pul sive thinki ng that the uni verse really disintegrates for us, and we lose the ability to sense the interconne ctedne ss of all that exists.

The out er pur pose of the uni verse is to create form and expe rience the interaction of forms – the play, the dream, the drama, or whatever you choose to call it. Its inne r pur pose is to awaken to its formless esse nce. The n com es the reconc iliation of out er and inne r pur pose : to bring that esse nce – consc iousne ss – into the world of form and thereby transf orm the world. The ultimate pur pose of that transf ormation goe s far beyond anything the hum an mind can imagine or com prehend. And yet, on this planet at this time, that transf ormation is the task allotted us. Tha t is the reconc iliation of out er and inne r pur pose , the reconc iliation of the world and God. Before we look at what relevance the expa nsi on and cont raction of the uni verse has to your own life, we need to bear in mind here that nothing we say about the nature of the uni verse shoul d be taken as an absol ute truth. Neither conc epts nor mathematical formulae can expl ain the infinite. No thought can encapsul ate the vastness of the totality. Reality is a uni fied whol e, but thought cuts it up into fragm ents. Thi s gives rise to funda mental mispe rceptions., for example, that there are separate things and events, or that this is the cause of that .

A BRIEF HISTORY OF YOUR LI FE The com ing into manifestation of the world as well as its return to the unm anifested – its expa nsi on and cont raction – are two uni versal movements that we coul d call the out goi ng and the return hom e. Those two movements are reflected through the uni verse in many ways, suc h as in the incessa nt expa nsi on and cont raction of your heart, as well as in the inha lation and exha lation of your breath. The y are also reflected in the cycles of sleep and wakefulness. Ea ch night , without kno wing it, you return to the unm anifested Sour ce of all life when you enter the stage of deep, dreamless sleep, and then reemerge again i n t he m orning, r eplenishe d. Those two movements, the out goi ng and the return are also reflected in each person' s life cycles. Out of nowhere, so to spe ak, “you” sudde nly appe ar in this world.

Thi s is also the time when out er pur pose – growth – tends to becom e usur ped by the ego, which unl ike nature doe s not kno w when to stop in its pur sui t of expa nsi on and has a voracious appe tite for more.

Ea ch person' s life – each life­form, in fact – represents a world, a uni que way in which the uni verse expe riences itself. And when your form dissol ves, a world c om es to a n e nd – one of count less w orlds. AWAKEN ING AND TH E R ETU RN MO VEMEN T The return movement in a person' s life, the weakening or dissol ution of form, whether through old age, illness, disability, loss, or som e kind of persona l tragedy, carries great potential for spi ritual awakening – the dis­ identification of consc iousne ss from form. Since there is very little spi ritual truth in our cont empor ary culture, not many peopl e recogni ze this as an oppor tuni ty, and so when it happe ns to them or to som eone close to them, they think there is som ething dreadfully wrong, som ething that shoul d not be happe ning. The re is in our civilization a great deal of ignor ance about the hum an condi tion, and the more spi ritually ignor ant you are, the more you suf fer. For many peopl e, particularly in the West, death is no more than an abstract conc ept, and so they have no idea what happe ns to the hum an form when it appr oaches dissol ution. Mos t decrepit and old peopl e are shut away in nur sing hom es. Dead bodi es, which in som e older cultures are on ope n displ ay for all to see , are hidde n away. Try to see a dead body , and you will find that it is virtually illegal, except if the deceased is a close family member. In fune ral hom es, they even appl y makeup to the face. You are onl y allowed t o se e a sa nitized v ersion of de ath. Since death is onl y an abstract conc ept to them, most peopl e are totally unprepared for the dissol ution of form that awaits them. when it appr oaches, there is shoc k, incom prehensi on, despa ir, and great fear. Nothing makes sense anym ore, because all the meaning and pur pose that life had for them was assoc iated with accum ulating, suc ceeding, bui lding, protecting, and sense gratification. It was assoc iated with the out ward movement and identification with form, that is to say, ego.

Thi s is to say, their inne r pur pose woul d emerge onl y as their out er pur pose collapse d and the she ll of the ego woul d begin to crack ope n. Such events represent the beginni ng of the return movement toward the dissol ution of form. In most ancient cultures, there must have been an intuitive unde rstandi ng of this process, which is why old peopl e were respe cted and revered. The y were the reposi tories of wisdom and provided the dimensi on of depth without which no civilization can sur vive for long. In our civilization, which is totally identified with the out er and ignor ant of the inne r dimensi on of spi rit, the word old has mainly negative conno tations. It equals use less and so we regard it as almost an insul t to refer to som eone as old. To avoid the word, we use euphe mism s suc h as elderly and senior. The First Nation' s “grandm other” is a figur e of great digni ty. Toda y's “granny” is at best cute. Why is old consi dered use less?

In som e peopl e, the out ward movement of growth and expa nsi on gets severely disrupted by a seemingly premature onse t of the return movement, the dissol ving of form. In som e cases, it is a tempor ary disruption; in others a permanent one . We believe that a young child shoul d not have to face death, but the fact is that som e children do have to face the death of one or both parents through illness or accident – or even the possi bility of their own death. Som e children are bor n with disabilities that severely restrict the natural expa nsi on of their lives. Or som e severe limitation com es into a person' s life at a relatively y oung a ge. The disruption of the out ward movement at a time when it is “not meant to be happe ning” can also potentially bring forth an early spi ritual awakening n a person. Ultimately, nothing happe ns that is not meant to happe n, which is to say, nothing happe ns that is not part of the greater whol e and its pur pose .

When you have had a direct expe rience of the uns table nature of all forms, you will likely never overvalue form again and thus l ose your self by bl indl y pur sui ng i t or attaching y our self to i t. The oppor tuni ty that the dissol ution of form, and in particular, old age, represents is onl y just beginni ng to be recogni zed in our cont empor ary culture. In the majority of peopl e, that oppor tuni ty is stile tragically misse d, because the ego identifies with the return movement just as it identified with the out ward movement. Thi s resul ts in a hardening of the egoi c she ll, a cont raction rather than an ope ning.

Until now, hum an intelligence, which is no more than a minut e aspe ct of uni versal intelligence, has been distorted and misuse d by the ego. I call that “intelligence n the service of madne ss.” Splitting the atom requires great intelligence. Using that intelligence for bui lding and stockpi ling atom bom bs is insa ne or at best extremely uni ntelligent. Stupi dity is relatively harmless, but intelligent stupi dity is highl y dangerous. Thi s intelligent stupi dity, for which one coul d find count less obvious examples, is threatening our sur vival as a spe cies. Without he impairment of egoi c dysfunc tion, our intelligence com es into full alignm ent with the out goi ng cycle of uni versal intelligence and its impul se to create. We becom e consc ious participants in the creation of form. It is not we who create, but uni versal intelligence that creates through us. We don' t identify with what we create and so don' t lose our selves in what we do. We are learning that the act of creation may involve energy of the highe st intensi ty, but that is not “hard work” or stressf ul. We need to unde rstand the difference between stress and intensi ty, as we sha ll see. Strugg le or stress is a sign that he ego has returned, as are negative reactions when we encount er obs tacles.

We are also learning that action, although necessa ry, is onl y a seconda ry factor in manifesting our external reality. The primary factor in creation is consc iousne ss.

We woul d onl y re­create modi fied versions of the same world again and again, a world that is a n e xternal reflection of the ego. CONSCIOUSNES S Consc iousne ss is already consc ious. It is the unm anifested, the eternal. the uni verse, however, is onl y gradua lly becom ing consc ious. Consc iousne ss itself is timeless and therefore doe s not evolve.

No hum an mind is capable of com prehendi ng fully the reason for this process. But we can glimpse it within our selves a nd be com e a consc ious pa rticipant in i t. Consc iousne ss is the intelligence, the organizing principle behind the arising of form. Consc iousne ss has been preparing forms for millions of years so t hat it can e xpr ess i tself through t hem in t he m anifested.

And then begins the next incarnation, the next identification with form, the next indi vidua l dream that is part of the collective dream. When the lion tears apart the body of the zebra, the consc iousne ss that incarnated into the zebra­form detaches itself from the dissol ving form and for a brief mom ent awakens to its esse ntial immortal nature as consc iousne ss; and then immediately falls back into sleep and reincarnates into another form. When the lion becom es old and canno t hunt anym ore, as it draws its last breath, there is again the briefest of glimpse s of an a wakening, f ollowed b y a nother dr eam of form. On our planet, the hum an ego represents the final stage of uni versal sleep, the identification of consc iousne ss with form. It was a necessa ry stage in t he evolution of consc iousne ss. The hum an brain is a highl y differentiated form through which consc iousne ss enters this dimensi on. It cont ains appr oximately one hundr ed billion nerve cells (called neurons) , about the same num ber as there are stars in our galaxy, which coul d be seen as a macrocosm ic brain. The brain doe s not create consc iousne ss, but consc iousne ss created the brain, the most com plex physical form on earth, for its expr essi on. When the brain gets damaged, it doe s not mean you lose consc iousne ss. It means consc iousne ss can no long er use that form to enter this dimensi on.

Thr ough awakened hum ans w ho ha ve learned t he m eaning of awakened doi ng. Awakened doi ng is the alignm ent of your out er pur pose ­ what you do – with your inne r pur pose – awakening and staying awake. Thr ough awakened doi ng, you becom e one with the out goi ng pur pose of the uni verse. Consc iousne ss flows through you into this world. It flows into your thought s and i nspi res them. It flows into w hat you do a nd gui des a nd e mpowers it. Not what you do, but how you do what you do determines whether you are fulfilling your destiny. And how you do what you do is determined by y our state of consc iousne ss. A reversal of your priorities com es about when the main pur pose for doi ng what you do becom es the doi ng itself, or rather, the current of consc iousne ss that flows into what you do. Tha t current of consc iousne ss is what determines quality. Another way of put ting it: In any situation and in whatever you do, your state of consc iousne ss is the primary factor; the situation and what you do is seconda ry. “Future” suc cess is depende nt upon and inse parable from the consc iousne ss out of which the actions emanate. Tha t can be either the reactive force of the ego or the alert attention of awakened consc iousne ss.

Ea ch one represents a certain vibrationa l frequency of consc iousne ss. You need to be vigilant to make sur e that one of them ope rates whenever you are engaged in doi ng anything at all – from the most simple task to the most com plex. If you are not in the state of either acceptance, enjoym ent, or enthusi asm , look close ly and you will find that you a re creating suf fering f or your self and o thers. ACCEP TANCE Whatever you canno t enjoy doi ng, you can at least accept that this is what you have to do. Acceptance means: For now, this is what this situation, this mom ent, requires me to do, and so I do it willingly. We already spok e at lengt h about the impor tance of inne r acceptance of what happe ns, and acceptance of what you have to do is just another aspe ct of it. For example, you pr oba bly w on' t be able to e njoy c hangi ng t he flat tire on y our car at ni ght in the middl e of nowhere and in pour ing rain, let alone be enthusi astic about it, but you can bring acceptance to it. Performing an action in the state of acceptance means you are at peace while you do it. Tha t peace is a subt le energy vibration which then flows into what you do. On the sur face, acceptance look s like a passi ve state, but in reality it is active and creative because it brings som ething entirely new into this world. Tha t peace, that subt le energy vibration, is consc iousne ss, and one of the ways in which ti enters this world is through sur rende red action, one aspe ct of which is acceptance. If you can neither enjoy or bring acceptance to what you do – stop. Otherwise, you are not taking responsi bility for the onl y thing you can really take responsi bility for, which also happe ns to be one thing that really matters: your state of consc iousne ss.

When you make the present mom ent, instead of past and future, the focal poi nt of your life, your ability to enjoy what you do – and with it the quality of your life – increases dramatically. Joy is the dyna mic aspe ct of Being. When the creative power of the uni verse becom es consc ious of itself, it manifests as joy. You don' t have to wait for som ething “meaningf ul” to com e into your life so that you can finally enjoy what you do. The re is more meaning in joy than you will ever need.

The four teenth­century Persian poe t and Sufi master Hafiz expr esse s this truth beautifully: “I am a hol e in a flute that the Christ's breath moves through.

Ent husi asm mans there is deep enjoym ent in what you do plus the adde d element of a goa l or a vision that you work toward. When you add a goa l to the enjoym ent of what you do, the energy­field or vibrationa l frequency changes. A certain degree of what we might call structural tensi on is now adde d to enjoym ent, and so it turns into enthusi asm . At the height of creative activity fueled by enthusi asm , there will be enor mous intensi ty and energy behind what you do. You will feel like an arrow hat is moving toward the target – a nd e njoying t he jour ney. To an onl ook er, it may appe ar that you are unde r stress, but the intensi ty of enthusi asm has nothing to do with stress. When you want to arrive at your goa l more than you want to be doi ng what you are doi ng, you becom e stresse d. The balance between enjoym ent and structural tensi on is lost, and the latter has won. When there is stress, it is usua lly a sign that the ego has returned , and you are cutting your self off form the creative power of the uni verse.

Unlike stress, enthusi asm has a high energy frequency and so resona tes with the creative power of the uni verse. Thi s is why Ralph Waldo Em erson said that, “Nothing great has ever been achieved without enthusi asm .” 2 The word enthusi asm com es from ancient Greek – en and theos meaning God. And the related word enthousi aze in means “to be posse sse d by a god. ” With enthusi asm you will find that you don' t have to do it all by your self. In fact, there is nothing of signi ficance that you can do by your self. Sustained enthusi asm brings into existence a wave of creative energy, and a ll you ha ve to do t hen i s “ ride the wave.” Ent husi asm brings an enor mous empowerment into what you do, so that all those who have not accesse d that power woul d look upon “your achievements in awe and may equate them with who you are. You, however, kno w the truth that Jesus poi nted to when he said, “I can of my own self do nothing. ” 3 Unlike egoi c wanting, which creates opposi tion indi rect propor tion to the intensi ty of its wanting, enthusi asm never oppose s. It is non­ conf ront ationa l. Its activity doe s not create winne rs and lose rs. It is based on inclusi on, not exclusi on, of others. It doe s not need to use and manipul ate peopl e, because it is the power of creation itself and so doe s not need to take energy from som e seconda ry sour ce.

At the core of all utopi an visions lies one of the main structural dysfunc tions of the old consc iousne ss: looki ng to the future for salvation.

Y ou a re trappe d i n f orm, and t hat is e go. “And I saw a new heaven and a new earth,” 5 writes the biblical prophe t. the founda tion for a new earth is a new heaven – the awakened consc iousne ss.

N othing i s goi ng t o m ake us f ree be cause onl y the present mom ent can make us free. Tha t realization is the awakening. Awakening as a future event has no meaning because awakening is the realization of Presence. So the new heaven , the awakened consc iousne ss, is not a future state to be achieved.
