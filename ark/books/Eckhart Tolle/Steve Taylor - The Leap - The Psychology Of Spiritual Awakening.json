These two words not only describe who you are as a memberof a particular species but, if examined more deeply, also point to the twofoldnature of your identity. Human is who you are on the level of form; that is tosay, your body and mind. Those two aspects of your form identity make up yourconditioned self. That self is conditioned by genetics and the environment, aswell as other factors as yet unknown to science. Being, on the other hand,points to the essence of who you are as timeless, formless, and unconditionedconsciousness. Human and being, form and essence, are ultimately not separate,in the same way that a wave or ripple on the surface of the ocean is notseparate from the ocean or from any other wave or ripple, although it may appearto be so.Being, or pure consciousness, emanates from the Universal Source of all life —God — as light emanates from the sun. Unlike the sun, however, the Source doesnot exist in space and time. It is unmanifested and therefore inconceivable, sothere is nothing you can say about it. However, your consciousness emanates fromthe Source, so you can never be separate from it, just as a ray of sunlightcannot be separate from the sun but always remains connected with it. The Sourceemanation pervades the entire cosmos — which is to say, our dimension of spaceand time — and it is the intelligence underlying and guiding the evolution ofwhat we perceive as the physical universe. So the universe, including humanbeings, was not just created in the distant past but is still in the process ofbeing created. It’s a work in progress, so to speak. You need to understand thisbasic premise to be able to appreciate and derive great benefit from readingthis book. As Steve Taylor puts it, evolution is not just behind us, but infront of us as well.Furthermore, and contrary to the creed of our mainstream culture, there isdirection and purpose behind the evolutionary process, as he explains in thisbook. Where it is going, however, is beyond all imagination. What we can say isthat the evolutionary impulse behind the process is the growth of consciousness.The universe wants to become more conscious, and the main life purpose for allhuman beings is to come into alignment with that universal purpose. Seen from ahigher perspective, of course, all that exists is already in alignment with it,even if it seems to be opposed to that purpose, but it is aligned onlyunconsciously. Entering into conscious alignment with universal purpose is anamazing evolutionary leap.However, what does it really mean for human beings at their current evolutionarystage to “become more conscious” or to “awaken”? If I had to put it in anutshell, I would define it as “disidentification from thinking.” When yourealize that the voice in your head, your incessant compulsive thinking, is notwho you are, then you have begun to awaken. A new dimension of consciousness hasarisen, which we could call awareness, presence, or wakefulness. You haven’tfallen below thought; you have risen above it. Now you can use thought insteadof being used by it. Your sense of self shifts from identification with yourmental positions and narratives to the alive presence within you, which isconsciousness itself. You realize the being behind the human, so to speak.Something that transcends your conditioned personality begins to emerge. Yourealize your essential identity as unconditioned consciousness itself, and youcan verify within yourself the truth of Jesus’s words: “You are the light of theworld.”Although this book provides plentiful conceptual clarification regardingwakefulness, as well as many highly interesting firsthand accounts by people whohave experienced that shift in consciousness, you cannot truly understand themeaning of awakening except through awakening, which means going beyonddiscursive thinking and concepts. The concepts, however, can be helpful if usedrightly, as pointers toward realization rather than as ultimate explanations ormental constructs that you need to believe in. In any case, this book will be ofreal benefit to readers who are either already undergoing the awakening processor who have reached a point of readiness, perhaps as a result of experiencing adeep crisis, a loss, or some kind of psychological turmoil in their lives. Thisbook can greatly assist those readers in understanding what is happening to themand coping with the confusion or disorientation that often accompanies theinitial stages of that shift in consciousness. Others may discover that theyhave already had awakening experiences without realizing it or that they havebeen going through a gradual awakening for some time without recognizing it forwhat it is.The fact that enormous collective challenges almost certainly lie ahead forhumanity — most of them self-created by the unawakened, egoic state ofconsciousness that still has the majority of humans in its grip — should not beinterpreted as an indication that a more widespread awakening is not going tooccur. The opposite is probably the case: the crises we are experiencing, andthe greater turmoil to come, may act as a catalyst for a collective shift inconsciousness. As Steve Taylor puts it: “The evolutionary leap was already underway before these problems became so serious, but perhaps it has become — and isbecoming — more powerful as a result of them.”Challenges are the lifeblood of all evolution. Every life-form, from plants toanimals to humans, evolves as a response to the challenges it encounters. Yourcomfort zone is not the most likely place where you are going to find spiritualawakening, although the ego may tell you otherwise. If you look to people,places, things, or circumstances for fulfillment or happiness, you will bedisappointed again and again. Don’t tell the world, “Make me happy!” You wouldbe placing an impossible demand on it and condemning yourself to perpetualfrustration. Instead, allow the world to make you conscious. You may find thatevery challenge, every obstacle that life seems to put in your path, is anopportunity for awakening, for becoming present, or for deepening the state ofpresence. Many challenges you encounter, whether of a personal or collectivenature, will have been created by human unconsciousness, either your own or thatof other people. Every seeming obstacle to your happiness or fulfillment is apotential portal into presence! Just modify your response to it and see whathappens. Your life is not determined by what happens to you, but by how yourespond to what happens. Most importantly, don’t add to the collectiveunconsciousness, which manifests particularly in the media and politics, throughyour reactivity. Bring the light of consciousness to every encounter, everyproblem, and every Facebook post!Life always gives you what you need, and right now it has given you this book touse as a guide or companion through challenging times. It contains a great dealof precious wisdom, expressed in the straightforward, clear, and down-to-earthlanguage that Steve Taylor is so good at. I have a feeling that, by way of amiracle, it may even reach one or two people in the media and in politics!— Eckhart Tolle, bestselling author ofThe Power of Now and A New Earth"},{"pageContent":"Introduction [part0005.html#rfm2]I used to think that spiritual awakening was out of the ordinary — an extremelyrare state that is practically impossible to attain, unless you’re prepared tobecome a hermit and spend decades meditating for hours a day in solitude andsilence. I thought that probably only a small number of human beings in historyhad ever become awakened, that is, attained an ongoing state of inner peace andwholeness with a sense of connection or unity with the world around them, and aselfless desire to love and support their fellow human beings. I certainlyhadn’t met anyone like that, and I didn’t expect to — at least not in thislifetime. It goes without saying that I didn’t consider myself to be awakenedeither.I associated spiritual awakening with Eastern traditions, such as Buddhism andHinduism. The term enlightenment conjured images of monks with shaved heads andred robes, or gurus with long beards surrounded by flowers and prostratingdevotees. I assumed that if there were any spiritual awakened people alive, mostof them were in India, or perhaps Tibet or China. After all, that is where thegreatest and purest spiritual traditions and the world’s most profound spiritualtexts such as the Upanishads and the Dao De Jing came from.In comparison, my own Western European culture seemed like a spiritual desert. Iliked reading about Christian mystics, and it was clear that some of them hadbeen spiritually awakened (or at least had had glimpses of awakening), but theChristian religion itself seemed too laden with beliefs and concepts to serve asa framework for spiritual awakening. The happiness paradigm of my culture meantdoing well at school and college, getting a good job with good prospects, buyinga nice house where I could entertain myself by watching television and surroundmyself with possessions and comforts. Life was all about achievement andentertainment, material goods and fun. Surely if I wanted to find enlightenmentor awakened individuals, I had to go to the East.I was wrong. This book describes how I came to learn that spiritual awakening isfar from uncommon. It describes how I came to learn that it doesn’t just happento Eastern sages but to seemingly ordinary people in all walks of life. Itdescribes how, after a number of encounters with ordinary awakened people, Ibegan to study spiritual awakening as a psychologist.My study began with the dissertation for my master’s degree, then my PhD, andthen my research as an academic. I began to seek out people who had undergone ashift into a higher — a more expansive and harmonious — state of being.Initially, for my master’s dissertation, I sought out people who had undergonethis shift following intense trauma and turmoil in their lives. I was surprisedhow easy it was to find cases, and many more people contacted me to sharesimilar experiences once my initial research was published. Then I decided tobroaden my research and investigate cases of spiritual awakening that weren’tspecifically linked to turmoil and trauma. I investigated other types ofawakening — people who had undergone a gradual awakening through years ordecades of spiritual investigations or practice, and a small number of peoplewho simply seemed to be naturally awakened; that is, people who have been awakefor as long as they can remember, without making any special effort orundergoing any transformative experience.The vast majority of people I interviewed aren’t spiritual teachers and don’tsee themselves as part of any particular spiritual tradition or religion. Thesepeople have conventional jobs and no backgrounds in spiritual traditions orpractices. (As a result, in many cases, they were initially confused by whathappened to them.) Partly because of this, I began to detach the concept ofawakening from religious and even spiritual traditions. I began to see it as aparticular state of mind and being that could be interpreted in terms ofspiritual traditions but didn’t necessarily belong to them.Throughout history, the shift into wakefulness has often happened to people whowere part of religious or spiritual traditions, and so it was usuallyinterpreted in terms of those traditions. If it happened to a Buddhist monk, theshift was described as bodhi, or “enlightenment”; if it happened to a Hindu, itmight be termed moksha (freedom) or sahaja samadhi (permanent or ongoingoneness); if it happened to a Sufi, it might be described as baqa, or “abidingin God”; if it happened to a Christian, it might be termed deification, or unionwith God. However, the shift into wakefulness can also occur — and most oftendoes, according to my research — outside these traditions and so doesn’t have tobe interpreted in religious or spiritual terms.Different spiritual traditions explain and interpret this shift in differentways, emphasizing different aspects. It’s as if they offer different views ofthe same landscape, magnifying, filtering, and selecting certain features. Butwhen the shift occurs outside spiritual traditions — that is, in people whodon’t have a spiritual background and so don’t have a ready framework withinwhich to interpret it — it’s as if we’re given a view of the landscape itself,in a more naked and unconstructed state.Through my research as a psychologist I’ve attempted to identify thecharacteristics of this shift, the different ways in which it can occur, and thereasons why it occurs. What are the triggers or causes of awakening? Why does itoccur to some people and not others? What actually happens inside a person’sbeing or psyche when they experience awakening? In what way do awakened orwakeful people experience the world differently than others? How are theirrelationships, values, and goals different? How does wakefulness relate to ourspecies as a whole and to the overall evolution of consciousness?These are some of the main topics I’ll be discussing throughout this book.There’s a great deal of confusion about enlightenment — partly because it hasbeen interpreted in so many different ways by different teachers in differenttraditions — and I’d like to dispel some of this. Terms such as spiritualawakening and enlightenment often have different meanings to different people.If you ask a hundred different spiritual teachers how they define wakefulness orenlightenment, you will probably get a hundred different answers. Many peoplehave an impulse to wake up but, because of this general confusion, they aren’tcompletely sure where they’re heading or where they should go. I hope to clearup some of this confusion by clearly identifying the characteristics ofwakefulness and by establishing exactly what it means to live in the state.My Approach in This BookThis book stems from other important avenues of study, besides my research as apsychologist. I’ve been studying the world’s spiritual traditions and practicessince the age of nineteen. I’ve gained a thorough, wide-ranging knowledge oftheir different interpretations and approaches, how they understand andinterpret the state of wakefulness, and the practices and paths they recommendto cultivate it. I don’t adhere to any particular tradition myself, althoughI’ve always felt a strong affinity with Indian traditions such as Vedanta, Yoga,and Tantra, and also with Chinese Daoism. At the same time, I have a deeprespect for the Buddhist, Christian, Jewish, and Sufi spiritual traditions.Another important avenue is my own personal experience of wakefulness, whichimpelled me to investigate the state and without which none of my research wouldmake any sense. Although this book isn’t autobiographical, it describes how, inthe process of discovering that the state of wakefulness is much more commonthan I had realized, I also discovered that it is in the closest place of all —my own being. After believing that awakening only happened to a small number ofpeople in remote parts of the world, I came to realize that it had actuallyhappened to me.I don’t try to explain away this state as the result of unusual brain activity.As a psychologist, I’ve never been particularly interested in studying the brainand examining the type of neuronal activity associated with particularexperiences. Some scientists have suggested that spiritual experiences can belinked to increased or reduced activity in certain parts of the brain, but tome, this isn’t particularly relevant. It’s like studying the map of a countryrather than exploring the country itself.The assumption that spiritual experiences are generated by certain types ofbrain activity is highly dubious. For a start, the assumption that the brain isthe source of any of our conscious experience is problematic. In the language ofthe philosophy of consciousness, this is the “hard problem” of explaining howthe soggy lump of matter that we call the brain can give rise to the amazingrichness and variety of our subjective experience. (One philosopher suggeststhis is the equivalent of turning water into wine.1 [part0027.html#rfm2en1])In fact, it’s just as valid to reverse this causal link and suggest that, ifthere are any particular brain-states associated with awakening experiences,these states can be produced by the experiences themselves rather than the otherway around. If you’re walking in the countryside and a bear jumps out in frontof you, you will experience a surge in adrenaline and increased activity in theparts of the brain associated with fear and stress. Your experience of seeingthe bear will correlate with a certain neurological state. But this neurologicalstate doesn’t produce the image of the bear. Wakeful states exist in themselvesas experiences and can’t be reduced to — or explained away in terms of —neurological activity.In a similar way, I don’t think it’s possible to explain wakefulness away asself-delusion. Some people, including some self-appointed spiritual teachers orgurus, undoubtedly delude themselves into thinking that they’re awakened. Butthis certainly isn’t the case for the majority of people I encountered. I wasdeeply impressed by the insight and authenticity with which they described theirnew identities and experiences. Rather than escaping from reality into delusion,they have entered an intensified and expanded reality. They are living in ahigher-functioning state, with a more authentic purpose, more authenticrelationships, and an increased sense of connection. It is clear from the majorchanges they have made to their lives — and from the incomprehension they haveattracted from the people around them — that they aren’t just thinkingthemselves into believing that they’re spiritually awakened. The difficultiessome of them faced after awakening, including a sense of confusion, alsoindicate this. After all, if they wanted to escape into a self-delusory state ofwell-being, they would surely have excluded these difficulties from theirexperience.At the same time, we should be alert to the possibility that some claims ofwakefulness may not be genuine, whether this is due to self-delusion,narcissism, or a more straightforward desire to exploit vulnerable followers inorder to gain wealth and power. In fact, one of the aims of my research — and ofthis book — is to establish the characteristics of the wakeful state so clearlythat there’s a means of distinguishing between fake and genuine wakefulness.Because spiritual teachers are unregulated, there has always been a problem withdeluded or exploitative people setting up themselves as gurus and wreaking havocamong vulnerable followers. But if we have a clear idea of what it actuallymeans to be awake, then it should be easier to identify fraudulent or deludedteachers.A SequelThe Leap is a kind of sequel, although an unusual one in that it’s a sequel totwo of my previous books rather than just one.One of my previous books, Waking from Sleep, is a study of temporary awakeningexperiences or higher states of consciousness. I had always experienced thesemyself, and for several years I collected reports of them. In Waking from SleepI analyze these experiences, looking at the characteristics, situations, andactivities that generated them, and the underlying psychological and ontologicalprocesses that took place when they occurred. (Here I use the term ontologicalto refer to our being, in the same way that the term psychological refers to themind.) I put forward a theory that the experiences are linked to anintensification and stilling of life-energy. This book attempts somethingsimilar but for states of permanent wakefulness.However, The Leap is also, as its name suggests, a sequel to my earlier book,The Fall, which focuses on anthropology, archeology, and history. It suggeststhat the original state of human beings was one of natural wakefulness, in whichpeople experienced the sacredness and aliveness of the world around them andfelt a strong connection with nature and the whole cosmos. According to TheFall, earlier human beings experienced no sense of separateness from the worldand could sense a powerful spirit-force pervading everything, including theirown being. However, beginning about six thousand years ago, a “Fall” occurred.This was a shift of being, the development of a new kind of human self, with anintensified sense of individuality and a new sense of separateness. For thefirst time, human beings experienced themselves as separate from nature, fromtheir own communities, and even from their own bodies. For the first time, theyexperienced themselves as individual entities living within their own mentalspace, with the rest of reality “out there,” on the other side.On an external cultural level, this shift expressed itself in many devastatingways. It caused a massive upsurge in brutality, conflict, and oppression. Itgave rise to hierarchal societies and constant warfare between different groups.It led to the oppression of women and a new, repressive, guilt-ridden attitudetoward sex. On an internal ontological level, it meant a loss of the naturalspirituality that earlier peoples experienced (and that was retained by some ofthe world’s indigenous peoples — some of whom retain it even now). Our ancestorslost a sense of nature’s sacredness and aliveness, a sense of connection to thecosmos, and the awareness of the spirit-force pervading everything. The worldbecame despiritualized and we became separate from it. We “fell” out of anatural state of harmony into a state of anxiety and discord.Spiritual awakening is, in some ways, a reversal of this process. It meansundoing the pathology of separateness and duality and regaining the sense ofconnection and harmony that earlier peoples experienced. However, at the sametime, spiritual awakening entails a “leap” into a new state of being. Despiteits disastrous effects, the new sense of individuality that our ancestorsdeveloped in the Fall brought some benefits: a new intellectual acuity that ledto technological advances and a more rational understanding of the world. Whenwe undergo a leap into spiritual wakefulness, we retain these benefits. Weattain what might be called a trans-Fall state, which integrates the spiritualawareness of pre-Fall peoples with the intellectual-logical ability of the“fallen” era.The term Leap has both an individual and a collective meaning. On an individuallevel, it refers to the shift out of an ordinary state of being into the moreexpansive higher-functioning state of wakefulness. And just as the Fall refersto a collective psychological shift that some groups of human beings began toundergo thousands of years ago, the Leap, on a collective level, refers to amovement toward wakefulness that I believe is occurring throughout the world,and involves the whole human race. The Leap is also a process of collectivespiritual awakening.The Structure of This BookThe structure of this book loosely follows the stages of awakening itself. Webegin by examining the ordinary state of being that we wake up out of. We’ll seethat almost every culture in history has been aware of the possibility of wakingup out of this limited state into a more expansive and intense awareness. Wealso examine the different ways in which different cultures have conceived ofwakefulness.Then we look at the process of awakening. I suggest that there are threedifferent ways in which a person can wake up permanently. There are a smallnumber of people who seem to have been born awake, whose awakened state unfoldsnaturally and easily without any special effort or particular event. Then thereare those who wake up gradually over a long period of time, through a commitmentto spiritual practice such as meditation and yoga, or through followingspiritual paths, traditions, or lifestyles. And finally — and this is thelargest group — there are those who wake up suddenly and dramatically, oftenfollowing intense psychological turmoil. Because it is the most common form, wespend quite a bit of time examining sudden and dramatic awakening, and lookingat several examples from my research.Then we examine the aftermath of awakening and the difficulties that cansometimes occur. Particularly when it occurs suddenly and dramatically,awakening may involve a phase of spiritual crisis. In its most benign form, thismay simply be a period of confusion. At the same time as feeling an intensesense of well-being and inner peace or fullness, the newly awakened person maybe slightly puzzled by their new state, without a framework to make sense of it.In most cases, they will naturally gravitate toward spiritual traditions andpractices, and come to understand the nature of their transformation. But inmore extreme cases, sudden awakening may be very disruptive and causepsychological problems that could be mistaken for psychosis. There may even bephysical problems, including unexplained pains and an inability to sleep. If thenewly awakened person doesn’t understand what is happening, and if they aren’tsupported through the process, there’s a danger that they could be diagnosedwith psychosis or schizophrenia. In fact, I believe that a good number of peoplewho are labeled as mentally ill and put on high doses of psychotropic drugs mayactually have undergone (or be undergoing) spiritual awakening.Then we examine the characteristics of the wakeful state, based on my research,and how it differs from our normal sleep state. For me, these differences aremainly psychological and experiential. In many ways, awakened individualsexperience a higher-functioning state that makes life more fulfilling,exhilarating, and meaningful than it may appear in a normal state of being. As aresult of this internal shift, they often make major changes to their lives.They begin new careers, hobbies, and relationships. They feel a strong impulseto make positive contributions to the world, to live in meaningful andpurposeful ways, rather than simply trying to satisfy their own desires, enjoythemselves, or pass the time.After discussing the characteristics of wakefulness, we compare thecharacteristics of the awakened state with some of the characteristics ofchildhood. Does wakefulness imply a return — at least in some senses — tochildhood? Is this perhaps what Jesus meant when he said that we must “becomelike little children” in order to “enter into the kingdom of heaven”?2[part0027.html#rfm2en2]In the final section of the book, we turn to the collective aspect of awakening.Here I suggest that the best way to understand the Leap is in evolutionaryterms. We’re speaking of an evolutionary leap. We examine the evidence that thiscollective Leap is already under way and suggest that what we know aswakefulness could be the next phase in the evolution of consciousness on ourplanet. Wakefulness is higher than the present normal human state in the sameway that the normal state is higher than the consciousness of other animals,including primates. In other words, awakened people may be prematurelyexperiencing a state that is latent in many other people — and in the wholehuman race collectively — and that will become more common as time goes by, andwill one day become the norm. As long as we don’t destroy the life-supportsystems of our planet and make ourselves extinct as a species, wakefulness mayeventually become human beings’ normal state.At a time when the world is suffering massive challenges, it is essential thatthis collective Leap unfolds as quickly as possible. Our own conscious effortsto awaken are important to intensify the shift that is already under way. Ourown personal evolution will contribute to the evolution of our whole species.A Note on TerminologyBefore sitting down to write this book, I thought long and hard about what termI should use to describe the state that is its subject. I initially consideredenlightenment, but I’ve never been particularly comfortable with this term,partly because it’s an inaccurate translation of the original Buddhist termbodhi. Nineteenth-century translators of Buddhist texts translated bodhi as“enlightenment,” but it derives from the Pali verb budh, which means “toawaken,” so the literal meaning of bodhi is closer to “awakening.” Also, there’sa tendency to think of enlightenment in completely positive terms, as a state ofperfect bliss and ease in which all difficulties and faults drop away. Thisdidn’t seem wholly appropriate in view of some of the difficulties that many ofmy interviewees experienced.I therefore decided to continue with the waking terminology that I adopted inWaking from Sleep, where I used terms like awakening experiences and sleep. Inthe present book, I use awakening to describe the shift from a normal to ahigher state of being and the term wakefulness to describe the higher stateitself. For me, the term wakefulness isn’t as positively loaded asenlightenment. Wakefulness implies a wider, deeper, and more open awareness,which might not necessarily be a straightforward, trouble-free state.Although I sometimes use the term spiritual awakening (even in the title of thisbook), I prefer the simple term awakening. As I’ve said, wakefulness, for me, isprimarily a state of being, which often occurs outside the context of spiritualor religious traditions. I also suspect that the term spiritual encouragespeople to esotericize the state, to think of it as extraordinary andotherworldly, when I see it as natural and normal.I initially toyed with more psychologically valid terms such ashigher-functioning state, state of expanded being, or state of optimum being.But those sounded a little too clinical. In any case, the primary function ofwords is to describe concepts and pass on meaning from one person to another.Sometimes it’s better to use terms that are familiar rather than inventing newones. The terms awakening and wakefulness aren’t perfect, nor could they everbe. After all, the state to which they refer transcends language. Ordinarylanguage was designed to describe ordinary states of awareness, not a state inwhich subject/object duality fades away and the past and the future have nomeaning or else become one with the present. Words are only signposts. And ifyou have already experienced the wakeful state yourself — even if onlytemporarily — then you know the reality to which they are pointing."},{"pageContent":"1. Falling Asleep, Longing to Awaken [part0005.html#rch1]When we use terms such as wakefulness and awakening it’s important to understandwhat we’re waking up from. In other words, it’s important to understand the“normal” state of being that we transcend when we wake up.As my terminology suggests, what we wake up from is essentially a state of sleep— a state of constricted, limited awareness, and of discord and suffering. Thisstate is so familiar to us that we assume it’s natural and normal, and we takeit for granted. But, in fact, this state is aberrational, even pathological.It’s a kind of madness that we confuse with sanity simply because we experiencereal sanity so rarely.Here I’ll discuss the main characteristics of this state of sleep. I won’t gointo extensive detail, as this is an area I’ve already covered in my previousbooks. For the sake of clarification, I’ll divide the characteristics into fourdifferent categories. In chapters 12[part0019.html#I3QM0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5] and 13[part0020.html#J2B80-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5] I’ll look at thecharacteristics of wakefulness using the same categories.Bear in mind that there are variations in these characteristics. There aredifferent degrees of sleep, just as there are different degrees of wakefulness.Some people are more asleep than others, just as some people are more awake thanothers.Affective Characteristics of SleepThe affective characteristics refer to the inner experience of being asleep, howit feels to live in a sleep state. The main aspect of this experience is oursense of separation and disconnection.Separation and DisconnectionAs I suggest in The Fall and Waking from Sleep, prehistoric humans — and later,the people who became known to us as indigenous peoples — experienced the worldin a very different way than most of us in the modern world. One of the maindifferences is that they appear to have had very little sense of separation fromthe world. They felt closely connected to nature, to their land, and to thewhole of the earth, to the extent that they didn’t see themselves as individualsin the same way that we do. Their sense of identity extended into their land andtheir whole community. This is part of the reason why indigenous peoples havebeen so horrified by European people’s rapacious attitude toward nature, theirtreatment of it as nothing more than a supply of riches and resources to beransacked. Indigenous peoples feel a strong empathic connection to nature, thatit’s part of their own being, and so recoil from hurting the earth in the sameway they recoil from harming themselves.The collective psychological shift that our ancestors underwent thousands ofyears ago — the point when human beings began to “fall” asleep — occurred whenthey lost this sense of connection. A new, highly individualized sense of selfdeveloped. People began to experience themselves as egos enclosed within theirown mental space, looking out at the world. For the first time, they experiencedthemselves as separate from the natural world — not beings who were living innature, as a part of it, but beings who were somehow outside nature.This new separate self brought a sense of ego-isolation, of apartness andaloneness. There was a new duality; our ancestors were “in here” with the restof reality “out there.” There was also a fragmentedness, as if human beings werefragments broken off the whole, with a feeling of loss and incompleteness. Otherpeople were also “out there.” As human beings, we became less connected to oneanother, with a weakened sense of empathy and community. Our own needs anddesires as individuals began to take precedence over the welfare of the wholegroup.This sense of separateness even extended to the body. Rather than see the bodyas an integrated part of our being, we saw the self — our own ego — as an entitytrapped inside a body that was somehow other to us; the body was a vehicle thatwas carrying us but wasn’t actually part of us. At the same time, we becamedisconnected from our own being — from our essence or spirit. Our sense ofidentity became constricted to a very narrow focus — our own ego. In the sameway that a city can become so large and prominent that it seems to be a separateentity from the rest of the land that it’s a part of — and in the same way thatthe inhabitants of the city can lose touch with the rest of the land and seethemselves just as city dwellers — we lost contact with the expansive radianceand spaciousness of our whole being.Thought-ChatterOne of the strangest characteristics of our sleep state is the associationalchatter — the endless stream of images, memories, anticipations, reflections,and snippets of information — that usually runs through our minds when we don’toccupy our attention with external things. Again, we largely take this forgranted, so it’s difficult for us to understand how bizarre it really is. Whyshould we experience this random and involuntary thought-chatter whenever weturn our attention into our own minds? It seems to be a quirk of our stronglydeveloped sense of ego, perhaps one that occurs when our ability to self-reflectcombines with our abilities to recollect the past, anticipate the future, andimagine different scenarios. It seems also to be related to our sense ofego-isolation and the constrictedness of our sense of self, almost as if ourthoughts become restless and agitated in response to the atmosphere of anxietyand lack of space.AbstractionBecause of our ego-isolation and the thought-chatter that almost constantly runsthrough our minds, we spend much of our time in a state of abstraction. Ratherthan live in the world, we live in our minds. We perceive the world dimly,through the mist of our thought-chatter and filters of preexisting concepts.Rather than live in a state of mindfulness, genuinely experiencing the realityof our sensations and perceptions, we live in a state of elsewhereness (as Irefer to it in my book Back to Sanity).In Back to Sanity I suggest that there are three different modes of attentionthat we experience as we live our lives: abstraction, absorption, and awareness(the “three As”). Abstraction is when we immerse our attention in our thoughts.Absorption is when we immerse our attention in external objects such asactivities or entertainment. Awareness is when we give our attention fully toour experience, our surroundings, and the perceptions and sensations we’rehaving in the present moment.When I teach courses and workshops (either at my university or independently), Ioften ask participants to estimate how much time they spend in each of thesemodes in a typical day. People tell me, almost without fail, that they spend theleast amount of time in a state of awareness. Typically, people estimate thatthey spend most time in a state of absorption (an average of around 60 percent),with their attention immersed in tasks, chores, hobbies, or distractions. Theyspend the second greatest amount of time in a state of abstraction (around 30percent), and only around 10 percent of the time in a state of awareness.Anxiety and DiscontentThe internal mental atmosphere of the sleep state is a negative one. It’s adark, dank, and oppressive place, the mental equivalent of a small room with nowindows and hardly any light.The constant chatter of our minds creates a sense of disturbance andrestlessness inside us, and the frequently negative tone of our thought-chattergenerates negative emotions and an overall negative mood. Meanwhile, ourego-separateness creates a sense of lack, of “something missing,” as well as asense of isolation. Finally, there’s a sense of narrowness, with our sense ofself confined to the tiny space of our own ego, disconnected from the wide-openspace of our whole being and its quality of radiance.In our sleep state there’s also a sense of fear. Our separateness creates asense of vulnerability and insecurity, of being threatened by the world and byother people. This insecurity is exacerbated by our chattering thoughts, whichanticipate the future and create fear-based scenarios that we imaginerepeatedly. There’s also usually an underlying fear of death, which we may noteven be conscious of. Death threatens us by seeming to represent the end ofeverything we are, and everything we achieve or accumulate. It generates a senseof absurdity and meaninglessness, and so we do our best not to think about ourown mortality.A Perceptual Characteristic: Deintensified PerceptionAnother major characteristic of prehistoric and indigenous peoples’ experienceof the world was their intense perception of their surroundings. They seem tohave had a sense that natural things were alive and sentient, and pervaded witha spiritual force. Different peoples with no connection to each other haddifferent names for this spiritual force. In the Americas, the Hopi called itmaasauu, the Lakota called it wakan-tanka, and the Pawnee called it tirawa. TheAinu of Japan called it ramut (translated as “spirit-energy”), while indigenouspeoples in parts of New Guinea called it imunu (translated as “universal soul”).In Africa, the Nuer called it kwoth and the Mbuti called it pepo. These conceptsare strikingly similar to the universal spirit-force that spiritual and mysticaltraditions speak of — for example, the concept of brahman in the IndianUpanishads. This spiritual force was also part of the reason for indigenouspeoples’ respectful attitude toward nature and their dismay at European peoples’exploitative attitude toward it. In addition to feeling a sense of kinship withthe natural world, they felt it was spiritually alive and therefore sacred.How did we lose this intense perception of nature and this awareness of aspirit-force in the world? How did the natural world become less real to us,more mundane and less sacred and beautiful?This is partly because we live so much inside ourselves, in a state ofabstraction. Our experience of the world is therefore less direct and immediate.But this loss of vividness is also related to energy. Our powerful sense of ego— and our constant thought-chatter — uses up a massive amount of energy, and asa result there’s little energy available for us to use through perception. Itmay even be that, when the Fall occurred, our perception became automatized as akind of energy-conserving measure so that the powerful new ego could have moreenergy at its disposal. Our attention was switched off to the world around us sothat we didn’t have to “waste” any energy in perceiving it.As a result, the world became an inanimate place to us. We no longer sensed thealiveness of rivers, rocks, and the earth itself. We no longer sensed thesentience of trees and other plants, nor the consciousness of insects and otheranimals. The world became full of objects, which we were free to use and abusefor our own devices. We lost the awareness of a spirit-force pervading the worldand all the things in it.Rather than see all things as infused with this force and therefore allinterconnected, we began to perceive separateness. The world became made up ofdistinct material objects with empty space stretching between them. As a result,we also lost the meaning and harmony that many indigenous peoples perceive inthe world, and the sense of being at home in it. For us, the world became aneutral and even hostile place, and life became an empty space between birth anddeath for us to try to fill with enjoyment and any sense of meaning we couldcreate through our own efforts.Conceptual CharacteristicsThe sleep state is characterized not only by a certain kind of perception butalso by a type of conception — that is, a certain outlook on the world, andsense of our identity and our place within it.Egocentric OutlookIn conceptual terms, one of the main characteristics of sleep is a narrowness ofoutlook. In sleep, people tend to be immersed in a narrow personal world ofproblems and concerns. They aren’t particularly interested in other people’sproblems, or in social or global issues. Environmental problems, for instance,are too abstract and vague for them to make sense of. They aren’t particularlyconcerned about global inequality or poverty, or even about inequality orpoverty (or oppression or exploitation) within their own countries. Generally,because of their narrow vision, they only become concerned about these issueswhen they have a direct effect on them — for example, once disruption to weathersystems brings regular floods in their towns or when they (or members of theirfamily) are exploited or oppressed. Otherwise, these issues are too wide forthem to comprehend, and their personal needs and desires usually take precedenceover them.Group IdentityIn sleep, people have a strong need for identity and belonging. They feel apowerful impulse to belong to groups and to identify themselves as members ofthose groups in terms of religion, ethnicity, nationality, and any other labelthey can find. They like to define themselves as Christians or Muslims, Croatsor Serbs, English or Scottish or Welsh, Republicans or Democrats or Socialists —even Manchester United or Los Angeles Lakers fans. Accordingly, they seethemselves as distinct and different from those who belong to other groups, andare liable to fall into conflict with those groups whose interests may conflictwith theirs. They feel the urge to help expand the power and influence of theirgroup — for example, to convert people to their religion — and feel a sense ofpride when their group prospers, such as when their nation expands its territoryor when their sports team wins a trophy.This need for identity and belonging is largely because of the sense ofvulnerability and fragility generated by our separateness. We feel alone withinour own mental space, with an overwhelmingly vast and complex world “out there,”on the other side. We feel threatened and so need some support, to feel part ofsomething bigger than ourselves, to provide shelter and protection.As we’ll see later, in wakefulness there’s a completely different perspective.Awakened individuals have little or no sense of group identity. They seedistinctions of religion or ethnicity or nationality as superficial andmeaningless. They see themselves purely as human beings, without any externalidentities, who are no different from anyone else. As a result, they don’t putmembers of their own group before others, but rather treat all people equally.They don’t feel any pride in their nationality or ethnicity; they feel just asconnected to “foreigners” as they do to their own “people.”Behavioral CharacteristicsBecause the sleep state brings so much discord and discontent, the effort toescape from their psychological suffering dominates many people’s lives.There are two major ways that people try to alleviate their unease. First, theytry to simply divert themselves from their inner discord by immersing theirattention in external things. This partly explains the massive popularity oftelevision over the past half century or so — it’s a simple and effective way todirect our attention outside ourselves and so escape our inner discord. Second,people try to overcome their basic sense of separateness and lack by addingthings to themselves. They try to make themselves more significant byaccumulating possessions and wealth, collecting achievements, or increasingtheir success, status, or power.The sense of vulnerability and fragility I mentioned above also has a majorimpact on our behavior. Along with creating the need to join groups and take ondifferent identities, it creates a strong need for acceptance. It makes us keento fit in, to do what we feel is expected of us rather than follow our deeperimpulses. As a result, we’re in danger of living inauthentically, of suppressingour true selves for the sake of acceptance.This sense of vulnerability also generates a strong sensitivity to slights orinsults. Because we feel fundamentally insecure, it’s easy for us to feeldisrespected, to feel wounded by other people’s behavior toward us, even if theydon’t intend to offend us. These emotional wounds often fester inside us for along time, giving rise to resentment, creating grudges, and often leading toconflict between individuals and groups.image [../images/00006.jpeg]So this is our normal state of sleep: a state of separation and discord, inwhich we feel trapped inside our own mental space and subjected to the randomchatter of thoughts and associations, and in which we’re preoccupied with ourpersonal concerns and dominated by a desire to escape our discord throughdiversion and accumulation.Temporary WakefulnessThis state of sleep holds a great deal of power over us. Apart from duringchildhood, some people never experience any other way of being. They spend everymoment of their lives asleep, without ever realizing that they’re asleep.Consequently, they don’t realize that it’s possible to wake up. They’re likeprisoners who don’t realize they’re in prison, and so never think aboutescaping.Very occasionally, however, most of us do experience brief moments ofwakefulness, when the limitations to our normal awareness fall away and weglimpse a more intense reality. In Waking from Sleep, I examine accidental andtemporary experiences of wakefulness. I define an awakening experience as “anexperience of clarity, revelation, and joy in which we become aware of a deeper(or higher) level of reality, perceive a sense of harmony and meaning, andtranscend our normal sense of separateness from the world.”1[part0027.html#rch1en1]Awakening experiences occur when we temporarily transcend our normal state ofbeing — or, more strictly speaking, our normal self-system. The structure of ournormal self-system — with its strong sense of ego, firm boundaries, andautomatic perception — dissolves away, like a tent swept away in a wind. Thiscan happen in times of inner relaxation and stillness, when our normalthought-chatter fades away and there’s a higher level of energy inside us,infusing our perceptions and enabling us to perceive the world more vividly.This is why awakening experiences are often generated by contact with nature,meditation, watching or listening to arts performances, and other sedate,mind-quieting activities.Alternatively, our normal self-system may be temporarily swept away as a resultof intense stress and psychological turmoil. In fact, my research shows thatintense psychological turmoil — perhaps caused by loss, failure, divorce, orbereavement — is the most common trigger of awakening experiences (with contactwith nature, meditation, and watching or listening to arts performancesfollowing closely behind). Turmoil and stress can be like an earthquake,breaking down the structure of the normal self and allowing a more expansive andintense state of being to unfold.Different intensities of awakening experiences and different characteristicsemerge at different intensities. A low-intensity awakening experience may be anexperience of heightened awareness in which your surroundings become more real,alive, and beautiful. A medium-intensity awakening experience may include apowerful sense of connection, a feeling that you’re no longer separate from yoursurroundings. You might feel a strong sense of compassion or love toward otherhuman beings (and other living beings), sensing that you’re not separate fromthem either. You might have an awareness that all things are pervaded with — orare manifestations of — a radiant spiritual energy so that all are essentiallyone. In a high-intensity awakening experience, the whole material world may seemto dissolve into an ocean of pure consciousness or blissful radiance, which youfeel is the essence of the universe. You might sense that this is the essence ofyour own being, too, so that in a sense you are the universe.The more intense awakening experiences are, the less common they are. Probablymost of us have had low-intensity awakening experiences, and probably only asmall number of us have had high-intensity ones.However, awakening experiences are, by definition, only temporary. They mightlast a few seconds, a few hours, even a few days, but at some point the normalself-system reemerges and reestablishes itself, and we return to our normalstate of being. It’s almost as if our normal self-system exists as a kind ofpsychic mold or template, which is always able to reform. Or to use anothermetaphor, it’s as if a tree has been blown down but its roots are still intactso that it can grow again.But in permanent wakefulness the structure doesn’t reform. Our normalself-system dissolves away permanently — not only the structure but also themold or template so that it isn’t able to reform. The tree is completelyuprooted. In permanent wakefulness a new, higher-functioning self-system takesover, with a more expansive and intense awareness. The shift is so fundamentalthat the person may feel that they have been reborn, that they are a differentperson living in the same body.In many ways the permanently wakeful state is a stable, ongoing variant of thetemporary awakening experience, with the same fundamental characteristics.Perhaps the only major difference is that permanent wakefulness includesconceptual and behavioral aspects — such as a loss of group identity, a strongtendency to altruism, and a lack of interest in materialism or status seeking —that aren’t so apparent in temporary awakening, simply because thesecharacteristics don’t have the opportunity to express themselves on a temporarybasis.I would therefore loosely define permanent wakefulness as a higher-functioningstate in which a person’s vision of and relationship to the world aretransformed, along with their subjective experience, their sense of identity,and their conceptual outlook. This shift brings a sense of well-being, clarity,and connection. The person develops a more intense awareness of the phenomenalworld, and a broad, global outlook, with an all-embracing sense of empathy withthe whole human race and a much-reduced need for group identity.You might doubt that it’s actually possible to live in this state. Wouldn’tpermanent wakefulness make it impossible for us to focus on the practicalitiesof everyday life? How would we concentrate on earning a living, cooking ourfood, paying our bills, and so on, while living in a state of ecstasy andoneness?It’s important to remember that people who live in this state can control theirexperience. They don’t helplessly swim in an ocean of blissful oneness all thetime — they can still concentrate on practical tasks when they need to. They canstill make decisions and plans, and organize their lives. But their sense ofwell-being, connection, and wholeness is always there as an undercurrent, in thebackground, which they can tune into at any moment.The wakeful state is higher functioning in a variety of ways. Along with havinga richer perception of the world and a more intense awareness, awakenedindividuals don’t feel a sense of incompleteness or disconnectedness. Theirminds aren’t constantly assailed by buzzing, chattering thoughts that create asense of discord and anxiety. They feel a fundamental sense of groundedness andwholeness, and a lack of self-centeredness. They’re no longer preoccupied withtheir own concerns and desires; they feel a high degree of compassion and astrong capacity for altruism and self-sacrifice. And as my definition mentions,they have a wide sense of perspective and a decreased need for group identity orbelonging, which means that they can extend compassion equally to all members ofthe human race (and other species) beyond all differences of culture andethnicity.As with temporary awakening experiences, there are different varieties anddegrees of permanent wakefulness. Some people’s wakefulness may be fairly lowlevel; the characteristics of the state aren’t particularly intense for them.For example, they may still experience some disruptive involuntarythought-chatter and occasionally find themselves identifying with it; and theymay occasionally find themselves getting caught up in self-centered desires orambitions. At the same time, they may experience a constant richness ofperception, and a constant sense of participation in and connection to theworld, rather than a sense of separation. They may also have little sense ofgroup identity and a wide sense of perspective, in which social or global issuesseem as important as their own personal issues. A person who experienceswakefulness to a high degree, however, may have little or no involuntarythought-chatter, and may experience a sense of unity with the world around themrather than simply connection. Again, as with awakening experiences, the moreintense and the deeper the state of wakefulness is, the less common it is.Over the next few chapters we’ll see that the shift into permanent wakefulnesscan occur both gradually and suddenly. In gradual wakefulness, there are manysteps along the journey between sleep and wakefulness, and many different shadesbetween the two states. We could say that, at different points, a person may beslightly awakened, moderately awakened, or highly awakened. Sudden awakening isslightly different in that there’s a dramatic shift from a state of sleep to astate of wakefulness without moving through the intermediate ground. But evenhere, there are different gradations of wakefulness. People can shift intohigher or lower intensities of wakefulness.You could think of the journey from ordinary consciousness to wakefulness as apath that leads up the side of a mountain (although it would be accurate tothink in terms of many different paths up the mountain rather than just one). Ingradual wakefulness, there’s a slow and steady journey up the path, which passesall points along the way. But in sudden wakefulness, a person shiftsdramatically to a point much further along the path, as if they have beenteleported there. Even so, there’s still a variety of different points that theycan shift up to, in the same way that a helicopter might lift someone up todifferent heights of a mountain."},{"pageContent":"2. Wakefulness in Different Cultures [part0005.html#rch2]When the state of sleep originally developed — at the time of the Fall — mostpeople accepted it as normal. They felt a sense of unease and frustration, butweren’t aware of its source, and did their best to alleviate or escape fromtheir psychological suffering.However, a small number of people didn’t accept their sleep state. Amongcultures that underwent the Fall, there were a small number of people whorebelled against sleep. These people had a strong sense that it was aberrationaland that their vision of the world was unnaturally constricted. They sensed thatit was possible to experience a more expansive and intense state of being inwhich the world became sacred and spiritual again. In other words, unlike thevast majority of people, they sensed that it was possible for them to wake up,both temporarily and permanently. They experienced accidental moments ofawakening, and began to realize that there were certain activities or practicesthat were likely to generate awakening experiences, such as fasting, sleepdeprivation, meditation, or ingesting psychedelic plants or substances. Thesesmall groups of people also began to realize that wakefulness could becultivated as a permanent state, and developed systems of self-development,featuring spiritual practices and lifestyle guidelines, to do this. Theydeveloped what we now know as spiritual traditions. Across Asia, they developedthe traditions of Daoism, Buddhism, Vedanta, and many others. Across the MiddleEast and Europe, they developed the teachings of Sufism, Kabbalah, and mysticalChristianity.In the same way that a landscape can be seen from different vantage points, andevery onlooker may emphasize certain features over others, all of these groupsconceived of the wakeful state in a slightly different way. Because of thevarying traditions and worldviews of their cultures, they all developed slightlydifferent interpretations of what it means to be awake, and how to cultivate thestate.In this chapter, I’ll summarize how the world’s main spiritual traditionsconceive of wakefulness and draw out the common themes behind theirinterpretations. One of the aims of this book is to look at wakefulness as apsychological state, outside the context of spiritual or religious traditions.But here we’ll see how the state appears when it is interpreted in spiritual andreligious terms. By drawing out the common themes, we’ll be able to see the mostimportant features of the fundamental psychological and ontological landscapethat lies behind the different interpretations.Wakefulness in Indian TraditionsOf all cultures in the post-Fall world, ancient India developed the deepestunderstanding of the state of wakefulness and the most sophisticated systems ofself-development in order to attain the state. In the Hindu tradition (leavingaside Buddhism for the moment), this understanding is expressed through textssuch as the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita, and in traditions such as Yoga andTantra. In common with other traditions, Yoga philosophers made a cleardistinction between temporary experiences of awakening and wakefulness as apermanent state. In its temporary form, awakening could occur as savikalpa ornirvikalpa samadhi. Samadhi literally means “ecstasy,” and savikalpa samadhiliterally means “ecstasy tied to a particular form.” This means seeing the worldas the manifestation of spirit, and realizing that we’re part of its oneness andtherefore one with everything in the world. However, in nirvikalpa samadhi theworld of form disappears all together. It dissolves into an ocean of purespirit, which one feels is the ultimate reality of the universe. (This isequivalent to the high-intensity awakening experiences I described in theprevious chapter.) One has the same sense of oneness as savikalpa samadhi butwithout the concept of self. A person doesn’t just become one with the world,they actually become it.However, it’s also possible to live in a permanent, ongoing state of samadhi,called sahaja samadhi. In this state, samadhi becomes integrated into everydaylife. You can live a completely normal human existence — working, eating, andinteracting with other people, even thinking when necessary — and may appear tobe a completely ordinary person. But inside, you have no sense of separateness,and are free of fear and desire. There’s a continual sense of inner stillness,peace, and wholeness. As the Upanishads express it, the individual self — atman— becomes one with the spirit-force that pervades the universe, brahman. Youbecome aware that your essential nature — and the essential nature of allreality — is satchitananda (being-consciousness-bliss). Bliss or joy is thenature of brahman, so union with brahman means experiencing this bliss.The main focus of Hindu spirituality, therefore, is union, which is one possibletranslation of the term yoga. Wakefulness in this tradition is abouttranscending the duality between subject and object, between the individual andthe world. It’s about realizing that, at the essence of your being, you are onewith the whole universe. At the essence of your being is a blissful spiritualenergy, a pure radiant consciousness, that is indestructible and eternal. Thisenergy is also the essence of everything else that exists, and of the wholeuniverse itself. When you experience this, you move beyond sorrow and beyonddeath.Buddhist Concepts of WakefulnessBuddhism grew out of Hindu spirituality but doesn’t have the same emphasis onunion. Rather, Buddhism emphasizes cultivating selflessness and equanimity. InTheravada Buddhism, the earliest Buddhist tradition, it’s difficult to definewakefulness accurately because of the Buddha’s reluctance to discussmetaphysical or philosophical issues. (In one text, the Buddha uses the analogyof a man who has been wounded with a poisoned arrow but refuses to let anyoneremove it until he finds out where the arrow came from, who shot it, what castehe is a member of, and so on. In other words, the paramount thing is to pull outthe arrow, that is, to relieve human suffering; the philosophical ormetaphysical issues are a distraction.) Nirvana literally means a “blowing out”of the flame of life, a state in which you no longer exist as an individual andare free from the craving that keeps you tied to the wheel of rebirth. Nirvanacan be interpreted as a simple state of extinction, in which you become free ofsuffering in the simple sense that you no longer have to be reborn into a worldwhere suffering is the nature of things. Or it can be interpreted in moremystical terms, as a state in which you don’t literally cease to exist but onlycease to exist as a separate entity; the separate self becomes extinct as youbecome one with the whole cosmos.However, in one text, the “Snake-Simile Discourse,” the Buddha goes into detailabout the process of awakening. He describes four different levels ofwakefulness, which involve decreasing self-centeredness and desire andincreasing detachment and equanimity. You become increasingly free from desireand aversion, until at the highest level of wakefulness — that of the arahant,or “fully realized being” — you reach a state of complete mental ease andequanimity, and lose any trace of ego. You live in a state of pure being,without the past or the future, and don’t generate any new karma so that youwill not be reborn. At this point, you are incapable of behaving improperly.Whereas the unawakened person has to make a conscious effort to be moral andvirtuous (through the practice of sila), the fully awakened person is in a stateof effortless morality.In other forms of Buddhism, wakefulness is described more directly. In the laterMahayana tradition, it’s described in terms similar to samadhi, as a recognitionof the “suchness” (or basic reality) of things and an awareness of theirunderlying oneness. Suchness is sometimes associated with the concept of thedharmakaya, which has similarities with brahman. As with brahman, the wholeworld emerges from the dharmakaya and all things are one in it. According to thefamous Japanese Buddhist teacher D. T. Suzuki, enlightenment means therealization of the dharmakaya within oneself and the experience of its“all-embracing love and all-knowing intelligence.”1 [part0027.html#rch2en1]The Mahayana tradition (and Zen, which is the form Mahayana Buddhism took inChina and Japan) views wakefulness as a natural state that is always present,like gold within ore. In other words, awakening is a process of uncovering ourtrue nature. Buddha nature is latent in all beings. It’s an active principlewith a transformative power so that awakening is at least partly a process ofallowing this transformative power to manifest itself.Wakefulness in DaoismIt’s one of the strange synchronicities of history that many of the world’searliest (and still most profound, even today) spiritual and philosophicaltraditions emerged at roughly the same time, apparently independently of eachother. At roughly the same time as Indian figures such as the Buddha andPatanjali (who wrote or compiled the basic teachings of Yoga in the Yoga Sutras)developed their teachings, further west, in ancient Greece, figures such asHeraclitus and Plato were developing the foundations of modern Westernphilosophy. And during the same period, to the east of India, Chinese sages weredeveloping similarly profound teachings, making their own attempts toconceptualize the wakeful state and develop practices to cultivate it.In ancient China, the concept of an all-pervading spiritual principle was calledthe Dao. The Dao (sometimes spelled with a T, as the Tao) is usually translatedas “the way” or “the principle.” It’s the fundamental essence of the universe, aspiritual force that gives rise to all things and that flows through all things;it maintains the balance and order of the universe. As such, it clearly hassimilarities with brahman and the dharmakaya.In Daoism, the spiritual-philosophical tradition that developed around theconcept of the Dao, the term ming is closest to wakefulness. The ancient Daoistsage Chuang-tzu uses this term to describe a state in which you no longerexperience duality and separation, and realize your true nature as the Dao andso become one with it. You “empty yourself out” until you are no longer anindividual; you experience oneness. (Again, there are clear parallels withHinduism here, with its emphasis on union and the transcendence of our apparentseparation from the world.) As Chuang-tzu advocates, “Be empty: that is all. Theperfect man’s use of his mind is like a mirror.”2 [part0027.html#rch2en2] In thestate of ming, your mind is completely still as well as empty. And in thisstate, your life becomes the spontaneous expression of the Dao. You give up yourown will and live in a state of “actionless activity” (wu wei). You still livean active life but don’t act deliberately or with conscious intent. You simplyallow the Dao to act through you.As in Buddhism, the Daoist concept of wakefulness emphasizes equanimity. Whenyou attain union with the Dao, neither positive nor negative events affect you.You have a peaceful, stable self-sufficiency inside you that nothing candisturb. You also lose the fear of death, because the distinction between lifeand death no longer has any meaning, as with other distinctions such as “I” and“you,” and “I” and “the world.”In a more general sense, the great Daoist text, the Dao De Jing (or Tao TeChing) — my own personal favorite of all spiritual texts, along with theUpanishads — describes wakefulness in terms of recapturing the spontaneity,openness, and unself-consciousness of childhood. In a strikingly similar way toJesus advising us to “become like little children,”3 [part0027.html#rch2en3] theDao De Jing advises us to “return to the state of the infant,” and says that theperson who “has in himself abundantly the attributes (of the Dao) is like aninfant.”4 [part0027.html#rch2en4]Wakefulness in Monotheistic ReligionsThe concept of wakefulness is central to Daoist, Buddhist, and Hinduspirituality but it’s less overt in the Abrahamic religions — Judaism,Christianity, and Islam.In The Fall I suggest that the development of monotheistic religions representeda movement into further ego-separateness. When I began to read anthropologicaltexts as part of my research for The Fall, I was surprised to learn that most ofthe world’s primal or indigenous peoples aren’t theistic in the sense weunderstand it. (According to the statistics of the social anthropologist GerhardLenski, for example, only 4 percent of contemporary hunter-gatherer groups havea concept of a “creator god concerned with the moral conduct of humans.”5[part0027.html#rch2en5]) “Unfallen” peoples don’t believe in gods who overseethe world and control its events. Instead, they have concepts of a spirit-forceor energy that pervades the world, and of individual spirits that interact withnatural phenomena. Like gods, spirits can control natural events — they cancause illness, make rain, change the direction of the wind. However, they aren’tconceived as anthropomorphic entities like gods but rather as abstract forces orpowers, almost like vapors.The concept of gods as personal, anthropomorphic beings was a result of theintensified sense of ego. On the one hand, it was a clear sign of howdespiritualized the world had become. The natural world was no longer sacred, asit had been to primal peoples. Now sacredness was confined to specific placessuch as churches or temples, and to specific people such as priests. Now the“divine” was otherworldly, apart from the world rather than within it. At thesame time, the concept of gods was a reaction to the aloneness and unease thathuman beings now experienced. The belief in gods who oversaw the world andcontrolled all its events was a psychological response to insecurity andseparation. It made the world seem a more benign and orderly place, and gavepeople a sense of protection and security. In addition, believing that gods werealways present, watching over them, helped to alleviate people’s sense ofego-isolation or aloneness.The concept of an afterlife associated with these theistic beliefs alsoperformed an important psychological function. Particularly in monotheisticreligions (not so much in polytheistic religions such as those of ancient Greeceor Rome), the afterlife is conceived as an idyllic place, an eternal paradise inwhich we can satisfy all our desires and live in perfect bliss and peace, freefrom the suffering that blights our lives on earth. This concept of theafterlife acted as a consolation for the suffering that filled human life afterthe Fall — not only psychological suffering but also the social suffering ofconstant warfare, oppression, and brutality.In this sense, there was nothing transcendent about monotheistic religions. Theywere a defensive reaction against the intensified sense of ego and itspsychological and social effects. And this is still true. ConventionalChristianity, Islam, and Judaism are conceptual rather than transformative; thatis, they are based on beliefs and conventions of behavior rather thanself-transformation.However, within these cultures there were people who sensed the possibility oftranscending their sleep state. These people — known as mystics — radicallyreinterpreted some of their religions’ teachings in light of their experiencesof wakefulness. They took religions based on consolation and radicallyreenvisioned them as transformational systems.In this sense, wakefulness as it’s expressed in monotheistic religions likeJudaism, Christianity, and Islam takes people beyond those religions. Whenpeople wake up, they lose the sense of being identified with — and the need tobelong to — a particular religious tradition. They begin to feel anall-embracing empathy and compassion that takes them beyond the divisions ofreligious or ethnic groups. As a result, such awakened individuals, even whenthey are affiliated with one particular religion, are usually ecumenical andopen to other faiths. They see all religious and spiritual traditions simply asdifferent paths to the same destination, or different views of the samelandscape. Unlike conventionally religious people, they don’t see theirtradition’s beliefs as “the truth” and try to defend them against opposingviews.Partly because of this, awakened individuals throughout history have had anuneasy relationship with the religious traditions they were affiliated with.Conventional religious leaders struggled to make sense of mystics’ awakenedinterpretations of religious teachings and often viewed them as blasphemous.Whereas conventionally religious people conceive of God as a personal being whooversees the world from another dimension of reality, religious mystics see Godas an immensely powerful and radiant energy that pervades the whole world. Andmost radically, religious mystics don’t see this God as separate fromthemselves. God is the essence of their own being so that, in a sense, they arealso God.Such insights as these inevitably led to conflict with religious authorities andaccusations of heresy. For example, the ninth-century Sufi mystic MansurAl-Hallaj was prone to falling into a trance in which he would declare “I am thetruth.” He also wrote spiritual poetry describing his oneness with God,including lines such as: Thy Spirit is mingled in my spirit, even as wine is mingled with purewater. When anything touches Thee, it touches me too, in every case Thou art I.6[part0027.html#rch2en6]As a result, he was imprisoned for eleven years and finally executed. In theChristian tradition, the great fourteenth-century mystic Meister Eckhart maywell have also been imprisoned and executed, if he hadn’t died of natural causesbefore his trial for heresy began.Wakefulness in the Jewish TraditionIn Judaism, the main mystical tradition is Kabbalah. As with Hindu and Daoistspirituality, the ultimate aim of Kabbalah is union with the divine, or En Sof(literally, “without end”). In the Zohar, the major work of Kabbalah, this stateof union is called devekut — literally translated as “cleaving to the divine” —and described as a state of mental stillness and emptiness, ecstasy and awe.It’s a place of no thought, in which we transcend our normal sense of ego andbecome aware of the harmony and unity of the cosmos, and also our own unity withit.According to the Zohar, the universe and everything in it is pervaded withtranslucent light (in fact, the term Zohar literally means “splendor” or“brilliance”). This radiance is the fundamental reality of the world, but ournormal, limited awareness — that is, our sleep state — denies us access to it.In order to experience it, we have to expand and intensify our awareness; weneed to wake up. Kabbalistic texts recommend a variety of meditative exercisesto do this, including prayer, chanting, visualizing symbols, contemplating theletters of the Hebrew alphabet, and contemplating and visualizing the wonders ofthe universe. They also recommend cultivating an attitude of indiscriminate joy,which creates an opening for the divine to flow through us (as opposed tosadness and depression, which close us off to the divine).7[part0027.html#rch2en7]The depiction of wakefulness in Kabbalah includes a strong altruistic elementthat isn’t so much a part of Hindu, Daoist, or Christian traditions (although itoccurs in Buddhism in the concept of the bodhisattva — the enlightened being whodecides to return to the world rather than step off the wheel of samsara, inorder to help other people become enlightened). The ultimate aim of Kabbalahisn’t so much individual but collective transformation. When a person becomesawakened, their experience effects the whole of humanity, in the same way thatwhen a light is turned on it illuminates the space all around it. Every person’sawakening promotes tikkun olam, the “healing of the world.” In the Zohar, theaim of prayer isn’t merely to bring the adept closer to union with God but alsoto generate joy and peace in the world, which are “brought down” to the worldand spread to all those who are open to it.A different form of Jewish mysticism emerged in the Hasidic tradition, whichoriginated in sixteenth-century Poland. According to Hasidism, God is present ineverything, including the human soul (where God is “the soul of the soul”). Inour normal sleep state, we’re alienated from the divinity inside us; we live ina state of forgetfulness and separation. However, we can awaken to this divinepresence through intense devotion, prayer, and meditation. These spiritualpractices can enable us to transcend time and space and become absorbed into Godso that we become one with the universe.Wakefulness in the Christian TraditionEvelyn Underhill, the great scholar of mysticism, identified five stages ofawakening in the teachings of Christian mystics. The first stage is awakening ofthe self, when the mystic experiences heightened awareness and is aware of adivine energy pervading the world. These glimpses of wakefulness make the mysticpainfully aware of the limits of their normal consciousness and encourage themto go through a second stage, purgation, where they try to transcend theselimits by purifying themselves, living a life of renunciation and self-denial.This leads to the third stage, illumination, where heightened awareness returnsbut is more stable and intense, with a vision of all-pervading divine presenceand an inner joy or ecstasy.8 [part0027.html#rch2en8]For some mystics this is the end point of their development, but for others,according to Underhill, illumination is followed by a fourth stage, the “darknight of the soul.” In this stage of desolation and despair the mystic feelsabandoned by the divine, as if, in Meister Eckhart’s words, “there were a wallerected between Him and us.”9 [part0027.html#rch2en9] They feel spiritually aridand full of self-loathing. However, this dark night is actually a phase offurther purgation, in which the soul empties itself out completely so that itcan experience union with the divine.If the mystic emerges from the dark night, they reach the final stage of themystical path, that of union or deification. Here the mystic doesn’t just seeGod in the world — as in the awakening or illumination stages — but becomes onewith God. The soul becomes one with the ground of reality (or the “Godhead,” asMeister Eckhart calls it) and with the entire cosmos. There’s no longer aseparate “I.” The mystic’s identity now includes the whole world.The concept of union with God is as central to the Christian mystical traditionas it is to Kabbalah and Hasidism. A thirteenth-century Christian mystical textcalled On Cleaving to God even uses the same terminology as the Zohar. Accordingto this text, we, through loving God, can “pour ourselves” into his being andbecome absorbed into it. In other words, our love of God can transform us intoGod. Meister Eckhart also describes how love allows us to “enter into” God andthen enables us to “know Him as He is.”10 [part0027.html#rch2en10] Thesixteenth-century Spanish mystic John of the Cross writes similarly of a stateof “spiritual marriage” with God in which we live in a “dark silence” that is atthe same time “filled with light and heavenly music.”11 [part0027.html#rch2en11]It’s worth emphasizing that these Christian (and Jewish) mystics aren’tdescribing temporary experiences of oneness (although, of course, they describethese, too). Here they are talking about wakefulness as an ongoing, stable stateof being. Again, they are describing a state akin to the Hindu concept of sahajasamadhi, in which a person lives in constant union with the divine throughouttheir everyday life. Evelyn Underhill gives the examples of fifteenth-centuryCatherine of Genoa and sixteenth-century Teresa of Avila, both of whom lived in“unbroken consciousness” of the divine at the same time as living highly activeand productive lives in everyday society. The seventeenth-century French mysticMarie de l’Incarnation gives an excellent description of this state of permanentcontemplation (or sahaja samadhi): “My soul has dwelt in her centre, which isGod. . . . One can read, write, work, do what one will, and nevertheless thisfundamental occupation always abides and the soul never ceases to be united withGod.”12 [part0027.html#rch2en12]Wakefulness in SufismThe goal of Sufism, the mystical tradition of Islam, is also union with God, notjust as a temporary experience but as a permanent state. Fana, usuallytranslated as “passing away,” is the Sufi term for a temporary awakeningexperience in which a person’s identity fades away and dissolves into union withthe world, and nothing remains except divine radiance and oneness. In this way,fana is similar to the Hindu concept of nirvikalpa samadhi. And in the samesense that sahaja samadhi is seen as a permanent, ongoing state of samadhi, inSufism baqa (or “abiding in God”) is a more stable and ongoing variant of fana.The person doesn’t cease to exist but their individuality is absorbed into God,giving them a permanent sense of his being pervading both the world and theirown being.In baqa the mystic no longer has a will of their own but lives in and throughGod in a state of ecstasy. The person no longer has a sense of planning theirown life or making things happen. In this way, there’s a strong similarity withthe state of actionless activity (wu wei) that arises when we live in harmonywith the Dao. Life unfolds naturally and spontaneously by virtue of divinepower. As in Buddhism, there’s a complete lack of desire and ambition, and acomplete indifference to praise or disrespect.Sufism emphasizes altruism and collective awakening, as do the Jewish mysticaltraditions. This differs from Theravada Buddhism, in which awakening effectivelymeans leaving the world behind — becoming free of karma so you don’t have to beborn again. In Sufism, as in Kabbalah, the awakened person has a responsibilityto share their wakefulness with others, to manifest it in the world of time andspace. Their awakening contributes to the awakening of the whole human race.The Core Characteristics of Wakefulness according to the TraditionsIt’s truly remarkable that so many people in different cultures at differenttimes in history had the same insight: it was possible for them to transcendtheir normal state of being, which was limited and constricted, and cultivate amore expansive and intensive state. It’s remarkable that so many differentsystems and paths developed independently as methods of transcending our normalstate of sleep. It’s almost as if, three or four thousand years after the Fallbegan, something was stirring within the collective human psyche — an impulse toawaken. (In The Fall, I refer to this as the First Wave.)The similarities between different spiritual traditions’ conceptions of thestate of wakefulness (and the process of awakening) are so strong that it seemsthat they’re all speaking about the same fundamental state but interpreting andframing it in slightly different ways. Drawing on the analogy I used earlier,they are looking at the same landscape from different vantage points. Forexample, it seems clear that the all-pervading spiritual force — God or theground of reality — described by Jewish, Christian, and Sufi mystics isessentially the same universal spiritual force that Daoists refer to as the Daoand Hindu mystics as brahman. (The Jewish concept of En Sof is practicallyidentical to the Hindu concept of brahman.) This all-pervading spiritual forceis also essentially the same as the concept of spirit-force developed inindigenous cultures, as described in the previous chapter.There are slight differences in the way spiritual traditions conceive of thisforce. For example, the Dao is conceived in dynamic terms, as a flowing forcethat we need to align our lives with. Brahman is more static and neutral — weaim to experience union with it rather than harmonize our lives with it. But theoverall similarity is much more striking than the divergence. Across differenttraditions, this force is described as pervading all things and the spacesbetween all things. It underlies the whole phenomenal world in such a way thatthe phenomenal world may appear to arise from it, as a manifestation of it. Itunifies all things, folds them all into its oneness. In addition, this spiritualforce is frequently depicted as having qualities of radiance and bliss (as inthe Vedantic concept of satchitananda, or being-consciousness-bliss). In theUpanishads and the Bhagavad Gita, brahman is often compared to the sun. Forexample, the Gita states, “If the light of a thousand suns suddenly arose in thesky, that splendour might be compared to the radiance of the Supreme Spirit.”13[part0027.html#rch2en13] We’ve also seen that the term Zohar can be translatedas “splendor” or “brilliance.” And the Zohar itself describes the universe aspervaded with translucent light. Brilliant radiance is a quality of the awakenedperson’s inner self, too — this is the “inner light” of mystical Christianity orthe “light of the atman” in Hinduism. This makes complete sense, of course,since the spiritual essence of the universe is also the essence of our ownbeing.(Interestingly, awakened people may also emit light. There may be an atmosphereof radiance around them that can be sensed and absorbed by other people. Manyreports of encounters with awakened people describe this radiance. For example,when the English author and poet Edward Carpenter visited the spirituallyawakened poet Walt Whitman, he was immediately aware of a “certain radiant powerin him, a large benign effluence and inclusiveness, as of the sun.”14[part0027.html#rch2en14] Similarly, when the British spiritual author PaulBrunton visited the Indian sage Ramana Maharshi he described his awareness of a“spreading ripple of telepathic radiation from this mysterious and imperturbableman.”15 [part0027.html#rch2en15])Just as traditions conceive of an all-pervading spiritual force in slightlydifferent ways, it’s easy to see their different concepts of wakefulness —sahaja samadhi, enlightenment, ming, devekut, union with the divine, baqa — asslightly different interpretations of the same essential state of being. If wecompare their descriptions of the characteristics of wakefulness, we see thesame themes emerging again and again, although with different degrees ofemphasis. The same themes emerging across different traditions suggests thatthey are the main characteristics of wakefulness itself, as it exists beforeinterpretation. Using the landscape analogy again, if the same features reoccurin every description of a lake from a different viewpoint, we can assume thatthey genuinely exist as inherent features of that lake. If just one person saidthat a mountain was purple, we may be doubtful, but if all the viewers said itwas purple then we may be inclined to believe them.So what are the core characteristics of the wakeful state according to thespiritual traditions we’ve looked at?Perhaps the strongest theme is union. Wakefulness is a state in which we movebeyond separateness and into connection and union. Most importantly, wakefulnessmeans connecting with the spiritual essence of the universe — whether we call itbrahman, the Dao, or God — and with the deepest part of ourselves. The universalessence is also the essence of our own being.The biggest obstacle to this connection (both to the spiritual essence of theuniverse and to our own being) is our powerful sense of ego, with all itsdesires, ambitions, and attachments. The ego’s strong boundaries enclose uswithin our own mental space; it separates us from the world. Therefore, we mustweaken this self, soften its solid boundaries, so that we can transcendseparateness and connect with spirit. (The traditions describe this process asself-annihilation and self-naughting.) Our senses of gravity and identity haveto shift away from our narrow personal self and become part of a wider anddeeper expanse of being.A second characteristic of wakefulness highlighted by all the traditions we’veexamined is inner stillness, or inner emptiness. Awakened individuals don’t havebusy, chattering minds and aren’t assailed by turbulent emotions and desires.They are peaceful inside; their consciousness is pure and calm, like a lake.In fact, all traditions agree that developing inner stillness is an essentialpart of the process of awakening. In other words, if you want to wake up, youhave to learn to slow down and calm your mind, and transcend the layers ofthought and emotion that cloud your consciousness. Regular meditation isimportant for this reason, among others. By meditating you may come to realizethat you’re not your thoughts and make contact with deeper, more spacious layersof your being beyond thought. Meister Eckhart describes “the storm of inwardthought” that normally plagues our minds, and writes that “if God is to speakhis word in the soul, she must be at rest and at peace.”16[part0027.html#rch2en16] Similarly, the Maitri Upanishad describes how, “Whenthe mind is silent . . . it can enter into a world which is far beyond the mind:the highest End.”17 [part0027.html#rch2en17]A third characteristic of the wakeful state across all traditions isself-sufficiency. Awakened individuals have little or no concern for worldsuccess, possession, or personal ambition and are unaffected by praise, blame,or humiliation; they have no need for other people’s approval. They don’t needto add anything to themselves such as success, status, or wealth because theyalready feel whole. The Buddhist Heart Sutra clearly summarizes this: “In theirindifference to personal attainment, and their lack of desire forself-justification, enlightened men and women can never be humiliated or upsetby others.”18 [part0027.html#rch2en18] The Bhagavad Gita describes the awakenedperson as being “the same in pleasure and pain; to whom gold or stones or earthare one, and what is pleasing or displeasing leaves him in peace.”19[part0027.html#rch2en19]However, this lack of concern for other people’s opinions of them doesn’t meanthat awakened individuals have no concern for other people. On the contrary,their lack of self-interest and their increased sense of connection leads to afourth characteristic of the wakeful state across spiritual traditions: a highdegree of compassion and altruism. At the same time as connecting with thespiritual essence of the world and with their own essence, awakened individualsconnect strongly with other human beings. They have a strong capacity forempathy, an ability to feel with other people. They can sense other people’ssuffering, frustration, and pain, which gives rise to an altruistic impulse toalleviate their suffering or aid their development. Partly because their ownambitions and desires are no longer important to them, they feel a strongimpulse to serve others, and to practice kindness and generosity. This spirit ofaltruism is clearly expressed by the seventh-century Buddhist monk Shantideva,who writes: “I wish to remove the suffering of every living being, enabling allto move towards enlightenment. . . . My concern for the welfare of others gainsme greater merit than any act of worship.”20 [part0027.html#rch2en20]Ultimately, this compassionate attitude stems from an awareness that spirit ispresent in everyone so that, in a sense, we are everyone else. Therefore, whenother people suffer, we suffer ourselves. As the sixteenth-century Jewish mysticMoses Cordovero states, “Whoever sins injures not only himself but also thatpart of himself which belongs to another.” In this way, it’s important to loveothers because “the other is really oneself.”21 [part0027.html#rch2en21]A fifth common theme of wakefulness among spiritual traditions (related to thefirst theme of union) is the relinquishing of personal agency. In other words,awakening means losing the sense that you are directing your own life andfollowing your own ambitions or plans. Instead, your life becomes the expressionof something greater than you, of a force that is flowing through you. This isthe Daoist idea of wu wei — actionless activity — when we realize that the Daois our nature and everything we do is the natural expression of it. Inmonotheistic spiritual traditions, the mystic gives up their own personal willso that they can live through God — or so that God can live through them. InKabbalah, for instance, a person’s individual will has to be “raised” until itbecomes one with En Sof, the divine principle that both pervades and transcendsthe world. When we align our personal will with God’s will, we become agents ofthat divine will. A powerful, transformational energy begins to flow through uswith which we can help heal the world.Let me end by briefly highlighting two other clear — and in some ways obvious —themes. The first of these is that wakefulness brings a more intense andcomplete awareness of reality. The world as we perceive it in ordinaryconsciousness is only a limited, shadow reality. As the Greek philosopher Platoexpressed it, we’re sitting in a cave, staring at the shadows on the wall infront of us, while the real world passes behind us. In reality, the world isn’tmundane and meaningless but radiant with meaning and harmony. In reality,there’s oneness rather than separation. In Indian Vedantic terms, the illusionof maya (deception) is uncovered, revealing a world of unity in place of anillusory world of duality and separateness. Or in the words of theeleventh-century Sufi mystic Al-Ghazali, this is a state “whose relation to yourwaking consciousness is analogous to the relation of the latter to dreaming. Incomparison with this state your waking consciousness would be like dreaming!”22[part0027.html#rch2en22]Finally, and perhaps most obviously, wakefulness is seen across traditions as astate of intense well-being. Every tradition agrees that to wake up means totranscend anxiety and fear and attain a sense of great serenity and bliss. InBuddhism, bodhi entails a cessation of suffering. In Daoism, ming means livingwith spontaneous ease. In Indian Vedanta, bliss is one of the qualities ofconsciousness itself, as in satchitananda (being-consciousness-bliss). Theessence of brahman is joy: “Brahman is joy: for from joy all beings have come,by joy they all live, and unto joy they all return.”23 [part0027.html#rch2en23]So self-realization is literally an awakening into bliss. Similarly, in Jewishspirituality, devekut is a state of joy and exaltation, as is the Sufi state ofbaqa.The Perennial PsychologyIt’s fascinating that there are such close similarities between spiritualtraditions — especially when the religions associated with them create so muchdivision and conflict between them. It’s tempting to suggest that the mystics ofJudaism, Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, and Hinduism have much more in commonwith each other than they do with the mainstream followers of their religions.(A Christian monk I’m friendly with once told me that he felt much morecomfortable talking to Buddhist monks than he did talking to born-againChristians.) Mystics from all traditions have the common aim of cultivatingwakefulness, while the common aim of all mainstream religions is to offerconsolation and psychological support. To use a medical analogy, while mysticstry to heal themselves (that is, to transcend sleep), conventionally religiouspeople simply try to manage the symptoms.Near-death experiences are a good analogy to show the similarities betweendifferent traditions. It’s common for people who “die” for a short time inmedical emergencies (most frequently a heart attack or cardiac arrest) toexperience a continuation of consciousness, even though their bodies and brainsshow no sign of activity. Researchers have found a number of corecharacteristics of near-death experience, including a sense of leaving one’sbody, traveling through darkness toward a place of light, meeting “wise” beingsor deceased relatives, and so on. However, the experience is often interpretedin slightly different ways by people in different cultures. For example, when aHindu person has a near-death experience they may believe that they’veencountered Krishna, but when a Christian has the experience they may believethat they’ve experienced heaven and the presence of Jesus.The same seems to be true of the wakeful state. The core state of wakefulness isinterpreted in slightly different ways by people from different spiritual orreligious traditions. The phrase perennial philosophy is sometimes used to referto the common core of the world’s religious and spiritual traditions, butperhaps it would be accurate (as the philosopher Ken Wilber suggests) to use theterm perennial psychology. After all, the wakeful state isn’t so much a way ofthinking about the world (as the term philosophy suggests) but a way ofexperiencing it. It’s a particular state of being that human beings in allcultures have experienced and which, in theory, is possible for all human beingsto experience.24 [part0027.html#rch2en24]By looking at the main themes of this state across different spiritualtraditions we’ve hopefully gone some way to uncovering the essentialpsychological landscape of the state. It will be interesting to test thesethemes against the characteristics of the experiences of secular wakefulness,which we’re going to look at in the following chapters, to make sure that we’redealing with the same essential experience.Now, however, we’re going to turn to the process of awakening and investigatehow it occurs."},{"pageContent":"3. Natural Wakefulness: Awakened Artists [part0005.html#rch3]There are three different ways in which wakefulness can occur. First, it mayoccur naturally. A person may simply be awake as their normal condition. Second,wakefulness can develop gradually over a long period of time, usually as aresult of regular spiritual practice or adherence to a particular spiritualpath. (For example, a Buddhist or Christian monk may gradually awaken as aresult of following a lifestyle of self-discipline, meditation, silence, andsolitude. A person who doesn’t follow a particular spiritual path but regularlypractices meditation and yoga — perhaps twice a day — may also graduallyawaken.) And third, wakefulness may occur suddenly and dramatically, usually inresponse to intense psychological turmoil.In the following two chapters, we’re going to look at the first of these threeways: natural wakefulness. Before this, however, I’d like to clarify exactlywhat happens when a person becomes awakened. That is, I’d like to look in moredetail at the steps involved in the process of shifting from a normal state to awakeful state.The Wakeful Self-SystemOne term that is important to understand in relation to the process of awakeningis self-system. The self-system is largely equivalent to the term mind. It iseverything that creates and constitutes who we think we are. It includes oursense of identity, with all the memories, beliefs, concepts, attitudes, andpsychological attachments that inform it. The self-system also performspsychological functions such as concentration, information processing,cognition, and so on.This self-system is an aspect of our being, but not our whole being. Theself-system exists within the open space of our whole spirit or essence, whichis an influx of the essential spiritual reality of the universe. Our spirit is,in Indian Upanishadic terms, the atman, the individual spiritual self, thatstems from brahman, the all-pervading spiritual energy. It has a radiant,blissful nature that we experience in moments of stillness, when our self-systembecomes inactive and its boundaries soften.Normally, though, our self-system has strong boundaries. It separates itselffrom the rest of our being (and the rest of the cosmos outside us), like a citysurrounded by walls that sees itself as an autonomous, self-sufficientsettlement. The most prominent aspect of our normal self-system is the ego. Theego is the center of our identity and our individuality, the organizing centerof the self. It generates a constant stream of thoughts and associations.Because it’s so powerful and active, it uses up most of the energy of ourself-system — and even of our whole being.All of the characteristics of the sleep state that we examined in chapter 1[part0008.html#7K4G0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5] are produced by thisself-system, with its strong boundaries and incessant thought-chatter: the senseof separation and lack; inner discord and discontent; automatized perception; anarrow, egocentric outlook; materialistic and self-seeking values; and so on.The wakeful state also has a kind of self-system, but a very different one thanthe sleep state. It’s more subtle and unobtrusive, and its boundaries are muchsofter (and may not even exist) so that it isn’t separate from the whole of ourbeing. Revisiting the city analogy, it’s more like an eco-town that is so wellintegrated into the landscape as a whole that it’s difficult to tell where itends and the countryside begins. As a result, this self-system is always filledwith the energy of our expanded being. This radiant spiritual energy — with itsnatural quality of well-being — pervades our being like fresh country air, sothat there’s always a sense of energetic well-being.This self-system still has an organizing center with a sense of identity but,again, this is much less obtrusive, much softer, and less active than in theself-system of sleep. It doesn’t continually chatter away to itself and doesn’tuse up nearly as much energy. Again using the analogy of a city, you couldcompare the ego of our normal self-system to an emperor who lives in the centerof the city, with a giant palace and government buildings. The ego-emperor ishalf-mad and continually jabbers away to himself; he selfishly uses up most ofhis people’s wealth and resources. The wakeful self-system doesn’t have anemperor but rather a simple administrator or executor who simply does what hasto be done without claiming any authority.So awakening can be seen as a shift from our normal self-system into a wakefulself-system that is so subtle and labile that we might not even sense that it’sthere at all. (This is why wakefulness is sometimes — mistakenly, I believe —seen as a state of complete no-self.)The three different ways in which wakefulness occurs can be interpreted in termsof this shift from one self-system to another. Wakefulness that occursgradually, through adherence to spiritual practices and paths, involvesgradually reshaping our self-system until the strong boundaries and the powerfulego of our normal self-system have faded away. But sometimes, as we’ll see, theshift from one self-system to the other can happen suddenly and dramatically.The old self-system may suddenly collapse — usually as the result of intensepsychological turmoil — and a new one may emerge to replace it, like a butterflyemerging from a chrysalis.Finally, a small proportion of people may not need to undergo a shift, eithergradual or permanent, because the wakeful self-system is normal and natural tothem. We’ll now examine some of these people.Natural WakefulnessSleep is the normal state for most human beings. Although as young children wenaturally have some of the characteristics of the wakeful state (a topic thatwe’ll investigate in more detail later), by the time most of us reach adulthoodour state of being has become more constricted and our perception has becomeless intense. If we intuit that we’re asleep and feel an impulse to wake up —that is, to expand and intensify our awareness — we have to work at it. We haveto follow practices and a lifestyle that facilitate awakening by undoing some ofthe psychological structures and processes that generate our sleep state.However, a very small number of people don’t need to try to wake up because theynever fell asleep.Those who are spontaneously awake are perhaps the smallest group of awakenedpeople. Their wakefulness isn’t caused by an event or any practice, it simplyis. Like other people, they undergo a process of psychological development asthey move from childhood to adulthood, but their process is different. Theydevelop the different kind of self-system I’ve just described, one without asense of individuality and separateness, and with very soft and fluidboundaries, if any at all. As a result, they experience interconnection with therest of the world and other beings. Although they still have thoughts, theirthought processes are less chaotic and random. Their minds are quieter thanother people’s, and they aren’t as immersed in or identified with theirthoughts. They sense that their true identity is a strong and stable witness whostands apart from the thinking mind and from the negative and positive events ofeveryday life. In the words of Walt Whitman, “Apart from the pulling and haulingstands what I am. . . Both in and out of the game, and watching and wondering atit.”1 [part0027.html#rch3en1]Naturally wakeful people don’t seem to develop the automatic, familiarizedperception that most of us experience as we become adults. This is because theirweaker ego-center consumes much less energy. As a result, their perceptiondoesn’t have to become automatic as a way of conserving energy. Naturallywakeful people retain the vivid and fresh perception of children. To them theworld never loses its powerful is-ness and beauty, and life itself never losesits sense of strangeness and wonder.It’s not quite true, though, to say that naturally wakeful people remain aschildren. They usually develop the same mature psychological abilities as otheradults: to think logically and abstractly, control their attention, control andoverride narcissistic or unreasonable desires, organize, plan and makedecisions, and so on. But while most people develop these abilities and lose theconnectedness and heightened awareness of childhood, spontaneously wakefulpeople develop the abilities and retain the wakeful characteristics ofchildhood.Awakened ArtistsMany naturally wakeful people don’t become known in a spiritual context. Theyusually don’t establish themselves as spiritual teachers. They may investigatedifferent teachings as a way of making sense of their own experiences and later,once they understand their own wakefulness, feel a particular kinship withdifferent teachings and traditions that resonate most deeply with their ownexperiences. However, they usually don’t follow specific spiritual paths orbecome affiliated with particular traditions. Some of them may not even be awareof spiritual traditions at all, at least initially.This lack of affiliation with spiritual traditions might seem strange, until youconsider that the main purpose of spiritual paths is to facilitate spiritualawakening. If someone is already awakened, the path is unnecessary. In the raftparable, the Buddha compares his own teachings to a raft that helps a personcross a lake. Once the person has reached the other shore, the Buddha asks,would they continue to carry the raft over their head while they walked?Obviously not — they would put it down and leave it on the lake shore. In otherwords, once the person has awakened, the Buddha’s teachings are no longernecessary. So in the same sense, a naturally wakeful person has no need forspiritual practices that are intended to awaken them.People who are spontaneously awake are more likely to become creative artiststhan spiritual teachers. Spiritual wakefulness and creativity, particularlypoetry and painting, are closely connected. The wakeful state seems to lenditself to poetic or visual expression. As I’ve suggested elsewhere (in theafterword to my book of poems, The Meaning), it’s as if poetry is the out-breathof spiritual experience. That is, the impulse that awakened people feel toexpress their insights or describe their experiences often takes on a poeticform — not necessarily poetry itself but a poetic type of writing. Normal proseseems to be too mundane and restrictive to describe the wakeful state. Afterall, everyday language is based on duality between subject and object, anddifferent tenses of time — all of which become unimportant (and even illusory)in the wakeful state. But poetic writing isn’t constrained by these limits. It’smore flexible and allusive and so can convey insights and experiences beyondnormal consciousness. This is why so many of the world’s great spiritual textssuch as the Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, and Dao De Jing are written in a poeticform.I’ll begin by discussing two examples of naturally wakeful people from the fieldof literature.Walt WhitmanTo my knowledge, the first ever psychological study of the wakeful state wasconducted by Canadian psychiatrist Richard M. Bucke and published as CosmicConsciousness: A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind in 1901. Buckegathered thirty-six examples of people he believed had attained “cosmicconsciousness,” including historical figures, such as the Buddha, Moses, Jesus,Dante, and eighteenth-century Swedish philosopher Emanuel Swedenborg, and anumber of contemporaries, some of whom he knew personally. The maincharacteristics of cosmic consciousness as identified by Bucke are joyfulness; arevelation of the meaning, purpose, and aliveness of the universe; a sense ofimmortality; a loss of fear of death; and an absence of the concept of sin.Bucke also highlights the importance of light. Cosmic consciousness may featurean experience of being “immersed in a flame or rose-coloured cloud, or perhapsrather a sense that the mind is itself filled with such a cloud or haze.”2[part0027.html#rch3en2]Bucke suggests that there are different degrees of cosmic consciousness, similarto the Buddha’s different levels of enlightenment and Evelyn Underhill’sdifferent stages of the Christian mystical path (and also to my suggestion thatthere are different degrees of wakefulness). One cosmically conscious person maynot be “lifted so very much above ordinary humanity,” while another may be sofar beyond ordinary consciousness that they are effectively “a God.”3[part0027.html#rch3en3] Bucke also recognizes that awakening to cosmicconsciousness may initially bring some confusion. Some people may find itdifficult to understand their new state and wonder if they have become deludedor even insane. However, Bucke notes that this period of doubt is onlytemporary. People quickly become convinced by the revelatory quality of theirexperience. They recognize that they are aware of a more intense and expansivereality than before, one that is more real rather than a distortion of reality.Interestingly, Bucke adds a few other characteristics that aren’t mentioned byspiritual traditions. For example, he believes age is a factor, that the onsetof cosmic consciousness occurs between the ages of thirty and forty. He alsobelieves — controversially and falsely — that cosmic consciousness is morelikely to happen to men than women. He also mentions that cosmic consciousnessbrings “added charm to the personality — so that men and women become stronglyattracted to the person,” and also that it brings “a change in the appearance”or “transfiguration.”4 [part0027.html#rch3en4]Bucke’s interest in cosmic consciousness was inspired by two factors. First, hehad a powerful temporary awakening experience when he was thirty-five years old.He had spent the evening reading poetry with friends and was on his way home ina horse-drawn cab when he experienced, in his words, “a sense of exultation, ofimmense joyousness, accompanied or immediately followed by an intellectualillumination quite impossible to describe,” and he became aware that “the Cosmosis not dead matter but a living presence; that the soul of man is immortal.”5[part0027.html#rch3en5]Second, Bucke was inspired by the American poet Walt Whitman — initially by hispoetry and then by his personal encounters with Whitman. Bucke not only includedWhitman in his book as an example of cosmic consciousness but also regarded himas the “highest instance of Cosmic Consciousness” (above the Buddha, Moses, andJesus). In Bucke’s view, Whitman was able to integrate his mysticalconsciousness into his ordinary personality without allowing it to take over and“tyrannize over the rest.”6 [part0027.html#rch3en6] This meant that he couldlive in a completely ordinary way, interacting with ordinary people in everydaylife, rather than become otherworldly and detached, and live as a monk orhermit.Although the details of his early life are sketchy, there are no signs thatWhitman became awakened at a specific point in time. No events stand out aspossible triggers of an awakening. As we’ll see, sudden awakening is oftentriggered by a period of intense psychological turmoil, but there’s no evidencethat Whitman went through such turmoil in his early life. Whitman’s wakefulnesswas not generated by prolonged and regular spiritual practice either or byfollowing a particular spiritual tradition. Eastern spiritual traditions andpractices were little known in the United States during Whitman’s early years —he was born in 1819. In his later years, Whitman developed some familiarity withIndian philosophy but not any deep or detailed knowledge. (For example, when hiscontemporary Henry David Thoreau first read Whitman’s Leaves of Grass, he wasdeeply impressed and said it was “wonderfully like the orientals.” Thoreau askedWhitman if he had read oriental works, and he replied, “No, tell me aboutthem.”7 [part0027.html#rch3en7]) Rather, Whitman’s wakefulness seems to havebeen completely organic and spontaneous, a state that was wholly natural to him.Whitman lived in a state of heightened awareness. To him, the world was afantastically real, beautiful, and fascinating place. As Bucke writes of him:“His favourite occupation seemed to be strolling or sauntering about outdoors byhimself, looking at the grass, the trees, the flowers, the vistas of light, thevarying aspects of the sky, and listening to the birds, the crickets, the treefrogs, and all the hundreds of natural sounds. It was evident that these thingsgave him a pleasure far beyond what they give to ordinary people.”8[part0027.html#rch3en8]With this heightened awareness, Whitman sensed the sacred aliveness of the worldand the radiance and harmony of a spirit-force pervading every object andcreature. The whole world was divine, including his own being and body. As hewrites in “Song of Myself”: Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch. . . . . . . . . . . . I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each momentthen, In the faces of the men and women I see God, and in my own face in theglass.9 [part0027.html#rch3en9]As well as bring an intense sense of the is-ness of things, the heightenedawareness of the wakeful state brings an intense sense of now-ness. Ourpresent-tense experience — our awareness of our surroundings, perceptions, andsensations — becomes so powerful that we give complete attention to it. The pastand future become completely unimportant as we realize that there’s only now,that life can only ever take place in the present moment. As a result, the wholeconcept of time becomes meaningless. Life is no longer a road with directionsforward and backward; instead, it becomes a spacious panorama without movementor sequence. In Whitman’s words, “The past and present wilt — I have filledthem, emptied them.”10 [part0027.html#rch3en10] And here he describes hisintense experience of now-ness: I have heard the talkers were talking . . . they talk of the beginningand end, But I do not talk of beginning or end. There was never any more inception than there is now, Nor any more youth or age than there is now; And will never be any more perfection than there is now, Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.11 [part0027.html#rch3en11]Whitman’s awareness of a spirit-force pervading everything meant that to himthere were no separate or independent phenomena. To him, all things were part ofa greater unity. In his poem “On the Beach at Night, Alone,” for example, hedescribes his awareness that all things are part of a “vast similitude.” Allsuns, planets, human beings, animals, plants, all of the future and the past,and all of space are essentially one and the same: This vast similitude spans them, and always has spann’d, and shall forever span them, and compactly hold them, and enclose them.12[part0027.html#rch3en12]Whitman sensed himself as a part of this “vast similitude,” too. He felt such astrong connection between himself and other people that he shared his being withthem; he felt that he actually was them. He writes, “I am of old and young, ofthe foolish as much as the wise,” and “all the men ever born are my brothers. .. and the women my sisters and lovers.”13 [part0027.html#rch3en13]Interestingly, as well as being recognized by Bucke as an example of cosmicconsciousness, Whitman is highlighted by the psychologist Abraham Maslow as anexample of what he calls the “self-actualized person.” (Maslow offers MahatmaGandhi, twentieth-century author Aldous Huxley, and the early psychologistWilliam James as other examples.) Maslow uses the concept of self-actualizationwith roughly the same meaning as wakefulness. He describes self-actualizedindividuals as being largely free of negative thoughts or feelings and lessmaterialistic and self-centered (and therefore more altruistic) than otherpeople. Maslow suggests that they have a greater than normal need for peace andsolitude, a sense of duty or mission beyond their own personal ambitions, and astrong sense of the interconnectedness of phenomena (including themselves). Oneof their most pronounced characteristics, according to Maslow, is a powerfulsense of appreciation and gratitude. As Maslow writes, self-actualized people“have the wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively,the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder and even ecstasy, howeverstale these experiences may have become to others.”14 [part0027.html#rch3en14]This was certainly true of Walt Whitman. When we hear the word miracle weusually think in terms of extraordinary feats such as healing incurable diseasesor turning water into wine. But in the wakeful state, we don’t need to lookoutside the normal realm of things for miracles. Miracles are everywhere aroundus. The everyday world becomes strange and miraculous. As Whitman writes, Who makes much of a miracle? As for me I know nothing but miracles.It’s wonderful that he should be immortal, he writes, but “my eyesight isequally wonderful, and how I was conceived in my mother’s womb is equallywonderful.” But as far as he’s concerned, nothing is more miraculous than hehimself: “Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me isa miracle.”15 [part0027.html#rch3en15]Whitman’s joyous celebration of life by no means meant ignoring death. On thecontrary, the subject of death crops up again and again throughout his poems,right from the first pages of “Song of Myself” (where he says that it is “justas lucky to die” as it is to be born). Whitman sensed very powerfully thatrather than be the end of our existence, death is actually a kind of liberation,a transition to a fuller and more blissful state. Like his fellow poet WilliamWordsworth sensing “intimations of immortality,” Whitman heard “whispers ofheavenly death” everywhere around him. In a moving short poem, “To One Shortlyto Die,” Whitman describes visiting a friend on his deathbed. The bed issurrounded by weeping relatives, but as Whitman rests his hand on his friend hesenses that he is preparing to leave his body and beginning to transcend hispain. It’s not a time for sadness but for joy: Strong thoughts fill you and confidence, you smile, You forget you are sick, as I forget you are sick. You do not see the medicines, you do not mind the weeping friends, I amwith you, I exclude others from you, there is nothing to be commiserated, I do not commiserate, I congratulate you.16 [part0027.html#rch3en16]When I read Whitman’s poetry, I find so many beautiful and profound descriptionsof the wakeful state that I’m tempted to agree with Richard M. Bucke and see the“great, gray poet” as an example of a very high intensity of wakefulness thatvery few other human beings have ever attained. In Whitman the characteristicsof the wakeful state are expressed intensely and purely. When I read “Song ofMyself,” for example, I don’t interpret it as poetry in the conventional sensebut as a great spiritual text written in poetic form. To me this poem inparticular stands along with the Upanishads and the Dao De Jing as one of themost profound and powerful spiritual texts in human history. In fact, as much asI admire those two ancient texts, Whitman’s work is even more powerful becauseof the way it embraces the whole of human life and shows the spirit-forcepouring through the minutiae of the everyday world. The Upanishads tell us thatall is spirit, that we’re one with the universe and that the soul is deathless,but Whitman shows it. Brahman shines through the countless ordinary people —craftsmen, soldiers, sailors, even prostitutes — Whitman describes meeting. Heportrays a giant canvas of human life — including sex, friendship, business, andeven warfare and illness — filled with a powerful underlying divinity andsacredness.Certainly, though, the overriding impression we receive from Whitman’s poetry isvery similar to the Upanishads, since they’re both so full of dazzling spiritualradiance and so deeply pervaded with joy. Like the authors of the Upanishads,Whitman tells us clearly that, far from being absurd and meaningless (as itsometimes might appear from the standpoint of our sleep state), life ismiraculous and wonderful; the whole universe is imbued with sentient bliss andharmony, even if we might not be able to explain or understand it fully. As hewrites toward the end of “Song of Myself”: Do you see, O my brothers and sisters? It is not chaos or death — it is form, union, plan — it is eternal life —it is Happiness.17 [part0027.html#rch3en17]D. H. LawrenceThe British author D. H. Lawrence — who was born in 1885, while Whitman wasstill alive — was a great admirer of Walt Whitman, calling him “the greatest andthe first and the only American teacher.”18 [part0027.html#rch3en18] Herecognized Whitman as a kindred spirit, someone who shared the same intensifiedvision of the world as he did. I discussed Lawrence’s wakefulness briefly in mybook Out of the Darkness, but this is a good place to explore it in a littlemore detail.In some ways, Lawrence is a clearer example of natural wakefulness than Whitmanbecause his life is so well documented. He wasn’t widely read — or widelyrespected by literary critics or other authors — during his lifetime, butLawrence’s reputation grew during the 1950s and 1960s. He became one of the mostpopular authors of the twentieth century and was the subject of countlessbiographies and critical studies. As with Whitman’s, Lawrence’s wakefulnesswasn’t triggered by a particular event and didn’t develop gradually due toadherence to spiritual practice or a tradition. Lawrence became aware of Easternphilosophies later in life and felt particularly attracted to Hinduspirituality. For example, he admired a book he read on Kashmiri Shaivism (anIndian Tantric tradition) as “true psychology” that made Western psychology seem“shallow and groping.”19 [part0027.html#rch3en19] However, he certainly wasn’taware of Eastern spirituality when his natural wakefulness began to expressitself in early adulthood.Lawrence began to publish poems, stories, and novels in his early twenties. Fromthe start, his work was characterized by his heightened awareness and his strongsense of connection to the natural world, including animals. Many of Lawrence’sfriends were amazed by his alertness and sensitivity; they described him almostas if he was a different type of human being. One close friend, the literarycritic John Middleton Murry, describes Lawrence as possessing a kind of “sixthsense.” Another, the author Aldous Huxley, describes him as a person who wassomehow “of another order, more sensitive, more highly conscious, more capableof feeling than even the most gifted of common men. . . he inhabited a differentuniverse from that of common men — a brighter and intenser world.”20[part0027.html#rch3en20]Lawrence died at the age of forty-four but was amazingly prolific in his shortlife. He wrote forty-five books in a wide variety of genres — fiction, travel,psychology, philosophy, and literary criticism. He was also a painter andproduced hundreds of canvases. (Unfortunately, the only exhibition of hispaintings he held in his lifetime, in London in 1929, was shut down by policebecause of its allegedly obscene content.) Of course, he’s most famous for hisnovels, including two of the most beautiful novels in English literature, TheRainbow and Women in Love. However, Lawrence’s wakeful experience of the worldexpresses itself most clearly in his poems.In his poetry, Lawrence frequently uses the word god, but his concept of God haslittle to do with the personal father-figure God of conventional religion. Hisgod is brahman, the spirit-force that pervades the universe. To him the world isdivine, shining brilliantly with spirit. “All the time I see the gods,” hewrites in his poem “Name the Gods,” describing how a man mowing a field of wheatrepresents to him “the swaying body of God.”21 [part0027.html#rch3en21] Inanother poem, he writes: There is no god apart from poppies and the flying fish, men singing songs and women brushing their hair in the sun. The lovely things are god that has come to pass.22[part0027.html#rch3en22]Lawrence senses this spirit-force everywhere around him and inside him, too —it’s “the presence which makes the air so still and lovely to me” and which“softly touches the sides of my breast and touches me over the heart.”23[part0027.html#rch3en23] He knows that the only true fulfillment is to feel ouroneness with this divine force. As he writes in one of his most beautiful poems,“Pax”: All that matters is to be at one with the living God to be a creature in the house of the God of Life. Like a cat asleep on a chair at peace, in peace and at one with the master of the house, with the mistress, at home, at home in the house of the living, sleeping on the hearth, and yawning before the fire.24[part0027.html#rch3en24]Lawrence saw the world as pervaded with the spirit-force so to him there was nosuch thing as inanimate matter. All things — even rocks, clouds, and stars —were gloriously alive and sentient. Like Whitman, Lawrence was free of the senseof separateness that is such a strong feature of our sleep state. This meantthat he was able to enter into the being of other creatures (including humanbeings) and experience the world as they did. This is one of the mostexhilarating qualities of his writing — his ability to convincingly depict theinner life not only of human beings but also of animals. At times his sense ofconnection and empathy was so powerful that it was almost as if Lawrenceactually became other beings. As Huxley writes, “He seemed to know, by personalexperience, what it was like to be a tree or a daisy or a breaking wave or eventhe mysterious moon itself.”25 [part0027.html#rch3en25]Natural wakefulness, and wakefulness in general, isn’t static. That is, aperson’s wakefulness doesn’t simply emerge and then remain in the same form forthe rest of their life. Wakefulness evolves. It may deepen and intensify.Different aspects of the state may unfold, and different characteristics maybecome more or less prominent. It’s not the end of a journey but a differentjourney. It’s like shifting onto a different road — moving from the low road tothe high road, you might say. It’s a different road with a different landscapebut it’s still a type of journey involving movement and progression.D. H. Lawrence was always naturally awake but his wakefulness intensified,particularly during the last few years of his life. In Out of the Darkness, Isuggest that his close encounters with death caused this intensification.Lawrence suffered from ill health almost from birth and came very close to deathat least three times as an adult. First, he caught pneumonia at the age oftwenty-six. Second, he caught Spanish flu in 1919 in the epidemic that killedmillions of people after the First World War. Third, he caught malaria, typhoid,and then pneumonia in 1935 when he was living in Mexico. By this time, he wasseriously ill with tuberculosis, which killed him five years later. However, itwas during this final period of his life, when he was slowly dying, that hiswakefulness became most intense, as described in the profound spiritual poems hewrote during this time (published after his death as Last Poems).In some of the most moving of these poems, Lawrence describes facing theprospect of his own death with serene acceptance. He isn’t afraid because, likeWhitman, he intuits that death is a transition rather than an end point, thebeginning of a new journey. In his poem “Gladness of Death” he describes deathas a “great adventure” that is full of “an after-gladness, a strange joy.”26[part0027.html#rch3en26]Other Awakened ArtistsThe nineteenth-century nature writer Richard Jefferies is one lesser-knownauthor who was naturally wakeful to a high degree. His autobiography, The Storyof My Heart, is an amazing description of how the world appears in an intenselywakeful state. Jefferies describes how he was “no more than eighteen when aninner and esoteric meaning began to come to me from all the visible universe,and indefinable aspirations filled me.”27 [part0027.html#rch3en27] Everythingaround him seemed to “burn” with this meaning, and — as with Lawrence andWhitman — the world was a strange and miraculous place to him:As I write these words. . . I feel that the whole air, the sunshine out yonderlighting up the ploughed earth, the distant sky, the circumambient ether, andthat far space, is full of soul-secrets, soul-life, things outside theexperience of all ages. The fact of my own existence as I write, as I exist atthis second, is so marvellous, so miracle-like . . . that I unhesitatinglyconclude that I am always on the margin of life illimitable, and that there arehigher conditions than existence.28 [part0027.html#rch3en28]The English poet William Wordsworth was also naturally awake. Wordsworth’sintense sensitivity to the beauty and the is-ness of the natural world made himthe archetypal Romantic poet and the most influential poet of the nineteenthcentury. He spent most of his life in one of the most beautiful parts ofEngland, the Lake District, and his poems are full of detailed descriptions ofthe sublime, awe-inspiring landscapes of the region. Many of Wordsworth’spassages describe his awareness of the spirit-force pervading the natural world,some of which come very close to descriptions of the all-pervading presence ofbrahman in the Upanishads (which Wordsworth almost certainly never read). Forexample, in one of his most beautiful and profound poems, “Lines Written a FewMiles above Tintern Abbey,” he writes: And I have felt A presence that disturbs me with the joy Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime Of something far more deeply interfused, Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, And the round ocean and the living air, And the blue sky, and in the mind of man: A motion and a spirit; that impels All thinking things, all objects of all thought, And rolls through all things.29 [part0027.html#rch3en29]In another of his most beautiful poems, “Intimations of Immortality,” which Icompared above to Whitman’s “Whispers of Heavenly Death,” Wordsworth describeshow children’s fresh, intense perception enables them to see a world “apparell’din celestial light” with “the glory and freshness of a dream.” However, as webecome adults we move away from the “heaven” of our infancy. “Shades of theprison-house begin to close” and the glorious vision of childhood fades “intothe light of common day.”30 [part0027.html#rch3en30] This is a good example ofhow natural wakefulness fades into sleep as we grow older. However, Wordsworthhimself didn’t seem to undergo this process of falling asleep. Even at ageseventy-five he was still able to write a poem like “So Fair, So Sweet, WithalSo Sensitive,” where the beauty of a mountain-daisy amazes him and enables himto “converse with Nature in pure sympathy.”31 [part0027.html#rch3en31]Although we know very little about his life, the poet and painter William Blake,Wordsworth’s near contemporary, also seems to have been naturally awake. In hispoems Blake writes of being able to see “heaven in a wild flower” and “eternityin an hour,”32 [part0027.html#rch3en32] and was so sensitive to the is-ness ofthings that, as a friend of his reported, he would spend hours staring in wonderat knots in a piece of wood. This was probably also true of Percy Shelley,another nineteenth-century English poet, whose poems display a similarheightened awareness to Wordsworth’s and the same awareness of the spirit-forcepervading the world. In his famous poem “Hymn to Intellectual Beauty,” Shelleydescribes this spirit-force as “the awful shadow of some unseen Power” that“floats though unseen among us.”33 [part0027.html#rch3en33]There are many other possible examples of awakened poets and authors; in fact,it would probably be possible to fill a whole book with them. (Perhaps I willone day!) In American literature alone, figures such as Ralph Waldo Emerson,Henry David Thoreau, Emily Dickinson, E. E. Cummings, Henry Miller, and RobinsonJeffers were clearly familiar with the wakeful state. European literature alsooffers many clear examples of awakened artists, such as the German poet RainerMaria Rilke, the great German novelist Hermann Hesse, and the French Romanticpoet Alphonse de Lamartine.There are also many painters who seem to have experienced wakefulness as anatural state. The Romantic tradition was expressed as strongly through visualart as it was through poetry. European painters such as John Constable, WilliamTurner, Caspar David Friedrich, and the American painters Thomas Cole and GeorgeInness clearly perceived the natural world with a heightened intensity, freefrom the functional automatic perception of the sleep state, and felt stronglyconnected to it. Just as Wordsworth and Whitman had the literary skill to conveytheir spiritual vision and insights through poetry, these artists had thetechnical ability to convey their sense of wonder and transcendence throughtheir paintings. As for poetry, there was a strong association betweenwakefulness and visual art, which continued through the nineteenth century withimpressionists such as Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, Pierre-Auguste Renoir,and Vincent van Gogh, whose paintings shimmer with intense is-ness and beauty.Arguably, most of the great artists until the beginning of the twentieth centuryexpressed an awakened perspective to some degree, until naturalism andimpressionism became unfashionable and abstract and conceptual art took over.Of course, some of these poets and painters may only have known awakening on atemporary rather than a permanent basis. Perhaps some of them simply had regularawakening experiences rather than wakefulness as an ongoing state. (This couldwell be true of figures such as Shelley and van Gogh, for example.)Nevertheless, these examples do show that wakefulness can occur naturally,without the support of spiritual practices or paths. After all, most of thepeople I’ve discussed in this chapter knew little or nothing about Easternspiritual traditions — or even Western mystical traditions — and would certainlynot have thought of themselves as enlightened or awakened. They illustrate thatwakefulness can express itself in many different ways and is primarily apsychological or ontological state that belongs to human nature itself ratherthan to any particular tradition or teaching."},{"pageContent":"4. Natural Wakefulness: Confusion and Integration [part0005.html#rch4]For Walt Whitman and D. H. Lawrence, wakefulness seems to have been fairlyuncomplicated. They simply were naturally awake, and their wakefulness emergedand expressed itself without apparent difficulties. However, in this chapterwe’ll look at examples of natural wakefulness where there were difficulties,mainly due to lack of self-understanding and self-acceptance.When wakefulness occurs in the context of spiritual or religious traditions, aperson has a readily available framework (together with the guidance of otherswho have experienced wakefulness) to help them understand their state. Withoutsuch support, naturally wakeful people may experience some confusion and doubt.They may feel threatened by their spiritual impulses and try to repress them. Itmay take them several years to understand and accept their innate wakefulnessfully.Naturally awakened people who live in cultures that don’t support a spiritualunderstanding of the world are in particular danger of this difficulty. Thevalues of their culture may clash with their awakened impulses. We all absorbcultural influences as we grow up, and it may take several years for naturallywakeful people to work off their cultural conditioning so that they can begin tolive authentically. They may feel a powerful impulse to live a different kind oflife — to turn away from materialism and hedonism, to simplify their lives andspend more time in solitude, for example — but it may be a number of yearsbefore they feel confident and autonomous enough to follow the impulse. Untilthen, they may feel an intense sense of frustration because their innatewakefulness can’t express itself.Peace PilgrimThe American wanderer and social activist who called herself Peace Pilgrim, oneof the most remarkable and unusual awakened people of the twentieth century, wassuch a case. Peace Pilgrim was born Mildred Norman in 1908. After a fairlynormal childhood — distinguished only by her precocious intelligence and unusualinquisitiveness — she began to ponder deep existential questions as a teenager.At the age of sixteen, she began to wonder about the nature of God and concludedthat God wasn’t a being but everything that was “beyond human understanding.”She “touched God” as a force whose qualities were love, kindness, and truth. Asshe describes it: “It came to me that God is a creative force, a motivatingpower, an over-all intelligence, an ever-present, all pervading spirit — whichbinds everything in the universe together and gives life to everything. Thatbrought God close. I could not be where God is not.”1 [part0027.html#rch4en1]Looking back in later life, Peace Pilgrim recognized a number of signs of “beingprepared for her pilgrimage.” In high school there was peer pressure to smokecigarettes and drink alcohol, but she abstained from both. Her friends ridiculedand rejected her, but she justified herself by telling them, when a group ofthem were gathered together, “Life is a series of choices, and nobody can stopyou from making your choices, but I have a right to make my own choices, too.And I have chosen freedom.”2 [part0027.html#rch4en2] Another sign of PeacePilgrim’s future path was her harmonious relationships. Whenever there was anydiscord between her and others, or when anyone showed animosity toward her, shenever felt resentment and always acted quickly to heal the relationship.In other ways, however, Peace Pilgrim lived a fairly normal life until herthirties. She married at the age of twenty-five and initially abided byconventional American values, living a materialistic lifestyle. “I had been ledto believe that money and possessions would insure me a life of happiness andpeace of mind,” she said. “So that was the path I pursued.”3[part0027.html#rch4en3] However, she soon began to realize that thematerialistic lifestyle was meaningless and not the life meant for her. At thesame time, she was confused because she had no idea what kind of life was meantfor her.Her lifestyle frustrated her more and more. In particular, she feltuncomfortable “about having so much while my brothers and sisters werestarving.”4 [part0027.html#rch4en4] She was filled with a deep yearning for amore meaningful path. One evening when she was thirty, she walked all nightthrough the woods in desperation and finally came to a clearing, where sheprayed. As she recalls: “I felt a complete willingness, without anyreservations, to give my life — to dedicate my life — to service. ‘Please useme!’ I prayed to God. And a great peace came over me. . . . And so I went intothe second phase of my life. I began to give what I could, and I entered a newand wonderful world.”5 [part0027.html#rch4en5]In one article I’ve read about Peace Pilgrim, this experience is interpreted asa moment of transformation in which her new spiritual self was born.6[part0027.html#rch4en6] However, the experience wasn’t related to any particularevent or trigger (unlike most cases of sudden awakening) and wasn’t generated byspiritual practice. The wakefulness that emerged had seemingly been presentinside her. This was the point when she accepted her innate wakefulness afteryears of repressing it because it conflicted with the values of her culture. Theconfusion and frustration caused by this repression eventually became so intense— as the inner pressure of her innate wakefulness’s drive to express itself grewstronger — that she had no choice but to surrender.From this point, Peace Pilgrim lived a new, authentic life. She was aware of apowerful spiritual force inside her, which she sensed inside others as well, sothat she felt an intense connection to everyone and a strong impulse to servethe human race as a whole. She lived a life of service, working with elderlypeople and people with mental health problems. She then served as a volunteerwith peace organizations, such as the Women’s International League for Peace andFreedom. (Her peace activism led to divorce from her husband, who fought in theSecond World War.) She also drastically simplified her life: she became avegetarian, lived on a low income, and freed herself from most of herpossessions. She formulated a set of personal spiritual principles to live by,including purification of the body (through diet and exercise), purification ofthought (refraining from negative thoughts), relinquishing attachments tomaterial goods, relinquishing feelings of separateness, and relinquishingnegative feelings or reactions.Peace Pilgrim’s innate wakefulness was nurtured and deepened by this lifestyle.In one of her pamphlets, Steps Toward Inner Peace, she describes anotherpowerful experience that occurred while she was out walking one morning:All of a sudden I felt very uplifted, more uplifted than I had ever been. Iremember I knew timelessness and spacelessness and lightness. . . . Everyflower, every bush, every tree, seemed to wear a halo. There was a lightemanation around everything and flecks of gold fell like slanted rain throughthe air. . . . I knew before that all human beings are one. But now I knew alsoa oneness with the rest of creation. . . . And, most wonderful of all, a onenesswith that which permeates all and binds all together and gives life to all. Aoneness with that which many would call God.I have never really felt separate since.7 [part0027.html#rch4en7]Soon after this experience, on January 1, 1953, Peace Pilgrim began herpilgrimage. After leading the Rose Parade in California (an annual New Yearcelebration), she kept walking. She continued to walk across the country,eventually arriving at the United Nations building in New York the followingDecember. And from this point on, Peace Pilgrim never really stopped walking.With no possessions except a toothbrush, one set of clothes, a comb, and apencil, she crisscrossed the United States seven times on foot, as well aswalked in Canada and Mexico. Wearing a tunic with the words “Peace Pilgrim” onthe front and “25,000 miles on foot for peace” on the back, she found that shecould rely on strangers to approach her, and to give her food and a bed for thenight (although she often slept outdoors). In effect, she lived as a wanderingmonk supported by laypeople. She walked an average of twenty-five miles a day,often stopping for speaking engagements or interviews along the way,particularly as she became more well known.Throughout the rest of her life — another twenty-eight years — Peace Pilgrimexperienced a constant sense of unshakeable inner peace and oneness, a constantsense of communion with the divine. As she writes, “There is a feeling of alwaysbeing surrounded by all the good things, like love and peace and joy. It seemslike a protective surrounding, and there is an unshakeableness within, whichtakes you through any situations you need to face. . . . There is a calmness anda serenity and unhurriedness — no more striking or straining.”8[part0027.html#rch4en8]We saw in chapter 2 [part0009.html#8IL20-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5] thatthe all-pervading spiritual force described by different spiritual traditions —and the spiritual essence of our individual being — is often described in termsof brilliant light, so it’s interesting that Peace Pilgrim spoke of a “divinelight” that she could share. She describes how, when she was with other people,she would feel her own divine nature connecting with theirs, and felt as if shewere “lifting them” and “bringing God’s light to them.” She writes, “I try toenvision them bathed in God’s light and finally I do see them standing andreaching out their arms bathed in golden light. At that point I leave them inGod’s hands.”9 [part0027.html#rch4en9] There are interesting parallels here withthe Kabbalistic idea of tikkun olam, the healing of the world. In a very realsense, Peace Pilgrim was bringing her own enlightenment into the world to shareit with others.In 1981, at the age of seventy-two, Peace Pilgrim died in a car crash whilebeing driven to a meeting. This might seem tragic, but it would not haveappeared that way to Peace Pilgrim. Like Whitman and Lawrence, she saw death asa “glorious transition to freer living” and “life’s last great adventure.”10[part0027.html#rch4en10]Peace Pilgrim is similar to the awakened artists we looked at in the previouschapter in that her life was defined by what her wakefulness enabled her to dorather than her wakefulness itself. Her life was defined by her altruism and hersense of mission, which stemmed from her ability to empathize with other humanbeings and her overarching sense of justice and morality. She is a good exampleof spiritual activism to refute the notion that spiritual development meansbecoming narcissistic, passive, and detached from the world.GavinIn my own research, I haven’t come across many examples of natural wakefulness,which is why I believe that it’s the most uncommon type of wakefulness. But hereI’ll describe one of the cases I did come across.Gavin Whyte is in his early thirties and the author of several works of fictionand nonfiction on spiritual themes. As a child, he was fascinated by theparanormal — he loved to read nonfiction about psychic phenomena rather thancomics and storybooks — and started to write his own ghost stories. He alwayssensed that, in his words, “there was more to life than what we can see with thephysical eyes.” He also loved to spend time alone. His schoolteachers noticedthat he had a quality of stillness and attentiveness. Unlike other children, helooked at them intently when they spoke to him.In his teenage years, Gavin’s parents began to think he was strange because hedidn’t seem to get upset when bad things happened. Once, at about the age offourteen, the family was in a restaurant when a waitress spilled a drink inGavin’s lap. While everyone else was making a fuss, he just calmly took a napkinand started to wipe his trousers, causing his father to exclaim, “My God, didyou see how he reacted?” A similar thing happened when he learned to drive atthe age of seventeen, and his first car was stolen soon afterward. Gavin’sfather was devastated, but Gavin didn’t see any reason to be upset. “I think myreaction made my dad even more angry than the crime itself,” Gavin said. “But Icouldn’t see what all the fuss was about. It had been stolen and that was that.”His father was also worried about the amount of time Gavin spent alone. As Gavintold me:I used to lay on my bed in silence, much to my dad’s confusion. I can rememberturning off my bedroom light, lighting a candle, and just staring at it forages. I used to lie on my bed doing nothing. I used to gaze up at the sky andlet my mind wander. I had a strong impulse just to stare, to look and observe. Iwould take the family dogs out for walks and spend the time looking at thestars, trees, and flowers. I most definitely felt like the black sheep in thefamily.Gavin had always loved Bruce Lee films and started to practice kung fu. This ledhim to dip into Eastern philosophies such as Zen Buddhism and Daoism. As aresult, he had a framework to make sense of his meditative impulses and hisdesire for solitude, and didn’t allow his family’s confusion to affect him.However, at the age of nineteen he went through a spell of frustration anddepression. He was a musician and spent hours and hours recording songs in hisbedroom. He was determined to become a successful pop musician; he continuallysent off samples of his songs but didn’t receive any positive feedback. He was“overly ambitious,” he recognizes now, and his lack of success frustrated him sothat he began to see himself as a failure. He was working at a supermarket andhated every minute of the job, feeling that he should have been a successfulmusician instead. His innate wakefulness was obscured by egoic tendencies. Butone evening he had a powerful transformational experience that freed him fromegoism and dissolved away his frustration so that his natural wakefulness wasable to express itself more fully:I was out walking the dogs, about 12 o’clock in the afternoon. It was abeautiful day. I let the dogs off the lead and let them run around, and I foundmyself staring at a tree. I was glued to it. . . . The tree became the mostbeautiful thing I had ever seen — ever. It shone new colors. But not only that —I became one with the tree to such an extent that I no longer existed. All thatwas left existing was everything! I saw the oneness of life. My identity, alongwith all of its insecurities, ambitions, goals, and fears, melted away like icein the desert. To this, all I could do was laugh.Since this experience Gavin has felt a strong, ongoing sense of innercontentment and gratitude, and a continual sense of awe at the world, which heexpresses through his writing. Sometimes egoic tendencies rise up, but he findsit easy to reconnect to the strong undercurrent of wakefulness that is alwaysinside him. For example, when he feels that his mind has become too busy withthought-chatter, “I turn my attention to my breath or the movement of my body orthe aliveness of the moment and watch thought-chatter quieten into thebackground. Then observation and the input of the other senses seem to absorbmore energy than inner noise.”My Own Natural WakefulnessThis is a good place to refer to my own experience of wakefulness, since I seemyself as another example of natural wakefulness.I want to be careful here. In my own encounters with spiritual teachers andgurus, one of my guiding principles has been, “If someone proclaims themselvesas enlightened, then they probably aren’t.” Genuinely wakeful people tend to behumble. They might agree that they are enlightened if you press them on thematter, but they tend not to broadcast it. Although they may feel a sense ofmission, an impulse to share their wisdom and aid the development of others,they often don’t go out of their way to attract attention or followers. On theother hand, narcissistic or self-deluded spiritual “teachers” are oftenself-aggrandizing, loudly proclaiming themselves as avatars or saviors andtrying to attract as much attention (and as many followers) as possible.As a result, I’m reluctant to “come out” as an awakened person. I’m aself-effacing Englishman and reluctant to make any claims that may be construedas arrogant. So let me preface this discussion of my own wakefulness byreminding you that there are different varieties and degrees of wakefulness, andI certainly don’t claim that my own wakefulness is of the highest or purestdegree. However, it would be foolish not to include my own experience of naturalwakefulness simply for modesty’s sake.When I do presentations or workshops — and especially when I talk about myresearch into the connection between psychological turmoil and spiritualawakening — people often ask me, “Have you been through a spiritualtransformation yourself?” My answer is usually something along the lines of,“No, for me there wasn’t a sudden moment of transformation. There has been aninnate spiritual sensibility inside me for as long as I can remember, which justseemed to be there naturally. My spiritual development was all aboutunderstanding this part of myself, accepting it, and allowing it to expressitself fully.”When I was a teenager, my natural wakefulness caused me some difficultiesbecause I couldn’t make sense of it. It didn’t fit into the culture I was borninto. The two main aspects of my upbringing were soccer and television.Encouraged by my father, who was a devoted Manchester United fan, I spent all mytime either playing or watching soccer or watching television. There was noreligion in my upbringing — my parents didn’t think of themselves as atheistsbut had no interest in religion. (Although you could say that soccer was myfather’s religion!) Culture wasn’t prominent in my upbringing either — no music,very few books, and no intellectual or cultural interests. We rarely — if ever —went to the cinema or theater. I don’t have any complaints — I had a great timeplaying soccer with my dad and my friends in the street or at the park. Myparents were attentive and loving and gave me a secure emotional foundation, forwhich I’m very grateful.The problems came when, around the age of sixteen, I changed from the normalsoccer-obsessed kid I’d always been to a much more introverted, self-conscious,and serious person who no longer felt that I belonged to my environment. I feltthat I became this different person within the space of a few months.I had been taught that the most important things in life were to have a goodtime and to “get on.” My father especially had taught me the importance of beingpopular and sociable, and having an entertaining personality. I’d also beentaught the importance of trying to earn money so that you could have a nice carand buy other nice things. But I had no interest in any of these areas. I wentto pubs and drank beer and tried to be sociable, but I didn’t enjoy it and neverfelt comfortable. I preferred to spend my time alone, reading or listening tomusic, or walking the streets. I was attracted to nature and quietness, butthere was very little nature in my city. In the evenings, when it was dark, I’doften go back to my school, climb over the gates, and wander around the schoolfields simply because it was the only quiet and natural place near to me where Iknew I wasn’t likely to encounter other people. The open space of the fields andthe open space of the sky and the quietness around me filled me with a sense ofcalmness and wholeness. The clouds looked so real and alive that they seemed tobe sentient, and the black spaces between them amazed me with their deeprichness. The sky was very important to me because it was the only untouchedopen natural space I had access to.I felt exhilarated by these states of well-being and wonder, but I also thoughtthere was something wrong with me. I didn’t understand why I couldn’t functionthe way I was supposed to. I was very quiet; I’d sit in groups of people in apub or youth club but find it impossible to say anything. As a result, peoplebegan to think I was “weird.” My parents were worried about me; they saw me as a“loner” who borrowed “strange books” about philosophy and psychology from thelibrary.Luckily I did quite well at school. I passed exams that enabled me to go touniversity so that I didn’t have to face the challenge of choosing a job orcareer immediately after school. I thought I’d meet like-minded people atuniversity, but I was mostly disappointed. There was an even stronger emphasison drinking and socializing than in my home environment, and I had an evenstronger sense of alienation. But at least I was studying literature, whichmeant that I had a lot of free time. In my second year, I saw an advertisementfor a talk on Transcendental Meditation (TM) — I wasn’t sure exactly whatmeditation was, but I felt attracted to it. After the talk, I signed up for TMclasses and was given my own mantra. I experienced the healing and calmingeffects of meditation straight away, although I didn’t have the self-disciplineto practice it regularly.At university I started a daily routine that I’d follow for many yearsafterward. I’d stay up very late, usually until around four or five o’clock inthe morning, and get up around lunchtime (or later) the next day. I loved goingon walks when the streets were deserted and everyone else was asleep; I enjoyedthe stillness and spaciousness. I felt a strong connection with trees and feltthat in some way the trees came to life when the rest of the city was asleep. Icould sense their sentience and felt that they were communicating with eachother as well as with me. In my second year at university I lived on theoutskirts of town, close to the countryside, and spent a lot of time walking orcycling through the fields, lanes, and villages, absorbing the healing influenceof nature.Around this time (as I describe in Waking from Sleep) I went through a processof purgation and renunciation. I stopped going to my lectures at university,isolated myself from other people, and tried to live as simply as possible. Icut myself off from all the things I depended on for identity or security. Iinflicted discomfort — and sometimes pain — on myself, sleeping on a hard floorand taking cold baths. Although I wasn’t aware of it at the time, I was livinglike an ascetic monk. The whole process was instinctive, without any consciousaim, but in retrospect I can see that I was trying to develop self-discipline,to strengthen my willpower. At the same time, I was trying to pare down my lifeto its essence so that I could free myself from the environmental influences I’dabsorbed and uncover my true self.During this time, I still felt confused and alienated. I had no idea who Ireally was or what I was meant to be doing. At times, I felt so desperate that Ithought about committing suicide. After I left university — with a poor degree,due to all the lectures I had missed — I had no desire to follow any particularcareer and no idea what my future might hold. For the next couple of years Idrifted between periods on the dole (claiming unemployment benefits) andlow-paid menial jobs. I had moments of intense well-being — even euphoria — butmy underlying wakefulness was often overlaid with my depression, unease, andconfusion.However, around the age of twenty-two, I finally began to understand my naturalwakefulness. I had already developed some self-understanding after reading ColinWilson’s classic study of alienation, The Outsider, which explained to me why Icouldn’t fit in to ordinary society and suggested that it was actually apositive thing to be different. The book gave me a framework to make some senseof my isolation and alienation, although its emphasis was more existential thanspiritual. But then I stumbled upon Mysticism: A Study and Anthology by F. C.Happold, which contained short excerpts from spiritual texts and the writings ofChristian and Eastern mystics. Most of the passages resonated deeply with me. Irecognized my own experiences in them. Out of all the passages, the excerpt fromthe Upanishads touched me most. Soon afterward, when I read the Upanishads as awhole, I felt a tremendous sense of homecoming and reassurance. I saw my ownvision of the world in them, particularly in the passages that describe thepresence of brahman in all things. I knew that I could see brahman in the world,too, particularly in the sky. After that, I read Walt Whitman’s “Song ofMyself,” D. H. Lawrence’s Selected Poems, and many other spiritual books. Justas importantly, I discovered the spiritual music of Van Morrison and his albumsInarticulate Speech of the Heart and No Guru, No Method, No Teacher. This musicwas borne out of — and depicted — exactly the same spiritual sensibility I wasexperiencing, and was a powerful inspiration to me. It opened up a landscape ofspiritual experience that was deeply familiar, in which I could feel completelyat home.Now everything began to make sense. I was building an intellectual framework tomake sense of my wakefulness. My confusion was dissipating, replaced by a senseof orientation and direction. I felt like I had arrived home and began to trustand accept my wakefulness, which began to stabilize and intensify as a result.It was a wonderful period — I felt ecstatic, uplifted, in touch with my ownessence, and in communion with the world. I could sense beauty and wondereverywhere around me and the presence of spirit-force (or brahman) pervading theworld. Just a couple of years after contemplating suicide, I felt incrediblygrateful to be alive. I still had no idea where I was going in my life but itdidn’t seem to matter. All that mattered was to be alive in the gloriouspresent. I finally understood and accepted myself.It wasn’t all easy sailing from this point, though. After about three years ofecstatic wakefulness, new challenges emerged. Music was one of my passions andat the age of twenty-four I was invited to join a friend’s band — as bassguitarist — and moved abroad. There I began to disconnect from the framework I’dbuilt up. I started to follow a typical musician’s hedonistic lifestyle, smokingand drinking too much; I was surrounded by other people who did the same. I knewthat this lifestyle wasn’t congruent with my real self, and the dissonancecaused frustration. I was also in a difficult relationship with my girlfriendand struggled with the demands of everyday life (such as earning enough money tolive). After struggling for so long to connect with the core of my own being, Ibecame disconnected, and felt frustrated and depressed again.I now see this period of my life as a time of integration. Although I may havebeen well developed spiritually, I was undeveloped in other areas of my life. Ihad poor emotional and social skills, and a lack of self-confidence andself-efficacy. It might not have mattered so much if I was a monk, but themodern world is a complex and demanding place and I knew I needed to learn tofunction in it. My being was imbalanced, which meant my wakefulness wasn’t fullyintegrated and could be easily destabilized.However, as I matured and developed in these areas my being became much moreintegrated and my wakefulness become more stable and deep-rooted. My frustrationand depression faded away permanently. Around the age of thirty, I stoppedsmoking, became a vegetarian, began to meditate regularly, and learned yoga. Iharmonized my lifestyle with my inner self, as Peace Pilgrim did after herpowerful experience in the woods at the age of thirty.11[part0027.html#rch4en11] I was back home again, but this time home felt a littledifferent. Obviously my wakefulness was essentially the same, but it had aslightly different tone. My earlier wakefulness had been more of a high-arousalstate, exhilarating and dynamic, but this time around it was closer to alow-arousal state — calmer, more contained, less volatile. It was akin to theserene type of awakening experience that comes after a deep meditation or timespent in beautiful natural surroundings, not the ecstatic type of awakeningexperience that is sometimes generated by sex or dancing, which I hadexperienced before.I’ve remained in this stable state of wakefulness ever since. Somecharacteristics have intensified, new aspects have unfolded, and new insightsand revelations have emerged. But after a long process of self-understanding andintegration, my natural wakefulness has essentially manifested itself fully.Understanding Natural WakefulnessThe above examples illustrate the importance of possessing an intellectualframework to make sense of one’s wakefulness. Without this, wakefulness caneasily be overridden by confusion and frustration.However, it’s interesting that the examples of natural wakefulness in theprevious chapter — such as Walt Whitman and D. H. Lawrence — don’t appear tohave had these difficulties, at least so far as we can tell. To some extent, itmay depend on the culture a person is born into, and how incongruous oracceptable wakefulness appears in relation to its values and conventions.Wakefulness is particularly incongruous in urban, industrialized, competitive,and consumerist cultures, such as the modern Britain I was born into or theprewar America in which Peace Pilgrim grew up. Both Whitman and Lawrence wereborn into largely preindustrial societies, when modern competitive capitalismwas at an early stage. As a result, perhaps there wasn’t as much culturalresistance to their wakefulness.Wakefulness is encouraged and supported in some cultures that have strongspiritual traditions, such as in India or Thailand. In these cultures, naturallywakeful people presumably have fewer problems understanding and integratingtheir wakefulness. (This issue of whether wakefulness is supported orpathologized will be important later, in chapter 10[part0017.html#G6PI0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5], when we examine thespiritual crisis that sometimes occurs after sudden awakening.)Speaking more generally, however, how should we understand natural wakefulness?Why do a small minority of people appear to be born naturally awake? Or moreprecisely, why do a small number of people seem to naturally have a differentkind of self-system, with a more connected and expansive sense of identity andwithout the automatized perception of our normal state?The best way to think of naturally wakeful people is to see them as rare“evolutionary throw-forwards.” I don’t want to say too much about evolution atthis point because I’m going to discuss the connection between wakefulness andevolution in detail in the last chapter of this book. However, evolution ispartly a process by which living beings become progressively more conscious andalive, whereby they develop a more intricate and expansive awareness. In theseterms, naturally wakeful people can be seen as the early representatives of astate of more expansive awareness that will one day become normal to all humanbeings. They’re early manifestations of the evolutionary leap that our speciesmay be undergoing, and a sign that it’s occurring.In the next chapter we’ll look at what could be interpreted as another sign ofthis evolutionary leap: the impulse to awaken that leads many people toinvestigate spiritual practices and paths, and which also leads to the second ofthree ways in which wakefulness can occur."},{"pageContent":"5. Gradual Awakening in Spiritual Traditions [part0005.html#rch5]The second way wakefulness can occur — after natural wakefulness — is graduallyand incrementally over a long period of development. Sometimes this happensaccidentally, but in most cases gradual awakening is undertaken consciously andoccurs by following spiritual practices and paths.Most people accept their normal vision of the world as reality and their normalstate of psychological discord as inevitable. But for those who realize thatthey are asleep — who instinctively sense that their awareness is limited, thattheir psychological discord can be healed, and that there’s a more authenticidentity beneath the normal superficial self — the impulse to wake up usuallybecomes the main motivating force of their lives. These people aren’tparticularly interested in taking up a profession and becoming successful orwealthy, or in accumulating possessions like cars or furniture. They aren’tparticularly concerned about their appearance or trying to impress other peoplewith their status or charm. Rather than seeking pleasures and comforts, theydevote their lives to something much more important: following their impulse forself-transformation. They become what are sometimes called seekers, but what wewill call “awakeners.”For some people, this impulse to awaken is completely innate and was alwaysinside them. For others, it emerges after temporary awakening experiences. Aperson might have an experience of heightened awareness, oneness, and deepserenity while walking in the countryside, while making love, or after taking apsychedelic substance such as LSD. They become suddenly aware that there ismore, that their normal vision of the world is limited and their normal state ofbeing is just one state of being. They feel that the state of being theyexperience in these moments is somehow truer and more authentic than theirnormal one. After experiencing heightened awareness, they may begin toinvestigate spiritual paths and practices as a way of regaining access to thisdimension in a more stable and ongoing way. Although I’m generally cautiousabout using psychedelic substances as a method of awakening, they can providewhat Ken Wilber calls a “peek experience” (as opposed to a peak experience), aglimpse of an unsuspected transcendental dimension that brings about a change inthe conception of reality and a shift in values. (I’ll discuss the question ofwhether psychedelics can lead to permanent, ongoing wakefulness in chapter 9[part0016.html#F8900-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5].)This impulse to wake up can cause frustration if it doesn’t find an outlet. Aswith people who are naturally wakeful, awakeners might wonder if there’ssomething wrong with them, why they don’t feel satisfied with the pleasures andgoals that most people strive for. They might feel that they are “outsiders” whocan’t fit in to ordinary life. (Colin Wilson’s The Outsider is all about peoplein this phase.) But awakeners can usually find an outlet for their impulse towake up without difficulty, due to widespread public knowledge of spiritualpractices and paths. Awakeners are instinctively drawn to spirituality, even ifthey might not be aware of why they feel attracted to it. They may only be awareof the impulse to quiet their minds, to find inner peace, or to overcomeself-centeredness, although, at a deeper level, these are expressions of theirinstinct to awaken. (Of course, there are other reasons why people followspiritual teachings or practices besides a straightforward impulse forawakening. Some people adopt spirituality as a kind of religion and use it tosatisfy their psychological needs for belonging, identity, and consolation. Forexample, followers of guru-centered spiritual traditions sometimes see the guruin quasi-divine terms, projecting notions of perfection and omnipotence ontothem and using their worship and faith as a way of escaping from their ownpsychological issues.)For some people, gradual wakefulness may come from following a formal spiritualtradition, such as Buddhism, Sufism, or Kabbalah. Or with even more commitment,a person may experience gradual wakefulness by becoming a monk and living themonastic lifestyle of ascetic self-discipline, renunciation, prayer, andmeditation. Or more informally, a person may experience gradual wakefulnesswithout following a specific spiritual path but through living a spirituallifestyle of their own choice. They may practice regular meditation, altruism,and service, and spend a good deal of time in solitude and quiet. Thesepractices and lifestyles may have the effect of gradually transforming theirbeing, moving them slowly from a state of sleep into wakefulness.Paths and Practices of Gradual AwakeningBefore looking into cases of gradual awakening from my own research, we’llreturn our attention to the spiritual traditions we looked at in chapter 2[part0009.html#8IL20-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5]. In that chapter welooked at how they conceive of the state of wakefulness; in this section we’lllook at how they suggest we should go about reaching this state. That is, we’lllook at the different paths, practices, and lifestyle guidelines they recommendto bring about gradual wakefulness.Of course, spiritual practices like meditation can induce temporary awakeningexperiences, which is part of their value. But even more valuable is theirlong-term, cumulative effect. As well as allowing us to step outside the narrow,claustrophobic room of our normal state of being for short periods, they canenable us to gradually dismantle the room so that we can become permanentlyfree.1 [part0027.html#rch5en1]Spiritual paths and spiritual practices represent an amazing discovery: thestate of being that we develop as we become adults isn’t firm and fixed. We havethe freedom and capacity to change our state of being. To borrow Plato’s cavemetaphor, we aren’t doomed to spend our whole lives staring at the shadows onthe wall of the cave; we’re free to gradually turn ourselves around, to face thelight. This isn’t easy — the intense effort and self-discipline required toachieve this transformation are beyond most people. But it can be done. Thepsychological structures that generate our normal experience can be permanentlyaltered. The psychic mold that causes normal psychological structures to quicklyreform after awakening experiences can be dismantled.Millions of people discover their capacity to self-transform in everygeneration, but it was originally made thousands of years ago, after humanbeings underwent the psychological transformation that I call the Fall. Thepeople who first made this discovery formed the spiritual traditions we lookedat in chapter 2 [part0009.html#8IL20-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5]. Throughexperimentation they developed specific practices and techniques to graduallytransform their state of being. They also developed general lifestyle guidelinesto facilitate this change. In some cases, these practices and guidelines grewinto highly detailed systems of self-development, which served as very effectivepaths of wakefulness.As I mentioned in chapter 2[part0009.html#8IL20-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5], ancient India developedthe deepest and most sophisticated understanding of wakefulness. And ancientIndian sages and philosophers designed a wide variety of spiritual practices andpaths to facilitate awakening.The Buddha’s Eightfold Path was one of the first — if not the first — attemptsto clearly and carefully delineate a system of cultivating wakefulness. TheBuddha actually referred to his path as one of “gradual training.” In one of theearliest Buddhist texts, the Udana, he uses the metaphor of an ocean shelf thatgradually slopes down to a sudden precipice: “So also in this Dhamma andDiscipline there is a gradual training, a gradual course, a gradual progression,and there is no sudden penetration to final knowledge.”2 [part0027.html#rch5en2]The Eightfold Path sets out a wide variety of lifestyle guidelines, coveringthree main areas: wisdom, ethical conduct, and concentration. Wisdom includes“right view” or “right understanding,” which means seeing the world as it is,without delusion and ignorance, and understanding the nature and origins ofhuman suffering. (Right view has also been interpreted as a nondogmatic,detached way of seeing without any preexisting concept.) Wisdom also includesright intention or right thought, which means resolving to change, to ridyourself of negative qualities, and to commit to the spiritual path. The ethicalaspect of the path includes right speech, right action, and right livelihood.The concentrative aspects of the path — right mindfulness and rightconcentration — open up the four jhanas, states of deepening absorption in whichyou progressively transcend desires, thoughts, and sensations and reach a finalstate of complete emptiness and pure awareness. In other words, the path leadsto a state of wakefulness in which, in the Buddha’s words, there is “purity ofequanimity and mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. He sits, permeating thebody with a pure, bright awareness, so that there is nothing of his entire bodyunpervaded by pure, bright awareness.”3 [part0027.html#rch5en3]Several centuries after the Buddha, around the second to third century CE, theIndian sage Patanjali developed (or at least first set in writing) a similarpath to awakening. The Yoga Sutras, the text in which Patanjali describes hiseight-limbed path, is typically seen as the most authoritative text on Yogaphilosophy and practice. On the eight-limbed path, you begin by (1) regulatingyour behavior (for example, abstaining from violence and dishonesty, refrainingfrom sensory pleasures and possessions) and (2) developing self-discipline. Youthen proceed through (3) yoga asanas (postures) and (4) breath control, and theninto (5) sensory withdrawal, when you begin to practice mental inwardness,resting your attention in your own mental space. You then learn the (6) practiceof complete mental focus, concentrating on an object or an activity so fullythat your mind becomes quiet and still, then move on to (7) the practice ofmeditation, where you learn to empty your mind and yet at the same time remainhighly alert and conscious. After successfully proceeding through these stages,you attain the final state of (8) samadhi, a permanent higher state ofconsciousness in which you transcend duality and experience the self as part ofthe spiritual essence of the universe.Due to the clear similarities between Patanjali’s eight-limbed path and theBuddha’s Eightfold Path, most scholars believe that Patanjali was influenced bythe Buddhist model. The basic ideas that Patanjali collected and codified wereprobably developed before Buddhism (and in turn had probably influenced theBuddha), but it seems clear that Patanjali adopted the framework of the Buddhistpath in an attempt to create a similar model out of the teachings of Yoga.Despite this, there are some clear differences between the two paths. Forexample, the Buddhist path doesn’t include yoga asanas or breathing exercises(although meditative breathing is a Buddhist practice). Most important, theeight aspects of the Buddhist path don’t have the same linear orientation as thestages of the path of Yoga. The eight interconnected factors are worked onconcurrently. (As such, the Buddhist Eightfold Path is an early version of theintegral philosophy developed by the twentieth-century Indian philosopher SriAurobindo and more recently by Ken Wilber.)Both Hinduism and Buddhism are broad traditions, of course, and other paths ofawakening were developed within them. In Tantric — and some Yogic — schools,awakening is interpreted in terms of raising kundalini, the “coiled energy” atthe lowest of our seven chakras. Once kundalini is aroused, it travels throughan energy channel (the sushumna, which runs roughly parallel with the spine),all the way up to the highest chakra, the sahasrara, at the crown of the head.Here it manifests itself as wakefulness. If you can permanently settle orestablish the energy at the seventh chakra, you will be in a permanent state ofwakefulness in which you attain nirvikalpa samadhi in union with brahman. Theinstinctive energies associated with the lower chakras move upward and aretransformed into a higher spiritual energy called ojas. According to the YogaKundalini Upanishad, at this point, with the rising of kundalini, “The Yogin isexclusively absorbed in the Atman. . . . He takes his stand in his own Self” and“enjoys this highest state. He becomes devoted to the Atman and attains peace.”4[part0027.html#rch5en4]Tantric and Yogic texts recommend methods that can be used to raise kundalini,including asanas, mudras (gestures), breath (prana) control, and forms ofmeditation. The Yoga Kundalini Upanishad states that two things are necessary toraise kundalini: the restraint of prana and a technique calledsaraswati-chalana, which involves sitting in the padmasana posture, manipulatingyour breath, and holding your ribs so that the saraswati nadi can be opened andkundalini can flow through. Another hatha yoga text, the Khecarividya,recommends a mudra called the khecari, in which the tongue is placed above thesoft palate toward the nasal cavity.5 [part0027.html#rch5en5]In the Buddhist tradition, the Sri Lankan scholar Buddhaghosa formulated aseven-stage path to awakening. This progressive process begins with purificationof conduct and mind and ends with purification by knowledge and vision, which isequivalent to enlightenment. Later Buddhist traditions formulated their ownsystems. The Mahayana text the Abhisamayalamkara, for example, suggests afive-stage path toward enlightenment that includes renunciation, meditation, andthe realization of emptiness, leading to a final stage of complete purificationof being. Meanwhile, the Tibetan tradition of Dzogchen developed a detailed pathto awakening that includes a massive range of preliminary practices such ascontemplating death and impermanence, building a relationship with a spiritualteacher, and developing compassion. These preliminaries lead to the mainpractice of meditation, progressing through deeper layers of absorption to therecognition of your pure awareness and emptiness of being.Outside Buddhism and Hinduism, the Chinese Daoists developed their own paths toawakening. They conceived awakening as an overall process of cultivation. Aswith the paths of Yoga and Buddhism, the foundation of this process is ethicalaction, or virtue (de, in Chinese). Other aspects include meditation,psycho-physical exercises (such as qigong), correct diet, and living in harmonywith nature. More specifically, awakening is conceived through a process ofinner alchemy (neiden). Similar to kundalini yoga, lower forms of energy aretransmuted into higher forms through breathing and meditation exercises. Firstof all, sexual energy (jing) is transmuted into vital energy (chi), which isthen transmuted into spiritual energy (shen). Shen then becomes purified, whichis equivalent to a state of ming, or enlightenment, in which you return tonothingness and become one with the Dao.In the Christian world, the most systematic paths of awakening were developed asa part of monastic traditions. Monks in every tradition — including Buddhist andHindu — make awakening the main aim of their lives and sacrifice everything elsefor it. Their whole lives are organized and arranged to facilitate a process ofawakening. This involves renunciation, voluntary poverty, celibacy, long periodsof silence and solitude, and long periods of prayer and meditation.In Jewish spirituality, there’s no monastic tradition, as befits its emphasis onintegrating spirituality into everyday life and its belief that theenlightenment of the individual will help heal the world. Nevertheless, as notedin chapter 2 [part0009.html#8IL20-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5], Kabbalistictexts recommend a variety of techniques and lifestyle guidelines to promotegradual spiritual development and move toward union with God.All of these paths have slight differences, but their aim is essentially thesame: to transcend our normal constricted and separate state of being anddevelop a more expansive and intensified state. We can think of them as slightlydifferent routes — some more detailed than others — that lead to the samedestination, wakefulness.Common ThemesSo what do these different paths tell us about the way to wakefulness? What arethe common principles that we can follow if we want to transform our state ofbeing? I will mention five here, which I believe are the most significant.Ethical BehaviorThe first principle that all traditions agree on — particularly in the initialstages — is regulating one’s ethical behavior. The first stage of Yoga, yama,can be translated as “restraint” and includes five moral obligations:non-harming, truthfulness, nonstealing, chastity, and greedlessness. Similarly,three aspects of Buddhism’s Eightfold Path refer to ethical conduct: rightspeech, right action, and right livelihood.Why should ethical behavior be so important in spiritual development? This isprobably a combination of three factors: mental purity, self-discipline, andenergy. We create disturbance inside us when we behave unethically. Ripples ofunease and anxiety flow both inside and outside us. (From the Buddhist and Hinduperspectives, this also creates bad karma.) When we behave ethically we becomepure and still inside, and prepare ourselves for the deeper stillness ofspiritual development. Unethical types of behavior such as greed, exploitation,and untruthfulness are also fundamentally self-centered; they are based onfurthering our own interests over other people’s. So regulating our behaviormeans moving beyond self-centeredness, which again becomes more important as wemove further along the spiritual path.In a similar way, behaving ethically requires self-control and self-discipline,which are also essential for further development. Some traditions (such as Yoga)believe that regulating our behavior is important as a way of conserving ourenergy. Rather than expending energy through desires and emotions (such as greedor hatred), our energy concentrates inside us, and this surplus energy is usedto fuel spiritual transformation.Purgation or PurificationA second principle in gradual awakening agreed on by all traditions is purgationor purification. This follows naturally from the self-discipline we develop bycontrolling our moral behavior. Purgation is a process of inner strengthening orspiritual training by which we gain some control over our impulses and desires,particularly our instinctive attraction to comfort and pleasure. Through thisprocess we develop stronger willpower, become more self-sufficient, and lessdependent on external conditions for our well-being. Our intention and impulseto wake up begins to override other impulses. Again, this process can be seen interms of energy: as we restrain our desires for comfort and pleasure, we buildup our inner energy.In some traditions, the process of purgation or purification expresses itself inascetic practices, such as the tapas of Yoga, which can mean celibacy, fasting,prolonged standing, or exposure to heat or cold. In Christianity (and to alesser extent in Islamic mysticism), these ascetic practices were often moreextreme, even to the point of sadism. The fourteenth-century mystic Henry deSuso spent years wearing a hair shirt and an iron chain, and wore a cross on hisback containing thirty inward-facing needles and nails. Other traditions such asBuddhism or Kabbalah put less emphasis on this process of self-denial andself-control. The Buddha lived as an ascetic prior to his awakening and wasaware of the dangers of the lifestyle. He therefore advocated the “middle way”between pain and pleasure. Tantric traditions take an even more divergentapproach. They see the body as the manifestation of the divine and make aconscious effort to integrate it into their paths of awakening.These two principles of behavioral regulation and purification can be viewed aspreparatory stages of the spiritual path before real awakening begins. Togetherthey form a process of developing self-discipline and inner stillness andstability (and also an intensification of inner energy) so that we’re ready toenter into ourselves and begin the real work of remolding our state of being.(In Patanjali’s model, this is equivalent to the stage of sensory withdrawal orpratyahara, which comes before meditation.)Letting Go of Psychological Attachments — RenunciationA third principle agreed on by all traditions (or if you like, the first methodof real inner transformation they agree on) is becoming free of psychologicalattachments. Dissolving psychological attachments often occurs in aninvoluntarily way and, as such, can be a powerful trigger both of gradual andsudden awakening. But in traditional spiritual paths, this is undertaken througha conscious process of renunciation.Renunciation means being free of the encumbrances and worldly concerns thatdominate most people’s lives. It means practicing voluntary poverty and livingwithout possessions, and being free of worldly ambitions for success, wealth, orpower, and social roles that confer status and identity. In some traditions, italso means being celibate so that one can be free of the responsibilities offamily life. (As we’ve seen, Jewish spiritual traditions take a very differentview to this, as do Tantric traditions. In Tantra, sex is seen as a form ofspiritual practice.) Renunciation is, of course, the core of the monastic way oflife. Monks separate themselves from ordinary human society primarily as a wayof ensuring that they remain free of psychological attachments.Renunciation is important to the traditions partly because they believe thatawakening has to be the primary thing in our lives. We have to give our wholeselves to it and so can’t afford to be distracted by business, ambitions, orpossessions. Once again, we can see this in terms of energy. The less attachedwe are to external things, the more we build up our inner spiritual energy. Andfinally, one of the biggest dangers of psychological attachments — as we shallsee — is that they strengthen our identity, build up our ego, and make us moreseparate and disconnected from the world and our own deeper selves.(Interestingly, both Peace Pilgrim and I went through a process of purificationand renunciation, not as part of the process of awakening but as a way ofstabilizing and integrating our natural wakefulness. This suggests thatpurification and renunciation are often a necessary part of wakefulness inwhatever form it manifests itself.)ServiceThe fourth common principle of different spiritual traditions’ approach toawakening is service. Altruism and compassion are characteristics of the wakefulstate, but they can also help generate wakefulness. In Buddhism, metta —translated as “benevolence,” “good will,” or “loving-kindness” — is the first ofone of four sublime states that can be cultivated as a means of attainingenlightenment. The second and third of the sublime states are also related tokindness and service — compassion and empathic joy. (The fourth sublime state isequanimity.) In the Buddhist practice of metta bhavana, meditation is used as away of cultivating metta, spreading loving-kindness out in wider and widercircles to embrace more and more people and eventually all sentient beings. Asthe Metta Sutta states, “Even as a mother protects with her life her child, heronly child, so with a boundless heart should one cherish all living beings;radiating kindness over the entire world.”6 [part0027.html#rch5en6] Service is asimilarly important part of the Jewish and Sufi paths to awakening. In Sufism,for example, consciously practicing service is an essential part of the processof becoming one with God. Practicing self-sacrifice and altruism opens us up toGod because the nature of God is love. Our own nature becomes attuned to God’s,and we become one with it.MeditationThe fifth and final theme of traditional paths of awakening is the practice ofmeditation. Meditation is the sine qua non of spiritual practices, the essentialaspect of every path of awakening from Buddhism and Yoga to Daoism, Sufism, andKabbalah. Even in Christianity, meditation practice has a long history,particularly in the monastic traditions and the Eastern Orthodox church. As Ipoint out in Waking from Sleep, meditation can be an effective means ofgenerating temporary awakening experiences. However, its main purpose — and itsmain effect — is long term: to bring about a gradual shift in our psyche; tochange our psychological structure and our psychological functioning in such away that we gradually move away from our normal state of sleep to a state ofwakefulness.In spiritual traditions, meditation is seen as essential for a number ofreasons. First of all, it stills the mind, quietening our distractingthought-chatter and giving us a sense of inner peace. This enables us to goinward, too. The surface thought-chatter of our minds acts as a kind of barrier,which prevents us from investigating the deeper levels of our being. But whenmeditation stills the mind, we’re free to go into ourselves, into deeper andpurer levels of consciousness. In addition, meditation brings increasedself-control. Once we learn to quiet our thoughts we have an increased capacityfor concentration and an increased ability to control our desires and regulateour behavior.Some meditative practices emphasize the importance of observing one’s thoughtprocesses rather than quieting them. This is the basis of Buddhist vipassanameditation, where the aim is simply to stand back from your thoughts, watchingthem arise and fade away without being carried away by them. In practice,though, this type of meditation usually also leads to quieting the mind becauseour thoughts are naturally quieter and slower when we don’t latch onto them.Vipassana meditation emphasizes another important aspect of meditation ingeneral: the process of disidentifying with our thoughts. All forms ofmeditation help bring about a kind of identity shift, where we come to realizethat our true identity isn’t the ego self that does our thinking for us but thedeeper, more authentic part of us that observes the thinking ego self. Whilethis identity shift is taking place, we also experience an increased sense ofconnectedness with the world around us, other human beings, and other beings ingeneral. The more we meditate, the weaker the ego aspect of the self-systemseems to become.The energetic aspect to meditation is important because it explains whymeditation generates heightened awareness. The normal chattering of our ego usesup a great deal of mental energy. Likewise, it takes a lot of energy to maintainthe ego as a structure, with its strong boundaries and sense of identity. Sowhen thinking becomes quieter and the ego becomes weaker as a structure, a largeamount of energy is suddenly freed. This energy naturally redirects itself intoperception. There’s a redistribution of psychic energy — in fact, the exactreversal of the redistribution that occurred with the Fall, when perception wasswitched off to the phenomenal world so that energy could be conserved for thefunctioning of the ego. Perception becomes intensified and enriched, leading toheightened awareness and a renewed awareness of the is-ness and sentience of theworld. In the words of the psychiatrist Arthur Deikman, who conducted one of thefirst studies into the effects of meditation in 1963, meditation brings about a“deautomatization of perception” that leads to an increased sense of thevividness and beauty of everyday objects.7 [part0027.html#rch5en7] Wetemporarily switch into a different kind of self-system in which the ego aspect(or sense of “I”) is much less powerful and dominant.But this doesn’t have to be temporary, of course. If we meditate regularly, wecan generate a permanent and ongoing deautomatization of perception.Beyond TraditionsIn view of these powerful positive effects, it’s not surprising that meditationhas come to be used outside spiritual traditions. Forms of secular meditationhave become popular in the West, from the Transcendental Meditation popularizedby Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and the Beatles in the 1960s to the modern phenomenonof mindfulness meditation developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn and others. Of course,many people don’t (at least consciously) practice meditation because they wantto move toward wakefulness. They may meditate to relieve stress and anxiety,experience calmness and mental clarity, increase their energy levels, or dealwith physical pain. Nevertheless, it’s likely that regularly practicingmeditation will generate some degree of awakening in a person, even if theydon’t realize it.The awakening effects of meditation are no doubt less powerful without thesupport of other spiritual practices (such as service and letting go ofpsychological attachments), but recent research shows that secular, independentmeditation of this kind can bring about significant changes to our state ofbeing. Research into mindfulness, for example, shows that it can bring aboutexactly the permanent deautomatization of perception I’ve just mentioned — astate of ongoing, spontaneous mindfulness, when a person becomes naturallymindful without making a conscious effort to be. Studies find that the long-termeffects of regular mindfulness practice include heightened awareness andincreased attentiveness (as well as increased control of attention), togetherwith less automatic cognitive processes and more spontaneous andpresent-centered behavior.8 [part0027.html#rch5en8]In fact, all of the principles of awakening we’ve looked at can be applied —individually and collectively — outside spiritual traditions. Just as the stateof wakefulness doesn’t have to be interpreted in the context of spiritualtraditions, the process of awakening can take place outside spiritual traditions(while following the same basic principles highlighted by the traditions). Andit’s these cases of gradual secular awakening that we’re going to examine in thenext chapter."},{"pageContent":"6. Gradual Awakening outside Spiritual Traditions [part0005.html#rch6]If someone feels the impulse to awaken, it’s easy to understand why they mightfeel drawn to established spiritual traditions like Buddhism or Kabbalah.Spiritual traditions provide a clear framework, a tried and tested path ofdevelopment. They offer guidance and encouragement from others who have followed— and are following — the same path. In the Hindu tradition, for example, theguru has an important role as a guide through the process of awakening.Following a spiritual tradition can be like traveling along a well-worn route toa destination, with a seasoned traveler to show you the way. The framework mayhelp to ensure that the seeker doesn’t go astray, doesn’t misread signals, anddoesn’t fall prey to self-delusion or self-inflation.However, paths to wakefulness can be difficult to disentangle from the religioustraditions that they are allied to. If you feel an impulse to wake up, you couldfollow the Christian monastic path of awakening, but that may involve acceptingcertain beliefs and concepts that make you uncomfortable. You might find theSufi path of awakening attractive but not feel comfortable with the Islamicbackground of the tradition. In the same way, Hinduism’s cultural background maymake Yogic paths of awakening seem alien to you. Buddhism has less religious orcultural baggage than any other tradition, which is presumably why it’s the mostpopular path of awakening for secular Westerners in the modern world. It isprimarily psychological and existential rather than metaphysical ormythological. Its highly structured and detailed approach — perhaps the moststructured of any tradition — also makes it appealing.Overall, though — probably because of the declining influence of conventionalreligion — more and more people are following paths of gradual awakening outsidespiritual traditions. This approach can be problematic, like traveling to adestination without a clear plan or direction. It can involve a kind of “pickand mix” supermarket approach to spirituality often criticized bytraditionalists. Less direct support and guidance from teachers and fewer groundrules to follow may lead to disorientation. Without a grounding in tradition,there may be a greater danger of delusion and ego-inflation.On the other hand, trying out different practices or elements of different pathsand finding the ones that are best suited to us can allow for a more intuitiveand empirical approach to awakening. We don’t have to give our allegiance to anyparticular philosophy or accept any particular beliefs. We can simply focus onthe transformational practices themselves, without any conceptual baggage.Most of the examples of gradual wakefulness I’ve investigated have been of thiskind — two of which I briefly summarize below.Daniel’s Gradual AwakeningDaniel was born into a middle-class family in Switzerland and, like many peoplein Western societies, was brought up to believe that happiness comes fromachievement and success. After studying at the most prestigious business schoolin Switzerland, he took a high-paying banking job. On top of his long workhours, he studied for qualifications in finance and also began to go climbing,mainly because he loved the sense of achievement when he reached the top of amountain. But despite his success, Daniel had a sense that something wasmissing. As he said, “My life got all too planned, rational, goal-driven.Mostly, I would have this subtle feeling of being stuck in a tight corset. . . .I had trapped myself in fixed and narrow views about myself and the world Iinhabited that shut me out of truly experiencing it.”His thirst for achievement led Daniel to attempt to climb Mount Aconcagua inArgentina, the highest mountain in the Americas. This led to an importantrealization, which he described as follows:On the last day of the ascent my girlfriend couldn’t join us as she had beendiagnosed with symptoms of pulmonary edema. In the days before the final push tothe summit it increasingly became clear that nobody of our group was physicallyup to the challenge and the incident with my girlfriend was just another proofof that. I had grown somehow uneasy and tight during these days but, again, justwouldn’t allow myself to acknowledge my deficiencies. Leaving my girlfriend backin the tent while I struggled to reach the top, the utter uselessness andstupidity of climbing the mountain became clear to me. I didn’t really likeclimbing in high altitude. There was no joy in it. It was just a pure ego thingfor me. I felt incredibly guilty for having dragged my girlfriend to the end ofthe world for nothing but to satisfy my egoism. As I was thinking that way andmy motivation and energy faded, something happened. I remember looking at thestarry night sky and feeling that I had completely lost my way. . . . Then I didsomething I hadn’t done for a long time: I just gave up. And when I allowedmyself to give in, I let go and turned around a few hundred meters short of thetop. I turned my back on my old ways and it felt good somehow. I left some of myold self on that mountain that night.After this trip, Daniel became increasingly frustrated by his materialistic wayof life and more and more conscious that it would not lead to well-being. Thefinancial crisis at that time meant that he had a lot of free time, and hisgirlfriend introduced him to Buddhism. He began to meditate and knew straightaway that it was right for him. He quickly began to sense an inner well-beingthat he knew was more stable and authentic than the short-lived thrill ofachievement. As he said, “It was one of these things you get a taste of andinstantly know that that’s what you have to hold on to, whatever the cost.”Not long afterward, he took LSD and experienced a profound sense of connectionwith nature and other human beings. As he continued his meditation practice, hebegan to realize more and more that he didn’t need to “do” anything or “besomebody” in order to be happy.Six months later, he gave up his apartment, sold most of his possessions,resigned from his job, and traveled overland to India with his girlfriend, withplans to explore spirituality more deeply. Unfortunately, his relationship withhis girlfriend unraveled, and they split up before reaching India. But hecontinued on and, once there, effectively underwent a process of renunciation inwhich he relinquished his psychological attachments. As he told me, “My previouslife completely unwound: no more lover, no more high-paying job, no more niceapartment with lakeside view. I felt painfully stripped and bare. But I knew Iwas doing the right thing.”In India, he meditated regularly and had some powerful spiritual experiences.But his most important experience occurred when he became ill with the fluduring a vipassana meditation retreat. At first he felt full of self-pity butthen experienced a moment of acceptance of his predicament, which initiated aprocess of surrender that touched every area of his life:In the following weeks I was able to let go of a lot of grief, guilt, and shamefrom painful experiences in my life. I shed a lot of tears but it wastremendously healing. My vision of things became gradually much clearer, morelucid. There was a newfound joy in just looking at and experiencing things. Aweand wonder returned to my life. . . . About ten days before I left the retreat,while meditating on a koan (rationally unsolvable Buddhist riddle) I had asudden big opening into realizing that the only thing there was and forever willbe was this One “thing” we are all manifestations of. The accompanying “high” ofrealizing that all was okay lasted almost three days. There were waves of energyand I was giggling a lot. At other times there was a deep silence, where I couldbe sitting for an hour or more completely unwavering in the same spot, beingfilled with bliss.After a few more weeks in India, Daniel felt that he should return to Europe totry to integrate and stabilize his wakefulness. He felt that he needed to facethe conditioning and the thought patterns associated with his previous life andtry to transcend them. The challenge led to a deepening of his awareness. Hebegan to experience a transcendence of duality, of the sense that he was aseparate and distinct “I” experiencing the world. Now he began to identifyhimself with an “eternal witness” beyond experience. He described thisexperience and this present state in these terms:It [the witness] is the silent always-omnipresent container in which and throughwhich things manifest. So, the body and the “me” is an illusion and “real” atthe same time. As this realization is becoming more integrated in my everydayperception of reality I am noticing a shift from a main concern about “me” to aconcern about “us,” which is what I think spirituality is all about. If there isa meaning to life then it is to live, and to live means to love. To love, forme, means to care about “us” more than about “me.” Hence, a self-centered lifepainfully lacks meaning and thus fulfillment.It is now — at the time of writing — six years since Daniel gave up hishigh-paying banking job and his promising financial career. He now works as ateacher and lives in a small village in the Swiss mountains. He has a sense ofliving authentically rather than through the values of his culture, and a strongsense of spaciousness. At the same time, he feels that he is in a state of flux,that his development is still continuing and may never come to an end. As hetold me, “The only constant may indeed be change. I intend to try to flow asgracefully and genuinely as possible with it.”Ed’s Gradual AwakeningEd is an elderly American who has experienced wakefulness as his stable, ongoingstate for around twenty years. His gradual awakening began in his forties, at atime when he was trying to fulfill his ambition to become a successful author.He had received many rejections from agents and publishers but eventuallymanaged to publish two novels and a memoir. However, all three books werefailures, critically and commercially, and eventually he felt he had no choicebut to accept that he wasn’t going to make it as a writer. He was also studyingpart-time for a PhD in English and taught low-level courses at his universitybut never managed to establish a successful academic career either. This alsocontributed to his sense of failure. He later recognized that this period offailure was helpful to his spiritual development. As he told me, “It was as ifthe cosmos was saying, very gently, ‘Relinquish attachment to outcomes, orelse.’ I was invited to become detached by outcomes.”After this, he started to go through a “very gradual and gentle” process ofawakening. He started reading and contemplating, and meditating. His meditationwas irregular at first, but then he found a form of Tantric meditation thatappealed to him. He practiced this intensively for four years and went through agradual process of healing. His frustration and anger faded away, and he beganto feel a general sense of compassion and forgiveness toward himself and anyonewho had hurt him earlier in his life. Then he began to disidentify with his egoand open up to a deeper, more spacious part of himself, which seemed toexperience a natural state of contentment and an easy and natural connection tothe rest of reality.Now Ed lives what he calls “a very surrendered life.” He said, “I have nofurther ambitions. At this point there is nowhere to go.” He senses that he hasno ego-identity, that the name Ed is a convenient fiction, and that the essenceof his being is formless and nameless, a universal consciousness that isexpressing itself through him. He has no fear of death, since “I don’t identifyconsciousness with form.” He lives in a part of the United States where peopleare highly patriotic and define themselves in terms of their religious andpolitical affiliations, but he simply feels himself to be “a citizen of thecosmos.”He also experiences much less thought-chatter than before his awakening. Whenthoughts do arise, he doesn’t identify with them. He sees them as “cloudsdrifting by” that he doesn’t have to latch onto. He enjoys doing nothing inparticular and spends most of his time looking after his wife (who hasParkinson’s disease), fishing, walking his dogs, or just contemplating nature.Spiritual Literature as a Spiritual PracticeReading isn’t usually thought of as a spiritual practice. Indeed, some spiritualteachers are dubious about the importance of books — as the Zen saying goes,“The finger that points at the moon is not the moon.” In other words, you can’tdescribe the indescribable; you can’t confine or reduce spiritual experience towords, either spoken or written. In addition, if we rely on books too much,there’s a danger of becoming too entangled in concepts and ideas, of becomingimmersed in the map and losing sight of reality. There’s also a danger ofintellectual pride, of believing that you’re special because you have access tocomplex, esoteric knowledge to which other people aren’t privy.All of this is true, but I believe that books can still be helpful, in two ways.First, they can be helpful on a basic informational level, to provide guidanceand orientation. Spiritual awakening can be confusing. As we saw in chapter 4[part0011.html#AFM60-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5], people who are naturallyawake may not be able to understand or accept their wakefulness. And whenawakening happens suddenly and dramatically, people may also struggle to makesense of their new state. Books can provide awakened individuals withconfirmation and self-understanding, and help them build an intellectualframework to make sense of their state. I know this from personal experience —books such as F. C. Happold’s Mysticism and the Upanishads were essential forme, as mirrors in which I could see myself. They gave me a clear sense of who Iam and so helped to alleviate my confusion and frustration.Second, some books seem to belie the “finger at the moon” adage. Some books canactually be the moon, in the sense that they can actually communicatewakefulness. A reader may experience temporary wakefulness as they read certainpassages or poems, or even move gradually toward permanent wakefulness throughongoing engagement with certain books or authors.Some poets, such as Walt Whitman or the thirteenth-century Sufi mystic Rumi,certainly have this effect. In fact, poetry is an effective way of communicatingwakefulness because it encourages stillness in the reader. You can’t read poemslike emails or newspaper reports — you have to slow down, be attentive andreceptive. In this way reading poetry can be a form of meditation. (It’sinteresting to note that this kind of contemplative reading is recognized as aspiritual practice in Christian spirituality, where it’s called lectio divina,or “divine reading.”)I’ve come across several cases of gradual awakening where reading was animportant factor. Most of these were linked to the books of Eckhart Tolle, whosewritings have an uncanny power to transmit awakening to the reader. One persondescribed to me how she has been “gradually experiencing inner awakening overthe last five years thanks to Eckhart Tolle.” Another person, Barbara, describeda gradual process of awakening that occurred as a result of psychologicalturmoil combined with reading spiritual literature — mainly the work of EckhartTolle. She described how devastated she was by the “totally unexpected loss ofmy thirty-two-year good marriage,” until a stranger in a bookshop recommendedTolle’s Practicing the Power of Now. She described the book’s impact this way:“That night I read the book right through and had a most astonishing realizationin every chapter of what my loss was about. . . . The book gave me a directionfor going forward. I slept for the first time in weeks.” After this she readTolle’s other books, a book by Byron Katie, then some of my own books. She beganto accept the loss of her marriage and find a new appreciation and wonder in thepresent moment. Her outlook and attitude toward life changed completely. As shedescribed her present state, “Five years after the apparent ‘catastrophe’ [theend of her marriage], I am accepting, content and curious and passionate. . . .I feel a tremendous sense of appreciation and awe. I feel incredibly fortunate.”Involuntary Gradual AwakeningAlthough the gradual awakenings of Daniel, Ed, and Barbara were largelypropelled by spiritual practice, the dissolution of psychological attachmentswas an important aspect of them, too. For Daniel, this was largely a consciousprocess — letting go of his career, ambitions, possessions, apartment,relationship to his girlfriend, and so on. However, Ed was forced to let go ofhis attachments by professional failure. He had no choice but to give up hisambition to be a writer, and this initiated a process of further letting go ordetachment. In a similar way, the end of Barbara’s marriage (and the dissolutionof her attachment to the relationship) was the trigger for her awakeningprocess. (As I mentioned in the last chapter, the dissolution of psychologicalattachments is related to the practice of renunciation in many spiritualtraditions. Renunciation can be seen as a kind of conscious dissolution ofpsychological attachments.)Ed’s and Barbara’s stories highlight the fact that gradual awakening cansometimes be an involuntary process. This was only partly the case for them, butother cases I’ve collected show gradual awakening as primarily an involuntaryprocess — that is, a process that occurred without any conscious volition andwithout any spiritual practices or paths.This involuntary awakening can occur when, without realizing, people followlifestyles or undergo experiences that happen to include the sametransformational elements as spiritual practices and paths. For example, theirlifestyles may have strong meditative aspects to them and/or strong aspects ofservice. My friend, the spiritual teacher Russel Williams, underwent athree-year period of unintentional spiritual training while working for acircus. He groomed, fed, and watered the horses, and learned to use theirdifferent harnesses. He came to feel a powerful sense of connection with them.He also spent a great deal of time observing the horses in order to understandthem. Here he describes how this life of mindful awareness and service affectedhim:I grew to love the animals. . . . It was impossible not to, living with themtwenty-four hours a day. I was determined that I was going to understand themwholly, for what they were, and realized that the only way to do that wasthrough observing them. . . . So I set my mind to watching and observing everydetail, every moment of the day, for days on end.After about three months, I noticed that I wasn’t thinking anymore. My mind hadgone quiet. I realized that knowing and thinking are two different things, andthat you could know without thinking. I wasn’t forming opinions or jumping toconclusions anymore. I began to do things spontaneously, to live in the moment.I had a strong feeling that I was finally going in the right direction, thatthis was my path, and I should keep going with this, carry on observing theanimals so intently.It wasn’t till much later that I realized that the exercise I’d given myself wasmindfulness meditation. In effect, I was meditating about twenty hours a day,seven days a week for three years, completely absorbed in caring for the horses.It was a life of continual service, with no thought for myself.1[part0027.html#rch6en1]In theory, any job or hobby that involves a high degree of mindful awareness andservice could function as a kind of spontaneous spiritual practice that leads togradual awakening. Another person I interviewed described how, while working asa flight attendant in her mid-twenties, she underwent spiritual development evenbefore she knew what the term spiritual meant. As she described from her laterperspective: “My real spiritual development started then. We all worked for acommon purpose. There was a real atmosphere of camaraderie. It was heaven. WhenI stepped onto the airplane and we waited for the passengers you had to be sointensely present. There was no time for little me, for ego to come in. It wasthe best spiritual practice. Just pure presence the whole time. It suited mevery well, a wonderful devotional practice.”Psychological Attachments and Involuntary Gradual AwakeningIn most cases though, the primary factor in most involuntary gradual awakeningis the dissolution of psychological attachments (or involuntary renunciation).I provided examples of this in my earlier book Out of the Darkness.Psychological attachments are the concepts that we depend on for our well-beingand sense of identity. Typically, they include hopes, beliefs, achievements,possessions, and status. These might be gradually broken down as a result of along period of illness (such as cancer), professional failure, negative eventssuch as divorce or unemployment, or alcoholism. These attachments are thebuilding blocks of a person’s identity, so as the attachments dissolve, theperson’s identity also begins to dissolve, and a new identity gradually emergesto replace it.In Out of the Darkness, I introduced Cheryl, who suffered from chronic fatiguesyndrome, as an example of spiritual growth through involuntary renunciation.Originally Cheryl was a high-achieving career woman who lived a busy, stressfullife. But this life began to unravel due to her health problems. She had toleave work and eventually became so ill that she rarely went out; she oftenspent the whole day in bed. Aside from her terrible physical problems, Cherylfound that the illness led to a loss of status and identity that was painfulpsychologically. However, this process of loss was also a process of spiritualgrowth. She found a new ability to live in the present, a new appreciation oflife and the beauty of her surroundings, and a new sense of connection. As shetold me, “Now everything seems real . . . . It seems to have developed over thepast year or so, a heightened awareness and a great joy in everything. Iappreciate things I used to take for granted.”2 [part0027.html#rch6en2] Sherecognized that her ego was being broken down and had the sense that somethingelse — a deeper kind of identity — was emerging in its place. As she put it,“What’s left when these things are gone is what’s behind the ego. It’s anawareness that we’re not individuated — that you and I are the sameconsciousness. I feel like I’m part of something greater than myself.”3[part0027.html#rch6en3]I found a similar example in my PhD research. Kelly, a Canadian woman, sufferedmajor trauma and stress as a result of her ten years in the Canadian military.She later recognized that her experience led to a “humbling or deconstructing ofthe ego” that was “the biggest single factor in my spiritual transformation.”Toward the end of the ten years, she began to feel depressed and burned out. Asshe described it, “I thought I was crazy. I was in the bathroom at work fivetimes a day, hiding so I could cry. I had no control over my emotions. I feltout of control. . . . I would start yelling and swearing (which I never do)about minor things and then have no reaction whatsoever to major things.Everything was backward. I didn’t know what was happening.”After leaving the military, Kelly was diagnosed with posttraumatic stressdisorder (PTSD) and major depression. She felt that she had completely lost hersense of identity:It was a complete loss of me as an intelligent person, me as a functioningperson, me as a person except as a blob on the couch. I was suddenly none of thethings I had always been: effective, efficient, controlled, perfectionistic,high-performing, extremely competent. It was awful. I felt so low. But it wasalso freeing. It was frightening but there was full surrender to whatever wasgoing to happen — my body forced it. I didn’t have a choice. There was just me,on the couch, doing nothing, because I literally couldn’t do anything. I wasforced to see my failure. And I had no idea who I was anymore.After about a year of medical and psychological treatment Kelly becamerelatively functional again and sought alternative treatments to help herfurther. After a couple of years of deliberate healing and growth throughvarious therapies and treatments, she began to experience glimpses ofwakefulness. Once, she was out walking:[And I] just stopped on the sidewalk and relaxed and took in the sun. I openedmy eyes and the world looked different. It was alive. It was infinite aliveness.Everything was bright. Even the space between everything. The colours wereincredible and the flowers looked happy. I looked down and I realized I was thesidewalk. . . . I was amazed at what was there the whole time. It was thebiggest, best joke. It took me 20 minutes to turn the street corner where I waswalking because I was laughing so hard; I just kept stopping and seeingeverything. And it didn’t matter that people were staring at me because I waslaughing wildly. . . . And then the next day everything went back to normal.After other awakening experiences, Kelly began to experience a state ofcontinual bliss and presence. At first this caused some difficulties — she wasso present that words seemed superfluous, and she found it difficult to speak.It took time for her to relearn how to express herself using conventional waysof speaking. But since then there has been a process of integration in whichKelly’s wakefulness has stabilized and deepened, and her intellectual functionshave returned. She summarized her present state as follows:Now everything is a choice — how deep do I go into the vastness? If I want tohave a disembodied peak experience of nothingness I just have to sit still andclose my eyes. Or if I need to work on something then I simply have to choose tonarrow my focus to the task. Sometimes the mind is loud and sometimes quiet butit’s almost always running, unless I do the choosing of the deep nothing statewhere there is no form. . . .The deep aliveness of space is so amazing it takes your words away. When you’represent all the time every day seems full. A day seems to last for such a longtime. . . .I used to shop and be addicted to home and garden television. I wanted to be aninterior designer. I was obsessed with objects and creating peace in space. Iwas looking to possessions as a way to feel better but now I don’t need to feelbetter. There is no attachment. I gave away all my books; I don’t need things. Ican have them, but I don’t need them.I used to be on guard, ready to defend myself against potential criticism orjudgment, always self-conscious, wanting to be seen in the best possible way. .. . I was always aware of myself, how I was being perceived. All of thatstopped. I could just see people instead of focusing on what they thought of me.I was just listening, with so much less judgment, just allowing them to bethemselves. That meant that some people fell away; they needed more engagementfrom me. I wasn’t going in on their stories.As an interesting — and poignant — postscript to Kelly’s story, her ownexperiences led to an interest in spiritual teachings and traditions. She earnedher PhD in transpersonal psychology and is now a university lecturer andresearcher in psychology. We’ve now begun to do research together — in fact, weco-created the “Inventory of Spiritual/Secular Wakefulness” that appears as anappendix to this book.Understanding Gradual AwakeningWhen people undergo gradual awakening, what is actually happening to them? Howdo spiritual practices and paths bring about changes to our state of being andhelp us move from our normal state of sleep to a state of wakefulness?Gradual awakening is a process of transforming our self-system, slowly alteringand remolding our normal psychological structures and psychological processes insuch a way that we begin to transcend our normal sleep state.The two most significant characteristics of our normal self-system are itshighly individualized and separate sense of “I” (or ego) and its automatizedperception. Meditation is the main way that we transcend the separateness of theego. As a structure, the ego is largely maintained by thinking, so when thinkingbegins to fade (or even just when we become less identified with our thinking),the ego begins to fade. However, dissolving psychological attachments, thebuilding blocks of the ego, can also be an important part of this process. Asthey dissolve away, the ego itself dissolves away, too. (We’ll look at thisprocess of dissolving psychological attachments, an important aspect of suddenawakening, in more detail in the next chapter.) Service and altruism contributeto this process because they have ego-transcending effects. They make us lessego-oriented, less concerned with our own personal needs and desires. Theyweaken the boundaries of our self-system by increasing our connectedness toother people.As the ego aspect becomes weaker and softer, we experience a greater generalsense of connection — to other human beings and living beings, to the naturalworld and the whole universe. We experience a greater sense of inner fullnessand spaciousness now that our identity is no longer limited to the narrowconfines of the ego. We experience a greater sense of well-being now that we’reno longer so identified with our thoughts and no longer experience a sense offragmentation and isolation within our own mental space.There’s an energetic aspect to this, particularly in relation to perception. Ourinner energy becomes reorganized and redistributed. As the ego becomes weaker asa structure, and as its thought-chatter becomes less powerful, more energy isavailable for us to use perceptually. Our perceptions become energized and so nolonger need to be automatic. We wake up to a brighter, more intense world. Weperceive the sentience of the world again, with the spirit-force pervading it.This increased energy contributes to our sense of well-being, too. An abundant,rich, and dynamic life force, whose nature is one of effervescent joy, flowsthrough us.In essence, then, we slowly create a new self-system through spiritual practice(whether it’s voluntary or involuntary). Our sense of “I” is much softer andless dominant, with much weaker boundaries, quieter thought processes, andintensified perception. Our self-system is reshaped into a newhigher-functioning self that is free from the discord that afflicts the normalego-centered separate self, and that can function more harmoniously, moreauthentically, and more beneficially for the world.At the same time, it may not be completely accurate to say that we actuallycreate a new self-system. The wakeful self-system already exists inside us as apotential. It seems to be a kind of mold that our self-system naturally formsinto. We feel instinctively drawn to spiritual practice as a way of manifestingthis new self-system. Spiritual practice seems to naturally allow the wakefulself-system to form in a very slow and incremental way. In a sense, it slowlyundoes our normal self-system, erodes it away so that the latent wakefulself-system can supplant it. It’s not strictly a matter of the new self-systemreplacing the old one but of the old one transforming into a new form.The difference between natural wakefulness and gradual awakening is that, withthe latter, the wakeful self-system has yet to emerge. It’s like a seed, whichhas the impulse to grow but is still dormant and needs to be nurtured. Awakenersare drawn toward spiritual practices and paths as a way of nurturing this seed,whereas in natural wakefulness, it has already blossomed. The wakefulself-system has already emerged and established itself.The idea that this self-system is somehow latent inside us connects toevolution; we’ll investigate this in more detail in the last chapter of thisbook. Everyone who engages in spiritual practice is instinctively moving in thesame direction. They aren’t attempting to remold their self-system according totheir own independent agenda. They’re developing essentially the samecharacteristics; it’s essentially the same type of new self-system that isforming inside them.To me, this suggests that this self-system is latent inside the human race ingeneral, that it has already established itself as a kind of psychologicalstructure or mold. It’s as if a road has already been laid and we’re travelingalong it, following a predetermined course. If this structure wasn’t alreadyestablished, we would all be moving in different directions, developingdifferent characteristics and different varieties of self-systems.You could make another analogy with sex and reproduction. People seem to benaturally drawn to spiritual practice as a method of forming this newself-system in the same way that human beings are drawn to sex in order toreproduce. Once a new human being has been conceived through sex, itsdevelopment proceeds along predetermined lines, from conception to birth toadulthood. A man and a woman don’t actually create a new human being fromnothing. It already exists as a potential form; a blueprint for its developmentalready exists. But a man and a woman facilitate its emergence and itsdevelopment. In the same way, we use spiritual practice to facilitate theemergence of a new kind of self that already exists as a potential and whosepath of development is already established."},{"pageContent":"7. Sudden Awakening: Transformation through Turmoil [part0005.html#rch7]The most common way in which human beings shift into a permanent state ofwakefulness is through a sudden and dramatic transformation triggered by intensepsychological turmoil.Over the last twenty years or so, psychologists have become increasingly awareof the phenomenon of posttraumatic growth. A great deal of research has shownthat people who go through traumatic events such as accidents, serious illness,or divorce often experience positive aftereffects. In the long term, after theinitial intense shock and stress have passed, many people report feeling moreresilient and confident, and more appreciative about their lives. They feel thattheir relationships have become more authentic and fulfilling, and that theyhave a stronger sense of meaning and purpose. They often become interested inspirituality and have a more accepting attitude toward death.In my own research I found that trauma can lead to transformation as well asgrowth — a phenomenon that I call posttraumatic transformation. Intensepsychological turmoil and trauma can generate a sudden and dramatic shift into anew, higher-functioning identity, with a new perspective on life, a newawareness of reality, different cognitive and perceptual functioning, new valuesand goals. This shift isn’t always completely sudden — some people reportundergoing some gradual development (including some temporary awakeningexperiences) before a sudden shift occurs. Other people report a few different“shift” experiences rather than a single one.In my book Out of the Darkness, I call people who undergo this transformationshifters. Shifters feel that they have become different people, that theirprevious selves have dissolved away and new selves have replaced them. As two ofthem told me, “It’s like there are two people — there’s a before and after”;“There’s no going back. I’m a different person now, for the rest of my life.”1[part0027.html#rch7en1]In my research for Out of the Darkness and in many other cases of posttraumatictransformation I’ve investigated since then, I found that shifters share anumber of major characteristics. They feel an intense sense of well-being,appreciation for the ordinary things of life, and gratitude for life itself.They feel less afflicted with worry and anxiety than before theirtransformation, and they have a wider sense of perspective, which means theydon’t ruminate over small problems as much. They also experience intensifiedperception so that the world around them appears more vivid and beautiful; theyfeel a strong connection to nature, other people, and other living beings. Theyreport that their minds have become quieter, with less involuntary mentalchatter. If the chatter is still there, they feel less identified with it. Theycan observe it without becoming immersed in it or letting it affect them.In terms of their lifestyles, shifters tend to be less focused on personal gain;they’re less interested in material things or in their success or achievement.Instead, they’re more focused on their personal and spiritual development andmore concerned for the well-being of others, which expresses itself as kindnessand altruism. This new focus often leads to changes in career — in many cases,they leave behind traditional career paths and begin to work in helpingprofessions. For example, a man who once ran his own architectural businessretrained as a counselor and college tutor. A woman gave up her job as ahigh-powered marketing executive for a medical company and retrained as atherapist for cancer patients.All of these are, of course, characteristics of the wakeful state.I’ve found that this sudden awakening can be triggered by a wide range ofdifferent types of turmoil and trauma: intense stress and upheaval, depression,bereavement, serious illness, disability, alcoholism, and encounters with death(through medical conditions or accidents). The type of turmoil doesn’t seem tobe so important as long as it’s intense and prolonged.Investigating these cases was an incredibly inspiring experience. I met peoplewho had been through some of the most tragic and distressing experiencespossible for human beings to undergo. They didn’t just manage to cope with theirpredicaments but actually emerged from them in transcendent states. Instead ofrepeating experiences I discussed in Out of the Darkness, I’ll describe some ofthe most striking cases of posttraumatic transformation I’ve come across in myPhD research and from other sources since that book was published.Spiritual EmergenciesSpiritual awakening is often a fairly smooth and trouble-free process when itoccurs gradually, as we saw over the last two chapters. As with all processes, aslow and gradual progression gives you the opportunity to adjust to the newexperiences you’re undergoing and the new environments you’re encountering. Itgives you the opportunity to reflect on the process, and to accept andunderstand it. The new characteristics you develop can be integrated withoutdisturbing your stability. The cases of Daniel and Ed in the last chapter arefairly good examples of this. Although their awakenings were initiated andimpelled by some degree of turmoil, their development seems to have been fairlyharmonious and well integrated.However, sudden and dramatic awakening can sometimes involve difficulties. Whena transformation happens suddenly, there’s usually no opportunity forunderstanding, adjustment, or integration. You could compare it to becomingrapidly famous and successful. Many people who become famous or successful veryquickly find it difficult to deal with the drastic changes it brings to theirlives, such as constant attention and pressure, and the sudden lack of privacy.Some people find the change so difficult to cope with that they turn to drugs oralcohol, or they become alienated and depressed. Success or fame is much lesslikely to be destabilizing or disorienting when it builds gradually over a longperiod.The transpersonal psychologist Stanislav Grof makes a useful distinction betweenspiritual emergence and spiritual emergency. Spiritual emergence is gradualspiritual awakening, a slow unfolding that causes little disruption. However,spiritual emergency is sudden spiritual awakening that causes major disruptionto a person’s psychological functioning and impairs their ability to function ineveryday life. In some cases, the disruption may be so severe that it resemblespsychosis.2 [part0027.html#rch7en2] (Interestingly, Grof notes that spiritualemergencies are most frequently triggered by intense emotional and psychologicalturmoil such as bereavement, failure, and loss. As he describes it, “This can beloss of an important relationship, such as death of a child or another closerelative, divorce, or the end of a love affair. Similarly, a series of failuresor loss of a job or property can immediately precede the onset of spiritualemergency.”3 [part0027.html#rch7en3])Over the next two chapters we’ll see some examples of spiritual emergencies.MaritaMarita’s awakening occurred during a period of intense turmoil when her childrenwere babies. After her second baby was born (while her first baby was two yearsold), she began to suffer from postnatal depression. Her two-year-old childbecame disruptive and demanding, and she found it impossible to cope. As shedescribed it:I entered in retrospect what was probably a psychotic state. . . . My mind wasfixated on scenarios of misunderstandings and suffering and torture of millionsof children and I stopped sleeping at night, my mind just kept spinning thesestories. I spent my days just holding my children and crying with them. . . .Needless to say, after four nights of not sleeping I was not in great shape.Physically I was wrecked. My sinuses were completely clogged, and my lungs werevery congested. I was talking in whispers, because my throat was so tight. Myhusband was very alarmed and was threatening to get me some help. I had ceasedto function. No groceries had gotten bought, and no laundry got done that week.Marita’s shift was so sudden and dramatic that she can pinpoint the exact momentwhen it occurred: “March 2, 1993, about 8:30 am, Eastern Standard Time US.” Ithappened when her husband was getting ready to go to work and exploded infrustration because he couldn’t find any clean clothes. As Marita described it:With a cry of absolute despair he left the bedroom, slamming the door and thenhe proceeded to destroy the house. He ripped curtains off the walls, he threwthings down the stairs. I’d never seen anyone go berserk like that before. Hisexplosion, and the release of his anger freed something tremendous in me! It wasat that moment that I had an experience of enlightenment.This experience came with feelings of such perfect joy and peace. I rememberthinking afterward “so that’s what I’m supposed to feel like!” This experiencewas multidimensional. It was physical. I felt a tremendous amount of energycoursing through my body and with the energy came healing. My sinuses clearedinstantly, and my lungs cleared out and started working perfectly again. Iwatched this instant healing with amazement. It was intellectual. The finalpuzzle piece dropped into place. It was “eureka” of course!Spiritual knowledge was revealed to me. I “knew” it in an instant and am stillto this day learning in a linear conscious fashion what was revealed to me inthat instant. I also felt like a ton of stuff went blowing by me and I didn’tpick up on most of it — though I have spent seventeen years actively studyingand seeking to put this information together into a state that can be perceivedwith the human mind and heart. . . .I understood about why mystics have talked about “for all eternity.” In amystical consciousness, within that one instant, you sense forever and ever, andare forever changed. I guess that was also what was meant by being born again,to see with the eyes of a child. It was amazing that these forgotten teachingsfrom a Christian upbringing were springing to life for me. I had never “got it”before, looking at it in a logical way.[The next few weeks] were an incredible time that I will never forget and canstill access. I felt like I had broken through a barrier, and I was talking backto people left on the other side, and I so wanted to grab them and pull themthrough with me! I remember feeling a tremendous sense of urgency that I had towrite a book and get this information out. . . . The “spiritual” experiencesthat I had had previously to this experience I had never connected with, sincethey didn’t fit into my worldview. They now immediately took on tremendoussignificance, as I realized how every moment in my life had led up to thatmoment.As is often the case with posttraumatic transformation, Marita’s initiallyintense wakefulness faded slightly, but this less intense wakefulness became hernormal state, which, at the time I spoke to her, she had remained in forseventeen years. One of the most significant changes brought on by her new stateis a strong sense of connection, an awareness of what she described as an“energetic space” that links living beings together. Another significant changeis her love of doing nothing, which she sees as an opportunity to “listen and beopen and connect to something peaceful.” Although she still experiencesthought-chatter, she feels less identified with it and less affected by it. Ifnegative thoughts arise in her mind, she is able to let them pass by before theycreate anxiety or worry. Her attitude toward death has also changed. Not only isshe no longer afraid of it, but she also thinks of death as a return to thattimeless, expansive state she experienced initially: “Being in that ‘outside oftime / outside of space’ place, I guess you’d have to say that [death] is likestepping outside of prison walls, of which it will be very nice to go back homeagain.”However, Marita’s transition from normal consciousness to an ongoing, stablestate of wakefulness wasn’t easy. Despite the intense well-being she experiencedand her newfound insights, she felt confused by her new state. It took a longtime for her to integrate the new aspects of her identity. As she told me, “Iwas really blown apart and needed to do a lot of work and seeking to integrateand figure out how to live with this new person I was.” She found relationshipsparticularly difficult; she lost the social and communication skills she’dpreviously had and hurt and offended people by being too honest. Even afterseventeen years, she felt that this process of integration was still ongoing,although largely complete. (We’ll examine the difficulties that often arise withsudden transformation in more detail in chapter 8[part0015.html#E9OE0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5].)JC’s TransformationJC Mac, as he calls himself, is a Canadian in his late fifties who underwent adramatic and difficult awakening at the age of forty-five. Before this time, hehad some psychic experiences but not any spiritual experiences that he canrecall. He had been a musician — not a very successful one, despite his bestefforts — and his rock-and-roll lifestyle had led to problems with drugs.However, he had managed to overcome drug addiction and had worked as a drug andalcohol counselor in detox and treatment centers, designing rehabilitationprograms for addicts. At the same time, he still pursued his musical ambitionsand eventually recorded an album. He recognizes that throughout his early lifehe had a strong need for affirmation and attention, which he channeled intomusic.Partly due to his overpowering desire for success, JC became estranged from hiswife. His marriage broke down, and he left the family home, including his threechildren. Following his counseling role, he developed a career as a personaldevelopment coach, but his business began to fail, leaving him with financialproblems. He felt under intense stress and struggled with the disruption to hispreviously stable life.In the midst of this upheaval and turmoil he underwent a sudden shift inconsciousness. One day he found himself crying, without knowing exactly why, andexperienced a strange slowing down of time, along with a sense of inner peace.There were physical manifestations, too: a sensation of pins and needles in hisarms and legs, which made him think he was having a heart attack or stroke.Naturally, he was afraid, but then he remembered a phrase from a Zen monk: “Allfear is illusion, walk straight ahead.” This encouraged him to stop resistingand allow himself to flow with the process that was unfolding. He described theprocess as being “like a set of dominoes falling over. I began to let goeverything in life . . .and went into this state of bliss. All mentationdisappeared and everything began to radiate this stunning sense of beauty,stillness, and silence.”This state of bliss became ongoing for JC, but there were problems, too. Hebegan to find the practical, organizational side of life difficult to deal with.He couldn’t work and found it difficult to relate to other people. He oftenforgot to eat and lost a lot of weight as a result. There was a “dark night ofthe soul” period in which he felt that he was “being abandoned by God” andreturning to a state of painful duality. However, he began to realize he wasactually undergoing a process of integration, of relearning mental functions andpractical abilities at the same time as retaining his sense of peace and newidentity.This process of integration was a long one. At the time I spoke to JC, it hadbeen six years since his shift, and he felt that he was “still working on it.”As he described it: “I’ve been in and out of mind for the last six years. Thesense of peace and stillness is always pervading [but] it’s difficult tofunction sometimes, with the things that require mind, organizing. It’sinconvenient, in a linear Western world when things are run on schedules, to bein a nonlinear state.”JC described the main ways in which his awareness and his perspective havechanged as a result of his shift:I have no sense of identity. If you have a sense of identity, you cut off thealternatives. I don’t consider myself American or Canadian. There is noparticular place which is home. There’s an all-pervading still silence, and it’salways there wherever I go.My mind is very quiet most of the time. . . . There is nothing there apart froma still silence, a very peaceful still unifying silence that permeateseverything. Then you ask a question and the faculty of speech is triggered. It’sbeautiful but inconvenient. Thinking is highly overrated. I don’t have a problemwith thinking, but if you can’t distinguish your thinking for what it really isyou’re going to suffer. The ego is just something that has developed overmillennia to help us survive.There’s no attachment to material things, which is a relief. Before I wasattached to my body, to success, or what I wanted to become. Being of service toall things is all, in the name of the highest good. To serve humanity, that’s myintention.Encounters with Death as Triggers for Sudden AwakeningAlthough a wide range of traumatic experiences can give rise to suddenawakening, one particular type is more strongly associated with the shift thanany other: an intense encounter with death. This may mean encountering deathpersonally through an illness or accident, or encountering it through the deathof a person close to us — that is, through bereavement.Research shows that encounters with mortality are a powerful source ofposttraumatic growth. In particular, studies show that cancer patients whobecome aware that they may only have a short time left to live often experienceit. In the months following diagnosis, many cancer patients report feeling moreself-confident and appreciative of life, and that their relationships arestronger and more authentic.4 [part0027.html#rch7en4] (They also report a higherlevel of spirituality.) Studies of people who have experienced other chronicillnesses, natural disasters, and life-threatening combat situations showsimilar findings.5 [part0027.html#rch7en5] Bereavement has been shown togenerate posttraumatic growth, too.6 [part0027.html#rch7en6]People who survive near-death experiences also feel permanently changed for thebetter. As described in chapter 2[part0009.html#8IL20-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5], in near-deathexperiences, people “die” for a short time (most frequently due to a cardiacarrest) but find that they continue to be conscious. In most cases, they leavetheir bodies, feel that they are moving or gliding through darkness toward alight, and encounter deceased relatives or “beings” of some form who speak tothem. As you would expect, these experiences have powerful aftereffects. TheDutch cardiologist Pim van Lommel followed sixty-two people who had near-deathexperiences and found that almost all of them experienced a major shift inperspective and values. After their near-death experiences they became lessinterested in material wealth and personal success; they felt an increased senseof connection to nature, together with an increased capacity for love andcompassion, both for themselves and others. As van Lommel puts it, “Thelong-lasting transformational effects of an experience that lasts only a fewminutes was a surprising and unexpected finding.”7 [part0027.html#rch7en7]Another researcher, Michael Sabom, found that people who had had near-deathexperiences several years ago reported an increased sense of meaning, a greatercapacity for love, and a greater involvement with their family.8[part0027.html#rch7en8] There’s no doubt that this shift is largely due to thecontent of the near-death experience and the new picture of reality that itreveals; that is, there may be life after death, and the nature of the universeis love and harmony. But it’s also likely that the shift is partly due toencountering death.Cancer and Sudden AwakeningIn addition to generating posttraumatic growth, a diagnosis of cancer can(although not as frequently) lead to posttraumatic transformation. I reportedsome cases of this in Out of the Darkness. For example, Irene was diagnosed withbreast cancer and told she probably had only one year left to live. Hertransformation was almost instantaneous. The morning after being told that shehad cancer, she woke up to a different world in which “the air was so clean andfresh and everything I looked at seemed so vibrant and vivid. The trees were sogreen and everything was so alive. I became aware of this energy radiating fromthe trees, and had this tremendous feeling of connectedness. It was fantastic. Ijust felt so fortunate to be alive on this planet.”9 [part0027.html#rch7en9]Although it was especially intense for the next few weeks, this expanded andintensified awareness became Irene’s normal state for the next thirteen years.At that point, sadly, her cancer came back and she died soon afterward.Hugh Martin, who was seventy years old at the time I interviewed him, is anotherexample. He underwent posttraumatic transformation in his midtwenties afterbeing diagnosed with Hodgkin’s disease — cancer of the lymph system — and toldthat he had no more than two years left to live. He defied his doctors andrecovered, and although it has been over forty years since his diagnosis, theshift he experienced then has never faded. As he told me, “It’s a great blessingto experience first-hand the brevity of life. It teaches you to savour everymoment, and inspires you to live life at a level you never dreamed possible.”10[part0027.html#rch7en10]There was also a powerful example of posttraumatic transformation through cancerin the British media recently. Rock guitarist Wilko Johnson, best known as amember of the band Dr. Feelgood, was diagnosed with stomach cancer and told heonly had eight or nine months to live. Speaking a few weeks after his diagnosis,Johnson said that he had been feeling “vividly alive” and experiencing a senseof euphoria, with “this marvellous feeling of freedom.” In a similar way toIrene, his sense of euphoria began as soon as he was told the news. As he toldthe BBC:We walked out of [the consulting room] and I felt an elation of spirit. You’rewalking along and suddenly you’re vividly alive. You’re looking at the trees andthe sky and everything and it’s just “whoah!” I am actually a miserable person.I’ve spent most of my life moping in depressions and things, but this has alllifted. . . . The things that used to bring me down, or worry me, or annoy me,they don’t matter anymore — and that’s when you sit thinking, “Wow, why didn’t Iwork this out before? Why didn’t I work out before that it’s just the momentyou’re in that matters?”Worrying about the future or regretting the past is just a foolish waste oftime. Of course we can’t all be threatened with imminent death, but it probablytakes that to knock a bit of sense into our heads. Right now it’s justfantastic; it makes you feel alive. Just walking down the street you really feelalive. Every little thing you see, every cold breeze against your face, everybrick in the road, you think “I’m alive, I’m alive.”11 [part0027.html#rch7en11]There’s a twist to Wilko’s story. He calmly accepted the fact that he was goingto die and refused chemotherapy. However, after nine months his health stillhadn’t begun to deteriorate, and he became puzzled. He went to see a cancerspecialist, who told him that he had a rare type of tumor that was actuallyoperable, although there was just a 15 percent chance of surviving an operation.During a nine-hour-long procedure, a giant tumor was removed from his stomach,and, after a period of convalescence, he was recently pronounced cancer-free. Sonow — at the time of writing — he is adjusting to the fact that he isn’t facingimminent death after all.Awakening through BereavementThe death of a person close to us is the only experience that has a similarcapacity to induce sudden awakening as encountering death ourselves. Bereavementcan create a seismic shock, completely upturning the stability of our lives andminds. The world suddenly seems like a completely different place, in whichnothing is certain or permanent and all of our previous ambitions and activitiesseem meaningless and absurd. The searing pain of loss may make it difficult tocarry on living ourselves. The pain may take years to heal, or perhaps it willnever heal. But at the same time, the intense and destabilizing experience ofbereavement can have a powerful transformational effect.I also included some examples of awakening through bereavement in Out of theDarkness, most notably, the case of Glyn Hood, who underwent a sudden shift intowakefulness eighteen months after the sudden death of her daughter. Since then,I’ve come across other striking cases, two of which I’ll describe here.The first case is one of the most tragic — and, at the same time, mostinspirational — stories I’ve ever come across. Graham Stew contacted me when Iwas looking for participants for my PhD research project on spiritual awakening.He was a university lecturer, like me, although since his shift he had becomeless identified with this role and now only taught part-time. He was differentfrom most of the people I spoke to in that he had a deep interest inspirituality before his shift occurred. He learned meditation as a teenager andfollowed the path of Buddhism for many years. As a result, he had someunderstanding of spiritual awakening and some degree of spiritual development.This was good preparation for the shift he experienced that, in his words, “gaveme the final push which helped me realize the truth of everything I’d beenreading.”Graham’s shift was triggered by two bereavements in close succession. His wifewas diagnosed with advanced and untreatable lung cancer. Her conditiondeteriorated quickly — within a few months, she was dependent on oxygen and haddifficulty walking more than a few steps. Nevertheless, she was determined tosurvive at least until the end of the year so that she could spend a finalChristmas with their seventeen-year-old son.However, that October their son was killed in a car crash on his way to a party.The shock brought about a rapid decline in his mother’s condition — in fact, shepassed away the evening of his funeral.Apart from the pain and shock of these events — and having to deal with thepractical business of organizing the funerals, registering the deaths, andwriting to friends and relatives to let them know about the deaths — Graham felta loss of identity. As he put it, “Almost overnight I had lost two importantroles in my life: I had been a husband for twenty-two years and a father forseventeen years. The sense of who I was had been stripped away, and I was leftstaring at emptiness.”Graham was helped by Buddhist teachings on impermanence and change and also bythe Buddhist practice of observing and exploring mental and emotional states. Hewas aware of the importance of acknowledging his feelings of emptiness and knewthat he had to let go of resistance to them. Through doing this, he became awarethat, in his words, “within the emptiness there was a stillness that somehowreassured me that all was well.”In Out of the Darkness I highlighted the importance of acceptance in theseexperiences. Acceptance has an alchemical power that releases thetransformational potential of turmoil and trauma. A person has to let go oftheir resistance to their predicament, to surrender to it and accept it. In manycases, a shift occurs at exactly the same moment that a person lets go andsurrenders to their predicament.Through exploring and accepting his pain and emptiness, Graham underwent ashift. The emptiness he experienced was a positive state of ego-transcendencerather than a bleak or hostile vacuum. As he described it: “It shattered thethin shell of my ego. . . . I could see through the illusion of separateness.All those years I’d been looking for a pair of glasses which I was alreadyseeing out of. The idea that all was one had been an intellectual concept, butnow it’s become real. It’s what it is. I can’t imagine not seeing it now.”I interviewed Graham eleven years after these tragic but transformationalevents. He described how, since his shift, he feels much more present-centered,with a heightened awareness and a greater appreciation of simple pleasures. Heis filled with a sense of ease and acceptance and less identified with his ownthoughts and emotions:Life has become a lot easier. I’m able to live more in the present moment andvalue that. Attachments that I had before have been loosed a great deal. Worriesabout money, about future work, about relationships, have lost their strength. .. . Now everything that comes along is okay. I can say yes to life whatever itbrings whereas before I used to have conditions.It gives me a sense of ease. Life just seems easy. There are still problems;it’s not a state of bliss. Moods come and go. But I can see it, I’m aware of it.I can let it go. There’s a sense of appreciation of the simple things — a simplecup of tea, looking out of the window, the sunshine on the leaves, the wonderfulgreen of the trees. I never bothered to pay much attention in the past. I’mstruck by how fresh everything seems, how wonderful it is to be here at all.There’s a sense of wonder, like a young child — I’ve got it back. I canappreciate just walking out the front door, feeling the wind on my face. . . .My mind still chatters away — that’s part of being human. Sometimes I need tolisten to it because I have things which need planning — going shopping, payingthe bills. It’s a useful machine. I can pay less attention to it now. It’s likewalking into another room, with the TV playing in the background. I don’t haveto pay attention to it. Before thoughts that were emotionally charged used tocome up and I’d get hijacked by them, taken away on trains of thoughts into thefuture and the past. I don’t do that now; I tend to get less caught up in itnow. . . .I’m happy to sit in my garden and just watch the flowers and listen to thebirds. I can happily listen to music and read for hours. I am less sociable thanI was, not that I was ever party-loving, and am quite content with a simplelife. I can relish a simple cup of tea, and marvel at the sheer miracle of beinghere at all.I don’t have any ambition anymore — that all slipped away. I wasn’t worriedanymore about how I appear to colleagues, about publishing articles. One day Imight write a book, but there doesn’t seem to be any urgency. . . .12[part0027.html#rch7en12]Time has changed in that it’s always now. Everything that I’m aware of arisesout of this awareness. The world arises in us. It’s also a mystery because wecan’t describe it.Graham described how his relationships have changed, too. He is more friendlyand relaxed, less prone to becoming annoyed or irritable with people. As he toldme, “It feels more comfortable because I don’t have an ego which I need toprotect and defend. Without that worry everything seems a lot easier.”PhoebePhoebe, who contacted me after reading Waking from Sleep, is another strikingexample of awakening through bereavement. Phoebe wrote to me to say that she’dhad a “very high-intensity awakening experience” following the death of herfriend.Amanda, Phoebe’s friend, was only twenty when she was killed by a drunk driverwhile riding her bike. At Amanda’s funeral, Phoebe’s initial shock and sorrowgave way to a sense of “total bliss and peace with the impermanence of allbodies and forms.” While she was writing a farewell note to Amanda, she sensedher presence. In Phoebe’s own words:I saw her face, except it wasn’t physical. In fact, I completely lost the sensethat there was a physical world around me. We were together, and we were one andthe same. Her presence was one of pure love and peace. There were clearly nodifferences between us even though I was still in a body and she wasn’t. Shesaid, “Phoebe, live your life to the absolute fullest while you’re still onEarth.” Her voice felt like it was being spoken through me rather than to me.For the next two or so days, I was in a state of total peace and bliss.Everything physical was unstable and subject to decay, and that was completelyokay with me. I was at peace with the fact that I was going to die, and it trulydidn’t matter to me when that would happen. I felt profound love and gratitudetoward everyone in my life, everyone who was alive, and for everything I saw andexperienced. It was clear to me that negativity of any kind had no power and wasinfinitely small compared with the vastness of life itself.After this initial awakening experience, Phoebe felt that she was looking at herlife with new eyes, with a completely different perspective. As she said, “WhenI went back to the small Quaker liberal arts college I was attending, I felt asif I had been dropped there from another planet.” Her previous life seemed aliento her, and she had a strong sense that she was “awake” in some way, even thoughshe didn’t fully understand what that meant. She became, in her words, “highlysensitive to the energies of spaces and people,” able to perceive subtlevibrations outside solid forms.She experienced an opening of consciousness, which brought revelations about thenature of human life. She had visions of the cycles of human life, humanhistory, the whole evolution of life on this planet, and how they are allinterlinked. As she described it:I could see cycles within larger cycles within even larger cycles: a day betweenwaking and bedtime, a year between early spring and the next winter, a stage ofdevelopment between its beginning and end, a lifetime between birth and death,an era between its beginning and end, and the life spans of planets and stars.Even the life of the universe between the Big Bang and its final contractionmirrors these. I could see that in the evolution of life, life-forms and livingsystems increase in complexity, cooperation, efficiency, intelligence, andawareness.Soon after this she had what she described as a “great opening” in which shebecame aware of “the Source of all existence.” In her words:This came right after several days of sensing deeply that everything Iencountered — furniture, hair, paper, clothes, music, food, soap, bodies, minds,thoughts, reactions, plans, cities, cars, trees, clouds, and more — had anunspeakably complex history that was inseparable from the history of the wholeuniverse and everything else in it. Everything simple looked magnificent instill observation. I saw that bed sheets, jeans, and wood floors were incrediblycomplex, and I felt that I was seeing many secrets of life that had been hiddenin front of my eyes all along. . . . I saw that there was a vast life that wasthe Source of everything that was and ever will be. I was not seeing with myeyes, but with the core of my being. I saw our universe, all physical space, allother universes, and everything that changes as one tiny dark finite specksurrounded by an infinite sea of life and light. I saw even more clearly life’snature of pure love, bliss, creativity, and wisdom. This sea of pure life isformless and spacious, and yet it is fully conscious and intelligent. It is theonly true experiencer, the only true “I.” The Source is present everywhere andin every moment whether we are aware of it or not.As this great being showed Him/Herself to me, I could see that the pure divinelife that is Him/Her is the same life that is the essence of every being throughall space and time. The formless gives birth to all forms. Every taste, opinion,personality, and experience grows out of pure divine. . . .I absolutely knew without a doubt that this is God. God showed me that S/he iscreating, shaping, and evolving forms and worlds in much the way an artistcreates masterpieces. God/spirit exists outside of time and does not needanything in order to be, and yet life expresses itself through form because ofits creative nature.But there were difficulties, too. Phoebe’s experience was a spiritual emergencythat caused an earthquake-like disturbance to her psyche. Such a sudden andpowerful opening inevitably disrupted her normal psychological functions. Shebecame highly emotional and often felt disoriented and exhausted. She hadproblems with memory and found it difficult to communicate and do simpleeveryday tasks.However, Phoebe was fortunate in that she had some knowledge of Buddhism andspiritual Christianity and had read modern spiritual authors such as EckhartTolle. She had a framework to make sense of her experiences and was aware thatshe was undergoing a profound positive transformation rather than a breakdown.Like JC Mac, she had to go through a process of relearning and rebuilding as theshift began to settle.At the time Phoebe wrote to me, it had been four years since her awakening. Shehad recovered her psychological functions and was able to operate pretty well inthe everyday world again, even though she still felt that the process ofintegration wasn’t yet complete. The intensity of her initial transformation hadfaded and settled into a steady and stable ongoing form of wakefulness. As shedescribed it, her awareness of a “spacious presence behind and within allexperience has never left me, though sometimes it is more in the foreground orbackground. . . . The space of now — life itself — transcends all phenomena,experiences, and circumstances. The light is infinitely greater and morepowerful than all burdens, darkness, and suffering. God is all there is.”Understanding Posttraumatic TransformationWhy is there such a strong relationship between turmoil and transformation? Inpsychological terms, what actually happens when a person undergoes awakening inthe midst of intense stress or trauma?We touched on this issue in chapters 5[part0012.html#BE6O0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5] and 6[part0012.html#BE6O0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5], in relation torenunciation and letting go of psychological attachments. We saw that gradualspiritual awakening is often related to a process of loss in which a person’spsychological attachments are slowly dissolved away. This might happen as aresult of illness, professional failure, alcoholism, and other negative events.Attachments such as hopes, beliefs, status, and possessions are the buildingblocks of our identity, so as they are broken down, our identity — in fact, ourwhole self-system — breaks down, too. This can lead to intense turmoil anddespair, but it can also allow a new self to emerge. As the old self breaksdown, a new, higher-functioning self emerges to replace it — that is, thewakeful self-system. We also saw that people who follow traditional spiritualpaths often practice renunciation; that is, they make conscious efforts todissolve their psychological attachments through voluntary poverty and celibacy,turning away from worldly ambitions, and so on.The same process occurs in posttraumatic transformation, but the new wakefulself-system emerges suddenly and dramatically rather than gradually. The mostimportant aspect of the process is the breakdown of the old self-system. Whilethis can occur gradually, it’s much more common for it to occur suddenly. Thiscan happen through intense stress, when the old self-system can no longerwithstand the pressure and suddenly breaks down, like a building in anearthquake. Or it can happen when the old self-system is so weakened by the lossof its attachments that it simply gives way, like a building that has lost somany bricks that it can no longer keep its form and falls down. As a result,there’s suddenly a great open space of being that was filled by the previousself-system. A new, higher-functioning self-system — an awakened self withsofter boundaries, heightened awareness, and reduced cognitive activity —emerges to fill the vacuum, like a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis.Why Some and Not Others?Why does this higher-functioning, awakened self emerge in some people but not inothers? After all, almost everyone goes through intense turmoil at some point intheir lives, but most people experience a breakdown without a shift-up into anew state of being. In doing my research in this area, I was constantlysurprised at how easy it was to find examples of people who had undergone thisshift. This led me to conclude that posttraumatic transformation — and thereforethe state of wakefulness itself — is much more common than is generallybelieved. I found that most people who underwent the shift had no previousknowledge of spiritual traditions or practices (which sometimes meant that theywere confused by their new state). I now have a strong feeling that there aremany unknown awakened individuals all around us who don’t fully understand whathas happened to them. Nevertheless, posttraumatic transformation is still quiterare; the great majority of people who go through intense turmoil and traumadon’t experience transformation.Whether we experience posttraumatic transformation or not depends largely on howwe respond to turmoil and trauma. There are two important prerequisites oftransformation: acknowledgment and acceptance. In order for transformation tooccur, a person first has to face up to their predicament rather than divert ordistract themselves from it. All too often, people who are suffering from traumadon’t do this, as a self-protective mechanism. They deceive themselves thattheir predicament isn’t as serious as it actually is or simply avoidcontemplating it. Acknowledgment (or facing up) is an act of courage. It meansconfronting intense loss and pain. But without it, the positive transformationaleffects of turmoil and trauma can’t manifest themselves.Once a person has found the courage to face up to the reality of theirpredicament, they are able to take the second step of accepting theirpredicament. This attitude of acceptance — of ceasing to resist theirpredicament, of letting go or surrendering to it — is absolutely essential inposttraumatic transformation. The moment of acceptance is often also thespecific moment when transformation occurs. An attitude of acceptance has aseemingly alchemical power of transmuting suffering and turmoil into positivetransformation. Acceptance is often the trigger that allows a person’s latenthigher self to emerge and replace the broken fragments of the old self that hasbeen damaged so badly by loss or turmoil.I’ve come across a lot of cases of posttraumatic transformation triggered bytherapy. Of the twenty-five cases of spiritual awakening I studied in my PhDthesis, for example, five occurred while people were undergoing some form ofpsychotherapy or counseling.13 [part0027.html#rch7en13] Therapy seems to unlocka person’s turmoil and create an opening through which a new self-system canemerge. If the therapeutic environment is safe and supportive — and if thetherapist is skilled — counseling may create the right conditions for a personto acknowledge their turmoil and trauma and then let go of their resistance toit. They may feel able to step back and surrender to their predicament, whichallows transformation to take place.Perhaps most fundamentally though, transformation through psychological turmoilis related to a person’s readiness for spiritual awakening.I interpret awakening and wakefulness in evolutionary terms. I see the wakefulstate as an evolutionary progression, the next phase of human development.Wakefulness is a more expansive and intensified state of awareness in the sameway that our present normal state is more expansive and intensified than, say, asheep’s or a dog’s state of awareness. As I will explain in the final chapter ofthis book, I believe this state will one day become human beings’ normal one.The wakeful state is therefore latent inside the human race as a whole and isbeginning to manifest and express itself. We see its expression in theincreasing frequency of temporary awakening experiences in people, the buildupof the impulse to awaken in people (which expresses itself through the impulseto follow spiritual practices and paths), and the increasing latency ofwakefulness in individuals. The higher self-system of wakefulness is latent insome people; it has already formed but has not yet manifested itself. It may beunable to express itself because it’s being blocked by their presentself-system. However, when their psychological attachments dissolve away andtheir normal self-system breaks down, this latent higher self is able to emergeand establish itself. It becomes their new identity. Many people who undergoposttraumatic transformation describe feeling as if they have been reborn, as ifthey are a different person inhabiting the same body. And in the same way thatactual physical birth can be a difficult process, this birth of a new identityis often problematic.In most people, the wakeful self-system is probably not ready to emerge. It hasnot yet become fully formed or integrated as a structure. So when these peopleexperience turmoil and trauma and the dissolution of their psychologicalattachments, they experience a breakdown without a shift-up. Their normalself-system breaks down with nothing to replace it. There’s just a psychicvacuum inside them, which is not filled by a latent higher self. Their higherself isn’t yet ready to be born.14 [part0027.html#rch7en14]When Transformation Is Both Gradual and SuddenAs I noted at the beginning of this chapter, there’s no hard and fast divisionbetween gradual and sudden transformation. In my PhD research, I found six caseswhere transformation was both gradual and permanent; that is, the suddentransformation was preceded by a long period of gradual awakening. In fact, along period of gradual awakening may make a person more likely to undergo suddentransformation.In most cases, posttraumatic transformation occurs when the person is in themidst of intense turmoil and stress. However, there may be a delay in somecases. A person may initially experience only the traumatic aspects of theirexperiences, but a long period of spiritual practice, which induces gradualspiritual awakening, may allow a sudden posttraumatic transformation to occurlater.My friend and mentor Russel Williams is a good example of this delay. Hisawakening was undoubtedly connected to the intense turmoil and trauma heunderwent in his early life. As he describes in his book Not I, Not Other Than I(which I edited), Russel was born in 1921 and left school at the age of eleven,following the death of his father. Even more tragically, his mother died shortlyafterward, and he spent the next few years struggling to survive, doingincredibly hard manual and menial work for very low pay. He also experiencedintense trauma during the Second World War — he was at Dunkirk, in London duringthe Blitz, and came close to death on several other occasions.His sudden transformation occurred five years after the war, after he had spentthree years in a kind of involuntary spiritual practice of looking after horsesin a circus (as described in the previous chapter). This is how Russel describeshis moment of transformation:I woke up one morning and looked across at the horses, watching the steam riseout of their nostrils the way it does on a cold morning. The next thing I knew Iwasn’t just observing the horse, from the outside. I was the horse. I waslooking inside it. I was it. I could look through its eyes and mind. I was awareof its true nature. I was aware that all things are one. There was a sense ofprofound peace within me.It was a revelation. I looked at another horse, and another, and I was insidethem as well. I looked at one of the dogs, and saw it in its true nature, too. Isaw everything in its true nature. I went outside to look at the lions and itwas the same with them — looking from the inside out, not the outside in. Wewere all the same nature, all arising from the same source. My own nature wasjust as theirs was, in a different form, with one consciousness linking us alltogether. They were only separate in terms of form and structure. It was thesame essence, the same emptiness, in all of them — in all of us. I went outsideto look at the trees, and they were the same nature. Then I looked at my ownbody, and inside myself, and there was nobody there. My normal sense of self haddisappeared. At that moment there was no more anger, no frustration, just asense of peace. There was no desire, no aversion; everything was as it shouldbe.15 [part0027.html#rch7en15]It seems, then, that Russel’s three years of involuntary spiritual practicecreated the conditions — including the attitude of openness and acceptance —that allowed the transformation potential of his traumatic experiences tomanifest itself.Another way in which transformation can be both gradual and sudden is when theprocess is spread over several different transformational experiences ratherthan concentrated into one sudden shift. The normal self-system doesn’t dissolvein one fell swoop but over a few separate incidences of loss or turmoil, like acastle that’s broken down over a few separate attacks. One person I intervieweddescribed three individual transformational experiences — each triggered byintense psychological turmoil — over a period of nine years. Each experience ledto a more intense state of wakefulness; the last one led to a permanent andstable state. Another participant described “five or six moments of clarity”that were followed by what he describes as “the usual spiritual seeking,” untila period of intense turmoil generated a shift into a permanently wakeful state.However, it’s fitting that different varieties of wakefulness merge into oneanother and are sometimes difficult to distinguish. After all, we’re dealingwith a state in which duality falls away and boundaries no longer exist. Theexperiential landscape of wakefulness is terra incognita for most of us, so it’simportant to try to map it to some degree, to provide some orientation anddirection so that we don’t become lost or confused. But at the same time, weshould avoid unnecessary dividing lines and distinctions."},{"pageContent":"8. Sudden Awakening: Kundalini and Energetic Awakening [part0005.html#rch8]The cases of sudden awakening that we’ve looked at so far can be described asexperiences of ego-dissolution in which loss, trauma, and turmoil dissolve awaya person’s psychological attachments and, in the process, their ego and theirentire self-system. But some sudden awakenings occur in a slightly differentform. I call these energetic awakenings, which are more explosive and dramatic.Energetic awakenings also lead to a breakdown of the normal self-system, butthis occurs in a more violent way.You could use an analogy of the destruction of a house. In ego-dissolution, it’sas if the house is slowly dismantled — the building blocks of psychologicalattachments are gradually taken away. But in energetic awakening, it’s as if thehouse is suddenly demolished, like a beach house swept away by a tidal wave.These are spiritual emergencies of the most intense and dramatic kind.Kundalini AwakeningIn the Indian spiritual traditions of Yoga and Tantra, sudden energeticawakenings are depicted as kundalini awakening. As described in chapter 5[part0012.html#BE6O0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5], kundalini — derived fromthe Sanskrit word kunda, meaning “to coil” or “to spiral” — is an intense andexplosive form of energy that lies dormant in the first and lowest of the sevenchakras (or energy centers), the muladhara. When this energy travels up to thehighest chakra, near the crown of the head, it results in spiritual awakening.Many contemporary spiritual researchers and transpersonal psychologists havestudied the phenomenon of kundalini awakening, mainly focusing on the negativeeffects that occur when kundalini rises suddenly and dramatically. According tothe researcher Bruce Greyson, for example, this can cause major disruptions topsychological functioning that resembles psychiatric disorders and often resultin a misdiagnosis of mental illness.1 [part0027.html#rch8en1] Other researchersnote that it can also cause physical problems, including involuntary spasms andvibrations, burning or itching sensations, and lethargy. People may hear voices,see visions of light, and have psychic experiences.2 [part0027.html#rch8en2]Interestingly, traditional Indian texts devote very little attention to theseproblems. At most, they hint at the potential volatility of the energy,describing it as “a ring of lightning, folds of flaming fire”3[part0027.html#rch8en3] or as “fiery energy” that releases “dazzling sparks.”4[part0027.html#rch8en4] The Vijnanabhairavatantra, a Tantric text, describes howdepression and fatigue can occur if kundalini energy happens to move back downthrough the chakras instead of rising up. This text also mentions that if theyogi hasn’t entirely transcended their sense of identification with the body,they may experience uncontrollable trembling.Presumably the reason why these texts don’t explore the difficulties ofkundalini awakening is because the awakening process occurred in the controlledcontext of monastic and spiritual traditions, under the supervision of gurus,with a great deal of understanding and preparation. Under these circumstances,such difficulties are probably less likely to occur. This highlights the pointI’ve already made (and a subject we’ll investigate fully in chapter 10[part0017.html#G6PI0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5]): awakening is much morelikely to be disruptive when a person isn’t prepared for it and doesn’t have aframework to make sense of it, and also when it occurs in a nonsupportiveenvironment.Cases of Energetic Awakening from My ResearchEnergetic awakenings — or kundalini awakenings — are common, although not ascommon as awakenings through ego-dissolution. In my PhD research, for example, Ifound five clear cases of energetic kundalini-like awakenings out oftwenty-five, as well as two other possible ones. Like most other cases of suddenawakening, the cases I investigated were mainly triggered by intensepsychological turmoil, with the slight difference that they were more likely tobe triggered by intense stress (often manifesting as sleeplessness) rather thanthrough factors such as failure or loss.Kimberley, a case from my PhD research, experienced awakening through explosiveenergy release shortly after the death of her mother. One morning, while lyingin bed, she sensed her mother’s presence and suddenly she felt she couldn’t moveher body or open her eyes. She felt heat and bright light around her body andfelt frightened but somehow reassured at the same time. Over the next few days,she had a feeling of “energy rising through my body with a loud screechingsound.” At night, when she closed her eyes, she saw visions of colors andsymbols, and “random information at a very, very high speed, like a slideshow,showing frames throughout human history.” During her waking hours, she wasacutely sensitive to other people; she was able to sense their feelings andthoughts and see colors around them.Kimberley had no knowledge of spirituality or esoteric ideas and so struggled tomake sense of her experiences. She suspected that she had “gone mad,” eventhough she was sure that her experiences were real and that she had entered aheightened reality rather than a hallucinatory one. For several weeks, she wasunable to work or function in everyday life. She was diagnosed with depressionand found it difficult to sleep. She had problems focusing her attention andholding on to information with her mind. Sensing that conventional medicinecouldn’t help her, she turned to alternative therapies, which she felt helped tointegrate her new state of being. Overall, it “took two to three years to feelstable and finally understand what was happening.” Now that this integration hastaken place, she describes her normal state as featuring a constant psychic andspiritual awareness:Once it stabilized I realized I was left with abilities that could help otherpeople. I started to get a sense of what the purpose of it was and what good itcould do for others. With enhanced sensory awareness I can read what’s going onwith people at the unconscious level, and help make those things conscious andhelp transform them. There’s an awareness of energy or vibration orconsciousness, an ability to read that fundamental level of reality, what’sgoing on beneath the surface. . . .There’s also a more expanded awareness and a realization of our context in theuniverse, an expanded understanding of the journey of the soul and thecontinuity of consciousness, an understanding that physical life is just onedimension of reality.I walk between two worlds a lot of the time. I’m learning to enjoy physicalreality and family life, and just the simple things in life. That’s becomeheightened — an appreciation of everyday life. I always had a sense of beautybut it’s become more heightened now. There’s certainly a connection with natureand because of the openings and awareness of energy and vibration, I cancertainly delight in nature and feel its forces and its cycles. When that firsthappened I thought I was losing the plot, when I thought I could almost feel atree speaking to me, but now I realize I was just picking up on the energy. . ..What was interesting was that I moved back down to Devon (my home town) and wasfully expecting to walk into the room and for family and friends not torecognize me. I felt so different, like a completely different person to behonest. All my internal frames of reference have changed. I no longer experiencelife as a random sequence of disconnected, separate events of which I am merelya passenger or victim. I experience life as an interconnected co-creativepartnership with some kind of intelligent force or ever-present sentiency. Ilive as a timeless soul enjoying my physical experience. That is my dailyreality.As another example, Simon experienced energetic awakening during a verystressful period in which he was forced to do a job that he intensely disliked,and while his wife was undergoing tests for cancer. He “literally did not sleepat all for a week due to worry and stress. . . . [Then] out of nowhere at 5 amone morning I had what I now realize was a sudden uncontrolled kundaliniawakening.” There were shooting pains and convulsions of energy going up anddown his spine, and he had the experience of regressing to previous lives, and“had the clearest understanding of God and the universe.”Even though Simon knew almost nothing about spirituality, he, like Kimberley,was sure he was undergoing some form of transformation. But there was no one togive him any guidance. He went to see a doctor, who transferred him to apsychiatric hospital where he was locked up and medicated. Initially he wentalong with the doctors’ diagnosis, believed that he had gone mad, and took allthe medication he was given. But after a few months, once his condition began tostabilize, his certainty that he had undergone some form of positivetransformation returned. He read the work of Eckhart Tolle and other authors(including Waking from Sleep, which was how he came to make contact with me),which helped him make sense of his new state of being. He began to attend aSahaja Yoga center and to realize that he had undergone a spiritual awakening.Simon described the changes his awakening brought to him as follows:I found I wasn’t able to work full-time anymore. I had to work part-time. I wasa service manager at BMW car dealers and I just couldn’t do it anymore,physically and mentally. I had a different perspective, a different outlook onlife. . . . Now I have lost all material desires. I used to think my life wouldonly be complete if I had a newer, faster motorbike and drove my wife mad foryears with impulsive purchases of dozens of different bikes. At the time of myoriginal breakdown I was consumed with having the latest biggest car andgadgets. This has all dissolved into thin air.It took several years for Simon to feel that his wakeful state had fully settledand integrated and that the disruptive effects of his sudden transformation hadfaded away completely. But finally he began to feel a powerful ongoing sense ofcontentment and fulfillment, one of the effects of which was a new enjoyment ofinactivity and solitude. He recognizes that this is one of the biggest changeshe has undergone: “Now I look forward to nothing better than sitting andmeditating in thoughtless awareness. . . . I don’t get bored anymore. I onlywork two days per week and all I do otherwise is read books, go for walks, andmeditate. In the past, I couldn’t sit still for five minutes. I had to be doingsomething or going somewhere. The transition from that to being able to sit anddo nothing is massive.”As a final example, Eric experienced an energetic awakening after a yogaretreat. He had suffered from serious psychiatric problems earlier in his life,and shortly after the retreat he experienced his “first manic episode for tenyears,” probably triggered by the intensive yoga practice. He had “severalexperiences where my consciousness seemed to rise suddenly, the energy meridiansin my body were energized, and my mind became sharper and clearer.” He was surehe was undergoing a spiritual transformation but was admitted to a psychiatricward where the staff was skeptical and hostile. However, he managed to persuadethem to discharge him after a few days, and on the same day he had a“breakthrough” experience: “My mind was becoming quieter, and at the same timethe world was becoming sharper, more real, and the experience was lasting. Iwent for a swim while my friend taught a class at the gym, and for the firsttime in my life I experienced myself as consciousness. I went home that nightstill feeling very clear, and my mind was still quiet.”This was followed a few weeks later by another shift in consciousness, which ledto a stable, ongoing state of wakefulness. This occurred while he was having ashower one morning:I was in a vibrant dimension of clarity, laughing my head off, absolutelyelated. I realized a profound truth, what it meant just to be alive and to beable to have a shower, and have a bed to sleep in, and food to eat. . . . I wasamazed at the quality of the colour of the sky, it had never looked like thatbefore, and the warmth on my skin, it was like the world had been made anew.I felt like a new person. The things that used to bother me didn’t anymore. Ispend a lot of time in the present now, more than I ever did, and I can quiet mymind easily when I want to. My family has often remarked on my positive changes,and my psychiatrist told me recently that I’m one of the most psychologicallyhealthy people she’s ever met.Life is simple. And life is precious. All forms of life are sacred. Life is amiracle, and it’s to be enjoyed. Every moment is different; every moment isalive with possibilities. If I was to lose everything tomorrow, I’d be okay. Thegreatest way I can use my life is to contribute toward the well-being of allforms of life. . . . I spend most of my time in the moment, and in many waysencourage others to do the same. There’s nothing lacking from my presentsituation. I don’t feel uneasy when I’m lacking direction or stuck. All of thedifficult things in my life happened to get me to where I am today — and I’mvery happy with who I am and where I am — so I no longer label experiences asgood or bad.IntegrationAlthough all sudden awakenings are often disruptive and can take a long time tofully integrate, this seems to be particularly true of energetic awakenings.(Kimberley said it took her two to three years, while Simon said it took severalyears.) Because energetic awakenings are so powerful and explosive, they areespecially likely to cause psychological disturbances — and physical problems —that may take years to settle. As we can see in the examples above, people whoundergo energetic awakenings are likely to be diagnosed with psychiatricproblems. Spiritual awakening is certainly not a form of psychosis, butsometimes it may resemble it. It’s easy for psychiatrists who aren’t aware ofawakening as a phenomenon to misdiagnose it as psychosis and to prescribemedication or hospitalization.However, in all the cases of energetic awakening I investigated, thepsychological disturbances and physical difficulties eventually became lessintense or faded away all together, even if it took several years. This waspartly due to people’s increased understanding of their experience but alsobecause energetic awakenings seem to be a process that naturally plays itselfout, slowly settling over time like a very long, drawn-out earthquake.Again, it’s difficult to make a clear distinction between these energeticawakenings and the experiences of ego-dissolution we looked at in the previouschapter because the latter usually have an energetic aspect to them, too. Whenthe normal ego dissolves, the energy that it monopolized is freed up and flowsthrough our being. We feel intensely alive and our perceptions are energized sothat our surroundings appear intensely vivid and beautiful. But the experienceswe’ve looked at in this chapter seem to be different in the sense that they areso overtly and intensely energetic.However, the real difference between these two modes of sudden awakening may bethat the energy that they feature is of a different nature and has a differentsource.Sexual Awakening Experiences and Energetic AwakeningI’ve been referring to the experiences in this chapter as “kundalini-like”rather than kundalini experiences. This is because I don’t believe the conceptof kundalini awakening is literally true. I don’t believe that there really is amysterious energy source located at a chakra close to the bottom of the spine.My feeling is that what Yogic and Tantric traditions called kundalini energy isactually sexual energy, or libido (to use the Freudian term). In Daoist terms,this energy is xing. And I believe that this is the energy that flowsexplosively through people in these experiences, so forcefully that itdemolishes the normal self-system like a tidal wave.5 [part0027.html#rch8en5]Many researchers have identified a connection between energetic kundalini-likeawakening and sexuality. In studying reports of kundalini awakening,transpersonal psychotherapist Bonnie Greenwell found that the experience couldsometimes be triggered by powerful sexual encounters and that its aftereffectscan include spontaneous orgasms and heightened sexual desire in general.6[part0027.html#rch8en6] Some people also describe energetic awakenings as havinga sexual quality. Here, for example, is a report of a temporary awakeningexperience of a highly energetic nature, which I collected for my book Wakingfrom Sleep. This occurred after a long period of meditation, during which theperson felt a “forceful, pushing sensation near the base of my spine.” And asshe continued breathing:This sensation continued to rise in my spine, getting higher with eachin-breath. It was a magnificent but intensely intimate and sexual experience. Itwas at that point where the sensation was arriving at my neck that I panicked. Iknew that if I did not resume control, this force would pass through my head andout through the crown and as a result I would scream and be forced to run aroundthe room like some crazy person. . . . [For weeks afterward] my face shone witha new happiness and many people commented on the “new image” — lively, awake,and laughing. I had boundless energy and required little or no sleep. I wassurrounded by people wanting to talk to me.7 [part0027.html#rch8en7] [italicsmine]The connection between energetic awakening and sexuality is perhaps clearest inreports of sexual awakening experiences. These often involve an explosiverelease of energy shooting through one’s body and filling one’s being with heatand light. This is illustrated by the following intensely energetic experience,which was sent to me after I wrote a blog article on transcendent sexualexperiences:I was making love and suddenly the pleasure was all throughout my body, then Iwas nothing but the pleasure. I was no longer in my body in a physical sense, Iwas energy. My partner’s energy and mine merged together, and I saw that energywhile simultaneously being that energy. Then I began seeing a pattern, maybe anenergy pattern, maybe a light pattern, but nonetheless it was something I hadnever seen or heard of before in reality so I have nothing to compare it to.Then, I passed through “something,” into another universe, dimension, realm orwhatever, and became the pattern that I was seeing. I was no longer in the room,I wasn’t anywhere, I was in an all-encompassing void, only existing as theenergy or light pattern. Instinctively I knew, not believed, that this was whereI was before my first memories and first became conscious in human form.8[part0027.html#rch8en8]The transpersonal psychologist Jenny Wade collected ninety-one reports of sexualawakening experiences, many of which showed similarities to energetic awakening.As Wade describes it, “Some people report strange energies coursing through thebody. Sometimes it starts with a sense that the sexual charge normally rooted inthe genitals is spreading throughout the entire body, lighting it up withcrackling power and fireworks.”9 [part0027.html#rch8en9] One person spoke of an“electric charge,” while another person described an “electrical feeling thatmoves up my body and just goes out my eyes. When it’s intense, it’s almostblinding.”10 [part0027.html#rch8en10]Energetic awakening and sexual awakening experiences are connected, in my view,because they involve the same type of energy — sexual energy, libido, or xing.Energetic awakening experiences involve an explosive release of energy thatnormally expresses itself through sexual desires and impulses.Energy and DevelopmentIn order to understand this connection between awakening and sexual energy, weneed to consider how the distribution of the energy of our whole being changesas we develop from childhood to adulthood.Young children possess an abundance of free-flowing energy. In Yogicterminology, this can be described as pranotthana, a state of uplifted orintensified life-energy. Or as the transpersonal psychologist Michael Washburndescribes it, young children are “bathed in the water of life. Ripples and wavesof delicious energy move through the infant’s body, filling it with delight.When its needs are satisfied and it’s otherwise content, [it] experiences a seaof dynamic plenitude, blissful fullness.”11 [part0027.html#rch8en11] Because ofthis abundance of rich energy flowing through their being, young childrennaturally possess some of the characteristics of the wakeful state, such asintense perception, a sense of meaning or of an atmosphere of harmony, and asense of inner well-being, bliss, or joy. (We’ll discuss this more later.)But when the child reaches adulthood, this free-flowing energy begins to beconcentrated into two main areas: the ego and libido. The ego, as a part of theadult self-system, begins to use a large proportion of our life-energy. At thesame time, roughly in parallel with the ego, we begin to mature as sexualbeings. Our previously free-flowing energy becomes centered around sexualdesires. (As perception becomes automatized in order to conserve energy, adultslose the fresh and intense perceptual awareness of children.)So it may be that the phenomenon of energetic awakening occurs when thislibidinal energy is suddenly released from its sexual center and flows wildlythrough our whole being, so explosively that it dislodges and demolishes ournormal self-system. For some people this may simply lead to a breakdown or astate of psychosis, but for others it may allow a latent wakeful self-system toemerge.Sexual energy is extremely intense and concentrated, which is why its repressioncan have such harmful consequences (as Freud, Wilhelm Reich, and many otherpsychologists have pointed out). And whereas egoic energy is used continuously,sexual energy is often dormant, awaiting a stimulus to be aroused. This can makeits release even more explosive. Certainly sexual energy seems to have a morevolatile nature than egoic energy, which may be why energetic awakening is moredisruptive than awakening through ego-dissolution. Even when it flows freelythrough our whole being, the sexual energy may still retain some of its sexualquality, which explains why kundalini-like awakenings may sometimes have asexual element to them.image [../images/00006.jpeg]It does, therefore, seem to make sense to think in terms of two different modesof sudden spiritual awakening: one related to the ego, the other to the libido(or, if you prefer, one coming from above and the other from below). However, asI mentioned at the end of the previous chapter, I’m aware of the danger — andthe artificiality — of making distinctions in the misty, unmapped landscape ofwakefulness. I certainly don’t think that there are two cut-and-dried categoriesof sudden awakening, one ego based and one libido based. It may be that in somecases both modes occur together, indistinguishably. In other words, a person mayexperience ego-dissolution due to dissolution of psychological attachments, and,at the same time, the sheer stress and pressure of their predicament may triggeran explosive release of libidinal energy. (One possible example of this is JCMac, whose awakening was both an experience of ego-dissolution and an intenselyenergetic experience that took many years to settle and integrate.) It’sdifficult to differentiate them because loss and stress usually occursimultaneously.Also in the same way that ego-dissolution usually has an energetic aspect to it,energetic awakenings involve ego-dissolution. The only difference is thatenergetic awakenings dissolve the ego with the sheer force of their explosive,disruptive power rather than through a process of dissolving psychologicalattachments.But the end result is the same: the birth of a new self."},{"pageContent":"9. Other Types of Sudden Awakening: Is It Possible to Awaken throughPsychedelics or Technology? [part0005.html#rch9]Is psychological turmoil the only way that sudden awakening can occur? Accordingto my research, this varies in relation to the two different modes of awakeningwe looked at in the previous chapter. Awakenings through ego-dissolution almostalways occur in response to turmoil and loss. On the other hand, energeticawakenings can be triggered by a wide range of circumstances. Although theyappear to be most frequently by intense turmoil, they may occasionally betriggered by intensive meditation and yoga or even by psychedelic drugs.1[part0027.html#rch9en1]But can’t awakening just happen spontaneously, too, for no apparent reason?Isn’t it possible for us to experience a moment of sudden insight, seeing thingsas they really are, which permanently transforms us?Sudden Awakening in Traditional SpiritualitySome spiritual traditions suggest that spontaneous awakening is possible. As wesaw in chapter 5 [part0012.html#BE6O0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5], mostspiritual traditions see awakening as a gradual process generated by spiritualpractice or by following certain lifestyle guidelines (such as the BuddhistEightfold Path or the eight-limbed path of Yoga). However, some Buddhist schoolsdisagree with this. The Ch’an (Chinese Buddhist) and Zen traditions moved awayfrom the Buddha’s original gradualist model. More than anything else, theydisputed the view that human beings move slowly toward wakefulness throughlifetime after lifetime, until they finally have the capability to awaken withinone particular lifetime. They argue that awakening can occur suddenly in anylifetime. They don’t discount gradual awakening but believe that suddenawakening is also possible, and that it’s superior to the former. In Ch’an, inparticular, a great deal of conflict existed between the northern sudden schoolsand the southern gradualist schools.According to proponents of the sudden view, awakening occurs in a flash ofinsight, in which one sees the true nature of self and the world (the Zen termkensho literally means “seeing into one’s true nature”). Hui-Neng, the SixthPatriarch of Chinese Buddhism who lived during the seventh century CE, describessudden awakening as perceiving “the right view concerning defilement, delusionand sentient beings, resulting in instant enlightenment.”2[part0027.html#rch9en2] Once a person has experienced this moment ofrealization, they can never again fall into delusion.In some respects, however, this debate is based on a false premise. Even iffollowers of Zen and Ch’an view the actual moment of awakening as sudden, theystill recognize the importance of preparing the way for awakening, of undergoingtraining and discipline so that it’s more likely to occur. This preparation anddiscipline includes rigorous study, koans, and meditation. Hui-Neng states thatthe “right view” that brings about enlightenment is the result of “training themind.” Or as the Buddhist scholar D. T. Suzuki puts it, although awakening mayoccur in a sudden flash of insight, it’s the result of “much piling up ofmatters intellectual and demonstrative. The piling has reached a limit ofstability and the whole edifice has come tumbling to the ground, when, behold, anew heaven is open to full survey.”3 [part0027.html#rch9en3]In other words, even though awakening may seem to occur suddenly, the processitself is a gradual one. A great deal of inner change takes place to enabletransformation to occur, just as — to adapt another metaphor that Suzuki uses —a long process of cooling takes place to reach the point where water “suddenly”freezes. These changes may be so gradual that they are imperceptible or they maytake place unconsciously, below the surface. It’s only the final stage of theprocess — what appears to be the sudden moment of awakening — that is obvious orexperienced consciously.Sudden Awakening in Contemporary SpiritualitySome contemporary nonduality teachers take a similar approach to Zen and Ch’anbut go much further. They suggest that there’s nothing we can do to prepare forawakening, and we shouldn’t use spiritual practices and paths as a means toattain it. Awakening just happens for no particular reason; we can’t force it.According to this interpretation, spiritual practice is actuallycounterproductive because it implies that we’re working toward awakening as agoal. Making an effort to attain this goal strengthens the ego and so takes usfurther away from enlightenment. Awakening will come when we stop making aneffort — when we give up striving and let go of the idea that we’re a self thatneeds to be awakened. Then we realize that we were always awakened, thatwakefulness is our natural state, and it was only our clinging to the idea ofself that stopped us from realizing this.This argument seems logical, and there is a grain of truth in it, but I haven’tcome across any cases in which awakening has occurred in this way. In my view,this approach places too much emphasis on the Zen or Ch’an idea that awakeningis about realization, about “getting it” or seeing the truth of things. Thisinterpretation is a little problematic even in its original Buddhist context. Itsuggests that awakening arises solely from “right view” — when it’s probablymore accurate to see “right view” as a quality that arises with awakening. Whena person wakes up, they see the world in a different way, with a revelatorysense of understanding and knowledge. But awakening is the condition of thisrealization rather than the other way around. Awakening is primarily anexperience — a new sense of connection or oneness, a new perception of thephenomenal world and a new sense of identity. The understanding or insightfollows from this experience.Nevertheless, it’s perfectly possible to imagine this “right view” emerging asan aspect of wakefulness, following a long period of spiritual training, asrecommended by Zen and Ch’an teachers (and then perhaps being misinterpreted itas the cause of the awakening rather than just an aspect of it). It’s moredifficult to imagine how this revelation could occur for no reason, without along preparation of spiritual practice. Since the revelation occurs as an aspectof awakening, the process of awakening already has to be under way for it toarise.Through long-term spiritual development, changes quietly take place within thepsyche at an unconscious level. And my feeling is that when sudden realizationseems to occur for no reason — apart from simply “letting go of the spiritualsearch” — this is what has been happening. For example, Tony Parsons, one of themost radical nonduality teachers, spent many years investigating differenttherapies, practices, and religions to no evident benefit. Then, one day whilehe was walking across a park, he experienced a flash of insight that apparentlycame unbidden. As he describes it:I noticed as I walked that my mind was totally occupied with expectations aboutfuture events that might or might not happen. I seemed to choose to let go ofthese projections and simply be with my walking. I noticed that each footstepwas totally unique in feel and pressure, and that it was there one moment andgone the next, never to be repeated in the same way again.As all of this was happening there was a transition from me watching my walkingto simply the presence of walking. What happened then is simply beyonddescription. I can only inadequately say in words that total stillness andpresence seemed to descend over everything. All and everything became timelessand I no longer existed. I vanished and there was no longer an experiencer. . ..I felt I had been suddenly overtaken and everything took on a new sense. Ilooked at grass, trees, dogs and people, moving as before, but now I not onlyrecognized their essence but I was their essence, as they were mine. It was inanother way as if everything, including me, was enveloped in a deep andall-encompassing love, and in a strange way it seemed that what I saw was alsosomehow nothing special. . . it is the norm that is not usually perceived.4[part0027.html#rch9en4]This is a beautiful description of a powerful awakening experience, but althoughTony writes that “this illumination had occurred without any effort on mypart,”5 [part0027.html#rch9en5] it’s highly likely that his previous years ofexploration, spiritual practice, and therapy helped prepare the way — or createthe necessary conditions — for this shift, in the same way that Zen and Ch’anpractices were designed to cultivate the conditions that allow flashes ofawakening to occur. It’s probably impossible to spend years investigatingspiritual practices and therapies without gaining some degree of positivedevelopment, even if this only means heightened powers of introspection andself-observation.Tony’s shift is similar to Russel Williams’s experience of waking up one morningand realizing that he was one with the horses he was looking after and witheverything else. But Russel was clearly aware — at least in retrospect — thatthe three years he spent looking after the horses was a form of spiritualpractice that created the conditions for his awakening to occur.Actively seeking spiritual development — or awakening itself — can beproblematic. It depends on the nature of one’s seeking. In some cases, it may bea rigid egoic process in which a person sets their sights on the goal ofawakening much as they would on a goal of becoming rich or successful. Orseeking may be a diversionary tactic in which a person explores spiritualpractices and sets their sights on awakening as a way of escaping fromdifficulties in their life or psychological issues. In these cases, seekingcertainly can be counterproductive and can take us further away from harmony andwell-being.However, spiritual seeking can be — and most frequently is, in my experience ofseekers — more organic, generating not from the ego but from the core of ourbeing. Ideally, seeking stems from an impulse to expand ourselves, to transcendour psychological discord and our narrow egoic desires and engender a moreintegrated and connected identity — that is, an impulse to wake up.Fundamentally this impulse is an evolutionary one. Ever since the beginnings oflife on earth there has been movement toward the expansion and intensificationof consciousness, and the impulse for spiritual growth is part of this. It’s anexpression — in us as individuals — of the same impulse that has given rise toever more complex and conscious life-forms over countless millions of years.Ideally, spiritual seekers act on behalf of evolution, allowing this impulse toexpress itself through them. They may not even have a clear idea of where thisimpulse is leading them; they may not even be conscious of spiritual awakeningas a goal. They may not necessarily strive to become awakened but simply allowtheir impulse for growth to express itself and follow where it takes them. Theyuse spiritual practices — unconsciously or consciously — as technologies oftranscendence, methods of facilitating an impulse for growth and transformationthat is much larger and older than they are.Awakening through Psychedelics?In the 1960s, psychedelic pioneers such as Timothy Leary popularized the beliefthat drugs such as LSD could provide chemical enlightenment, a way ofcircumventing the years of arduous spiritual practice that monks and otherspiritual seekers put themselves through to attain wakefulness. Why spend yearsmeditating and practicing self-denial when you can simply alter your brainchemistry directly by taking psychedelics?It soon became apparent that this was naive and that regular LSD use was muchmore likely to generate psychological breakdown than spiritual awakening. Manyof those who originally used LSD as a way of expanding consciousness — includingTimothy Leary himself — eventually began to use drugs hedonistically, as a wayof escaping boredom and discord after their chemical enlightenment project hadfailed.Nowadays, psychoactive substances such as ayahuasca and DMT (N,N-Dimethyltryptamine) are widely used with a spiritual intention, as a means ofself-exploration and self-expansion. Ayahuasca in particular has the status ofan elixir of enlightenment, as LSD had in the 1960s.As I suggest in Waking from Sleep, psychedelics can certainly generate temporaryawakening experiences. Some writers on mysticism — usually with religiousbackgrounds — have argued that psychedelic awakening experiences are facsimilesof genuine ones, similar to them but devoid of any real spiritual quality.6[part0027.html#rch9en6] But this is difficult to justify because psychedelicawakening experiences clearly feature many of the same characteristics of otherawakening experiences, such as intensified perception and a sense of harmony,meaning, and connection or oneness with the world.Nevertheless, there are differences between psychedelic awakening experiencesand other types. In awakening experiences generated by an intensification andstilling of life-energy (such as through meditation or contact with nature), weoften have a sense of energetic serenity, as if we’ve made contact with a deepenergy of being that has a natural blissful quality. Related to this, we oftensense the onset of a deeper identity, a new self that is somehow more authenticthan our normal self. Psychedelic experiences tend not to feature these inneraspects. They are mainly perceptual and visionary experiences rather than inwardexperiences of peace and wholeness. In fact, this applies to all awakeningexperiences caused by homeostasis disruption, that is, the intense disruption ofour normal physiological and neurological functioning through practices such asfasting, sleep deprivation, self-inflicted pain, unusual breathing patterns,exposure to extreme temperatures, and so on. Drug-induced awakening experiencesare simply a variety of these.Psychedelics can bring temporary awakening experiences but it’s very unlikelythat they can lead to permanent awakening, either gradually or suddenly.(Equally, one could say that it’s doubtful that other methods of homeostasisdisruption such as fasting or sleep deprivation can lead to permanentwakefulness.) Psychedelics (like all other homeostasis disruptors) are basicallydissolutive; that is, they dissolve the normal self-system and put itspsychological mechanisms out of action. When the normal self-system dissolves,the desensitizing mechanism no longer functions so that our perceptions becomeintensely vivid. The boundaries of the normal self-system fade away so that weno longer experience separateness. Our normal concepts of ourselves and realityalso fade away so that we feel we’re looking at the world and ourselves in acompletely new way. In addition, with the boundaries of the self dissolved, agreat deal of unconscious mental phenomena may emerge. This dissolution issufficient for temporary awakening experiences, but permanent wakefulness canonly occur if there’s a new self-system to replace the normal one. It’s notenough to dissolve the sense of self — a new self has to replace it.As we saw in chapter 7 [part0014.html#DB7S0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5],for people who have been through long periods of intense turmoil and trauma,this new self-system may be ready to emerge. As their psychological attachmentsprogressively dissolve away, the new self-system slowly prepares itself tosupplant it, slowly taking form in the same way that a butterfly prepares itselfto emerge from its chrysalis. But it’s unlikely that a new self is ready toemerge inside people who take psychedelics in normal situations. Theirself-systems will simply dissolve away temporarily and then their normalself-systems will simply reform and reestablish themselves.This explains why psychedelics (including ayahuasca) can’t generate gradualawakening either. If you regularly ingest psychedelics, you may experienceregular awakening experiences, but it’s highly unlikely that a higher self willslowly emerge or form. Prolonged spiritual practice will gradually form a newself that slowly supplants your old self; spiritual practice slowly facilitatesthe creation of a mold of a new self that already exists as a potential. Butingesting psychedelics doesn’t entail any training or discipline in itself.You could say that spiritual practice is basically constructive — it graduallychanges the structures of consciousness, remolding your self-system into ahigher functioning form. But because psychedelics are basically dissolutive (ordestructive), they don’t facilitate the emergence of a new self-system. Thedanger with regular use of psychedelics is that the structures of the normalself-system will completely dissolve away and, without another self-system tosupplant it, there will simply be a psychic vacuum that equates to a state ofpsychosis. Unfortunately, cases of this are not uncommon. In fact, psychosis,not awakening, is really the only permanent psychological change caused byregular use of psychedelics.In every area of human experience, readiness is important. If you haven’tattained a sufficient level of development (including sufficient understanding)to process and integrate an experience, it may be overwhelming and damaging.This is a particular problem with psychedelic experiences because they can be sopowerful. Just one powerful psychedelic experience can permanently damage aperson whose self-system is fragile and delicate. As the ancient Neoplatonistphilosopher Iamblichus warns, not all experiences of ecstasy are elevating andtransformational. They may have the opposite effect. Unless a person’s innerbeing is properly prepared, ecstasy can make “the soul degenerate, confused, andeven more alienated from reality.”7 [part0027.html#rch9en7] And this cancertainly happen with the ecstasy of psychedelics.However, psychedelics can sometimes be a contributory factor in awakening, bothgradual and sudden. They may contribute to gradual awakening if a person takesthem at the same time as following a program of spiritual practice. In thatcase, the stability and integration provided by spiritual practice may minimizethe disruptive potential of psychedelics and make positive effects more likely.(At the same time, though, I feel that if a person’s practice is effective, it’sunlikely that they will feel the need or impulse to take psychedelics.)In terms of sudden awakening, psychedelics can be a contributory factor bycreating a psychic opening that unlocks the transformational potential ofturmoil or trauma in a way similar to therapy. As Stanislav Grof suggests,psychedelic substances may be the final trigger of spiritual emergencies (orpsychospiritual crises, as he also terms them), following a long period of loss,failure, or traumatic emotional experiences.8 [part0027.html#rch9en8]In my research, I came across one case of sudden energetic awakening that wastriggered by psychedelics. Helen took a small amount of ecstasy during a longperiod of depression and intense stress. Immediately before her transformationalexperience, a relationship with a close friend had broken down. After taking theecstasy she suddenly “felt a rush of love, like I was burning up. My whole bodywas flooded with light.” This was a transformational experience, which remainedeven after the effects of the ecstasy had faded away. There was a sudden anddramatic opening of her psyche, which took her many years to integrate. As shedescribed it:After that my whole senses opened up, and I found everything overwhelming. I wascompletely blown open too fast. I had no filter. I was so open and so delicate.Whenever I went out it was very chaotic. I was having psychic episodes but Ididn’t understand them. I could sense other people’s thoughts.I thought I was going bonkers, but I was aware that I was going bonkers, and Ihad a sense that I needed to work through it, that it would play itself out. Itlasted for about two years, before it started to stabilize. I was working in abookshop at the time but had to stop because I was ill. I was diagnosed with ME[myalgic encephalopathy, or chronic fatigue syndrome]. I was too ill to go out.The past seven years have been about integrating the old and the new. Over thelast three or four years I’ve reached a more stable state. I’ve worked throughthe chaos and I don’t feel vulnerable anymore. I feel a lot more peaceful andstable now.I feel like a completely different person. I used to be very cynical andintolerant and judgmental. I was also anxious and neurotic and insecure. I’m alot more intuitive and in touch with myself, a lot more aware of my ownenergies. People are so surprised at how sorted I seem. People who knew me inthe past can’t believe that I’m the same person, they’re amazed at how calm andcentred I am. Now I’m really happy being me. I used to feel a general anxietyall the time.Ecstasy appears to have been the catalyst for this experience, but it certainlywasn’t the sole cause of it. And in my view, this is true of psychedelics ingeneral — they can possibly have a catalytic but not a direct causal effect interms of awakening.The Primary and Secondary ShiftsNevertheless, there is a way in which psychedelics can be transformative, evenby themselves. There’s an important distinction between what I call the primaryshift and the secondary shift. The primary shift is the transformation we’vebeen speaking about throughout this book — the shift into a state of wakefulnessin which the normal self-system is supplanted by the higher-functioning wakefulself-system so that a person has a new sense of identity. The secondary shift isa less fundamental kind of transformation. A person doesn’t experience a shiftin identity — or a state of oneness with the world or heightened awareness — buttheir values, beliefs, and attitudes are transformed. They have a newperspective; they look at life in a different way. For example, they might startto believe in life after death, become less materialistic and more altruistic,and become more optimistic and more trusting toward other people. They may beginto investigate spiritual teachings with a sense that there’s much more to lifethan they previously realized, that the world isn’t the same place it was beforeand their previous lifestyle no longer seems meaningful.You could compare the distinction between the primary and secondary shifts toinhabiting a house. The primary shift — actual awakening — is like moving into adifferent house or, perhaps more strictly, creating a new house on the same plotof land where your previous one stood. A secondary shift is like remaining inthe same house but giving it a complete overhaul, renovating and redecoratingit. In a secondary shift, your previous self-system and sense of identity remainintact. Since your ego-boundaries remain essentially intact, you don’texperience the intense connection, oneness, or intensified perception of thewakeful state. You feel that you are the same continuous ego-self as before,although you may possess a different cognitive map of reality.9[part0027.html#rch9en9]John is a good example of this secondary shift. He had a successful career as acomputer programmer and described himself as very materialistically oriented: “Iwas motivated by the money, the possessions, and the status that came along with‘success.’ I was very anti-religious and I had donated money to the NationalSecular Society to support their work. My car was a very expensive ‘look at me’sports car.” Although he had experiences of lucid dreaming he was “not veryinterested in anything remotely spiritual.”However, John decided to attend a lucid dreaming workshop, where there was anoption to take ayahuasca. As a result of his ayahuasca experience, his vision ofreality and his values were transformed. After believing that he “knew it all,”he became aware of how limited his normal perspective was. As he described it:I saw that the seemingly endless desire for more money, things, and success wasnot the key to happiness. My motivation changed to “give something back” to theworld that had been so good to me. I retrained as a counsellor and worked as avolunteer with cancer patients at my local hospital. I became interested in“spirituality” and the underlying message of religion, and I donated money tothe Lucidity Institute to support their work. My car is now an ordinary and verypractical seven-seater. These changes have proved to be long term and the dateof the experience, the 28th of January 2005, is as important to me as mybirthday.Indeed, a great deal of research shows that psychedelics can bring about along-lasting shift in perspective and values. As Aldous Huxley famously writesof psychedelic awakening experiences in The Doors of Perception, “The man whocomes back through the Door in the Wall will never be quite the same as the manwho went out.”10 [part0027.html#rch9en10] This was illustrated by the theologianWalter Pahnke’s famous “Good Friday Experiment” in 1962, in which a group oftheology students were given doses of psilocybin (the active ingredient in“magic” mushrooms) in a religious setting. They all had powerful mysticalexperiences, including feelings of ecstasy, awe, and oneness. In a follow-upstudy six months later, eight of ten students said that the experience had had apowerful long-term effect, deepening their sense of spirituality and enrichingtheir lives. And remarkably, this was still the case twenty-five years later. Ina follow-up study by the psychedelic researcher Rick Doblin in 1987, most of theoriginal participants reflected that the experience had changed thempermanently, giving them a deeper appreciation of life and nature, an increasedsense of joy, a reduced fear of death, and greater empathy for minorities andoppressed people.11 [part0027.html#rch9en11]There have been similar findings in relation to ayahuasca. The author andproponent of psychedelics Dennis McKenna found that use of the plant “may resultin profound, lasting, and positive behavioral and lifestyle changes.”12[part0027.html#rch9en12] He gives the example of an ayahuasca group whosemembers had a history of addiction and domestic violence. These negative traitsfell away with the use of ayahuasca. This recalls the findings of psychedelictherapy programs in the early 1960s, when alcoholics were given LSD. Around ahalf of them responded positively to the treatment and either became long-termsober or began to drink much less.13 [part0027.html#rch9en13]This research makes it clear that psychedelics can have a powerfultransformative effect, although not in the sense of generating full-fledgedwakefulness. Nevertheless, the secondary shift generated by psychedelics mayindirectly lead to a primary shift in the sense that it may encourage a personto follow spiritual practices or paths — or to generally live a lifestyle thatis more conducive to wakefulness — in an attempt to recapture their experience.Like awakening experiences in general, psychedelic experiences can provide aglimpse into a new, unsuspected dimension of harmony and meaning, and ideallygenerate an impulse to return to that dimension on a permanent, stable basis.One of the best examples of this is Ram Dass, formerly a psychology professor atHarvard University (under his birth name, Richard Alpert) and one of thepioneers of research into psychedelics. His experiences with LSD encouraged himto investigate meditation and yoga and to travel to India to study withspiritual teachers. He began a long journey of spiritual awakening that has ledhim to become one of the most revered spiritual authors and teachers of ourtime.The important thing to realize is that psychedelics are not a permanent means ofproviding us with what they offer us temporarily. In a sense, they aredeceptive. They show us the place where we should be heading, but they don’tprovide us with the means of getting there. They show us the destination but notthe route. If you try to use them as a route to awakening, you’re more likely toend up in a state of psychosis rather than wakefulness.Ideally, psychedelics can be wise guides, especially at the beginning of thespiritual journey. But once they have shared their wisdom with us, we shouldmove on and try to apply the knowledge we’ve gained. Or as philosopher AlanWatts puts it more succinctly, “Once you get the message, hang up.”Technological Wakefulness: The Fallacy of the Materialist Model of MindThe only perspective from which chemical enlightenment really makes sense is ifwakefulness is seen as a neurological state; that is, if it’s explained as beinggenerated by a particular type of brain functioning, such as the activity ofcertain neurotransmitters or other chemicals, or enhanced or decreased activityin certain areas of the brain. If wakefulness is just a brain-state, then itshould be possible to produce this brain-state through chemical interventions.From this point of view, it might also be possible to generate wakefulness bytechnological means. Perhaps we could use machines to alter brain functioning orstimulate different parts of the brain and so create the neurological conditionsthat produce the wakeful state. Perhaps we could even use neurosurgery in thisway, too. If we know that wakefulness is associated with increased activity in acertain part of the brain, perhaps surgery can alter our neurologicalfunctioning so that these parts become more active. Or if we know thatwakefulness is associated with higher levels of certain chemicals (such as DMT),then perhaps we can tweak the brain’s functioning so that it produces higherlevels of these chemicals.This sounds absurd, of course — but then, for me, it’s absurd to think ofwakefulness as a neurological state. Of course, many people do assume thatmental activity is produced by neurological activity or, from a slightlydifferent perspective, that consciousness is produced by the brain. This is thestandard materialist model of the mind, closely related to the biologicalapproach to psychology, which sees psychiatric problems (such as depression orADHD) as produced by imbalances or dysfunctions in brain activity. This modelassumes that matter — physical “stuff” such as atoms, molecules, and cells — isthe only reality, and that what appears to us as “mind” or “consciousness” is anepiphenomenon produced by the activity of the molecules and cells in our brains.And so all of the different psychological states we experience such asdepression, joy, love, and wakefulness are the result of different variations ofactivity among these molecules and cells.This isn’t the place for a full discussion of the shortcomings of this model —philosophers such as David Chalmers and Thomas Nagel have written powerful textsexposing its flaws and inconsistencies.14 [part0027.html#rch9en14] But it’sstrange to think that, twenty years or so ago, when scientists began toinvestigate consciousness intensively, most were confident that it wouldn’t belong before we solved the mystery of how the brain gives rise to consciousexperience. They believed that brain-scanning technologies would enable us tosee how the brain’s billions of neurons work together to generate our subjectiveexperience. But despite more than two decades of intensive research andtheorizing, very little (if any) progress has been made. The so-called hardproblem (in the phrase coined by David Chalmers) of how the brain might giverise to the richness of our subjective experience seems to become ever moreintractable. No neuroscientist has ever made any reasonable suggestion about howthe brain might produce consciousness or even about which parts of the brainmight be involved in producing it. Phenomena such as near-death experiences(when the subjective experience seems to continue when the brain is clinicallydead) and terminal lucidity (when people with severe brain damage experience areturn to normal consciousness shortly before death) also argue against astraightforward link between the brain and consciousness. In addition, theredoesn’t seem to be an exact or reliable correspondence between mental states andneurological activity, which we would expect if the latter produced the former.For example, more and more research suggests no clear relationship betweenbrain-states and psychological conditions such as depression or ADHD, and noreal benefit of drugs designed to increase the brain’s serotonin uptake (or tochange the activity of the neurotransmitters supposedly associated with ADHD).15[part0027.html#rch9en15]There’s a growing sense that the materialist model of the mind is far toosimplistic. Philosophers are taking seriously the alternative panpsychist model,which holds that consciousness is a primary quality of the universe. In thismodel, consciousness is a fundamental force embedded into the fabric of realityso that it pervades everything — and even seemingly inanimate things areconscious (or at least possess a kind of protoconsciousness). This viewobviously fits well with high-intensity awakening experiences in which oneperceives a radiant spirit-force pervading all things and bringing all thingsinto oneness as manifestations of the force. (It also fits well with theworldview of many of the world’s indigenous peoples that the whole world ispervaded by a spirit-force.)This doesn’t mean that the brain isn’t necessary for consciousness. The functionof the brain may be to pick up and “canalize” an all-pervading consciousness sothat we can become individually conscious. Consciousness then becomes localizedwithin us, in a particular point in time and space. This applies to other livingbeings as well, even if they only possess consciousness in the sense of beingaware of their surroundings to some degree. Even if they don’t have brains ornervous systems, the function of their cells may be to pick up and canalizeconsciousness so that they become individual entities with some awareness oftheir surroundings. As living beings become more complex, with larger numbers ofcells interacting with each other in more complex ways, they are able to receiveand canalize consciousness more fully so that their own consciousness becomesmore intense and at the same time more subtle and intricate.This also doesn’t mean that the state of wakefulness — or any otherpsychological state such as depression or ADHD — isn’t related to neurologicalfunctioning. Perhaps the wakeful state is associated with higher or lower levelsof activity in certain parts of the brain. But there is no need to assume thatthe brain activity generates the state of wakefulness. We could just as easilyreverse the causal direction and suggest that the wakeful state generates theneurological state. This actually makes sense in terms of the panpsychist model,which suggests that mind is more fundamental than matter.In my view, therefore, the idea that you can chemically engineer a state ofwakefulness through technology or drugs — and the idea that wakefulness isfundamentally a neurological state — is as false as the idea that depression iscaused by a chemical imbalance that can be cured by drugs."},{"pageContent":"10. The Aftermath of Awakening: Spiritual Crisis [part0005.html#rch10]When we undergo awakening, doesn’t it mean that all our problems are at an end?Doesn’t wakefulness mean that finally we’re at peace, in a state where there’sno more striving, discord, or anxiety? Surely, if wakefulness means anything, itmeans a state of permanent ease and bliss. After all, aren’t all our problemscreated by the ego so that when the ego dissolves away, all our problemsdissolve away, too? The Upanishads state, “When [the soul] discovers the Atman,full of dignity and power, it is freed from suffering” and “when a man knows theinfinite, he is free; his sorrows have an end.”1 [part0027.html#rch10en1]I’d never wish to disagree with the sages of the Upanishads (it’s my favoritespiritual text, after all). But the sages were speaking generally andpoetically, without dealing with the intricacies of the awakening process. Theywere also part of a culture much more accepting and understanding ofwakefulness. Certainly for modern Westerners (such as Europeans or Americans),awakening can involve challenges and difficulties. When it occurs gradually —usually through following spiritual practices or paths — it often is smooth andeasy. Sudden awakening can also be smooth and easy, especially if the person hassome knowledge of spiritual practices and traditions to help them make sense ofwhat’s happening and a supportive environment around them. (Perhaps it alsodepends on how well established their new self-system is as a structure and howprepared it is for emergence.) But in most cases, when awakening occurssuddenly, it’s problematic to some degree. As the twentieth-century Christianmystic Bernadette Roberts describes it, the wakeful state is “a new dimension ofknowing and being that entails a difficult and prolonged readjustment.”2[part0027.html#rch10en2]In this chapter, we’re going to summarize these potential difficulties, focusingon three main areas: confusion, psychological disturbances, and physicalproblems. It’s important to remember that the difficulties related to theprocess of awakening tend to fade away, as we saw in relation to kundalini-likeenergetic awakenings. The birth of a new self can be painful and dangerous, buteventually the difficulties pass and the new self settles into its new state.But even then, wakefulness as a settled, ongoing state may not be completelyblissful and easy. Old behavior patterns may take some time to die away (or maynot die away at all), and life may still throw up challenges that destabilizeus. Certainly we’ll have a much deeper and steadier sense of well-being thanbefore. We’ll be much less affected by negative or stressful events, just aswe’ll be much less selfish and more altruistic than before. But this doesn’tmean that our lives will be completely trouble-free and that we’ll be completelyperfect as individuals.ConfusionGradual awakening provides ample opportunity for people to build a framework tomake sense of their experience. There’s time for people to gain knowledge andsupport — perhaps to gravitate to spiritual groups, explore spiritual practicesand traditions, read books, and meet other people who have had similarexperiences. But sudden awakening provides little or no opportunity to do this.Unless a person already has some knowledge of spiritual traditions, they willlikely be confused by their new state, possibly even to the extent of thinkingthat they’ve gone mad.It might seem strange to stress the importance of a conceptual understanding ofwakefulness because it’s fundamentally an experiential state, and in some sensesconceptual understanding can be an obstacle to it. Aren’t concepts what we’retrying to transcend? Don’t they stop us from seeing the world in its is-ness?Don’t they mean that we’ve become caught up in the intellect, with ideas andbeliefs?This is true, but a basic conceptual understanding of wakefulness is essential.A map is important so long as we just use it as a way of orienting ourselves, ofchecking that we know where we are and that we’re heading in the rightdirection. The map only becomes a problem when we spend all our time looking atit, thinking about where we’ve been and where we’re heading instead ofexperiencing the reality we’re in at this moment. If awakened individuals don’tunderstand the process they’re going through (or have been through), theirwakefulness will be overlaid with doubt, and they may even try to suppress it.Again, you might think, how is it possible to suppress a process as powerful asawakening? And how is it possible for such a powerfully positive experience tobe negated by confusion? But this is probably another example of idealizingwakefulness. I’ve come across countless cases where lack of a conceptualframework has caused difficulties. We’ve already seen that this confusion can bea problem with natural wakefulness, too. It was certainly a problem for me andfor Peace Pilgrim because we didn’t have the background knowledge to make senseof our state, and the wakeful perspective is so opposed to the values of thecultures we grew up in.Confusion caused difficulties even for Russel Williams, who is one of the mostintensely awakened individuals I’ve come across. I described in chapters 6[part0013.html#CCNA0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5] and 7[part0014.html#DB7S0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5] how Russel experiencedawakening after an early life of great turmoil and trauma and following threeyears of “accidental” spiritual practice while he was looking after horses as amember of a traveling circus. But there’s an interesting postscript to Russel’sstory. His sudden awakening occurred in 1950, when he was twenty-nine years old,at a time when there was little knowledge of spiritual traditions in Europe.After an initial honeymoon period, he began to doubt his newly awakened statebecause of the confusion he encountered whenever he tried to explain it topeople. As he traveled around with the circus, he sought out local vicars andclergymen, hoping that they would understand. As he describes it in Not I, NotOther Than I:I told them I only saw wholeness, with no separation, this natural state ofbeing which was nurturing and kindness. I thought it would interest them, butthey didn’t understand. They thought it was far-fetched, or that I was beingblasphemous. . . .The lack of understanding from others had the effect of making me very confused.I had a lot of knowledge but I couldn’t communicate it to anybody. I began todoubt myself. I thought, “If nobody can appreciate this, I must be mad. I’m sodifferent to everybody else.” I knew deep down that I wasn’t mad, that I hadsomething that was profoundly important to other people, but it was overlaidwith this confusion.3 [part0027.html#rch10en3]The frustration became so intense that one night, in desperation, Russel criedout, “For God’s sake, somebody help me!” Right at that moment, he felt a“massive flood of peace, a vast emptiness full of love. There was no substance.It was the same serene feeling I’d had before with the horses, but in greaterdepth. It was as if someone had dropped a soft warm blanket over me.”4[part0027.html#rch10en4] Just a few days later, he felt impelled to go to a talkabout spiritual healing in London, and there he met John Garrie, one of thefounders of one of the first Buddhist groups in England. As Russel describes it:He was the first person I ever met who could understand me. I could explain theway I experienced the world and he could relate it to the teachings of Buddhism.I felt a deep rapport with him. . . . It was a massive relief, to find out thatI wasn’t mad after all. I found out later that he’d been drawn to that meetingin a similar convoluted way to me. He had felt impelled to go too, even thoughhe wasn’t keen.5 [part0027.html#rch10en5]This gave Russel the confirmation he needed — or, more strictly speaking, theunderstanding and the support he needed — and from that point on he had a strongsense of orientation and purpose. Soon afterward he began to take on a role as aspiritual teacher, which has continued for over fifty years.William Murtha, whose awakening I described in Out of the Darkness, is anexample of a person who attempted to suppress his wakefulness because hecouldn’t make sense of it. William almost drowned after being swept into the seaby a freak wave. He had a near-death experience in which he floated outside hisbody and encountered beings who answered every question he had ever had aboutlife. But the experience — and the insights he learned — didn’t fit into thematerialistic model of reality he had always accepted. He couldn’t make sense ofwhat had happened and didn’t know how to explain it to other people, and soacted as if nothing had changed. For eighteen months he suppressed hiswakefulness. He tried to carry on living the way he had before — in fact, heclung even harder to his previous habits and values, working even harder anddrinking even more than before. But finally, and inevitability, the new selfthat he had been trying so hard to suppress burst through his resistance:All of a sudden I heard this little voice at the back of my head, saying, “Bill,this is not who you are, you are not meant to be here.” And I can just rememberstopping in my tracks and I sobered up, just like that. All of a sudden I justgot it. Everything became crystal clear. I just thought: What am I doing? I amrunning away from the truth of what happened to me. . . . I was running awayfrom it because of my narrow worldview, my conditioning, what I’d learned atschool. . . . It was like a switch going on. I could feel a shift inside me.6[part0027.html#rch10en6]Most shifters I interviewed described similar difficulties to Russel andWilliam. Many shifters described how the positive aspects of their new state ofbeing were offset by incomprehension and confusion. As one person put it, “Ididn’t understand at all what was going on. I had no concepts to help meunderstand it. Something was happening which felt very strong spiritually but Ididn’t know what was going to happen at the end of it.” Another person describedhow she “needed to do a lot of work and seeking to integrate and figure out howto live with this new person I was. I was very confused.” More graphically,another person described how his transformation “opened up a can of wormsbecause I had to find out what I had experienced and nobody I knew had theslightest clue what I was talking about.”As with Russel, shifters’ initial confusion is often intensified by theincomprehension they receive from others. In some cases, their own confusion maywholly be the result of the incomprehension of others. They may try to explainthe way they see the world now, only for people to shake their heads and saysomething like, “Wow — have you been taking drugs?” So many people might tellshifters that they “sound mad” that they may start to believe it themselves. Onewoman told me how she had a sudden spiritual awakening one morning in which itwas “as if I was seeing it for the first time. Everything shone with beauty andclarity no matter what it was. It was as if I had a new pair of eyes and therewas a light that was exquisite.” At the same time she had no idea what hadhappened to her and tried to explain it to other people in the hope of someguidance. “I asked everyone that I thought would understand if they couldexplain this. No one knew what to say.”In the worst-case scenario, wakefulness may be so catastrophically misunderstoodthat it becomes pathologized, seen as a mental illness rather than as ahigher-functioning state. A shifter who doesn’t understand their new state maygo to see a psychiatrist who knows nothing about spiritual awakening and onlysees signs of mental abnormality. The psychiatrist may prescribe drugs, whichwill suppress the awakening process, or even send the awakening person to apsychiatric hospital.In retrospect, many shifters were aware that the main source of their confusionwas their lack of knowledge of spirituality, which meant that they had noframework to make sense of their experiences. As one person told me, “I hadnever read a spiritual book or meditated, never done any spiritual practice, soI had no framework or reference point at all. It was all new. I documented asmuch as I could but there was so much happening so quickly.” And indeed, as I’vealready mentioned, I found that sudden awakening was less likely to beproblematic for individuals who already had some knowledge of spiritualtraditions and concepts. (Perhaps this was also because they already had contactwith spiritually minded people or groups who could provide them with someunderstanding, guidance, and support.) This also suggests that sudden awakeningis less likely to be problematic in cultures that are more accepting ofspirituality or where spiritual ideas and practices are a part of everyday life.(As I suggest in chapter 8[part0015.html#E9OE0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5], this is perhaps why theancient Yogic and Tantric texts devote little attention to the potentiallyproblematic aspects of kundalini awakening.)This period of confusion is only temporary. Almost everyone who undergoes suddenawakening eventually begins to understand their new state. Sooner or later theyfind clues and signposts that give them a sense of orientation. They open booksof spiritual teachings and realize, “Yes! This is what I’ve been through!” Theyfind themselves chatting to someone who meditates or follows a Buddhist orDaoist path and feel a sense of connection. Or they may remember a conversationthey had years ago — or a poem or passage from a book they read, or adocumentary they saw — that now seems to make sense. They begin to build up aconceptual framework to make sense of their wakefulness. Their own certaintybegins to override the doubts of the people around them.For example, one person described how after her awakening she felt “a little inthe wilderness, trying to understand what had happened to me” and began aprocess of “seeking, searching for answers.” She eventually discoveredmeditation and yoga, which she felt were instinctively right for her, andenabled her to understand and integrate her new state. Another person felt drawnto study counseling and discovered spirituality through psychotherapy andtranspersonal psychology.More than sixty years ago, when Russel Williams underwent his awakening, thisprocess of orientation could take a long time (several years in Russel’s case)simply because knowledge of spirituality was so hard to come by. But now thatspiritual knowledge is much more accessible, the process is easier.Difficult RelationshipsIn general, when people wake up, their relationships improve. People usuallybecome more empathic, compassionate, and considerate; they are better able toexpress love and affection. But their transformation may be so drastic andincomprehensible to the people around them that relationships can sometimes beproblematic, too. The awakened person changes so fundamentally that it can bealmost as if they’re a different person inhabiting the same body. For example,in chapter 8 [part0015.html#E9OE0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5] we saw thatKimberley underwent such a dramatic shift that when she went back home shedidn’t expect her friends and family to recognize her.Relationships that were once close and harmonious may become discordant. Oftenold friendships and family ties break down, and sometimes marital partnersseparate. A gulf opens up — shifters have changed so fundamentally while theirold connections have remained the same. Typically, relatives and friends arebemused by the awakened person’s new behavior and new personality. One shiftertold me that after her transformation, “I had very little in common with a lotof people who I knew. . . . Over time I have renewed some old relationships in adifferent way and let some go completely.”In some cases, friends and relatives resent the shifter’s new personality andfeel that they’re behaving selfishly, now that they’re living more authenticallyand honestly and exploring new avenues to make sense of their transformation.For example, one shifter created resentment because she felt the need to spend alot of time alone, to create as much space for herself as possible, rather thangiving her time to her family. Another woman was accused of being selfishbecause “I sometimes say no — I might have to say no because now I’m trying totake care of myself. I need to take time out.”The sense of authenticity shifters experience — and the responsibility they feelto be truthful — is another potentially tricky issue. They are sometimes toohonest and hurt other people’s feelings. They may be less willing to placatepeople, to tell people what they want to hear or sympathize with problems thatseem trivial to them. One shifter told me that she had less patience for friendswho complained about problems but didn’t do anything about them. Another womantold me that “my eighteen-year-old niece lives with me and sometimes I saythings which she may perceive as hurtful — but I’m just being truthful. . . .She’ll be making excuses but I’m asking her to take responsibility.”Relationship difficulties can add to the confusion and discord that often followsudden awakening, but it’s usually not long before shifters begin to form newconnections to replace the old ones. As they search for understanding of theirnew state, they meet people who share their spiritual interests, who are alsoexploring and expanding themselves and may have already experienced some degreeof wakefulness. Shifters usually form deep, open, and authentic relationshipswith these fellow self-explorers and so establish new friendship groups that areoften more fulfilling than the previous relationships.Psychological DisturbancesConfusion can be difficult enough to deal with, but sudden awakening can be evenmore problematic when it causes psychological disturbances. As mentioned inchapter 8 [part0015.html#E9OE0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5], psychologicaldisturbances are especially prevalent in energetic kundalini-like awakenings,but can sometimes occur in ego-dissolution, too. The awakened person may find itdifficult to think clearly or concentrate because their mind is overwhelmed withnew impressions, thoughts, and visions, or with subconscious mental materialthat was previously repressed. They may have problems with memory and difficultyorganizing their lives and making plans and decisions. They may find socialinteraction difficult. In extreme cases, they may even have problems speaking.It’s quite common for them to have to take extended time off work or to give uptheir jobs all together. If the incomprehension of the people around them hasmade them think that they might have gone mad, these disturbances may confirmit.These problems are the result of the sudden dissolution of the person’s previousself-system, together with their new sensory openness, which overwhelms themwith new impressions and perceptions. Psychological functions such as memory,concentration, and cognition are performed by the self-system, so when itdissolves these functions are disrupted, in the same way a computer crashes whenits programs are disrupted. The new self-system usually takes over thesefunctions fairly quickly, but the transition may not be smooth. You couldcompare it to a new political party winning an election and taking over acountry’s governance — there’s an initial period of uncertainty as the newpoliticians take over their new roles and find their footing.Some shifters find that they have to effectively retrain themselves to thinkconceptually and relearn basic mental functions. This parallels the way thatstroke victims sometimes have to retrain themselves to perform basic functions.Stroke victims, however, are mainly retraining the brain — reforming neuralconnections, training different parts of the brain to take over functions thatused to be performed by the now-damaged parts of the brain — whereas shiftersare training their new self-system to take over mental functions that used to beperformed by the previous one.One of the most dramatic examples of psychological disturbance is JC Mac’s,which I described in chapter 7[part0014.html#DB7S0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5]. His basic psychologicalfunctions were so disrupted that he couldn’t work. He found it difficult to holdconversations and often forgot to eat. Even several years after his sudden shifthe found it “difficult to function sometimes with the things that require mind,organizing.” Kimberley said she had “a short-term memory cycle of about thirtyseconds and everything was just sort of slipping through my mind.” In the sameway, Phoebe, whose sudden awakening in response to the death of her high schoolfriend was described in chapter 7[part0014.html#DB7S0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5], said she “had a lot oftrouble with long- and short-term memory, with work and simple tasks, and withcommunicating.” On her twenty-first birthday she kept forgetting that it was herbirthday; she only remembered when people wished her happy birthday. While inchapter 8 [part0015.html#E9OE0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5], we looked atthe examples of Simon and Eric, whose psychological disturbances led them to bediagnosed with mental illness.As with confusion, these psychological disturbances are usually only temporary.In extreme cases such as JC’s, they make take several years to fade away, but inalmost all cases shifters become psychologically integrated again and able tofunction in the everyday world. It’s partly simply a question of allowing theearthquake of sudden awakening to settle down and relearning conceptual andmental abilities. As shifters relearn the ability to concentrate, they learn todeal with their sensory openness and heightened perception by narrowing theirawareness when they need to. They learn the ability to control their attentionso that they can screen out their heightened reality when they need to focus onthe practical business of everyday life. For Kimberley, it was “two to threeyears” before she began “to feel stable and finally understand what washappening.” Similarly, Helen, whose sudden awakening we looked at briefly in theprevious chapter, told me how initially, “I thought I was going bonkers, but Iwas aware that I was going bonkers, and I had a sense that I needed to workthrough it, that it would play itself out. It lasted for about two years, beforeit started to stabilize.”Physical ProblemsThe third — and most severe, but also the rarest — type of difficulty that canarise after sudden awakening is physical problems. Even more than psychologicaldisturbances, physical problems are associated with energetic awakening becauseof the disruptive effects of the powerful explosion of energy that occurs. Andlike psychological disturbances, these physical difficulties can greatlyexacerbate the confusion that often comes after sudden awakening and increasethe likelihood of people being diagnosed with mental illness.The most common physical difficulties reported to me are sleeplessness, fatigue,and unexplained pains. (Not coincidentally, transpersonal psychologists haveidentified similar difficulties with kundalini awakening.) For example,Kimberley described how “I started to develop physical symptoms which stopped mein my tracks and that forced me to reassess. . . . My body was in pain. I wasfatigued but couldn’t sleep. I didn’t sleep properly for about eight months.”She was diagnosed with fibromyalgia, but began to recover with the help ofalternative therapies like Reiki. Similarly, Helen began to suffer fromunexplained pain and extreme tiredness and was eventually diagnosed with ME, orchronic fatigue syndrome. As she told me, “I was working in a bookshop at thetime but had to stop. . . . I was too ill to go out.” Another person experiencedsleeplessness together with a complete loss of appetite and an inability to feelheat or cold.When an energetic awakening occurs, it creates a massive upheaval that mayaffect a person’s whole organism, throwing it completely out of balance. Thecarefully regulated mechanisms that maintain homeostasis and health may bedisrupted. At the same time, the explosive energy that has been released insidethe person may make them feel too restless to relax or sleep, as if they’vetaken a powerful stimulant. In Waking from Sleep, I suggest that homeostasisdisruption can cause awakening experiences (such as when a person fasts orintentionally goes without sleep) but here the causality is reversed: theintense energetic awakening itself causes a major disruption to homeostasis.The Importance of Understanding and SupportThese difficulties illustrate how vital it is that people who experience suddenawakening are given support and understanding to help alleviate their confusionand help them deal with their psychological disturbances and any physicalissues. If they don’t realize that they’re undergoing a transformation into ahigher state then it’ll be all too easy to mistake their shift-up for abreakdown. Unless they are familiar with the signs of spiritual awakening, it’spossible that they will misread them. It will be easy for them to agree withrelatives and friends who suspect that they’ve gone mad. They may resist orsuppress the awakening process, and it’s more likely that they will fall intothe hands of uncomprehending psychiatrists.I’m a great admirer of such organizations as the Spiritual Crisis Network (basedin the UK) and the Spiritual Emergence Network (in the US) because of thesupport they provide. The express purpose of these groups is, as the website ofthe Spiritual Crisis Network states, to promote “understanding and support forthose going through profound personal transformation.”7 [part0027.html#rch10en7]A spiritual crisis is essentially what I’ve been calling sudden spiritualawakening. The symptoms of spiritual crisis, as identified by the SpiritualCrisis Network, are similar to the difficulties I’ve described in this chapter:feeling full of energy, hypersensitivity, the inability to sleep, and feelingalienated and adrift.”8 [part0027.html#rch10en8] Perhaps most importantly, theseorganizations provide advice on how to minimize the disruptive aspects of theshift, and how to ensure that it stabilizes and becomes integrated. For example,the Spiritual Crisis Network advises people to cut down on their activities andresponsibilities, to slow down and give themselves time and space to deal withtheir shift. It cautions against seeking therapy straight away — partly becausethere’s no need to open up and explore ourselves even further — but ratheremphasizes the importance of getting support from sympathetic and understandingpeople.It’s also important for us to remain as grounded as possible so that we don’tlose ourselves in the transpersonal phenomena we’re experiencing and losecontact with everyday reality. In order to keep ourselves grounded, the networkrecommends a diet of “heavy” foods such as grains, root vegetables, pulses,dairy products, and meats. Sleep is often disturbed during spiritual crisis sosedative herbs, or even — if all else fails — the occasional conventionalsleeping tablet, can be useful to help establish normal sleeping patterns.Exercise can also help to keep us grounded, as well as doing everyday tasks suchas cleaning, cooking, gardening, or walking the dog. Creativity is important asan outlet for our heightened sensitivity and our insights and impulses.If we remain grounded and receive support and understanding — and so are able tobuild a conceptual framework to make sense of our new state — then we shouldhopefully reach what the Spiritual Crisis Network calls the stage of reentry andreintegration. At this point, we’re stable enough to function in the everydayworld, even if we may need to undergo further adaption and integration.Of all of these different aspects of support, the single most important isprobably understanding. The simple realization that you are undergoing apositive transformation can be enormously affirming. It can immediatelytransform confusion into clarity and discouragement into determination. I’ve hadthis response many times to my own books and articles. I regularly receiveappreciative emails from people telling me that my writings have helped them tomake sense of their own experiences and made them realize that they’re not goingmad or having a breakdown. For example, I recently received an email from awoman who was helped by reading an article about spiritual awakening on mywebsite. She told me that she is from a small town in Pennsylvania and had “whatI now understand to be a spiritual awakening.” As she wrote to me:It was such a strange experience. I have only told five people. Three of themare members of my immediate family whom I know are spiritual. . . . I have noteven told my husband.My experience was almost the same as you described in your article on yourwebsite. It made me feel good to know others have gone through this. In my case,it started while I was in church and continued as I was driving home fromchurch. (I was by myself.) The powerful feeling lasted a couple of days thoughthe most intense moment lasted about 30 minutes.I have basically become a different person since. It’s like God zapped myinsides with a laser and all my past emotional pains are gone. . . like I had anemotional detox. During the experience I had a feeling of oneness with theuniverse, not feeling fear, not feeling afraid of dying. Before I used to alwaysthink about my dream condo and dream car. After the experience, I wasn’t sointerested in these things. . . . I don’t have the need to impress others.Before reading the article on your website, I was afraid people would think Iwas crazy. . . . I still don’t plan to broadcast this experience all over, but Iknow that if I choose to tell someone, I can show them this article.Now that more and more people are experiencing wakefulness — having temporaryawakening experiences, feeling the impulse to wake up, or undergoing suddenawakening — increased understanding and acceptance of the state is imperative.As a culture, we must begin to accept wakefulness as a natural and healthy state— one that is actually much healthier and higher-functioning than our normalstate and therefore more desirable for us all to move toward.Awareness is definitely spreading. Spiritual ideas are increasingly entering themainstream of our culture, as witnessed by the popularity of mindfulnessmeditation and of figures such as Eckhart Tolle and the Dalai Lama. Somepsychiatrists are even beginning to recognize the importance of spiritualexperiences and to view spiritual awakening as a valid psychological processrather than treating it as a form of psychosis. (In the UK, for example, aSpirituality and Psychiatry Special Interest Group exists within the RoyalCollege of Psychiatry.) So hopefully the kind of misunderstanding that we’veencountered so often in this chapter — and the confusion it creates in newlyawakened people — will soon fade away.Sudden Awakening and PsychosisThis is a good point to look at the relationship between spirituality andpsychosis in more detail. In chapter 8[part0015.html#E9OE0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5], we saw a number ofexamples of people who, after sudden energetic awakening, were seen bypsychiatrists, given medication, and/or confined to psychiatric hospitals.This misinterpretation of awakening as psychosis is a great shame, for tworeasons. First, it means that the awakening process is pathologized. Theawakening person is officially confirmed as having something wrong with them,that they are “going mad.” Any doubt and incomprehension they may have receivedfrom their friends is substantiated by the medical profession. As a result, theyare more likely to try to deny or suppress their awakening and less likely toreceive support and understanding. Second, medication may interfere with theorganic process of restabilization and integration that should follow awakening.Ironically, although medication may suppress some of the psychologicaldisturbances that sometimes arise with sudden awakening, it may actuallyperpetuate them in the long term — that is, stop them from fading awaynaturally.Such misinterpretation is unfortunate but perhaps not surprising because suddenenergetic awakening can certainly resemble psychosis. Unless a psychiatrist isaware of spiritual awakening as a process, which is still rare, then it’s alltoo easy for them to misread its symptoms.Differentiating Psychosis and AwakeningSome researchers believe that there’s no fundamental difference betweenpsychosis and spiritual awakening. Instead, they see a fundamental experience ofgoing beyond the boundaries of the normal self, which can become either apsychotic or a spiritual experience depending on different factors. IsabelClarke, one of the UK’s leading researchers on spiritual crisis, believes thatthe most important factor in determining whether a transpersonal experiencebecomes “a life-enhancing spiritual event” or a “damaging psychotic breakdownfrom which there is no easy escape” is how strong and stable a person’s sense ofself is — or, in her terms, the “well-foundedness” of the self, or“ego-strength.”9 [part0027.html#rch10en9] In other words, if a person doesn’thave a strong sense of self, they’re more likely to have a psychotic experience.Clarke believes that, rather than make a distinction between spirituality andpsychosis, we should think of a whole spectrum of “transliminal states ofconsciousness.” Other researchers argue that the only difference betweenspiritual awakening and psychosis stems from how the experience iscontextualized and labeled; that is, whether it’s supported or pathologized bythe person’s peers or wider culture.However, other researchers — including me — take the view that there is a basicdifference between psychosis and awakening. They aren’t just two variations ofthe same fundamental experience but two fundamentally different experiences thathave some similarities. The transpersonal psychologist Stanislav Grof, forexample, acknowledges that what he calls a spiritual emergency can resemblepsychosis in that the sudden eruption of new spiritual energies and potentialsmay feel threatening — even overwhelming — and cause disruption to normalpsychological functioning. However, Grof believes that a spiritual emergency isfundamentally different in that it usually features an “observing self” whostands apart from the psychological disturbance so that the person canrationalize and understand their experience to some degree. In psychosis,however, there’s no observer; the self is completely immersed in the experienceand so can’t control or integrate it. A person who is having a spiritualemergency has a sense of grounded detachment that is absent from psychoticepisodes.10 [part0027.html#rch10en10]Other researchers have identified a number of essential differences betweenpsychotic disorders and spiritual experiences. People who have visionaryspiritual experiences have good pre-episode functioning; that is, unlike peoplewith psychotic disorders, they tend to be well-adjusted and integratedindividuals without a history of psychological problems. The onset of theirsymptoms also occurs more quickly — usually during a period of three months orless — and they usually have a positive and curious attitude toward theexperience. In addition, people who have spiritual experiences are more likelyto have a sense of ecstasy and revelation, and they have a much reduced risk ofhomicidal or suicidal behavior.11 [part0027.html#rch10en11]All of these descriptions certainly fit with the experiences we looked at inchapter 8 [part0015.html#E9OE0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5]. Kimberley,Simon, and Eric were all convinced that they were undergoing some form ofspiritual or transformational experience even though everyone around thembelieved they were having psychotic experiences. Kimberley and Simon had littleor no previous knowledge of spiritual ideas or practices but still intuited thatthey were undergoing an important positive process. They were not completelycaught up in their psychological disturbances; they knew what was happening tothem and were able to observe the process with some degree of objectivity. BothKimberley and Simon had had good pre-episode functioning until bereavement (inKimberley’s case) and stress (in Simon’s case). Eric had had psychiatricproblems in the past but had been free of them for ten years, until he went toIndia to learn yoga.But perhaps the difference between psychosis and spirituality is more simple andfundamental than these researchers suggest. The similarity between them lies inthe fact that they both involve a disruption of the normal self-system and itsnormal functioning. When the normal self-system is disturbed by spiritualawakening, its functions also become disrupted, in the same way that anearthquake disrupts the basic infrastructure and amenities of a city. But thisisn’t strictly a breakdown because a new self-system emerges, howeverproblematically, to replace the old one. The disruption to psychologicalfunctioning is usually temporary since the new self-system soon takes over(again, even if this takeover is a difficult process) and the awakened personsoon relearns to conceptualize, concentrate, communicate, and so on. What mighthave appeared to be a breakdown is now revealed to be a shift-up, the birth of alatent higher-functioning self-system — that is, the wakeful self-system.In psychosis, no latent self-system emerges. There’s simply a breakdown, withouta shift-up. The normal self-system dissolves into a vacuum. No new self-systememerges to bring order to the disrupted psychological functions and structures.To continue with the political analogy I used earlier in this chapter, it’s asif a government dissolves itself without arranging for anyone else to take over.As a result, the country descends into chaos. Its infrastructure begins to fallapart, and its basic amenities and systems no longer function. In awakening, ofcourse, a new government takes over.This isn’t to say there aren’t similarities between psychosis and spirituality,besides the initial psychological disturbances that sudden awakening can cause.In both states we step outside the normal self-system, so it’s natural that theyshould share some characteristics. The main one is the intensified perception orheightened awareness that is often associated with schizophrenia. But even herethe difference is that, for a person with schizophrenia, heightened awarenessmay not necessarily be a positive phenomenon. It’s likely that a person withschizophrenia will lack the ability to control it so that it constantly intrudeson their attention. It’s also likely that they will interpret this heightenedreality as threatening because of their general sense of anxiety. Heightenedenergy and creativity are sometimes associated with both schizophrenia andwakefulness too. But again, a person in psychosis usually isn’t able to controltheir energy and may feel overwhelmed by it.The wakeful state and psychosis also share an altered sense of time. Inwakefulness, this may appear as a sense of transcending the past and the futureand becoming intensely present, or perhaps as an expansive sense of time inwhich time moves slowly or may not even seem to exist. But people in psychosisoften experience a sense of being lost in time, of being unable to estimate itor control it.It seems, therefore, that some of the same basic characteristics appear in bothpsychosis and awakening but in a different guise — in a positive manifestationin wakefulness and in a negative manifestation in psychosis. (I don’t want tostretch these similarities too far, though. Most of the major characteristics ofthe wakeful state such as heightened well-being, empathy, mental quietness, anda reduced need for group identity don’t occur in psychosis at all.)Psychosis and spiritual awakening may also sometimes overlap and merge. In somesituations, the relationship between them may be more complex than I suggesthere. For example, there may be a period of psychosis before a new self-systembegins to establish itself. Or perhaps there may be occasions when an emergingself-system is overwhelmed by psychotic disturbances and so temporarilydissolves away before returning and establishing itself properly later."},{"pageContent":"11. After the Storm: Lingering Traits and Questionable Teachers[part0005.html#rch11]The previous chapter makes clear that the process of awakening can be difficult,particularly when it occurs suddenly. But even once the initial awakeningprocess has run its course — even once a person has built a conceptual frameworkto make sense of their state, and even once the wakeful self-system has becomestable and well integrated — difficulties can still arise. Although we like toidealize enlightenment as a state of perfect bliss and ease, this is rarely thecase. Life certainly becomes more blissful and easy, but challenges and discordcan still occur.One issue is that an awakened person may have preestablished behavioral traitsthat carry over into their new state and may take a long time to fade away (ormay never fade away completely). In some cases, awakening may be a completelynew beginning, free of previous habits and traits. But in others, behavioraltraits associated with our old self-system may become attached to the new one.As a result, despite the general background of serenity and ease that comes withwakefulness, we may be surprised to find that we still experience some fears,anxieties, and other forms of psychological discord. For example, we may stilllack self-confidence in certain situations, or experience fear of flying orpublic speaking, guilt about some past events, self-aggrandizement, or ambition.(Such unwholesome mental states are called kleshas in Buddhism.)These traits don’t automatically fade away, even if we aren’t as affected bythem as we were before. They usually become less intense, and we’re usually lessidentified with them. We’re aware that these traits are just habits, mentalphenomena that aren’t part of our real identity. Our true self stands apart fromthem in the same way that it stands apart from thoughts that may pass throughour mind. We’re much less likely to latch onto the fears or feelings of guilt orambition, and so they’re less likely to become inflated. As a result, thiskarmic laundry does normally fade away over time.American philosopher Robert Forman underwent a shift into a wakeful state at theage of twenty-five. He had suffered from intense anxiety for as long as he couldremember (at least since the age of eleven) and had had a breakdown while atuniversity. He seriously contemplated committing suicide and spent several hoursstanding at the edge of a high bridge over the Chicago River with the intentionto jump off. He had his first glimpse into wakefulness during this period ofturmoil — a powerful awakening experience that occurred while driving a racingcar. As he describes it, “I was careering at some ungodly speed and all of asudden, everyone else in my life seemed to drop away. All my anxieties, all mythoughts and feelings, even the loneliness just disappeared.”1[part0027.html#rch11en1]Soon after leaving university Forman began to practice Transcendental Meditationand, after two years of regular practice, he woke up while on a TranscendentalMeditation teacher training course in Spain. (His story is similar to RusselWilliams’ in that many years of psychological turmoil were followed by a longperiod of intensive spiritual practice, leading to a moment of awakening.) As hedescribes his sudden shift in his book Enlightenment Ain’t What It’s Cracked Upto Be:My experience, indeed my life, became noticeably different than it had beenbefore that date: behind everything I am and do now came to be a sense ofsilence, a bottomless emptiness, so open as to be without end. The silence bearsa sense of spaciousness, or vastness, which extends in every direction. . . .Though it rapidly became too normal or everyday to seem amazing or ecstatic, itis quite pleasant and peaceful. Since that day, it has been what I am. . . .Vast silence has been the me that watches and lives and holds it all. I am,strange to say, infinite.2 [part0027.html#rch11en2]Since then, Forman has experienced a permanent inner quietness, with nothought-chatter running through his mind. Whereas before he had a “localized”sense of self, since then his sense of identity has been “strangely non-personalyet infinite openness,” with a strong sense of connectedness to hissurroundings.3 [part0027.html#rch11en3] In other words, he no longer experienceshimself as a separate self, enclosed in his own mental space. At the same time,he has had a strong sense of disidentification with his experience, ofwitnessing it without being involved in it.However, Forman also admits that his transformation at the age of twenty-fivedidn’t bring an end to negative emotions, nor did it make life easy or perfect.He still suffered from anxiety, still had relationship problems, still feltincompetent in his job, still daydreamed about having extramarital affairs, andeven went shoplifting on occasion. As the title of his book suggests, Formanconcludes that this is a problem of expectation, and that the idea thatspiritual awakening leads to a state of constant bliss — as well as a life ofethical perfection — is misleading. At the same time, he says that these traitshave faded over the decades, and now his enlightenment is much more integratedand less problematic.Even people who are naturally awake may experience these difficulties. They toomay have karmic laundry — negative traits and tendencies that are innate tothem, and have perhaps been carried over from previous lives. (In Hinduphilosophy, these are known as samskaras.) It’s extremely rare for a naturallywakeful person to be completely free of negative behavioral traits. D. H.Lawrence, for example, was certainly not a perfect human being — he had anexplosive temper, sometimes betrayed the trust of his friends (for example, bycasting them as unsympathetic characters in his novels), and could be vitriolicand bitter toward his critics. Even Walt Whitman resorted to unethical ways ofdrawing attention to his work, such as publishing articles under pseudonyms inpraise of his poetry and printing a eulogizing letter from Ralph Waldo Emersonwithout the latter’s permission. Whitman was sometimes accused of being vain andself-absorbed, too. When his contemporary Henry David Thoreau met him, forexample, Thoreau complained that Whitman talked about himself and his workalmost continuously for three hours.Even aside from the carryover of negative traits, the belief that awakenedpeople sail through life in a state of bliss and ease is romantic. They maysometimes feel sad, bitter, or irritated. They may sometimes suffer what mightbe called reactive negativity; that is, they may be affected by challengingcircumstances such as stress, rejection, relationship issues, or professionalfailure. They may feel hurt when relationships end or when projects fail. Theymay feel irritated when flights are delayed or when acquaintances exploit theirgood will.But even if they’re not wholly immune to this reactive negativity, wakefulpeople are certainly less affected by it. They have a more accepting attitudetoward negative situations. When they experience emotional pain due to failure,upheaval, or bereavement, for example, they accept the pain as inevitable andnatural and simply allow it to express itself, just as physical pain does. Andclosely related to this, just as with their negative personality traits, they’reless identified with negative emotions. They have the ability to observe themwithout being immersed in them. Without resistance or identification, they canallow them to pass through them naturally and easily, without leaving anypsychological damage.All of this depends to a large extent on how awakened a person is. The furtheralong the spectrum of wakefulness a person is, the less affected they are bynegative emotions and situations. People who experience a high degree ofwakefulness may be almost entirely free of reactive negativity, though I feelthat this is extremely rare. Even Eckhart Tolle, who I’d say experiences a highdegree of wakefulness, admits that he very occasionally experiences irritation.He once told an interviewer in response to the question, “Do you ever getirritated?” that the last time he could remember becoming irritated was a fewmonths ago. As he told the interviewer: “I was walking, and there was a big dog,and the owner wasn’t controlling it and it was pestering a smaller dog. I felt awave of irritation. But what happens is it doesn’t stick around, because it’snot perpetuated by thought activity. It only lasted moments.”4[part0027.html#rch11en4] This is also a good example of how quickly irritationfades away when we don’t identify with it.The same applies to thought-chatter. People at a high degree of wakefulness mayexperience no thought-chatter at all (like Robert Forman) and have the abilityto just think when they need to. Others at a lower degree of wakefulness mayexperience some mental chatter (although significantly less than normal) withoutbeing identified with it. As with emotions, they view their associationalchatter as an automatic process that they’re not obliged to pay attention to.When negative thoughts arise, they don’t latch onto them but allow them to passby so that they don’t generate negative states of mind.The Dangers of Becoming a Spiritual TeacherAnother problematic aspect of wakefulness relates back to the carryover ofnegative traits from our previous self-system. Until wakefulness is properlyintegrated, these traits may actually be amplified and — paradoxically — becomemore of a problem than they were before awakening. This is a particular dangerif an awakened person becomes a spiritual teacher.We tend to idealize spiritual teachers in the same way that we idealize thestate of wakefulness. We think of wakefulness as a state of perfect bliss and welike to think of awakened individuals as perfect people incapable of behavingbadly. We assume that anyone who attains the state — whether they decide tobecome a spiritual teacher or not — is incapable of selfishness, unkindness, ormistreatment of others.And these assumptions aren’t groundless. Wakefulness predisposes people toethical behavior. Wakeful people are more likely to treat other people withcompassion and fairness. Other people’s well-being often becomes as important as— or even more important than — their own. They’re often less likely to exploitpeople for financial gain or to use them as a means of satisfying their desiresfor power or sex.There are two reasons for this. First, in wakefulness we feel a heightened senseof empathy now that our self-boundaries are more fluid. We have a heightenedsense of connection with other people, a heightened ability to sense whatthey’re experiencing, which means we’re much less likely to inflict suffering orharm on them. Second, because we no longer have a separate sense of self, we nolonger need to strive to accumulate wealth and power (or fame or status) tomitigate our sense of insignificance and incompleteness. As a result, we nolonger need to exploit other people to satisfy these needs.Indeed, in chapter 2 [part0009.html#8IL20-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5] wesaw that most of the world’s spiritual traditions see compassion and altruism ascharacteristics of the wakeful state. In Buddhism, once a person becomesenlightened it becomes impossible for them to act impurely. They live in a stateof effortless sila, or “right conduct.”And yet. . . many spiritual teachers don’t behave in this way. They mistreat andexploit their followers, become prone to narcissism and megalomania, and sullytheir personal lives through excess and impropriety. Admirers of such gurussometimes try to defend them as exponents of “crazy wisdom” who test the loyaltyand resilience of their disciples or practice some form of divine play orobscure Tantric exercises. But these attempts at justification often seemdesperate and deluded. As Andrew Cohen, a spiritual teacher himself, writes:How could a spiritual genius and profoundly Awakened man like Da Free John, whomakes such a mockery of his own genius through his painfully obviousmegalomaniacal rantings, leave so many lost and confused? And how is it that histeacher, the Guru of gurus, the extraordinarily powerful Swami Muktananda, wholiterally jolted so many thousands far beyond what they imagined possible, couldleave behind him so much skepticism and doubt as to the actual depth and degreeof his attainment? How is all this possible?5 [part0027.html#rch11en5]The sad irony here is that in recent years Cohen himself has suffered manyaccusations of impropriety and misconduct from his followers, includingallegations of bullying and financial extortion. In 2013, as a result of theseaccusations, Cohen decided to step down from his role as a guru, after realizingthat “in spite of the depth of my awakening, my ego is still alive and well.”6[part0027.html#rch11en6]As Andrew Cohen asks, how is all this possible? Perhaps we shouldn’t besurprised if some spiritual teachers are narcissistic attention seekers. Afterall, what better role could there be for a narcissist than one that enables youto collect admirers and followers so easily, who are willing to sit in silencewhile you speak and obey you unquestioningly?But, as I’ve suggested, I don’t think this is the whole story. At least to someextent, the failings of spiritual teachers are the consequence of the roleitself. Teachers who are genuinely awakened to begin with can easily becomecorrupted by their power and authority, to the point that their wakefulnessdissipates and they become lost in self-indulgence and delusion. Their egosbecome inflated by the projections of their followers, who treat them as perfectbeings even when they behave unethically. Cruel or exploitative behavior isexplained away and the teachers lose their moral compass. The egos that theywere supposed to have dropped a long time ago become inflated to monstrousproportions.The problem is that, as I mentioned earlier, awakening doesn’t necessarily wipethe slate clean. Lingering tendencies to narcissism or authoritarianism canbecome amplified by the role of spiritual teacher. What might originally havebeen a tiny germ of a negative trait, which wasn’t even evident before, becomesa grossly obvious personality defect. A very slight predilection towardself-indulgence inflates into excess and degeneracy on the scale of a rock star.A person who decides to become a spiritual teacher soon after their initialawakening, before there has been time for negative traits to fade away, is inparticular danger of this. It’s also more likely to happen when Easternspiritual teachers move to the West, particularly if they are from a monastictradition. They may well be unused to permissive Western attitudes toward sexand find themselves unable to control their sexual impulses. They may have noexperience with wealth or be unable to deal ethically with the money that flowsfreely from their disciples. They may also be unable to cope with the overthedonism and materialism of Western culture. This certainly helps to explain thequestionable behavior of teachers such as Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche and Osho.It’s important to remember, though, that only a small proportion of awakenedindividuals become spiritual teachers. Most awakened individuals are content tolive quietly and simply, without drawing special attention to themselves. TheIndian philosopher and teacher Vivekananda once said that the enlightenedteachers we know of — like Ramakrishna or Ramana Maharshi — make up only a tinyfraction of the enlightened beings who have lived. Most awakened individualshave passed by unrecorded because they didn’t make an effort to proselytize ordraw attention to themselves. Some awakened people may feel an impulse to spreadtheir teachings, to establish themselves as gurus, and (in modern times) promotethemselves through social media, but others may be content to remain unknown.Some people may feel that they can help people best by sharing their insightswith them as spiritual teachers. Others may feel that they can help best inother ways — for example, by expressing themselves through creativity oraltruism; by working as counselors, community volunteers, or therapists. Thatawakened individuals become spiritual teachers is by no means automatic.One of the problems here is that the role of spiritual teacher is unregulated.Regulations to ensure that teachers behave responsibility or guidelines toprotect vulnerable people don’t exist. There’s no reliable means ofdistinguishing fraudulent or deluded teachers from genuine ones. In fact, one ofmy aims in researching the wakeful state was to identify all its maincharacteristics so that it’s easier to distinguish genuinely awakened peoplefrom frauds or narcissists. This was also my motivation for creating — with myco-researcher Dr. Kelly Kilrea — the “Inventory of Spiritual/SecularWakefulness” that appears as an appendix to this book.And this — the characteristics of the wakeful state — is going to be the topicof the next chapter.One point I’d like to re-emphasize here, though, is that wakefulness isn’t astate but a process. It’s not an end point but a different journey. It doesn’tmean reaching the end of the road but rather switching to a different road. Toextend the analogy, you could say that this road is higher up the side of themountain; the view is more panoramic and the scenery is more beautiful andvivid. There’s more space and time, and the journey is both calmer and moreexhilarating. But it’s still a journey, and there’s still movement and change.There’s still the possibility of progression or — in the case of some spiritualteachers — regression. There are still challenges to face. Our wakefulness canbecome corrupted and fade away. Or it can become more integrated, more refinedand intense, depending on the course we take."},{"pageContent":"12. What It Means to Be Awake: A New World and a New Self [part0005.html#rch12]Following our investigation into the different ways in which wakefulness canmanifest itself, I think it would be useful to highlight exactly what it meansto be awake. We’ve already looked at the characteristics of the wakeful state inrelation to spiritual traditions, but here I’ll summarize the characteristics asthey’ve emerged from my own research. Then we’ll look at where thesecharacteristics come from — that is, try to identify how the self-system ofwakefulness gives rise to them.For ease of understanding, I’ve divided the characteristics into fourcategories: perceptual, affective, conceptual (or cognitive), and behavioral.I’ll discuss the first two of these in this chapter, and the second two inchapter 13 [part0020.html#J2B80-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5]. As areminder, these are the same categories I used to describe the characteristicsof our normal sleep state in chapter 1[part0008.html#7K4G0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5]. The only difference isthat in chapter 1 [part0008.html#7K4G0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5] Idiscussed affective characteristics first and perceptual second. I’ve switchedthem around in this chapter because I think the affective aspects are mostprominent in sleep, whereas in wakefulness it’s the other way around: theperceptual aspects are more prominent.Let me point out again that these categories shouldn’t be seen as hard and fast.There’s a lot of overlap between them, and some of them are interdependent inthe sense that they help to generate one another. But as I’ve already said,because the landscape of the wakeful state is uncharted, I think categories canbe useful to provide some orientation.These characteristics are uniform. Typically, permanently awakened peopleexperience all of these characteristics and usually at roughly the same degreeof intensity. This uniformity is one of the most striking things to emerge frommy research and emphasizes the validity of seeing wakefulness as a distinctpsychological state. The only significant variation is in terms of the overallintensity of wakefulness. As I’ve hopefully already made clear, the continuum ofstates of wakefulness ranges from less intense to very intense. The intensity ofthe characteristics of wakefulness obviously varies according to the intensityof a person’s overall wakefulness. That is, if a person experiences a highintensity of wakefulness, they will obviously also experience a high level ofwell-being, a high degree of mental quietness, a very pronounced tendency towardaltruism, a very pronounced lack of group identity, and so on. The reverseobviously applies to someone with a lower intensity of wakefulness.It’s also worth noting that many of the characteristics I’m going to highlightare common to temporary awakening experiences, too. This particularly applies tothe perceptual and affective characteristics, such as intensified perception,increased presentness, and transcendence of separation. The conceptual andbehavioral characteristics that we’re going to look at in the following chapteraren’t as strongly associated with temporary awakening experiences. These areless immediate and more long-term traits, which take some time to manifest orestablish themselves.A New World: Perceptual CharacteristicsThe clearest way in which wakefulness manifests itself is in terms of thewakeful person’s different perception and experience of the world around them.Awakened individuals don’t perceive the same world as other people do. The worldis as different a place to them as the world of a child is to the world of anadult — or, you might say, as the world of a pre-civilized indigenous person isto the world of a modern Westerner.Intensified PerceptionIn wakefulness, perception is vivid and direct. Awakened people see the world ina very childlike way — struck by the wonder, beauty, and intricacy of phenomenathat other people take for granted and don’t pay much attention to. The world isa brighter, more fascinating and beautiful place to them. In particular, theyare captivated by nature — the amazing is-ness and beauty of the naturallandscape, the sky, and the sea; the strangeness, complexity, and intricacy ofanimals, plants, and other phenomena.This childlike worldview is part of the reason for the connection betweenwakefulness and art, and why so many poets and artists are awakened individuals.When you’re awestruck by the is-ness and beauty of your surroundings, you oftenhave an impulse to express or frame the experience, perhaps in a poem orpainting. Certainly this sense of awe was the mainspring of the work of poetssuch as William Wordsworth, Walt Whitman, and D. H. Lawrence, and painters suchas William Turner and Caspar David Friedrich.This intensity of perception is sometimes experienced as an openness toexperience or, in slightly different terms, an increased sensitivity. It’s as iffilters have been removed or shutters have been opened and, as a result, moreimpressions come into our minds and affect us more powerfully. What is normallya “measly trickle” of information, as Aldous Huxley calls it in The Doors ofPerception, becomes a powerful flood.1 [part0027.html#rch12en1] As we’ve seen,intensified perception can sometimes feel overwhelming in sudden awakening (asit can also be in psychedelic experiences), but it usually isn’t a problem oncewakefulness becomes established. We learn the ability to turn off our attentionto such impressions when we need to concentrate or think abstractly. In otherwords, we learn to consciously close down the shutters when we need to.All of the awakened individuals I interviewed commented on this intensifiedperception. One person told me how the world had become “sharper, more real,”while another was “struck by how fresh everything seems.” Another personremarked that “colours seemed brighter, more alive.” Others described a sense ofawe and a new appreciation for simple pleasures and activities like walking,cooking, eating, and simply attending to their surroundings. One persondescribed vividly how she had come to relish “simple things — a simple cup oftea, looking out of the window, the sunshine on the leaves, the wonderful greenof the trees.”Why does the wakeful state feature this intensified perception? The best way todescribe this type of perception from a psychological point of view isnonautomatic. We’ve seen how, in the sleep state, our powerful ego consumesmassive amounts of energy and perception becomes automatic as an energy-savingmeasure. But in the wakeful state, our sense of “I” is much softer and weaker,and isn’t surrounded and maintained by a constant whirl of thought-chatter. As aresult, it doesn’t consume as much energy so there’s no need for automaticperception. Our perception remains fresh and intense.Increased Presentness / TimelessnessWakefulness also brings a different perception of time or, you might say, ashift in time orientation. In wakefulness, the past and the future become muchless important, and the present becomes correspondingly more important. Awakenedindividuals spend much less time recalling past experiences or ruminating overpast events, just as they spend less time looking forward to the future,daydreaming about future events or focusing on future goals. Instead, they focuson their present experience, on the surroundings they’re in, the people they’rewith, and the sensations and impressions they’re having.For some people, this increased presentness leads to a sense of theexpansiveness of time. Time seems to somehow open up, slow down, or evendisappear all together. Kelly, the co-author of “An Inventory ofSpiritual/Secular Wakefulness,” described how, because of her presentness,“every day seems full. A day seems to last for such a long time.” Another persondescribed an awareness that “there is no time. . . . No past, no future, justthings appearing and happening. Everything just is.” Even more intensely, Lynn,who had a sudden awakening after the deaths of her husband and her mother (inquick succession), described “an intense mind-boggling feeling of the past, thepresent, and the future all existing at once.” This is the sense of the eternalnow that is sometimes described by mystics, when the past, future, and presentall merge into one.Why does wakefulness bring this different time orientation? It’s partly relatedto the awakened person’s intensified perception. Because their surroundings andtheir experience are more real and vivid, they naturally pay more attention tothem in the present. It’s also related to the inner quietness of the wakefulperson, particularly their lack of (or reduced) associational thought-chatter.One of the main reasons we normally spend so little time in the present issimply because we spend so much time immersed in thought-chatter. Ultimately,the past and the future are concepts created by the human mind. We neveractually experience either because our minds and bodies are always in thepresent. The past and the future only exist in thought, whereas the present doesnot exist in thought. A large proportion of thought-chatter is related to thepast or the future in some way. So the quieter our minds are and the lessimmersed we are in thought-chatter, the more present we are.In addition, as I suggest in my book Making Time, our normal linear perceptionof time is a mental construct generated by our strong sense of ego. The weakerour sense of ego becomes, the more linear time seems to fade away. Ourperception of time slows and expands — and eventually disappears into now-ness.Awareness of “Presence” or an All-Pervading Spiritual EnergyAt higher intensities of wakefulness, we become aware of a spiritual force thatpervades all things and the spaces between things. In my research, one persondescribed this as “a deep sense of a living presence within that is bothmagnificent and also very ordinary.” Another person described “a vast presencewhich is just infinite and pretty mind-blowing. Especially in nature.” Anotherperson spoke of an “awesome presence” that he referred to as “God.” This forceis sometimes described in terms of a “source,” something underlying andfundamental that doesn’t just pervade all things but gives rise to them, too. Ina sense, all things are the manifestation of this force.This force is clearly the same as what the Upanishads refer to as brahman — thespiritual force that pervades all things and the space between all things, andthat also manifests itself in human beings as atman, our own spiritual essence.Elsewhere, it’s conceptualized as the Dao (the Way) in Daoism, as the dharmakayaof Mahayana Buddhism, or in the energetic all-pervading form of “God” describedby Christian, Jewish, or Sufi mystics. It’s also fundamentally the same as theall-pervading spirit-force perceived by most of the world’s traditionalindigenous peoples. (As I describe in chapter 1[part0008.html#7K4G0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5], the Hopi Indians call itmaasauu, the Lakota wakan-tanka, and the Pawnee tirawa; the Ainu of Japan referto it as ramut, while in Africa the Nuer call it kwoth and the Mbuti call itpepo.)Our normal automatized perception prevents us from perceiving this all-pervadingspiritual energy. In our sleep state, when we look at the sky, we don’t see aspiritual energy shimmering through space; we just see empty space. When we lookat rocks or rivers or trees, we aren’t able to sense spiritual energy radiatingthrough them; we just see them as inanimate objects that we’re entitled to usefor our own devices. Due to the massive energy demands of the ego, our attentionis switched off to this spiritual force. As a consequence, the world that seemsto be so sacred and spiritual to indigenous peoples becomes a mundane, inanimateplace to us.Aliveness, Harmony, and ConnectednessAt a lower intensity of wakefulness, a person may not be aware of thisall-pervading spiritual force directly but they may still be able to indirectlysense its effects.One of these effects is a sense of aliveness. To the awakened person, there areno such things as inanimate objects. Even natural phenomena that aren’tbiologically alive (such as clouds, sea, or stones) and manmade objects (such aspieces of furniture or buildings) shine with the radiant aliveness of spirit.Objects that are biologically alive become more powerfully animate. One womandescribed how “everything looked and felt ultra real and alive. I kept staringout of the window and just marveling. . . . I could almost see the atoms ineverything I looked at. I had the strongest feeling that everything wasperfectly okay and perfect in the universe.”This woman’s recollection touches on another indirect effect of thisall-pervading spiritual force — a sense that “all is well.” As spiritual textsand mystics tell us, the nature of this energy is blissful. It has a quality ofbliss or joy in the same way that water has a quality of wetness. So when weperceive its presence in the world, there’s a sense of harmony — again, anawareness that is commonly described by indigenous peoples. We sense that theuniverse is a benevolent place and that harmony and meaning are its fundamentalqualities.Finally, this spiritual energy underlies and pervades all things and so createsa sense of connectedness or oneness. All things are folded into oneness in itsembrace. So even if an awakened person isn’t able to directly sense brahman inthe world, they may still have the sense that the boundaries betweensuperficially separate and distinct objects have melted away. They may stillsense what some of my participants described as “the oneness of everything” or“the oneness of the universe.”A New Self: Affective CharacteristicsWhen we wake up, our inner life changes. There’s a shift in how we feel inside,in our psychological experience.This shift changes us so profoundly that, in a general sense, we feel as if wehave a new identity, as if we have been reborn. Russel Williams describes thisvividly: “I felt like I wasn’t myself anymore, and began to wonder if I reallyexisted, because it was such a different existence. I had the same body, wasstill doing the same work, but with a completely different nature of mind. Itwas a new life, without a future.”2 [part0027.html#rch12en2]We do take on a new identity as the wakeful self-system emerges and replaces theold self-system of sleep. In cases of gradual awakening, this identity shifthappens very slowly, as the old self-system is gradually remolded into adifferent form. It may not even be noticeable, except in retrospect. In suddenawakening the shift is so abrupt and dramatic that many people can pinpoint theexact moment it occurs. In chapter 7[part0014.html#DB7S0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5], for example, Maritareported that her shift began at “March 2, 1993, about 8:30 am, Eastern StandardTime US.” Another person described her shift as “very sudden — instantaneousreally. It happened in February ’98.”So in this section we’ll examine the inner changes that contribute to thisoverall sense of becoming a completely different person.Inner QuietnessWith wakefulness comes a dramatic reduction of the inner noise of ourthought-chatter. In our normal state, this streams through our mind almostconstantly — a whirl of associations and images, worries and daydreams that onlyusually stops when our attention is absorbed in external things. Thisthought-chatter is such a normal part of our experience that many of us take itfor granted. We’re so immersed in it — and so identified with it — that we don’teven realize it’s there, and we certainly don’t realize how powerfully itaffects us. In my view, it’s one of the main sources of psychological suffering.It disturbs our inner world, giving rise to negative thoughts and emotions. Itdisconnects us from the essence of our being, constantly reinforces ourego-identity, and strengthens our sense of separateness.For both Eckhart Tolle and Russel Williams, the dramatic reduction of this innernoise was one of the most palpable immediate effects of their transformation.Russel describes how “I noticed that I wasn’t thinking anymore. My mind had gonequiet. I realized that knowing and thinking are two different things, and thatyou could know without thinking. I wasn’t forming opinions or jumping toconclusions anymore. I began to do things spontaneously, to live in themoment.”3 [part0027.html#rch12en3] Similarly, Eckhart told me, “My mind hadslowed down. It was far less active. There were long periods in my daily lifewhere there was no thinking or very little thinking or only important thinking.I was no longer identified with thought processes.”4 [part0027.html#rch12en4]Almost all of the awakened individuals I spoke to described similar experiences,although with variations. Some people — a small proportion — reported that theirminds had become completely quiet, with a complete cessation of thought-chatter.For example, one person described how her mind was “so calm and still it’sabsolutely wonderful. Sometimes I just sit and I wish everyone could have aquiet mind. When I see people getting impatient in a queue I think ‘I wish youcould have that quietness.’” Another person described how inside him “there isnothing there apart from a still silence, a very peaceful still unifying silencethat permeates everything.”More typically, though, people reported that there was still some thoughtactivity in their minds but much less than before. One person told me that hehad “nowhere near as much” thought-chatter as before, and that “a lot of thetime my mind is very still.” Another person also described an awareness of abackground of “silence” inside him and remarked that “because I notice thethoughts, because they are set against silence, they are not always there and Ino longer have the chatter endlessly.”Others reported that while thought-chatter was still there (although not as muchas before), they felt less identified with it. They were able to stand back,observe their thoughts, and let them flow by without becoming immersed in oroverly affected by them. For example, Graham described his discursive thinkingas “like walking into another room, with the TV playing in the background. Idon’t have to pay attention to it.” Another described his thoughts as “cloudsdrifting by. The point would be to let them drift; not invest life-force inthem.”When we speak about the thought-mind and aim to quiet it, it’s important toremember that thinking can be useful. In fact, being completely unable to thinkwould make our lives impossible. We often need to consciously deliberate inorder to make plans and decisions and to organize our lives. At a deeper level,streams of thought can also be useful in a creative sense, as a way ofgenerating ideas and insights.As an author and poet, I know how important both of these types of thinking are.A lot of my ideas come from a kind of deep daydreaming state, when impressionsand associations are flowing through my mind. And at later stages in thecreative process, it’s important to be able to edit and organize this rawcreative material, in order to mold it into a coherent, well-structured form(hopefully like this book!).Thought should be a tool that we use whenever we need it and then set down oncewe no longer need it. We should be able to think voluntarily and consciouslyrather than have a constant stream of involuntary associations and imagesrunning through our minds. Several people I spoke to described being able to“use” thought in this way. Graham remarked, “Sometimes I need to listen to [mymind] because I have things which need planning — going shopping, paying thebills. It’s a useful machine.” Similarly, another person said, “To use my mind,I have to zoom into a task. My mind is still, but it’s still used as a tool.”Some of these variations in the quality of inner quietness may be due todifferent degrees of wakefulness. Perhaps those who experience little or nothought activity are generally at a higher intensity of wakefulness than peoplewho still experience a significant degree of thought-chatter but no longer feelidentified with it.The question of identity is quite important because thought-chatter is fueled byour identification with it. In reality, our involuntary thought-chatter is justa process, not dissimilar to biological processes like breathing or thecirculation of blood through our body. The process is just taking place withinour consciousness rather than within our bodies. In the sleep state, we immerseourselves in the process; our thoughts become part of our identity and help todetermine our moods and feelings. This immersion keeps the thought-chatteractive, like gas fueling a car. But in the wakeful state, our identity isdetached from this process. We step back from it and, as a result, it loses someof its momentum. It becomes more subdued and less disturbing.Transcendence of Separation / Sense of ConnectionIn wakefulness, the sense of otherness between us and the world fades away. Weno longer feel that we’re “in here” looking out at a world that seems to be “outthere.” We no longer observe from a distance — we’re part of the flow of theworld’s unfolding is-ness. Separation dissolves into connection. In the same waythat we sense that all things are connected to each other, we feel that we’reconnected to all things. We’re part of the oneness of all things.This sense of connection manifests itself in different ways and at differentdegrees of intensity. At the most basic level, a person may feel stronglyconnected to other human beings, other living beings in general, or to the wholenatural world. For example, Eric, whose energetic awakening I described inchapter 8 [part0015.html#E9OE0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5] — told me that,“I feel a part of nature. . . . I feel a connection with people, but I also feelconnected with trees and birds and grass and hills.” A sense of connection tothe spiritual force that pervades the whole universe and that forms the essenceof our being may occur at higher intensities of wakefulness. In other words, wemay not just be aware of this spiritual force but also feel connected to it. Forexample, one person told me that she experiences life as “an interconnectedco-creative partnership with some kind of intelligent force or ever-presentsentiency.”At a still higher intensity of wakefulness, a sense of connection may intensifyinto a sense of oneness. A person may feel that they exist in a state of unitywith all things — even that they are all things. They may not just feel thatthey are one with the world but also that they actually are the world. Theirsense of separation may dissolve away to the extent that there’s no distinctionat all between them and what they perceive. For example, Kelly described how“the deep aliveness of space is so amazing it takes your words away. I don’tfeel connected to it. I feel like I am it.”All of this stems from the softer boundaries of the wakeful self-system. Theawakened person’s sense of identity isn’t confined to their own body or mind butstretches out and incorporates other phenomena. In our normal state, we’re likea wave that has somehow deluded itself into thinking that it’s a separateentity, distinct from the ocean that has given rise to it. But in the wakefulstate, we realize our true condition, as a part of the ocean.In this way, the sense of connection or oneness of the wakeful state is a directapprehension of the essential sameness of our being with the being of everythingelse that exists. It’s a direct apprehension of the oneness of our own atmanwith the all-pervading brahman. The essence of our own being is also the essenceof every other being and the whole universe itself.Empathy and CompassionThis sense of connection is closely linked to the high levels of empathy andcompassion associated with wakefulness. When we’re connected to other beings —animals and the natural world as well as human beings — we’re able to sense whatthey’re experiencing, to feel what they’re feeling. If they’re suffering, wesense it and feel the impulse to comfort them or try to alleviate their pain.We’re touched by other people’s pain because there’s no separation between ourbeing and theirs.In this sense, empathy is more than just a cognitive ability to imagine whatother people are thinking or feeling, or to look at the world from theirperspective. Empathy, in its deepest sense, is the ability to “feel with” otherpeople by experiencing a shared sense of being with them. This ability to “feelwith” other beings gives rise to compassion and love. Love stems from a sense ofconnection and oneness, a sense that you are another person — or other people —and so you belong to them and share their experience. Irene, who experienced asudden awakening after an abusive childhood and years of addiction, told me, “Ifeel a strong sense of compassion. I love people. I love helping people, loveencouraging people, love being around people.”Empathy gives rise to forgiveness, too. It enables us to understand the reasonswhy a person hurt or exploited us. It generates an impulse to establish a bondwith the person and eradicate the negativity between us and them. In addition,if a person behaves unkindly to us now, our empathy means that we’re less likelyto respond with hatred, desire revenge, or create conflict. Another woman whosuffered abuse described how “one of the major effects of awakening was comingto a place of love and forgiveness for those who abused me and the understandingthat came about what was going on — I began to see all that happened in thelight of the bigger picture. A great love grew inside me for them.”Well-BeingWell-being is perhaps the most obvious affective change generated bywakefulness, but I’ve saved it until now because it’s partly the result of twoof the previous affective characteristics, “inner quietness” and “sense ofconnection.”Awakened individuals may not live in a state of complete uninterrupted bliss,but they are generally much more content than other people. One major source ofthis well-being is freedom from the psychological discord that plagues humanbeings in our sleep state — habitual worry about the future, feelings ofnegativity about the past, and a general sense of unease. Awakened people aremuch less prone to negative states such as boredom, loneliness, anddissatisfaction. The atmosphere of their inner world is less charged withnegativity and much more harmonious.Many people I spoke to commented on this freedom from worry and anxiety. As oneperson described, “Something inside me has changed in the way that I don’t worryabout anything — I know everything’s okay. . . . I feel a huge sense of peace.”Similarly, Irene described how “I’m at peace. I’m free, I don’t worry about athing. I don’t have anything to worry about. I don’t live with stress.” Moregenerally, others described an “inner contentment” and “peace and a sense offreedom.” Even more powerfully, a person described how “most of the time thereis absolute bliss. A deep lingering peace which is unshakeable, which is justanchored.”This freedom from psychological discord is mainly the result of the awakenedperson’s inner quietness and their transcendence of separation. After all, thediscord is generated by the disturbance and negativity of our normalthought-chatter. Our normal sense of separation creates a sense of lack andfragmentation, as if we’ve broken off from the whole. So to experience an innerquietness and a sense of connection means freedom from psychological discord.This inner quietness and lack of separation have another effect that is relatedto well-being: they allow us to experience the spiritual essence of our being.In the sleep state, we’re usually cut off from this essence because we’reenclosed within the strong boundaries of our ego. In the metaphor I use inchapter 1 [part0008.html#7K4G0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5], the ego islike a big city that is separated from the whole landscape and can’t sense thefresh radiance of the countryside. But since the wakeful self-system is sosubtle and unobtrusive, like a small eco-town rather than a big city, and islargely free of the fog of thought-chatter, we can sense the radiance of thewhole natural landscape. We can feel the spiritual energy of our being flowingthrough us freely. This energy is essentially the same spiritual force thatpervades the universe. As the Upanishads put it, brahman is also atman, our ownspirit. The nature of this energy — whether in us or in the world — is bliss.When we experience this energy inside us, we experience its bliss. It fills uswith a natural and very palpable sense of joy.Finally, the well-being of wakefulness is related to a sense of appreciation. Inwakefulness, people are more likely to feel a sense of gratitude for theirhealth, freedom, loved ones, and other good things in their lives. In our sleepstate, we likely take these things for granted and fail to appreciate their truevalue. (I’ll explore this in more detail in the discussion of conceptualcharacteristics in chapter 13[part0020.html#J2B80-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5].) Appreciation isimportant in terms of well-being because it helps free us from wanting. In thesleep state, our dissatisfaction with our lives as they are — together with theimpulse to escape from our psychological discord — puts us into a state ofconstant wanting. We feel a constant desire to escape our dissatisfaction bygetting more of what we already have or different things to replace what wehave. We desire pleasures, possessions, success, status, and many more things asa way of trying to alleviate our dissatisfaction and discord. And we often gettrapped in a vicious circle. Wanting is generated by dissatisfaction, and thevery act of wanting creates further dissatisfaction. Envisaging our desires andstriving to satisfy them makes us even more dissatisfied with our present lives,in the same way that looking at photographs of a rich person’s lavish housemakes us feel more dissatisfied with our own house. But in wakefulness we’refree of this cycle of wanting. In Buddhist terms, we become free of craving andso free of the psychological suffering this creates.Absence of (or Decreased) Fear of DeathAbsence of (or decreased) fear of death is another contributing factor to thewell-being of awakened individuals and, at the same time, a significantcharacteristic of the wakeful state.Fear in general decreases in the wakeful state. A great deal of fear comes fromanticipating the future, so the presentness of awakened individuals mitigatesthis. A great deal of fear also stems from the fragility of the separate ego — afear of being psychologically or emotionally wounded by disrespect and a fear ofpsychological attachments being taken away. The increased inner security of thewakeful state (a characteristic that I’ll discuss very shortly) diminishes this.As the Upanishads tell us, when we become one with the world, fear disappears.In other words, fear is created by our sense of separateness, which makes usfeel vulnerable and threatened by the world.Fear of death is our most fundamental fear. The ego feels especially fragile inthe face of death. The fact that death could strike us down at any moment — andwill eventually reduce everything we have achieved and accumulated to nothing —creates a basic sense of meaninglessness, especially if we don’t believe in thepossibility of life after death. It’s therefore not surprising that, in modernsecular Western cultures, death has become a taboo subject. We try to avoidcontemplating or talking about it.To lose one’s fear of death is therefore a powerful and liberating experience.For example, Eric described how he had “no fear of death anymore. I’m not in arush to die, but I’m not attached to the body and the life and the possessions.Life is a miracle and a mystery, and I’m happy with that.” Similarly, Chris, whoexperienced gradual awakening following a long period of turmoil in his life,told me that he felt “very calm about [death]. . . . I would quite be willing toaccept it if I was told my death was to come, even though I don’t want to diejust yet.”This decreased fear of death is related to the transcendence of the separateego. Because our own ego isn’t the epicenter of our universe anymore, its demiseno longer seems such a tragic prospect. We know that our own death isn’t the endof all things; the world that is part of our identity will continue.The awakened person’s freedom from psychological attachments is important, too.In the sleep state, we try to accumulate attachments like possessions,achievements, and success to support our fragile sense of self. We fear death,in part, because we know that it will take all of these attachments away fromus. In wakefulness, we don’t cling to these things so much and so it’s easierfor us to let go of our lives and accept death.However, perhaps the main reason why the awakened person loses fear of death isbecause of a different attitude toward — and understanding of — death. Awakeningbrings an understanding that death isn’t the end, that the essence of our beingwill continue to exist after the dissolution of our bodies. Maylene, whounderwent awakening a few years after the death of her young daughter, told me,“We’re just like little fireflies — bursting forth from this main energy. We’rejust sparks and we go back to that source and we spark some more.”From the materialistic worldview derived from our sleep state, it seemscompletely clear that there’s no life after death. Our consciousness is just theproduct of brain activity; when our brain stops functioning, our consciousnessceases, too. But from the awakened perspective, reality is more complex thanthis. The essence of our being transcends our brain and our individual identity.Death isn’t the end of consciousness but a transformation of consciousness. Asone person told me, “I believe that death is a part of life. It’s just atransition to a different state.” Another person, Andreas, described death as“just a passing to another state where the soul separates from the body andunites with the universal soul.” In this sense, the duality between life anddeath seems to fade away in the wakeful state, in the same way that the dualitybetween us and the world or between us and other human beings fades away.Along with not seeing death as an end, the wakeful state brings a new sense thatdying isn’t a painful process to be dreaded but is potentially a positiveprocess of liberation. Helen, whose energetic awakening I described in chapter 9[part0016.html#F8900-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5] — explained how she “usedto think there was absolutely nothing. I thought people who believed in lifeafter death were idiots. . . . I’m not afraid of death at all — in fact, in someways I think it’s something to look forward to, a kind of liberation.” Marita,who underwent sudden awakening amid the turmoil of having a new baby (asrecounted in chapter 7 [part0014.html#DB7S0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5]),described dying in terms of going “back home again,” of being “outside of time,outside of space. . . like stepping outside of prison walls.”image [../images/00006.jpeg]There are two further affective characteristics that I should mention, eventhough they didn’t show up as major themes in my research. The vast majority ofthe characteristics I describe in this chapter were reported by all (or almostall) of the people I interviewed, but these two were only mentioned by around ahalf of my participants. This doesn’t mean that the others didn’t experiencethem; perhaps these themes didn’t strike them as being so significant and sothey were less likely to mention them.Heightened / Increased EnergyIt’s not surprising that some people mentioned having more energy followingawakening. We’ve seen that the dissolution of the normal self-system makesavailable a large proportion of energy previously monopolized by the ego. We’vealso seen that there is an explosive release of highly concentrated libidinalenergy in sudden energetic awakenings.In Waking from Sleep, I suggest that most awakening experiences are linked to an“intensification and stilling of life-energy (ISLE).” And in ongoingwakefulness, we experience this ISLE state continuously. One person told me thathis high level of energy was the result of the “freeing up” of energy thatpreviously had been used in seeking, that is, in trying to find happiness andfulfillment. Now that his seeking had fallen away, he found that “it frees up myenergy to find out what I’m really interested in, just for the sheer enthusiasmof it.” Maylene told me how, since her awakening, she had “incredible amounts ofphysical energy.” She described how this energy had helped to heal her physicalproblems and enabled her to lose “close to a hundred pounds in the last threeyears.”Inner SecurityAwakened individuals feel as if they have uncovered a core self that is somehowdeeper and truer than the self they knew before. In retrospect, their previousself seems a construct, made up of environmental influences and other people’sexpectations. As Kimberley put it, “Now I’m more authentic and more aligned andin tune with who I really am.” This new core self is firm and strong, lesseasily swayed by other people’s judgments and less affected by slights andperceived disrespect and negative (or even positive) life events. It givesawakened individuals a sense of equanimity, which means that, in the words ofthe Bhagavad Gita, they are “the same in pleasure and pain. . . what is pleasingor displeasing leaves [them] in peace.”5 [part0027.html#rch12en5]"},{"pageContent":"13. What It Means to Be Awake: A New Mind and a New Life [part0005.html#rch13]Most of the perceptual and affective characteristics I discussed in the lastchapter are probably familiar to you if you already have some knowledge ofspirituality. You’ve probably heard spiritual teachers talk about thepresentness and inner quietness that awakening brings. You’ve probably readspiritual texts that describe the serenity that awakened individuals experienceor the radiant all-pervading spiritual force that they perceive. However, theconceptual and behavioral characteristics we’re going to look at in this chapterprobably aren’t so familiar to you. They’re rarely mentioned by spiritualteachers and authors, most of whom view wakefulness purely in perceptual andaffective terms — that is, involving a different vision of the world and adifferent experience of being. The classic studies of mysticism by EvelynUnderhill, Walter Stace, or Richard M. Bucke barely touch on these aspectseither.Part of the reason why these conceptual and behavioral characteristics aren’t sofamiliar is because, as I mentioned at the beginning of the last chapter, theydon’t feature in temporary awakening experiences. They’re also less obvious thanthe perceptual and affective characteristics. The conceptual characteristics inparticular are more deep-rooted and subtle, and less frequently expressed.Whereas characteristics such as intense perception and a sense of well-beingexpress themselves fairly constantly, the conceptual characteristics areunderlying psychological traits, which may only become manifest in certaincircumstances.In addition, these characteristics have been neglected due to the influence ofotherworldly spiritual traditions, which imply that wakefulness doesn’t belongin everyday life. After all, according to some spiritual traditions, we have toseparate ourselves from the everyday world — take refuge in monasteries andhermitages — in order to wake up. And when we wake up, don’t we realize that theeveryday world is an illusion and that its goings-on are trivial? Some modernteachings promote a similar attitude by suggesting that both the world and theself are illusions, and that the events and concerns of our daily lives are justinsubstantial “stories.” Such attitudes discourage us from considering how ourlifestyles and attitudes might be transformed by waking up.As a consequence, the conceptual and behavioral characteristics are some of themost interesting findings from my research. It is fascinating to learn howawakening changes people’s outlook on the world, their attitudes, and theirlifestyles.A New Mind: Conceptual and Cognitive CharacteristicsThe conceptual characteristics we’re going to look at refer to how awakenedpeople see themselves in relation to the world and other human beings, and howthey conceive of the world and other human beings. It’s useful to think in termsof perceptual awareness, which is the direct awareness of the phenomenal worldaround us, and conceptual awareness, which is our understanding of the world,our own lives, and the whole human race. We’ve seen that wakefulnessdramatically changes our perceptual awareness and the same is true of ourconceptual awareness.Lack of Group IdentityAs I mentioned in chapter 1[part0008.html#7K4G0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5], in the sleep state wehave a strong tendency to identify ourselves, to give ourselves labels in orderto enhance our fragile sense of self. We like to define ourselves in terms ofour religion, ethnicity, nationality, and political affiliation, and also by thelabels of our careers, achievements, and qualifications. Defining ourselves inthese ways gives us a sense of belonging, and bolsters our egos. We feel thatwe’re not alone; we’re part of something bigger than ourselves.In wakefulness this need for identity and belonging fades away. People no longerfeel affiliated with any particular religion or nationality, just as they nolonger feel defined by their careers or their achievements. They no longer feelthat they are Americans or Jews or scientists or socialists. They don’t feel anypride in their nationalities, ethnicities, or qualifications. And they don’thave a sense of otherness or feel enmity to members of other groups. They feelthat such labels are superficial and meaningless. They don’t see any differencebetween Americans or Iraqis, Christians, or Muslims; they treat all people withequal respect. If they see themselves with any kind of identity, it’s as globalcitizens, inhabitants of the planet Earth, beyond nationality or border.1[part0027.html#rch13en1]In my research, Simon and Graham exemplified this lack of identity and the needfor belonging. They both used to be big fans of soccer teams. After theirtransformation, they no longer feel the need to support their teams, althoughthey still feel a strong enjoyment for the game itself. As Simon, whoseenergetic awakening I described in chapter 8[part0015.html#E9OE0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5], reported, “Even my loveof football has waned. It was a massive part of my life but that desire tobelong has pretty much gone. Everyone seems to need to belong to a particulargroup but I don’t need that anymore.” Similarly, Graham told me that “I don’tsupport a football club anymore. . . . Now I just watch football matches and Ijust think ‘I hope they all win.’ I enjoy the game for its own sake.” Grahamalso said that he no longer thinks of himself as English or even as male.Ed, whose account of awakening through regular spiritual practice combined withprofessional failure was covered in chapter 6[part0013.html#CCNA0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5], described a similarattitude. Living in the Midwest of the United States, Ed identifies himself as“a citizen of the cosmos. I don’t have any sense of regional or politicalidentity — and around where I live a lot of people do.”Awakened individuals often have a similar attitude toward different spiritualtraditions, too. Even if they are affiliated with a particular tradition, theydon’t feel that this tradition is the only true and valid one, as religiousfundamentalists do. They have an open and ecumenical attitude, and theyrecognize that different traditions are simply expressions of the sameunderlying truths. In the words of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna, who frequentlyread the Christian Gospels and the Qur’an, “All religions are true — as manyfaiths, so many paths.”2 [part0027.html#rch13en2]Wide Perspective: A Universal OutlookAwakened individuals have a wide sense of perspective, a macrocosmic outlook.They aren’t preoccupied with their personal problems and concerns to theexclusion of everything else. They know they’re not the center of the universe.This means that they have an awareness of the wider impact of their individualactions. They’re aware of how their life choices affect others, or the earthitself, and so are more likely to live ethically and responsibly. For example,they may decide not to buy or use goods that are produced by exploited workersor oppressive regimes. Aware of how their own lifestyle could contribute todamage to the environment, they’re more likely to adopt an environmentallyfriendly lifestyle.This wide perspective also means that, for awakened individuals, social orglobal issues are as real and important as their own personal concerns. They’relikely to feel a sense of concern for oppressed groups, social problems likepoverty and inequality, or global problems like climate change and theextinction of other species.Heightened Sense of MoralityThis wide sense of perspective has moral implications. As we have seen, awakenedpeople tend to be more ethical and responsible, more compassionate andaltruistic. But awakening also fosters a more all-encompassing and unconditionaltype of morality. Awakened individuals don’t practice moral exclusion; that is,they don’t just show concern and kindness toward people with whom they sharesuperficial similarities of religion or ethnicity but extend their benevolenceto all human beings indiscriminately. (This is obviously related to a lack ofgroup identity.)Another moral aspect of wakefulness is that the awakened person’s sense of rightand wrong (or good and bad) isn’t culturally determined but stems from an innateknowing, a deep moral certainty that transcends their own self-interest andculture. For awakened individuals, justice and fairness are universal principlesthat transcend laws or conventions. They may even break laws and potentiallysacrifice their own well-being — perhaps even their lives — in order to upholdmoral principles. It’s therefore not surprising that many of the world’s greatidealists and social reformers such as Mahatma Gandhi, Archbishop EmeritusDesmond Tutu, Martin Luther King Jr., and Nelson Mandela were awakened to somedegree (or at least experienced moments of wakefulness).3[part0027.html#rch13en3]Appreciation and CuriosityIn the sleep state, the process of familiarization that switches off ourattention to the phenomenal world acts on our conceptual awareness, too. Itswitches off our attention to things we should ideally feel grateful for. I callthis the “taking for granted syndrome,” which means that rather than feelinggrateful for what we have, we feel dissatisfied. Rather than appreciating whatwe have, we want more.But awakened individuals do feel grateful. They don’t get used to the goodthings in their lives once they’ve had them for a while. They appreciate thevalue of their health and their freedom, the beauty and benevolence of theirpartners, and the innocence and radiance of their children. They have theability to count their blessings, no matter how long they have had them. Theyfeel a profound sense of gratitude for small and simple experiences. (As we sawin the last chapter, this is an important factor in the well-being of thewakeful state.) For example, Phoebe, who experienced an awakening following thedeath of her high school friend, described how she “felt profound love andgratitude toward everyone in my life, everyone who was alive, and for everythingI saw and experienced.” Cathy, who had an awakening after being diagnosed withbreast cancer, described how she “began to feel real gratitude for the birdsvisiting my garden, the rays of sunshine streaming through trees; the light tookon a richness which I found so beautiful.” More generally, a person told me howher awakening had led her “to inner contentment and an intensification ofgratitude.”This sense of appreciation also leads to curiosity and openness. Becauseawakened people don’t take life itself for granted, they are always open to thenew and unfamiliar. They don’t feel satisfied with what they already know andnever feel that their understanding of the world is complete. They’re eager toexplore new ideas and skills, take on new challenges, travel to new places, andso on. This is another way in which they’re similar to children. The world is afascinating place to them, and they’re keen to explore it more deeply.A New Life: Behavioral CharacteristicsThe behavioral characteristics we’re going to examine now are the outwardexpression of the perceptual, affective, and conceptual characteristics we’velooked at already. They are the fruits of those inner changes, expressingthemselves in terms of new traits, habits, and ways of living.Altruism and EngagementSpiritually developed individuals are commonly believed to be detached from theworld and not particularly concerned about what is happening in it. Theirenlightenment supposedly makes them indifferent to the trials and tribulationsof ordinary people in everyday life. We imagine them sitting on mountaintops orin monasteries, basking in their own self-realization.This belief isn’t completely without foundation. As we’ve seen, some spiritualtraditions — most obviously the monastic traditions of Buddhism, Hinduism, andChristianity — aspire to otherworldliness and detachment. Some spiritualtraditions and teachers (such as the Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy and somemodern-day nonduality teachers) also maintain that the world is an illusion andso imply an indifference to pain and suffering. Why should we be concerned withsuffering when it’s fundamentally unreal?Or from a slightly different perspective, some teachings hold that although theworld may be real in itself, its seeming difficulties are unreal. The worldexists in a state of perfection, so how can problems exist? “Everything is justas it was meant to be.” Such attitudes certainly promote a detachment from theworld and a disregard for social or global problems.In my research I’ve consistently found the opposite to this kind of detachment —awakened individuals tend to become more altruistic. Altruism is the naturalfruit of the awakened person’s strong capacity for compassion, their universaloutlook, and their innate sense of justice. We feel a strong impulse toalleviate other people’s suffering and to help people fulfill their potential.We have a strong idealistic desire to change the world for the better, animpulse to serve other people and contribute to the human race in some way. Wemay feel a sense of mission, to help the human race move through our presentphase of chaos and crisis into a new era of harmony. (I certainly feel this;it’s the mainspring of all of my writings.) As one person told me, “Now I feel avery strong sense of purpose and sense of spiritual calling. I feel called toserve the evolution of human consciousness, to support others throughawakening.”Enjoyment of Inactivity: The Ability to “Be”Awakened individuals love doing nothing. They relish solitude, quietness, andinactivity. In my book Back to Sanity I suggest that this is one of the mostobvious differences between living in a state of “humania” — that is, our normalstate of human madness — and in a state of inner harmony. In humania, which isequivalent to a state of sleep, people find it difficult to do nothing or bealone with themselves because this means facing the discord of their own beingand the turbulence of their thoughts. As a result, they feel impelled to seekdistractions and activities — that is, external things in which to immerse theirattention — so that their attention doesn’t turn inward, into their own being.But in a state of harmony, which is equivalent to wakefulness, this isn’tnecessary. We can rest contentedly within our own being because there’s noturbulence or discord inside us. We don’t need to constantly do things just forthe sake of it or constantly supply ourselves with distractions. Rather thanfear quietness and inactivity, we enjoy them deeply because they allow us totouch into the radiance of our own well-being.Many of my participants mentioned this. Susan, who experienced gradual awakeningdue to spiritual practice and self-investigation, described how “I really lovemy quietude. It gives me the chance to read and delight and meditate in adifferent way that allows for reflection and for an ever-deepening.” Anotherperson gave me a beautiful description of how “the silence is so beautiful. Inthe silence everything is taken care of. It’s so nice just to sit and donothing. That’s one of my favourite times. I can just sit in silence for hours.”Others described how their ability to be meant that they were never bored, evenif they had nothing in particular to do. Simon, whose energetic awakening Idescribed in chapter 8 [part0015.html#E9OE0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5],noted that “some people cannot sit still and get bored very easily. I don’t getbored anymore. I only work two days per week and all I do otherwise is readbooks, go for walks, and meditate.” In a very similar way, some people describedthat they never felt lonely, even if they were alone for long periods. As oneperson told me, “I can be on my own for long periods of time and doing nothingand that is okay with me.”This is definitely true of my own experience, too. I’m an active person in someways — I’m quite productive as a writer; I teach at my university, read a lot,and spend a lot of time with my kids. But I absolutely love quietness andsolitude, and I honestly can’t remember the last time I was bored. Even before Ihad a family, I spent long periods without a girlfriend or without a regular joband don’t remember ever feeling lonely or bored. I agree with D. H. Lawrence,who wrote: I never know what people mean when they complain of lone-liness. To be alone is one of life’s greatest delights, thinking one’s ownthoughts. . . . and feeling oneself uninterrupted in the rooted connection with thecentre of all things.4 [part0027.html#rch13en4]In the sleep state, the constant need for distraction and activity is like adrug addiction; it’s a constant struggle to keep ourselves supplied with what weneed, and we often feel uncomfortable and anxious between our fixes. So to befree of this nagging need makes life much easier.Beyond Accumulation and Attachment / NonmaterialismIn wakefulness, the impulse to accumulate falls away. It’s no longer importantfor us to try to accumulate possessions, wealth, status, success, or power. Insleep, the urge to accumulate is a response to our sense of incompleteness andfragility. We try to bolster our sense of self by adding possessions,achievements, and power, in the same way that an insecure king continuallybuilds up a castle and reinforces its walls. Alternatively, we become overlyattached to preexisting aspects of our identity, such as our appearance or ourintellect. We derive a sense of specialness from them, which also serves toreinforce our fragile sense of self. But these efforts are no longer necessarywhen we wake up because that sense of incompleteness and vulnerability no longerexists.Some people I spoke to described the falling away of accumulative impulses asone of the most visible effects of their new state. They recognized that beforetheir transformation they had tried to offset their inner discontent by spendingmoney or accumulating wealth, but those impulses had now disappeared. Marcusdescribed how he had been “absolutely focused on being a millionaire.” He had alucrative career as a health consultant, giving talks around the country andappearing regularly on television. He drove a luxury car and bought the mostexpensive clothes and consumer goods. At the same time, he was deeply unhappyand reached the point of contemplating suicide. He had had a number of glimpsesof wakefulness before, amid his turmoil, but now he underwent a permanent shiftof being. After this shift Marcus off-loaded most of his possessions and washappy to share an old secondhand car with the rest of his family.Similarly, Simon told me that he used to be “consumed with having the latestbiggest car and gadgets” but now “this has all dissolved into thin air.” Kellydescribed how “I used to shop and be addicted to home and garden television. . .. I was looking to possessions as a way to feel better but now I don’t need tofeel better. . . I don’t need things.”Awakening brings a shift away from accumulation to contribution. The energy thatpeople invested to try to alleviate their own psychological suffering is nowredirected to try to alleviate the sufferings of others. As Marcus aptlydescribed it, there’s a shift in focus from “what I can get from life to what Ican give to life.”Autonomy: Living More AuthenticallyIn the sleep state, most people are products of the environment they are borninto. They tend to conform to the values of their cultures and happily go alongwith the kinds of lifestyles that are expected of them. But awakened individualstend to be more autonomous and inner-directed. They feel less identified withtheir culture’s values; they are likely to reject them in favor of followingtheir own impulses. They have greater confidence in their choices andpreferences, and are more liable (partly because of their inner security) tostand by them, even in the face of ridicule or hostility. They live their livesaccording to their own sense of what is right, rather than trying to pleaseothers or doing what is expected of them.5 [part0027.html#rch13en5]One person described this sense of autonomy in terms of having “more courage todo what I believe in now. I am going to trust my instincts more and my innerknowing, rather than listening to what others think is the right thing to do.”Kimberley told me, “It’s very important for me to follow my own rhythms andcycles, whereas before I was disconnected from that, pushing myself based ontimescales and diaries and expectations. Now I’m more authentic and more alignedand in tune with who I really am.”Strictly speaking, this sense of autonomy is a conceptual characteristic, butI’ve included it here because it’s difficult to separate from the new way oflife it gives rise to. People often realize that, prior to awakening, theyweren’t really living their own lives but largely just following socialconventions or trying to please other people. But after awakening it becomesmuch more important for them to live authentically and follow their ownimpulses. Other people may see them as rebels or eccentrics because they’reliable to disregard social norms and trends. They’re likely to reject theconsumerist and status-oriented values of their culture in favor of a life ofsimplicity. They have little interest in watching the latest popular televisionshows, acquiring the latest gadgets or goods, or trying to impress people withtheir appearance, their status, or their sophistication. They may shock otherswith their unconventionality and their willingness to contradict consensusopinions.There’s a connection here with awakened individuals’ lack of group identity andtheir sense of inner security. Many people are reluctant to break culturalexpectations because they’re afraid of losing status or being rejected by theirpeers. Their need for belonging is stronger than their need for autonomy. Butfor awakened individuals, this relationship is reversed — it’s important forthem to follow their own impulses and intuitions, even if this means beingdisliked. It’s more important for them to be true to themselves than to beaccepted. As one person told me, “I feel like I have more courage to do what Ibelieve in now.”Enhanced, More Authentic RelationshipsIn some cases, friends and relatives resent shifters’ new authentic way ofliving and misinterpret it as selfishness. In chapter 10[part0017.html#G6PI0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5] we saw that thiscontributes to relationship problems that can occur after awakening. In general,though, awakened individuals feel that their relationships deepen and becomemore fulfilling. The authenticity of their lifestyle also expresses itself inmore authentic relationships.Relationships deepen for awakened people partly due to their increased empathyand compassion, which means that they become more tolerant and understanding andless judgmental. For example, Helen told me that her relationships have improvedbecause she has “a lot more compassion and understanding. If people are behavingin a certain way, I’m aware that there are reasons why they are like that.”Similarly, a person described how her relationships have improved because “I ammore tolerant and less judgmental of other people.” As a result, awakenedindividuals are less likely to react with hostility and animosity to others, andless likely to initiate conflict. As Graham remarked, “Things [about otherpeople] that might have annoyed me or irritated me don’t affect me at all. Ijust let it go.”The ability to be present in relationships is a factor, too. If you aren’tpresent to the people you’re with — if you’re thinking of other things, writingtexts, or reading emails while you’re talking to them — then your companionswill (rightly) feel rejected. This may lead to discord and hostility inrelationships. But if you’re fully present to people — as awakened individualsare likely to be — you create a bond of empathy that leads to mutual respect andtrust.There’s certainly a connection between deeper relationships and inner security,too. If we’re insecure, our social interactions are usually self-centered. We’reconcerned with making good impressions, saying the right things and behaving inthe right ways. We often wear social masks to try to make ourselves seem morecharming or interesting. But if we feel secure within ourselves, as awakenedindividuals do, this self-centeredness and role-playing falls away. We shift ourfocus away from ourselves and give our full attention to the people we’re with.Kelly gave me an excellent description of this shift, telling me how she used tobe “on guard, ready to defend myself against potential criticism or judgment,always self-conscious, wanting to be seen in the best possible way. . . . All ofthat stopped. I could just see people instead of focusing on what they thoughtof me.” And at the same time, the absence of role-playing enables ourrelationships to become more intimate. We’re able to reveal our deepest feelingswithout pretense, which encourages others to do the same.Characteristics at Different Intensities of WakefulnessThe intensity of a person’s wakefulness can be measured by the intensity of thecharacteristics we’ve looked at in this chapter and the previous one. Inperceptual terms, you can gauge the intensity of a person’s wakefulness by howvivid their awareness of the phenomenal world is or how present they are. Froman affective perspective, you can think in terms of the degree of well-being andcompassion they feel, how quiet their mind is, or how much they fear death. It’squite common to discuss wakefulness in these perceptual and affective terms, butthe conceptual and behavioral aspects offer an equally reliable gauge ofwakefulness. You can also think in terms of how wide a person’s sense ofperspective is, their degree of appreciation and gratitude, and whether theyhave moved beyond group identity. You can also consider how authentically theylive, how much they enjoy quietness, or how altruistic they are.Wakefulness occurs across all of these areas roughly in parallel. You can’t beawake in perceptual or affective terms without being awake in conceptual orbehavioral terms (or vice versa). Different intensities of wakefulness expressthemselves fairly evenly across the different aspects and characteristics.Consider a person who experiences a low intensity of wakefulness, for instance.They might sense that the world around them is alive and that life is somehowmeaningful without being directly aware of the all-pervading spiritual forcethat is the source of these qualities. They might experience a strong sense ofconnectedness to other beings, nature, and the world in general without actuallyfeeling one with the world or that they actually are it. While they might stillexperience a lot of thought-chatter, they may be aware of it as just a processthat they can let pass by without identifying with it. They might feel a generalsense of well-being, but one that is sometimes disturbed by degrees of anxiety,stress, or frustration.In conceptual terms, they may veer between feeling deeply appreciative ofdifferent aspects of their lives and sometimes taking them for granted. Althoughthey might generally have a universal outlook, they may sometimes loseperspective and find themselves immersed in a narrow world of personal concerns.In behavioral terms, they may feel a small degree of attachment to materialgoods or other kinds of accumulation. They may enjoy quietness and solitude, butalso sometimes find themselves getting caught up in unnecessary activity.Now let’s consider a person who experiences a high intensity of wakefulness.They can sense spirit-force pervading the whole of their surroundings and cansee the whole world as the expression or manifestation of this force. They havea quiet mind with no involuntary thought-chatter. They feel a sense of onenesswith the whole world and all things in it. They might even sense that they areall things, aware that their own being is also the manifestation of (and is alsopervaded by) spirit-force so that they are of the same essence as everythingelse. They have a constant sense of equanimous well-being, includingappreciation.In conceptual terms, the events and issues of their personal lives have littlesignificance to them — certainly less significance than social and global issuesand the suffering of others. They are completely free of the impulse toaccumulate possessions, wealth, success, or fame. They are content to be, tolive harmoniously within themselves, within the present moment, and within theworld. At the same time, they live harmoniously in union with other humanbeings, other living beings, the whole of nature, and the whole cosmos.image [../images/00006.jpeg]Toward the end of chapter 11[part0018.html#H5A40-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5] we discussed the problemof distinguishing false spiritual teachers from genuine ones, and hopefully thecharacteristics I’ve delineated over the last two chapters will help in thisregard. If a person claims to be awakened but doesn’t display all (or almostall) of these characteristics, then it’s highly likely that they are eitherself-deluded or fraudulent. A person may claim to live in a state of union withthe cosmos or in a constant state of bliss; they may claim that their mind iscompletely quiet, and that they can set other people free with their insight.But if they live an accumulative lifestyle (that is, if they have an impulse tobecome wealthy or powerful or influential as individuals), if they behaveimmorally, if they don’t radiate compassion and live altruistically, if theyseem to be wounded by slights, if they encourage a sense of group identity amongtheir followers, or if they show signs of prejudice or enmity toward othergroups — then you should treat their claims with skepticism.The Two Metacharacteristics of WakefulnessAll of these characteristics are generated by the wakeful self-system, in thesame way that the characteristics of our normal state such as ego-isolation,automatized perception, inner discord, and the need for group identity aregenerated by the self-system of sleep. This is why the characteristics are soclosely linked — they’re all related to the same underlying factors. They canall be traced back to the same fundamental aspects of the wakeful self-system.One way to look at this is in terms of metacharacteristics; that is, fundamentalfeatures of the wakeful self-system that generate a wide variety of othercharacteristics. These fundamental features appear directly as characteristicsthemselves at the same time as generate other characteristics.In my view, there are two metacharacteristics — fundamental features — of thewakeful self-system. The first, and most important, is its lack of boundaries,its fluid openness, which generates connection rather than separation, lack, andvulnerability. In addition to being a characteristic in itself, thistranscendence of ego-isolation is closely linked to many other characteristics:increased empathy and compassion, inner security, and stability; loss of fear ofdeath and the need for group identity; universal outlook, altruism; andnonaccumulative lifestyle. All of these characteristics are related to somedegree to either an increased sense of connection or a falling away of theseparate ego’s need to be strengthened or supported.The second metacharacteristic is the inner quietness of the wakeful system. Thisis strongly linked to the perpetual aspects of wakefulness. Withoutthought-chatter, our perception becomes more direct and infused with energy. Wealso become much more present, which enables us to attend more fully to theworld around us. Inner quietness is also strongly linked to the ability to be,to enjoy quietness and inactivity. It’s almost impossible for us to do nothingwhile our minds are full of thought-chatter. We feel an impulse to immerse ourattention in distractions or activities in order to escape the discord insideus.These two metacharacteristics obviously connect with each other. Inner quietnessis partly the result of the transcendence of separation, becauseego-separateness encourages self-absorption and self-reflection. At the sametime, the transcendence of separation is partly the result of inner quietness,because constant thought-chatter reinforces our sense of ego andself-boundaries.Several characteristics of wakefulness are linked to both of thesemetacharacteristics, combining their effects. For example, well-being is largelythe result of losing the anxiety and incompleteness generated byego-separateness, as well as freeing ourselves from the inner disturbance ofthought-chatter and from the negative states of mind produced by negativethought-patterns. Well-being is also the result of our connection to thespacious radiance of our deeper being, brought on by ego-transcendence. In asimilar way, altruism stems partly from the strong sense of connection andempathy generated by ego-transcendence and partly from becoming liberated fromthe self-preoccupation of our constant thought-chatter.Finally, the deautomatized perception of wakefulness is largely the result ofinner quietness but is also related to the soft boundaries — and overallsoftness and slightness — of the wakeful self-system. In our sleep state, ittakes a lot of energy to maintain the strong boundaries and structures of ournormal self-system as well as fuel its constant thought-chatter. The wakefulself-system takes much less energy to maintain, which frees up more energy forperception.The Perennial Psychology RevisitedIt’s significant that the major characteristics of wakefulness I’ve identifiedthrough my research are essentially the same as those I highlighted in chapter 2[part0009.html#8IL20-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5] as the main themes ofwakefulness as described in the world’s spiritual traditions. (If you remember,these included union, inner stillness or inner emptiness, self-sufficiency,compassion and altruism, relinquishing personal agency, heightened awareness,and well-being.) This synchronicity validates the insights of spiritualtraditions and shows that wakefulness can exist outside spiritual traditions andis more fundamental than the traditions themselves. It suggests that wakefulnessexists as a psychological or ontological state in itself. It may be interpretedin terms of spiritual traditions, but it doesn’t have to be.Theologians and transpersonal psychologists have long debated the existence of a“perennial philosophy,” a common core to the world’s religions and spiritualtraditions. According to the perennial view, the same basic truths lie behindall spiritual teachings but they’re expressed in slightly different ways.They’re simply different paths leading toward the peak of the same mountain,though there are some superficial differences between them, of course.On the other hand, some people dispute the existence of a perennial philosophy,believing instead that spiritual and mystical traditions are independent. Thereisn’t a common mountain — all the paths are heading in different directionstoward different peaks. Any similarities between different traditions are theresult of contact or influence. For example, the teachings of the ancient IndianUpanishads are similar to those of the medieval Christian mystic MeisterEckhart. Meister Eckhart’s concept of the Godhead is similar to the Upanishads’concept of brahman. His view that at the deepest part of the soul human beingsare one with God is similar to the Upanishadic idea that atman is one withbrahman. This might seem to suggest that the Upanishadic sages and MeisterEckhart explored the same essential depths (or heights) of the human soul andsimply explained their experience in terms of their own cultural references.However, a nonperennialist would point to evidence that Upanishadic teachers hadcontact with Greek travelers, through which their teachings may have influencedGreek Neoplatonist philosophers (such as Plotinus, whose teachings also havesimilarities to those of the Upanishads). And in turn, Christian mystics likeMeister Eckhart were influenced by the Neoplatonist philosophers.This seems highly implausible to me. For one thing, even if there was a chain ofinfluence in the way this argument suggests, surely the original teachings wouldhave been altered beyond recognition over centuries of dissipation (similar to agame of telephone), rather than remaining essentially the same. But the best wayof verifying perennialism is to look outside spiritual traditions, as we’ve donein this book. Most of the participants of my research had no familiarity withspiritual traditions or practices at the time of their awakenings, but stilldescribed them in similar terms to the mystics of many different traditions.(Some of them became familiar with traditions later — in some cases, many yearslater; in other cases, only to a limited degree.) This strongly suggests thatthere exists some form of underlying or perennial landscape of experience thatprecedes interpretation by spiritual traditions.Nonperennialists usually see spiritual experiences as being constructed by thebeliefs and concepts of different traditions, but this obviously can’t be thecase when they happen to people who have no knowledge of these traditions. Thesame argument applies to temporary awakening experiences, which often occuroutside the context of spiritual traditions and practices, to people who have noknowledge of them. (According to my research, the most common triggers ofawakening experiences are psychological turmoil, contact with nature,meditation, and watching or listening to an arts performance.6[part0027.html#rch13en6]) It also applies to children’s awakening experiences.Research shows that children can have awakening experiences as early as threeyears old, although they are most common between the ages of five and fifteen.7[part0027.html#rch13en7] This obviously can’t be explained in terms of culturalinfluence. Children can’t construct awakening experiences before they’rementally capable of absorbing the concepts and beliefs of their culture.Wakefulness has been real and accessible for all human beings at all times andin all cultures. People from all cultures have been able to touch into it andexplore its rich and radiant experiential landscape. They have simplyinterpreted and conceptualized it in slightly different ways, due to thedifferent beliefs and conventions of their cultures. In Buddhism, perhapsbecause of Indian culture’s belief in rebirth, wakefulness is partly conceivedas a state in which a person no longer generates karma and no longer needs to bereborn. But when expressed through the more dynamic and world-embracingattitudes of early Chinese culture, wakefulness is partly conceived as a processof becoming attuned to the Dao and living in harmony with it. On the other hand,people who live in monotheistic cultures — Jewish, Sufi, and Christian cultures— see wakefulness in more transcendent terms. To them, it’s natural to interpretthe all-pervading spirit-force (which the Chinese conceive as the Dao and theIndians as brahman) in terms of God. They see it as divine energy, the being ofGod, and they conceive the goal of their development to be union with God.In some respects, modern-day spiritual seekers are in a better position. In oursecular culture we’re less obliged to interpret wakefulness through the prism ofreligious or metaphysical frameworks. It’s naive to think that there’s such athing as pure experience — some degree of interpretation will always take place.No phenomenon exists outside the culture in which it develops, and no phenomenonis free from cultural influence. But there are degrees of interpretation. Whenwe look at wakefulness outside spiritual traditions, we’re surely looking at itin a purer form, before added layers of interpretation. You could say that we’relooking at the raw materials, before they go through the filtering andmanufacturing processes of spiritual and religious traditions.8[part0027.html#rch13en8]The Wakeful Vision of the WorldThe two previous chapters make clear that awakened individuals literally live ina different world from that of other people.In our normal sleep state, we tend to assume that we’re seeing the world as itis, and that our view of life is objective and true. This is the basicassumption that underpins modern materialistic science, which is basically aparadigm of reality derived from the sleep state. According to this paradigm,matter is the only reality, and all phenomena can be explained in terms of theactions and interactions of matter. Consciousness can be explained in terms ofbrain activity (or as a cognitive illusion), evolution can be explained in termsof random mutations and natural selection, and all human behavior can beexplained in terms of genetics and neuroscience. The world is a fundamentallyinanimate place, and we’re nothing more than biological machines. It’simpossible to conceive of any form of life after death because our seemingidentity and consciousness are just products of brain activity. When the braindies, our consciousness disappears into nothingness, like the pictures on atelevision screen when the set is switched off. This worldview is aphilosophical projection of the sleep state. And inevitably, when people makevalue judgments based on this worldview, these tend to be very bleak — forexample, that the universe is fundamentally without purpose or direction, thatlife is fundamentally meaningless, that human beings are essentially selfish,and so on.These value judgments are similar to those of existentialist philosophy, whichwas another projection of the sleep state. According to existentialism, there’sno meaning to life except that which we create through our own choices andactions. In itself, life is meaningless and absurd, and the world — and allother human beings — exists in otherness to us. The world is fundamentally emptyand indifferent to us, but unfortunately we’re stranded in it until death (theultimate absurdity) returns us to nothingness.In some ways existentialist philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre and AlbertCamus — and some modern materialistic scientists and philosophers — were (andare) insightful and wise, so it’s strange that they never questioned theobjectivity of their vision of the world. It never seemed to occur to them thatthe worldview that they believed was self-evidently true was just a perspectiveon reality, produced by their own particular state of being. It didn’t seem tooccur to them that from a different perspective, and in a different state ofbeing, the world would appear a completely different place.But the wakeful state tells us that the world is not an inanimate place, thatmatter is not the only reality, that life is not meaningless or purposeless, andthat the universe is not indifferent to us. It tells us that consciousness isnot just produced by the brain but is a fundamental quality of the universe thatchannels into our own individual beings. It tells us that we are not isolatedindividuals but share the same spiritual essence as every other living being,every object, and the whole universe itself. It reveals to us that there ismeaning to life — a meaning that can’t necessarily be explained (at least notdirectly) but that can certainly be sensed. We can look above us at the sky andsense something benevolent in it, a harmonious atmosphere. We can walk outsideand sense a kind of meaning filling the landscape around us, emanating from thetrees and fields. We can sense it flowing between us and other people, as aradiant connectedness, a sense of warmth and love. We can sense it inside us, asthe radiant, blissful nature of our deepest being. Wakefulness reveals to usthat the fundamental nature of reality is harmony, meaning, and love.But hold on, isn’t the wakeful vision of the world just a different perspective,which has no more validity than the sleep perspective? How can one perspectivebe truer than another?The important point here is that the worldview of wakefulness is based on a moreintense awareness of reality. It comes from an opening and an expansion ofawareness, and a falling away of the mechanisms that normally restrict or diluteour awareness. It stems from an intensification of perceptual awareness, in thesense that the world around us becomes more vivid and real, and an expansion ofconceptual awareness, in the sense that our perspective becomes wider and moreuniversal. The worldview of the wakeful state is therefore more valid in thesame way that a detailed, panoramic view of a landscape is truer than a blurredview through a narrow perspective."},{"pageContent":"14. The Natural Wakefulness of Children [part0005.html#rch14]Throughout this book, I’ve portrayed wakefulness as a higher state that isbecoming increasingly common but that is still fairly unusual. We’ve seen thatsome people shift into wakefulness after intense psychological turmoil and thatothers develop it gradually, over years of following spiritual practices andpaths. But perhaps in a sense we’ve all known wakefulness, even if we spend ourwhole adult lives asleep.Is it possible that as children we experience a form of natural wakefulness thatwe lose as we grow into adults? And when we attain wakefulness as adults —either accidentally or through spiritual practice — are we effectively regainingour natural childhood state? Is spiritual development a matter of turning fullcircle and regaining something that we’ve lost?This suggests that childhood is a time of heightened spiritual sensibility,intense awareness, and natural joy. William Wordsworth certainly portrayschildhood in this way in his poem “Intimations of Immortality,” describing how“heaven lies about us in our infancy!” and how, as we grow into adulthood,“Shades of the prison-house begin to close” and the world begins to “fade intothe light of common day.”1 [part0027.html#rch14en1] Similarly, theseventeenth-century poet Thomas Traherne famously describes his childhood as atime when the world appeared “inexpressibly rare and delightful and beautiful. .. . The green trees when I saw them first through one of the gates transportedand ravished me, their sweetness and unusual beauty made my heart to leap, andalmost mad with ecstasy, they were such strange and wonderful things.”2[part0027.html#rch14en2]Some spiritual traditions also associate childhood with wakefulness and seespiritual development as a matter of recovering qualities of our childhoodstate. As we saw in chapter 2[part0009.html#8IL20-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5], the Dao De Jing advisesus to “return to the state of the infant,” and says that the person who “has inhimself abundantly the attributes (of the Dao) is like an infant.”3[part0027.html#rch14en3] In Daoism, one of the aims of spiritual development isto recapture a childlike spontaneity, curiosity, openness, and natural harmonywith the Dao. One of Jesus’s most famous sayings is “unless you change andbecome like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.”4[part0027.html#rch14en4] One interpretation of this passage is that the phrase“kingdom of heaven” refers to the wonder and well-being of spiritualwakefulness.But perhaps we’re idealizing the childhood state. The philosopher Ken Wilber,for example, believes that children can’t experience genuine spiritual statesbecause they’re at a “pre-egoic” stage of development. We have to develop an egobefore we can gain access to transpersonal or spiritual states, which isobviously only possible for adults. Wilber admits that there are somesimilarities between the infant state and the awakened state. For example, eachlacks an ego-boundary, which means there’s no sense of separation between theself and the environment. But, as he sees it, this is not equivalent to thestate of union with the cosmos experienced by mystics. You can’t transcendseparation without first developing a separate self. Otherwise there’s just“de-differentiation,” an immersion in a foggy soup of unconscious experience,which is not the same as union.5 [part0027.html#rch14en5]However, Wilber’s model, in my view, is a little too linear and hierarchical.Wakefulness doesn’t just lie on the other side of our normal adult state, likethe higher ranges of a mountain. It can be accessed at earlier stages ofdevelopment, too, although it might manifest itself in different ways.The wakeful state is paradoxical. In some ways wakefulness is extraordinary, inthat the world becomes awe-inspiringly real and beautiful, and life becomes awonderful adventure. At the same time, wakefulness seems perfectly ordinary. Itdoesn’t seem out of this world but rather more of this world. It seems naturaland easy, as if we have returned home to a place where we feel completelycomfortable. We think, “Of course, this is how things are meant to be!”Wakefulness means connecting to the most fundamental, intrinsic part of ourbeing — our spirit-essence, which is also the essence of everything else thatexists — which is one reason it feels so natural and ordinary. But perhapsanother reason is because we have already touched into wakefulness in thislifetime, as young children. Wakefulness is the place where we began, which weslipped away from when our adult egos developed. And it’s the place we return towhen we wake up as adults, the place we return to in a deeper and moreintegrated way.Childhood Awakening ExperiencesTemporary awakening experiences are certainly common during childhood — probablymore common than in adulthood. (As I noted toward the end of the previouschapter, this is one of the main arguments in favor of a “perennialphilosophy.”) One study found that experiences of the “numinous” were common inchildren under age seven (becoming less frequent in older children),6[part0027.html#rch14en6] while another study found that about half of a group ofteenagers could recall having experiences of “nature mysticism” similar to thosedescribed by Wordsworth.7 [part0027.html#rch14en7]I’ve never specifically studied childhood awakening experiences, which is why inthis chapter I mostly rely on other sources, but I have been sent some reportsof them. For example, Nicky described an awakening experience that occurred atthe age of eleven, when she was singing in a church choir. She entered a“euphoric blissful state, feeling merged with the universe. . . . The worldappeared to have a golden hue and all colours were intense, vivid, jewel-like.”Similarly, Joe, now in his fifties, recalled a very intense awakening experiencethat occurred just after he started school, at around the age of four:I came bounding out of my front door into the street [and] said to myself, “Ijust don’t believe that I’m really here! Where did I come from? How did I gethere?” No sooner had I thought this when everything just melted. I looked at thetelegraph pole outside of my friend’s house, four doors up — it was justpulsating with life and energy. The road surface was the same. I looked tomyself — I was made up of the same pulsating energy. Time just melted as well.What came to me was that everything was just unreal, an illusion. I just sawthrough everything. . . .I carried on my way up to the local field, lay down, looked up to the sky andthen just felt the oneness of everything, felt the Earth spinning in its orbit.I knew the Earth. I melted into the ground, though [now] everything looked as itwould through normal vision except for the aliveness and brightness and newnessof everything. I seemed to understand or know that everything is freshly createdin every moment. There was no me. I just started laughing — surely everyone mustknow this? Why was everyone pretending?This state of consciousness lingered for a few days, but Joe made the mistake oftelling his parents about it. Inevitably, they didn’t understand and took him tosee a doctor. The doctor referred him to a child psychologist, and, tragically,Joe ended up being put on medication. (A graphic illustration of how easilywakefulness can be pathologized!) Nevertheless, Joe experienced other strangestates of consciousness as a teenager, including frequent out-of-bodyexperiences, and by then he had “learned to keep quiet, of course.”But in addition to regularly having high-intensity awakening experiences,children experience a form of wakefulness as a stable, ongoing state.The Perceptual Wakefulness of ChildrenThe most obvious way in which children are awake is in a perceptual sense. Theintense perception and heightened awareness of the wakeful state is normal forthem — especially for young children. You might be able to remember this fromyour own early childhood — how bright and colorful the world around you seemed,and how even mundane objects seemed to be imbued with richness and strangeness.I had an interesting experience a couple of years ago when my mother broughtsome of my old childhood toys down from the loft so that my own kids could playwith them. She brought down a box of building blocks, a couple of my old cuddlytoys, and some of my old books and football magazines. I had no idea she hadkept them; I hadn’t seen them for thirty years or more. As I examined them I wasimmediately plunged back into the miraculous world of early childhood. I wasseven or eight years old again, experiencing these objects exactly as I didthen.It’s almost impossible to convey how powerfully vivid and exciting they seemedto me. The magazines looked fairly tacky and slipshod by modern standards, but Ifelt exhilarated by them, by the richness, brightness, and contrast of thecolors and graphics. And when I picked up my old building blocks I reexperiencedexactly how fascinating and attractive they seemed when I was a child. Theyseemed amazing in their smooth shininess, the perfect regularity of theirshapes, and the radiance of their colors. I remembered exactly how wonderfullyexciting it was to put the pieces together and build houses, cars, and otherstructures.I wasn’t just experiencing a nostalgic reminiscence of my childhood; I wasactually experiencing the toys as I did back then. I think I have some degree ofperceptual wakefulness all the time — I’m often struck by the beauty,strangeness, and vividness of the phenomena around me. But it was quite a shockto realize how much more perceptually awake I was as a young child.If you spend time around young children (and particularly if you have childrenof your own) you’ve probably noticed this intensity of perception in them, too.I remember being especially struck by this with our first child, Hugh (who isthirteen years old at the time of writing). He had a very poetic way ofexpressing his perceptions. Once we were walking to his nursery on a rainy day,and the rain was dripping down the drainpipes of the houses and then bouncing upoff the ground. “Look, Daddy,” he said, “the rain is dancing!” A few monthslater, in the summer, we were in the garden and there was a book on the grasswith its pages blowing open in the wind. “Look, Daddy,” he said, “the wind isreading your book!”When Hugh started walking I was amazed at how long it took us to walk anywhere —not just because he walked slowly, but also because he continually stopped toexamine everything around him. We would walk to the local post office, along apath by the edge of a golf course, and what should have been a ten-minute walktook about a half hour. He would stop to look at — or to pick up — trees,bushes, stones, leaves, puddles, even discarded crisp packets and soda cans.Everything was a source of fascination.This is one of the great things about being around young children — if we’veforgotten, they can remind us of the wonder of being, the joy of payingattention to small things, the joy of taking time to stop and look rather thanjust rushing like an arrow to our destinations with our minds immersed inthought-chatter. Young children can rekindle perceptual wakefulness in us. Ineffect, by spending time with children we can become children ourselves again.We see the world through their eyes.As I note in Waking from Sleep, books such as Edward Robinson’s The OriginalVision and Edward Hoffman’s Visions of Innocence contain many accounts of adultswho describe their childhoods as times of intense, clear awareness, with a senseof wonder at the strangeness and aliveness of their surroundings and a sensethat the world is a harmonious and benevolent place. Alison Gopnik, one of theworld’s leading developmental psychologists, suggests that babies are “actuallyaware of much more, much more intensely, than we are.”8 [part0027.html#rch14en8]She draws a parallel between the child’s intense perception and the “sense ofwonder” that motivates poets and scientists and that we adults occasionallyexperience through travel or meditation. As she writes, “Travel, meditation, andRomantic poetry can give us an empathetic first-person taste of infantexperience.”9 [part0027.html#rch14en9] Gopnik uses the term lanternconsciousness to describe babies’ and young children’s awareness — a “vividpanoramic illumination of the everyday,” which she recognizes as similar to the“exultation and ecstasy” of some religious and aesthetic experiences.10[part0027.html#rch14en10]I’ve already suggested the reason for children’s intense perception. Childrenare free of the automatized perception we experience as adults, which isnecessary to redirect our powerful ego-driven self-system. That strongself-system hasn’t developed yet, so young children’s perception is alwayspowerful and direct. They are continuously open to the is-ness and richness andstrangeness of the world, which we adults only rarely glimpse (as Alison Gopniksuggests).It’s also significant that children aren’t immersed in thought-chatter in theway that adults are. They don’t have a sense of being separate; they don’t talkto themselves inside their own mental space. As a result, they live in the worldmuch more than adults, with a more direct and immediate relationship to theirexperiences. You could say that young children have a natural state of presence.Wherever they are and whatever they’re doing, they’re always intensely there,giving themselves wholly to the reality of their moment-to-moment experience.Other CharacteristicsChildren are certainly awake in other ways as well, most obviously in terms oftheir natural sense of well-being. As every parent knows, children can be veryturbulent emotionally. Particularly during what psychologists call the impulsivestage, children experience discontent frequently, when their needs aren’tsatisfied or their desires are frustrated. Tragically, some children may becometraumatized by abuse from their caregivers and become withdrawn or disturbed asa result. But in general, children radiate a powerful joie de vivre, aninfectious positivity, a sense of exhilaration at being alive.This is partly because children are free of the discord and negativity createdby thought-chatter, including the negative cognitive scripts that we develop asadults (which often generate feelings of depression, low self-esteem, andbitterness or resentment). But probably the main reason for children’swell-being is that the slightness — and the weak boundaries — of theirself-system means that they are always connected to the radiance of their entirebeing.As I suggested earlier, our being in its essence is an influx of the spiritualenergy of the universe. Our individual spirit is one with the spirit of theuniverse in the same way that an inlet or estuary is one with the sea. Inadulthood, our self-system (with the ego at its center) becomes so strong andboundaried that we become alienated from this spirit source and so loseconnection with that radiant energy. (In the analogy I used in chapter 1[part0008.html#7K4G0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5], this is like a citybecoming a separate entity from the landscape around it, and losing itsconnection to nature.) But young children haven’t lost connection to theirspirit source. Their spirit is not separated from their self. As a result, theyexist in a state of pure being. They can always sense the energy of being — withits natural quality of well-being — flowing through them. The mature wakefulstate brings exactly the same sense of radiant well-being. When our self-systembecomes softer and more integrated with our whole being, we feel connected tospirit again.A child’s lack of a strong, boundaried self-system generates another importantaspect of wakefulness: a strong sense of connection to the world around them.Young children don’t have the sense of being “in here” — mental entities livinginside our bodies — and looking “out there” at a world. They don’t observe theworld from a distance, but rather participate in it with no division betweenthem and their experience. For example, in The Original Vision, EdwardRobinson’s study of childhood spiritual experiences, one person recalls howduring their childhood, “Plants and animals radiated an aura of aliveness, and Ioften felt that I was simply part of a great Whole.”11 [part0027.html#rch14en11]Another person describes how, at the age of around three, they felt “a euphoricunification with the space in front of me and all around.”12[part0027.html#rch14en12]Children certainly also experience heightened energy, as any parent who tries tokeep up with their play for any length of time will tell you. Children’s amazingenergy is one of the most striking things about them. An incredible vitalitystreams through them from the moment they bounce out of bed in the morning tothe moment they go to bed. And they have a dynamic creativity that enables themto invent endless games and imaginary worlds of play. (Once when I was talkingabout this in a lecture, a member of the audience asked, “If children are soenergetic, why do they have to sleep so much?” “That’s probably an evolutionaryadaptation,” I joked. “Otherwise parents wouldn’t be able to cope and therewould be nobody to take care of them.”) As we saw in chapter 8[part0015.html#E9OE0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5], this amazing vitality isreferred to in Indian Tantric philosophy as pranotthana, a state of uplifted orintensified life-energy that we recapture through spiritual development.The reason for this vitality is obvious: children haven’t developed the adultself-system yet, which monopolizes so much of the energy of our being. And whenin mature wakefulness a new, much less energy-intensive self-system isestablished, we recapture some of the amazing vitality and the dynamiccreativity we had as children. This is one sense in which wakefulness meansturning a full circle and recapturing what we’ve lost.The childhood state includes some of the conceptual and behavioralcharacteristics of wakefulness, too. Most obviously, children don’t have theneed to accumulate, which is such a strong feature of our sleep state. Childrenlove playing with toys and receiving presents, but they don’t strive toaccumulate possessions just for their own sake. They don’t strive to accumulatewealth, just as they don’t strive to gain power, status, or success. Neither dothey attach themselves to their appearance and strive to gain significancethrough their achievements. They don’t need to accumulate or attach themselvesto anything because they don’t experience the sense of separateness andincompleteness that gives rise to these impulses.Their lack of ego-separateness also means that children don’t have a need forgroup identity. Young children have no sense of religious or ethnic identity. Ilive in an ethnically diverse area in a big city (Manchester, in the UK). Mykids have always had friends from different ethnic groups, without any notionthat they were different from them in any way. They sometimes used theirfriends’ different skin colors as a way of describing them (“Do you mean the boywith brown skin?”) but — to paraphrase a Bob Marley song — this is of no moresignificance than the color of their friends’ eyes.As children grow up, adults try hard to inculcate a sense of group identity inthem. They induct children into their religions, teach them the history of their“people,” teach them to follow their conventions and codes of behavior, pass ontheir beliefs and perhaps a sense of prejudice or enmity toward other groups.Finally, children are convinced that they are Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, American,British, etc., and therefore distinct from other people who belong to differentgroups. (I describe this process of taking on identity in my poetic piece “ThePrimal Soul” in The Calm Center.)Higher-Intensity Awakening ExperiencesIf children exist in a natural state of wakefulness, why do they have awakeningexperiences? Surely only people who are asleep can have temporary awakeningexperiences. If they are already awake, there’s nothing for them to wake upfrom.But it’s a question of degrees. As we’ve seen, wakefulness has many gradations.People whose normal level of wakefulness is, say, a low or medium intensity canoccasionally shift up to a higher intensity of wakefulness. Awakened individualscan still have awakening experiences, although it may be more accurate to referto them as experiences of more intense wakefulness. Even if you’re awake, youcan still become more awake.This is certainly the case with children. Children’s awakening experiencesappear to be generally more intense than adults’ experiences. Children arebeginning from a higher baseline, so to speak, and so have easier access to thehighest intensities of wakefulness, just as climbers at the base camp of MountEverest have easier access to its higher points than people at sea level. Likethe two experiences from my own files above, childhood awakening experiences areoften high-intensity experiences of union and fusion rather than, for example,low-intensity experiences of the vividness of one’s surroundings, or a sense ofharmony and well-being. Children already experience this vividness and harmony,so to them it’s not a form of awakening.The works of Edward Robinson and Edward Hoffman contain many examples of suchexperiences. At the age of three, one person had an experience in which theybecame “part of the flowers, and stones, and dusty earth. I could feel thedandelions pulsating in the sunlight, and experienced a timeless unity with alllife.”13 [part0027.html#rch14en13] Another person described a feeling of being“part of a world of meaning, unrestricted by space/time.”14[part0027.html#rch14en14] While at an even higher intensity of wakefulness, aperson described a childhood experience of actually becoming everything: “A dooropened, and I became the sun, the wind, and the sea. There was no ‘I’ anymore.‘I’ had merged with everything else. All sensory perceptions had become one.Sound, smell, taste, touch, shape — all melted into a brilliant light. Thepulsating energy went through me, and I was part of this energy.”15[part0027.html#rch14en15]Differences between Mature and Immature WakefulnessAt the same time, there are clearly aspects of the mature wakeful state thatchildren don’t share.Psychologists used to assume that young children couldn’t be empathic oraltruistic. The famous developmental psychologist Jean Piaget believed thatchildren were unable to see the world from any point of view apart from theirown and so were unable to empathize with other people. In a similar way, thepsychologist Lawrence Kohlberg believed that children’s sense of morality was“pre-conventional.” That is, children have no concern for what is right orwrong, or for social rules or laws; their only motivation to behave morally isto avoid punishment or gain reward. In other words, both Piaget and Kohlberg sawchildren as amoral, in the sense that they are self-centered and unable to takethe feelings of others into consideration or sense the effects of their actionson others.But more recent research contradicts these views. Studies have shown that,almost from birth, children have the ability to identify with other people andtake on other people’s feelings. At the age of one, babies are able to tell thedifference between actions that are done intentionally or unintentionally, andto view situations from the perspective of others. If a fourteen-month-old babyis encouraged to pick some food to offer to other people, they will assume thatothers like the same food they do and choose that. But by eighteen months old, ababy recognizes that other people may have different preferences and will pickdifferent food for them. This certainly shows an ability to identify with otherpeople.16 [part0027.html#rch14en16]One-year-old babies are also capable of acting altruistically. Studies haveshown that fourteen-month-old babies will go out of their way to pick up objectsfor other people, if they see them straining to reach them. If a person aroundthem is in distress, they become upset themselves and try to comfort and consolethe person by kissing and petting.17 [part0027.html#rch14en17] As Alison Gopnikputs it, “Tiny babies recognize that their fear and sadness is your fear andsadness and that their joy is your joy. Even more profoundly, very youngchildren feel that they should alleviate the fear and sadness of others, andhelp them get what they want.”18 [part0027.html#rch14en18]Nevertheless, although Piaget and Kohlberg were wrong, it would be misleading tosuggest that children are empathic or altruistic to the same high degree asmaturely awakened people. Because of their powerful impulses and desires, youngchildren have a tendency to behave selfishly, and their ability to empathize isoften overridden by their selfish impulses. To a young child who has decidedthey want an ice cream or feels aggrieved because they want to stay up and playinstead of go to bed, nothing else matters apart from their desires. Thestrength of their impulses overrides any concern for others — including theirstressed-out parents — or any rational notion of fairness.Another important difference is that children aren’t capable of theall-embracing compassion of mature wakefulness and the active idealism it oftengives rise to. Children don’t have a sense of identification with the wholehuman race, the urge to make the world a better place, or a general impulse toalleviate the sufferings of their fellow human beings. When they are altruistic,it’s in response to specific situations, whereas the altruism of maturewakefulness is often spontaneous and unconditional.This points to another way in which childhood wakefulness is different frommature wakefulness. Conceptually, children don’t have the expansive outlook ofthe mature wakeful state. They don’t have a sense of the whole world stretchingaround them, with an awareness of the predicaments of other human beings. Theyhave little awareness of reality beyond their immediate, everyday worlds.Another difference is that children don’t — or at least, only rarely —experience the inner quietness of mature wakefulness. Children live in an almostconstant state of extroversion, absorbed in their play, their interactions withother people, or in the events taking place around them. They rarely experienceinner quietness, simply because they rarely experience inwardness.19[part0027.html#rch14en19]And finally, children don’t experience the inner security and stability of themature wakeful state. Their impulsive emotionality means that they can often bewildly unstable (especially if they are tired), swinging from elation to angeror upset at the drop of a hat. Children are certainly not “the same in pleasureand pain” (as the Bhagavad Gita advises us to be) or “never humiliated or upsetby others” (as the Buddhist Heart Sutra suggests) — as anyone who has witnessedtheir child screaming because they don’t like their dinner, or because theirbrother or sister has teased them, can attest.Wakefulness, Before and After the Self-SystemSo what we see in children is a different kind of wakefulness, a kind of primalor immature wakefulness, which is mainly oriented toward perceptual andaffective characteristics. Children are certainly awake but not in the same wayas adults can be. Essentially, their wakefulness is one that comes before ourself-system has developed or, more strictly speaking, as it’s developing. Maturewakefulness comes after our self-system has developed. In fact, you could saythat the reason why children experience some aspects of wakefulness is also thereason why they don’t experience other aspects: they don’t have a stable,well-developed self-system. They experience intense perception and energy andwell-being because they lack a fully developed self-system; they don’t have asense of inner security and stability, and can’t develop a wide perspective or auniversal outlook for the same reason.This illustrates that, although our normal self-system is the main obstacle towakefulness (and the reason why we spend our lives asleep), we can’t be awake,in a mature sense, without some form of self-system. We need some kind ofself-system as an organizational center, to perform psychological functions andmediate between us and the world. Without any kind of self-system, we would beunable to function in the world and dependent on the care and guidance ofothers, as are babies and young children. We would be unable to perform thelogical, intellectual, and practical tasks that adults take for granted; unableto make plans or decisions; unable to control our impulses; and so on. Thewakeful self-system does all of these things for us.This might remind you of the discussion on psychosis and wakefulness in chapter10 [part0017.html#G6PI0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5], where I suggestedthat the lack of a stable self-system is the main difference between psychosisand wakefulness. But this doesn’t mean that the childhood state is equivalent topsychosis. In psychosis, our self-system has broken down; it’s chaotic anddisrupted. This is not the same as an absence of a self-system or one that isdeveloping.It’s also important to realize that the immature wakefulness of childhood can beexperienced by adults, too. If awakened adults lose the ability to control theirimpulses and become excessively self-centered, they may effectively regress to achildlike state. In fact, we’ve already encountered some examples of this inchapter 11 [part0018.html#H5A40-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5]: spiritualteachers who become narcissistic and megalomaniacal as a result of the power andtemptations of their positions and the projections of their followers.Sometimes, when I discuss childhood wakefulness in talks or lectures, I jokethat children are a combination of enlightened beings and narcissistic monsters,then ask, “But isn’t that a good description of some spiritual teachers?”The Fall into AdulthoodJust as we went through a “fall” as a species, losing the natural wakefulness ofearlier human beings, all of us go through a “fall” as individuals, when we losethe primal wakefulness of children. As we move toward later childhood andadolescence, the self-system of sleep gradually forms within our being. This ispart of our developmental blueprint, our established pattern of mentaldevelopment, that unfolds as we grow into adulthood. We gradually lose theheightened awareness of children as our ego becomes more powerful andenergy-consuming and as, in response to this, our perception becomesautomatized. As a result, the world that was once so full of wonder and beautybecomes a more mundane place. We gradually lose our sense of connection to theworld — and our sense of participating in it — as the boundaries of ourself-system become established. We gradually lose our sense of well-being as webecome disconnected to the radiant life-energy of our essential being. AsWilliam Wordsworth describes it, the “shades of the prison-house begin to close”until eventually the divine vision of childhood disappears: The Man perceives it die away, And fade into the light of common day.20 [part0027.html#rch14en20]The loss of childhood wakefulness is one of the reasons why adolescence can besuch a difficult and turbulent time. Adolescence is the time of the individual“fall.” After years of carefree well-being and wholeness, adolescents begin toexperience themselves as separate entities, enclosed within their own mentalspace, with the discord of self-reflective thought-chatter constantly spinningthrough their consciousness. After years of feeling that they were part of theworld, they have a new identity as an ego. And because of its separateness, thisego feels a tremendous sense of vulnerability and fragility.This ego development is the reason why so many adolescents have identity crisesand feel such a strong need to belong, to fit in — they join gangs, followfashion trends and pop groups, or join organized religions (adolescence is apeak time for religious conversion). It’s extremely important for adolescents tofeel that they’re accepted, part of a group, with an identity as a member ofthat group, to try to overcome their sense of vulnerability. Because of theirweak inner security, adolescents can be devastated if they’re not accepted bytheir peers, or if they feel they’ve been disrespected.This state of ego-separation and inner discord can be traumatic, especiallyafter the ease and spontaneity of childhood. You could compare it to anagricultural worker who is used to the open air and the beauty of nature aroundhim but is forced to head to the city to get a job, and now spends his days in acrowded, noisy, and stuffy factory.But, of course, there are positive aspects to this as well, just as there aresome positive aspects to the “fall” we underwent as a species. In both cases,the “fall” is also a “rise,” to some extent. It would be impossible to remain ina childlike state for our whole lives. We have to be able to function in theworld on a practical basis and develop the abilities to think conceptually andabstractly. The adult self-system enables us to do this. In addition to itsnegative aspects, the adult self-system gives us the benefits of conceptualknowledge, self-reflection, impulse control, exercise of our will,organizational skills, decision-making abilities, planning skills, and thecapacity to manipulate our surroundings and live autonomously. It’s preciselybecause they lack a fully developed self-system that children are unable to dealwith the practical demands of life and need such intense nurturing.The adult self-system is undoubtedly a massive developmental progression. It’sjust unfortunate that this self-system has such negative aspects; at the sametime as being beneficial, it’s also extremely aberrational.However, this state of carefree wholeness and exhilarating aliveness isn’t lostto us forever. Through gradual spiritual development, or sudden awakening, weregain the primal wakefulness of children in a more mature form. We regainchildren’s heightened awareness and energy, and their sense of connection andwell-being, but with a stable self-system that engenders other aspects ofwakefulness. At the same time — crucially — this self-system allows us to retainthe intellectual, volitional, self-reflective, and organizational abilities ofthe normal adult state.Mature wakefulness is an integration of the childhood and the normal adultstate, retaining the benefits of both."},{"pageContent":"15. Demythologizing Wakefulness [part0005.html#rch15]At the beginning of this book, I wrote that one of my aims was to clarifyexactly what wakefulness means and dispel some of the confusion that surroundsit. This confusion has arisen partly because wakefulness has been interpreted inso many different ways, by different traditions and different teachers. Suchvariance makes it difficult to see the core truths that underlie the differentinterpretations. In this book, I’ve tried to uncover these core truths by takingwakefulness outside the context of spiritual traditions and examining thepsychological or ontological landscape that precedes interpretation by thetraditions.Dispelling this confusion also involves examining some of the popularmisunderstandings that have developed about wakefulness. Through my years ofresearch, I’ve become aware of many common ideas and assumptions about the state— some of which I used to hold myself — that simply aren’t true. It’s thesemisunderstandings that I’d like to focus on in this chapter. This examinationwill also act as a summary of the book, bringing out the most salient pointswe’ve discussed over the previous fourteen chapters and the main points I’d likeyou to take away once you set the book down.In what follows, I’ll highlight some of the myths about wakefulness and thenexplain why I believe they’re false. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Myth 1: Wakefulness is exceptional and extraordinary.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is one of the biggest misconceptions about wakefulness — and one that Iused to believe myself. When I first began my research, I was amazed at how easyit was to find cases of people who had woken up. And that’s still true. I’mcontinually surprised at the large number of examples I come across — theawakened individuals I meet by chance or synchronicity and the people who writeto me or come up to me after talks to tell me that they’ve read one of myarticles and have been through (or are going through) the same experience. Inmost cases, they’re people who don’t have backgrounds in spiritual traditionsand know very little about them. They’re often ordinary people searching for anunderstanding of the remarkable shift they’ve been through. As a result, I’mcertain there are thousands of other people out there who have experienced thisshift (mostly triggered by intense psychological turmoil) and have yet to makesense of it — or even tell anyone about it, for fear of being misunderstood.As I mentioned in the previous chapter, wakefulness is also unexceptional in thesense that the experience feels so normal. People who experience wakefulness areoften surprised by how ordinary it seems, how natural and easy and right itappears. It feels utterly familiar, even if we have no recollection ofexperiencing it before. As the contemporary Christian mystic Bernadette Robertsputs it, “From the position of egoic consciousness, unitive consciousness alwaysappears to be quite supernatural, mystical or nirvanic, but once we get there,it turns out to be utterly ordinary.”1 [part0027.html#rch15en1]In fact, when we wake up, it’s our normal sleep state that seems peculiar andunnatural. Sleep seems aberrational in its discord, constrictedness, andshadowy, limited vision of reality. We realize that it’s actually a pathologicalstate that only appeared normal because it was all we knew. When we wake upthere’s a sense of returning home to the place where we were meant to be allalong. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Myth 2: It’s not possible to live in a continuous state of wakefulness. It wouldmake it impossible for us to live in the world on a day-to-day basis.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sometimes when I talk about wakefulness in lectures or public talks, people say,“This is all very well, but we can’t actually live like this. We can’t be in astate of ecstasy and union with the cosmos all the time. We’ve still got to cookmeals, pay bills, and drive the car.”To be able to experience ecstasy and union doesn’t necessarily mean that wecontinuously experience them. Awakened people still have powers ofconcentration; we can still exclude phenomena from our attention when necessaryand narrow down our attention to specific tasks. In other words, when we need tofocus on practical tasks (driving, cooking, paying bills) we’re able totemporarily filter out our intensified awareness and sense of connection byusing our concentrative abilities. The different aspects of wakefulness arealways there potentially, but they sometimes recede into the background when weneed to switch into an organizational or practical mode.This is partly a question of integration. In the initial phase after awakening,many people find it difficult to function in everyday life. They may find itdifficult to concentrate or interact with other people. They may even havedifficulty speaking, understanding concepts like time, and retaining orremembering information. But these psychological abilities return as integrationoccurs.Following integration, awakened people often remark that they find life easier,even on a practical basis. They actually find it easier to concentrate becausetheir minds are clearer; there aren’t streams of thought-chatter mingling withtheir conscious thought processes and pulling their attention away from whatthey want to think about. Their practical lives are also often less complex,because they don’t fill their days with unnecessary activities. They keep theirlives simple and do what needs to be done, efficiently and skillfully. As aresult, they’re less likely to become overwhelmed or exhausted by overactivity.Overall, it’s possible that awakened individuals actually get better at livingin the world on a day-to-day basis. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Myth 3: You are either enlightened or not.There’s no middle ground.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------There’s no clear dividing line between wakefulness and sleep. There aredifferent degrees of sleep and different degrees of wakefulness, stretchingacross a wide continuum. Some people may be more deeply asleep than others; thatis, they may have a stronger sense of separation, a more dulled perception ofthe phenomenal world, a greater identification with their thought-chatter, amore egocentric outlook, and a stronger sense of group identity. Some people maybe more intensely awake than others; that is, they may have a stronger sense ofunion or connection, a more intense perception of the phenomenal world, agreater inner quietness and stillness, a wider sense of perspective, and adeeper sense of identification with the human race as a whole. Thecharacteristics of wakefulness can express themselves at different degrees ofintensity.The idea that there’s a clear distinction between wakefulness and sleep — thateither you’re awakened or you’re not — probably stems from the sudden nature ofmost awakenings. When the shift into wakefulness occurs suddenly, it may seemthat there’s a clear-cut distinction between the two states, as if they’redifferent countries separated by a defined border. But as we’ve seen,wakefulness can also occur gradually. People move slowly through differentgradations of wakefulness as they follow spiritual practices and paths — or morespontaneously, as a result of living lives of service or mindfulness, or as aresult of a long process of loss or failure. Even when awakening happenssuddenly, a person can shift up to different degrees of wakefulness, in the sameway that, for example, an escalator can take people to higher or lower levels ofa building. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Myth 4: Wakefulness is the end point, the culmination, of our development.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Wakefulness is sometimes depicted as the end of our journey, a destination andculmination. When we attain enlightenment we’re surely safely home, on the otherside of the river. We’ve reached a state of complete fulfillment and there’ssurely nowhere left to go. Why would we want to go anywhere else?But in reality, awakening isn’t the end of the journey but the beginning of adifferent one. It’s not the end of the road but rather a switch to a differentroad. Awakened people continue to develop. They continue to find new resourcesinside themselves, uncover new potentials and energies, and evolve new aspectsand depths of their relationships with themselves, with other human beings, andwith the world in general. As one person described her shift to me, “It’s raisedme up a level. . . . It’s really a building block for me to move from.”Perhaps the best illustration of this is my friend Russel Williams, who — at thetime of writing — is ninety-five years old and underwent his awakening sixty-sixyears ago. For him, wakefulness has always been a fluid state, which is stilldeveloping and changing after more than six decades. As Russel told me, “Overthe years, new things have emerged, and I’ve begun to see in greater depth. Onebegins to look into more profound areas, to reach realms which one never knewwere there, or to see the same thing but with more clarity. There’s alwayssomething beyond. I’m beginning to wonder if there will ever be an end.”2[part0027.html#rch15en2] --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Myth 5: Awakened people live in a state of continuous bliss and ease, free fromall suffering and difficulty.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Despite their general sense of ease and the other aspects of well-being theyexperience (such as their sense of appreciation and their freedom fromego-isolation and thought-chatter), awakened individuals usually don’t livelives of perfect, continuous bliss.This is particularly true of the initial stages after sudden awakening. As we’veseen, the early stages can be full of confusion and disturbance, which may takeyears to fade and settle. But difficulties may still arise even once a person’swakefulness becomes stable and integrated. The awakened person may not beentirely free of psychological discord. Negative personality traits such as alack of self-confidence or a tendency to jealousy or guilt may be carried overfrom their previous state and take some time to fade away. Awakened people mayalso experience degrees of reactive negativity. For example, they may getirritated by other people’s behavior, feel upset by family or relationshipproblems, or feel worried about health or financial issues. Awakening doesn’tautomatically eradicate personality traits, nor does it eradicate all problems.“Degrees” is the important point, of course. Awakened individuals may not becompletely free of negativity, but they’re certainly more free of it. They’recertainly less likely to be negatively affected by external events and lessprone to reactive negativity. And this applies to different intensities ofwakefulness. People who are more intensely awake will be correspondingly morefree of negativity and correspondingly less prone to psychological discord andemotional upset. At the higher intensities of wakefulness, negativity may fadeaway completely. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Myth 6: Awakened individuals are incapable of behaving improperly.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is closely linked to the previous myth concerning freedom from suffering.The notion of awakened individuals as perfect people who always behave withimpeccable integrity and benevolence is as much of a romanticization as thenotion that wakefulness is a state of perfect bliss. Again, awakened individualsundoubtedly tend to be less self-centered and more compassionate and altruisticthan others due to their greater sense of empathy and their strong inner moralcompass. But wakefulness doesn’t completely eradicate the possibility ofunethical behavior, as shown by many cases of narcissistic and exploitativespiritual teachers (many of whom were genuinely awakened, at least to beginwith). --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Myth 7: Awakened individuals are detached from the world. They becomeindifferent to worldly affairs and are content for the world to remain as it is,without interfering.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------As I noted in chapter 13 [part0020.html#J2B80-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5],this myth isn’t completely without foundation, due to the otherworldlytendencies of some spiritual traditions. But in reality, most awakenedindividuals don’t live like this. They likely feel more concerned about thesufferings of other people and the injustices of the world due to their empathy,their sense of morality, and their wide, global (rather than egocentric)perspective. They feel a strong impulse to help alleviate other people’ssufferings, to encourage their development, and to make the world a betterplace. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Myth 8: Awakened individuals — or mystics — are passive and inactive. They justsit and meditate all day, immersed in their own blissfulness.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------This myth is closely related to the myth about detachment and also isn’t withoutfoundation — again, largely due to Christian, Buddhist, and Hindu traditions ofmonasticism and renunciation. (Interestingly, Jewish, Sufi, and Daoist spiritualtraditions aren’t monastic, which partly explains why they tend to be moreworldly and communally oriented.) But again, although awakened individualsgreatly enjoy being rather than doing, and may spend a lot more time “doingnothing” than other people, they may also be extremely active.Increased activity usually expresses itself through creativity or altruism —sometimes both. Awakened individuals who are artists tend to be extremelyprolific. D. H. Lawrence wrote over forty books during his short lifetime, whileWalt Whitman and William Wordsworth both wrote thousands of poems, with almostinexhaustible creative energy. This prolific creativity is possible becausethere’s little interference between the awakened artist’s own mind and thetranscendent source of their creativity. Other artists might struggle withwriter’s block or a lack of inspiration when their own thoughts and conceptsobstruct the creative flow, but awakened artists are like channels that alwaysremain wide open. The soft and subtle self-system of wakefulness ensures thatinspiration and ideas continually flow through.There are also many examples of awakened individuals who have pursued altruisticendeavors with incredible energy and determination. One of the best examples isFlorence Nightingale, who effectively created the profession of modern nursing,founding many hospitals and training tens of thousands of nurses. She alsoinitiated many other social reforms, completely revolutionizing approaches tohealth care and sanitation. A prolific writer, too, she was famous for herendless energy, which became known as “Nightingale power.” But what is less wellknown about her is that she was a deeply spiritual person who wrote severalbooks on Christian mysticism. Evelyn Underhill called her “one of the greatestand most balanced contemplatives of the nineteenth century.”3[part0027.html#rch15en3] As Nightingale herself writes, “Heaven is neither aplace nor a time. There might be a Heaven not only here but now. Where shall Ifind God? In myself. That is the true Mystical Doctrine.”4[part0027.html#rch15en4]Florence Nightingale’s life of intense altruism is by no means unprecedentedamong female Christian mystics. The fourteenth-century Italian mystic Catherineof Siena spent three years living as a hermit and an ascetic before undergoing apermanent shift into wakefulness. At that point she abandoned her solitude andwas active in society for the rest of her life, teaching, serving the poor andthe sick, and trying to bring peace to the warring states of Italy. Similarly,her fifteenth-century compatriot (and namesake) Catherine of Genoa spent fouryears living as an ascetic, until she attained a stable state of awakening. Fromthat point on, she was extremely active as a theologian and nurse, tending tothe sick and the poor of Genoa and eventually becoming the manager and treasurerof the city hospital. Similarly, the sixteenth-century mystic Teresa of Avilalived a life of frenetic activity, including founding seventeen convents andwriting several books.Part of the reason why it’s possible for awakened individuals to be so activeand energetic is because their energy comes from a transcendent source. Theydon’t have to make an effort — they simply allow action to flow through them. InDaoist terms, they engage in actionless activity (wu wei). They are in harmonywith the Dao, which expresses itself purely through them. They are expressionsof what I call transpersonal purpose. They don’t have a purpose that theyconsciously try to fulfill, as other people might consciously aim to achievegoals or to gain status, success, or wealth. They may not even have a clear ideaabout what their purpose actually is. But their purpose flows through them, froma transcendent source, and they simply allow it to express itself withoutinterference.5 [part0027.html#rch15en5] --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Myth 9: In wakefulness, the world is revealed to be an illusion.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Here we move into some more subtle misconceptions of the wakeful state. The ideathat the world becomes illusory when we wake up is related to the two previousmyths. After all, if the world is an illusion, then we’re entitled to beindifferent to it.The Hindu concept of maya is sometimes translated as “illusion,” but its actualmeaning is closer to “deception.” Maya is the force that deceives us intothinking of ourselves as separate entities and the world as consisting ofseparate, autonomous phenomena. In other words, maya prevents us from seeing theworld as it really is. It blinds us to the unity that lies behind apparentdiversity. It stops us from seeing the world as brahman, or spirit. So itdoesn’t literally mean that the world is an illusion, but that it’s not as itseems. It means that our vision of the world is not complete or objective, thatthere’s more to reality than we superficially see.The idea of the world as an illusion is sometimes specifically associated withHindu Advaita Vedanta (or nonduality) philosophy, but this interpretation ofAdvaita stems from a similar misunderstanding. The most influential AdvaitaVedanta philosopher was Sankara, who lived during the eighth and ninth centuriesCE. Sankara famously made three statements (later reframed by Ramana Maharshiand others): “The universe is unreal. Brahman is real. The universe is Brahman.”If the first two statements are taken alone and out of context — as they oftenare — then they suggest a duality between the world and spirit: the world is anillusion, and only spirit is real. But the third statement, which is oftenoverlooked, completely reverses this. The third statement says that the universeis spirit, and so the universe actually is real. Sankara is not literally sayingthat the universe is unreal, only that it doesn’t have an independent reality.It depends on brahman for its existence; it’s pervaded with brahman, and can’texist without it.Ramana Maharshi, perhaps the greatest Indian sage of the twentieth century, helda similar view. He explained that the world is not unreal in itself. It onlybecomes unreal when we perceive it purely in terms of its appearance and justsee interacting separate objects rather than an underlying spirit. That world isunreal, in the same way that a dream is unreal, because it’s based on delusion.But in itself the world is inseparable from spirit. It’s a manifestation ofspirit.6 [part0027.html#rch15en6]This is exactly what wakefulness reveals — not that the world is an illusion butthat the world as we normally see it is incomplete, a partial reality. Inwakefulness, the world actually becomes more real, partly in the sense that itbecomes more tangibly real and alive, more vivid and powerfully there, but alsoin the sense that it becomes infused with spirit. In wakefulness, we realizethat there’s no duality, no matter or spirit, no matter or mind. We realize thatthe physical world and the spiritual world are one, with no distinction. Theworld is gloriously infused with spirit and so gloriously real.Nevertheless, the idea of the world as an illusion is appealing to many people,as it offers a way of circumventing problems. If you’re facing difficulties inyour own life, and if the world itself is full of the suffering of your fellowhuman beings, then it’s comforting and convenient to tell yourself, “Oh well,it’s all just an illusion, so there’s no need to worry.” In other words, itoffers a means of spiritual bypassing, that is, using spiritual beliefs as a wayof escaping issues that need addressing.7 [part0027.html#rch15en7] (The ideathat the self is an illusion, which we’ll address in a moment, is anotherexample of this.)A similar attitude is sometimes applied to the body. After all, the body is madeof the same stuff as the world, so if the world is an illusion, the body must betoo, or at least it can be seen as something different and inferior to the mindor spirit. There’s a duality between the spirit and the body, just as there’s aduality between the spirit and the physical world. This attitude can lead to ahostile, repressive attitude toward the body, an attitude of disgust toward itsanimalistic functions and impulses, including sex. This attitude is illustratedby early Christian Gnostic teachings, for example, which held that all matter isevil, and the body is a prison to escape from. But again, in wakefulness thisduality is revealed to be false. The body is infused with spirit and is one withspirit. As Walt Whitman writes in “I Sing the Body Electric,” after listingdozens of different parts of the body, “O I say these are not the parts andpoems of the Body only, but of the soul, O I say now these are the soul!”8[part0027.html#rch15en8] --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Myth 10: In wakefulness, the self disappears. There’s literally “no one there.”Wakefulness is a state of selflessness.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------This misconception is closely related to the last. According to this view, theself is an illusion, just as the world is. When we wake up, we become no one.Our sense of personal identity disappears. There’s no longer a doer who performsactions; actions are just performed through us.Some modern nonduality (or Neo-Advaita) teachers take this view, but again, it’sbased on a misunderstanding. One metaphor sometimes used to describe theawakening process is that of the wave and the ocean. In our sleep state, we seeourselves as individual waves, separate from the whole ocean. But when we wakeup, we realize our oneness with the ocean, that we are the ocean, that we’veemerged from it and are always part of it. However, this doesn’t necessarilymean that we lose our identity as a wave. We can have an identity as a wave atthe same time as being part of the ocean — at the same time as being the ocean.We can still function as individuals, with some degree of autonomy and identity,at the same time as being one with the whole universe.One way to look at this is to see wakefulness not as a dissolution of self butas an expansion of self. In our sleep state, our identity is constricted, moreor less confined to our own mind and body. But as we wake up, our identity opensup, expands outward. It incorporates and encompasses wider realities. It expandsinto other people, other living beings, the natural world, the earth itself,until eventually it encompasses the whole cosmos. In conceptual terms, thisexpresses itself as a movement beyond a narrow egocentric outlook (with a strongsense of group identity) toward a global, universal perspective, with a concernfor overriding global issues and a sense of oneness with all human beings,irrespective of superficial differences of nationality or ethnicity.Perhaps one reason why wakefulness is sometimes seen as a state of no-self isbecause the awakened self-system is so unobtrusive and well-integrated into therest of our being that we may not actually realize that it’s there, in the sameway that if a person is sitting quietly in the corner of a dark room we may notnotice that the room is occupied. The functioning of the self-system may be sosubtle and quietly efficient that we may not realize that it’s actually takingplace. Its structure is so soft and labile that we may not realize that it’spresent.Here we can return to the analogy of the city that I used in chapter 3[part0010.html#9H5K0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5]. Our normal self-systemis like a city with thick walls around it; it seems to exist as an entity initself, in separation from the rest of the landscape. But in the wakeful state,our self-system is like a small unobtrusive settlement — an eco-village, perhaps— that is so well-integrated that you can hardly tell it apart from thelandscape as a whole. It has clearly emerged from the landscape; it’s made ofthe same materials as the landscape and merges into it without any sense ofseparation.The important point, again, is that there has to be some kind of self-systemwithin our being. There has to be some kind of organizational or administrativecenter within the landscape, even if it only plays a minimal, unobtrusive role.And a self-system implies some degree of identity, a sense of being someone whoinhabits the landscape of our being.You could say that awakening doesn’t mean no-self so much as new self. Awakeningmeans the emergence of a new self-system. After all, many of the shifters we’veheard from throughout this book describe awakening in this way — as if an oldself has dissolved away and a new one has emerged. They don’t feel that theyhave no identity but as if they have a new identity. They don’t feel that theyhave become nobody but that they have become somebody else. (In this sense, whentraditions such as Buddhism speak of “no-self,” it may be that they strictlymean “no separate self.”)You could think about this in terms of the concept of ego. Some spiritualteachers describe wakefulness in terms of having no ego, but this may not bestrictly true. Ego is simply the Latin and ancient Greek word for “I.” Sostrictly speaking, awakened people still have an ego, albeit a completelydifferent one. Returning to our city metaphor, our normal ego is a powerfulemperor who lives at the center of the city, in a giant castle that he keepsreinforcing and expanding. He believes he controls the whole city and even thewhole landscape. But in the self-system of wakefulness, there’s no emperor, justa simple administrator or executor whose authority is limited and who functionsas a democratic, harmonious part of the whole system.All too often, in spiritual circles, the concept of no-self is used as a form ofspiritual bypass, a way of avoiding psychological problems. If you don’t existas a self, then all the problems associated with yourself no longer existeither. For example, you might suffer from anxiety and low self-esteem, or befrustrated because your job isn’t suited to you, or distressed because yourpartner is abusive to you. But if you believe that the self is an illusion, youcan disregard these problems, pretend that they’re all just part of a “story”that has no significance.This is why the idea of no-self is so appealing to some people, but also why itis so confusing to others. Many people have an intuitive sense that they havepsychological issues that need to be resolved before they can undergo any real,stable spiritual development. They have a sense that they need to undergo somehealing or integration as a way of preparing the ground for awakening. So to betold that this self, which they feel needs some healing or growth, doesn’t existdoesn’t seem to ring true to them. And indeed, in such cases, to see the self asan irrelevant illusion isn’t just unhelpful but also counterproductive. It willactually intensify and extend the suffering of the separate self, not end it. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Myth 11: You can’t make an effort to wake up.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------According to this viewpoint, spiritual practices and paths aren’t effectivebecause to follow them implies making an effort to awaken and working toward agoal. After all, effort is egoic in nature. It means striving and so strengthensthe ego, which takes you further away from wakefulness. To seek enlightenment isfutile and self-defeating.In a similar way, having enlightenment as a goal strengthens the illusion oftime, which the ego thrives on. Goals invoke the future, which doesn’t reallyexist. Enlightenment is timeless, so how can we reach it in time? You can onlywake up right here, right now, by letting go of your striving.There’s certainly an element of truth to this. For some people, spiritualseeking is a form of egoic striving. They seek enlightenment in the same waythat other people seek success or wealth — as a way of gaining something, ofadding something to themselves. This is what Chogyam Trungpa calls “spiritualmaterialism,” when the search for enlightenment becomes a way of compensatingfor a sense of lack, much like more overt kinds of materialism. To take anextreme example, such a person might say to themselves, “Okay, I’m going to readas many spiritual books as I can, visit as many spiritual teachers as I can,meditate for at least five hours a day, and make sure I’m enlightened by the ageof thirty.” They might force themselves to meditate even when they’re feelingill, tired, or depressed. They might spend endless hours trying to understandthe most complex and esoteric spiritual teachings and eventually start to wonderwhen signs of awakening are going to appear. This kind of rigid ego effort islikely to be counterproductive and unlikely to lead to any real spiritualdevelopment.However, not all spiritual seeking is egoic in this way. There’s a much moredeep-rooted and organic impulse to awaken, which doesn’t stem from the ego butfrom the deepest part of our being. This impulse for growth and expansioncompletely transcends us as individuals; it’s an evolutionary impulse that isactually hundreds of millions of years old. The urge that so many millions ofpeople feel to explore spiritual teachings and follow spiritual practices andpaths is, in most cases, an expression of the same dynamic impulse that hasimpelled living beings to become more complex and conscious ever since thebeginnings of life on Earth. It’s an impulse to expand and intensifyconsciousness, and progress to a higher-functioning, more integrated state,which is exactly what has been happening to life-forms for millions of yearsbefore us through the process of evolution.In other words, for most people, spiritual development isn’t about gainingsomething or striving for a goal but about allowing this evolutionary impulse toexpress itself through them. Ideally at least, spiritual seeking means that theprocess of evolution is acting through us, encouraging us to move toward ahigher state of being on its behalf. It doesn’t strengthen the ego but helpstranscend it.As with the myth that the self is a meaningless illusion, the idea that we can’tdo anything to wake up confuses many people. This is inevitable, because itcontravenes their own deepest impulses and, in fact, contravenes one of thedeepest drives of nature and the universe itself.The blanket view of spiritual practices as counterproductive also stems from amisunderstanding of the nature of wakefulness and, in particular, the process ofgradual awakening. As we’ve seen, gradual awakening involves a remolding of ourself-system, a gradual shift from our old self-system to a new one. The wholepurpose of spiritual practice and spiritual paths is to generate that shift.Following spiritual practices and paths slowly dismantles the old self-system,softens its boundaries and heals its discord, allowing a latent wakefulself-system to emerge slowly. This shift doesn’t happen by accident, or throughsome kind of a realization or “seeing.” There has to be some kind of innerstructural change, which can happen suddenly and dramatically — usuallyfollowing intense stress or turmoil — or gradually, through spiritual practice.The view that we can’t do anything to wake up is sometimes justified with theargument that we’re already awake. How can we not already be one with the cosmoswhen our true nature is spirit? Surely, it’s simply a question of accepting whatwe already are. And we can only do this by giving up striving and accepting ourtrue nature.This is true in an absolute sense but not in a relative one. That is, it’s truethat essentially we’re one with spirit and therefore one with everything thatexists. Wakefulness is therefore our deepest nature. But just because this istrue doesn’t mean that we actually experience it. It’s actually normal for us tobe alienated from our true nature, due to the structures and boundaries of theself-system of sleep. It’s like saying to me — as an inhabitant of Manchester,one of the wettest cities in the United Kingdom — “Don’t worry about the cloudcover because there’s always blue sky beyond it; you just need to accept theessential blueness of the sky.” The sky may always be blue, but unless the cloudcover actually clears, I won’t be able to see it.However, although it’s a misconception, the idea that you can’t do anything toawaken contains an element of truth. While we follow spiritual practices andpaths, there’s always a danger that our practice can become too rigid and goaloriented. It’s possible that our deep impulse to awaken may become tainted withegoic striving. If this happens, then our conscious striving may block orobstruct the evolutionary impulse to awaken, in the same way that, for creativepeople, trying too hard or forcing themselves to compose or write may block theorganic flow of creativity. In the same way that a writer may experiencewriter’s block, a spiritual explorer may experience “spiritual block,” when theybecome too self-conscious or goal-directed.When this happens, letting go of the effort to wake up can actually beliberating. It may unblock our spiritual evolution and lead to a suddenflourishing, perhaps even to the sudden awakening we’re hoping for. At thatpoint, it might seem as if letting go of the effort was the cause of ourawakening, but, of course, it wouldn’t have happened without the years ofdevelopment beforehand. (This can cause difficulties if we advise others tosimply give up the spiritual search. Unless others have been through a similardevelopmental process to us, it’s unlikely that giving up the spiritual searchwill be of any use to them.)image [../images/00006.jpeg]The above discussion of the evolutionary nature of our impulse to awaken remindsus that awakening isn’t just an individual matter. It’s not just something wechoose to do or something that only has significance to us as individuals, or tothe people around us. It’s significant in that it can enable us to live muchhealthier, higher-functioning lives. But that’s only a small part of itsimportance. Awakening has to be seen in a much vaster context, as vast as thewhole universe itself. It has to be seen in the context of the evolution of lifeon our planet. And this is how we’ll view it in the last chapter of this book."},{"pageContent":"16. The Evolutionary Leap: A Collective Awakening [part0005.html#rch16]On a physical level, evolution can be seen as a process by which living beingsbecome increasingly complex and more intricately organized. According to thelatest scientific research, the evolution of life on this planet began aboutfour billion years ago — not long after the formation of the earth itself — withthe emergence of the first simple single-celled bacteria. Over billions ofyears, these single-celled bacteria became more complex. They developed nuclei,gained the ability to photosynthesize, and eventually began to reproduce throughsex. This led to much more complex multicelled creatures and then to thedevelopment of life-forms such as sponges, fungi, corals, and sea anemones, andthen to insects, fish, land plants, forests, and mammals.As evolution progressed, there was increased specialization and differentiation— more and more cells collected together and worked together more intricately,with different roles. This led to the development of the first brains (inflatworms). Over time, brains grew larger and larger, and their cells becamemore interconnected. After many millennia of gradually increasing complexity,the process led to the emergence of Homo sapiens, about two hundred thousandyears ago. We’re the most physically complex living beings evolution has yetproduced, with a hundred billion cells in our brains, interconnected sointricately that even now neuroscientists barely understand how they worktogether.But evolution has an inner dimension, too. The increasingly physical complexityis mirrored internally in the expansion of awareness and the intensification ofconsciousness. In these terms, we can see evolution as a process by which livingbeings become increasingly conscious and aware, both of the world and ofthemselves.At the same time as being the most physically complex beings on this planet,human beings are probably also the most intensely aware and conscious livingbeings. Although we can’t be certain, it seems likely that we have a moreintricate and expansive awareness of reality and a higher degree ofself-consciousness than any other animal.Three Different Types of AwarenessHere it’s useful to think in terms of three different types of awareness. Infact, I mentioned the first two of these in chapter 13[part0020.html#J2B80-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5]: perceptual awareness,which means experiencing the phenomenal world around us, and conceptualawareness. Here my use of the term conceptual awareness is a little more generalthan in chapter 13 [part0020.html#J2B80-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5]. ThereI used it to describe how wakefulness expresses itself in conceptual terms,resulting in a wider sense of perspective, a lack of group identity, and so on.But in a more general sense — not just in terms of wakefulness — conceptualawareness means being aware of concepts such as time, the past and the future,death and — more subtly — morality and justice. It means being able to think interms of categories and recognize the relationships, including the differencesand similarities, between different phenomena. It’s related to conceptual andsymbolic developments such as alphabets and written languages, numbers andmathematics, and systems of laws.The third type of awareness, which I haven’t mentioned specifically before, issubjective awareness, which means awareness of our own selves and our own statesof being. Even the simplest life-forms have perceptual awareness. For example,single-celled bacteria have the ability to move toward light or heat or sourcesof food, which shows that they have some form of rudimentary awareness. And someanimals clearly have more acute perceptual awareness than human beings, at leastin certain areas. For example, dogs have a much more acute sense of smell thanwe do, and they can hear sounds beyond our auditory range. But we human beingsseem to possess the other two types of awareness — conceptual and subjective —to a more intense degree than other animals. Some animals show degrees ofself-awareness — for example, magpies appear to be able to recognize themselvesin mirrors — and some animals, such as apes, can be taught a rudimentaryawareness of categories and numbers, showing some conceptual awareness. But theamazing intricacy and complexity of human language, compared to the apparentlyrudimentary languages of some animals, testifies to the unprecedented richnessof our conceptual and subjective awareness. No other animals appear to be ableto examine their own inner subjective world as deeply as human beings, or tohave as rich and intricate an understanding of the world we inhabit.However, we tend to forget that the human race as it presently is can’t be theend point of the evolutionary process. It’s completely illogical to assume thatevolution is just behind us, rather than in front of us as well. Theintensification and expansion of awareness will undoubtedly continue.And in my view, the phenomenon of spiritual awakening shows that this process iscontinuing among us, right now.Wakefulness represents an intensification of awareness in all three of the areasI’ve mentioned. It involves an intensified perceptual awareness, a broaderconceptual awareness (with a wider sense of perspective, a transcendence ofgroup identity, and a universal morality), and an intensification of subjectiveawareness, that is, an increased awareness of the richness and fullness of ourinner lives. So to me it seems that evolution is working through human beings,moving us collectively toward a new stage of development that is more expansivethan the present normal human state, in the same way that this normal state ismore expansive than the consciousness of other animals. Although the state ofwakefulness is relatively rare at the moment, one day — assuming we survive as aspecies — it will presumably become human beings’ normal state. In this way,present-day awakened human beings are a kind of evolutionary throw-forward, apremature glimpse of our future as a species.1 [part0027.html#rch16en1]Rethinking EvolutionI’m implying here that evolution isn’t just a random process generated bygenetic mutations and natural selection. In my view, there’s an impetus behindevolution that encourages a movement toward both greater physical complexity anda more expansive awareness. In other words, living beings have an innatetendency to develop in the direction of more intense perceptual, conceptual, andsubjective awareness.This purposeful view might seem strange to anyone who has been taught thestandard neo-Darwinist explanation of evolution, but there are, in fact, manyproblems with the standard view. It’s beyond the scope of this book to addressthese fully (I’m hoping to write a book about it in the future), but one of themain arguments against the accidental view of evolution is that it seemsimplausible that such a staggeringly positive and creative process could begenerated purely by a negative phenomenon such as random genetic mutations.According to the standard neo-Darwinist view, mutations almost always havenegative effects, and the life-forms that have them don’t reproduce and so themutations quickly die out. But very occasionally they have a beneficial effectand give life-forms an advantage in survival. These beneficial mutations areselected and become established in the gene pool, creating variations in speciesand eventually generating distinct new species.It’s true that these mutations have had many millions of years to supposedlycreate new species, but many philosophers and scientists have doubted that sucha negative accidental process could ever have had such creative consequences, nomatter how much time it was allowed. This isn’t just because positive mutationshappen so rarely but also because, in order to create significant changes(including the generation of new species), a long series of beneficial mutationshave to occur in sequence. Mutations have to be cumulative, matching perfectlyto previous mutations and occurring at the right place and time.2[part0027.html#rch16en2]It seems more plausible that there’s an impulse in life itself to move towardgreater complexity and at the same time toward a more intense awareness. Isometimes compare evolution to the development of a human being from embryo toadulthood. Here development moves naturally and inevitably from the simpleststate — when two cells meet and merge — through levels of increasing complexity,as cells split off and organize and start to form different parts of the body.The process unfolds along predetermined lines, following a kind of blueprint ormold specific to our species. I think evolution is similar to this but on anenormously extended time frame, unfolding over hundreds of millions of years.Perhaps the only difference is that the direction of evolution may not be asfixed as the development of individuals — perhaps there’s a simple tendency tomove toward greater complexity and awareness that is broadly directional withoutbeing completely predetermined.So in my view, to believe that evolution is accidental is as illogical as tryingto explain human development from an embryo to adulthood in terms of accidentalfactors. This process of ontogenetic (or individual) development closelyparallels the course of evolution itself over the past four billion years,moving from simple cellular structures to increasing complexity andspecialization. And this parallel includes the probability that both types ofdevelopment aren’t random but directional.Evidence for an Evolutionary LeapAccording to this view, there’s something inevitable about awakening. It’s thenatural unfolding of a process that has been under way for millions of years.Wakefulness is latent inside us, waiting to emerge. You could say that, in asense, it was always latent in living beings, even in the first single-celledbacteria. The Greek philosopher Aristotle originally put forward the idea (latertaken up by other philosophers) that all higher evolutionary forms are latent inlower ones. He saw evolution as the unfolding of latent potential, leading tohigher forms of life, all of which were inherent from the beginning.3[part0027.html#rch16en3] At the present time, the latency of wakefulness hasbecome so powerful that the state is ready to emerge. Indeed, wakefulness isalready emerging within us collectively, gradually moving the whole human raceto a higher-functioning state of being and a more expansive and intensive stateof awareness. We are, I believe, on the threshold of an evolutionary leap.There are a number of signs that this evolutionary leap is under way and thatwakefulness is collectively emerging within the human race. The first four,which I will discuss now, relate to direct individual experiences ofwakefulness.Natural WakefulnessFirst of all, as we’ve seen, wakefulness is natural for a small minority ofpeople. These are evolutionary throw-forwards in whom wakefulness isn’t latentbut has already expressed itself. They seem to be the spearhead of collectivetransformation.Of course, it could be that this is nothing new. Perhaps there have always beennaturally wakeful people. We certainly know of many awakened individualsthroughout history — for example, the Buddha, the Indian philosopher Sankara,the medieval Christian mystic Meister Eckhart, and the eighteenth-century Jewishmystic Ba’al Shem Tov. But in most cases we don’t have enough biographicalinformation to ascertain whether wakefulness was natural to them or developedgradually through spiritual paths, or through sudden transformation. At anyrate, we do know that natural wakefulness is occurring now.Temporary Awakening ExperiencesThe second sign of this evolutionary leap is that, among the great majority ofpeople who are not born in a naturally wakeful state, awakening experiences arevery common. Many people have temporary glimpses of the wakeful state, oftenwhen they’re inactive and relaxed, and their minds become quiet and calm. For afew moments, the self-system of sleep slips away and the wakeful state emerges,like the sun from behind a wall of clouds. This suggests our normal sleep statehas only a loose hold over us and can easily dissolve away, even if it usuallymanages to reestablish itself.The Impulse to AwakenThe third sign is that so many people feel an impulse to awaken. More and morepeople seem to sense instinctively that something is wrong with their normalstate of being, that it is limited and delusory. They’re aware that they’reasleep, and they want to wake up. As a result, they feel impelled to investigatemethods of transcending their normal state such as following spiritual practicesand traditions. Again, this suggests that our sleep state is losing its holdover us. It suggests that an evolutionary change is building momentum within ourcollective psyche. As I said in the last chapter, this individual impulse toawaken is an expression of the evolutionary impulse itself. It’s the same urgetoward an expansion and intensification of awareness expressing itself throughus.Awakening through Psychological TurmoilThe final sign, at least in terms of the individual experience of wakefulness,is the fact that awakening occurs so spontaneously and readily in response topsychological turmoil. This is probably the clearest sign of the increasinglatency of wakefulness. For shifters who undergo awakening in this way, thewakeful self-system seems to emerge fully formed, as if it had been latentinside them, waiting for the possibility to unfold, like a butterfly inside achrysalis. Although there are sometimes periods of confusion and disturbance asthe old self-system fades away and the new one establishes itself, the processseems natural and inevitable.As I’ve pointed out, this shift is much more common than is generally believedand is becoming more common. And again, this suggests that the wakefulself-system is ready to emerge within our collective psyche. It is alreadythere, fully formed and integrated, but only able to emerge (at least for somepeople) when the old self-system dissolves away.All of these are signs that the momentum of wakefulness is increasing, that it’sbeginning to unfold as the next stage in the evolution of life. As a result,it’s manifesting itself in a variety of ways, in the same way that a risingwater level manifests itself as overflowing rivers and lakes, and new streams,ponds, and tributaries. Wakefulness is also rising, and showing signs of itsemergence everywhere.A Cultural ShiftWakefulness is showing signs of emergence in less direct ways, too — in culturalchanges.These changes, I believe, have been clearly visible for about 250 years. Thesecond half of the eighteenth century was a very interesting time to be alive,particularly in Western Europe. For the previous few thousand years, Europe,like the rest of the world, had known little but brutality, oppression, andsuffering. For the vast majority of people, life had been — in the words of thesixteenth-century philosopher Thomas Hobbes — “nasty, brutish and short.” If youor I were able to travel back in time to, say, England in the early eighteenthcentury, we would be profoundly shocked by the cruelty and injustice weencountered, and the lack of compassion people showed to one another. We wouldbe horrified by the brutality with which landlords and nobles treated peasants,by the cruel treatment of children, by the barbaric punishment of criminals(which often took place before crowds of cheering spectators), and the brutaltreatment of animals. We would be shocked by the low status of women, who wereunable to gain an education, take up any professions, or participate in any wayin political or cultural life.But in the second half of the eighteenth century, a shift started to occur. InThe Fall, I refer to this as the Second Wave. The First Wave was the surge ofspiritual exploration that began around three thousand years ago, when people in“fallen” cultures around the world began to realize that they were asleep andthat it was possible to wake up; that is, they discovered that by followingspiritual practices and paths they could transcend the limitations of normalawareness and experience a more expansive and harmonious state. For centuries,this spiritual exploration was confined to small groups of mystics and adepts,who were loosely — and often controversially — affiliated with mainstreamreligions, such as the Sufis of Islam, Christian mystics, the yogis of Hinduism,the monks of Buddhism, the followers of Kabbalah, and so on.But the Second Wave brought more tangible and widespread signs of awakening.During this period, the second half of the eighteenth century, a new surge ofcompassion began to develop, together with a new awareness of the importance ofjustice and the rights of other human beings and other groups. This led to awhole host of social and cultural changes over the following decades, includingthe emergence of movements for women’s rights, animal rights, and the abolitionof slavery, and the development of concepts of democracy and egalitarianism,more lenient forms of punishment, and so on.This was also the time of the French Revolution and the American constitution,both of which were responses to the gross injustices of the feudal system, andbased on the principle that all human beings were born equal and entitled to thesame opportunities and rights. And culturally, this was when the Romanticmovement flourished, when poets, artists, and musicians developed a newrelationship both to their own inner world and the natural world. The poets,painters, and musicians of the Romantic movement explored their inner beings ina way that artists had never done before and expressed a new ecstaticappreciation of the beauty and grandeur of nature. (In evolutionary terms, thissuggests an expansion of both subjective and perceptual awareness.)It was almost as if human beings were developing a new ability to transcend theseparateness of the self-system of sleep. It was as if their identity wasexpanding beyond their own mind-space, bringing an ability to enter themind-space of others and so to empathize with them and feel compassion for theirsufferings. There was a new sense of connection — to other human beings, otherliving beings, and to the natural world in general.At the same time, these changes suggest a different conceptual outlook, givingrise to new principles of justice and morality. There was a movement beyondegocentrism and self-centered morality toward a more universal perspective.There was a movement beyond group identity toward a sense of common humanity.This process continued throughout the nineteenth century, expressing itselfthrough new egalitarian political philosophies such as socialism and the spreadof democracy. The women’s rights movement gained increasing influence — womenbecame able to own property independently of their husbands, go to university,and enter professions. (New Zealand became the first country to allow women tovote in 1897, with many others following over the next two or three decades.) Inliterature, novelists such as Charles Dickens, Emile Zola, and FyodorDostoyevsky documented the lives of their society’s poorest and most downtroddenpeople, illustrating the increased sense of empathy and compassion that wasdeveloping.During the twentieth century, the Second Wave intensified further and began toexpress itself in a wider variety of ways. The transcendence of ego-separationexpressed itself as an increasing sense of connection to the body and anincreasing openness to sex. A deepening connection to nature — and a widerconceptual outlook — gave rise to the ecological and environmental movements.Similarly, an increasing sense of empathy toward animals led to the popularityof vegetarianism and veganism (in addition to more awareness of animal rights).Over the last few decades this psychological change has also — arguably —manifested itself in a decline in conflict and warfare throughout the world as awhole. It might not seem like it when we read the newspapers and watchtelevision, but most historians agree that the last seventy years (since the endof the Second World War) have been the most peaceful period in recorded history,both in terms of conflicts between different countries and conflicts withincountries (such as revolutions and civil wars). At the same time, over the pastfew decades, an increasing movement away from materialism toward simplicity hasmanifested itself in the downshifting and downsizing movements, based on anawareness that the consumerist lifestyle is an obstacle to well-being, ratherthan the source of it.And finally, perhaps the biggest cultural change of the last few decades — andthe strongest cultural sign of the occurrence of a collective movement towardwakefulness — is the massive (and still growing) upsurge in interest inspiritual philosophies and the spread of spiritual practices such as meditation,yoga, and other techniques of self-development. And it’s significant that thisincreasing interest in spirituality has coincided with a decline in conventionalreligion. As we’ve seen, conventional religion can be seen as an attempt tocompensate for the suffering generated by our sleep state. But now there seemsto be growing movement to transcend our sleep state, rather than to simplyescape its effects.Everywhere there are signs of a growing sense of connection and empathy, a widerconceptual outlook, and a movement beyond both ego-isolation and egocentrism. Atthe same time, many of the behavioral traits linked to our sleep state, such asmaterialism and conventional theistic religion, have weakened — at least in somesections of society.Particularly when coupled with the four direct individual signs of awakening Idescribed above, these signs suggest that the human race is in the midst of acollective shift into a more expansive and higher-functioning state. Even ifthis process is a gradual and fitful one — and even if it may appear to be stillin its nascent stages — we appear to be in the process of waking up.The Trajectory of Human Evolution: Indigenous WakefulnessBut hold on, you might ask, didn’t I suggest early on in this book that earlierhuman beings and indigenous peoples lived in a state of natural wakefulness?Didn’t I say that our state of sleep occurred as a result of a “fall” out ofthis naturally wakeful state into separation and individuality? So how canwakefulness be an evolutionary advance when it was something that we already hadbut lost?I do believe that earlier human beings and some of the world’s indigenouspeoples were naturally awake. The collective wakefulness that is developing nowis, therefore, partly a return to that “unfallen” state. We are, in a sense,turning full circle.But our collective awakening also means more than this. It means regaining whatwe lost at the same time as gaining something new. The wakefulness we’redeveloping now is different from that of earlier human beings. At the same timeas representing a return, it represents a progression. When our ancestors “fell”into a state of sleep, they lost earlier peoples’ sense of connection to theworld and their awareness of the sentience and sacredness of natural phenomena.But the Fall was also an advance, in that it enabled our ancestors to developheightened intellectual and conceptual abilities.It would be a mistake though to suggest that earlier human beings lived in aninfant-like state. I think that the kind of wakefulness they experienced wasmore akin to our mature spiritual wakefulness than to the immature wakefulnesswe knew as children.4 [part0027.html#rch16en4] Unlike children, prehistoric andindigenous peoples clearly had (and have) some degree of individuality,practical and organizational ability, and ability to think abstractly andlogically. (In fact, as I point out in The Fall, a great deal of evidence showsthat prehistoric peoples were more technologically developed than is generallybelieved.) But when the Fall occurred, our ancestors became much more developedin these ways. We developed increased powers of abstraction, logic, andorganization, which led to a more rational understanding of the world andsignificant technological and scientific advances. The Fall led to complexwritten languages and mathematics, and important inventions such as the wheel,metallurgy, and the plow. These were the positive sides of the highlyindividuated sense of ego that came with the Fall.In fact, you could say that this was the very reason why the Fall occurred —these heightened intellectual powers became necessary. It’s difficult to saywhat caused the Fall, but my suggestion (in the book of that name) is that itwas due to an environmental change, a process of desertification that beganaround 4000 bce and affected large parts of central Asia and central andsouthern Europe. It became much harder for the people who lived in these areasto survive, and in order to do so, they had to develop new practical andintellectual abilities, and a heightened sense of individuality. This entailed areconstitution of the human psyche. A new, more individuated sense of egoformed, with heightened powers of abstraction and logic.But because this new ego was so powerful, it required more energy, so the energythat human beings had previously always used perceptually was transferred to theego. As I described in chapter 1[part0008.html#7K4G0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5], our ancestors’perception of the world became automatic as a way of conserving energy so thatthe new ego could have all the energy it needed to maintain its strong structureand its cognitive functioning. So our ancestors “fell” into a gray, shadowyworld of familiarity and otherness, and became marooned in a meaninglessinanimate world. (This is why we often have awakening experiences when ourego-minds become quiet and free of thoughts, because the energy that ourego-minds normally monopolize becomes freed up and is transferred back intoperception. Our perceptions become deautomatized again.)But what seems to be happening now — and the reason why we’re undergoing anevolutionary advance rather than just a return — is that we’re retaining theheightened intellectual and conceptual abilities we developed with the Fall, atthe same time as regaining the heightened perceptual awareness and the sense ofconnection of earlier human beings. In fact, in conceptual terms, you could saythat we’re not just retaining conceptual abilities that our ancestors gained butalso extending them by developing a much broader and deeper conceptualawareness. But far from becoming even more alienated from the world as a resultof this, we’re reconnecting with it. We’re turning away from the shadows on thewall of the cave, back toward the radiant and vivid world that we lost sight ofthousands of years ago.In terms of the types of awareness we discussed earlier in this chapter, youcould say that the Fall brought an increase in conceptual awareness (andintellectual ability) at the expense of a decrease in perceptual awareness. Butin the Leap, this imbalance is corrected. Perceptual awareness increases to asimilar level as before, without a decline in conceptual awareness (whichactually increases, too).Perhaps, most fundamentally, this is a matter of life-energy. The Frenchphilosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin believed that the process of evolutionentails a progressive intensification of “spiritual energy” in living beings,5[part0027.html#rch16en5] but I prefer to use the term life-energy. Theincreasing physical complexity of life-forms enables them to become moreconscious and alive; that is, it facilitates an intensification of life-energy.As some contemporary philosophers have suggested, the purpose of the brain maynot be to generate consciousness but to act as a receiver and a channel for it.According to this view, consciousness may be a fundamental force of theuniverse, which exists everywhere and in everything. The brain is like a radioset that receives consciousness and canalizes it into the individual being sothat the person becomes individually conscious. It localizes consciousness intime and space so that we have the experience of being individual beings livingthrough the moments of our lives. The more neurons a brain has, and the moreintricately these are organized, the greater the intensity of consciousness it’sable to receive.6 [part0027.html#rch16en6] But here, again, I’d use the termlife-energy rather than consciousness. As cells become more numerous and moreintricately organized, they enable living beings to become more imbued withlife-energy, that is, more alive.And this may be what is happening to us now. We’re becoming more imbued withlife-energy, more conscious and alive, which is precisely why we’re able toregain heightened perceptual awareness without sacrificing our conceptualawareness and abilities. Fundamentally, it’s the greater intensity oflife-energy — or spiritual energy, using Teilhard de Chardin’s term — that isgenerating this new wave of empathy and heightened awareness we’re experiencing,together with our intensified conceptual awareness.A possible problem with this argument, I’m aware, is that I’ve said thatintensifying life-energy is linked to the increasing physical complexity, inparticular of the brain. So am I saying that present-day human beings are morephysically complex than our ancestors of, say, five hundred years ago, beforethis new influx of life-energy occurred?Of course not. But the increasing complexity in this case may not lie in ourbrains or in us as individuals, but in us as a species. Over the last threehundred years, since the beginning of the industrial revolution, the human racehas become increasingly interconnected in more and more complex ways. Distanceshave collapsed, borders and boundaries have faded away, populations haveincreased and merged, and new technologies have continually increased thecommunications and interactions between people. (Teilhard de Chardin believedthis increasing interconnection was so significant that it was creating a wholenew domain of reality — the noosphere, as he called it, which would unite thewhole human race into a single inter-thinking group.) I admit that this is avery tentative idea, but it’s conceivable that this increasing globalinterconnectivity is somehow facilitating (or at least is associated with) acollective intensification of life-energy.The Time of Crisis — A Leap or a Collapse?And this leads us to our present situation. Where are we now?Despite the positive trends I’ve described above, we live in a time of crisis.It’s true that we’re living in a time of unprecedented spiritual awareness,unprecedented compassion and connection. But we’re also living in a time ofunprecedented danger. We live in a polarized world in which the trans-Fallmovement I’ve described above is opposed by extremely negative trends. Althoughmany people have begun to move beyond materialism, many others cling tomaterialist ideals more firmly. Obsession with celebrity and fashion and withthe acquisition of material goods and status seems more entrenched than everbefore, and it’s spreading around the world. Although there’s greater generalconcern for the environment than ever before, together with a greater sense ofconnection to the natural world, the destruction of the earth’s life-supportsystems is continuing apace, with governments and global corporations stillseeing the earth as little more than a supply of resources to be exploited.Although there’s probably greater concern for the welfare of other species thanever before, some scientists estimate that between 150 and 200 plant or animalspecies are becoming extinct each day, due to human activities. Although manypeople are moving beyond group identity and conventional religion to anall-embracing spirituality, many others are clinging to their religious andnational identity more firmly (as witnessed by the rise of Islamist terrorism,for example, the desire of many regions for independence, and the popularity ofnationalist anti-immigrant political movements).Perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised that some of these opposing traits seem to begetting stronger. When a new phase begins, the characteristics of the previousone often become stronger and more entrenched, in response to the threat oftheir demise. You could compare it to how immigrant communities sometimes feelthat their cultural values are threatened by the wider culture that surroundsthem. In response, they cling to their values more firmly and become even moretradition-bound and resistant to change than members of their original culture.Essentially, the cultural conflict taking place now is between the old valuesand traits associated with our sleep state and the new values and traitsassociated with wakefulness. The old traits are threatened and so seem to beasserting themselves more strongly. It’s almost as if, within our collectivepsyche, the self-system of sleep senses that it’s being superseded and is tryingto tighten its grip.At the same time, the crisis we’re going through could itself be having anawakening effect. The turmoil we’re experiencing — ecological breakdown,economic instability, rampant materialism, the mass movement of populations dueto poverty and warfare — isn’t dissimilar to the kind of psychological turmoilthat, for individuals, often precedes sudden awakening. You could even draw aparallel with encounters with death — which, as we saw in chapter 7[part0014.html#DB7S0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5], are the most powerfultrigger of transformation. At the moment, we’re collectively encounteringmortality, facing our potential demise as a species. So this threat may beserving as a spur to collective transformation. The evolutionary leap wasalready under way before these problems became so serious, but perhaps it hasbecome — and is becoming — more powerful as a result of them.Waking Up in TimeThe big question: Can we wake up collectively in time? Can the positive traitsassociated with wakefulness transcend the negative traits associated with sleepbefore our present crisis leads to catastrophe?In relation to this, it’s important to remember that our own individual psycheis connected to — and influences — our species as a whole. When we undergoawakening as individuals, we contribute to the awakening of our whole species.Our own Leap is part of the Leap of our whole species. As more and more of usmove toward wakefulness, the easier it becomes for others to do the same. Theblueprint of the wakeful self-system builds up within our collective psycheuntil eventually it may replace the self-system of sleep as the normal statethat all human beings naturally develop in adulthood.This is part of the reason why understanding wakefulness is so important, tohelp ensure that the people who undergo a sudden shift into awakening don’t feelconfused and repress their state (and aren’t diagnosed as psychotic bypsychiatrists). It’s imperative that wakefulness is allowed to express itself sothat its positive effects — both for the individual and our whole species — canmanifest themselves in the world.This is also why it’s imperative for us as individuals to follow our ownindividual impulse to awaken. It’s important for us not to suppress this impulse(perhaps under the misconception that making an effort to awaken iscounterproductive) but to allow it to guide us toward spiritual practices andpaths and consequently toward wakefulness. So long as we don’t become tooself-conscious and too rigid in our spiritual practice — in which case, it maybecome counterproductive — we, in our gradual awakening, contribute to theawakening of our whole species. When we follow this impulse to awaken in anorganic way we act as agents of evolution, helping to intensify the shift thatis already under way. Our own self-evolution contributes to the process ofevolution itself.Gradual awakening means practicing meditation and mindfulness, service andaltruism. It means embracing quietness, simplicity, and inactivity so that webecome comfortable within our inner space and learn to be. It means learning toquiet and disidentify with our random thought-chatter so that we know the peaceof inner stillness and connect with our deepest nature. It means softening thestrong boundaries of the ego so that we connect with other human beings, withnature, and with the whole cosmos. It means letting go of our psychologicalattachments to uncover the essence that they obscure and to allow our latenthigher selves to emerge. And perhaps most fundamentally, as we saw in chapter 6[part0013.html#CCNA0-281de7137404442191be68800736f9b5], gradual awakening meansremolding our psyche, transforming the self-system of sleep into the self-systemof wakefulness.There’s no reason why this should involve any individual effort. It’s not aquestion of pushing or striving, but rather of aligning ourselves with a processthat is already under way, like allowing ourselves to float along with thefast-flowing current of a river. We don’t need to swim, just let the river carryus. And at the same time, in a symbiotic way, our own momentum will intensifythe momentum of the whole process itself. The universe wants us to wake up andwill happily guide us toward wakefulness, if we create the right conditions.The New World of WakefulnessThe discordant and disconnected “fallen” psyche has been creating ever moreconflict and chaos in the world for thousands of years, and the process surelycan’t continue much longer. At the moment it’s not clear whether the process isspiraling to a chaotic and cataclysmic end or leading to a new beginning. But ifwe do undergo collective transformation in time, and so survive as a species,we’ll find ourselves in a different world. The dark and desperate world ofsleep, which has blighted human life with so much psychological and socialsuffering over the last few thousand years, will give way to a bright, new worldof wakefulness. The human race will move beyond rampant materialism and statusseeking, beyond group identity, and beyond war and oppression. The whole humanrace will know a new radiant vision of reality, a new inner well-being andwholeness, a new all-embracing empathy and common sense of humanity, a new senseof connection to the natural world and the whole cosmos, and a new peace, bothinwardly and outwardly. Our nightmare of discord and suffering will finally end.With a massive sense of relief, we will wake up to a new era of harmony andease. And we will know that this isn’t a delusion but actually the transcendenceof a delusion, the uncovering of a deeper and truer reality.Even if we don’t survive, the earth will recover eventually. Evolution willcontinue. Its trajectory can’t be reversed, only slowed down or frustratedtemporarily. Eventually new living beings will emerge who will experience theexpansiveness and clarity of wakefulness as their normal state. And evolutionwill continue even beyond that point, leading to new expanses and intensities ofawareness that we can’t conceive of. After all, there’s no reason to assume thatwhat we know as wakefulness is the end point of the evolutionary process, justas there’s no reason to assume that our present state is.But since we’re so close to this collective awakening ourselves, right now,there’s every reason for us to ensure that this process expresses itself fully —to ensure that we rise just a little higher, so that the Leap can completeitself."},{"pageContent":"The Human Race Will Rise Again [part0005.html#rch17]by Steve TaylorThe human race will rise again.This chaos isn’t inevitable; this discord won’t last forever.The evil that flows from us so easily isn’t innate.Our disorders are distortions, not permanent conditions,symptoms of a disease which will one day be cured.We weren’t born for constant conflict,to spend our lives fighting for survival, competing for recognition,defending ourselves against oppressionwith our minds infected with anxietyand our souls corrupted with bitterness.We were born for joy, and one day joy will return to usas spring always returns, bursting with life and lightafter the freezing winter.The human race will rise againas the cold hard masculine mind opens upto the soft warm spirit of the feminineas our solid frozen selves begin to meltand merge with nature againand selfishness gives way to empathy, and hierarchy to equalityand the impulse to connect transcends the desire for control.The human race will rise againas our senses begin to wake from centuries of sleepand nature shines with sacredness againand we’re dazzled by the world’s pristine beautyand awed by the depths of meaning which reveal themselvesbeneath the old flat surface of reality.The human race will rise again, and is slowly rising now.The shift is slowly settling.Balance is returning, a new structure is emerging,a pattern of vibrant new colors and shapeswith a new kind of harmony, more complex and dynamic,an order that’s stronger because it incorporates chaos,a sanity that’s deeper because it arose out of madness.The human race will rise again.The war will end, and the world will healand life will no longer be a frenzied struggle, full of stress and fearbut a glorious adventure, full of grace and ease,no longer a punishment to be endured, but a privilege to be savored.We were born for wholeness, and we will be whole again.We were born for joy, and we will return to joy.The human race will rise again."},{"pageContent":"Acknowledgments [part0005.html#rbm1]First and foremost, I would like to express my deep gratitude to all of thepeople who have contacted me to share their experiences of awakening.

As we’ve seen, Richard M. Bucke suggests that theonset of cosmic consciousness is most likely to occur between the ages of thirtyand forty, while in my PhD thesis the average age at which awakening occurredwas thirty-five. So it’s interesting that Peace Pilgrim’s state of wakefulnessstabilized around the age of thirty, as did my own. Eckhart Tolle’s spiritualawakening occurred at the age of twenty-nine, as did the awakening of my friendRussel Williams.5. Gradual Awakening in Spiritual Traditions 1 [part0012.html#ch5en1]. This relates to the point I made in Waking fromSleep about the difference between ongoing and permanent wakefulness. Ongoingwakefulness is when awakening experiences are continually stimulated and mergeinto one another. There are certain activities such as meditation, contact withnature, or periods of silence and solitude, that generate awakening experiencesquite reliably. So if you practice these activities regularly (as a monk mightdo, for example), it’s possible that you might maintain an ongoing awakeningexperience. But this is different from an actual state of wakefulness. In termsof the metaphor I use here, ongoing wakefulness is like managing to keep outsideof the house while it’s still standing; in the wakeful state, the house is nolonger there. Having said that, it’s very likely that ongoing wakefulness willlead to permanent wakefulness by bringing about a gradual remolding of theself-system. 2 [part0012.html#ch5en2]. Udana sutta, 1998. 3 [part0012.html#ch5en3]. Dhammapada, 2005. 4 [part0012.html#ch5en4]. Yoga Kundalini Upanishad, 2013. 5 [part0012.html#ch5en5]. Kundalini can also be raised in a gradual andcontrolled way through the practice of brahmacarya (usually translated as“chastity” or “celibacy”). In kundalini yoga, brahmacarya isn’t treated as atechnique of suppression of sexuality based on a hostile attitude toward thebody (as tends to be the case with celibacy in Christian traditions), but as adynamic process of transformation. In the practice of urdhvaretas, theinstinctive energies associated with the lower chakras move upward and aretransformed into the higher spiritual energy of ojas. This is a process of inneralchemy, in which energies are transmuted into a purer and higher form. There’sa similar idea in Daoism, where spiritual development (or “cultivation,” as itis more usually referred to) is also seen as an inner alchemy. 6 [part0012.html#ch5en6].

See “Resources.”13 [part0014.html#ch7en13]. Reading spiritual literature can sometimesfunction as a kind of therapy, too, creating an opening for transformation. Inchapter 6, we saw that it can sometimes be a factor in gradual awakening, and itcan occasionally trigger sudden transformation during a period of psychologicalturmoil. For example, Moira, who was exhausted and depressed due to the demandsof looking after a young baby, told me how she experienced a sudden awakeningwhile “I was reading The Power of Now and looking at the space in the room whenI suddenly felt my mind clear and I felt lighter as though all my problems hadgone.” Interestingly, I didn’t find that spiritual practice was a majorfactor in transformation through turmoil. In theory, spiritual practice shouldmake people more likely to undergo transformation by creating the same kind ofopening as therapy. But perhaps this doesn’t often occur simply because peoplewho are caught up in intense turmoil are unlikely to be following spiritualpractices. Spiritual practices and paths are more likely to be followed in timesof stability and relative quietness. It’s very difficult to meditate when yourmind is full of stress and anxiety.14 [part0014.html#ch7en14]. Sometimes it’s difficult to distinguishposttraumatic transformation from cases where a person’s natural wakefulness isbeing obstructed. A wakeful self-system that is ready to emerge but is beingblocked often causes frustration. It’s one of the basic laws of existence thatthe suppression or obstruction of natural processes creates tension and unease.This frustration can be powerful because the impulse to awaken is evolutionaryand so has the whole force of evolution behind it. So in some cases, when aperson experiences psychological turmoil prior to awakening, it’s difficult totell whether the turmoil is due to negative life events or the frustration ofbeing unable to express their natural wakefulness. (Of course, it’s highlylikely that there will be turmoil from both sources.) Eckhart Tolle is a possible example of this. He underwent a suddenspiritual awakening at the age of twenty-nine, after living for many years inwhat he describes as “a high state of anxiety, a state of depression,existential despair and anguish. There was a sense of great fear of life: fearof the future, fear of the meaninglessness underneath it all, but not wanting tofully face that meaninglessness and find out what underlies it.” (Taylor, 2011,p. 105) There were some external factors that may have contributed to thisstate, such as the rootlessness of his family life, his parents’ divorce, andhis sense of isolation. However, it’s also possible that Eckhart’s depressionand frustration stemmed from an innate wakefulness that wasn’t able to expressitself but which did eventually emerge, with great intensity, in his suddenawakening.15 [part0014.html#ch7en15].

In my research, very few people located thesource of this explosive energy specifically at (or close to) the bottom of thespine or described it as rising up through the spine. Most people gave moregeneral descriptions of energy rising through their bodies or intensifyinginside them. As two people whose experiences I didn’t describe above put it,there was “a feeling of an energy rushing through my body” and “a tremendousamount of energy coursing through my body.” A few other people reportedexperiences with similar characteristics to kundalini awakening but didn’tactually describe them in terms of energy rising inside them. They spoke interms of heat or light. For example, one person described a “huge golden brightlight, circular” rising from her solar plexus, spinning and growing brighteruntil it “moved through my body and filled my body. There was a flood of joyright through me.” This suggests that the traditional concept of kundalinienergy being coiled near the base of the spine and moving upward through achannel close to the spine may not be literally true. 6 [part0015.html#ch8en6].

It is interesting, by the way, that all ofthe sexual awakening experiences I collected were from women. Jenny Wade alsonotes that the experiences appear to be more common among women. Perhaps thishighlights a fundamental difference between male and female orgasms. Accordingto Daoist teaching, because men and women are expressions of the archetypalforces of yin and yang, they experience sex differently and have different typesof orgasm. The male orgasm is externalized and associated with expelling anddispersing energy, and reducing the life force. The female orgasm isinternalized and has an intensifying and energizing effect (de Souza, 2011).From this point of view, it doesn’t seem so surprising that sexual awakeningexperiences are more common in women.11 [part0015.html#ch8en11].

Stan Grof (2000) also notes that while spiritualemergencies are most commonly associated with intense psychological andemotional turmoil, they can also occur in response to spiritual practice,powerful sexual experiences, psychedelic experiences, or extreme physicalexertion. 2 [part0016.html#ch9en2].

A secondary shift sometimes follows fromtemporary awakening experiences. They often bring a new sense of optimism,trust, comfort, or confidence. For example, one person I spoke to had an intenseawakening experience following a period of intense psychological turmoil and“felt the most intense love and peace and knew that all was well” (Taylor, 2011,p. 4). The experience probably only lasted for a few minutes, but in itsaftermath she gained a new sense of appreciation and perspective, and a morepositive outlook. As she told me, “I looked around and thought about all thegood things in my life and the future. I felt more positive and resilient”(ibid.). Awakening experiences bring an awareness of a new spiritualdimension of reality. The person was unaware of this dimension before, but nowthat they have glimpsed it they feel a strong desire to return to it. They oftenbecome interested in spiritual traditions and practices as a way of getting backthere. For example, in an awakening experience apparently triggered bypsychological turmoil, Emma described “a moment of enlightenment” in which “allmy ‘problems’ and my suffering suddenly seemed meaningless, ridiculous, simply amisunderstanding of my true nature and everything around me” (Taylor, 2011, p.8). The experience gave her a new spiritual awareness and awakened a lifelonginterest in self-development. “In some ways,” Emma told me, “I have spent thelast 25 years since exploring what it meant and how I could perhaps go backthere” (ibid.).10 [part0016.html#ch9en10].

A similar 2006 study into theeffects of psilocybin found that 60 percent of the volunteers describedcharacteristics of mystical experiences, with just over one-third describing itas the most important spiritual experience of their lives, as significant as thebirth of their first child. A follow-up study two months later found that mostparticipants reported that their moods, attitudes, and behavior had become morepositive, while psychological tests showed that they had a significantly higherlevel of well-being compared to other volunteers who were given a placebo at thesame session (Griffiths et al., 2006).12 [part0016.html#ch9en12].

This is what Ken Wilber calls the “worldcentric”or “universal” outlook, as opposed to the “egocentric” and “sociocentric”outlooks. At the egocentric stage, we’re only concerned for our own well-being;at the sociocentric stage, we’re identified with our group and our compassionand extend concern to members of the group but no further. But at the universalstage, as Wilber writes, “Awareness is no longer trapped and limited to my groupor my tribe or my nation, but opens to a universal, global, worldcentricawareness, where all people are treated with justice and fairness, regardless ofrace, sex religion or creed” (Wilber, 2000, p. 158). 2 [part0020.html#ch13en2]. Adiswarananda, n. d. 3 [part0020.html#ch13en3]. The psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg (1981)describes this as a “post-conventional” morality. In sleep, people are much morelikely to experience what Kohlberg calls “pre-conventional” or “conventional”levels of morality. At the pre-conventional level, morality means simplyfollowing your own desires, without considering how your behavior affectsothers. Your only real guiding principles are to avoid punishment and to gainreward. “Good” is simply what is good for you. At the conventional level,morality means obeying social rules, abiding by laws and moral codes, and doingwhat is right for your country, or what the majority of your fellow citizenswould expect you to do. But at the post-conventional level, morality stems froman overriding sense of right and wrong. 4 [part0020.html#ch13en4]. Lawrence, 1994, p. 610. 5 [part0020.html#ch13en5]. Abraham Maslow recognized this autonomy as acharacteristic of “self-actualizers.” In his words, they were characterized by“independence of culture and environment” and “resistance to enculturation; thetranscendence of any particular culture” (Maslow, 1971, p. 129). 6 [part0020.html#ch13en6]. See Taylor, 2012b. 7 [part0020.html#ch13en7]. Robinson, 1977; Hoffman, 1992. 8 [part0020.html#ch13en8]. Maslow makes a similar point about “peakexperiences” in relation to traditional spiritual and mystical experiences. Helikens peak experiences to “raw materials which can be used for different stylesof structures, as the same bricks and mortar and lumber would be built intodifferent kinds of houses by a Frenchman, a Japanese, or a Tahitian” (Maslow,1994, p. 73).14.

This is an example of what Wilbercalls the “pre/trans fallacy,” which explains that it’s easy to confuse“pre-rational” states of development with “trans-rational” ones, and vice versa.It’s also an example of what he calls “retroromanticism,” our tendency toromanticize earlier phases of development. In Wilber’s view, this applies tocultural development, too, so that we tend to romanticize earlier humancultures, when they were in fact much less advanced than ours. 6 [part0021.html#ch14en6].

One potential issuehere is that reports of childhood spiritual experiences could be seen asquestionable because they are retrospective — for example, sometimes elderlypeople describe experiences they had when they were four years old — and areconveyed in language that children couldn’t possibly use. However, as MichaelPiechowski (2001) points out, spiritual experiences are so powerful and unusualthat they’re remembered much more vividly and with less distortion than otherexperiences. In addition, the memories of children are more reliable than isgenerally believed. For example, research by Sheingold and Tenney (1982) foundthat three- and four-year-olds can recall the events of a year ago with a greatdeal of accuracy, and no less accurately than eight-year-olds. And in relationto language, spiritual experiences are by their nature translingual. Even asadults we struggle to describe them, with the subject/object duality oflanguage, the different tenses, and the paucity of vocabulary for refined andintense states of awareness. An adult will certainly be able to explain theexperience more clearly than a child, but only because of their wider vocabularyand ability to use metaphor. But that has no bearing on the experience itself,which exists prior to and beyond language.16 [part0021.html#ch14en16]. Gopnik, 2009.17 [part0021.html#ch14en17]. Warneken, 2013, 2015.18 [part0021.html#ch14en18]. Gopnik, 2009, p. 212.19 [part0021.html#ch14en19]. This is probably why childhood awakeningexperiences are rarely, in the terminology used by the scholar of mysticismWalter Stace (1964), “introvertive” experiences. That is, they’re rarelyexperiences of withdrawing from the external world and attaining a state ofinner well-being and spaciousness, or, at a higher intensity, a state of inneremptiness or pure consciousness in which we touch into the spiritual essence ofall reality. They are almost always “extravertive”; that is, they are mainlyexperiences of heightened awareness and connection or union.20 [part0021.html#ch14en20]. Wordsworth, 1994, p. 587.15.

The Evolutionary Leap: A Collective Awakening 1 [part0023.html#ch16en1]. I’m certainly not the first person to putforward such a spiritual view of evolution. Many philosophers have suggestedthat evolution is a purposeful process of the unfolding and intensification ofconsciousness, including the German philosophers Georg Wilhelm Freidrich Hegeland Johann Gottlieb Fichte, the French philosophers Henri Bergson and PierreTeilhard de Chardin, and the American philosopher Ken Wilber. Hegel saw humanhistory as a progressive unfolding of spirit, leading to a state of reason — theculmination of human development — in which there’s no distinction between theobjective and subjective, and all things merge into oneness. Teilhard de Chardinsaw evolution as a process of the spiritualization of matter, which wasprogressing toward an “Omega Point.” This is the culmination of the wholeevolutionary process, when all matter is wholly infused with spiritual energyand all phenomena, including human beings, become one. In his book CosmicConsciousness, which I referred to in chapter 3, Richard M. Bucke describes hisconviction that cosmic consciousness is a stage of development that awaits thehuman species as a whole. Bucke distinguishes two other types of consciousness.First, there is the simple consciousness of animals (and early human beings),which means that they are aware of their surroundings and have the ability torespond to changes in their environment. Second, there is the self-consciousnessof human beings, which probably developed, according to Bucke, just a fewthousand years ago. This means that, for the first time, in addition to beingaware of their surroundings, human beings are aware of themselves. And now we’rewitnessing the onset of cosmic consciousness. Although, according to Bucke, itis quite rare at the moment, cosmic consciousness is becoming increasinglycommon and will eventually spread to every member of the human race. In thefuture, it will become human beings’ normal state, which we all naturallydevelop into in adulthood. 2 [part0023.html#ch16en2].

To be more specific, of all the characteristicswe looked at in chapters 12 and 13, the only ones I feel that primal humanbeings didn’t possess were the conceptual characteristics of “lack of groupidentity” and “wide perspective / universal outlook.” Most primal peoples had astrong sense of tribal identity, although this probably wasn’t prompted by aneed for security and belonging (as it is for most modern humans) but simply theresult of a lack of other cultural references. Similarly, their lack of auniversal outlook was probably the simple result of their narrow experience ofthe world and other cultures. 5 [part0023.html#ch16en5].
