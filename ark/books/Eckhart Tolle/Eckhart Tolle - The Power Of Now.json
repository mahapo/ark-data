DICARLO Author of Towards a New World View Blan keted by an azure sky, the orange-y ellow rays of the setting sun can, at special times, gift us with a mo ment of su ch considerable beau ty, we find ourselves momentari ly stunned, with frozen gaze. The splendor of the m oment so dazzles us, our com pulsively chattering m inds give pause, so as not to mentally whi sk us away t o a place other than the here-and-now. Bathed in lum inescence, a door seem s to open to another reality, always presen t, yet rarely witnessed. Abraham Maslow called these \"peak experi ences ,\" since t hey represent the high moments of li fe where we joyfully find ourselves catapulted be yond the confines of the m undane and ordinary. He m ight ju st as well have called them \"peek' experiences. During these expansive occasi ons, we sneak a glimpse of the eternal realm of Being itself. If onl y for a brief mome nt in time, we come hom e to our True Self. 'Ah,\" one might sigh, \"so grand ... if only I could stay here. But how do I take up permanent residence?\" During the past ten years, I have committed myself to finding out. During m y search, I have been honored to engage in dialogue with some of the m ost daring, inspiring and insightful \"paradigm pioneers\" of our tim e: in medicine, science, psychology, business, religion / spirituality, and hum an p otential. This diverse group of individual s is j oined by their c omm only voiced insight that humanity is now taking a quantum leap forward in its evolut ionary development. This ch ange is acco mpanied by a shift i n world vi ew – the basic picture we carry with us of \"the way things are.\" A world view seeks to answer two fundame ntal questions, \"Who are we?\" and \"What is the nature of the Universe in which we live?\" Our ans wers to these questions dictate the quality and characteristics of our pe rsonal relationships with fam ily, friends and em ployers /em ployees. When cons idered on a larger scale, they define societies. It should be of little surprise that the world view which is emerging calls into question many of the things Western society holds t o be true: MYTH #1 Humanity has reached the pinnacle of its development. Esalen co-founder Michael Murphy, draw ing upon com parative religious studies, medical science, anthropol ogy, and sports, has made a provocative case that there are 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"more advanced stages of hum an developm ent. As a person reaches these advanced levels of spiritual maturity, extraordin ary capacities begin to blossom - of love, vitality, personhood, bodily awareness, intu ition, perception, co mm unication, and volition. First step: to recognize they exist. Mo st people do not. Then, methods can be em ployed with conscious intent ion. MYTH #2 We are completely separate from each other, nature, and the Kosmos. This m yth of \"other-than-m e\" has been res ponsible for wars, the rape of the planet, and all form s and expressions of hum an injustice. After a ll, who in their right m ind would harm another if they e xperienced t hat person as part of them selves? Stan Grof, in his research of nonordi nary states of consciousness, summarizes by saying \"the psyche and consciousness of each of us is , in the last analys is, commensurate with \"All-That-Is\" becaus e there are no absolu te boundaries between the body/ego and the totality of existence.\" Dr. Larry Dossey' s Era-3 medicine, wher e the thoughts, attitudes, and healing intentions of one indivi dual can influe nce the physiology of another person (in contrast to Era-2, prevailing m ind-body medi cine) is very well s upported by scientific studies into the healing power of prayer . Now this can 't happen acco rding to the known principles of physics and world vi ew of traditi onal science. Yet the preponderance of evidence suggests that indeed it does. MYTH #3 The physical w orld is all there is. Materialistically bound, trad itional science assum es that anything t hat cannot be measured, tested in a laborator y, or probed by t he five senses or their technological extensions sim ply doesn' t exist. it' s \"not real.\" Th e consequence: all of reality has been collapsed into physical reality. Sp iritual, or what I would call nonphysic al, dimensions of reality have been run out of town. This clashes with the \"perennial philosophy, \" that philosophi cal consensus spanni ng ages, religions, traditions, and cultures, which describes differe nt but conti nuous dimensions of reality. These run from the m ost dense and least conscious - what we' d call \"matter\" - to the least dense and m ost conscious, which we' d call spiritual. Interestingly enough, this extended, m ultidi mensional m odel of r eality is suggested by quantum theorists such as Jack Scarfetti who de scribes superlum inal travel. Other dimensions of reality are used to explain tr avel that occurs fast er than the speed of light - the ultimate of speed lim its. Or c onsider the work of the legendary physicist, 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"David Bohm , with his e xplicate (physical) and i mplicate (non-physi cal) multidim ensional model of reality. This is no m ere theory - the 1982 Aspect Experiment in France demonstrated, that two once-connected quantum particles se parated by vast distances rem ained somehow connected. If one particle was ch anged, the other changed - instant ly. Scientists don' t know the m echan ics of how this faster-than-the-speed-of-li ght t ravel can happen, though some theorists suggest that this connection takes place via doorways into hi gher dimensions. So contrary to what those who pledge th eir allegiance to the traditional paradig m might think, the infl uential, pi oneering i ndi viduals I spoke with fe lt that we have not reach ed the pinnacle of hum an development, we ar e connected, rather than separate, from all o f life, and that the full spectru m of consciousness encom passes both phys- ical and a m ultitude of non phys ical dim ensions of reality. At core, this new world view invol ves seei ng yourself, others, and all of life, not through the eyes of our sm all, earthly self that lives in tim e and is born in tim e. But rather through the eyes of the soul, our Being, the True Self. One by one, people are jum ping to this highe r orbit. With his book, The Power of Now, Eckhart Tolle rightful ly takes his place am ong this special group of world-class teachers. Eckha rt's message: the problem of hum anity i s deeply rooted in the m ind itself. Or ra ther, our m isidentification with m ind. Our drifti ng awareness, our tendency to take the p ath of least resistance b y being less than fully awake to the pr esent m oment, creates a void. And the tim e-bound m ind, which has been designed to be a useful servant, com pensates by procl aim ing itself master. Like a butterfly flitteri ng from one flower to anot her, the m ind engages past experiences or, proje cting its own m ade-for-tel evision movie, antici pates what is to com e. Seldom do we find ourselves resting i n the oceanic depth of the here and now. For it is here - in the Now - where we find our True Self, which lies behind our physical body, shifti ng em otions, and chattering m ind. The crowning glory of hum an development rests not in our abili ty t o reason and think, t hough this i s what distinguishes us from animals. Intellect, like instinct , is merely a point along the way. Our ulti mate de stiny is to re-connect with our essential Being and express from our extraordinary, divine reality in the ordinary physic al world, m oment by m oment. Easy to say, ye t rare are those who have attained the further reaches of human devel opment. Fortunately, there ar e guides and teacher s to help us along the way. As a teach er and guide, Eckhart' s form idable power lies not in his adept ability to delight us with 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"entertaining stories, make the abstract conc rete, or provi de useful technique. Rather, his m agic is seated in his personal experien ce, as one who knows. As a result, there is a power behind hi s words found only i n the most celebrated of spiritual teachers. By living from the depths of this Greater Reality , Eckh art clears an energetic pathway for others to j oin him . And what if others do? Surely the world as we know it would change for the bett er. Values would shift in the fl otsam of vani shing fears that have been funneled away through the whirlpool of Being itself. A n ew civilization would be born. \"Where' s the proof of this Greater Reality?\" you ask. I offer only an analogy: A battery of scientists can get together and tell you about all the scientifi c proof for the fact that bananas are bitter. But all you have to do is taste one, once, to realize that there is this whole other aspect to banana s. Ultim ately, proof lies not in intellectual arguments, but in being touched in som e way by the sacred within and without. Eckhart Tolle m asterfull y opens us to that possibili ty. Russell E.

Until m y thirtieth ye ar, I lived in a state of alm ost continuous anxiety interspersed with periods of suici dal depression. It feel s now as if I am talking about some past lifetime or somebody else' s life. One night not l ong after m y twenty-ninth bi rthday, I woke up in the early hours with a feeling of absolut e dread. I had woken up with such a feeling many tim es before, but this time it was m ore inten se than it ha d ever been. Th e sile nce of the night, the vague outl ines of the furnit ure in the dark room , the distant noise of a passing t rain - everything felt so ali en, so host ile, and so utterly meaningless that it created in me a deep loathing of t he world. The m ost loat hsom e thing of all, however, was m y own existence. What was the point in continui ng to live with this bu rden of m isery? Why carry on with thi s continuous st ruggl e? I could feel that a deep longing for annihilation, for nonexistence, was now b ecom ing m uch stronger th an the instinctive desire to continue to live. \"I cannot l ive with myself any l onger.\" This was the thought that kept repeating itself in m y m ind. Then suddenly I became aware of what a peculiar thought i t was. `Am I one or two? If I cannot live with m yself, there must be two of me: the `I' and the `self' that `I' cannot live with.\" \"Maybe,\" I thought, \"only one of them is real.\" I was so stunned by this strange realiza tion that m y m ind stopped. I was fully conscious, but there were no more thoughts. Then I felt drawn into what seemed like a vortex of energy. It was a slow m ovem ent at first and then accelerate d. I was gripped by an intense fear, and m y body star ted to shake. I heard the words \"resist nothi ng,\" as if spoken inside my chest. I could feel m yself being sucked into a void. It felt as if the void w as inside m yself rather than outside. Suddenly, there was no m ore fear, and I let m yself fall into that void. I have no recollection of what happened after that. I was awakened by the chirping of a bird outside the window. I had never heard such a sound before. My eyes were still clos ed, and I saw the image of a precious diam ond. Yes, if a diam ond could m ake a s ound, this is what it would be like. I 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"opened my eyes. The first light of dawn was filtering through the curtains. Without any thought, I felt, I knew, that there is infini tely m ore to light than we realize. That soft lum inosity filtering through the curtains was love itself. Tears came into my eyes. I got up and walked around the room . I recognized the room , and yet I knew that I had never truly seen it before. Everyt hing was fresh and pristi ne, as if it had just come into existence. I picked up things, a p encil, an em pty bottle, m arveling at the beauty and aliveness of it all. That day I walked around the city in utter am azement at the m iracl e of life on earth, as if I had just been born int o this world. For the next five months, I li ved in a stat e of uninterrupted deep peace and bliss. After that, it diminished somewhat in intensity , or perhaps it just seemed to because it became my natural state. I c ould still function in the worl d, although I realized that nothi ng I ever did could possibl y add anything to what I alread y had. I knew, of course, that som ething profou ndly si gni ficant had happened to me, but I didn' t understand it at all. It wasn' t until several years later, after I had read spiritual texts and spent tim e with spiri tual teachers , that I realized that what everybody w as looki ng for had already happened to me. I underst ood that t he intense pressure of suffering that night m ust have forced my consciousness to withdraw from its identification with the unhappy and deeply f earful self, which is ultim ately a fiction of the m ind. This wi thdrawal m ust have been so c omplete that this false, suffering self immediately collapsed, just as if a plug had been pulled out of an i nflatable toy. What was left then was m y true nature as the ever-present I am : consciousness i n its pure state prior to identification with form. Later I also learned to go into that inner timeless and deathless real m th at I had origin ally perceived as a void and remain fully conscious. I dwelt in states of such indesc ribable bliss and sacredness that even t he origi nal experience I just described pale s in comparison. A time came when, for a while, I was left with nothi ng on the physical plane. I had no relationshi ps, no job, no hom e, no socially defined identity. I spent alm ost two years sitting on park benches in a state of the most intense joy. But even t he most beautiful experiences co me and go. Mo re fundam ental, perhaps, than any experience is the undercurrent of peace that has never left me since then. Som etimes it is very strong, alm ost palpab le, and others can feel it too. At other times, it is somewhere in the ba ckground, like a distant melody. Later, peo ple would occasional ly come u p to me and say: \"I want what y ou have. Can you give it to m e, or show m e how to get it?\" And I would say: \"You have it already. You just can't f eel it because your m ind is malting too m uch n oise.\" Th at answer l ater grew into the book that you are holdi ng in your hands. 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Before I k new it, I h ad an external identity again. I had beco me a spiritual teacher. The Trut h That Is Within You This book represents the esse nce of m y work, as far as it can be conveyed in words, with individuals and small groups of spi ritu al seekers during the past ten years, in Europe and in North America. In deep l ove and appreciation, I would like to thank those exceptional people for their courag e, their willingness to e mbrace inner change,their challenging questi ons, and thei r readiness to listen. This book would not have come into exi stence w ithout them. They belong t o what is as yet a sm all but fortunately growing minority of spiritual pioneers: people who are reaching a point where they beco me capable of breaking out of i nherited collective mind-patterns that have kept hum ans in bondage to suffering for eons. I trust that this book will find its way to those who are ready for such radical in ner transform ation and so act as a cat alyst for it. I also hope that it will reach m any others who will find its content worthy of consider ation, although they may not be ready to fully live or practice it. It is possible that at a later time, the seed that was sown when reading this book will merge with the seed of enlightenment that each human bei ng carries within, and suddenly tha t seed w ill sprout and co me aliv e within them . The book in its present form originated, often spontaneously, i n response to questions asked by i ndivi duals in sem inars, meditati on classes and pri vate counseling sessions, and so I have kept the question and answer form at. I learned and received as m uch in those classes and sessions as t he questione rs. Some of the questions a nd answers I wrote down alm ost verbatim . Others are gene ric, wh ich is to say I com bined certain types of' questions that we re frequently asked int o one , and extracted the essence from different answers to form one generi c ans wer. So meti mes, in the process of writing, an entirely new ans wer came that was m ore profound or i nsightful t han anything I had ever u ttered. Some additional questions were asked by the editor so as to provide further clarification of certain point s. You will find that from the first to the la st page, the dialogues continuously alternate between two different levels. On one level, I draw your attention to what is false in you. I speak of the nature of hum an unconsciousness and dysf unction as well as its most common behavi oral manifestations, from conflict in relationships t o warfare between tribes or nati ons. Such knowledge is vital, for unless you lear n to recognize the false as false --as not you-- there can be no lasting transform ation, and you woul d always end up being drawn back into i llusion and i nto som e form of pain. On this level, I also show you 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"how not to make that which is false in you into a self and int o a personal problem , for that is how the false perpetuates itself. On another level, I speak of a profound t ransform ation of human consciousness - not as a distant future possibili ty, but ava ilable now - no matter who or where you are. You are shown how to free yourself from en slavement to the m ind, enter into this enlightened state of consciousness and sustain it in everyday life. On this level of the book, t he words are not always concerned with inform ation, but often desi gned to draw you into this new consciousness as you read. Again and again, I endeavor to take you with m e into that timeless state of intense conscious presence in the Now, so as to give you a taste of enlightenment. Until you are able to expe- rience wh at I speak of, you m ay find those passages som ewhat repetitive. As soon a s you do, however, I belie ve you will realize that they cont ain a great deal of spiritual power, and they may become for you th e m ost rewarding parts of the book. Moreover, since every person carries the seed of enlighten ment within, I often address myself to the knower in you who dwells behind the thinker, the deeper self that immediately recognizes spiritual trut h, resonates with it, a nd gains st rength from it. The pause sym bol ~ after certain passages is a suggestion that you m ay want to stop reading for a m oment, beco me still, and feel and experience the truth of what has just been said. There may be other places in the text where you will do this naturally and spontaneously. As you be gin reading the book, the meaning of certain words, such as \"Being\" or \"presence,\" m ay not be entirely clear to yo u at first. Just read on. Questions or objections may occasionally come into your m ind as you read. They will probably be answered later in the book, or they may tu rn out to be irrelevant as you go m ore deeply into the teach ing - and into yourself. Don' t read with the m ind only. Watch out for any \"feeling response\" as you read and a sense of recognition from deep within. I ca nnot tell you any spirit ual truth that de ep within you don' t know already. All I can do is rem ind you of what you have forgotten. Living knowledge, an cient and yet ever n ew, is then activat ed and releas ed from within every cell of your body. The m ind always wants to cat egorize and co mpare, but this book will work better for you if you do not attem pt to com pare its te rm inology with that of other teachings; otherwise, you will probably becom e confused. I use words such as \"min d,\" \"happiness,\" and \"consciousne ss\" in ways that do not nece ssarily correlate with other teachings. Don' t get attached to any words. They are only stepping stones, to be left behind as quickly as possi ble. 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"When I occasionally quote t he words of Jesus or the Buddha, from A Course in Miracles or from other teachings, I do so not i n order to compare, but to draw your attention to the fact that in essence there is and al ways has been only one spirit ual teaching, although it com es in many form s. Som e of these fo rms, such as the anci ent religions, have become so ove rlaid with extraneous matter that their spiritual essence has beco me al most co mplet ely obscured by it. To a large extent, therefore, thei r deeper meaning is no longer recognized and their t ransform ative power lost. When I quote from the ancient religions or ot her te achings, it is to reveal their deeper meaning and thereby restore their transf orm ative power - particularly for those readers who are followers of these religions or teachings. I say to them: there i s no need to go elsewher e for the truth. Let me show you how to go m ore deeply int o what you already have. Mostly, however, I have endeavored to use term inology that is as neutral as possi ble in order to reach a wide range of people. This book can be seen as a res tatement for our tim e of that one timeless spiritual teachi ng, the essence of all religions. It is not derived from external sources , but from the one true Source within, so it contains no theory or speculation. I speak from inne r experience, an d if at times I speak forcefully, it is to cut through heavy layers of mental resistance and to reach that place within you where you already know, just as I know, and where the truth is recognized when it is heard. There is then a feeling of exaltation and heightened aliveness, as som ething within you says: \"Yes. I know this is true.\" 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"1. YOU ARE NOT YOUR MIND The Grea test Obstac le to Enlightenment Enlightenment - what is that ? A beggar had been sitting by the side o f a road for over thirty years. One day a stranger walked by. \"Spare some chang e?\" m umbled th e beggar, mechani cally holdi ng out his old baseball cap. \"I have nothi ng t o give you, \" said the st ranger. Then he asked: \"What' s that you are sitting on? \" \"N othing,\" replied the beggar. \"Just an old box. I have been sitting on it for as long as I can remem ber.\" \"Ever looked inside ?\" asked the stranger. \"No,\" sa id the beggar. \"What' s the point? There's nothi ng in there.\" \"Have a look inside,\" insisted th e stranger. The beggar managed to pry open the lid. With astonishment, di sbelief, and elation, he sa w that the box was filled with gold. I am that stranger who has not hing to give you and who is telling you to look inside. Not inside any box, as in the pa rable, bu t somewh ere ev en closer: inside yourself. \"But I am not a beggar,\" I can hear you say. Those who have not found their true wealth, which is th e radiant joy of Being and the deep, unshakable peace that co mes with it, are beg gars, even if they have great material wealth. They are looking outs ide for scraps of pleasure or fulfillm ent, for validation, security, or love, while th ey have a treasure within that not onl y includes all those thi ngs but is i nfini tely greater than anything t he world can offer. The word enlightenment conjures up t he idea of some super-human accom plishment, and the ego lik es to keep it that way, but it is sim ply your natural state of felt oneness with Being. It is a state of connectedness with somethi ng immeasurable and indestructi ble, something that, alm ost paradoxically, is essenti ally you and yet is m uch greater than you. It is finding your true na ture beyond nam e and form . The inability to feel this connectedness gives rise to the illu sion of separation, from yourself and from the world around you. You then pe rceive yourself, consciousl y or unconsciously, as an isolated frag ment. Fear arises, and conflict within and without becom es the norm. I love the Buddha' s sim ple defin ition of enlightenment as \"the end of suffering.\" There is nothi ng superhum an in that, is t here? Of course, as a definition, it is 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"incom plete. It only tells you what enlight enm ent is not: no suffering. But what' s left when there is no m ore suffering?

He uses a negative definition so that the m ind cannot m ake it into something to believe in or int o a superhum an accom plishm ent, a goal that is impossible for yo u to attain. Despite this precaution, the majority of Buddhists still believe that enlightenm ent is for the Buddha, not for them, at least not in this lifetime. You used the word Being. Can y ou explain what you mean by that ? Being is the eter nal, ever-present One Life beyond t he m yriad form s of life that are subject to birth and death. However, Being is not only beyond but also deep within every form as its innerm ost invisibl e and indestructible essence. This means that it is accessible to you now as your ow n deepest self, your true nature. But don't seek to grasp it with your m ind. Don' t tr y to understand it. You can know it onl y when the m ind is still. When you are pres ent, when your atte ntion is fully and intensely i n the Now, Being can be felt, but it can never be understood mentally. To regain awareness of Being and to abide in that state of \"feeling-realization\" is enlightenment. When you say Being, are you talking abou t God? If you are, then why don't you say it? The word God has beco me empt y of meaning through thousands of years of misuse. I use it sometim es, but I do so spar ingly. By m isuse, I m ean that people who have never even glim psed the realm of th e sacred, the infini te vastness behind t hat word, use it with great conviction, as if they knew what they are talking about. Or they argue against it, as if they knew what it is tha t they are denying. This m isuse gives rise to absurd beliefs, assertions, a nd egoic delusions, such as \"My or our G od is the onl y true God, and your God is false,\" or Niet zsche' s fam ous statement \"God is dead.\" The word God has beco me a closed concept. The mo men t the word is uttered, a mental image is created, no longer, perhaps, of an old m an with a white beard, but still a m ental representation of someone or som ething outside you, and, yes, alm ost inevitably a male some one or something. Neither God nor Being nor any othe r word can define or explain the ineffable reality behind the word, so the only im portant question is whether the word is a help or a hindrance in enabling you to experien ce That toward which it points. Does it 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"point beyond itself to that transcendental reality, or does it lend itself too easily to becom ing no m ore than an idea in your h ead that you believe in, a mental idol? The word Being explains nothi ng, but nor does God. Being, however, has the advantage that it is an open concept. It does not reduce the infini te invisible to a finite entity. It is im possible to form a mental image of it. Nobody can claim exclusive possession of Being. It is your very essence, and it is immediately accessible to you as the feeling of your own presen ce, the realization I am that is prior to I am this or I am that. So it is only a small step from th e word Being to the experience of Being. What is the greatest obstacle to experiencing this reality? Identification with your mind, which causes thought to b ecom e compulsi ve. Not to be able to stop thinking is a dreadful affliction, but we don't realize this becau se alm ost everybody i s sufferi ng from it, so it i s considered norm al. This incessant mental noise prevents you from finding that realm of inner stillness that is inseparable from Bein g. It also creat es a false mind- made self that cas ts a shadow of fear an d suffering. We will look at all th at in m ore detail later. The philosopher Descartes believed that he had found the m ost fundam ental truth when he m ade his fam ous statement: \"I think, therefore I am.\" He had, in fact, given expression to the m ost basic error: to equate thinking with Being and identity with thinki ng. The com pulsive thinker, wh ich m eans alm ost everyone, lives in a state of apparent separateness, in an insanely co mplex worl d of continuous problem s and conflict, a world that reflects the ev er-increasing fragm entation of the m ind. Enlightenment is a state of wholeness, of being \" at one\" and therefore at peace. At one with life in its manifested aspect, the wo rld, as well as wit h your deepest self and life unm anifested - at one with Being. Enlight enm ent is not onl y the end of sufferin g and of continuous c onflict wit hin and w ithout, but also the end of the dreadful enslavement to incessant thinking. What an incredible liberation this is! Identification with your mind creates an opaque screen of concepts, lab els, images, words, j udgments, and definit ions th at blocks all true relationship. It comes between you and yourself, between you and your fellow man and woman, between you and nature, between you and God. It is thi s screen of thought that creates the illusion of separaten ess, the illu sion that there is you and a totally separate \"other.\" You then forget the essential fact that, underneath the level of physical appearances and separate form s, you are one with all that is. By \"for get,\" I mean that you can no longer feel this oneness as se lf-evident re ality. You may be lieve it to be true, but you no longer know it to be true. A belief ma y be com forting. Only through your own experience, however, does it beco me liberating. 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" Thinking has become a di sease. Disease happens when things get out of balance. For exam ple, there is nothing wrong with cells dividing and multiplying in the body, but when this process conti nues in disregard of the tota l organism, cells proliferate and we have disease. Note: The mind is a superb instru ment if used ri ghtly. Used wrongly, however, it becom es very destructive. To put it m ore accurately, it is not so m uch that you use your m ind wrongly - you usual ly don' t use it at all. It uses you. This is the disease. You believe that you are your m ind. This is the delusion. The instrument has taken you over. I don't quite agree. It is true that I do a lot of aimless thinking, like most people, but I can still choose to use my mind to ge t and accomplish things, and I do that all the time. Just because you can solve a crossword puzzle or build an ato m bom b doesn't mean that you use your m ind. Just as dogs lo ve to chew bones, the m ind loves t o get its teeth into problems. That' s why it doe s crossword puzzles and builds at om bom bs. You have no interest in e ither. Let me ask you t his: can you be free of your m ind whenever you want to? Have you found t he \"off\" button? You mean stop thinking altogether? No, I can't, except maybe for a moment or two. Then the mind is using you. Yo u are unconsciously i dentif ied with it, so you don' t even know that you are its slave. It' s alm ost as if you were possessed without knowing i t, and so you take t he possessing entit y to be you rself. The beginning of freedom is the realization that you are not the possessing entity - the thinker. Knowing this enables you to observe the entity. The m oment you start watching the thinker, a higher level of c onsciousness becom es activated. You then begin to realize that there is a vast realm of intelligence beyond thought, that thou ght is only a tiny aspect of that intelligence. Yo u also realize that all the things that truly m atter - beauty, love, creativity, joy, inner peace - arise from beyond the m ind. You begin to awaken. Freeing yourself from your mind What exactly do you mean by \"watching the thinker\"? When someone goes to the doctor and says, \"I hear a voice in m y head,\" he or she will m ost likely be sent to a psychiatrist. The fact is that, in a very sim ilar way, 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"virtually e veryone hears a voice, or several voices, in their head all the time: the invol untary thought processes that you don' t realize you have the power to stop. Continuous m onologues or dialogues. You have probably come across \"m ad\" people in the street incessan tly talking or muttering to them selves. Well, that' s not much different from what you and all other \"norm al\" people do, except that you don' t do it out loud. The voice comments, speculates, judges, com pares , com plains, likes, dislikes , and so on. The voice isn' t necess arily relevant to the situation you find yourself in at the time; it may be reviving the recent or distant past or rehearsing or imagining possible future situations. Here it often imagines things going wrong and ne gative out com es; this is called wor ry. Som etimes this soundtrack is acco mpanied by visual im ages or \"m ental movies.\" Even if the voice is relevant to the situation at hand, it will interpret it in term s of the past. This is because the voice belongs to your c ondit ioned m ind, which is the result of all your past history as well as of the collective cultural m ind-set you inherited. So you see and judge the present through the eyes of the past and get a totally distorted view of it. It is not uncommon for the voice to be a person' s own worst enem y. Many people live with a tormen tor in their head that continuously attacks and punishes them and drains t hem of vital energy. It is the cause of untold misery and unhappi ness, as well as of disease. The good news is that you can free yourself from your m ind. This is the only true libera tion. You can take the first step right now. Start listening to the voice in your head as often as you can. Pay partic ular attention to any repetitive thought patterns, those old gram ophone records that ha ve been playing in your head perhaps for many years. Thi s is what I mean by \"w atching the thinker,\" which is another way of saying: listen to the voice in your head , be there as the witnessing presence. When you listen to that voice, listen to it im partially. That is to say, do not judge. Do not judge or condem n what you h ear, for doing so would mean that the sam e voice has come in again through the back door. You' ll soon realize: there is the voice, and here I am listening to it, watching it. This I am realization, this sense of your own presence, is not a thought. It ari ses from beyond the m ind. So when you listen to a thought, you are aware not only of t he thought but al so of yoursel f as the witness of t he thou ght. A new dimension of consciousness has com e in. As you listen to t he thought, you feel a conscious pr esence - your deeper self - behind or underneath the thought, as it were. The thought then l oses its power over you and quickly subsi des, because you are no longer energizing the m ind through i dentification with it. This is the beginning of the end of i nvoluntary a nd 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"com pulsive thinking. When a thought subsid es, you experience a discontinuity in the mental stream - a gap of \"no-m ind.\" At firs t, the gaps will be short, a few seconds perhaps, but gradually they will becom e longer. When these gaps occur, you feel a certain stillness and peace inside you. This is the beginning of your na tural state of felt oneness with Being, which is usuall y obscure d by the m ind. With practice, the sense of stillness and peace will deepen. In f act, there is no end to its depth. You will also feel a subtle em anation of j oy aris ing from deep within: the joy of Being. It is not a trancelike state. Not at all. There is no loss of consciousness here. The opposite is the case. If the price of peac e were a lowering of your consciousness, and the price of stillness a lack of vitality a nd alertness, then they would not be worth having. In this state of inner connectedne ss, you are m uch m ore alert, m ore awake than in the m ind-identified stat e. You are fully present. It also raises the vibrational frequency of the energy field that gives life to the physical body. As you go more deeply into this realm of no-m ind, as it is som etimes called in the East, you realize the state of pure cons ciousness. In that state, you feel your own presence with such intensity and such j oy that all thinking, all em otions, your physical body, as well as the w hole external world becom e relatively insigni ficant in com parison to i t. And yet thi s is not a self ish but a selfless state. It takes you beyond what you previously thought of as \"your self.\" That presen ce is essentially you and at the sam e time inconceivably greater than you. Wha t I am trying to convey here may sound paradoxical or even contradictory, but there is no other way that I can express it. Instead of \"watching the thinke r,\" you can also create a gap in the mind stream sim ply by directing the focus of your atten tion into the Now. Just become intensely conscious of the present m oment . This is a deeply satisfying thing to do. In this way, you draw consciousness away from m ind ac tivity and create a gap of no-m ind in which you are highly alert and aware but not thinking. This is the essence of meditation. In your e veryday li fe, you can pr actice this by taking any routine activity that norm ally is only a means to an end and givi ng it your full est attention, so that it becom es an end in itself. For exam ple, ev ery time you walk up and down the stairs in your house or place of work, pay close atte ntion to every step, every m ovem ent, even your breathing. Be totally present. Or when you wash your hands, pay attention to all the sense perceptions associat ed with the activity: the sound and feel of the water, the movement of your hands, the scent of the so ap, and so on. Or wh en you get into your car, after you close the door, pause for a fe w seconds and observe the flow of your breath. Beco me awar e of a silent but powerfu l sense of presence. There i s one certain 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"criterion by which you can measure your succe ss in this practice: the degree of peace that you feel within. So the single most vital step on y our journey t oward enlightenm ent is t his: learn to disi dent ify from your m ind. Every time you create a gap in the stream of m ind, the light of your consciousness grows strong er. One day you m ay catch yourself sm iling at the voice in your head, as you would sm ile at the antics of a child. This means that you no longer take the content of your m ind a ll that seriously, as your sense of self does not depend on it. Enlightenment: Rising above Thought Isn't thinking essential in order to survive in this world? Your m ind is an i nstrument, a tool. It is t here to be used for a specific task, and when the task is com pleted, you la y it down. As it is, I would sa y about 80 to 90 percent of most peo ple's thinking is not only repe titive and useless, but because of its dysfunctional and often negative nature, m uch of it is also harm ful. Observe your mind and you will find this to be true. It causes a serious leakage of vital energy. This kind of com pulsive t hinking is actua lly an addiction. What charact erizes an addiction? Quite simply thi s: you no l onger feel that you have the choice to stop. It seem s stronger than you. It also gives you a false sense of pleasure, pleasure that invariably turns into pain. Why should we be addicted to thinking? Because you are ide ntified wit h it, whic h m eans that you derive your sense of self from the content and activity of your m ind. Because you believe that you woul d cease to be if you st opped thi nking. As you grow up, you form a m ental image of w ho you are, based on your personal and cultural condit ioni ng. We may call this phantom self the ego. It consists of m ind activity and can only be kept going t hrough constant thinking. The term ego means different t hings t o di fferent people, but when I use it here it means a fals e self, created by unconscious ident ification with the m ind. To the ego, the present mo ment hardly exis ts. Only past and future are considered im portant. This tota l reversal of the trut h accounts for the fa ct that in t he ego m ode the m ind is so dysfu nctional. It is always con cerned with keeping the past alive, because without it - who are you? It c onstantl y projects itself int o the future to ensure its continued survi val and to seek so me kind of release or ful fillment there. It says: \"One day, when this, th at, or the other happens, I am going to be okay, happy, at 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"peace.\" Even when the ego se em s to be concern ed with the present, it is not the present that it sees: It m isperceives it co mpletely because it looks at it through t he eyes of the past. Or it reduces the present to a means to an end, an end that always lies in the m ind-proj ected future. Observe you r m ind and you' ll see that this is how it works. The present moment hol ds the key to liberation. But you cannot find the prese nt moment as long as you are your m ind. I don't want to lose my ability to anal yze and discriminate. I wouldn't mind learning to think more clearly, in a more focused way, but I don't want to lose my mind. The gift of thought is the most precious thi ng we have. Without it, we would just be anot her species of animal. The predom inance of m ind is no m ore than a stage in the evolution of consciousness. We need to go on to the next stage now as a matter of urgency; otherwise, we will be destroyed by the m ind, which has grown into a monster. I will talk about this in m ore detail later. Thinking and consciousness are not synonym ous. Thinking is onl y a small aspect of consciousness. Thought cannot exist without consci ousness, but consciousness does not need thought. Enlightenment means rising above thought, not falling back to a level below thought, the level of an anim al or a plant. In the enlightened state, you still use your thinking m ind when needed, but in a m uch more focused and effective way t han before. You use it m ostly for practical pu rposes, but you are free of the invol untary internal di alogue, and there is inner stil lness. When you do use your m ind, and particularly when a creative solution is n eeded, you oscillate every few m inutes or so between thought and stillness, between m ind and no-m ind. No-m ind is consciousness without thought. Only in that way is it po ssi ble to think creatively, because only in that way does thought have any real pow er. Thought alone, when it is no longer connected with the mu ch va ster real m of consciousne ss, quickly becomes barren, insane, destructive. The mind is essentially a surviv al machine. Attack an d defense against other minds, gathering, st oring, and analyzing i nform ation - this is what it is good at, but it is not at all creative. All true artists, whether they know it or not, create from a place of no-m ind, from inner stillness. The m ind th en gives form to the creative im pulse or insight. Even the great scientists have re ported that their creati ve breakthroughs cam e at a time of mental quietude . The surpri sing result of a nation-wide inquiry am ong America' s m ost em inent mathematicians, incl uding Einstein, to find out their working methods, was that thinki ng \"plays only a subordi nate part in the br ief, decisive phase 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"of the creative act itself.\"1 So I would say that the sim ple reason why the majority of scientists are not creative is not because they don't know how to think but because they don' t know how to stop thi nking! It wasn' t through the m ind, through thinki ng, that the miracle that is life on earth or your body were created and are being sustained. There is clearly an intelligence at work that is far great er than the mind. How can a single human cell measur ing 1/1,000 of an inch a cross cont ain inst ructi ons withi n its DNA that woul d fil l 1,000 books of 600 pages each? The m ore we learn about the workings of the body, the more we realize just how vast is the in telligence at work within it and how little we know. When the m ind reconnects with that, it becomes a m ost wonderful tool. It then serves something great er than itself. Emotion: The Body's Reaction to Your Mind What about emotions? I get caught up in my emotions more than I do in my mind. Mind, in the way I use the word, is not just thought. It includes your emotions as well as all unconscious mental-emotional re active patt erns. Emo tion arises at the place where mind and body meet. It is the body' s reaction to your m ind - or you m ight say, a reflection of your m ind in the body. For ex ample, an attack thought or a hostile thought will create a build-up of energy in the body that we call anger. The body is getting ready to fight. The thought that you are being threatened, physically or psychol ogically, causes the body to cont ract, a nd this is the physical side of what we call fear. Research has shown that strong em otions even cause changes in t he biochem istry of the body. These biochem ical changes represent the physical or material aspect of the em otion. Of course , you are not usuall y conscious of all your thought pa tterns, and it is often only th rough watching your em otions that you can bring them into awar eness. The more you are identified with your thi nking, your li kes and di slike s, judgm ents and interpretations, which is t o say the l ess present you are as the watching consciousness, the stronger the em otiona l energy charge will be, whether you are aware of it or not. If you cannot feel your em otions, if you are cut off from them, you will eventually experience them on a purely physical level, as a physical problem or sym ptom. A great deal has been written about this in recent years, so we don't need to go int o it here. A strong unconscious e moti onal pattern may even manifest as an external event that appears to just happen to you. For exam ple, I have observed that people who carry a lot of anger insi de without being aware of it and without expressing it are m ore likely t o be attack ed, verbally or even physically, by other 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"angry people, and often for no apparent r eason. They have a strong emanation of anger that certain people pick up subl im inally and that triggers their own latent anger. If you have difficulty feeling your em otions, start by focusing att ention on the inner energy field of your body. Feel the bod y from within. This will also put you in touch with your em otions. We will e xplore this in mo re detail later. You say that an emotion is the mind's reflec tion in the body. But sometimes there is a conflict between the two: the mind says \"no\" while the em otion says \"yes,\" or the other way around. If you really want to know your m ind, the body will always give you a truthful reflection, so look at the em otion or rather feel it in your body. If there is an apparent conflict between them, the thought will be th e lie, the em otion will be the truth. Not the ultim ate truth of who you are, but the re lative truth of your state of m ind at that time. Conflict between surface thoughts and unconscious m ental processes is certainly comm on. You may not yet be able to bring your unconscious m ind activity int o awareness as thoughts, but it w ill always be reflected in the body as an em otion, and of this you can beco me aware. To watch an em otio n in this way is basically the same as listening to or watching a thought, whic h I described earlier. The only difference is that, while a thought is in your head, an em otion has a strong physical com ponent and so is primarily felt in the body. You can th en allow the em otion to be there without being controlled by it. You no longer ar e the em otion; you are the watcher, the observing presence. If you practi ce this, all that is unconsci ous in you will be brought into the light of consciousness. So observing our emotions is as important as observing our t houghts? Yes. Make it a habit to ask yourself: What's going on inside me at this m oment? That question will point you in the right directi on. But don' t analyze, just watch. Focus your attention within. Feel the energy of the em otion. If t here is no em otion present, take your attention m ore deep ly int o the inner energy field of your body. It i s the doorway into Being. An em otion usually represents an am plified and energi zed thought pattern, and because of its often overpowering energetic charge, it is not easy initially to stay present enough to be able to watch it. It wants to ta ke you over, and it usually succeeds - unless there is enough presence in you. If you are pulled int o unconscious identification with the em otio n through l ack of presence, wh ich is norm al, the 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"em otion tem porarily becom es \"you.\" Often a vicious circle bu ilds up between your thinking a nd the em otion: they feed ea ch other. The thought patt ern creates a magnified reflection of itself in the form of an em otion, and th e vibrational frequency of the emotion keeps feeding the original thought pattern . By dwelling mentally on the situation, event, or person that is th e perceived cause of the em otion, the thought feeds energy to the em otion, which in turn energizes the thought pattern, and so on. Basically, all em otions are m odifications of one pri mordial, undifferenti ated em otion that has it s ori gin i n the loss of aw areness of who you are beyond na me and form. Because o f its undifferentia ted nature, it is hard to find a name that precisely describes this em otion. \"Fear\" comes clos e, but apart from a continuous sense of threat, it also includes a d eep sense of abandonm ent and incom pleteness. It m ay be best to use a term that is as undifferentiate d as that basic emotion and sim ply call it \"pain.\" One of the main tasks of the m ind is to fight or rem ove that em otional pain, which is one of the reasons fo r its incessant activity, but all it can ever achieve is to cover it up tem porarily. In fact, the harder th e m ind struggles to get ri d of the pain, the greater the pain. The mind can never find t he solution, nor can it afford to allow you to find the solution, because it is itse lf an intrinsic part of the \"problem .\" Imag ine a chief of police trying to find an arsonist when the arsonist is the chief of police. You will not be fre e of that pain until you cease to derive your sense of self fro m identification with the m ind, which is to say from ego. The m ind is then toppled from its place o f power an d Being reveals itself as your true nature. Yes, I know what you are going to ask. I was going to ask: What about pos itive emotions such as love and joy? They are inseparable from your natural state of inner conn ectedness with Being. Glim pses of love and joy or brief m oment s of deep peace ar e possible whenever a gap occurs in the stream of thought. For m ost people, such gaps happen rarely and only accidentally, in mo ments when the mind is rendered \"s peechless,\" so meti mes triggered by great beauty, extreme physi cal ex ertion, or even great danger. Suddenly, there is inner stillness. And within that stilln ess there is a subtle but intense joy, there is love, there is peace. Usu ally, such mo ments are shor t-lived, as the m ind quickly resumes its noise- making activity t hat we call thinking. Love , joy, and peace cannot fl ouri sh unti l you have freed yourself from m ind dom inance. But they are not what I would call em otions. They lie beyond the em otions, on a m uch deeper level. So you need t o becom e fully conscious of your em otions and be able to feel them before y ou can feel 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"that which lies beyond them . Em otion litera lly m eans \"disturba nce.\" The word comes from the Latin emov ere, meaning \"to dist urb.\" Love, joy, and peac e are deep stat es of Being or ra ther three aspects of the stat e of inner connectedness with Being. As such , they have no opposi te. This is because they arise from beyond the mind. Em otions, on t he other hand, being part of the dualistic m ind, are subject to the law of oppo sites. This sim ply means that you cannot have good without bad. So in the unenli ghtened, m ind-identified condition, what is sometim es wrongl y called joy i s the usua lly short -lived pleasure side of the continuously alternating pain/pleasure cy cle. Pleasure is always derived from something outside you, whereas joy arises from within. The very thi ng that gives you pleasure today will give you pain tom orrow, or it will leave you, so its absence will give you pain. And what is often referred to as love m ay be pleasurable and exciting for a while, but it is an addictive clinging, an extremely needy condition that can turn into its opposite at the flick of a switch. Many \"love\" relationships, afte r the initia l euphoria has passed, actually os cillate between \"love \" and hate, attrac tion and attack. Real love doesn' t make you suffer. How coul d it? It doesn' t suddenly t urn into hat e, nor does real joy turn int o pai n. As I sai d, even before you are enlightened - before you have freed yourself from your m ind - you m ay get glim pses of true j oy, true love, or of a de ep inner peace, still but vibrantly alive. These are aspects of your true nature, which is usually obsc ured by t he m ind. Even w ithin a \"normal\" addictive relationshi p, there can be m oments when the presence of something m ore genuine, something incorruptible, can be felt. But they will only be glim pses, soon to be covered up again through mind interferen ce. It m ay then seem that you had something very precious and lost it, or your m ind may convince you t hat it was all an illusion anyway. The truth is that it wasn' t an illusion, and you cannot lose it. It is part of your na tural state, which can be obscur ed but can never be destroyed by the m ind. Even when the sky is heavily overcast, the sun hasn' t di sappeared. It' s still there on the other side of the clouds. The Buddha says that pain or suffering arises through desi re or craving and that to be free of pain we need to cut the bonds of desire. All cravings are the mind seeking salvation or fulfillment in external things and in the future as a substitute for the joy of Being. As long as I am m y m ind, I am those cravings, those needs, wants, att ach ments, and aversions, and apart from them there is no \"I\" except as a mere possibility, an unfu lfilled potential, a seed that has not yet sprouted. In that state, even my desire to beco me f ree or enlightened is just another craving for fulfillm ent or completion in the future. So don' t seek to becom e free of 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"desire or \"achieve\" enlightenment. Become presen t. Be there as the observer of the mind. Instead of quoting t he Buddha, be the Buddha, be \"the awakened one,\" which is what the word buddha means. Hum ans have been in the grip of pain for eons, ever sin ce they fell from the stat e of grace, entered the realm of time and mind, a nd lost awaren ess of Being. At that point, they started to perceive them selves as me aningless fragments in an alien universe, unconnected to the S ource and to each ot her. Pain is ine vitable as long as you are identifie d with your m ind, which is to say as long as you are unconscious, spi ritually speaking. I am talking here prim arily of em otional pain, which is also the main cause of physi cal pain and physical disease. Resentm ent, hatred, self-pit y, gui lt, ange r, depression, jealousy, and so on, even the slighte st irritation, are all form s of pain. And every pleasure or em otional high contains wit hin itself the seed of pain: its inseparabl e opposite, which will m anifest in time. Anybody who has ever taken dr ugs to get \"high\" will know that the high eventually turns into a low, that the pl easure turns into som e form of pain. Many people also know from their own experience how easily a nd quickly an intim ate relationshi p can turn from a source of pleasure to a sourc e of pain. Seen from a higher perspective, both the negative and the posit ive polarit ies ar e faces of the same coin, are both part of the underlying pain that is insepara ble from the mind-identified egoic state of consciousness. There are two levels to your pai n: the pain that you c reate now, and the pain from the past that still lives on in your m ind and body.

CONSCIOUSNESS: THE WAY OUT OF PAIN Create No More Pa in In The Present Nobody's life is entirely free of pain and so rrow. Isn't it a question of learning to live with them rather than trying to avoid them? The greater part of hum an pain is unnece ssary. It is self created as long as t he unobserved m ind runs your life. The pain that you create now is always some form of non acceptance, some form of unconscious resistance to what is. On the level of thought, the resistance is some form of judgm ent. On the em otional level, it is som e form of negativity. The intensity of the pain depends on the degree of resist ance to the present moment, and this in turn depends on how strongly you are identifi ed with your m ind. The m ind always seeks to deny the Now an d to escap e from it. In other words, the m ore you are identifie d with your m ind, the m ore you suffer. Or you m ay put it l ike this: t he m ore you are able to honor and accept the Now, the more you are free of pain, of suffering - and free of the egoic min d. Why does the m ind habitually deny or resist the Now? Because it cannot function and rem ain in control wi thout tim e, which is pa st and future, so it perceives the timeless Now as threatening. Ti me and mind are i n fact inseparable. Imagine the Earth devoid of human life, inha bited only by plants and ani mals. Would it still have a past an d a future? Could we still speak of time in any mean ingful way ? The question \"What t ime is it?\" or \"What' s th e date t oday?\" - if anybody were there to ask it - would be qui te m eaningless. The oa k tree or the eagle would be bem used by such a question. \"What tim e?\" they would ask. \"Well, of course, it 's now. The time is now. What else is th ere?\" Yes, we need the mi nd as well as time to function in this world, but there co mes a point where they take over our lives, and th is is where dysfunction, pain, and sorrow set in. The m ind, to ensure that it re mains in c ontrol, se eks continuous ly to cover up t he present moment with past and future, and so, as the vitality and infinite creat ive potential of Being, which is inseparable from the Now, becomes covered up by tim e, your true nature becomes obscured by the m ind.

The accu mulation of tim e in the collective and indi vidual hum an m ind also hol ds a vast am ount of residual pain from the past. If you no l onger want to create pain for yourself and othe rs, if you no longer want to add to t he residue of past pain that stil l lives on in you, t hen don' t create any m ore time, or at least no m ore than is necessary to deal with the prac tical aspects of your life. How to stop creating time? Realize deep ly that the present m oment is all you ever have. Make the Now the primary focus of your life. Whereas before you dwelt in time and paid brief visits to the Now, hav e your dw elling place in the Now and pay brief visits to past and future w hen required to deal with the practical aspects of your life situation. Always say \"yes\" to the pr esent m oment. What could be m ore futile, more insane, than to create inn er resistan ce to so mething that already is? What cou ld be m ore insane than t o oppose l ife itself, which is now and always now? Surrende r to what is. Say \"yes\" to life - and see how life suddenly starts working for you rat her than against you. The present moment is sometimes unacceptable, unpleasant, or awful. It is as it is. Observe how the m ind labe ls it and how this la beling process, this continuous sitting in judgm ent, create s pain and unhappiness. By watching the mechanics of the m ind, you st ep out of i ts resistance patterns, a nd you can then allow the present moment to be. This will give you a taste of the state of inner freedom from exter nal conditions, the state of true inner peace. Then s ee what h appens, an d take action if necessary or possi ble.

This will m iraculously transform your whole life. Past Pain: Dissolving The Pain-Body As long as you are unable to access the power of t he Now, every em otional pain t hat you experi ence leaves behind a re sidue of pain that li ves on in you. It m erges with t he pain from the past, which was already th ere, and becom es lodged i n your m ind and body. Thi s, of course, includes the pain you suffered as a child, caused by t he unconsciousness of t he world into which you were born. 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"This accu mulated pain is a negative energy field that occupies your body and m ind. If you look on it as an invisible entity in its own right, you are getting quite close to the truth. Its t he em otional pain-body. It has two m odes of being: dorm ant and active. A pain-body m ay be dorm ant 90 percent of the time; in a deeply unha ppy person, though, it m ay be active up to 100 percen t of the time. Some people live alm ost entirely through their pain-body, while ot hers may experience it only in certain situations, such as intim ate relationshi ps, or sit uations li nked with past loss or abandonment, physi cal or em otional hurt, and so on. Anything can trigger it, particularly if it resonates with a pain pattern from your past. When it is ready to awaken from its dormant stage, even a thought or an innocent remark made by someone close to you can activ ate it. Som e pain-bodies are obnoxi ous but relatively harm less, for exam ple like a child who won' t stop whining. Others are vicious and destruc tive m onsters, true dem ons. Some are physically violent; many more are em oti onally violent. Some will attack people around you or close to you, while others may attack you, their host. Thoughts and feelings you have a bout your life then b ecome deeply negative and sel f-destructi ve. Illnesses and accidents are often created in this way. So me pain-bodies drive their hosts to suicide. When you thought you knew a person and then you are suddenly confronted with t his alien, nasty creature for the first time, you ar e in for quite a shock. However, it' s m ore im portant to observe it in yourself than in som eone else. Watch out for any sign of unhappi ness in yourself, in whatever form - it m ay be the awakening pain-body. Thi s can take the form of irritation, im patience, a somber m ood, a desire t o hurt, anger, rage, depression, a need to ha ve some drama in your relatio nship, and so on. Catch it the mo ment it awak ens fro m its dorm ant state. The pain-body wants to survive, just like ev ery other entity in existence, and it can only survi ve if it gets you to unconsciously id entify with it. It can then rise up, take you over, \"become you,\" and l ive th rough you. It needs to ge t its \"food\" through you. It will feed on any experience that resona tes with its own kind of energy, anything that creat es further pain in whatever form : ang er, destructiveness, hatred, g rief, em otional drama, violence, and even illness. So the pain-body, when it has taken you over, will create a situation in your life that reflects b ack its own energy frequency for it to feed on. Pain can only fe ed on pain. Pain cannot feed on jo y. It finds it quite indi gestibl e. Once the pain-body has take n you over, you want more pain . You become a victim or a perpetrator. You want to infli ct pain, or you want t o suffer pain, or both. There isn' t really m uch difference betwee n the two. You are not consci ous of this, of course, and 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"will vehemently claim that you do not want pain. But look closely and you will find that your t hinki ng and behavior are designed to keep the pain going, for yourself and others. If you were truly consci ous of it, t he pattern would dissolve, for t o want m ore pain is insanity, and nobo dy is consciousl y insane. The pain-body, whi ch is the dark shadow cas t by the ego, is actually afraid of the light of your consciousness. It is afraid of being found out. It s survi val depends on your unconscious identification with it, as well as on your unconscious fear of facing the pain that lives in you. But if you don' t face it, if you don' t bring t he light of your consciousness into the pain, y ou will be forced to relive it again and again. The pain- body may seem to you like a dangerous m onster that you cannot bear to l ook at, but I assure you that it i s an insubsta ntial phant om that cannot prevail against t he power of your presence. Some spiritual teachings state that all pain is ultimately an illusi on, and this is true. The question is: Is it true for you? A m ere belief doesn' t m ake it true. Do you want t o experience pain for the rest of your life and keep saying that it is an illusion? Does that free you from the pain? What we ar e concerned with here is how you can realize this truth - that is, make it real in your own experience. So the pain-body doesn' t want you t o observe it directly and see it for what it is. The moment you observe it, feel its energy fi eld within you, and take your attention i nto it, the identification is broken. A higher dimension of consciousness has come in. I call it presence. You are now the witness or the watc her of the pain-body. This m eans that it cannot use you anym ore by pretending to be you, and it can no longer repleni sh itself through you. You have found your own inne rm ost st rength. You ha ve accessed the power of Now. What happens to the pain-body when we become conscious e nough to break our identification with it? Unconsciousness creates it; consciousness transm utes it into itself. St. Paul expressed this universal principle beautifully: \"Everyth ing is shown up by being exposed t o the light, and whatever is exposed to the light itself becomes light .\" Just as you cannot fight t he darkness, you cannot fight t he pain -body. Trying to do so would create inner conflict and thus furt her pa in. Watching it is enough. Wa tching it im plies accepting it as part of what is at that mo ment. The pain-body consists of trapped life-energy that has split off from your total energy field and has tem porarily become autonom ous through the unnatural process of mind identification. It has turned in on itself a nd beco me anti-life, like an an imal trying to 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"devour its own tail. Why do y ou think our civilization has becom e so life-destructive? But even t he life-destructive forces are sti ll life-energy. When you start to disidentify a nd become the watcher, the pain body will continue to operate for a while and will tr y to trick you into identifyi ng with it again. Although you are no longer energizing it t hrough you r identific ation, it has a certain momentum, just like a spinning wheel th at will keep turning for a while even when it is no longer being pr opelled. At this stage, it m ay also create physical aches and pa ins in di fferent parts of t he body, but they won' t last. Stay present, stay conscious. Be the ever-alert guardian of your i nner space. You need to be present enough to be able to watch the pain-body directly and feel its en ergy. It t hen cannot control your t hinki ng. The m oment your t hinking is aligned with the energy field of the painbody, you are identified with it and again feeding it with your thoughts. For exam ple, if anger is the predom inan t energy vibration of the pain-body and you think angry thoughts, dwelling on what some one did to you or what you are going to do to him or her, then you have becom e unconscious, and the pain-body has become \"you.\" Where there is anger, there is always pain underneath. Or when a dark m ood com es upon you and you start ge tting into a negative m ind-pa ttern and thinking how dreadful your l ife is, your thinking has become aligned with the pain-body, and you have become unconscious a nd vulnerable to the pain-body' s attack. \"Unconscious,\" the way that I use the word here, means to be i dentified with som e mental or emo- tional pattern. It im plies a co mp lete absence of the watch er. Sustained conscious attention severs the link between the painbody and your thought processes and brings about the process of tran sm utation. It is as if the pain becomes fuel for the flame of your consciousness, whic h then burns more brightl y as a result. This is the esoteric meaning of the ancient art of alchemy. the transm utation of base metal into gold, of suffering into consci ousness. The split within is healed, and you becom e whole again. Your responsibility then is not to create further pain. Let me summari ze t he process. Focus attenti on on the feeling insi de you. Know that it is the pain-body. Accept that it is there. Don' t think about it - don' t let the feeling turn into thinking. Don' t judge or analyze. Don' t make an identity for yourself out of it. Stay present, and continue to be the observer of what is happening inside you. Becom e aware not only of the em otional pain but al so of \"t he one who observes,\" the silent watcher. This is the power of the Now, the power of your ow n conscious presence. Then se e what happens. For m any women, the pain-body awakens pa rticularly at the time preceding the menstrual flow. I will talk about this and the reason for it in m ore detail later.

Ego Identification With The Pain-Body The process that I have just described is profoundl y powerful yet simpl e. It could be taught to a child, and hopefully one day it will be one of th e first things children learn in school. Once you have understood t he basi c principle of being present as the watcher of what happens inside you - a nd you \"understand\" it by experiencing it - you have at your di sposal the most potent transform ational tool. This is not to deny t hat you may encounter intense inner resistance to disidenti fying from your pain. This will be the case particul arly if you have lived closely identified with your em otional pain-body for m ost of your life and the whole or a large part of your sense of self is i nvested in it. What this means is that you have made an unhappy self out of your pain- body and believe that this m ind-m ade fiction i s who you are. In that case, unconscious fear of losing your identity will create strong resistance to any disidenti fication. In other words, you would rathe r be in pain – be the pain-body– than take a leap into the unknown and risk losing the fam iliar unhappy self. If this applies to you, observe the resistan ce within yourself. Obse rve the attachment to your pain. Be v ery alert. Observe th e peculiar pleasure you deri ve from being unhappy. Observe the com pulsion to talk or think about it. T he resistance will cease if you m ake it conscious. You can then take your attention into the pain-body, stay present as the witness, and so initiate its transm utation. Only you can do thi s. Nobody can do it for you. B ut if you are fortunate enough t o find som eone who i s intensely conscious, if you can be with them and join t hem in the state of presence, that can be helpful a nd will accel erate things. In this way, your own light will quickly grow st ronger. When a log that has only just started to burn is placed next to one that is burning fiercely, and after a while they are separated again, the first log will be burning with m uch g reater intensity. After all, it is the same fire. To be such a fire is one of the functions of a spiritual teacher. Some th erapists may also be able to fulfill that function, provi ded that they have g one beyond the level of mind and can creat e and sustain a state o f in tense conscious presence while they are working with you. The Origi n Of Fear You mentioned fear as being part of ou r basic unde rlying emotional pai n. How does fear arise, and why is there so much of it in people's lives? And isn't a certain amount 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"of fear just h ealth y self-p rotection? If I didn't have a fear of fire, I might put my hand in it and get burned. The reason why you don' t put your hand in the fi re is not because of fear, it' s because you know that you'll get burned . You don't need fear to a void unneces sary danger - just a m inim um of intelligence and comm on se nse. For such practical matters, it is useful to apply the lessons lear ned in the past. Now if som eone threatened you with fire or wit h physical violence, you m ight experience something li ke fear. This is an instinctive shrinking back from d anger, but not t he psychological conditi on of fear that we are talking about here. The psychol ogical condition of fear is divorced from any concrete and true imme diate danger. It comes in many form s: unease, worry, anxiety, nervousness, tension, dread, phobia, and so on. This kind of psychological fear is always of something that might happen, not of something t hat is happening now. You are in the here and now, while your mind is in the future. This creates an anxiety gap. And if you are i dentified with your mind and ha ve lost touch with the power and simplicity of the Now, that anxiet y gap will be your constant com panion. You can always cope with the present mo ment, but you cannot cope with som ething that is onl y a m ind projection - you cannot cope with the future. Moreover, as long as you are identified with your m ind, the ego runs your li fe, as I pointed out earlier. Because of its phanto m nature, and despite elaborate defense mechanism s, the ego is very vulnerable and in secure, and it sees itself as constantly under t hreat. This, by the way, is the case even if the ego is outwardly very confident. Now remem ber that an em otion is the body' s reaction to your m ind. Wh at mess age is the body receiving continuousl y from the ego, the false, m ind-ma de self? Danger, I am under threat. And what is the em oti on generated by t his continuous m essage? Fear, of co urse. Fear seems to have many causes. Fear of loss, fear of failure, fear of being hurt, and so on, but ultim ately all fear is the ego' s f ear of death, of annihilation. To the ego, death is always just around t he corner. In t his m ind-i dentified state, fear of de ath affects ev ery aspect of your life. For exam ple, even such a se em ing ly trivial and \"norm al\" thing as the com pulsive need to be right in an argument and make the other person wrong - defending the mental position wi th which you have identified - is due to the fear of death. If you identify with a mental position, then if you are wrong, your m ind-based sense of self is seriously th reatened with annihilation. So you as the ego cannot afford t o be wrong. To be wrong is to die. Wars have been fought over this, and countless re lations hips have broken down. Once you have disidentified from your m ind, whether you are right or wrong makes no difference to your sense of self at all, so the forcefully com pulsive and deeply 32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"unconscious need to be right, which is a fo rm of violence, will no longer be there. You can state clearly and firm ly how you f eel or what you think, but the re will be no aggressiveness or defensivene ss about it. Your sense of self is then derived from a deeper and truer place within yourself, not from the m ind. Watch out for any kind of defensiveness within yourself. What ar e you defending? An illusory identity, an image in your m ind, a fictitious entit y. By making thi s pattern conscious, by witnessing it, you di sidentify from it. In the light of your consciousness, the uncon- scious pattern will then quick ly dissolve. This is the e nd of all arguments and power games, which are so corrosive to rela tionships. Power over others is weakness disguised as strength. True power is within, and it is available to you now. So anyone who is identified with their mi nd and, therefore, disconnect ed from their true power, their deeper self rooted in Being, will have fear as their constant com panion. The num ber of people who ha ve gone beyond m ind is as yet extremely small, so you can assume that virtually ever yone you meet or know lives in a state of fear. Only the intensity of it varies. It fluc tuates between anxiety and dread at one end of the scal e and a vague unease and distant se nse of threat at the other. Most people becom e conscious of it only when it ta kes on one of i ts m ore acute form s. The Ego's Search For Wholeness Another aspect of the em otional pain that is an intrinsic part of the egoic mind is a deep-seated sense of lack or incomplet eness, of not being whole. In some people, this is conscious, in othe rs unconsc ious. If it is conscious, it manifests as the unsettling and constant feeling of not being worthy or good e nough. If it is unconscious, it will only be felt indirectly as an intense crav ing, wanting and needing. In either case, people will often enter into a com pulsive pur suit of ego-gratifi cation and things to identify with in order to fill this hole they feel within. So they strive after possessions, money, success, power, recognition, or a speci al relationship, basically so that they can feel better about them selves, feel more com plete. But even when they attain all these things, they soon find that the hole is s till there, that it is bottom less. Then they are really i n trouble, because they cannot de lude them selves anym ore. Well, they can and do, but it gets more difficult. As long as the egoic m ind is running your life, you cannot truly be at eas e; you cannot be at peace or fulf illed except for brief interval s when you obtained what you wanted, when a crav ing has just been fulf illed. Since the ego is a d erived sense o f self, it needs to identify with external thi ngs. It needs to be both defended and fed constantly. The m ost common ego identi fications have to do with possessions, the work you do, social status and recognitio n, knowledge and ed ucation, physical 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"appearance, special abilities, relationships, personal a nd fam ily history, belief system s, and often also politic al, nationalis tic, racial, religious, and other collective identifications. None of these is you. Do you find this fri ghtening? Or is it a relief to know this? All of these things you will have to relinquish sooner or later. Perhaps you find it as yet hard to believe, and I am certainly not aski ng you to believe that your identity cannot be found in any of those things. You will know the truth of it for yourself. Y ou will know it at the latest when you feel death approaching. Death is a stri ppi ng away of all that is not you. The secret of life is to \"die before y ou die\" - and find t hat there is no death. 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"3. MOVING DEEPLY INTO THE NOW Don't Seek Your Self In The Mind I feel that there is sti ll a great deal I n eed to learn about the workings of my mind before I can get anywhere near full consc ious ness or s piritual enlightenment. No, you don' t. The problem s of the m ind cannot be solved on the level of the m ind. Once you have understood the basi c dysfunction, there isn' t really m uch else that you need to le arn or understand. St udyi ng t he com plexities of the m ind m ay make you a good psychologist, but doing so wont take you beyond t he m ind, just as the study of madness isn' t enough to create sanity. Y ou have already understood the basic mechanics of the unconscious state: identif ication with the mind, whi ch creat es a false self, the ego, as a substitute for your tr ue self rooted in Being. You beco me as a \"branch cut off from the vine,\" as Jesus puts it. The ego 's needs are endless. It feels vulnera ble and threatened and so lives in a state of fear and want. Once you know how the basic dysfunction opera tes, there is no need to explore all its countless m anifesta tions, no need to m ake it into a com plex personal problem . The ego, of course, loves that. It is always seeking for som ething to attach itself to in order to uphold and strengthen its illusory sense of self, and it will readily attach itself to your proble ms. This is why, for so many people, a large part of their sense of self is intimately connected with their problems. Once this has happened, the last thi ng they want is tobe come free of them; t hat would mean loss of self. Ther e can b e a g reat deal o f unconsci ous ego investment in pain and suffering. So once you recogni ze the root of unconscious ness as identification wit h the m ind, which of c ourse i ncludes the e motions , you step out of it. You become present. When you are present, you can allow the m ind to be as it is without getting entangled in it. The mind in itself is not dysfunctional. It is a wonderful tool. Dysfunction sets in when you seek your self in it and m istake it for who you are. It then becom es the egoic mind and takes over your whole life.

To be identified wit h your m ind is t o be trapped in tim e: the compul sion t o live alm ost exclusively through mem ory and anticipation. This creates an endless preoccupation with past and future and an unwillingness to honor and acknowledge the resent m oment and allow it to be. The co mpulsion arises because th e past gives you an identity and the future holds the pr om ise of salvation, of fulfillm ent in whatever form . Both are illusions. But without a sense of time, how would we function in this world? There would be no goals to strive toward anymore. I wouldn' t even know who I am, because my past makes me who I am today. I think time is something very precious, and we need to learn to use it wisely rather than waste it. Tim e isn 't precious at all, because it is an illusion. What you perceive as precious is not tim e but the one point t hat is out of ti me: the Now. That is precious indeed. The more you are focused on tim e - past and future - the m ore you m iss the Now, the most preci ous thing there is. W hy is it the most precious thing? Firstly, because it is the only thing. It's all there is. The eternal present is the space within which your whole life unfol ds, the one fact or that remains con stant. Li fe is now.

It is your only point of access into the ti mel ess and formless real m of Being. Nothing Exists Outside The Now Aren't past and future just as real, sometimes even more real, than the present?

The Key To Th e S piritual Dimension In life-threat ening emergency situations, the shift in consciousness from time to presence sometim es happens naturally. The pe rsonality that has a past and a future mo mentari ly recedes and is replaced by an intense conscious presence, very still but very alert at the same time. Whatever response is needed then arises out of that state of consciousness. The reason why some people love to enga ge in dangerous activi ties, such as mountain clim bing, car racing, and so on, a lthough they m ay not be a ware of it, is that it forc es them in to the Now - that intens ely alive state th at is free o f time, free of problem s, free of thinking, free of the burde n of the personalit y.

Since anci ent times, spiritual masters of all traditions have poi nted to the Now as the key to the spiritual dimension. Despite this, it seem s to have rem ained a secret. It is certainly not taught i n churches and temp les. If you go t o a church, you may hear readings from the Gospels such as \"Take no thought fo r the morrow; for the m orrow shall take thought for the things of itself, \" or \"Nobody who puts his hands to the plow and looks back is fit for the Kingdom of God.\" Or you m ight hear the passage about the beautiful flowers that are not anxiou s about tom orrow but live with ease in the timeless Now and are provided for abundantly by God. The depth and radical nature of these teachings are not recognized. No one seem s to reali ze that they are meant to be lived and so bring about a profound i nner transform ation. Th e whole essence of Zen consists in walking along the razor' s edge of Now - to be so utterl y, so completely present that no problem , no suffering, nothing that is not who you are in your esse nce, can survive in you.

There is no greater obstacle to God than time.\" Accessing The Po wer Of The No w A moment ago, when you talk ed about the et ernal present and the unreality of past and f uture , I found myself looking at that tree outside the window. I had l ooked at it a few times before, but this time it was different. The external perception had not changed much, except that the colors seem ed brighter and more vibrant. But there was now an added dimension to it. This is hard t o explain. I don't know how, but 1 was aware of something i nvisi ble that I fe lt was the essence of that tree, its inner spirit, i f you like. And somehow I was part of that. I reali ze. now that I hadn' t truly seen the tree before, just a f lat and dead image of it. When I l ook at the tree now, some of that awareness is still present, b ut I can feel it slipping away. You see, the experi ence is already receding into the pa st. Can something l ike this ever be more than a fleeting glimpse? You were free of t ime for a m oment. You m oved into t he Now and therefore perceived the tree without the screen of mind. The awaren ess of Being became part of your perception. Wi th the tim eless dim ension com es a different kind of knowing, one that does not \"kill\" the spirit that lives w ithin every creature and ev ery thing. A knowing t hat does not destroy the sacredness and m ystery of life but contains a deep love and reverence for all that is. A knowing of which the m ind knows nothing. The m ind cannot know the tre e. It can only know facts or i nformation about the tree . My m ind cannot know you, only labels , judgments, facts, and opinions about y ou. Being alone knows directly. There is a place for m ind and m ind knowledge. It is in the practical real m of day-to- day living.

What is needed and what we are concerned with is a permanent shift i n consciousness. So break the old pattern of present-m oment denial and present m oment resistance. Make it your practice to withdraw attention from past and fut ure whenever they are not needed. Step out of the time dimension as much as possible in everyday life. If you fi nd it hard to enter the Now directly, start by observing t he habitual tendency of your m ind to want to escape from the Now. You will observe that the future is usually imagined as either be tter or worse than the present. If the im agined future is better, it gives you hope or pl easurable anticipation. If it is worse, it creates anxiety. Both are illusory. Through self-observation, m ore presence comes into your l ife automatically. The m oment you realize you are not present, you are pre sent. Whenever you are able to observe your m ind, you are no longer trapped i n it. Anot her factor has co me in, something that is not of the m ind: the witnessing presence. Be present as the watcher of your m ind - of your t houghts a nd em otions as well as your react ions in va rious situa tions. Be at leas t as interested in your reactions as in the situation or person that causes you to react. Notice also how often your attention is in the past or future. Don' t judge or analyze what you observe. Watch the thought, feel the emotion, observe the reaction. D on' t make a personal pr oblem out of them. You will then feel something m ore powerfu l than any of those things that you observe: the still, observing presence itself behi nd the content of your mind, the silent watch er. Intense presence is needed when certain situations trigger a reaction with a strong emotional charge, such as when your self-image is t hreat ened, a challenge co mes into your l ife that triggers fear, things \"go wr ong,\" or an em otional com plex from the past is brought up. In those instances, the te ndency is for you t o become \"unconscious.\" The reaction or em otion takes you over - you \"become\" it. You act it out . You justi fy, make wro ng, attack, defend ... except that it isn't you, it's the reactive pattern, the mind in its habitual survival m ode. Identification with the m ind gives it m ore energy; observation of the mind withdraws energy from it. Identification with the m ind creates m ore time; observation of the mind opens up t he di mension of the tim eless. The energy that is withdra wn from the mind turns into presence.

Letting Go Of Psychological Time Learn to use time in the practi cal aspects of your life - we may call this \"clock time\" - but immediately return to pre sent-m oment awareness when those practical matter s have been dealt with. In this way, there will be no build-up of \"psychological time,\" which is identification with the past and continuous com pulsive projection int o the future. Clock time is not just m aking an appoint ment or pl anning a t rip. It incl udes learning from the past so that we don' t repeat the sam e m istakes over and over. Setting goals and working toward them . Predicting the future by means of patterns and laws, physical, mathem atical and so on, learned fr om the past and t aking appropriate action on the basis of our predictions. But even here, within the sphere of pra ctical living, where we cannot do wit hout reference to past and future, the present moment rem ains the essential factor: Any lesson from the past becomes relevant and is appli ed now. Any planni ng as well as working t oward achieving a particular goal is done now. The enlightened persons m ain focus of atten tion is a lways the Now, but they are still peripherally aware of time. In other words, they continue to use clock time but are free of psychological time. Be alert as you practice this so that you do not unwittingly tra nsform clock time into psychol ogical time. For exam ple, if you made a m istake in the pa st and learn from it now, you are using clock time. On the other hand, if you dwell on it mentally, and self-criticism, rem orse, or guilt come up, then you a re making the m istake into \"me\" and \"m ine\": you m ake it part of your sense of self, and it has b ecom e psychol ogical time, which is always linked to a false se nse of ide ntity. Non-forgiveness necessarily im plies a heavy burden of psychological time. If you set yourself a goal and work toward it, you are using clock time.

Superfic ial changes are possi ble, but real transform ation is rare and depends upon whether you can becom e present enough to dissol ve the past by accessing the power of the Now. What you perceive as future is an intrinsi c part of your state of cons ciousness now. If your m ind carries a heavy burden of past, you will expe rience m ore of the sam e.

What I call ordinary unconsciousness m eans being identified with your thought processes and em otions, your react ions, desires, and av ersions. It is most people's normal state. In that sta te, you are run by the egoic m ind, and you are unaware of Being. It is a state not of acute pain or unhappiness but of an alm ost con tinuous low level of unease, discontent, boredom , or nervousness - a kind of background static. You m ay not realize this because it is so m uch a part of \"norm al\" living, just as you are not awar e of a con- tinuous low background noise, such as the hum of an air conditioner, until it stops. When it suddenly does stop, there is a sense of relief. Many people use alcohol, drugs, sex, food, work, televisi on, or even shopping as anesthetic s in a n unconscious attem pt to rem ove the basic un ease. When this happens, an activity that m ight be very enjoyable if used i n m oderation becomes im bued with a com pulsive or addict ive quality, and all that is ever achieved through it is e xtremely short-lived symptom relie f.

You can use a challenge to awaken you, or you can allow it to pull you into even deeper sl eep. The dre am of ordi nary unconsciousne ss the n turns into a nightm are. If you cannot be present even in norm al ci rcum stances, such as when you are sit ting alone in a room , walking in the woods, or listening to som eone, then you certainly won' t be able to stay conscious when so mething \"goes wrong\" or you are faced with difficult people or situations, with loss or the threat of loss. Y ou will be taken over by a reaction, which ultimately is always so me form of fear, and pulled into deep unconsciousness. Those challenges are your tests. Only the way in which you deal with them will show you and others wher e you are at as far as your state of consciousness is concerned, not how long you can sit with your eyes closed or what visions you see. So it is essential to bring more consciousness i nto your life in ordinary situations when everything i s going relatively sm oothl y. In t his way, you grow in presence power. It generates an energy field in you and a round you of a high vibrational frequency. No unconsciousness, no negativity, no di scord or violence can enter that field and survive, just as darkness ca nnot survive in t he presence of light. When you learn to be the witness of your thoughts and em otions, which is an essential part of being pres ent, you m ay be surprised when you first become aware of the background \"stat ic\" of ordi nary unconsci ousness and realize how rarely, if ever, you are truly at ease within yourself. On th e level of your thi nking, you will find a great deal of resistance in the form of j udgm ent, discontent, and m ental projection away from the Now. On the em otional level, there will be an undercurrent of unease, tension, boredom , or nervousness. Both are aspects of the mind in its habitual resistance mode. What Are They S eeking? Carl Jung tells in one of his books of a c onversation he had with a Native American chief who pointed out to him that in hi s perception m ost white people have tense faces , staring eyes, and a cruel demeanor . He said: \"They are al ways seeking 51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"something. What ar e they s eeking? The whites always wan t something. They are always uneasy and restless. We don' t know wh at they want. We th ink they are mad.\" The undercurrent of constant unease started long before the ri se of Western indust rial civilization, of course, but in Western ci vilization, which now covers alm ost the entire globe, including m ost of the Eas t, it manifests in an unprecedentedly acute form . It was already there at the time of Je sus, and i t was there 600 years before t hat at the time of Buddha, and long before that. Why are you always anxious? Jesus asked his disciples. \"Can anxious thought add a single day to your life?\" And the Buddha taught t hat the root of suffering is to be found in our constant wanting and craving. Resistance to the Now as a coll ective dysfunc tion is intrinsically connected to loss of awareness of Being and form s the basis of our dehumanized industrial civilization. Freud, by the way, also recognized the exis tence of this underc urrent of unease and wrote about it in hi s book Civilization and Its Discontents, but he did not recognize the true root of t he unease and failed to rea lize that freedom from it is possible. This collective dysfuncti on has c reated a very unhappy and extraordinarily vi olent civilization that has becom e a threat not only to itself but also to all life on the planet. Dissolving Ordinary Unconsciousness So how can we be free of this affliction? Make it conscious. Observe the many ways in which unease, discontent, and tension arise within you through unnecessary judgment , res istance to what is, and denial of the Now. Anything unconscious dissolves wh en you shi ne t he light of consciousness on it. Once you know how to dissol ve ordinary unconsciousness, th e l ight of your presence will shine brightly, and it will be m uch easier to deal with deep unconsciousness whenever you feel its gravitational pull. However, ordinary unconsciou sness may not be easy to detect initially because it is so norm al. Make it a habit to monitor your m ental-em otional state through self-observation. `Am I at ease at this m oment?\" is a good qu estion to ask yourself frequentl y. Or you can ask: \"What' s going on insi de me at this m oment?\" Be at least as interested in what goes on i nside you a s what happens outside. If you get the inside right, the outsi de will fall i nto place. Primary reality is w ithin, secondary reality wit hout. But don't answer these questions immedi ately. Direct your attention inward. Have a look insi de yourself. What kind of thoughts is your mind producing? What do you feel? Direct your attent ion int o the body. Is there any te nsion? Once you detect that there is a low level of unease, the background static, see in what way you are avoiding, resisting, or 52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"denying l ife - by denying t he Now.

With practice, your power of self-observation, of m onitoring your inner state, will become sharpened. Freedom From Unhappiness Do you resent doi ng what you are doing? It may be your job, or you m ay have agreed to do som ething and are doing it, but pa rt of you resents a nd resists i t. Are you carrying unspoken resentm ent toward a pe rson close to you? Do you realize that the energy you thus em anate is so harm ful in its effects that you are in fact contam inating yourself as well as those around you? Have a good look inside. Is there even the slightest trace of resentment, unwillingness? If there is, observe it on both the mental and the em otional levels. What thought s is your m ind creating around this situat ion? Then look at the emotion, whi ch is the body' s reaction to those thoughts. Feel the emotion. Does it feel pleasant or unpleasant? Is it an energy that you would actually choose to have inside you? Do you have a choice? Maybe you are being taken advantage of, m aybe the activity you are engaged in is tedious, m aybe someone close to you i s dish onest, irritating, or unconscious, but all this is irrelevant. Whether your thoughts and em otions about thi s situation are justified or not m akes no difference. The fact is that you are resisting what is. You are mak ing the present mo ment into an enem y. You are creating unhappi ness, conflict between the inner and the out er. Your unha ppiness is poll uting not only your own inner being and those around y ou but also the colle ctive hum an psyche of which you are an inseparable part. The pol lution of t he planet is onl y an outward reflection of an inner psyc hic pollution: m illions of unconsci ous individuals not taking responsibility for their inner space. Either stop doing what you are doing, speak to the person concerned and express fully what you feel, or drop t he negativ ity t hat your m ind has created around the situation and that serves no purpose whatso ever except to strengthen a false sense of self. Recognizing its futil ity i s im portant. Negativity is never the optim um way of dealing with any situation. In fact, in m ost cases it keeps you st uck in it, blocking re al change. Anything that is done with negative energy will become contam inated by it and in ti me give rise to m ore pain, mo re unhappiness. Furthe rm ore, any negative inner state is contagi ous: Unhappiness spr eads m ore easily than a physi cal disease. Through t he law of resonance, it tri ggers a nd feeds latent negativity i n others, unl ess they are immune - that is, highly conscious. 53"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Are you polluti ng the world or cleaning up th e m ess? You are responsible for your inner space; nobody else is, jus t as you are re sponsible for the planet. As within, so without: If hum ans clear inner pollution, then they will also cease to create outer pollution. How can we drop negativity, as you suggest? By dropping it. How do you drop a piece of hot coal that you are holding in your hand? How do you drop som e heavy and usel ess baggage that you are carrying? By recognizing that you don' t want to suffer the pain or carry the burden anym ore and then letting go of it. Deep unconsciousness, such as the pain-body, or ot her deep pain, such as the loss of a loved one, usually needs to be transm uted through acceptance co mbin ed with the light of your presence - your sustained attention. Many patterns in ordinary unconsciousness, on the other hand, can sim ply be dropped once you know that you don' t want them and don' t need them an ym ore, once you realize that you have a choice, that you are not just a bundle of c ondit ioned reflexes. All this implies that you are able to access the power of No w. Without it, you have no choice. If you call some emotions negative, ar en' t you creat ing a ment al polar ity of good and bad, as y ou expl ained ear lie r? No. The polarity was created at an earlier st age when your m ind judged the present moment as bad; this judgm ent then created the negative em otion. But if you call some emotions negative, aren't you really saying that they shoul dn't be there, that it's not okay to have those em otions? M y understanding is that we should give ourselves per mission to have whatever f eelings come up, rather than judge them as bad or say that we shouldn' t have them. It's ok ay to feel resentful; it's okay to be angry, irritated, moody, or whatever - ot herwise, we g et into repression, inner conflict, or denial. Everything is okay as it is. Of course. Once a mind pattern, an em otion or a reaction is there, accept it. You were not consci ous enough to have a choice in the mat ter. That 's not a judgment, just a fact. If you had a choice, or realized that you do have a choice, would you choose suffering or joy, ease or unease, peace or conflict? Would you choose a thought or feeling tha t cuts you off from your natural state of well-be ing, the joy of life within? Any such feeling 1 call negativ e, which sim ply means bad. Not in the sense that \"You shoul dn' t have done that\" but just plain factua l bad, like feeling sick in the stomach. 54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"How is it possible that humans killed in excess of 100 m illion fellow humans in the twentieth century alone?

Com ing back specifically to what you sa id - it is certainly true that, when you accept your resentment, m oodiness, a nger, and so on, you are no longer forced to act them out bli ndl y, and you are less likely to pr oject them onto others. But I wonder if you are not deceiv ing yourself. When you ha ve b een practicing acceptance f or a while, as you have, there comes a point when you need to go on to the next stage, where those negative em otions are not created anymor e. If you don' t, your \"acceptance\" just becom es a mental label that allows your ego to continue t o indul ge in unhappi ness and so strengthen its sense of separation from other peopl e, your surroundings, your here and now. As you know, separation is t he basis for the ego' s sense of identi ty. True acceptance would transm ute those feelings at once. And if you really knew deeply that everythi ng is \"oka y,\" as you put it, and which of course is true, then would you have those negative feelings i n the first place? Without judgment, without resistance to what is, they would not ar ise. You have an idea in your m ind that \"everything is okay,\" but deep down you don' t really believe it, and so t he old m ental- em otional patterns of resistance are still in place. That' s what makes you feel bad. That's okay, too. Are you defending your right t o be unconsci ous, your right t o suffer? Don' t worry: nobody i s going to t ake that away from you.

To complain is always non-acceptance of what is. It invariably carries an unconscious negativ e charge. When you com plain, you make yourself i nto a victim. When you speak out , you are in your power. So change the situation by taki ng action or by speaking out if necessary or possible; leave the situation or accept it. All else is m adness. Ordinary unconsciousness is always linked in some way with denial of the Now. The Now, of course, also im plies the here. Ar e you resisting your here and now? Some people would always rather be somewhere else. Their \"here\" is never good enough. Through selfobservation, fi nd out i f that is the case in your life. Wherever you are, be there totally. If you find your here and now intole rable and it makes you unhappy, you have three options: rem ove yourself from the situation, change it, or accep t it totally. If you want to take responsibility fo r your life, you must choose one of those three options, and you m ust choose now. Then accept the consequences. No excuses. No negativity. No psychic poll ution. Keep your i nner space clear. If you take any action - leaving or changing your si tuation - drop t he negativity first, if at all possible. Action arising out of insi ght into what is required is m ore effective than action arising out of negativity. Any action is often better than no action, es pecially if you have been stuck in an unhappy situation for a long ti me. If it is a m istake, at least you learn something, in which case it' s no longer a mistake. If you rem ain stuck, you learn nothing. Is fear preventing you from taking action? Acknowle dge the fear, watch it, take your attention into it, be fully present with it. Doing so cuts the link between the fear and your thinking. Don't let the fear rise up into your mind. Use the power of the No w. Fear cannot prevail against it. If there is truly nothi ng that you can do to change your here and now, and you can' t rem ove yourself from the situation, then accept your here and now totally by dropping all inner resistance. The false, unhappy self that l ove s feeling m iserable, resentful, or sorry for itself can then no longer survive. This is called surrender. Surrender is not weakness. There is great strengt h in it. Only a surrendered person has spiritual power. Through surrender, you will be free inte rnally of the situation. You may then find t hat the situation changes without any effort on your part. In any case, you are free. Or is there something that you \"should\" be doing but are not doing it?

This greatly reduces the qua lity of your life by making you lose the present. There is nothing wrong with striving t o improve your life situation. You can im prove your l ife situation, but you cannot im prove your life. Life is prim ary. Life is your deepest in ner Being. It is alr eady who le, co mplete, perfect. Your life situation consists of your circum stances and your experiences. There is nothi ng wrong with setting goals and stri ving to ach ieve things. The m istake lies in using it as a substitute for the feeling of li fe, for Being. The only poi nt of access for that is the Now. You are then like a n architect who pays no attentio n to the foundation of a bui lding but spends a lot of time working on the superstructure. For example, many people are waiting for pros perity.

The Inner Purpose Of Your Life's Journey I can see the truth of what you are saying, but I still think that we must have purpose on our life 's journey, otherwise we just drift, and purpose means future, doesn't it? How do we reconcile that with living in the present? When you are on a journey, it is certainly helpful t o know where you are going or at least the general direction in w hich you a re m oving, but don' t forget: t he only thi ng that is ult imately real about your j ourney is the step that you are taking at this mo ment. That 's all t here ev er is. Your life' s journey has an outer purpose and an inner purpose. The outer purpose is to arrive at your goal or destinati on, to accomplish w hat you se t out t o do, to achieve this or that, which, of course, im plies futu re. But if your desti nation, or the steps you are going to take in the future, take up so much of your attention that they become more im portant t o you than the step you are taking now, then you com pletely m iss the journey' s inner purpose, which has nothing t o do wit h where yo u are going or what you are doing, but everything to do with how. It has nothing to do with future but everything to do with the quality of your consciousness at this m oment. The ou ter purpose belongs to the horizontal dim ension of space and time; the i nner purpose concerns a deepening of your Being in th e vertical dimension of the ti meless Now. 59"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Your outer journey may contain a m illion st eps; your inner jour ney only has one: the step you a re taking right now.

This one step then beco mes tran sform ed int o an e xpression of perfecti on, an act of great beauty and quality. It will have taken you into Bei ng, and the light of Being will shine through it. This is both the purpose and the fulfillm ent of your inner journey, the journey into yourself. Does it matter whether we achieve our outer pu rpose, whether we succeed or fail in the world? It will m atter to you as l ong as you haven't realized your inner purpose. After that, the outer purpose is j ust a gam e that you m ay co ntinue to play si mply because you enj oy it.

The Past Cannot Surviv e In Your Pres ence You mentioned that thinking or talking about the past un necessarily is one of the ways in which we avoid the present. But apart f rom the past that we remember and perhaps identify with, isn't there another leve l of past within us that is much more deep-seated? I am talking about the unconscious past that conditions our lives, especially through e arly childhood experie nces, p erhaps even past-life experien ces. And then there is our cultural conditioni ng, which has to do with where we live geographi cally and the hist orical time peri od in which we live. All these things determine how we see the world, how we react, what we think, what kind of relationshi ps we have, how we live our lives . Ho w could we ever become conscious of all that or get rid of it? How long would that take? And even if we did, what would there be left? What is left when illusion ends?

Only the present can free you of the past. More time cannot fr ee you of time. Access the po wer of Now. That is the key. What is the power of Now?

If you can be present enough to watch all those things, not criti cally or analytically but nonj udgm entally, then you are dealing with the past and di ssolvi ng it through t he power of your presence. You cannot find yourself by going into the past. You find yourself by com ing into the present. Isn't it hel pful to understand t he past an d so understand why we do certain t hings, react in certain ways, or why we unconsciously create our part icular kind of dram a, patterns in relationships, and so on? As you becom e m ore conscious of your pr esent reality, you may suddenl y get certain insights as to why your conditi oning functi ons in those particular ways; for example, why your relationshi ps follow certain patte rns, and you may remem ber things t hat happened in the past or see them m ore clearly . That is fine and can be helpful, but it is not essential. What is esse ntial is your conscious presence. That dissolves the past. That is the transformative agent.

Je sus used the analogy of waiting in some of his parables. This is not the usual bored or restless kind of waiting that is a denial of t he present and that I spoke about already. It is not a waiting in which your attention is focused on som e point in the future and the present is perceived as an undesirable obstacle th at prevents you from having what you want. There is a qualitatively different kind of waiting, one that requires your tota l alertness. Som ething could happen at any moment, and if you are not absolutely awake, absolutely still, you w ill m iss it. This is the kind of w aiting Jesus talks about. In that sta te, all your attention is in the Now. There is none left for daydream ing, thinking, rem embering, anticipating. There is no tension i n it, no fear, just alert presence. You are present with your whole Being, with every cell of your body. In that state, the \"you' that has a past and a future, the personality if you like, is hardly there anym ore. And yet nothing of value is lost. You are s till essentially yourself. In fact, you are m ore fully yoursel f than you ever were before, or rather it is only now that you are truly yourself. \"Be like a servant waiting for the return of the master,\" says Jesus. The servant does not know at what hour the m aster is going to com e. So he sta ys awake, alert, poised, still, lest he m iss th e master' s arrival. In another parable, Jesus speaks of the five careless (unconscious) women who do not have enough oil (consciousness) to keep their lam ps burni ng (stay present) and so miss the bridegroom (the Now) and don' t get to the wedding feast (enlightenment). These five stand in contrast to the five wise wom en who have enough o il (stay conscious). Even the men who wrote the Gospels di d not understand the m eaning of t hese parables, so the first m isinterpretations a nd distortions crept in as they were written down. Wit h subsequent erroneous i nterpre tations, the real meaning was complet ely lost. These are parables not about the end of the world but about the end of psychol ogical time. They point to the transcendence of the egoic m ind and the possibility of living in an entir ely new state of consciousness. Beauty Arises In The St illness Of Your Presence What you have just described is somethi ng that I occasional ly experience for brief moments when I am alone and surrounded by nature. Yes. Zen masters use the word 63"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"satori to describe a flash of insight, a m oment of no-m ind and tot al presence. Although satori is not a lasting transformation, be gr ateful when it comes, for it gives you a taste of enlight enm ent. You may, ind eed, have experienced it m any times with- out knowi ng what. i t is and realizing its im portance. Presence is needed to become aware of the beauty, the m ajesty, the sa credness of nature. Ha ve you ever gazed up into the infinity of space on a clear night, Yes, but only as seen from the li mited perspective of the manifested universe. In the Bible, God declares: \"I am th e Al pha and the Omega, and I am the living One.\" In the timeless realm wh ere God dwells, which is also your home, the beginning a nd the end, the Alpha and the Omega, are one, and the essence of everyt hing that ever has been and ever will be is eternally present in an unmanifested state of onene ss and perfection - to tally beyond anythi ng the human mind can ever i magin e or comprehend. In our wo rld of seem ingly separate form s, however, timeless perfection i s an inconceivable concept. Here ev en consciousness, which is the light emanati ng from the eternal Source, seem s to be subject to a process of development, but this is due to our lim ited perception. It is not so in absolute term s. Nevert heless, let me continue t o speak for a m oment about t he evolution of consciousness in t his world. Everything that exists has Being, ha s God-essence, has som e degree of consciousness. Even a stone has rudimentar y consciousness; otherwise, it would not be, and its atom s and m olecules would disper se. Everything is alive. The sun, the earth, plants, animals, human s - all are e xpressions of consciousness in varyi ng degrees, consciousness ma nifesting as form. The world arises when consciousness takes on shapes and form s, thought form s and material form s. Loo k at the millions of life form s on this pla net alone. In the sea, on land, in the air - and then each life form is replicated millions of times. To what end? Is som eone or som ething playi ng a gam e, a ga me with form ? This is what the ancient seers of India asked them selves. They saw the world as lila, a kind of divine ga me that God is playing. The individual life form s are obviously not very important in this gam e. In the sea, most life form s don' t su rvi ve for m ore than a few m inutes after being born. The human form turns to dust pr etty qui ckly too, and when it is gone it is as if it had never be en. Is that tragic or cruel? Only if you cr eate a separate identity for each f orm , if you forget that its consci ousness is God-essence expressing itself in form . But you don' t truly know that until you realize your own God-essence as pure consciousness. Awestruck by the absolute sti llness and inconceivable vastness of' it? Have you listened, truly listened, to th e sound of a m ountain stream in the forest? Or to the song of a blackbird at dusk on a quiet summer even ing? To beco me awar e of such things, 64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"the m ind needs to be still. You have to put down for a m oment your personal baggage of problem s, of past and future, as we ll as all your knowledge; otherwise, you wi ll see but not see, hear but not he ar. Your total presence is required. Beyond the beauty of the external form s, ther e is more here: something t hat cannot be nam ed, something ineffable, some deep, i nner, holy essence. Whenever and wherever there is beauty, this inner essence shines through somehow. It onl y reveals itself t o you when you are present. Could it be that this nameless essence and your presence are one and the same? Would it be there wit hout your presence? Go deeply into it. Find out for yourself. When you experienced those m oments of pr esence, you li kely di dn' t realize that you were briefly in a state of no-m ind. This is because the gap betwee n that state and the influx of t hought was too narrow. Your sato ri m ay only have last ed for a few seconds before the m ind came in, but it was there; otherwise, you woul d not have experienced the beauty. Mind can neither recognize nor create beauty. Only for a few seconds, while you were completely pres ent, was that beauty or t hat sacredness there. Because of the narrowness of that gap a nd a lack of vigilance and alertn ess on your part, you were probably unable to see the fundam ental difference between the perception, the thought-less awaren ess of beauty, and the nam ing and interpreti ng of it as thought : The time gap was so small that it seemed to be a single process. The truth is, however, that the m oment thought came in, all you had was a mem ory of it. The wider the time gap between perception a nd t hought, the m ore depth there is to you as a human being, which is to say the m ore conscious you are. Many people are so im prisoned in their m inds that the beauty of na ture does not really exist for them. Th ey might say , \"W hat a pretty fl ower,\" but that' s just a mechanical m ental labeling. Because they ar e not still, not present, they don' t truly see the flower, don' t feel its essence, its ho liness - j ust as they don' t know them selves, don' t feel their own essence, their own hol iness. Because we live in such a mind-dom inated culture, m ost modern ar t, architect ure, music, and literature are devoid of beauty, of inner essence, with very few exceptions. The reason is that the people who create t hose things cannot - even for a m oment - free themselves from their mind. So they ar e never in touch with that place with in where true creativity and beaut y arise. The mind left to itself creates m onstrosities, and not only in art galleries. Look at our ur ban landscapes and in dustrial wastelands. No civilization has ever produc ed so m uch ugliness. Realiz ing Pure Consciousness Is presence the same as Being? 65"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"When you become conscious of Being, wh at is really happening is that Being beco mes conscious of itself. When Bei ng becomes con scious of itself - that's presence. Since Being, consciousness, a nd life are synonymous, we could say t hat presence means co nsciousness b eco ming conscious of itself, or life attaining self- consciousness. But don' t get attached to th e words, and don' t make an effort to understand this. There is nothi ng that you need to understand before you can become present. I do understand what you just said, but it seems to imply that Being, the ultimate transcendental real ity, is not yet comple te, that it is undergoing a process of development. Does God need time for per sonal growth? If a fish is born in your aquarium and you ca ll it John, write out a birth certificate, tell him about his fam ily hist ory, and two m inut es later he gets eaten by another fish - that's tragic. But it's only tr agic becaus e you projected a se parate self where there was none. You got hol d of a fraction of a dynam ic process, a m olecular dance, and made a separate entity out of it. Consciousness takes on th e disguise of forms until they r each such comp lexity that it completely loses itself in them. In presen t-day humans, consciousness is com pletely identified with its disguise. It only knows itsel f as form and therefor e lives in fear of the annihil ation of i ts physical or psychologi cal form. This is the egoic m ind, and thi s is where considerabl e dysfunction sets in. It now looks as if something had gone very wrong somewhere along the l ine of evol ution. Bu t even this i s part of li la, the divine gam e. Finally, the pressure of sufferi ng cr eated by this appa rent dysfunction forces consciousness to di sidentify from form and awak ens it from its dream of form: It regains self-consciousness, but it is at a far deeper level than when it lost it. This process is explained by Jesus in his parable of the lost son, who leaves his father' s home, squan ders his wealth, beco mes destitute, and is then forced by his suffering to return home. When he does, his father loves him more than before. The sons state is the same as it was before, yet not the same. It has an added dim ension of depth. The parable describes a journey fr om unconscious perfe cti on, through apparent im perfection and \"evil\" to conscious perfection. Can you now see the deeper and wider si gnificance of becom ing present as the watcher of your m ind? Whenever you watc h the mind, you withdraw consciousness from m ind form s, which then becomes what we call the watcher or the witness. Consequently, the watcher - pure conscious ness beyond form - becomes stronger, and the m ental form ations become weaker. When we talk about watching the m ind we are personalizing an event that is truly of cosm ic significance: through you, 66"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"consciousness is awakening out of i ts dr eam of identification with form and withdrawing from form . This foreshadows, but is already part of, an event that is probably still in the distant future as far as chronological tim e is concerned. The event is called - the end of the world. When consciousness frees itself from its identification with physical and m ental forms, it beco mes what we may call pure or enlightened consciousness, or presence. This has already happened in a few indivi duals, and it seem s destined to happen soon on a m uch larger scale, although there is no absolute guarantee that it will happen. Most humans are still in the grip of the eg oic m ode of conscious ness: identified with their m ind and run by their m ind. If they do not free themselves from their m ind in time, they will be destroyed by it. They will experience increasin g confusion, conflict, violence, illness, despair, m adne ss. Egoic m ind has beco me like a sinking ship. If you don' t get off, you will go down w ith it. The collective egoic m ind is the most dangerously insane and destructive entity ever to in habit this planet. What do you think will happen on this planet if human consciousness remains unchanged? Already for m ost humans, the only respite they find from their own m inds is to occasional ly revert to a level of consci ousness below thought. Everyone does that every night during sl eep. But this also happe ns to some extent through sex, alcohol, and other drugs that suppress excessive m ind activity. If it weren't for alcohol, tranquiliz ers, antidepressants, as well as th e illegal drugs, which are all consum ed in vast quantities, the insanity of the hum an m ind would b ecome even m ore glaringly obvi ous than it is already. I be lieve that, if depri ved of t heir drugs, a large part of t he population would becom e a danger to them selv es and others. These drugs, of course, sim ply keep you stuck in dysfunction. Their widespread use only delays the breakdown of the old m ind st ructures and t he emergence of higher consciousness. While indi vidual use rs may get some relief from th e daily torture inflicted on them by their m inds, they are prevented from gene rating enough conscious presence to rise above thought and so find true liberation. Falling back to a level of consciousness be low m ind, which is the pre-thinki ng level of our distant ancest ors and of ani mals an d pl ants, is not an opt ion for us. There is no way back. If the human race is to survive, it will have to go on to the next stage. Consciousness is evolving througho ut the universe in billions of form s. So even if we didn' t m ake it, this wouldn' t matter on a cosm ic scale. No gain in consciousness is ever lost, so it would sim ply ex press itself through some other form . But the very fact that I am speaking here and you are listening or reading this is a cl ear sign that the new consciousness is gaining a foothold on the planet. 67"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"There is n othing personal in this: I am not teaching you. You are consciousness, and you are listening to yourself. T here is an Ea stern saying: \"The teacher and the taught together creat e the teaching.\" In any case, the words in them selves are n ot im portant. They are not t he Truth; they only poi nt to it. I speak from pres ence, and as I speak, you m ay be able to join me in that state. Although every word that I use has a history, of course, and comes from the past, as all language does, the words that I speak to you now are carriers of the high-energy fre quency of presence, quite apart from the meaning they convey as words. Silence is an even more potent carrier of pr esence, so when you read this or listen to me speak, be aware of the s ilence between and underneath the words. Be aware of the gaps. To listen to the silence, wherever you are, is an easy and direct way of beco ming present. Even if th ere is noise, there is always some silence underneath and in between the sounds. Listening to the s ilence immediately creat es stillness inside you. Only the stillne ss in you can perceive the silence outside. And what is stillness other than presence, consciousness freed from thought form s? Here is the living realization of what we have been talking about. Christ: The Reality Of Your Divine Presence Don' t get attached to any one word. You can s ubstitute \"Christ\" for presence, if that is more meaningful t o you. Christ is your G od essence or the Self, as it is som etimes called in the East. The only di fference betw een Christ and presence i s that Christ refers to your indwelling divi nity regardle ss of whether you are conscious of it or not, whereas presence means your awaken ed divinit y or God-essence. Many m isunderstandings and fals e beliefs about C hrist will clear if you realize that there is no past or future in Christ. To say that Christ was or will be is a contradiction in term s. Jesus was. He was a man who lived two thous and years ago and realized divine presence, his true nature . And so he said: \"Before Abraham was, I am .\" He did not say: \"I already existed before Abraham was born.\" That would have meant that he was still within. the dimension of tim e and form identity. The words I am used in a sentence t hat starts in the past tense indi cate a r adical shift, a discontinuity in the temporal dimen sion. It is a Zen-like statem ent of great profundity. Jesus attem pted t o convey directly, not through discursi ve t hought, the m eaning of pre sence, of self realization. He had gone beyond the consciousness dimens ion governed by tim e, into the realm of the timeless. Th e dim ension of eternity ha d co me into this world. Eternity, of course, does not mean endle ss time, but no t ime. Thus, the m an Jesus became Christ, a ve hicle for pure consciousne ss. A nd what is God' s self-definition in the Bible? Did God say \"I have always b een, and I always will be?\" Of course not. 68"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"That would have given reality to past and future. God said: \"I AM THAT I AM.\" No time her e, just presence. The \"seco nd coming\" of Christ is a tran sform ation of hum an consciousness, a shift from time to presence, fro m thinking to pure consciousness, not th e arrival of some man or woman. If \"Christ\" were to return tom orrow in som e externalized form , what could he or she possibly say t o you ot her th an this: \"I am the Truth. I am divine presence. I am et ernal life. I am within you. I am her e. I am No w.\" Never personalize Christ. Don' t make Christ into a form identity. Avatars, divine mothers, enlightened masters, the very few that are real, are not special as persons. Without a false self to uphold, defend, and feed, they are more sim ple, more ordi nary than the ordinary man or woman. Anyone w ith a strong ego woul d regard the m as insignificant or, m ore likely, n ot see them at all. If you are drawn to an enlightened teacher, it is because there is already enough presence in you to recognize presence in another. There were many people who did not recognize Jesus or the Buddha, as ther e are and always have been many people who are drawn to false teachers. Egos are drawn to bigger egos. Darkness cannot rec- ognize light. Only l ight can recognize light. So don' t believe that the li ght i s outside you or tha t it can only com e through one pa rticular form . If only your master is an incarnation of God, then who are you? Any ki nd of exclusi vity is i dentification with form , and identification with form m eans ego, no matter how well disguised. Use the master' s presence to reflect your ow n identi ty beyond nam e and form back to you and to becom e m ore intensely present yo urself. You will soon r ealize that there is no \"m ine\" or \"yours\" in presence. Presence is one. Group work can also be helpful for inte nsifying the light of your presence. A group of people com ing together in a state of pres ence gen erates a co llective en ergy field of great intensity. It not only raise s the degr ee of presence of each m ember of the group but also helps to free the collective hum an co nsciousness from its current state ofm ind dom inance. This will make th e state of presence increasi ngly more accessible to indivi duals. However, unless at least one m ember of the group i s already firm ly established in it and thus can hold the energy frequency of that state, t he egoic mind can easily reassert itself and sabotage the group' s endeavors. Although group work is invaluable, it is not enough, and you must not come to depend on it.

TH E INNER BO DY Being Is Your Deepest Self You spoke earlier about the importance of having deep roots with in or inhabiting the body. Can you explain what you meant by that? The body can beco me a point of acces s into the real m of Being. Let 's go into that more deeply now. I am still not quite sure if I fu lly understand what you mean by Being . \"Water? What do you m ean by that? I don' t understand it.\" This is what a fish w ould say if it had a hum an m ind. Please stop trying to understand Being. You have already had significant glim pses of Being, but the m ind will always try to squeez e it into a little box an d then put a label on it. It cannot be done. It cannot become an object of knowledge. In Being, subject and object m erge into one. Being can be felt as t he ever-present I am that is beyond name and form. To feel and thus t o know that you are and to abide in that deeply ro oted state is enlightenment , is the truth that Jesus says will make you free. Free from what? Free from the illusion that you are nothing m ore than your physical body and your mind. This \"illusion of the self,\" as the B uddha calls it, is the core error. Free from fear in its countless disguises as the inev itabl e consequence of that illusion - the fear that is your constant torm entor as long as you derive your sense of self only from this ephem eral and vulnerable form. And free from sin, which is the suffering you unconsciously inflict on yourself and others as long as this illusory sense of self governs what you thi nk, say, and do. Loo k Bey ond The Words I don't like the word s in. It implies that I am being judged and f ound guilt y. I can understand that . Over the centuries, many erroneous vi ews and interpretations have accum ulated around words such as sin, due to i gnorance, m isunderstanding, or a desire to control, but they contain an esse ntial core of truth. If you are unable to look 70"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"beyond such interpretations a nd so cannot recognize the r eality to which the word point s, then don' t use it. Don' t get stuck on the level of words. A word is no more than a means to an end. Ifs an abstraction. Not unlike a signpost, it points beyond itself. The word honey isn' t honey. You can study and ta lk about honey for as long as you like, but you won' t real ly know it until you taste it. After you have tasted it, the word becomes less im portant to you. You won' t be attached to it anym ore. Sim ilarly, you can talk or think about God continuously for the rest of your li fe, but does that mean you know or have even glim psed the rea lity to which the word points? It really is no m ore than an obsessive attach ment to a signpost, a mental idol. The reverse also applies: If, for wh atever reason, you disli ked the word honey, that might prevent you from ever tasting it. If you had a strong av ersion to the word God, which is a negative form of attachment, you m ay be denying not just the word but also the reality to which it points. Y ou would be cutting yourself off from the possibility of experiencing that reality. All this is, of co urse, intrinsically connected with being identified with your m ind. So, if a word doesn't work for you anymore, then drop it and replace it with one that does work. If you don' t like the word sin, then call it unconsciousness or insanity. That may get you closer to the truth, the reality behind the word, than a long-m isused word like sin, and leaves little room for guilt. I don't like those words either. They imply t hat there is something wrong with me. I am being judged. O f course there is something wrong w ith you - and you are not being judged. I don' t mean to offe nd you personally, but do you not belong to the human race that has killed over 100 m illion mem bers of thei r own species in the twentieth century alone?

Finding Your Invisible And Indestructible Reality You said that identification with our physica l form is part of the illusion, so how can the body, the physical form, bring you to a realization of Being? The body that you can see and touch cannot take you int o Being. But that visible and tangible body i s onl y an outer shell, or ra ther a lim ited and distorted perception of a deeper reality. In your natural state of c onnectedness with Being, this deeper reality can be f elt every mo ment as th e invisible inner body, the animating presence within you. So t o \"inhabit the body' is to feel the body from within, to f eel the life insi de the body and t hereby come to know that you are beyond the outer form . But that is only the beginning of an inwa rd journey that will take you ever m ore deeply into a realm of great stillness and peace, yet al so of great power and vibrant life. At first, you may only get fleeting g lim pses of it, but through them you wil l begin to realize that you are not just a me aningless fragm ent in an alien unive rse, briefly suspended between bi rth and death, allowed a few short-li ved pleasures followed by pain a nd ul tim ate annihilati on. Underneath your outer form , you are connected with something so vast, so i mmeasurable and sa cred, that it cannot be conceived or spoken of - yet I am speaking of it now. I am speaking of i t not t o gi ve you som ething to bel ieve in but to show you how you can know it for yourself. You are cut off from Being as long as your m ind takes up all your at tention. When this happens - and i t happens continuously for m ost peop le - you are not in your body. The m ind absorbs all your consciousness and t ransform s it int o m ind stuff. You cannot stop thinking. Com pulsive thinki ng has becom e a collec tive disease. Your whole sense of who you are is then derived from mind activity. Your identity, as it is no l onger rooted in Being, becom es a vul nerable and ever-needy mental construct, which creates fear as the predom inant underl ying em otion. The one thing that t ruly matters is then m issing from your life: awaren ess of your de eper self - your invisi ble and indestructible reality. To become conscious of Being, you need to reclaim consciousness from the mind. This is one of the m ost essential tasks on your spiritual journe y. It will free vast am ounts of consciousness that previously ha d been trapped in useless and com pulsive thinking. A very effective way of doi ng t his is sim ply to take the focus of your atte n- tion away from thinking and di rect it into the body, where Being can be felt in the first i nstance as the invisi ble energy fiel d th at give s life to what you pe rceive as the physical body. 72"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Connecting With The Inner Body Please try it now.

Transformation Through The Body Why have most religions condemned or de nied the body? It seems that spiritual seekers have always regarded the body as a hindrance or even as sinful. Why have so few seekers become finders? On the level of the body, humans are very close to anim als. All the basic bodily functions - pleasure, pain, br eathing, eating, drinki ng, defe cati ng, sleeping, the drive to fi nd a mate and procreate, and of course bi rth and death - we share with the ani mals. A long time after t heir fall from a state of grace and oneness into illusion, hum ans suddenly woke up i n what seemed to be an anim al body - and t hey found t his very disturbing. \"Don' t fool yourself. You ar e no more than an animal.\" This seemed to be the truth that was staring them in th e face. But it was too disturbing a truth to tolerate. Adam an d Eve saw that th ey were naked, and th ey became afraid. Unconscious denial of their animal nature set in v ery quickly. The threat that th ey 73"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"might be taken over by powerful insti nctual drives and revert back to com plete unconsciousness was indeed a very real one. Shame and taboos appeared around certain parts of the body and bodily functi ons, espe cially sexuality. The light of their consciousness was not yet strong enough to make friends with their animal nature, to allow it to be and ev en enjoy that aspect of thems elves - let alone to go deeply into it to find the divine hidden within it, the r eality within the illusion. So they did wha t they had to do. They began to disa ssociate from their body. They now saw them selves as having a body, rather than just being it. When religions arose, this disassociation became even m ore pr onounced as the \"you are not your body' belief. Countless people in East and West throughout the ages have tried to fi nd God, salvation, or enlighte nment through denial of the body. This took the form of denial of sense pleasures and of sexuali ty in parti cular, fasting, and ot her ascetic practices. They even inflicted pain on the body in an attem pt to weaken or punish it because they regarded it as sinful. In Christianity, this used to be called mortification of the flesh. Others trie d to escape from the body by entering trance states or seeking outof-the-body experiences . Many still do. Even the Buddha is said to have practiced body denial through fasting and extreme form s of asceticism for si x years, but he did not attain enlightenm ent until after he had given up this practice. The fact is that no one has ever becom e enlightened through denying or fighti ng t he body or through an out-of-t he- body experience. Although such an experience can be fascinating and can give you a glim pse of the state of liberation from the materi al form , in the end you will alwa ys have to return to the body, w here the essential work of transformation takes place. Transformation is through the body, not away from it. This is why no true master has ever advocat ed fight ing or leaving the body, although their m ind-based foll owers often have. Of the ancient teachings concerning the body, only certain fragments survive, such as Jesus' statement that \"your whole body will be filled with light,\" or they survive as myths, such as the belief that Jesus ne ver relinqui shed his body but remained one with it and ascended into \"heaven\" with it. Alm ost no one to t his day has understood those fragments or the hidden meaning of certain m yths, and the \"you are not your body' beli ef has prevailed uni versally, l eadi ng to body deni al and attem pts to escape from the body. Countless seekers have thus been prevented from attaining spirit ual realization for them selves and becom ing finders. Is it possible to recover the lost teachi ngs on the significance of the body or to reconstruct them from the existing fragments? 74"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"There is no need for that. All spiritual t eachings originate from the sam e Source. In that sense, there is and always has b een only one m aster, w ho m anifests in many different form s. I am that master, and so are you, once you are able to access the Source within. And the way to it is th rough the i nner body. Although all spirit ual teachings originate from the same Source, once they beco me verbalized and written down they are obviously no m ore than collec tions of words - and a word is not hing but a signpost, as w e talked about earlier. All such teachings are signposts pointing the way b ack to the S ource. I have already spoken of the Truth that is hidden within your body, but I will summarize for you again the lost teachings of the mast ers - so here is another signpost. Please endeavor to feel your inner body as you read or listen. Sermon O n The Bo dy What you perceive as a dense physical st ructure called the body, which is subject to disease, old age, and death, is not ultim atel y real - is not you. It is a m isperception of your essential reality that is beyond birth and death, and is due to the lim itations of your m ind, which, having lost touch with Being, creates the body as evidence of its illusory belief in separa tion and to justify its state of f ear. But do not turn away from the body, for within that sym bol of im permanence, li mitati on, and death that you perceive as the illusory creation of your m ind is conceal ed the splendor of your essential and imm ortal reality. Do not turn your attention elsewhere in your search for the Truth, for it is nowhere else to be found but withi n your body. Do not fi ght against the body, for in do ing so you are fighting against your own reality. You are your body. The body that you can see and touch is only a thin illusory ve il. Underneath it lies the invisibl e inner body, the doorway into Being, into Life Unmanifested. Through t he inner body, you are inseparably connected to this unm anifested One Life - birthless, deathl ess, eternally present. Through the inner body, you are foreve r one with God. Have Deep Roots Within The key is to be in a state of permanen t connectedness with your inner body - to feel it at all times. This will rapidly deep en and transform your life. The more consciousness you direct into the inner body, the higher its vi brational frequency becom es, m uch like a light that grows bri ght er as you turn up the dimmer switch and so increase the flow of electricity. At this higher energy level, ne gativity cannot affect you anym ore, and you tend to attract new ci rcum stances that reflect this higher frequency. 75"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"If you keep your att ention i n the body as m uch as possible, you will be anchored i n the Now. You won' t lose yourself in the exte rnal world, and you won' t lose yourself in your m ind. Thoughts and e motions, fears and desires, m ay still be there to some extent, but they won't take you over. Please exam ine where your attention is at this m oment . You are listening to me, or you are reading these words in a book. That is the focus of your attenti on. You are also peripherally aware of your surroundi ngs, other people, and so on. Furtherm ore, there may be some m ind act ivity around what you are hearing or reading, some mental co mment ary. Yet there is no need for an y of this to absorb all your attention. See if you can be in touch with your inner body at the same time. Keep some of your attention within. Don' t let it all flow out. Feel your whol e body from within, as a single field of energy. It is almost as if you were listening or r eading with your whole body. Let this be your practice in the days and weeks to com e. Do not gi ve all your attention away to the mind and the external world. By all m eans focus on what you are doing, but feel t he inner body at the sam e time whenever possi ble. Stay root ed within. Then obs erve how this c hanges your state of consciousness and the quality of what you are doing. Whenever you are waiting, wher ever it may be, use that time to feel the inner body. In this way, traffic jam s and line-ups be come very enjoyable. Instead of mentally projecting yourself away from the Now, go m ore deeply in to the Now by going more deeply into the body. The art of inner-body awaren ess will develop into a co mpletely new way of living, a state of permanent connectedness with Being, and will add a depth to your life that you have never known before. It is easy to stay present as the observe r of your m ind when you are deeply rooted within your body. No matter what happe ns on the outside, nothing can shake you anym ore. Unless you stay present - and inhabiting your b ody is always an essential aspect of it - you will continue t o be ru n by your m ind. The script in your head that you learned a long tim e ago, the condit ioni ng of your m ind, will di ctate your thinki ng and your behavior. You m ay be free of it for brief intervals, but rarely for long. This is especially true when something \"goes wrong\" or t here is some loss or upset. Your conditioned reaction will then be involuntary, automatic, and predictable, fueled by the one basic em otion that underlies the m ind identified state of consciousness: fear. So when such challenges come , as they always do, make it a habit to go within at once and focus as much as you can on the i nner energy field of your body. This need 76"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"not take long, just a few seconds. But you need to do it the m oment that the challenge presents itself. Any delay will allow a conditioned mental -emotional reaction to arise and take you over. When you focus within and feel the inner body, you immediately becom e still and present as you are with drawing consciousness from the m ind. If a response is required in that situ ation, it will come up from this deeper level. Just as the sun is infinitely brighter than a candle flame, there is infinitely m ore intelligence in Being t han in your m ind. As long as you are in conscious contact with your inner body, you are like a tree that is deeply rooted in the earth , or a building with a deep and solid foundati on. The latter analogy is used by Jesus in the generally misunderstood parable of the two men w ho buil d a house. One man builds it on t he sand, without a foundation, and when the st orm s and floods com e, the house is swept away. The other man digs deep until he reaches the r ock, then builds his house, which is not swept away b y the floods. Before Yo u Enter The Body, Forgive I felt very uncomfortable when I tried to put my attention on the inner body. There was a feeling of agit ation and some nausea. So I haven't been able to experience what you are talking about . What you felt was a lingering em otion that you were probably unaware of, until yo u started put ting som e attention i nto t he body. Unless you fi rst give it some attention, the em otion will prevent you from gaining access to the inner body, which ties at a deeper level underneath it. Attentio n does not m ean that you st art thinking about it. It means to just observe the emotion, to feel it full y, and so t o acknowledge and accept it as it is. Som e em otions are easily identifie d: anger, fear, grief, and so on. Others may be much harder to label. They m ay just be vague fee lings of unease, heaviness, or const riction, halfway between an emotio n and a physical sensation. In any case, what matters is not whether you can attach a mental label to it but whether you can bring the feeling of it into awaren ess as much as possibl e. Attention is the ke y to transform ation - and full attention also implie s acceptance. At tention is like a beam of light - the focused power of your consciousne ss that transm utes everything into itsel f. In a fully functi onal organism, an emotion ha s a very short life span. It is like a mo mentar y ripple or wave on the surface of your Being. W hen you are not in your body, how ever, an em otion can survi ve inside you for days or weeks, or join wi th other em otions of a sim ilar frequency that have merged and beco me the pain-body, a parasite that can live inside you for year s, feed on your energy, lead to physical illness, and make your life miserable (see Chapter a). 77"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"So place your attention on feeling the em otion, and check whether your m ind is holdi ng on to a gri evance pattern such as blame, self-pity, or resentment that is feeding the em otion. If that is the case , it m eans that you haven' t forgiven. Non- forgiveness is often toward another person or yourself, but it m ay just as well be toward any situation or conditi on - past, pres ent or future - that your m ind refuses to accept. Yes, there can be non-fo rgiveness even with regard to the future. This is the mind 's refusal to accept uncertainty, to accep t that the future is ultim ately beyond its control. Forgiveness is to reli nquish your grievance and so to le t go of grief. It happens naturally once you realize that your grievance serves no purpose except to strengthen a false sense of self . Forgiveness is to offer no resistance to life - to allow life to live through you. The alternatives are pain and su ffering, a greatly restricted flow of life energy, and in many cases physical disease. The m oment you t ruly forgiv e, you have reclaim ed your power from the m ind. Non- forgi veness is the ve ry nature of the m ind, just as the m ind-made false self, the ego, cannot survive without strife and confl ict. The m ind cannot forgive. Only you c an. You become present, you enter your body, yo u fe el the vibrant peace and stillness that emanate from Being. That is why Je sus said: \"Before you enter the temple, forgive.\" Your Link With The Unmanifested What is the relationship between presence and the inner body? Presence is pure consciousness - consci ous ness t hat has been reclaimed from the mind, from the world of form. The inner body is your link with the Unm anifested, and in its deepest as pect is the Unmanifested: the S ource from which consciousness emanates as light emanates from the sun. Awareness of the inner body i s con- sciousness remem bering its origin and returning t o the Source. Is the Unmanifested the same as Being? Yes. The word Unmanifested attem pts, by way of negation, to express That wh ich cannot be spoken, thought or i magined. It poi nts t o what it is by saying what it is not. Being, on the other hand, is a positive term. Pleas e don' t get a ttached to either of these words or start believing in them. They are no m ore than signposts. You sai d that presence is consciousness that has been reclaimed from the mind. Who does the reclaiming? 78"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"You do. But since in your essence you are consciousness, we m ight as well say that it is an awakening of consciousness from the dream of form . This does not m ean tha t your own form will instantly vanish in an explosion of light. You can continue in your present form yet be aware of the form less and deathless deep within you. I must admit that this is way beyond my co mprehension, and yet on some deeper level I seem to know what you are tal king about . It's more like a feeling than anything else. Am I deceiving myself? No, you are not. Feeling will get you closer to the truth of who you are than thinking. I cannot tell you anything t hat deep within you don' t already know. When you have reach ed a certain stage of inner connected ness, you recognize t he truth when you hear it. If you haven' t reached that stage yet, the practice of body awareness will bring about the deepening that is necessary. Slow ing Dow n The Aging Process In the meantim e, awareness of the inner body ha s ot her benefits in the physical realm. One of them is a significant slowing down of the aging of the physical body. Whereas the outer body norm ally appears to grow old and wither fairly quickly, the inner body does not change with tim e, ex cept that you m ay feel it m ore deeply and becom e it m ore fully. If you ar e twenty years old now, the energy field of your inner body will feel just the same when you are eighty. It will be just as vibrantly alive. As soon as your habitual stat e changes from being out-of-th e-body and trapped in your mind to being in-the-body and present in the Now, your physical body will feel lighter, clearer, more alive. As there is more consciousne ss in the body, its m olecu lar structure actually beco mes l ess dense. M ore consciousness means a lessening of t he illusion of materiality. When you becom e identified m ore with th e tim eless inner body th an with the outer body, when presence becomes your normal mode of conscious ness and past and future no longer dom inate yo ur attention, you do not ac cum ulate time anym ore in your psyc he and in the cells of t he body. T he accumulation of time as the psychol ogical burden of past and future greatly im pairs the cells' cap acity for self renewal. So if you inhabit the inner body, the outer body will grow old at a m uch slower rate, and even when it does, your timeless essence will shine through the outer form , and you will not give the a ppearance of an old person. Is there any scientific eviden ce for this? 79"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Try it out and you will be the evidence. Strengthening The Immune System Another benefit of this practice in the phys ical realm is a great strengthening of the imm une system which occurs when you inhabit the body. T he m ore consciousness you bring into t he body, the st ronger t he imm une system becomes. It is as if every cell awakens and rej oices. The body love s your a ttention. It is also a potent form of self healing. Most il lnesses creep in wh en you are not present in t he body. If the master is not present in the house, all ki nds of shady characters will take up residence there. When you inhabit your body, it will be hard for unwanted guests to enter. It is not only your physical imm une syst em that becom es strengthened; your psyc hic imm une system is greatly enhanced as well. The latter protect s you from the negative mental-emotional force fields of others, which are highl y contagious. Inhabiting t he body protects you not by putti ng up a shield, but by raising t he fre quency vibra tion of your t otal energy field, so that anything that vibrat es at a lowe r frequency, such as fear, anger, depression, and so on, now exists i n what is virtually a different order of reality. It doesn' t enter your fie ld of consciousness anym ore, or if it does you don't need to offer any resistance to it because it passes right through you. Please don't just accept or reject what I am saying. Put it to the test. There is a simple but powerful self-healing meditation that you can do whenever you feel the need to boost your im mune system . It is particularly effective if used when you feel the first sym ptom s of an illness, but it also works with illnesses that are already entrenched if you use it at frequent in tervals and with an intense focus. It will also count eract any disruption of your en ergy field by some form of negativity. However, it is not a substit ute for the mo ment-to-m oment practice of being in t he body, otherwise, its effect will only be tem porary. Here it is. When you are unoccupied for a few m inutes, a nd especially last thing at night before falling asl eep and first thi ng i n the m orni ng before getting up, \"f lood\" your body wi th consciousness. Close your eyes. Lie flat on your back. Choose different parts of your body t o focus your attention on briefl y at first: hands, feet, arm s, legs, abdomen, chest, head, and so on. Feel the life energy insi de those pa rts as intensely as you can. Stay with each part for fifteen seconds or so. Then let your attention run through t he body like a wave a few times, from feet to h ead and back again. Th is need only take a minute or so. After that, feel the inner body in its totality, as a single field of energy. Hold that feeling for a few minutes. Be intensely present during that ti me, present in every cell of your body. Don't be con cer ned if the m ind occasionally succeed s in 80"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"drawing your attenti on out of the body a nd you l ose yourse lf in som e thought. As soon as you notice that this has happened, just return your attent ion to the inner body. Let The Breath Ta ke You Into The Body At times, when my mind has been very ac tive, it has acquired such momentum that I f nd it impossible to take my attenti on away from it and feel the inner body. This happens particularly when I ge t into a worry or anxiety pa ttern. Do you have any suggestions? If at any time you are finding i t hard to get in touch with the inner body, it is usual ly easier to focus on your breathing first. Conscious breathing, which is a powerful meditation in its own right, will gradually put you in touch wit h the body. Follow t he breath with your attention as it m oves in a nd out of your body. Breathe into the body, and feel your abdomen expandi ng and contracting slight ly with each inhalation and exhalation. If you find it easy t o vi sualize, close your eyes and see yourself surrounde d by light or immersed in a lum inous substance - a sea of consciousness. Then breathe in that light. Feel that luminous substance filling up your body and malting it lum inous also. Then gradually focu s m ore on the feeling. You are now in your body. Don' t get attached to any visual im age. Creative Use Of M ind If you need to use your m ind for a specific purpose, use it in conjunction with your inner body. Only if you are able to be conscious without thought can you use your mind creatively, and the easiest way to enter that state is through your body. Whenever an answer, a solution, or a crea tive idea is needed, stop thinking for a moment by focusi ng attention on your inne r energy field. Beco me aware of th e stillness. When you resume th inking, it will be fresh a nd creative. In any thought activity, make it a habit to go back and forth every few m inutes or so between thinking and an inner kind of listening, an inner stillness. We c ould say: don' t just think with your head, think with your whol e body. The Art Of Listeni ng When listening to another person, don' t just listen with your m ind, listen with your whole body. Feel the energy field of your inner body as you l isten. That takes attention away from thinking and creates a still space that en ables you to truly listen without the m ind interfering. Y ou are giving the other person space - space to be. It is the m ost precious gift you can give.

At the deepest level of Being, you are one with all that is. Most human relationships consist mainly of minds interacting with each other, not of hum an beings communicating, being in co mm union. No relationship can thrive i n that way, and that is why there is so m uch conflict i n relationships. When the m ind is runni ng your life, conflict, strife and pr oblem s are inevitable.

PO RTALS INTO TH E UNMANIFESTED Going Deeply Into The Body I can feel the energy inside my body, especi ally in my arms and legs, but I don't seem to be able to go more deeply, as you suggested earlier. Make it into a meditation. It needn' t take long. Ten to fifteen m inutes of clock time shoul d be sufficient. Make sure first that there are no external di stractions such as telephones or people who are l ikely to interrupt you. Sit on a chair, but don' t lean back. Keep the spine erect. Doing so will help you to stay alert. Alternatively, choose your own favorite pos ition for meditation. Make sure the body is rela xed. Close your eyes. Take a few deep breaths. Feel yourself breathing i nto t he lower abdomen, as it were. Observe how it expands and contracts slightly with each in and out breat h. Then beco me awar e of the entire inner energy field of the body. Don' t think about it– feel it. By doing this, you reclaim con- sciousness from the m ind. If you find it help ful, use the \"light\" visualization I described earlier. When you can feel the inne r body clearly as a single field of energy, let go, if possi ble, of any vi sual im age and focus ex clusively on the feeling. If you can, also drop any mental image you may still ha ve of the physical body. All that is left then is an all-encom passing sense of presence or \"bei ngness,\" and the inner body is felt t o be without a boundary. Then take your attention even m ore deeply into that feeling. Becom e one with it. Merge with the energy field, so that there is no longe r a perceived duality of the observer and th e observed, of you and your body. The distincti on between inner and outer also dissol ves now, so there is no inner body anym ore. By going deeply into th e body, you have transcended the body. Stay in thi s realm of pure Being for as l ong as feels com fortable; then become aware again of the physical body, your breathi ng and physical senses, and open your eyes. Look at your surroundings for a few minutes in a m editative way - that is, without labeling them mentally -- a nd continue to feel the inne r body as you do so. Having access to t hat form less realm is truly lib erating. It frees you from bondage to form and identification with form . It is life in its undifferentiated state prior to its fragmentation into m ultiplicity. We may ca ll it the Un manifested, the invisible Source of all things, the Being within all be ings. It is a realm of deep stillness and 83"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"peace, but also of joy and intense aliven ess. Whenever you are present, you become `transparent' to some extent to the light , the pure consciousness that emanat es from this Source. You also realize that the light is not separate from who you are but constitutes your very essence. The Source Of Chi Is the Unmanifested what in the East is called chi, a kind of universal life en ergy? No, it isn' t. The Unmanifested is the source of chi. Chi is t he inner e nergy field of your body. It is the bri dge be tween the outer you and t he Sour ce. It lies halfway between the manifested, the world of form, and the Unmanifested. Chi can be likened to a river or an energy stream . If you take the focus of your consciousness deeply into the inner body, you are tracing the course of this river back to its Source. Chi is movement ; the Un manifested is stillness. When you reach a point of absolute stillness, which is nevertheless vibrant with life, you have gone beyond the inner body and beyond chi to the Source itself the Unm anifested. Chi is the link between the Unmanifested and the physical universe. So if you take your attention deeply into the inner body, you may reach this poi nt, this singularity, where the world diss olves i nto the Unmanifested and t he Unm anifested takes on form as the energy stream of chi, which then beco mes the world. This is the point of birth and deat h. When your consciousness is directed outward, m ind and world arise. When it is di rected inward, it realizes i ts own Source and returns home into the Unmanifested. Th en, when your consci ousness comes back to the m anifested world, you reassume the form identity that you tem porarily relinquished. You have a name, a past, a life situation, a fut ure. But in one essential respect, you are not the same person you were before: You will have glim psed a reality within yourself that is not \"of this world,\" although it isn' t separate from it, just as it isn' t separate from you. Now let your spiritual practice be this: As you go about your life, don' t give 100 percent of your attent ion to t he external wo rld and t o your m ind. Keep some within. I have spoken about this already. Feel the inner body even when engaged in everyday activities, especially when engaged in relationships or when you are relating with nature. Feel the stillness deep in side it. Keep the portal open. It is quite possible to be conscious of the Unmanifested throughout your l ife. You feel it as a deep sense of peace somewhere in th e background, a sti llness that ne ver leaves you, no matter wha t happens out here. You becom e a bridge between the Unmanifested and the manifested, between God and the world. This is the state of connectedness with the Source that we call enlightenment. 84"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Don' t get the im pression that the Unmanifest ed is separate from the manifested. How could it be? It is the life within every form , the inner essence of all that exists. It pervades this world. Let me ex plain. Dreamles s Sleep You take a journey into the Unmanifested every night when you enter the phase of deep dreaml ess sleep. You merge with the Source. You draw from it the vital energy that sustains you for a while when you return to the manifested, the world of separate form s. This energy is m uch m ore vital than food: \" Man does not l ive by bread alone.\" But in dream less sleep, you don' t go into it consciously. Although the bodily functions are still operating, \"you” n o lo ng er ex ist in th at st ate. C an you imagine wh at it wo uld be lik e to go into dream less sleep with ful l consc iousne ss? It is impossible to imagine it, because that st ate has no content. The Unmanifested does not l iberate you unt il you enter it consciousl y. That' s why Jesus did not say the truth will make you fr ee, but rather: \"You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.\" This is not a conceptual truth. It is the truth of eternal life beyond form , which is know n directly or not at all. But don' t attem pt to stay conscious in dream less sleep. It is highly unlikely that you will succeed. At most, you m ay remain conscious duri ng the dream phase, but not beyond t hat. This is called lucid dream ing, which may be interesting a nd fascinating, but it is not liberating. So use your inner body as a portal thro ugh which you enter the Unmanifested, and keep that portal ope n so that you stay connect ed with the Source at all times. It makes no difference, as far as the inner body i s concerned, whether your outer physical body is ol d or young, frail or strong. The inner body i s timeless. If you are not yet able t o feel the inner body, use one of the other por tals, alt hough ul timately they are all one. Som e I have spoken about at length already, but I' ll mention them again briefly here. Other Portals The Now can be seen as the main portal. It is an essential aspect of every other port al, including t he inner body. You cannot be in your body without being intensely present in the Now. Time and the manifested are as inextricably linked as are the timeless Now and the Unm anifested. When you di ssolve psychol ogi cal tim e through intense present- moment awareness, you become conscious of the Unmanifested both directly and indirectly. Directly, you feel it as the radi ance and power of your consci ous presence - no content, just presence. Indirectly, you are aware of the Unm anifested in and through t he sensory realm. In other word s, you feel the God-essence in every 85"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"creature, every flower, every stone, and you rea lize: `All that is, is holy.\" This is why Jesus, speaking entirely from his essence or Christ identit y, says in t he Gospel of Thomas: \"Split a piece of wood; I am th ere. Lift up a stone, and you will find me there.\" Another portal int o the Unmanifested is creat ed through the ces sation of thinking. This can start with a very sim ple thing, such as taking one conscious breath or looki ng, i n a state of intense alertness, at a flower, so that there is no m ental commentary running at the s ame ti me. Ther e are many ways to creat e a gap in the incessant stream of thought. T his i s what meditation is all a bout. Thought is part of the real m of the manifested . Continuous m ind activity keeps you im prisoned in the world of form and becom es an opaque sc reen that prevents you from becom ing conscious of the Unmanifested, conscious of the form less and tim eless God-essence in yourself and in all things and a ll creatures. When you are intensely present, you don' t need to be concerned about the cessa tion of thinking, of course, because the mind then stops aut omatically. That' s why I said the Now is an essent ial aspect of every other portal. Surrender - the letting go of mental-em otional resistance to what is - also beco mes a portal into the Un manifested. The reason for this is sim ple: in ner resistance cuts you off from other peopl e, from yourself, from the world around you. It strengthens t he feeling of separateness on whi ch the ego de pends for its survival. The stronger the feeling of separateness, the m ore you are bound to the manifested, to the world of separate form s. The m ore you are bound to the world of form, the harder and more im penetrable your form identity becomes. The portal is closed, and you are cut off from the inner dim ension, the dimension of de pth. In the state of surrender, your form identity softens and becomes somewhat \"transparent,\" as it were, so the Unm anifested can shine through you. Ifs up to you t o open a porta l in your life that gives you conscious access to t he Un manifested. Get in touch with the ener gy field of the i nner body, be intensely present, disidentify from the mind, surrender to what is; these are all portals you can use - but you onl y need to use one. Surely love must also be one of those portals? No, it isn' t. As soon as one of the portal s is open, love is present in you as the \"feeling-realization\" of oneness. L ove isn' t a portal; it' s what co mes through the portal into this world. As long as you are completely trapped in your form identity, there can be no love. Your task is not to search for love but to find a portal through which love can enter. 86"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Silence Are there any other portals apart from those you just mentioned?

Pay more attention t o the silence than to t he sounds. Paying attention t o outer silence creates inner silence: the m ind beco mes still. A portal is opening up. Every sound is born out of sil ence, dies back into silence, and during it s life span is surrounde d by silence. Silence enables the sound tobe. It is an intri nsic but unm anifested part of every sound, every musical note, every song, every word. The Un manifested is present in this world as s ilence.

Even during a conversatio n, becom e conscious of t he gaps between words, t he brief silent intervals between sentences. As you do that, the dim ension of stillness grows wit hin you. You cannot pay att ention t o silence without si multaneously beco ming still within. Silence without, stillness within. You have entered the Un manifested. Space just as no sound can exist w ithout silence, nothi ng c an exis t without no-t hing, without the em pty space that enables it to be. Every physical object or body has co me out of nothing, is surrounded by nothi ng, and will eventually re turn to nothing. Not only that, but even inside every physical body there is far m ore \"nothing\" than \"something.\" Physicists tell us that the solidity of matter is an illusion. Even seem ingly soli d m atter, including your physi cal body, is ne arly 100 percent empty space - so vast are the distances between th e atoms co mpared to their size. Wh at is more, even inside every atom there is mostly empty space. Wh at is left is more like a vibrational frequency than pa rticles of solid m atter, more like a m usical n ote. Buddhists have known that fo r over 2,500 years. \"Form is em ptiness, em ptiness is form,\" stat es the Heart Sutra, one of t he best known ancient Buddhi st texts. The essence of all things is em ptiness. The Un manifested is not only present in th is world as silence; it also pervades the entire physical universe as space - from within and without. This is just as easy to 87"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"miss as silence. Everybody pays attention to the things in space, but who pays attention to space its elf? You seem to be implying that \"emptiness\" or \"nothi ng\" is not just not hing, that there is some mysterious quality to it. What is this nothing? You cannot ask such a question. Your m ind is trying to make nothing int o som ething. The m oment you m ake it into something, you have m issed it. Noth ing - space - is the appearance of the Unmanifested as an ex ternalized phenomenon in a sense-perceived world. That' s about as m uch as one can say about it, and even that is a kind of paradox. It cannot becom e an object of knowledge. You can' t do a Ph.D. on \"nothing.\" When scientists st udy space, th ey usually make it i nto something and thereby miss its essence entirely. Not surprisingly, the latest theory is that space is n't em pty at all, that it is filled with som e substance. Once you have a theory, it' s not too hard to find evidence to substantiate it, at least until some othe r theory comes along. \"Nothing\" can only become a por tal into the Unman ifested fo r you if you don' t try to grasp or understand it. Isn't that what we are doing here? Not at all. I am giving you pointers to show you how you can bring the dimension of the Unm anifested into your lif e. We are not trying to unde rstand it. There is nothing to underst and. Space h as no \"existence.\" \"To exist\" lite rally means \"to stand out.\" You cann ot understand space because it doesn't stand out. A lthough in itself it has no existence, it enables everything else to exist. Sile nce has no existence either, nor does the Un manifested. So what happens if you withdraw attent ion from the objects in space and become aware of space itself ? What is the essence of this room? The furniture, pictures, and so on are in the room, but they are not the room . The floor, walls, and ceiling define the boundary of the room , but they are not th e room either. So what is the essen ce of the room ? Space, of course, empty space. Th ere would be no \"room' without it. Since space is \" nothing,\" we can say that what is not there is m ore im portant than what is there. So becom e aware of th e space that is all around you. Don' t think about it. Feel it, as it were. Pay attention to \"nothi ng.\" As you do that, a shift i n consciousness ta kes pl ace inside you. Here is why. The inner equi valent to objects in space such as furniture, walls, and so on a re your m ind objects: thoughts, em otions, and the obj ects of the senses.

In other words: You cannot think and be aware of space - or of silence, for that matter. By beco ming aware of the em pty space around you, you si multaneously become aware of the space of no-m ind, of pure consciousness: the Unm anifested. This is how the contem plation of space can beco me a portal for you. Space and silence ar e two aspect s of the same thing, the same nothing. They are an externalization of inner space and inner silence, which is stillness: the infinitely creative womb of al l existe nce. Most humans are com pletely unconscious of t his dimension. There is no inner space, no stillne ss. They are out of balance. In other words, they know the world, or think they do, but they don' t know God. They identify exclusively with t heir own physical and ps ychological form , unconscious of essence. And becau se every form is highly unstable, th ey live in fear. This fear causes a deep misperception of t hem selves and of ot her hum ans, a distortion in their vision of t he world. If som e cosm ic convulsi on brought about the end of our world, the Unm anifested would remain totally unaffected by thi s. A Course in Miracles expresses this truth poignantly: \"Nothing real can be threaten ed. Nothing unreal exists. Herein lies th e peace of God.\" If you remain in conscious connection with the Unm anifested, you value, love, and deeply respect the manifested and every life form in it as an expression of the On e Life beyond form . You also know that every fo rm is destined to dissolve again and that ultimately nothing out here matters all that m uch. You have \"o verco me the world,\" in the words of Jesus, or, as th e Buddha put it, you have \"crossed over to the other shore.\" The Tru e Nature Of Space An d Time Now consider this: If there were nothing but silence, it wouldn' t exist for you; you wouldn' t know what it is. Only when sound appears does sil ence come into being. Sim ilarly, if there were only space without any objects in space, it wouldn't exist for you. Imagine yourself as a point of consci ousness floating in the vastness of space - no stars, no galaxies, just em ptiness. Sudde nly, space wouldn' t be vast anym ore; it would not be there at all. There would be no speed, no m ovement from here to there. At least two points of reference are need ed for distance and space to co me into being.

The thousa nds of stars you can see with the naked eye are no more than an infi nitesimal fraction of what is there. Over 100 billion galaxies can already be detected with the m ost powerful telescopes, each galaxy an \"island universe\" with billions of sta rs. Yet what is even m ore awe- inspiring is the infinity of space itself, the depth and stillness that allows all of that magnificence to be. Nothing could be m ore awe-inspiring and majestic than the inconceivable vastness and stil lness of space , and yet what is it? Emptiness, vast em ptiness. What appears to us as space in our un iverse perceived through the mind and the senses is the Unmanifested itself, extern alized. It is the \"body\" of God. And the greatest miracle is this: That stillness and vastness that enables the universe to be, is not just out there in space - it is also wi thin you. When you ar e utterly and totally pres ent , you encounter it as the still inner space of no-m ind. Within you, it is vast in depth, not in extension. Spati al extension is ultimately a mispercep tion of infinite depth - an attribute of the one transcenden tal reality. According to Einstein, space and time are not separate. I don't really understand it, but I think he is saying that time is the fo urth dimen sion of space. He calls it the \"space-time continuum.\" Yes. What you perceive externally as space and ti me are ulti mately illusory, but they contain a core of truth. They are the t wo essential attributes of God, infinity and eternity, perceived as if they had an exte rnal existence outside you.

Conscious Death Apart from dreaml ess sleep, which I men tioned already, there is one ot her invol untary portal. It opens up briefly at the tim e of physi cal death. Even if you have missed all the other opportuni ties for spiritu al realization duri ng your lifetime, one last portal will open up for you i mmediately after the body has died. There are countless accounts by people who ha d a visual impression of this port al as radiant light and then returned from wh at is commonly known as a near-death experience. Many of them also spoke of a se nse of blissful se renity and deep peace. In the Tibetan Book of the Dead, it is described as \"the lu minous splendor of the col - orless li ght of Em ptiness,\" whic h it says i s \"your own true self.\" This portal opens up only very briefly, and unless you have al ready encountered the dimension of the Unm anifested in your li fetime, you will likely m iss it. Most people carry t oo m uch residual resistance, t oo much fear, too much attachment to sensory experience, too much identification with the manifested worl d. So they see the po rtal, turn away in fear, and then lose consciousness. Most of what happens after that is involuntary and automatic. Eventually, there will be another round of birth and death. Their presence wasn' t strong enough yet for conscious imm ortality. So goi ng t hrough thi s portal does not mean anni hilat ion?

I know that it will happen. In other words, you are waiting for an event in time to save you. Is this not the core error that we have been talking about? Salva tion is not elsewhere in place or time. It is here and now. What does that state ment mean, \"salvati on is here and now\"? I don't understand it . I don't even know what salvation means. Most people pursue physical pl easures or va rious form s of psychological gratification because they believe that those things will m ake them happy or free them from a feeling of fear or lack. Happiness may be perceived as a heightened sense of aliveness attained through physical pleas ure, or a more s ecu re and more co mplet e sense of self attained throug h some form of psychological gratification. This i s the search for salvation from a stat e of unsatis factoriness or insufficiency. In variably, any satisfaction that they obtain is short -liv ed, so the condit ion of sa tisfaction or fulfillment is usually projected once agai n ont o an imaginary poi nt a way from the here and now. \"When I obtain this or am f ree of that - then I will be okay.\" This is the unconscious m ind-set that creates the illusion of salvation in the future. True salvation is fulfillment, peace, life in a ll its fullness. It is to be who you are, to feel within you t he good t hat has no oppos ite, the joy of Being that depends on nothi ng outside itself. It is felt not as a pa ssing experience but as an abiding presence. In theistic language, it is to \"know God\" - not as something outside you but as your own innerm ost essence. True salvation i s to know yourself as an inseparable part of the tim eless and formless One Life from wh ich all that exists derives its being. 93"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"True salvation is a st ate of freedom - fro m fear, from suffering, from a perceived state of lack and insufficiency and therefore from all wanting, needing, grasping, and clinging.

Something needs to happen, or you need to become this or t hat before you can be free and fulfi lled. It is sa ying, in fact, that you need ti me - that you need to fi nd, sort out, do, achieve, acqui re, become, or understand something before you can be free or com plete.

So there is no only way to salvation: Any condition can be used, but no particular c ondition is needed. Howe ver, there is only one point of access: the Now.

Love/Hate Relationships Unless and until you access the consci ousness frequency of presence, al l relationships, and particularly intimate relationships, are de eply flawed an d ultim ately dysfunctional.

Both are in fact different as pects of the same dysfunction. I a m speaking here of what is co mm only called rom antic relationships - not of true love, which has no opposite because it arises from beyond the m ind. Love as a continuous state is as yet very rare - as rare as conscious human beings. Brief and elusive glim pses of love, however, are possible whenever there is a gap in the stream of m ind. The negative side of a relationship is, of course, m ore easily recognizable as dysfunctional than t he positi ve one.

There is a physical as well as a psychological dimension to this state. On the physical level, you are obviously not whole, nor will you ever be: You are either a man or a woman, which is to say, one-hal f of the whole.

This is why it is the most deeply satisfyi ng experience the physic al realm can offer. But sexual union is no more than a fleeting glim pse of wholeness, an instant of bliss. As long as it is unconsciously sought as a means of salva tion, you are seeking the end of duality on the level of form , where it cannot be found.

Relationships As Spiritual Practice As the egoic m ode of consc iousness a nd all the social, political, and econom ic structures that it created enter the final st age of collapse, the relationships betw een men and wo men ref lect the deep state of cris is in which hum anity now finds itself.

Millions are now living alone or as single parents, unable to establish an intimate relationshi p or unwil ling to repeat the insane drama of past relationshi ps. Others go from one relationshi p to anot her, from one pleasure-and-pa in cycle to another, in search of the elusive goal of fulfillm ent through union wi th the opposite energy polarity. Still others com prom ise and conti nue to be together in a dysfunctional relationshi p in which negativi ty prevails, fo r the sake of the ch ildren or security, through force of habit, fear of being alone, or some ot her m utually \"beneficial\" arrangem ent, or even through the uncons cious addiction to the e xcitem ent of em otional drama and pain. However, every crisis represents not onl y danger but also opportuni ty. If relationshi ps energize and magnify egoic mind patterns and act ivate the p ain-body, as they do at this tim e, why not accept this fact rath er than try to escape from it? Why not cooperate with it i nstead of avoiding rela tionships or c ontinuing to pursue the phantom of an ideal partner as an answer to your problem s or a means of feeling ful- filled? The opportunity that is conceal ed w ithin every crisis does not manifest until all the facts of any given situation are ac knowledged and fully accepted. As long as you deny them , as long as you try t o escape from them or wish that thi ngs were different, t he window of opportuni ty does not open up, and you rem ain trapped inside that situation, which will remain the same or deteriorate further. With the acknowledgment and acceptance of the facts also com es a degree of freedom from them. For exam ple, when you know there is disharm ony and you hold that \"knowing,\" through your know ing a new factor has come in, and the disharmony cannot remain unchanged. When you know you are not at peace, your knowing cre- ates a still space th at surrounds your nonp eace in a loving and tender em brace and then transm utes your nonpeace into peace. As far as inner transform ation is concerned, there is nothing you can do ab out it. You cannot transform yourself, and you certainly cannot transform your part ner or anybody else. All you can do is creat e a space for transform ation to happen, for grace and love to enter. So whenever your relationshi p is not w orkin g, whenever it brings out the \"m adness\" in you and in your partner, be glad. What was unconscious i s being brought up t o the light. It i s an opportunit y for salvation. Every m oment, hold the knowing of t hat moment, particularly of your in ner state. If there is anger, know that there is anger.

The relationship then becom es your sadhana, your spi ritual practice. If you observe unc onscious behavior in your partner, hold it in the loving em brace of your knowing so that you won't react . Unconsciousness and knowing cannot coexist fo r long - even if the knowing is only in the other person and not in the one who is acting out t he unconsciousness. The energy form that lies behind ho stility and attack finds the pr esence of love absolutely intolerable. If you re act at all to your partner' s unconsciousness, you become uncon- scious yourself. But if you then rem ember to know your reaction, nothing is lost. Hum anity is under great pressure to evolve because it is our only chance of survi val as a race. This will affect every aspect of your life and close relationshi ps in particular. Never before have relationshi ps been as problem atic and conflict ridde n as they are now. As you m ay have noticed, th ey are not here to m ake you happy or fulfilled. If you continue to pursue the goal of salv ation through a relationship, you will be disillusioned again and ag ain. But if you accept that the relationship is here to make you conscious instead of happy, the n the relat ionship wi ll offer you salvation, and you will be aligning yourse lf with the higher consciousness that wants to be born into thi s world. For those who hold on to the old patterns, there will be increasing pain, violence, conf usion, and madness. I suppose that it tak es two to make a rela tionshi p into a spiritual practice, as you suggest. F or example, my partner is still acting out his old patterns of jealousy and control. I have point ed this out many times, but he is unable t o see it. How many people does it take to make your life into a spiritual practice? Never mind if your partner will not cooperate. Sanity - consciousness - c an only come into this world through you. You do not need to wait for t he world t o become sane, or for somebody else to becom e conscious, befo re you can be enlightened. You m ay wait forever. Do not accuse each other of bei ng unconscious. The mo men t you start to argue, you have identified with a mental positi on a nd are now defending not onl y that positi on but also your sense of self. Th e ego is in charge. You have become unconscious. At times, it may be appropriat e to point out certain as pects of your partner' s behavior. If you are very alert, very present, you can do so without ego invol vement - without blam ing, accusing, or m aking the other wrong. When your partner behaves unconsciously, relinquish all judgment. Judgm ent is either to confuse someone' s unconscious beha vior with who they are or to proj ect your own unconsciousness ont o a nother person and m istake that for who they are. To relinquish judgment does not m ean th at you do not recognize dysfunction a nd unconsciousness when you see it.

You will then e ither be t otally free of reaction or you m ay react and still be the knowing, the space i n which the reaction is watched and allowed to be. Instead of fighting th e darkness, you bring in the li ght. Instead of reacting to delusion, you see the delusion yet at the same time look through it . Being the knowing creates a clear space of loving presence that allows all things and all people to be as they are. No greater cat alyst fo r transformation exists. If you practice this, your part ner cannot stay with you and remain unconscious. If you both agree that the relationship will be your spiritual practice, so m uch the better. Yo u can then express your thoughts a nd feelings to each other as soon as the y occur, or as soon as a reaction com es up , so that you do not create a time gap in which an unexpressed or unac knowledged em otion or grieva nce can fester and grow. Learn to give expression to w hat you fe el without blam ing. Learn to l isten to your partner in an open, nondefensive way. Give your part ner space for expressing him self or herself. Be present. Accusing, defendi ng, attacking - all those patterns that are designed to strengthen or protect the eg o or to get its needs met will then become redundant. Giving space to others - and to your self - is vita l. L ove cannot flourish without i t. When you have rem oved the two factors t hat are destructive of relationshi ps: When the pain-body has been transm uted and you are no longer identified with m ind and mental posit ions, a nd if your partner has done t he same, you will experience the bliss of the flowering of relationship. Instead of m irroring to each other your pain and your unconsciousness, in stead of satisfyi ng your mutual addictive ego needs, you will reflect back to each othe r the love that you feel deep within, the love that comes with the realization of your onene ss with all that is. This is the love that has no opposi te. If your partner is still identified with the m ind and the pain-body while you are already free, this will represent a major challe nge - not to you but to your partner. It is not easy to live with an enlight ened person, or rather it is so e asy that the ego finds it extremely threatening. Re memb er that the ego need s problem s, conflict, and \"enem ies\" to strengt hen the sense of sepa rateness on which i ts identit y depends. The unenlightened partner' s m ind will be deep ly frustrated because its fixed positions are not resiste d, which means they will become shak y and weak, and there is even the \"danger\" that they may collapse altogether, resulting in loss of self. The pain-body is dem anding feedback and not getting it. The n eed for argument, drama, and conflict is not being met. But beware: Som e peopl e who are unresponsive, withdrawn, insensiti ve, or cut off from their feelings may think and try to convi nce others t hat they are enlightened, or at least that there is \"nothi ng wrong\" wit h them and everything wrong wi th their partner.

But if you can feel y our em otions, you are not far from the radiant inner body j ust underneath.

If there isn' t an emanation of l ove and jo y, com plete presence and openness toward all beings, then i t is not enli ght enm ent. A nother indicator is ho w a person behaves in difficult or challenging sit uations or whe n things \"go wrong.\" If yo ur \"enlightenm ent\" is egoic self-delusion, then life will soon gi ve you a challenge that will bring out your unconsciousness in whatever form - as fear, anger, defensiveness, judgm ent, depression, and so on. If you are in a rela tionship, many of your challenges will come through your partne r. For exam ple, a wo man may be challenge d by an unresponsive male partner who lives alm ost entirely in his head. Sh e will be challenged by his inability to hear her, to give her attention and space to be, which is due to his lack of presence. The absen ce of love in the relationship, which is usually m ore keenly felt by a wo man than a man, will trigger the wo man' s pain-body, and through it she will attack her partner - blame, criticize, ma ke wrong, and so on. This in turn now becom es his challenge. To defend him self against her pain-body' s attack, which he sees as totally unw arranted, he will beco me ev en m ore deeply entrenched in his mental positions as he justifies, defends him self or counterattacks. Eventually, this may activate his own pain-body. When both part ners have thus been taken over, a level of deep unconsciousness has been reache d, of em otional viol ence, savage attack and counterattack. It will not subside un til both painbodies have replenished them selves and then enter the d orm ant stage. Until the next time. This is only one of an endless num ber of possi ble scenarios. Many volumes have been written, and many m ore could be written, about the ways in which unconsciousness is brought out in m ale-female relationships. But, as I said earlier, once you understand the root of the dysfun ction, you do not need t o explore its countless manifestations. Let 's briefly look again at the scenario I ha ve just described. Every challenge that it contains i s actually a disguised opport unity for salvation. At every stage of the unfol ding dysfunctional proc ess, freedom from unconsciousness is possi ble. For exam ple, the wo man's hostility could become a signal for the man to come out of his mind-identified state, awak en into the No w, become pres ent - instead of beco ming even m ore identified with his m ind, even m ore unconscious. Instead of \"being\" the pain-body, the woman could be the knowing t hat watche s the em otional pain i n herself, thus accessing the power of the Now and initiating the transmutation of the pain. This would remove the com pulsive a nd automatic outward projection of it. She 103"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"could then express her feelings to her partner. There is no guarantee, of course, that he will listen, but it gives him a good chan ce to becom e present and certainly breaks the insane cycle of the involuntary acti ng out of old m ind patterns. If the woman misses that opport unity, the man could wa tch his own mental-em otional reaction to her pain, his own defensiveness, rather than being the reaction. He could then watch his own pain-body be ing tri ggered and thus bring consciousness into his em otions. In this way, a clear an d still spa ce of pur e awareness would co me into being - the knowing, t he silent witness, the watcher. This awareness does not deny the pain and yet is beyond it. It allows the pain to be and yet transm utes it at the same tim e. It accepts ev erything and transforms ev eryt hing. A door woul d ha ve opened up for her through which she could easily join him in that space. If you are consistentl y or at least predom inantly pre sent in your relationship, this will be the greatest challenge fo r your partner. They will not be able to tolerate your presence for very long and stay unconscious. If the y are ready, they will walk through the door t hat you opened for them and join you in that state. If they are not, you will separate like oil and water. The light is too painful for som eone who wants to remain in darkness. Why Women Are Closer To Enlightenment Are the obstacles to enlightenment the same for a man as for a woman? Yes, but the em phasis is di fferent. Generally speaking, it is easier for a woman to feel and be in her body, so she is naturall y closer t o Being and potenti ally closer t o enlightenment than a man. This is why many ancient cultures instinctively chose femal e figures or analogies to represent or describe the for mless and transcenden tal reality. It was often seen as a wo mb that gives birth to everything in creation and sustains and nourishes it during its life as form . In the Tao Te Ching, one of the most ancient and profound books ever written, the Tao, which could be translated as Being, is described as \"infinite, eternally present, the mother of the universe.\" Naturally, wom en are closer to it than men since th ey virt ually \"embody' the Unm anifested. What is more, all creatures an d all things must eventually return to the Source. `All things vanish into the Tao. It alone endures .\" Since the Source is seen as female, this is represented as the light and dark side s of the archetypal fem inine in psychol ogy and m ythology. The Goddess or Divine Mother has two aspects: She gi ves life, and she takes life. When the m ind took over and hum ans lost to uch with the reality of their divine essence, they started to think of God as a male figure. Society became male dom inated, and the female was m ade subordi nate to the male. 104"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"I am not suggesti ng a return to earlier fema le representations of the divine. Some people now use the term Goddess instead of Go d. They are redressing a balance between male and female that was lost a long tim e ago, and that is good. But it is still a represent ation and a concept, perhaps tem porarily useful, just as a map or a signpost is tem porarily useful, but m ore a hindrance than a help when you are ready to realize the reality beyond all concepts and im ages. Wh at does rem ain true, however, is that the energy frequency of t he m ind appears to be essentially male . The m ind resists, fight s for control, uses, m anipulates, attacks, tries to grasp and possess, and so on. This is why the traditional God is a patria rchal, controlli ng aut horit y fi gure, an often angry m an who you shoul d live in fear of, as the Old Testament suggests. This God i s a projection of the human m ind. To go beyond the m ind and reconnect with the deeper reality of Being, very different qualities are needed: surrender, nonjudgment, an openness that allows life to be instead of resisting it, the capacity to hol d all thi ngs in t he loving em brace of your knowing. All these qualities are m uch m ore cl osely related to the female principle. Whereas m ind-energy is hard and rigid, Be ing-energy is soft and yielding and yet infinitely m ore powerful than m ind. The m ind runs our civili zation, whereas Being is in charge of all life on our pla net and beyond. Being is the very Intell igence whose visible m anifestation is t he physical universe. Although wom en are potentially close r to it, men can also acce ss it within them selves. At this time, the vast m ajority of m en as well as women are still in the grip of the mind: identified with the thinker and the pain -body. This, of course, is what prevents enlightenment and the flowering of l ove. As a general rule, the major obstacle for men tends to be the thinki ng mind, and the major obstacl e for women the pain-body, although i n certain indivi dual cases the oppos ite may be true, and in others the two factors m ay be equal. Dissolving The Collectiv e Female Pain -Body Why is the pain-body more of an obstacle for women? The pain-body usually has a collective as well as a personal aspect. The personal aspect is the accu mulated residue of emo tional pai n suffered in one' s own past. The collective one is the pain accu mu lated in th e collective human psyche over thousands of years through disease, torture, wa r, murder, cruelty, madness, and so on. Everyone's personal pain-body also partakes of t his collective pain-body. There are different strands in the collecti ve pain-body. For exam ple, cer tain races or countries in which extreme form s of strife and viol ence occu r have a heavier coll ective pai n- body t han others. Anyone with a strong pa in-body and not enough consci ousness t o 105"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"disidentify from it will not only continuously or periodically be forced to relive their em otional pain but may also easily become either the perpetrator or the victim of violence, depending on whether their pain-b ody is predom inantly active or passive. On the other hand, they m ay also be pot entially closer to enlightenment. This potential i sn't necessarily realized, of cour se, but if you are trapped in a nightmare you will probably be m ore strongly m otivated to awaken than som eone who is j ust caught in the ups and downs of an ordinary dream . Apart from her personal pain- body, every wom an has her share in what could be described as the collective female p ain- body - unless she is full y conscious. This consists of accu mulated pain suffered by women partly th rough male subjugation of the fem ale, through slavery, exploitation, ra pe, childbirt h, chi ld loss, and so on, over thousands of years. The em otional or phy sical pain that for many women precedes and coincides with t he menstrual flow i s th e pain-body in its collective aspect that awakens from its dormancy at that tim e, a lthough it can be triggered at other tim es too. It restricts the free flow of life ener gy through the body, of which menstruation is a physical expression. Let' s dw ell on this for a m oment a nd see how it can becom e an opportunit y for enlightenment. Often a woman is \"taken over\" by the pain- body at that time. It has an extrem ely powerful energetic charge that can easil y pull you into unc onscious i dentification with it. You are then activ ely possessed by an energy fiel d that occupies your i nner space and pretends to be you - but, of course , is not you at all. It speaks through you, acts through you, thinks through you. It will cr eate negative situations in your life so that it can feed on the energy. It wants more pain, i n what ever form . I have described this process already. It can be v icious and de structive. It is pure pain, past pain - and it is not you. The num ber of women who are now approach ing the fully conscious state already exceeds that of men and will b e growing ev en faster in the y ears to come. Men may catch up with them in the e nd, but for some considerab le time there will be a gap between the consciousness of m en and that of women. Women are regaining t he function t hat is thei r birthri ght and, theref ore, co mes to them m ore naturally than it does to men: to be a bridge between th e manifested world and the Unmanifested, between physicality and spirit. Your main task as a woma n now is to transm ute the pain-body so that it no l onger com es between you a nd your t rue self, t he essence of who you are. Of course, you al so have to deal with the ot her obstacle to enlight- enm ent, which is t he thinki ng m ind, but the inte nse presence you generate when dealing with the pain-body will also fr ee you from identification with the m ind. 106"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"The first thing to remem ber is this: As l ong as you make an id entity for yourself out of the pain, you cannot become free of it. As long as part of your sense of self is invested in your e motional pain, you w ill unc onsciously resist or sabotage every attem pt that you m ake to heal that pain. Why? Quite sim ply because you want to keep yourself intact, and the pain has becom e an essential part of you. This is an unconscious process, and the only way to overcom e it is to m ake it conscious. To suddenly see that you ar e or have been attached to your pain can be quite a shocking realization. The m oment you rea lize this, you have broken the attachment. The pain-body is an energy field, alm ost like an entity, that ha s become tem porarily lodged in your inner space. It is life energy th at has beco me trapped, energy that is no longer flowing. Of course, th e pain-body is there becaus e of certain thi ngs t hat happened in the past. It is the living pa st in you, and if you identify with it, you identify with the past. A victim identity is the belief that the past is m ore powerful than the present, which is th e opposite of the truth. It is the belief that other people and what they did t o you are responsi ble for who you are now, for your em otional pain or your inability to be yo ur true self. The truth is th at the only power there is, is contained within t his m oment: It is the pow er of your presence. Once you know that, you also realize that you are responsible fo r your i nner space now - nobody else is - and that the past can not prevail against the power of the Now. So identifi cation prevents you from deali ng with the pain-bod y. Some wom en who are already conscious enough to have re linquished their victim identity on the personal level are still holding on to a coll ective victim identity \"what m en did to wom en.\" They are right - and they are also wrong. They are right inasm uch as the collective fem ale painbody is in large part due t o male violence inflicted on women and repression of the female principle thr oughout the planet over millennia. They are wrong if t hey derive a sense of self from this fact and thereby keep them selves im prisoned in a collective victim identity. If a woman is still holding on to anger, resentm ent, or condem nation, she is holdi ng on to her pain-body. This may give her a comforting sense of identity, of solidarity w ith other wo men, but it is keeping her in bondage t o the past and blocki ng full acce ss to her essence and true pow er. If women exclude themselves from men , that fosters a sense of separation and therefore a strengthening of t he ego. And the stronger the ego, the m ore distant you are from your true nature. So do not use the pain-body t o give you an identity. Use it for enlightenment instead. Transm ute it int o consciousness. One of the best tunes for t his is during menses. I believe th at, in the years to come, man y wo men will enter the fully conscious state during tha t tim e. Usually, it is a tim e of unconsci ousness for many women, as they 107"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"are taken over by the collectiv e female pain-body. Once you have reached a certain level of consciousness, however, you can reverse this, so instead of becom ing unconscious you become m ore conscious. I ha ve described the basic process already, but let m e take you t hrough it again, this tim e with special refere nce to the collective fem ale pain-body. When you know t hat the menstrual flow i s approaching, before you feel the first signs of what is comm only called prem enstrual tension, the awak ening of the collecti ve fem ale pain-body, become very alert a nd inhabit your body as fully as possibl e. When the first sign appears, you need to be alert enough to \"c atch\" it before it takes you over. For example, the first si gn m ay be a sudden strong irri tation or a flash of anger, or it may be a purely physical symp tom . Wh atever it is, catch it before it can take over your thinking or behavior. This simply means putting the spotlight of your attention on it. If it is an em otion, feel th e strong energy charge behind it. Know that it is the painbody. At the sam e time, be the knowing; that is to say, be aware of your conscious presence and feel its power. Any em otion that you take your presence into will quickly subside and become transmuted . If it is a purely physical sym ptom, the attention that you give it will prevent it fro m turning into an em otion or a thought. Then continue to be alert an d wait for th e next sign of the pain-body. When it appears, catch it ag ain in the same way as before. Later, when the pain-body has fully aw akened from its dorm ant state, you may experience considerable turbul ence in your inner space for a while, perhaps for several days. Whatever form this takes, stay present. Give it your com plete attention. Watch the turbulence inside you. Know it is there. Hold the knowing, and be the knowing. Remem ber: do not let the pain -body use your m ind and take over your thinking. Watch it. Feel its energy dire ctly, inside your body. As you know, full attention means full acceptance. Through sustained attention a nd thus accep tance, there comes transm utation. The pain-body becom es transform ed int o radi ant consciousness, j ust as a pi ece of wood, when placed in or near a fire, itself is transform ed into fire. Menstruation will then becom e not only a joyful and fulfilling expression of your wom anhood but also a sacred time of transm utati on, when you give birth to a new consciousness. Your true nature then shines forth, bot h in its fe male aspect as the Goddess and i n its transcendental aspect as the divine Being that you are beyond m ale and female duality. If your male partner is cons cious enough, he can help you with the practice I have just descri bed by hol ding t he frequency of inte nse presence particularly at this time. If he stays present whenever you fall back into unconscious identification with the 108"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"pain-body, which can and will happen at first, you will be able to quickly rejoin him in that state. This means th at whenever the pain-body tem porarily takes over, whether during m enses or at other times, your pa rtner will not m istake it for who you are. Even if the pain-body attacks him, as it probably will, he w ill not react to it as if it were \"you,\" withdraw, or put up som e ki nd of defense. He will hold the space of intense presence. Nothing else is needed for transform ation. At other times, you will be able to do t he same for hi m or help him reclaim consciousne ss from t he mi nd by drawing hi s attention into the here and now whenev er he become s identified with his thinking. In this way, a perm anent energy field of a pure and high fre quency will arise between you. No il lusion, no pain, no c onflict, nothing that is not you, and nothi ng that is not love can survive in it. This represents the fulfillment of t he divi ne, transpersonal purpose of your relationship. It becomes a vortex of consci ousness that will draw in many others. Give Up The Relat ionship With Yourself When one is fully conscious. would on e s till have a need f or a r elat ionship? Woul d a man st ill feel dr awn to a wom an? W ould a wom an still feel incom plete without a man? Enlightened or not, you are ei ther a m an or a woman, so on the level of your form identity you are not c omplete. You are one-hal f of the whole. This incom pleteness is felt as m ale-female attraction, the pull to ward the opposi te energy polarity, no m atter how conscious you a re. But in that state of inner connectedness, you feel this pull somewhere on the surface or periphery of your life. Anything that happens to you in that state f eels so mewhat like t hat. The w hole world seem s like waves or ripples on the surface of a vast and deep ocean. You ar e that ocean and. of course, you are also a ripple, but a ripple that has realized its tr ue identity as the ocean, and co mpared to that vastness and depth, the world of wave s and rippl es is not all that im portant. This does not m ean that you don' t relate deeply to other people or to your partner. In fact, you can relate deeply only if you are conscious of Being. Com ing from Being, you are able to focus beyond the veil of fo rm . In Being, male and female are one. Your form may continue to have certain needs, but Being has none. It is already com plete and whole. If those needs are met, that is b eautiful, but whether or not t hey are met makes no di fference to your deep inner stat e. So it is perfectly possible for an enlightened person, if the need for the male or female polarity is not met, to feel a sense of lack or incom pleteness on the outer level of hi s or her being, yet at the same time be totally co mplete, fulf illed, and at peace within. 109"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"In t he quest for enlightenment, is being gay a help or a hindrance, or does it not make any difference?

BEYOND HAPPINESS AND UNHAPPINESS THERE IS PEACE The Higher Good Beyond G ood And Bad Is there a difference betw een happiness and inner peace? Yes. Happiness depends on conditions being perceived as positive; inner peace does not. Is it not possible to attract only positive c onditions into our life ? If our attitude and our thinking are always positive, we w ould manifest only positive events and situat ions, wouldn't we? Do you truly know what is positive and wh at is negative? Do you have the total picture? There have been m any people for w hom lim itation, failure, loss, illness, or pain in whatever form turned out to be th eir greatest teacher. It taught them to let go of false self-images and supe rficial ego-di ctated goals and desires. It gave them depth, hum ility, and com passion. It made them m ore real. Whenever anything negative happens to you, there is a deep l esson concealed withi n it, although you may not see it at the time . Even a brief illness or an accident can show you what is real and unreal in your life, what ultimately matters and what doesn' t. Seen fro m a higher perspective, conditions are always positive. To be m ore precise: they are neither posi tive nor negative. They are as they are. And when you live in complete acceptan ce of what is - which is the onl y sane way to li ve - there is no \"good\" or \"bad\" in your li fe anym ore. There is only a higher good - which includes the \"bad.\" Seen from the perspective of the mind, however, ther e is good-bad, like- dislike, love-hate. Hence, in the Book of Genesis, it is sa id that Adam and Eve were no longer allowed to dwell in \"paradise\" wh en they \"ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\" This sounds to me li ke denial and self-dece ption. When something dre adful happens to me or someone close to me - accident, illness, pain of som e kind or death - I can pretend that it isn't bad, but the fact remains that it i s bad, so why deny it? 112"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"You are not pretending anythi ng.

If you forgive every mo ment - allow it to be as it is - then ther e will be no accu mul ation of resentment that needs to be forgiven at so me later tim e. Remem ber that we are not talking about ha ppiness here. For exam ple, when a loved one has just died, or you feel your own deat h approaching, you cannot be happy. It is im possible. But you can be at peace. There may be sadness and tears, but provi ded that you have relinquished resistance, unde rneath the sadness you will feel a deep serenity, a stillness, a sacred presence. This is the emanation of Being, this is inner peace, the good t hat has no opposite. What if it is a situati on that I can do something about? How can I allow it to be and change it at the same time? Do what you have to do. In the m eantim e, accept what is. Since m ind and resistance are synonym ous, acceptance immediately fr ees you from m ind dom inance and thus reconnects you with Being. As a result, the usual ego m otivations for \"doing\" - fear, greed, control, defending or feeding the fals e sense of self - will ceas e to operate.

The ultimate effect of all the evil and suffering in the world is th at it will force humans into realizing wh o they are beyond name and form.

The End Of Your Life Dra ma In that state of acceptance and inner pea ce, even though you may not c all it \"bad, \" can anything still come into yo ur life that woul d be called \"bad\" fr om a perspective of ordinary consciousness? Most of the so-called bad things t hat happen in people's lives are due to unconsciousness. They are sel f creat ed, or rather ego-created. I somet imes ref er to those thi ngs as \"drama.\" When you are fu lly conscious, drama does not come into your life anym ore. Let me rem ind you briefly how the ego operates and how it creat es drama. Ego is the unobserved m ind that runs your life when you are not present as the witnessing consciousness, th e watcher. The ego perceiv es itself as a s epar ate fragment in a hostil e universe, with no r eal inner connection to any other being, surrounde d by other egos which it either sees as a potential threat or which it will attem pt to use for its own ends. The basic ego patterns are desi gned to com bat its own deepseat ed fear and s ense of lack. They ar e resistance, cont rol, power, greed, defense, attack. Some of the ego's strategies are ex tremely clever, yet they never truly solve any of its problem s, sim ply beca use the ego itself is the problem. When egos come together, whether in pers onal relationshi ps or in organizations or institutions, \"bad\" things happ en sooner or later: drama of one kind or another, in t he form of conflict, problem s, power struggles, em otional or physical violence, and so on. This includes collective ev ils such as wa r, genocide, and expl oitation - all due to massed unconsciousness. Furthe rm ore, many types of illness are caused by the ego' s continuous resistance, which creates r estric tions and blockages in the flow of energy through t he body. When you reconnect w ith Being and are no longer run by your mind, you cease to create those things. Y ou do not create or participate in drama anym ore. Whenever two or mo re egos come together, drama of one kind or another ensues. But even if you live totally alone, you sti ll cr eate your own drama. When you feel sorry for yourself, that' s dram a. Wheny ou feel g uilty or anxious, that 's drama.

The ego runs their life. They have their whole sense of self invested in it. Even their - usually unsuccessful - search for an answer, a solution, or for hea ling becomes part of it. What they fear and resist most is the end of their drama. As long as they are their mind, what they fear and resist m ost is their own awakening. When you live in com plete acceptance of what is, that is the end of all drama in your life. Nobody can even have an argument with you, no m atter how hard he or she t ries. You cannot have an argument with a fully consci ous person. An argument implies identification with your m ind an d a mental position, as well as re sistance and reaction to the othe r person' s positi on. The result is that the polar opposites become m utually energized. These ar e the mechanics of unc onsciousness. You can sti ll m ake your point clearly and firmly, but there will be no reactive force behi nd it, no defense or attack. So it won' t turn int o dra ma. When you are fully consc ious, you cease to be in conflict. \"No one who is at one with himsel f can even conceiv e of conflict,\" stat es A Course in Miracles.

Imperma nence An d The Cy cles Of Li fe However, as long as you are in the physi cal dimension and li nked to the collective hum an psyche, physical pain - although rare - is still possible. This is not to be confused with suffering, with mental emo tional pain. All suffering is ego-created and is due to resistance. Also, as long as you ar e in this dimension, you are still subject to its cyclical nature and to the law of im perm anence of all things, but you no longer perceive this as \"bad\" - it just is. Through a llowing the \"isness\" of all things , a deeper dim ensi on underneath the play of opposit es reveals itself to you as an abiding presence, an unchanging deep stillness, an uncaused joy beyo nd good and bad. This is the joy of Being, the peace of God. On the level of form, there is birth and d eath, creation and dest ruction, growth and dissol ution, of seem ingly sepa rate form s. This is reflected everywhere: in the life cycle of a star or a planet, a physical body, a tree, a flower; in the rise and fall of nations, political system s, civilizations; and in the inevitable cycles of gain and loss in the life of an individual. 115"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"There are cycles of success, when things com e to you and thrive, and cycles of failure, when they wither or disintegrate a nd you have to let them go in order to m ake room for new things to ari se, or for t ransform ation to happen.

It is not true that the up cycle is good and the down cycle bad, except in the m ind' s judgm ent. Growth i s usually considered pos itive, but nothi ng can grow forever. If growth, of whatever kind, w ere to go on and on, it would event ually become monstrous and destructive. Dissolut ion i s needed for new growth to happen. One cannot exist without the other. The down cycle is absolutely essential for spiritual reali zation. You m ust have failed deeply on some lev el or experienced some deep loss or pain to be drawn to t he spirit ual dimension. Or perhaps your ve ry success became em pty and meaningless and so turned out to be failure. Failure lie s concealed in every success, and success in every failure. In thi s world, which is t o say on t he level of form , everybody \"fails\" sooner or later, of course, and every ach ievem ent eventually com es to naught. All form s are im perm anent. You can still be active and enjoy mani festing and creating new forms and circum stances, but you won' t be identifi ed w ith them . You do not need them to give you a sense of self. They are not your life - only your life situation. Your physical energy is also subject to c ycles. It cannot always be at a peak. There will be times of low as well as high en ergy. There will be periods when you are highly active and creative, b ut there may also be tim es when everythi ng seem s stagnant, when it seem s that you are not getting anywhere, not achieving anythi ng. A cycle can last for anything from a few hours to a few years. Ther e are larg e cycles and sm all cycles within these large ones. Many illnesses are created through fighting against the cycles of low energy, which ar e vital for regenerati on. The com pulsion t o do, and the tendency to derive your sense of self worth and identity from external factors such as achievement, is an inev itable illusion as long as you are identified with the mind. This makes it hard or impossible for you to accept the low cycles and allow them to be. Thus, the intelligence of the organism may tak e over as a self protective m easure and create an illness in order to force you to stop, so that the necess ary regenerati on can tak e place. The cyclical nature of the universe is closely linked with the i mper manence of all things and sit uations. The Buddha m ade th is a central part of hi s teaching. All conditions are highly unstable and in constant flux, or, as he put it, im permanence is a characteristic of every condition, every situ ation you will ever encounter in your life.

It m akes you ha ppy, makes you feel good about yourself, and it may become part of who you are or thi nk you are. But nothi ng lasts i n this dim en- sion where m oth and rust consume. Either it ends or it changes, or it may undergo a polarity shift: The same condition that was good yesterday or l ast year has suddenl y or gradually turned i nto bad. T he sam e condit ion t hat made you happy, then m akes you unhappy. The prosperity of today becomes the em pty consumerism of tom orrow. The happy wedding and honeym oon becom e the unhappy divorce or the unhappy coexistence. Or a conditi on disappears, so its absence m akes you unhappy. Whe n a condition or situation that the m ind has att ach ed itself to and identified with changes or disappears, the mind cannot accept it. It will cling to the di sappearing condition and resist the change. It is al mo st as if a lim b were b eing torn off your body.

I recent ly read about a fam ous act ress who died in her eighties. As her beau ty started to fade and became ravaged by old age, she grew desperately unhappy and became a recluse. She, too, had identifie d with a c ondi tion: her external appearance. First, the condition gave her a ha ppy sense of self, then an unhappy one. If she had been able to connect with the form less and tim eless lif e withi n, she could have watched and allowed the fading of her external form from a place of serenity and peace. Moreover, her external form would have become incr easingly transparent to the light shining through from her ageless true nature, so her beauty woul d not really have faded but sim ply becom e transform ed into spirit ual beauty. However, nobody t old her that t his is possi ble. The m ost essential kind of knowledge is not yet widely accessible.

The whole advertising industry and consumer society would collapse if people became enlightened and no longer sought to find their identity through things. The more you seek happiness in this way, the m ore it will elude you. Nothing out there will ever satisfy you except temporaril y and superfici ally, but you may need to experience many disillusionrnents before you realize that truth. Things and conditions can give you pleasure, but they will also give you pain. Things and conditions can give you pleasure, but they cannot give you j oy. Nothing can give you joy. Joy is uncaused and arises from within as the joy of Being. It is an essential part of the i nner state of peace, the state that has been called the peace of God. It is your natural state, not something that you need to work hard for or struggle to attain. Many people never realize that there can be no \"salvation' ' in anythi ng they do, possess, or attain. Those who do realize it often become world-weary and depressed: if nothing can give you true fulfillment, what is there left to strive for, what is the point in anything? The Old Testament prophet must have arrived at such a realizati on when he wrote \"I have seen everything that is done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind.\" When you reach this point, you are one step away from despair - and one step away from en lightenment. A Buddhist m onk once told me: 'All I have le arned in the twenty years that I have been a monk I can sum up in one sentence: A ll that arises passes away. This I know.\" What he meant, of course, was this: I have learned to offer no re sistance to what is; I have learned to allow the present moment to be and to accept the im perm anent nature of all things and conditions. Thus have I found peace. To offer no resistance to life is to be in a st ate of grace, eas e, a nd lightness. This state is then no longer dependent upon things being in a certain way, good or bad. It seem s alm ost paradoxical, yet when your inner dependency on form is gone, the general conditions of your life, the out er form s, tend to improve greatly. Things, people, or conditions that you thought yo u needed for your ha ppiness now com e to you with no struggle or effort on your part, and you are free to enjoy and appreciate them - while they last. All those things, of course, will still pass away, cycles will co me and go, but with dependency gone there is no fear of loss anym ore. Life flows with ease. The happiness that i s derived from some sec ondary source is never very deep.

In thi s context, the tw o words are alm ost synonym ous. Negativity ranges from irritation or im patience to fier ce anger, from a depr essed m ood or sullen resentm ent to suicidal despair. Som etimes the resistance triggers the emotional pain- body, i n which case even a m inor situation may produce intense negativity, such as anger, depression, or deep grief. The ego believes that through negativity it can manipulate reality and get what it wants. It believes that through it, it can a ttract a desirable condition or dissolve an undesirabl e one. A Course in Miracles right ly points out th at, whenever you are unhappy, t here is the unconscious belief th at the unhappiness \"buys\" you what you want. If \"you' - the m ind - did not belie ve that unhappiness works, why would you creat e it? The fact is , of cour se, that neg ativity does not work. Instead of attracting a desirable condit ion, i t stops i t from arisi ng. Instead of dissol ving an undesirable one, it keeps it in place. Its only \"useful\" function is that it strengthens the ego, and that is why the ego loves it . Once you have identified with some form of negativity, you do not want to let go, and on a deeply unconscious level, y ou do not want positive change. It would threaten your identity as a depressed, angr y, or hard-done-by pe rson. You will then ignore, de ny or sabotage the positive in your life. This is a c omm on phenomenon. It is also insane. Negativity is totally unnatural. It is a ps ychic pollutant, and there is a deep link between the poisoni ng and de struction of na ture and the vast negativity t hat has accu mulat ed in the collective human psyche . No other life form on the planet knows negativity, onl y humans, just a s no other life form violates and poisons t he Earth that sustains it. Have you ever seen an unhappy flower or a stressed oak tree? Have you com e across a depressed dolphi n, a frog that has a problem with self-esteem, a cat that cannot relax, or a bird that carries hatred and resentment? The only animals that may occasionally experience something akin to ne gativity or show signs of neurotic behavior are those that live in c lose contact with humans and so li nk i nto the human mind and its insanity. Watch any plant or animal and let it teach you accep tance of what is, surrender to the Now. Let it teach you Being. Let it teach you in tegrity - which means to be one, to be 119"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"yourself, to be real.

How peacefully they float along, at eas e with them selves, totally present in the Now, dignified and perfect as only a m indless creature can be. Occasiona lly, however, two duc ks will get into a fight - sometimes for no apparent reason, or be cause one duck has strayed into another' s private space. The fight usually lasts onl y for a few seconds, and then the ducks separate, swim off in opposite directions, and vigorous ly flap their wings a few times. Th ey then continue to swi m on peacef ully as if the fight had never happened. When I observed that for the first tim e, I suddenl y realized that by fl apping t heir wings they were rel easing surplus energy , thus pre venting it from becom ing trapped in their body and turning into negativity. This is natura l wisdom , and it is easy for them because they do not have a m ind th at keeps the past a live unnecessarily and then builds an identity around it. Couldn't a negative emotion al so contai n an important message? For example, if I often feel depressed, it may be a signal t hat there i s something wrong with my life, and it may force me to look at my life s ituation and make some changes. So I need to listen to what the emotion is tel ling me and not just dismiss it as negative. Yes, recurring negative em otions do som etimes co ntain a message, as do illnesses. But any changes that you make, whether th ey have to do with your work, your relationships, or your surroundings, are ultimat ely only cosmetic unless they arise out of a change in your l evel of consciousness. A nd as far as that is concerned, it can only mean one thing: becom ing m ore present. When you have reached a certain degree of presence, you don' t need negativ ity anym ore to tell you what is needed in your life situation. But as long as negativity is ther e, use it. Use it as a kind of signal that rem inds you to be more present. How do we stop negativity from arising, and how do we get rid of it once it is there? As I said, you stop it from arising by being fully present. But don' t become discouraged.

So, when confronted with someone else' s suffering or unconscious behavior, you stay present and in touch with Being and are thus abl e to look beyond the form and feel the other person' s radiant and pure Being through your own. At the le vel of Being, all suffe ring is recognized as an illusion. Suffering is due to identification with form. Miracles of healing sometimes occur through t his rea lization, by awakening Being-consciousness in others - if they are ready. Is that what compassion is? Yes. Compassion i s the awar eness of a deep bond betwee n yourself and all creatures. But there are two si des to co mpassion, two si des to this bond. On the one hand, since you are still here as a physical body, you shar e the vulnerability and mortality of your physical form with every ot her hum an and w ith every li ving being. Next tim e you say \"I have nothing in common w ith this person,\" remem ber th at you have a great deal in comm on: A few years from now - two years or seventy years, it doesn' t m ake m uch difference - both of you will have become rotting corpses, then piles of dust, then nothing at all. This is a s obering and hum bling realization that leaves little room for 123"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"pride. Is t his a negative thought? No, it is a fact. Why close your eyes to it? In t hat sense, there is total equality be tween you and every other creature. One of the m ost powerful spiritual practices is to m editate deeply on the m ortality of physical form s, including your own. This is called: Die before you di e. Go into it deeply. Your physical form is dissol ving, is no more. Then a mo ment comes wh en all mind-forms or thoughts also die. Yet you ar e still there - the divine presence that you are. Radiant, fully a wake. Nothing that wa s real ever died, only names, form s, and illusions. The realization of t his deathl ess dim ension, your true nature, is the other si de of com passion. On a deep feeling-leve l, you now recognize not onl y your own imm ortality but through your ow n that of every other creatur e as well. On the level of form , you share m ortality and the precariousne ss of existence. On the level of Being, you share eternal, radiant lif e. These are the two aspect s of com passion. In com- passion, t he seem ingly opposite feelings of sadness and j oy merge into one and beco me trans muted into a deep inner pe ace. This is the peace of God. It is one of the most noble feelings that humans are cap able of, and it has great healing and transformative power. But true co mpassion, as I have just de scribed it, is as yet rare. To have deep em pathy for t he sufferi ng of anot her being certainly requires a hi gh degree of consciousness but represents onl y one side of compassi on. It is not com plete. True compassion goes beyond em pathy or sym pathy. It doe s not happen until sadne ss merges with joy, the joy of Being beyond form , the joy of eternal life. Tow ard A Different Order Of Reality I don't agree that the body needs to die. I am convi nced that we can achieve phys ical immortalit y. We believe in de ath and that' s why the body dies. The body does not die because you believe in death. The body exists, or seem s to, because y ou believe in death. Body and deat h ar e part of the same illusion, creat ed by the egoic m ode of conscious ness, which has no awaren ess of the Source of life and sees itself as separat e and con stantly un der threat. So it creates the illusion that you are a body, a dense, physical vehicle that is constantly under t hreat. To perceive yourself as a vulnerable body th at was born and a little later dies - that's the illusion. Body and death: one illusion. You cannot have one without the other. You want to keep one side of the illusion and get rid of the other, but that is im possible. Either you keep all of it or you relinquish all of it. However, you cannot escape from the body, nor do you ha ve to. The body is an incredible misperception of your t rue na ture. But your true nature is concealed 124"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"somewhere within that illusion , not outside it, so the body is still the only point of access to i t. If you saw an angel but m istook it for a stone st atue, all you woul d have to do is adjust your vision and look m ore closely at the \"stone statue,\" not start looking somewhere else. You would then find th at there nev er was a stone statue. If belief i n death c reates the body, wh y does an animal have a body? An ani mal doesn't have an ego, and it doe sn't believe in death.... But it still dies, or seem s to. Remem ber that your percept ion of the wo rld i s a reflection of your state of consciousness. You are not sepa rate from it, and there is no objective wo rld out there. Every m oment, your consciousness creates th e world that you inhabi t. One of the greatest insights that has com e out of m odern physics is that of the unity between the observer and t he observed: the person c onducting the experim ent - the observing consciousness - cannot be se parated from the observed phenom ena, and a di fferent way of looking causes the observed phenome na to behave diffe rently. If you believe, on a deep level, in separation and the str uggle for survi val, then you see that belief reflected all around you and your perceptio ns are governed by fear. You inhabit a world of death and o f bodies fighting, killing, and devouring each other. Nothing is what it seem s to be. The worl d that you create and see through the egoic mind may seem a very im perfect place, ev en a vale of tears. But whatever you perceive is only a kind of sym bol, like an image in a dream . It is how your consciousness interprets and interacts w ith the m olecular en ergy dance of the universe. This energy is the raw m aterial of so-called phys ical reality. You see it in term s of bodies and birth and death, or as a struggl e for survi val. An infinite num ber of com pletely different interpretations, com pletely different worlds, is possi ble and, in fact, exists - all de pending on the per ceiving consciousness. Every being i s a focal point of consciousness, and every such focal point creates its own world, although all those worlds are interconnected. There i s a hum an world, an ant world, a dolphin world, and so on. There ar e countless beings whose cons ciousness frequency is so different from yours that you are probably unaw are of their existen ce, as they are of yours. Highly consci ous beings who are awar e of their connectedness with the Source and with each other would inhabit a world that to you would appear as a heavenly realm - an d yet all worlds are ultimately one. Our collective human world is largely creat ed through the level of consciousness we call mind. Even wit hin the co llective human world there ar e vast differences, many 125"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"different \" sub-worl ds,\" depending on the per ceivers or creators of their respective worlds. Since all worlds are interconnect ed, wh en collective human consciousnes s becom es transform ed, nature and the animal kingdom will reflect that transform ation. Hence the statement in the Bible that in the com ing age \"The lion shall li e down with the lam b.\" This points to the possibility of a co mpletely different order of reality. The world as it appears to us now is, as I said, largely a reflecti on of the egoic mind. Fear being an unavoidable consequence of e goic delusion, it is a world dom inated by fear. Just as the i mages in a dream are sym bols of inner states and feelings, so our collective real ity is largely a sym bolic expression of fear and of the heavy layers of negativity that have accu mulated in the co llective human psyche. We are not separate from our world, so when the majority of humans beco me free of egoic delusion, this inner change will affect all of creation. You will literally i nhabit a new world. It is a shift in planetary co nsciousness. The str ange Buddhist sayi ng that every tree and every blade of grass will even tually become enlightened points to the sam e truth. According to St. Paul, the whole of creation is waitin g for humans to beco me enlightened. That is how 1 inte rpret his sa ying that \"The created universe is waiting with eager expectation for God' s sons t o be revealed.\" St. Paul goe s on to say that all of creation will become redeemed through this: \"Up to the pres ent... the whole cre- ated universe in all its parts groans as if in the pangs of childbi rth.\" What is being born is a new consciousness and, as its inevitable reflection, a new world. This is also foretold in t he New Testament Book of R evelation: \"Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first h eaven and the first earth had passed away.\" But don' t confuse cause and effect. Your prim ary task is not to seek salvation through creating a better world, but to awaken out of identification with form. You are then no longer bound to this world, this level of reality. You can feel your roots in the Un manifested and so are free of attach ment to the manifested world. You can still enjoy the passing pl easures of this worl d, but there is no fear of loss anymore, so you don' t need to cling to them . Although you can enjoy sensory pl easures, the craving for sensory experience is gone, as is the constant search for fulfil lment through psychol ogical gratification, through feeding the ego. You are in touch wi th som ething infinitely greater than any pleasure, great er than an y manifested thing. In a way, you then don' t need the world anym ore. You don' t even need it to be different from the way it is. It is onl y at this poi nt that you begin to m ake a real contri bution toward bringing about a better world, toward creating a differe nt order of reality. It is only at this point that you are able to feel true com passion and t o help ot hers at the level of cause. Only those who have transcended the world can bring about a better world. 126"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"You m ay remem ber that we talked about the dual nature of t rue com passion, whic h is awareness of a common bond of shared morta lity and imm ortality. At this deep level, com passion becomes healing in the widest sens e. In that state, your healing influence is pri marily based not on doing but on be ing. Everybody you come in contact with will be touched by your presence and aff ected by the peace th at you em anate, whether they are conscious of i t or not. W hen you are fully present and people around you m anifest unconscious behavior , you won't feel the need to react to it, so you don't give it any reality. Your peace is so vast and deep that a nything that is not peace dis- appears into it as if it had never existed. This breaks the kar mic cy cle of action an d reaction. Animals, t rees, flowers will feel your peace and respond to it. You teach through be ing, through dem onstrating the peac e of God. You become the \"light of the world,\" an emanation of pure consciousne ss, and so you elim inate suffering on the level of cause. You elim inate unconsciousness from the world. This doesn't mean that you may not also teach through doing - for example, by point ing out how to disidenti fy from the mind, recognize unconscious pa tterns within oneself, and so on. But who you are i s al ways a m ore vital teaching and a m ore powerful t ransform er of the world than what you say, and m ore essential even than what you do. Furthe rm ore, to recognize the primacy of Being, and thus work on the level of cause, does not exclude the possibil ity that your compassion may sim ultaneously m anifest on the level of doing and of effect, by alleviating sufferi ng whenever you com e across it. When a hungry person asks you for bread and you have some, you will give it. But as you give the bread, even though your in teraction may only be ve ry brief, what really matters is this moment of shared Being, of which the bread is only a symbol. A deep healing t akes place within it. In that m oment, there is no giver, no receiver. But there shoul dn't be any hunger and starva tion in the first pl ace. How can we create a better world without t ackling evi ls such as hunger and violence first? All evils are the effect of unconsciousness. You can alleviate the effects of unconsciousness, but you cannot elim inate th em unless you eliminate their cause. True change happens within, not without. If you feel called upon to alleviate suffering in the world, that is a very noble thi ng to do, but remem ber not to focus exclusively on the outer; otherwise, you will encounte r frust ration and despair. Without a profo und change in hum an consciousness, t he world' s suffering is a bottom less pit. So don' t let your com passion become one-sided.

THE MEANING OF SURRENDER Acceptance Of The No w You menti oned \"surrender\" a few times. I d on't like that idea. It sounds somewhat fatalistic. If we always accept the way thi ngs are, we are not going to make any effort to improve them. It seems to me what progr ess is all about, bot h in our personal liv es and collectively, is not to accept the limitati ons of the present but to strive to go beyond them and create something better. If we hadn't done this, we would still be living in caves. How do you reconcile su rrender with changing things and get ting things done? To some people, surrender m ay have negative connotations , implying defeat, giving up, failing to rise to the challenges of lif e, beco ming leth argic, and so on. True surrender, however, is something entirely diffe rent. It does not mean to passively put up with whatever situation you find yourself in and to do not hing about it . Nor does it mean to cease making plans or initiating positive action. Surrender is the sim ple but profound wi sdom of yielding t o rather than opposing th e flow of life. The only place where you can expe rience the flow of life is the Now, so to surrender is to accept the present m ome nt uncondi tionally and without reservation. It is to reli nquish inner resistance to what is . Inner resistance is to say \"no\" to what is, through mental judgm ent and em otional negativity. It becomes particularly pronounced when things \"go wrong,\" which means that there is a gap between the dem ands or rigid expectations of your m ind a nd what is. That is the pain gap. If you have lived long enough, you will know that th ings \"go wrong\" quite often. It is pre- cisely at those tim es that surrender needs to be practiced if you want to elim inate pain and sorrow from your life. Acceptance of wh at is immediately frees you from m ind identification and thus reconnects you wit h Being. Resistance is the m ind. Surrender is a purely inner phe nom enon. It doe s not m ean that on the out er level you cannot take action and change th e situation. In fact, it is not t he overall situation t hat you need to accept when you surrender, but just the tiny segm ent called the Now. For example, if you were stuck in the mud som ewhere, you wouldn' t say: \"Okay, I resign m yself to bei ng stuck i n the m ud.\" Resignation is not surrender. You don' t need to accept an undesirabl e or unpleasant life situation. Nor do you need to deceive yourself and say tha t there is nothi ng w rong wit h being stuc k in the mud. No. You 129"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"recognize fully t hat you want to get out of it. You then narrow your attention down t o the present m oment without m entally labeling it in any way. This means that there is no judgm ent of the Now. Therefore, there is no re sistance, no em otional negativity. You accept the \"isne ss\" of this m oment. Th en you t ake action and do all that you can to get out of the m ud. Such action I call positi ve action. It is far m ore effective than negative action, which arises out of anger, despair, or frustra tion. Until you achieve the desired result, you continue to prac tice surrender by refrain ing from labeling the Now. Let me give you a visual analogy to illustrate the point I am malting. You are walking along a path at night , surrounded by a thick fog. But you have a powerful flashli ght that cuts through the fog and creates a narro w, clear space in f ront of you. The fog is your l ife situation, which in cludes past and future ; the flashlight is your conscious presence; t he clear sp ace is the Now. Non-surrender hardens your ps ychologic al form , the shell of t he ego, and so creates a strong sense of separateness. The world around you and people in particular com e to be perceived as thre atening. The unconsci ous compulsi on to dest roy others through judgm ent arises, as does the need to com pete and dom inate. Even nature becomes yourenemy and your perceptions and inte rpreta tions are governed by fear. The mental disease that we call paranoia is only a sli ghtly more acute form of this norm al but dysfunctional state of consciousness. Not only your psychological form but also yo ur physical form - your body - becomes hard and rigid t hrough resista nce. Tension arises i n different parts of t he body, a nd the body a s a whole contracts. The free flow of life energy through the body, which is essential for its healthy functioning, is gr eatly restricted. Bodywork and certain form s of physical therapy can be helpful i n re stori ng thi s flow, but unless you practice surrender i n your everyday life, those things can only give temporary sym ptom relief since the cause - the resistance pa ttern - has not been dissol ved. There is something within you that rem ains unaffected by the tr ansient circumstan ces that m ake up your life situa tion, and only through surrende r do you have access to it. It is your life, your very Being - which exis ts eternally in the ti meless realm of the present. Finding this life is \"the one thi ng t hat is needed\" that Jesus talked about. If you find your life situation unsatisfactor y or even intolerable, it is onl y by surrenderi ng first t hat you can break the unconscious resistance pattern that perpetuates that situation. Surrender is perfectly co mpatible with ta king action, initiating change or achiev ing goals. But in the surrendered state a totally different ener gy, a different quality, flows into your doing. Surrender reconnects you with the source-energy of Being, and if 130"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"your doing is infuse d with Being, it become s a joyful celebration of life energy that takes you m ore deeply into the Now. Th rough nonresistance, the quality of your consciousness and, therefore, the quality of whatever you are doing or creating is enhanced immeasurably. The re sults will then look after thems elves and reflect that quality. We could call this \"sur rendered action.\" It is not work as we have known it for thousands of years. As more humans awaken, the word work is going to disappe ar from our vocabulary, and perhaps a new word will be created to replace it. It is the quality of your consciousness at th is m oment that is the m ain d eterm inant of what kind of future you will experience, so to surrender is the m ost im portant thing you can do to bring about pos itive change. Any action you ta ke is secondary. No truly positi ve action can arise out of an unsurre ndered state of consciousness. I can see that if I am in a situation that is unpleasant or unsati sfactory and I completel y accept the moment as it is, th ere will b e no suffering or unhappiness. I will have risen above it. But I still can't quite see where the energy or motivation for taking act ion and bringi ng about change w ould come from if there isn't a certain amount of dissat isfac tion. In the state of surrender, you see very clear ly what needs to be done, and you take action, doi ng one t hing at a time and focu sing on one thing at a tim e. Learn from nature: See how everything gets acco mplishe d and how the mir acl e of life unfolds without dissatisfaction or un happiness. That' s why Jesus said: \"Look at the lilies, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin.\" If your overall situation is unsatisfactory or unpleasant, separate out this inst ant and surrender to what is. That' s th e flashlight cutting through the fog. Your state of consciousness then ceases to be controll ed by exte rnal condit ions. You are no longer com ing from reaction and resistance. Then look at the specifics of the situation. Ask yourself, \"Is there anything I can do to change the situation, im prove it, or re move myself from it?\" If so, you take appropriate action. Focus not on the 100 things that you will or may have to do at some future tim e but on the one thing t hat you can do now. This doesn' t mean you shoul d not do any pl anning. It may well be that planning is t he one thing you can do now. But make sure you don' t start to run \"m ental m ovies,\" project yourself into t he future, and so lose the Now. Any action you take may not bear fruit immediately. Until it does - do not resist what is. If th ere is no action you can take, and you cannot rem ove yourself from the situation either, th en use the situation to make you go m ore deeply int o surrende r, m ore deeply into the Now, m ore deeply into Being. When you enter this timeless dimension of the presen t, change often comes about in strange 131"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"ways without t he need for a great deal of doi ng on your part. Li fe becomes helpful and cooperative. If inner factors such as fear, guilt, or inertia prevented you from taking action, they will dissolve in th e light of your c onscious presence. Do not confuse surrender with an attitude of \"I can' t be bothered anym ore\" or \"I just don' t care anym ore.\" If you look at it closely, you will find that such an attitude is tainted with negativity in the form of hidden resentment and so is not surrender at all but masked resistance. As you surrende r, dir ect your attention inward to check if there is any trace of resista nce left insi de you. Be very alert when you do so; otherwise, a pocket of resist ance may continue to hide in some dark corner in the form of a thought or an unacknowledged em otion. From Mind Energ y To Spiritual Energy Letting go of resistance is easier sa id than done. I still don't see clearly how to let go. If you say it is by surrendering, the question remains: \"How?\" Start by acknowledging that t here is resistance. Be there wh en it happens, when the resistance arises. Observe how your mind creates it, how it labels the situati on, yourself, or others. Look at the thought pr ocess invol ved. Feel the energy of the em otion. By witnessing the resistance, you will see that it serves no purpose. By focusing a ll your attention on the Now, the unconscious resistance is made conscious, and that i s the end of it. You cannot be conscious and unhappy, con scious and in negativity. Negativity, unhappi ness, or suffering i n whatever form means that there is resistance, and resistance is al ways unconscious. Surely I can be conscious of my unhappy feelings? Would you choose unhappiness? If you did not choose it, how did it arise? What is its purpose? Who is keeping it alive? You sa y that you are conscious of your unhappy feelings, but the trut h is that you are iden tified with them an d keep the process alive through com pulsive thinki ng. All that i s unconscious. If you were conscious, that is to say totally present in the Now, all nega tivity would dissol ve alm ost instantly. It could not survi ve in your presence. It can only survive in your absence. Even the pain-body cannot survive for l ong in your presence. You keep your unha ppiness ali ve by gi ving it tim e. That is its li feblood. Rem ove time through i ntense present-m oment awareness and it dies. But do you want it to die? Have you truly had enough? Who would you be without it? Until you practice surrender, the spiritua l di mension is som ething you read about, talk about, get excited about, write books about, think about, be lieve in - or don' t, as 132"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"the case may be. It m akes no difference. Not until you surrender does it become a living reality in your life.

Through surrender, spirit ual energy comes into t his w orld. It creates no suffering for yourself, for ot her humans, or any other l ife form on the planet. Unlike mi nd energy, it does not pollute the earth, and it is not subject to the law of polari ties, which dictates that nothi ng can exist without its opposite, that there can be no good wit hout bad. Those who ru n on m ind energy, which is still the vast m ajority of the Ea rths population, remain unaware of the existence of spiritual energy. It belongs to a different order of reality and will create a different world when a sufficient num ber of hum ans enter the surrendered state and so become totally fre e of negativity. If the Eart h is to survive, this will be the energy of those who inhabit it. Jesus referred to thi s energy when he ma de his fam ous prophetic st atement in the Serm on on the Mount: \"Blessed are the gentle ; they shall have the earth for their possession.\" It is a silent but intense pres ence that dissolves the unconscious patterns of the m ind. They may still remain activ e fo r a while, but they won' t run your life anym ore. The external condit ions that were being resisted also tend to shift or dissol ve quickly through surrender. It is a powerful transformer of situations and people. If conditions do not sh ift immediately, your accep tance of the Now enables you to ri se above them. E ither way, you are free. Surrender In Perso nal Relationships What about people who want to use me, manipulate or cont rol me? Am I to surrender to them? They are cut off from Being, so they unconsciousl y attem pt to get energy and power from you. It i s true that only an unconsc ious person will try to use or m anipulate others, but it is equally true th at only an unconscious person can be used and manipulated. If you resist or fight uncons cious behavior in others, you become unconscious yourself. But surre nder doesn' t m ean that you allow yourself to be used by unconscious people. Not at all. It is perfectly possi ble to say \"no\" firmly and clearly to a person or to wa lk away from a situation and be in a state of comp lete inner nonresistance at the sam e time. When yo u say \"no\" to a person or a situation, let it com e not from reaction but from insight, fro m a clear realization of what is right or 133"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"not right for you at that m oment.

Speak up or do som ething to bri ng about a change in the situation - or rem ove yourself from it. Ta ke responsibility for your life. Do not pollute yo ur beautiful, radiant inne r Being nor the Earth with negativity. Do not give unhapp iness in any form whatsoever a dwelling place inside you. If you cannot take action, for exam ple if you are i n prison, the n you have two choi ces left: resist ance or surrender. Bondage or inner freedom from external conditi ons. Suffering or inner peace. Is nonresi stance also to be practiced in the exter nal conduct of our lives, such as nonresistance to violence, or is it someth ing that just concerns our inner life? You only need to be concerned with the inner aspect. That is primar y. Of course, that will also transform the conduct of your ou ter life, your relationships, and so on. Your relationships w ill be changed profoundl y by surrender. If you can never accept what is, by im plicati on you will not be ab le to accep t anybody the way they are. Yo u will judge, criticize, label, reject, or atte mpt to change people. Furtherm ore, if you continuously make the Now into a m eans to an end in the future, you will also make every person you encounter or relate with into a means to an end. The relationshi p - the hum an being - i s then of secondary i mpor tance to you, or of no im portance at all. What you can get out of t he relationshi p is prim ary - be it material gain, a sense of power, physical pleasure, or some form of ego gratification. Let me illustrate how surrender can work in relationships. When you become invol ved in an argument or some conflict situation, perhaps with a partner or someone close to you, start by observi ng how defensive you becom e as your own positi on is attacked, or feel the force of your own a ggression as you attack the other person' s position. Observe the attach ment to your views and opinions. Feel the mental-emotional energy behind your need to be right and make the other person wrong. That' s the energy of t he egoic m ind. You m ake it cons cious by acknowledgi ng it, by feeli ng it as ful ly as possi ble. Then one day, in the m iddle of an argum ent, you will suddenly realize that you have a choi ce, and you m ay decide to drop your own reaction - just to see what happens. You su rrender. I don't mean dropping the reacti on 134"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"just verbally by saying \"Okay, you are right ,\" with a look on your face that says, \"I am above all this childish unc onsciousness.\" That's just di splacing the resistance to another level, with the egoic m ind still in charge, claim ing superiority. I am speaking of letting go of the entire mental-em otional energy field inside you that was fighting for power. The ego is cunning, so you have to be very al ert, very present, a nd totally honest with yourself to see whether you ha ve truly reli nquished your i dent ification with a m ental positi on and so freed yourself from your m ind. If you sudde nly feel very light, clear and deeply at peace, that is an unmistaka ble sign that you have truly surrendered. Then observe what happens to the other person' s mental position as you no longer energize it through resistance. When identification with m ental positions is out of the way, true comm unication begins. What about nonresist ance in the face of violence, aggression, and the like? Nonresistance doesn' t necessarily m ean doi ng nothing. All it m eans is that any \"doing\" be comes nonreactive. Remem ber t he deep wisdom underlying the practice o f Eastern martial arts: don' t resist the opponent' s force. Yield to overcom e. Having said that, \"doing not hing\" when you are in a state of in tense presence is a very powerful transformer and healer of situ ations and peopl e. In Taoism, there is a ter m call ed wu wei, which is usually translated as \"actionless activity' or \"sitting quietly doing not hing.\" In ancient China, this was regarded as one of the highest achievements or vi rtues. It is radically di fferent from inactivity in the ordinary sta te of consciousness, or rather unconsciousn ess, which stems from fear, inertia, or indecision. The real \"doing nothi ng\" im plies inner nonresis tance and intense alertness. On the other hand, if action is requi red, you will no longer react from y our conditioned m ind, but you w ill respond to the situati on out of your consc ious presence. In that st ate, your m ind is fr ee of concepts, including t he concept of nonviolence. So who can pr edict what you will do? The ego believes that in your resistance lies your st rength, whereas in truth resistance cuts you off from Being, the only place of true power. Resistance is weakness and fear m asquerading a s strength. What the ego sees as weakness is your Being in its purit y, innocence, and power. Wh at it sees as strength is weakness. So the ego exists in a continuous resistance-mode and plays counterfeit role s to cover up your \"weakness,\" which in truth is your power. 135"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Until there is surrender, unconscious role-p laying constitutes a large p art of human interaction. In surrender, you no longe r n eed ego defenses a nd false masks. You becom e very sim ple, very real. \"That' s da ngerous,\" says the ego. \"You' ll get hurt. You' ll become vulnerable.\" What the ego doesn' t know, of course, is that onl y through the letting go of resist ance, thro ugh becom ing \"vulnerabl e,\" can you discover your true and essential invulnerability. Transforming Illness Into Enlightenment If someone is seriously ill and completely accepts their conditi on and surrenders to the illness, would they not have given up their will to get back to health? The determination to fight the illness woul d not be there any more, would it? Surrender is inner acceptance of what is without any reservations. We are talking about your life - thi s instant - not the condit ions or circum stances of your life, not what I call your life situation. We have spoken about this already. With regard to illness, this is what it means. Illness is part of your life situation. As such, it has a past and a future. Past and future form an uninterrupted continuum , unless the redeem ing power of t he Now is activated t hrough your conscious presence. As you know, underneath the various condit ions that m ake up your l ife situation, which exists in tim e, there is something deeper, more essential: your Life, your very Being in the tim eless Now. As there are no problems in the Now, there is no illness either. The belief in a la bel that someone attaches to your condition keeps the condition in place, em powers it, and makes a seem ingly solid r eality out of a tem porary im balance. It gives it not only reality and solidity but also a continuity in tim e that it did not have before. By focusing on this instant and refraining from labeling it m entally, illness is reduced to one or se veral of t hese factors: physic al pain, weakness, discom fort, or di sabil ity. That is what you surrender to - now. You do no t surrender to the idea of \"illness.\" Allow the suffering to force you int o the present m oment, into a state of intense conscious presence. Use it for enlightenment. Surrender does not t ransform what is, at l eas t not di rectly. Surrender tra nsform s you. When you are transform ed, your whole world is transform ed, because the world is only a reflection. We spoke about this earlier. If you l ooked in t he m irror and did not like what you saw, you would have to be mad to attack the im age in the m irror. That is precisely what you do when you are in a state of nonacceptance. And, of course, if you attack the im age, it attacks you back. If you accept the im age, no m atter what it is, if you become friendly toward it, it cannot not become friendly toward you. This is how you change the world. 136"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Illness is not t he problem. You are the pr oblem - as long a s the egoi c m ind is in control. When you are ill or disabled, do not feel that you have failed in som e way, do not feel guilt y. Do not bl ame life for treating you unfairly, but do not bla me yourself either. All that is resistance. If you have a major illness, use it for enlightenment. Anything \"bad\" that happens in your life - use it for enlight enm ent. Withdraw time from the illness. Do not give it any past or future. Let it force you into intense present-moment awareness - an d see what happens. Beco me an alchemist.

The condition that is labeled \"illness\" ha s nothi ng to do with who you t ruly are. When Dis aster Strikes As far as the still unconscious majority of the population is concerned, only a critical lim it-situation has the potential to crack the ha rd shell of the ego and force th em in to surrender and so into the awakened state. A lim it-situation arises when through some disaster, drastic upheaval, deep loss, or su ffering your whol e world is shattered and doesn' t make sense anym ore. It is an en counter with death, be it physical or psychol ogical. The egoic m ind, the creator of this world, colla pses. Out of the ashes of the old world, a new world can then come into being. There is no guarantee, of course, that even a lim it-situation will do it, but the potential i s always there. Some people' s resist ance to what is even intensifies in such a situation, and so it beco mes a descent into hell. In others, the re may onl y be partia l surrender, but even that will give them a certa in depth and serenity that were not there before. Parts of the ego she ll break off, and this all ows sm all am ounts of the radiance and peace that lie beyond t he m ind to shine through. Lim it-situations have produced many miracl es. There have b een murderers in death row waiting for execution who, in the last few hours of thei r lives, experienced the egoless state and the deep joy and peace t hat come with it. The inner resistance to the situation they found them selv es in became so intense as to produce unbearable suf- fering, and there was nowhere to run and nothi ng t o do t o escape it, not e ven a m ind- projected future. So they we re forced into com plete ac ceptance of the unacceptable. They were forced into surrender. In this wa y, they were able to enter the state of grace with which comes redemption: compl ete rel ease fro m the past. Of course, it is 137"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"not really the limit-situation that makes r oom for the miracle of grace and redemption but the act of surrender. So whenever any kind of disaster strike s, or something goes seriously \"wrong\" - illness, disability, loss of hom e or fortune or of a socially defined identity, break-up of a close relationship, death or suffer ing of a loved one, or your own im pending death - know that there is another side to it, that you are just one step away from something incredible: a co mplete alch emi cal trans mutation of the base metal of pain and sufferi ng into gol d. That on e step is called surrender. I do not mean to say that you will become happy in such a situation. You will not. But fear and pain will become transmuted in to an inner peace and serenity that come from a ver y deep place - from t he Un manifested itself. It is \"the peace of God, which passes all understanding.\" Com pared to that, happiness is qui te a shallow thing. With this radiant peace comes the realization - not on the level of mind but within the depth of your Being - that you are indestructible, imm ortal. Th is is not a belief: It is absolute certainty that needs no external evidence or proof from some secondary source. Transforming Suffering Into Peace I read about a stoic philosopher in ancient Gr eece who, when he was told that his son had died i n an accident, replied, \"I knew he was not immortal.\" Is that surrender? If it is, I don't want it. There are some sit uations in which surrender seems unnat ural and inhuman. Being cut off from your feelings is not su rrender. But we don' t know what his inner state was when he said those words. In certain extrem e situations, it m ay still be impossible for you to accept theNow. Bu t you always get a seco nd chance at surrender. Your first chance is to surrender each mo me nt to the reality of that mo ment. Knowing that what is cannot be undone - because it alre ady is - you say yes to what is or accept what isn' t. Then you do what you have t o do, what ever the si tuation requires. If you abide in this state of acceptance, you creat e no m ore negativity, no m ore suffering, no more unhappiness. You then live in a stat e of nonresistance, a state of grace and light ness, free of struggle. Whenever you are unable to do that, whenever you m iss th at chance - either because you are not generating enough conscious pr esence to prevent som e habitual and unconscious resistance p attern from arising, or because the condition is so extreme as to be absolutely unacceptable to you - then you are cr eating some form of pain, some 138"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"form of suffering. It may look as if th e situation is creating the suffering, but ultim ately this is not so - your resistance is. Now here is your second chance at surrende r: If you cannot accept what is outsi de, then accept what is inside. If you cannot accept the exte rnal condition, accept the internal condition. This m eans: Do not resi st the pain. Allow it to be there. Surrender to the grief, despair, fear, loneliness, or whatever form th e suffering takes. Witness it without la beling it mentally. Em brace it. Then see how the m iracle of surrender transmutes deep suffering in to deep peace. This is you r crucifixion. Let it become your resurrection and ascension. I do not see how one can surrender t o su ffering. As you yourself point ed out, suffering i s non-surrender. How c ould you surrender to nonsurrender? Forget about surrender for a moment. When your pain is deep, all talk of surre nder will probably seem futile and meaningless anyway. When your pain is deep, you will likely have a strong urge to escape from it ra ther t han surrender to it. Y ou don' t want to feel what you feel. What could be m ore norm al? But there is no escape, no way out. There are many pseudo escapes - wo rk, drink, drugs, anger, projection, suppression, and so on - but t hey don' t free you from the pain. Suffering does not dim inish i n intensity when you make it unc onscious. When you deny em otional pain, everything you do or think as well as your relationships become contam inated with it. You broadcast it, so to speak , as the energy you emanate, and others will pick it up sublim inally. If t hey are unconscious, they ma y even feel co mp elled to attack or hurt you in some way, or you may hurt them in an unconscious projection of your pain. You attract and m anifest whatever corresponds to your inner state. When there is no way out, th ere is still always a way through. So don't turn away from the pain. Face it. Feel it fully. Feel it - don' t think about it! Express it if necess ary, but don't creat e a scri pt in your m ind aro und it. Give all your attention to the feeling, not to the person, event, or s ituation that seem s to have caused it. Don' t let the m ind use the pain to c reate a victim identity for yourself out of it. Feeling sorry for yourself and telling others your story will keep you stuck in suffering. Since it is im possible to get away from the feeling, the only possibili ty of change is to move into it; otherwise, nothing will shift. So give your com plete attention to what you feel, and refrain from mentally labeling it. As you go i nto the f eeling, be intensely alert. At first, it may seem like a dark and terrifyi ng place, and when the urge to turn away from it comes, observe it but don' t act on it. Keep putting your attention on the pain, keep feeli ng the grief, the fear, the dread, the loneliness, whatever it is. Stay alert , stay present - present with your whole Being, with every cell of your body. As you do 139"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"so, you are bringi ng a light into thi s darkness. This is the flame of your consciousness. At this st age, you don' t need to be c oncerned with surre nder anym ore. It has happened already. How? Full a ttention is full acceptance, is surrender. By giving full attention, you use the power of the Now, wh ich is the power of your presence. No hidden pocket of resistance can survi ve in it. Presence rem oves tim e. Without ti me, no sufferi ng, no negativity, can survi ve. The accep tance of suffering is a journey into death. Facing deep pain, allowing it to be, taking your attention into it, is to en ter death consciously. When you have died this death, you realize that there is no deat h - and there is nothing to fear. Only the ego dies. Imagine a ray of sunl ight that ha s forgotten it is an inse parable part of the sun and deludes itself into believing it has to fight for survival and create and cling to an identit y other than the sun. Would t he d eath of this del usion not be incredibly liberating? Do you want an easy death? Would you rath er di e without pain, without agony? Then die to the past every m oment, and let the l ight of your presence shine away the heavy, time-bound self you thought of as \"you.\" The Way Of The Cross There are many accounts of people who sa y they have found God through their deep suffering, and there is the Christi an expression \"the way of the cross,\" which I suppose points to t he same thing. We are concerned with not hing else here. Strictly speaking, they did not find God through their suffering, becau se suffering im plies resistance. They found God thr ough surrender, through total acceptance of what is, into which they were forced by their i ntense suffering. They m ust have realized on some lev el that their pain was self-created. How do you equate surrender with finding God? Since resistance is inseparable from th e min d, relinquishment of resistance - surrender - is the end of the m ind as your master, the im postor pretending to be \"you,\" the false god. All judgm ent and all negat ivit y dissol ve. The realm of Being, which had been obscured by the mind, then op ens up. Suddenly, a great stillness arises within you, an unfa thomable sense of peace.

Th ere can be no subject-object relationship here, no duality, no you and God. God-realization is the m ost natural thing there is. The amazing and i ncom prehensible fact is not that you can becom e conscious of God but that you are not conscious of God. The way of the cross that you mentioned is the old way to enlight enment, and until recently it was the on ly way. But don't dism iss it or underestimate its ef ficacy. It s till works. The way of the cross is a com plete reversal. It means that the worst thing in your l ife, your cross, turns i nto the best thing that ever happened to you, by forci ng you int o surrender, into \"death,\" forcing you to b ecom e as nothi ng, to become as God - because God, too, is no-thing. At this time, as far as the unconscious ma jority of hum ans is concerned, the way of the cross is still the only way. They will only awaken through further suffering, and enlightenment as a collective phenomenon will be predictabl y preceded by vast upheavals.

It is described, am ong other places , in the Book of Revelation or Apocalypse, though cloaked in obscure and som etimes im penetrable sym bology.

You m ay be one of them. Enlightenment through suffering - the way of th e cross - m eans to be forced int o the kingdom of heaven kicking and screaming. You finally surrender because you can' t stand the pain anymore, but the pain coul d go on for a long time until this happens. Enlightenment consciously chosen m eans to relinquish your attach men t to past and future and to make the Now the main focus of your li fe. It m eans choosing to dwell in the state of presence rather than in time. It m eans saying yes to what is. You then don' t need pain anym ore.

Time and pain are inseparable. The Po we r To Choose What about all t hose people who, it seems, actua lly want to suffer? I have a friend whose partner is phy sically abusive toward he r, and her previous relati onship was of a similar kind. Why does she c hoose such men, and why is she refusing to get out of that sit uati on now? Why do so many people actuall y choose pain? I know that the word choose is a favorite New Ag e term , but it isn' t entirely accurate in this context. It is m isleading to say that somebody \"chose\" a dysfunctional relationshi p or any other negative sit uation i n his or her life. Choice im plies consciousness - a high degree of conscious ness. Without it, you have no choice. Choice begins the m oment y ou disiden tify from the mind and its conditioned patterns, the m oment you be com e pres ent. Until you reach that point, you a re unconscious, spirit ually speaking. This mean s that you are com pelled to think, feel, and act in certain ways according to the condi tioning of your m ind. That is why Jesus said: \"Forgive them, for t hey know not wh at they do.\" This is not related to intelligence in the co nventional sense of th e word. I have met ma ny highly intellige nt and educated people who were also com pletely unconscious, which is to say com - pletely identified with their m ind. In f act, if mental development and increased knowledge are not counterbalanced by a corre sponding grow th in consciousness, the potential for unhappi ness and disaster is very great. Your friend is stuck in a relationship with an abusive partner, and not for the first time. Why ? No choice. Th e m ind, conditioned as it is by the past, always seeks to re- create what it knows and is fam iliar with. Even if it is painful, at least it is fam iliar. The m ind always adheres to the known. Th e unknown is dangerous because it has no control over it. That's why the m ind dislik es and ignores the present moment. Present- mo ment awaren ess creat es a g ap not only in the st ream of mind but also in the past- future continuum . Nothing trul y new and cr eative can come into thi s world except through that gap, that clear space of infinite possibil ity. So your fri end, being identifie d with her mind, may be re-c reating a pattern learned in the past in which intimacy and abuse are inseparably linked. A lternatively, she may be acting out a m ind pattern learned in early childhood according to which she is unworthy and deserves to be punished. It i s possible, too, that she lives a large part of her life through t he pain-body, which always seeks m ore pain on which to feed. Her partner has his own unconscious patterns, which com plement hers. Of course her situation i s self created, but who or wha t is the self that is doing the creating? A 142"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"mental-emotional pattern from the past, no more. Why m ake a self out of it? If you tell her that she has chosen her condition or situation, you are reinforcing her state of mind identification. But is her m ind pattern who she is? Is it her self? Is her true identity derived from the past? Show your friend how to be the observing presence behind her thoughts and her em otions. Tell her about the pain-body and how to free herself from it. Teach her the art of i nne r-body awareness. Demonstrate to her the meaning of presence. As soon as she is able to access the power of the Now, an d thereby break through her conditione d past, she will have a cho ice. Nobody chooses dysfunction, conf lict, pain. Nobody choose s insanity. They happen because th ere is not enough presence in you to dissolve the past, not enough light to dispel t he darkness. You are not fully here . You have not qui te woken up yet. In the meantime, the conditioned m ind is running your li fe. Sim ilarly, if you are one of th e m any people who have an i ssue with their parents, if you still harbor resentment a bout som ething they did or did not do, then you still believe that they had a choice - that they c ould have acted diffe rently. It always looks as if people had a choice, but that is an il lusion. As long as your m ind with its condi- tioned patterns runs your l ife, as long a s you are your m ind, what choice do you have? No ne. You are not even there. The mi nd-identified state is severely dysfunctional. It is a form of insanity. A lmost everyone is suffe ring from this illness in varying degrees. The m oment you realize this, there can be no m ore resentment. How can you resent someone' s illness? The only appropria te response is compassion. So that means nobody is responsible for what they do? I don' t like that idea. If you are run by your m ind, although you have no choice you will still suffer the consequences of your unconsciousness, a nd you will create further suffering. You will bear the burden of fear, conflict, prob lem s, an d pain. The suffering thus created will eventually force you out of your unconscious sta te. What you say about choice also applies to forgiveness, I su ppose. You need to be f ully conscious and surrender be fore you can forgive. \"Forgiveness\" is a term that has been in us e for 2,000 years, but most people ha ve a very limited view of what it means. You cannot truly forgive yourself or others as long as you derive your sense of self from the pa st.
