DICARLO Author of Towards a New World View Blanketed by an azuresky, the orange-yellow rays of the setting sun can, at special times, gift uswith a moment of such consider able beauty, we find ourselves momentarilystunned, with frozen gaze. The splendor of the moment so dazzles us, ourcompulsively chattering minds give pause, so as not to mentally whisk us away toa place other than the here-and-now. Bathed in luminescence, a door seems toopen to another reality, always present, yet rarely witnessed.Abraham Maslow called these “peak experiences,” since they represent the highmoments of life where we joyfully find ourselves catapulted beyond the confinesof the mundane and ordinary. He might just as well have called them “peek”experiences. During these expansive occasions, we sneak a glimpse of the eternalrealm of Being itself. If only for a brief moment in time, we come home to ourTrue Self. “Ah,” one might sigh, “so grand . . . if only I could stay here. Buthow do I take up permanent residence?“ During the past ten years, I havecommitted myself to finding out. During my search, I have been honored to engagein dialogue with some of the most daring, inspiring and insightful ”paradigmpioneers“ of our time: in medicine, science, psychology, business,religion/spirituality, and human potential. This diverse group of individuals isjoined by their commonly voiced insight that humanity is now taking a quantumleap forward in its evolutionary development. This change is accompanied by ashift in world view the basic picture we carry with us of ”the way things are.“A world view seeks to answer two fundamental questions, ”Who are we?“ and ”Whatis the nature of the Universe in which we live?” Our answers to these questionsdictate the quality and characteristics of our personal relationships withfamily, friends and employers/employees. When considered on a larger scale, theydefine societies.It should be of little surprise that the world view which is emerging calls intoquestion many of the things Western society holds to be true:MYTH #1 Humanity has reached the pinnacle of its development.Esalen co-founder Michael Murphy, drawing upon comparative religious studies,medical science, anthropology, and sports, has made a provocative case thatthere are more advanced stages of human development. As a person reaches theseadvanced levels of spiritual maturity, extraordinary capacities begin to blossomof love, vitality, personhood, bodily awareness, intuition, perception,communication, and volition. First step: to recognize they exist. Most people donot.Then, methods can be employed with conscious intention.MYTH #2 We are completely separate from each other, nature, and the Kosmos.This myth of “other-than-me” has been responsible for wars, the rape of theplanet, and all forms and expressions of human injustice. After alt, who intheir right mind would harm another if they experienced that person as part ofthemselves? Stan Grof, in his research of non-ordinary states of consciousness,summarizes by saying “the psyche and consciousness of each of us is, in the lastanalysis, commensurate with ”All-That-Is“ because there are no absoluteboundaries between the body/ego and the totality of existence.”Dr. Larry Dossey's Era-3 medicine, where the thoughts, attitudes, and healingintentions of one individual can influence the physiology of another person (incontrast to Era-z, prevailing mind-body medicine) is very well supported byscientific studies into the healing power of prayer. Now this can't happenaccording to the known principles of physics and world view of traditionalscience. Yet the preponderance of evidence suggests that indeed it does.MYTH #3 The physical world is all there is.Materialistically bound, traditional science assumes that anything that cannotbe measured, tested in a laboratory, or probed by the five senses or theirtechnological extensions simply doesn't exist. Ifs “not real.” The consequence:all of reality has been collapsed into physical reality. Spiritual, or what Iwould call nonphysical, dimensions of reality have been run out of town.This clashes with the “perennial philosophy,” that philosophical consensusspanning ages, religions, traditions, and cultures, which describes differentbut continuous dimensions of reality. These run from the most dense and leastconscious what we'd call “matter” to the least dense and most conscious, whichwe'd call spiritual.Interestingly enough, this extended, multidimensional model of reality issuggested by quantum theorists such as Jack Scarfetti who describes superluminaltravel. Other dimensions of reality are used to explain travel that occursfaster than the speed of light the ultimate of speed limits. Or consider thework of the legendary physicist, David Bohm, with his explicate (physical) andimplicate (non- physical) multidimensional model of reality.This is no mere theory the i982 Aspect Experiment in France demonstrated, thattwo once-connected quantum particles separated by vast distances remainedsomehow connected. If one particle was changed, the other changed instantly.Scientists don't know the mechanics of how this faster-than-the-speed-of-lighttravel can happen, though some theorists suggest that this connection takesplace via doorways into higher dimensions.So contrary to what those who pledge their allegiance to the traditionalparadigm might think, the influential, pioneering individuals I spoke with feltthat we have not reached the pinnacle of human development, we are connected,rather than separate, from all of life, and that the full spectrum ofconsciousness encompasses both physical and a multitude of nonphysicaldimensions of reality.At core, this new world view involves seeing yourself, others, and all of life,not through the eyes of our small, earthly self that lives in time and is bornin time. But rather through the eyes of the soul, our Being, the True Self. Oneby one,people are jumping to this higher orbit. With his book, The Power of Now,Eckhart Tolle rightfully takes his place among this special group of world-class teachers. Eckharts message: the problem of humanity is deeply rooted inthe mind itself. Or rather, our misidentification with mind.Our drifting awareness, our tendency to take the path of least resistance bybeing less than fully awake to the present moment, creates a void. And thetime-bound mind, which has been designed to be a useful servant, compensates byproclaiming itself master. Like a butterfly flittering from one flower toanother, the mind engages past experiences or, projecting its ownmade-for-television movie, anticipates what is to come. Seldom do we findourselves resting in the oceanic depth of the here and now. For it is here inthe Now where we find our True Self, which lies behind our physical body,shifting emotions, and chattering mind.The crowning glory of human development rests not in our ability to reason andthink, though this is what distinguishes us from animals. Intellect, likeinstinct, is merely a point along the way. Our ultimate destiny is to re-connect with our essential Being and express from our extraordinary, divinereality in the ordinary physical world, moment by moment. Easy to say, yet rareare those who have attained the further reaches of human development.Fortunately, there are guides and teachers to help us along the way. As ateacher and guide, Eckhart's formidable power lies not in his adept ability todelight us with entertaining stories, make the abstract concrete, or provideuseful technique. Rather, his magic is seated in his personal experience, as onewho knows. As a result, there is a power behind his words found only in the mostcelebrated of spiritual teachers. By living from the depths of this GreaterReality, Eckhart clears an energetic pathway for others to join him.And what if others do? Surely the world as we know it would change for thebetter. Values would shift in the flotsam of vanishing fears that have beenfunneled away through the whirlpool of Being itself. A new civilization would beborn.“Where's the proof of this Greater Reality?” you ask. I offer only an analogy. Abattery of scientists can get together and tell you about all the scientificproof for the fact that bananas are bitter. But all you have to do is taste one,once, to realize that there is this whole other aspect to bananas. Ultimately,proof lies not in intellectual arguments, but in being touched in some way bythe sacred within and without.Eckhart Tolle masterfully opens us to that possibility.Russell E.

It feels now as if I amtalking about some past lifetime or somebody else's life.One night not long after my twenty-ninth birthday, I woke up in the early hourswith a feeling of absolute dread. I had woken up with such a feeling many timesbefore, but this time it was more intense than it had ever been. The silence ofthe night, the vague outlines of the furniture in the dark room,the distant noise of a passing train everything felt so alien, so hostile, andso utterly meaningless that it created in me a deep loathing of the world. Themost loathsome thing of all, however, was my own existence. What was the point mcontinuing to live with this burden of misery? Why carry on with this continuousstruggle? I could feel that a deep longing for annihilation, for nonexistence,was now becoming much stronger than the instinctive desire to continue to live.“I cannot live with myself any longer.” This was the thought that kept repeatingitself in my mind. Then suddenly I became aware of what a peculiar thought itwas. \"Am I one or two? If I cannot live with myself, there must be two of me:the 'I' and the 'self' that 'I' cannot live with.“ ”Maybe,“ I thought, ”only oneof them is real.\"I was so stunned by this strange realization that my mind stopped. I was fullyconscious, but there were no more thoughts. Then I felt drawn into what seemedlike a vortex of energy. It was a slow movement at first and then accelerated. Iwas gripped by an intense fear, and my body started to shake. I heard the words“resist nothing,” as if spoken inside my chest. I could feel myself being suckedinto a void. It felt as if the void was inside myself rather than outside.Suddenly,there was no more fear, and I let myself fall into that void. I have norecollection of what happened after that.I was awakened by the chirping of a bird outside the window. I had never heardsuch a sound before. My eyes were still closed, and I saw the image of aprecious diamond. Yes, if a diamond could make a sound, this is what it would belike. I opened my eyes. The first light of dawn was filtering through thecurtains. Without any thought, I felt, I knew, that there is infinitely more tolight than we realize. That soft luminosity filtering through the curtains waslove itself. Tears came into my eyes. I got up and walked around the room. Irecognized the room, and yet I knew that I had never truly seen it before.Everything was fresh and pristine, as if it had just come into existence. Ipicked up things, a pencil, an empty bottle, marveling at the beauty andaliveness of it all.That day I walked around the city in utter amazement at the miracle of life onearth, as if I had just been born into this world.For the next five months, I lived in a state of uninterrupted deep peace andbliss. After that, it diminished somewhat in intensity, or perhaps it justseemed to because it became my natural state. I could still function in theworld, although I realized that nothing I ever did could possibly add anythingto what I already had.I knew, of course, that something profoundly significant had happened to me, butI didn't understand it at all. It wasn't until several years later, after I hadread spiritual texts and spent time with spiritual teachers, that I realizedthat what everybody was looking for had already happened to me. I understoodthat the intense pressure of suffering that night must have forced myconsciousness to withdraw from its identification with the unhappy and deeplyfearful self, which is ultimately a fiction of the mind. This withdrawal musthave been so complete that this false, suffering self immediately collapsed,just as if a plug had been pulled out of an inflatable toy. What was left thenwas my true nature as the ever-present I am: consciousness in its pure stateprior to identification with form. Later I also learned to go into that innertimeless and deathless realm that I had originally perceived as a void andremain fully conscious. I dwelt in states of such indescribable bliss andsacredness that even the original experience I just described pales incomparison. A time came when, for a while, I was left with nothing on thephysical plane. I had no relationships, no job, no home, no socially definedidentity. I spent almost two years sitting on park benches in a state of themost intense joy.But even the most beautiful experiences come and go. More fundamental, perhaps,than any experience is the undercurrent of peace that has never left me sincethen. Sometimes it is very strong, almost palpable, and others can feel it too.At other times, it is somewhere in the background, like a distant melody.Later, people would occasionally come up to me and say: “I want what you have.Can you give it to me, or show me how to get it?” And I would say: “You have italready. You just can't feel it because your mind is making too much noise.”That answer later grew into the book that you are holding in your hands.Before I knew it, I had an external identity again. I had become a spiritualteacher."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWTHE TRUTH THAT IS WITHIN YOUThis book represents the essence of my work, as far as it can be conveyed inwords, with individuals and small groups of spiritual seekers during the pastten years, in Europe and in North America. In deep love and appreciation, Iwould like to thank those exceptional people for their courage, theirwillingness to embrace inner change, thought that kept repeating itself in mymind. Then suddenly I became aware of what a peculiar thought it was. “Am I oneor two? If I cannot live with myself, there must be two of me: the 'I' and the'self' that 'I' cannot live with.” “Maybe,” I thought, “only one of them isreal.” their challenging questions, and their readiness to listen. This bookwould not have come into existence without them. They belong to what is as yet asmall but fortunately growing minority of spiritual pioneers: people who arereaching a point where they become capable of breaking out of inheritedcollective mind-patterns that have kept humans in bondage to suffering for eons.I trust that this book will find its way to those who are ready for such radicalinner transformation and so act as a catalyst for it. I also hope that it willreach many others who will find its content worthy of consideration, althoughthey may not be ready to fully live or practice it. It is possible that at alater time, the seed that was sown when reading this book will merge with theseed of enlightenment that each human being carries within, and suddenly thatseed will sprout and come alive within them.The book in its present form originated, often spontaneously, in response toquestions asked by individuals in seminars, meditation classes and privatecounseling sessions, and so I have kept the question-and-answer format. Ilearned and received as much in those classes and sessions as the questioners.Some of the questions and answers I wrote down almost verbatim. Others aregeneric, which is to say I combined certain types of questions that werefrequently asked into one, and extracted the essence from different answers toform one generic answer. Sometimes, in the process of writing, an entirely newanswer came that was more profound or insightful than anything I had everuttered. Some additional questions were asked by the editor so as to providefurther clarification of certain points.You will find that from the first to the last page, thedialogues continuously alternate between two different levels. On one level, Idraw your attention to what is false in you. I speak of the nature of humanunconsciousness and dysfunction as well as its most common behavioralmanifestations, from conflict in relationships to warfare between tribes ornations. Such knowledge is vital, for unless you learn to recognize the false asfalse as not you there can be no lasting transformation, and you would alwaysend up being drawn back into illusion and into some form of pain. On this level,I also show you how not to make that which is false in you into a self and intoa personal problem,for that is how the false perpetuates itself. On another level, I speak of aprofound transformation of human consciousness not as a distant futurepossibility, but available now no matter who or where you are. You are shown howto free yourself from enslavement to the mind, enter into this enlightened stateof consciousness and sustain it in everyday life.On this level of the book, the words are not always concerned with information,but often designed to draw you into this new consciousness as you read. Againand again, I endeavor to take you with me into that timeless state of intenseconscious presence in the Now, so as to give you a taste of enlightenment. Untilyou are able to experience what I speak of, you may find those passages somewhatrepetitive. As soon as you do, however, I believe you will realize that theycontain a great deal of spiritual power, and they may become for you the mostrewarding parts of the book. Moreover, since every person carries the seed ofenlightenment within, I often address myself to the knower in you who dwellsbehind the thinker, the deeper self that immediately recognizes spiritual truth,resonates with it, and gains strength from it.The pause symbol ¤ after certain passages is a suggestion that you may want tostop reading for a moment, become still, and feel and experience the truth ofwhat has just been said. There may be other places in the text where you will dothis naturally and spontaneously.As you begin reading the book, the meaning of certain words, such as “Being” or“presence,” may not be entirely clear to you at first. Just read on. Questionsor objections may occasionally come into your mind as you read. They willprobably be answered later in the book, or they may turn out to be irrelevant asyou go more deeply into the teaching and into yourself.Don't read with the mind only. Watch out for any “feeling-response” as you readand a sense of recognition from deep within. I cannot tell you any spiritualtruth that deep within you don't know already. All I can do is remind you ofwhat you have forgotten. Living knowledge, ancient and yet ever new, is thenactivated and released from within every cell of your body.The mind always wants to categorize and compare, but this book will work betterfor you if you do not attempt to compare its terminology with that of otherteachings; otherwise, you will probably become confused. I use words such as“mind,” “happiness,” and “consciousness” in ways that do not necessarilycorrelate with other teachings. Don't get attached to any words. They are onlystepping stones, to be left behind as quickly as possible.When I occasionally quote the words of Jesus or the Buddha, from A Course inMiracles or from other teachings, I do so not in order to compare, but to drawyour attention to the fact that in essence there is and always has been only onespiritual teaching, although it comes in many forms. Some of these forms, suchas the ancient religions, have become so overlaid with extraneous matter thattheir spiritual essence has become almost completely obscured by it. To a largeextent, therefore, their deeper meaning is no longer recognized and theirtransformative power lost. When I quote from the ancient religions or otherteachings, it is to reveal their deeper meaning and thereby restore theirtransformative power particularly for those readers who are followers of thesereligions or teachings. I say to them: there is no need to go elsewhere for thetruth. Let me show you how to go more deeply into what you already have.Mostly, however, I have endeavored to use terminology that is as neutral aspossible in order to reach a wide range of people. This book can be seen as arestatement for our time of that one timeless spiritual teaching, the essence ofall religions. It is not derived from external sources, but from the one trueSource within, so it contains no theory or speculation. I speak from innerexperience, and if at times I speak forcefully, it is to cut through heavylayers of mental resistance and to reach that place within you where you alreadyknow, just as I know, and where the truth is recognized when it is heard. Thereis then a feeling of exaltation and heightened aliveness, as something withinyou says: “Yes. I know this is true.”"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOW"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWYOU ARE NOT YOUR MIND"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWTHE GREATEST OBSTACLE TO ENLIGHTENMENTEnlightenment what is that?A beggar had been sitting by the side of a road for over thirty years. One day astranger walked by. “Spare some change?” mumbled the beggar, mechanicallyholding out his old baseball cap. “I have nothing to give you,” said thestranger. Then he asked: “What's that you are sitting on? ” “ Nothing,” repliedthe beggar. “Just an old box. I have been sitting on it for as long as I canremember. ” “ Ever looked inside?” asked the stranger. “No,” said the beggar.“Whats the point? There's nothing in there.” “Have a look inside,” insisted thestranger. The beggar managed to pry open the lid. With astonishment, disbelief,and elation, he saw that the box was filled with gold.I am that stranger who has nothing to give you and who is telling you to lookinside. Not inside any box, as in the parable, but somewhere even closer, insideyourself.“But I am not a beggar,” I can hear you say.Those who have not found their true wealth, which is the radiant joy of Beingand the deep, unshakable peace that comes with it, are beggars, even if theyhave great material wealth. They are looking outside for scraps of pleasure orfulfillment, for validation, security, or love, while they have a treasurewithin that not only includes all those things but is infinitely greater thananything the world can offer.The word enlightenment conjures up the idea of some superhuman accomplishment,and the ego likes to keep it that way, but it is simply your natural state offelt oneness with Being. It is a state of connectedness with somethingimmeasurable and indestructible, something that, almost paradoxically, isessentially you and yet is much greater than you. It is finding your true naturebeyond name and form. The inability to feel this connectedness gives rise to theillusion of separation, from yourself and from the world around you. You thenperceive yourself, consciously or unconsciously, as an isolated fragment. Feararises, and conflict within and without becomes the norm.I love the Buddha's simple definition of enlightenment as “the end ofsuffering.” There is nothing superhuman in that, is there? Of course, as adefinition, it is incomplete. It only tells you what enlightenment is not: nosuffering. But what's left when there is no more suffering? The Buddha is silenton that, and his silence implies that you'll have to find out for yourself. Heuses a negative definition so that the mind cannot make it into something tobelieve in or into a superhuman accomplishment, a goal that is impossible foryou to attain. Despite this precaution, the majority of Buddhists still believethat enlightenment is for the Buddha, not for them, at least not in thislifetime.You used the word Being. Can you explain what you mean by that?Being is the eternal, ever-present One Life beyond the myriad forms of life thatare subject to birth and death. However, Being is not only beyond but also deepwithin every form as its innermost invisible and indestructible essence. Thismeans that it is accessible to you now as your own deepest self, your truenature. But don't seek to grasp it with your mind. Don't try to understand it.You can know it only when the mind is still. When you are present, when yourattention is fully and intensely in the Now, Being can be felt, but it can neverbe understood mentally. To regain awareness of Being and to abide in that stateof “feeling- realization” is enlightenment.¤When you say Being, are you talking about God? If you are, then why don't yousay it?The word God has become empty of meaning through thousands of years of misuse. Iuse it sometimes, but I do so sparingly. By misuse, I mean that people who havenever even glimpsed the realm of the sacred, the infinite vastness behind thatword, use it with great conviction, as if they knew what they are talking about.Or they argue against it, as if they knew what it is that they are denying. Thismisuse gives rise to absurd beliefs, assertions, and egoic delusions, such as“My or our God is the only true God, and your God is false,” or Nietzsche'sfamous statement “God is dead.”The word God has become a closed concept. The moment the word is uttered, amental image is created, no longer, perhaps, of an old man with a white beard,but still a mental representation of someone or something outside you, and, yes,almost inevitably a male someone or something.Neither God nor Being nor any other word can define or explain the ineffablereality behind the word, so the only important question is whether the word is ahelp or a hindrance in enabling you to experience That toward which it points.Does it point beyond itself to that transcendental reality, or does it lenditself too easily to becoming no more than an idea in your head that you believein, a mental idol?The word Being explains nothing, but nor does God. Being, however, has theadvantage that it is an open concept. It does not reduce the infinite invisibleto a finite entity. It is impossible to form a mental image of it. Nobody canclaim exclusive possession of Being. It is your very essence, and it isimmediately accessible to you as the feeling of your own presence, therealization I am that is prior to I am this or I am that. So it is only a smallstep from the word Being to the experience of Being.¤What is the greatest obstacle to experiencing this reality?Identification with your mind, which causes thought to become compulsive. Not tobe able to stop thinking is a dreadful affliction, but we don't realize thisbecause almost everybody is suffering from it, so it is considered normal. Thisincessant mental noise prevents you from finding that realm of inner stillnessthat is inseparable from Being. It also creates a false mind-made self thatcasts a shadow of fear and suffering. We will look at all that in more detaillater.The philosopher Descartes believed that he had found the most fundamental truthwhen he made his famous statement: “I think, therefore I am.” He had, in fact,given expression to the most basic error, to equate thinking with Being andidentity with thinking. The compulsive thinker, which means almost everyone,lives in a state of apparent separateness, in an insanely complex world ofcontinuous problems and conflict, a world that reflects the ever- increasingfragmentation of the mind. Enlightenment is a state of wholeness, of being “atone” and therefore at peace. At one with life in its manifested aspect, theworld, as well as with your deepest self and life unmanifested at one withBeing. Enlightenment is not only the end of suffering and of continuous conflictwithin and without, but also the end of the dreadful enslavement to incessantthinking. What an incredible liberation this is! Identification with your mindcreates an opaque screen of concepts, labels, images, words, judgments, anddefinitions that blocks all true relationship. It comes between you andyourself, between you and your fellow man and woman, between you and nature,between you and God. It is this screen of thought that creates the illusion ofseparateness,the illusion that there is you and a totally separate “other.” You then forgetthe essential fact that, underneath the level of physical appearances andseparate forms, you are one with all that is. By “forget,” I mean that you canno longer feel this oneness as self-evident reality. You may believe it to betrue, but you no longer know it to be true. A belief may be comforting. Onlythrough your own experience, however, does it become liberating.Thinking has become a disease. Disease happens when things get out of balance.For example, there is nothing wrong with cells dividing and multiplying in thebody, but when this process continues in disregard of the total organism, cellsproliferate and we have disease.The mind is a superb instrument if used rightly. Used wrongly, however, itbecomes very destructive. To put it more accurately, it is not so much that youuse your mind wrongly you usually don't use it at all. It uses you. This is thedisease. You believe that you are your mind. This is the delusion. Theinstrument has taken you over.I don't quite agree. It is true that I do a lot of aimless thinking, like mostpeople, but I can still choose to use my mind to get and accomplish things, andI do that all the time.Just because you can solve a crossword puzzle or build an atom bomb doesn't meanthat you use your mind. Just as dogs love to chew bones, the mind loves to getits teeth into problems. Thats why it does crossword puzzles and builds atombombs. You have no interest in either. Let me ask you this: can you be free ofyour mind whenever you want to? Have you found the “off” button?You mean stop thinking altogether? No, I can't, except maybe for a moment ortwo.Then the mind is using you. You are unconsciously identified with it, so youdon't even know that you are its slave. It's almost as if you were possessedwithout knowing it,and so you take the possessing entity to be yourself. The beginning of freedomis the realization that you are not the possessing entity the thinker. Knowingthis enables you to observe the entity. The moment you start watching thethinker, a higher level of consciousness becomes activated. You then begin torealize that there is a vast realm of intelligence beyond thought, that thoughtis only a tiny aspect of that intelligence. You also realize that all the thingsthat truly matter beauty, love, creativity, joy, inner peace arise from beyondthe mind. You begin to awaken.¤"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWFREEING YOURSELF FROM YOUR MINDWhat exactly do you mean by “watching the thinker”?When someone goes to the doctor and says, “I hear a voice in my head,” he or shewill most likely be sent to a psychiatrist. The fact is that, in a very similarway, virtually everyone hears a voice, or several voices, in their head all thetime: the involuntary thought processes that you don't realize you have thepower to stop. Continuous monologues or dialogues. You have probably come across“mad” people in the street incessantly talking or muttering to themselves. Well,thats not much different from what you and all other “normal” people do, exceptthat you don't do it out loud. The voice comments, speculates, judges, compares,complains, likes, dislikes, and so on. The voice isn't necessarily relevant tothe situation you find yourself in at the time; it may be reviving the recent ordistant past or rehearsing or imagining possible future situations. Here itoften imagines things going wrong and negative outcomes; this is called worry.Sometimes this soundtrack is accompanied by visual images or “mental movies.”Even if the voice is relevant to the situation at hand, it will interpret it interms of the past. This is because the voice belongs to your conditioned mind,which is the result of all your past history as well as of the collectivecultural mind-set you inherited. So you see and judge the present through theeyes of the past and get a totally distorted view of it. It is not uncommon forthe voice to be a person's own worst enemy. Many people live with a tormentor intheir head that continuously attacks and punishes them and drains them of vitalenergy. It is the cause of untold misery and unhappiness, as well as of disease.The good news is that you can free yourself from your mind. This is the onlytrue liberation. You can take the first step right now. Start listening to thevoice in your head as often as you can. Pay particular attention to anyrepetitive thought patterns, those old gramophone records that have been playingin your head perhaps for many years. This is what I mean by “watching thethinker,” which is another way of saying: listen to the voice in your head, bethere as the witnessing presence.When you listen to that voice, listen to it impartially. That is to say, do notjudge. Do not judge or condemn what you hear, for doing so would mean that thesame voice has come in again through the back door. You'll soon realize: thereis the voice, and here I am listening to it, watching it. This I am realization,this sense of your own presence, is not a thought. It arises from beyond themind.¤So when you listen to a thought, you are aware not only of the thought but alsoof yourself as the witness of the thought. A new dimension of consciousness hascome in. As you listen to the thought, you feel a conscious presence your deeperself behind or underneath the thought, as it were. The thought then loses itspower over you and quickly subsides, because you are no longer energizing themind through identification with it. This is the beginning of the end ofinvoluntary and compulsive thinking.When a thought subsides, you experience a discontinuity in the mental stream agap of “no-mind.” At first, the gaps will be short, a few seconds perhaps, butgradually they will become longer. When these gaps occur, you feel a certainstillness and peace inside you. This is the beginning of your natural state offelt oneness with Being, which is usually obscured by the mind. With practice,the sense of stillness and peace will deepen. In fact, there is no end to itsdepth. You will also feel a subtle emanation of joy arising from deep within:the joy of Being.It is not a trancelike state. Not at all. There is no loss of consciousnesshere. The opposite is the case. If the price of peace were a lowering of yourconsciousness, and the price of stillness a lack of vitality and alertness, thenthey would not be worth having. In this state of inner connectedness, you aremuch more alert, more awake than in the mind-identified state. You are fullypresent. It also raises the vibrational frequency of the energy field that giveslife to the physical body.As you go more deeply into this realm of no-mind, as it is sometimes called inthe East, you realize the state of pure consciousness. In that state, you feelyour own presence with such intensity and such joy that all thinking, allemotions, your physical body, as well as the whole external world becomerelatively insignificant in comparison to it. And yet this is not a selfish buta selfless state. It takes you beyond what you previously thought of as “yourself.” That presence is essentially you and at the same time inconceivablygreater than you. What I am trying to convey here may sound paradoxical or evencontradictory, but there is no other way that I can express it.¤Instead of “watching the thinker,” you can also create a gap in the mind streamsimply by directing the focus of your attention into the Now. Just becomeintensely conscious of the present moment. This is a deeply satisfying thing todo. In this way, you draw consciousness away from mind activity and create a gapof no-mind in which you are highly alert and aware but not thinking. This is theessence of meditation.In your everyday life, you can practice this by taking any routine activity thatnormally is only a means to an end and giving it your fullest attention, so thatit becomes an end in itself. For example, every time you walk up and down thestairs in your house or place of work, pay close attention to every step, everymovement, even your breathing. Be totally present. Or when you wash your hands,pay attention to all the sense perceptions associated with the activity: thesound and feel of the water, the movement of your hands, the scent of the soap,and so on. Or when you get into your car, after you close the door, pause for afew seconds and observe the flow of your breath. Become aware of a silent butpowerful sense of presence. There is one certain criterion by which you canmeasure your success in this practice: the degree of peace that you feel within.¤So the single most vital step on your journey toward enlightenment is this:learn to disidentify from your mind. Every time you create a gap in the streamof mind, the light of your consciousness grows stronger.One day you may catch yourself smiling at the voice in your head, as you wouldsmile at the antics of a child. This means that you no longer take the contentof your mind all that seriously, as your sense of self does not depend on it."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWENLIGHTENMENT: RISING ABOVE THOUGHTIsn't thinking essential in order to survive in this world?Your mind is an instrument, a tool. It is there to be used for a specific task,and when the task is completed, you lay it down. As it is, I would say about 8oto 90 percent of most people's thinking is not only repetitive and useless, butbecause of its dysfunctional and often negative nature, much of it is alsoharmful. Observe your mind and you will find this to be true. It causes aserious leakage of vital energy.This kind of compulsive thinking is actually an addiction. What characterizes anaddiction? Quite simply this:you no longer feel that you have the choice to stop. It seems stronger than you.It also gives you a false sense of pleasure, pleasure that invariably turns intopain. Why should we be addicted to thinking?Because you are identified with it, which means that you derive your sense ofself from the content and activity of your mind. Because you believe that youwould cease to be if you stopped thinking. As you grow up, you form a mentalimage of who you are, based on your personal and cultural conditioning. We maycall this phantom self the ego. It consists of mind activity and can only bekept going through constant thinking. The term ego means different things todifferent people, but when I use it here it means a false self, created byunconscious identification with the mind.To the ego, the present moment hardly exists. Only past and future areconsidered important. This total reversal of the truth accounts for the factthat in the ego mode the mind is so dysfunctional. It is always concerned withkeeping the past alive, because without it who are you? It constantly projectsitself into the future to ensure its continued survival and to seek some kind ofrelease or fulfillment there. It says: “One day, when this, that, or the otherhappens, I am going to be okay, happy, at peace.” Even when the ego seems to beconcerned with the present, it is not the present that it sees: It misperceivesit completely because it looks at it through the eyes of the past. Or it reducesthe present to a means to an end, an end that always lies in the mind-projectedfuture. Observe your mind and you'll see that this is how it works.The present moment holds the key to liberation. But you cannot find the presentmoment as long as you are your mind.I don't want to lose my ability to analyze and discriminate. I wouldn't mindlearning to think more clearly, in a more focused way, but I don't want to losemy mind. The gift of thought is the most precious thing we have. Without it, wewould just be another species of animal. The predominance of mind is no morethan a stage in the evolution of consciousness. We need to go on to the nextstage now as a matter of urgency; otherwise, we will be destroyed by the mind,which has grown into a monster. I will talk about this in more detail later.Thinking and consciousness are not synonymous. Thinking is only a small aspectof consciousness. Thought cannot exist without consciousness, but consciousnessdoes not need thought.Enlightenment means rising above thought, not filling back to a level belowthought, the level of an animal or a plant. In the enlightened state, you stilluse your thinking mind when needed, but in a much more focused and effective waythan before. You use it mostly for practical purposes, but you are free of theinvoluntary internal dialogue, and there is inner stillness. When you do useyour mind, and particularly when a creative solution is needed, you oscillateevery few minutes or so between thought and stillness, between mind and no-mind.No-mind is consciousness without thought. Only in that way is it possible tothink creatively, because only in that way does thought have any real power.Thought alone, when it is no longer connected with the much vaster realm ofconsciousness, quickly becomes barren, insane, destructive.The mind is essentially a survival machine. Attack and defense against otherminds, gathering, storing, and analyzing information this is what it is good at,but it is not at all creative. All true artists, whether they know it or not,create from a place of no-mind, from inner stillness. The mind then gives formto the creative impulse or insight. Even the great scientists have reported thattheir creative breakthroughs came at a time of mental quietude. The surprisingresult of a nation-wide inquiry among America's most eminent mathematicians,including Einstein, to find out their working methods, was that thinking “playsonly a subordinate part in the brief, decisive phase of the creative actitself.” So I would say that the simple reason why the majority of scientistsare not creative is not because they don't know how to think but because theydon't know how to stop thinking!It wasn't through the mind, through thinking, that the miracle that is life onearth or your body were created and are being sustained. There is clearly anintelligence at work that is far greater than the mind. How can a single humancell measuring 1/1,000 of an inch across contain instructions within its DNAthat would fill 1,000 books of 600 pages each? The more we learn about theworkings of the body, the more we realize just how vast is the intelligence atwork within it and how little we know. When the mind reconnects with that, itbecomes a most wonderful tool. It then serves something greater than itself."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWEMOTION: THE BODY'S REACTION TO YOUR MINDWhat about emotions? I get caught up in my emotions more than I do in my mind.Mind, in the way I use the word, is not just thought. It includes your emotionsas well as all unconscious mental- emotional reactive patterns. Emotion arisesat the place where mind and body meet. It is the body's reaction to your mind oryou might say, a reflection of your mind in the body. For example, an attackthought or a hostile thought will create a build-up of energy in the body thatwe call anger The body is getting ready to fight. The thought that you are beingthreatened, physically or psychologically, causes the body to contract, and thisis the physical side of what we call fear. Research has shown that strongemotions even cause changes in the biochemistry of the body. These biochemicalchanges represent the physical or material aspect of the emotion. Of course, youare not usually conscious of all your thought patterns, and it is often onlythrough watching your emotions that you can bring them into awareness.The more you are identified with your thinking, your likes and dislikes,judgments and interpretations, which is to say the less present you are as thewatching consciousness, the stronger the emotional energy charge will be,whether you are aware of it or not. If you cannot feel your emotions, if you arecut off from them, you will eventually experience them on a purely physicallevel, as a physical problem or symptom. A great deal has been written aboutthis in recent years, so we don't need to go into it here. A strong unconsciousemotional pattern may even manifest as an external event that appears to justhappen to you. For example, I have observed that people who carry a lot of angerinside without being aware of it and without expressing it are more likely to beattacked, verbally or even physically, by other angry people, and often for noapparent reason. They have a strong emanation of anger that certain people pickup subliminally and that triggers their own latent anger.If you have difficulty feeling your emotions, start by focusing attention on theinner energy field of your body. Feel the body from within. This will also putyou in touch with your emotions. We will explore this in more detail later.¤You sap that an emotion is the mind's reflection in the body. But sometimesthere is a conflict between the two: the mind saps “no” while the emotion saps\"yes,' or the other way around. If you really want to know your mind, the bodywill always give you a truthful reflection, so look at the emotion or ratherfeel it in your body. If there is an apparent conflict between them, the thoughtwill be the lie, the emotion will be the truth.Not the ultimate truth of who you are, but the relative truth of your state ofmind at that time.Conflict between surface thoughts and unconscious mental processes is certainlycommon. You may not yet be able to bring your unconscious mind activity intoawareness as thoughts, but it will always be reflected in the body as anemotion, and of this you can become aware. To watch an emotion in this way isbasically the same as listening to or watching a thought, which I describedearlier. The only difference is that, while a thought is in your head, anemotion has a strong physical component and so is primarily felt in the body.You can then allow the emotion to be there without being controlled by it. Youno longer are the emotion; you are the watcher, the observing presence. If youpractice this, all that is unconscious in you will be brought into the light ofconsciousness.So observing our emotions is as important as observing our thoughts?Yes. Make it a habit to ask yourself. Whats going on inside me at this moment?That question will point you in the right direction. But don't analyze, justwatch. Focus your attention within. Feel the energy of the emotion. If there isno emotion present, take your attention more deeply into the inner energy fieldof your body. It is the doorway into Being.¤ An emotion usually represents an amplified and energized thought pattern, andbecause of its often overpowering energetic charge, it is not easy initially tostay present enough to be able to watch it. It wants to take you over, and itusually succeeds unless there is enough presence in you.If you are pulled into unconscious identification with the emotion through lackof presence, which is normal, the emotion temporarily becomes “you.” Often avicious circle builds up between your thinking and the emotion: they feed eachother. The thought pattern creates a magnified reflection of itself in the formof an emotion, and the vibrational frequency of the emotion keeps feeding theoriginal thought pattern. By dwelling mentally on the situation, event, orperson that is the perceived cause of the emotion, the thought feeds energy tothe emotion, which in turn energizes the thought pattern, and so on.Basically, all emotions are modifications of one primordial, undifferentiatedemotion that has its origin in the loss of awareness of who you are beyond nameand form. Because of its undifferentiated nature, it is hard to find a name thatprecisely describes this emotion. “Fear” comes close, but apart from acontinuous sense of threat, it also includes a deep sense of abandonment andincompleteness. It may be best to use a term that is as undifferentiated as thatbasic emotion and simply call it “pain.” One of the main tasks of the mind is tofight or remove that emotional pain, which is one of the reasons for itsincessant activity, but all it can ever achieve is to cover it up temporarily.In fact, the harder the mind struggles to get rid of the pain, the greater thepain. The mind can never find the solution, nor can it afford to allow you tofind the solution, because it is itself an intrinsic part of the “problem.”Imagine a chief of police trying to find an arsonist when the arsonist is thechief of police. You will not be free of that pain until you cease to deriveyour sense of self from identification with the mind, which is to say from ego.The mind is then toppled from its place of power and Being reveals itself asyour true nature. Yes, I know what you are going to ask.I was going to ask: What about positive emotions such as love and joy?They are inseparable from your natural state of inner connectedness with Being.Glimpses of love and joy or brief moments of deep peace are possible whenever agap occurs in the stream of thought. For most people, such gaps happen rarelyand only accidentally, in moments when the mind is rendered “speechless,”sometimes triggered by great beauty, extreme physical exertion, or even greatdanger. Suddenly, there is inner stillness. And within that stillness there is asubtle but intense joy, there is love, there is peace.Usually, such moments are short-lived, as the mind quickly resumes itsnoise-making activity that we call thinking. Love, joy, and peace cannotflourish until you have freed yourself from mind dominance. But they are notwhat I would call emotions. They lie beyond the emotions, on a much deeperlevel. So you need to become fully conscious of your emotions and be able tofeel them before you can feel that which lies beyond them. Emotion literallymeans “disturbance.” The word comes from the Latin emovere, meaning “todisturb.”Love, joy, and peace are deep states of Being or rather three aspects of thestate of inner connectedness with Being. As such, they have no opposite. This isbecause they arise from beyond the mind. Emotions, on the other hand, being partof the dualistic mind, are subject to the law of opposites. This simply meansthat you cannot have good without bad. So in the unenlightened, mind-identifiedcondition, what is sometimes wrongly called joy is the usually short-livedpleasure side of the continuously alternating pain/pleasure cycle. Pleasure isalways derived from something outside you, whereas joy arises from within. Thevery thing that gives you pleasure today will give you pain tomorrow, or it willleave you, so its absence will give you pain. And what is often referred to aslove may be pleasurable and exciting for a while, but it is an addictiveclinging, an extremely needy condition that can turn into its opposite at theflick of a switch. Many “love” relationships, after the initial euphoria haspassed, actually oscillate between “love” and hate, attraction and attack.Real love doesn't make you suffer. How could it? It doesn't suddenly turn intohate, nor does real joy turn into pain. As I said, even before you areenlightened before you have freed yourself from your mind you may get glimpsesof true joy, true love, or of a deep inner peace, still but vibrantly alive.These are aspects of your true nature, which is usually obscured by the mind.Even within a \"normal'' addictive relationship, there can be moments when thepresence of something more genuine, something incorruptible, can be felt. Butthey will only be glimpses, soon to be covered up again through mindinterference. It may then seem that you had something very precious and lost it,or your mind may convince you that it was all an illusion anyway. The truth isthat it wasn't an illusion, and you cannot lose it. It is part of your naturalstate, which can be obscured but can never be destroyed by the mind. Even whenthe sky is heavily overcast, the sun hasn't disappeared. It's still there on theother side of the clouds.The Buddha says that pain or suffering arises through desire or craving and thatto be free of pain we need to cut the bonds of desire.All cravings are the mind seeking salvation or fulfillment in external thingsand in the future as a substitute for the joy of Being. As long as I am my mind,I am those cravings, those needs, wants, attachments, and aversions, and apartfrom them there is no 'I' except as a mere possibility, an unfulfilledpotential, a seed that has not yet sprouted. In that state, even my desire tobecome free or enlightened is just another craving for fulfillment or completionin the future. So don't seek to become free of desire or “achieve”enlightenment. Become present. Be there as the observer of the mind. Instead ofquoting the Buddha, be the Buddha, be “the awakened one,” which is what the wordbuddha means.Humans have been in the grip of pain for eons, ever since they fell from thestate of grace, entered the realm of time and mind, and lost awareness of Being.At that point, they started to perceive themselves as meaningless fragments inan alien universe, unconnected to the Source and to each other.Pain is inevitable as long as you are identified with your mind, which is to sayas long as you are unconscious, spiritually speaking. I am talking hereprimarily of emotional pain, which is also the main cause of physical pain andphysical disease. Resentment, hatred, self-pity, guilt, anger, depression,jealousy, and so on, even the slightest irritation, are all forms of pain. Andevery pleasure or emotional high contains within itself the seed of pain: itsinseparable opposite, which will manifest in time.Anybody who has ever taken drugs to get “high” will know that the higheventually turns into a low, that the pleasure turns into some form of pain.Many people also know from their own experience how easily and quickly anintimate relationship can turn from a source of pleasure to a source of pain.Seen from a higher perspective, both the negative and the positive polaritiesare faces of the same coin,are both part of the underlying pain that is inseparable from themind-identified egoic state of consciousness.There are two levels to your pain: the pain that you create now, and the painfrom the past that still lives on in your mind and body. Ceasing to create painin the present and dissolving past pain this is what I want to talk about now."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOW"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWCONSCIOUSNESS: THE WAY OUT OF PAIN"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWCREATE NO MORE PAIN IN THE PRESENTNobody's life is entirely free of pain and sorrow. Isn't it a question oflearning to live with them rather than trying to avoid them?The greater part of human pain is unnecessary. It is self- created as long asthe unobserved mind runs your life.The pain that you create now is always some form of nonacceptance, some form ofunconscious resistance to what is. On the level of thought, the resistance issome form of judgment. On the emotional level, it is some form of negativity.The intensity of the pain depends on the degree of resistance to the presentmoment, and this in turn depends on how strongly you are identified with yourmind. The mind always seeks to deny the Now and to escape from it. In otherwords, the more you are identified with your mind, the more you suffer. Or youmay put it like this: the more you are able to honor and accept the Now, themore you are free of pain, of suffering and free of the egoic mind.Why does the mind habitually deny or resist the Now? Because it cannot functionand remain in control without time, which is past and future, so it perceivesthe timeless Now as threatening. Time and mind are in fact inseparable.Imagine the Earth devoid of human life, inhabited only by plants and animals.Would it still have a past and a future? Could we still speak of time in anymeaningful way? The question “What time is it?” or “What's the date today?” ifanybody were there to ask it would be quite meaningless. The oak tree or theeagle would be bemused by such a question. “What time?” they would ask. “Well,of course, it's now. The time is now. What else is there?”Yes, we need the mind as well as time to function in this world, but there comesa point where they take over our lives, and this is where dysfunction, pain, andsorrow set in.The mind, to ensure that it remains in control, seeks continuously to cover upthe present moment with past and future, and so, as the vitality and infinitecreative potential of Being, which is inseparable from the Now, becomes coveredup by time, your true nature becomes obscured by the mind. An increasingly heavyburden of time has been accumulating in the human mind. All individuals aresuffering under this burden, but they also keep adding to it every momentwhenever they ignore or deny that precious moment or reduce it to a means ofgetting to some future moment, which only exists in the mind, never inactuality. The accumulation of time in the collective and individual human mindalso holds a vast amount of residual pain from the past.If you no longer want to create pain for yourself and others, if you no longerwant to add to the residue of past pain that still lives on in you, then dontcreate any more time, or at least no more than is necessary to deal with thepractical aspects of your life. How to stop creating time? Realize deeply thatthe present moment is all you ever have. Make the Now the primary focus of yourlife. Whereas before you dwelt in time and paid brief visits to the Now, haveyour dwelling place in the Now and pay brief visits to past and future whenrequired to deal with the practical aspects of your life situation. Always say“yes” to the present moment. What could be more futile, more insane, than tocreate inner resistance to something that already is? What could be more insanethan to oppose life itself, which is now and always now? Surrender to what is.Say “yes” to life and see how life suddenly starts working for you rather thanagainst you.¤The present moment is sometimes unacceptable, unpleasant, or awful.It is as it is. Observe how the mind labels it and how this labeling process,this continuous sitting in judgment, creates pain and unhappiness. By watchingthe mechanics of the mind, you step out of its resistance patterns, and you canthen allow the present moment to be. This will give you a taste of the state ofinner freedom from external conditions, the state of true inner peace. Then seewhat happens, and take action if necessary or possible.Accept then act. Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you hadchosen it. Always work with it, not against it. Make it your friend and ally,not your enemy. This will miraculously transform your whole life.¤"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWPAST PAIN: DISSOLVING THE PAIN-BODYAs long as you are unable to access the power of the Now, every emotional painthat you experience leaves behind a residue of pain that lives on in you. Itmerges with the pain from the past, which was already there, and becomes lodgedin your mind and body. This, of course, includes the pain you suffered as achild, caused by the unconsciousness of the world into which you were born.This accumulated pain is a negative energy field that occupies your body andmind. If you look on it as an invisible entity in its own right, you are gettingquite close to the truth. Its the emotional pain-body. It has two modes ofbeing: dormant and active. A pain-body may be dormant 90 percent of the time; ina deeply unhappy person, though, it may be active up to mo percent of the time.Some people live almost entirely through their pain-body, while others mayexperience it only in certain situations, such as intimate relationships, orsituations linked with past loss or abandonment, physical or emotional hurt, andso on. Anything can trigger it, particularly if it resonates with a pain patternfrom your past. When it is ready to awaken from its dormant stage, even athought or an innocent remark made by someone close to you can activate it.Some pain-bodies are obnoxious but relatively harmless, for example like a childwho won't stop whining. Others are vicious and destructive monsters, truedemons. Some are physically violent; many more are emotionally violent. Somewill attack people around you or close to you, while others may attack you,their host. Thoughts and feelings you have about your life then become deeplynegative and self- destructive. Illnesses and accidents are often created inthis way. Some pain-bodies drive their hosts to suicide. When you thought youknew a person and then you are suddenly confronted with this alien, nastycreature for the first time, you are in for quite a shock. However, it's moreimportant to observe it in yourself than in someone else. Watch out for any signof unhappiness in yourself, in whatever form it may be the awakening pain-body.This can take the form of irritation, impatience, a somber mood, a desire tohurt, anger, rage, depression, a need to have some drama in your relationship,and so on. Catch it the moment it awakens from its dormant state. The pain-bodywants to survive, just like every other entity in existence, and it can onlysurvive if it gets you to unconsciously identify with it. It can then rise up,take you over, “become you,” and live through you. It needs to get its “food”through you. It will feed on any experience that resonates with its own kind ofenergy, anything that creates further pain in whatever form: anger,destructiveness, hatred, grief, emotional drama, violence, and even illness. Sothe pain-body, when it has taken you over, will create a situation in your lifethat reflects back its own energy frequency for it to feed on. Pain can onlyfeed on pain. Pain cannot feed on joy. It finds it quite indigestible.Once the pain-body has taken you over, you want more pain. You become a victimor a perpetrator. You want to inflict pain, or you want to suffer pain, or both.There isn't really much difference between the two. You are not conscious ofthis, of course, and will vehemently claim that you do not want pain. But lookclosely and you will find that your thinking and behavior are designed to keepthe pain going, for yourself and others. If you were truly conscious of it, thepattern would dissolve, for to want more pain is insanity, and nobody isconsciously insane.The pain-body, which is the dark shadow cast by the ego, is actually afraid ofthe light of your consciousness. It is afraid of being found out. Its survivaldepends on your unconscious identification with it, as well as on yourunconscious fear of facing the pain that lives in you. But if you don't face it,if you don't bring the light of your consciousness into the pain, you will beforced to relive it again and again. The pain-body may seem to you like adangerous monster that you cannot bear to look at, but I assure you that it isan insubstantial phantom that cannot prevail against the power of your presence.Some spiritual teachings state that all pain is ultimately an illusion, and thisis true. The question is: Is it true for you? A mere belief doesn't make ittrue. Do you want to experience pain for the rest of your life and keep sayingthat it is an illusion? Does that free you from the pain? What we are concernedwith here is how you can realize this truth that is, make it real in your ownexperience.So the pain-body doesn't want you to observe it directly and see it for what itis. The moment you observe it, feel its energy field within you, and take yourattention into it, the identification is broken. A higher dimension ofconsciousness has come in. I call it presence. You are now the witness or thewatcher of the pain-body. This means that it cannot use you anymore bypretending to be you, and it can no longer replenish itself through you. Youhave found your own innermost strength. You have accessed the power of Now.What happens to the pain-body when we become conscious enough to break ouridentification with it?Unconsciousness creates it; consciousness transmutes it into itself. St. Paulexpressed this universal principle beautifully:. “Everything is shown up bybeing exposed to the light, and whatever is exposed to the light itself becomeslight.” Just as you cannot fight the darkness, you cannot fight the pain-body.Trying to do so would create inner conflict and thus further pain. Watching itis enough. Watching it implies accepting it as part of what is at that moment.The pain-body consists of trapped life-energy that has split off from your totalenergy field and has temporarily become autonomous through the unnatural processof mind identification. It has turned in on itself and become anti-life, like ananimal trying to devour its own tail. Why do you think our civilization hasbecome so life-destructive? But even the life-destructive forces are stilllife-energy.When you start to disidentify and become the watcher, the pain-body willcontinue to operate for a while and will try to trick you into identifying withit again. Although you are no longer energizing it through your identification,it has a certain momentum, just like a spinning wheel that will keep turning fora while even when it is no longer being propelled. At this stage, it may alsocreate physical aches and pains in different parts of the body, but they wontlast. Stay present, stay conscious. Be the ever-alert guardian of your innerspace. You need to be present enough to be able to watch the pain-body directlyand feel its energy. It then cannot control your thinking. The moment yourthinking is aligned with the energy field of the pain-body, you are identifiedwith it and again feeding it with your thoughts.For example, if anger is the predominant energy vibration of the pain-body andyou think angry thoughts, dwelling on what someone did to you or what you aregoing to do to him or her, then you have become unconscious, and the pain-bodyhas become “you.” Where there is anger, there is always pain underneath. Or whena dark mood comes upon you and you start getting into a negative mind-patternand thinking how dreadful your life is, your thinking has become aligned withthe pain-body, and you have become unconscious and vulnerable to the pain-body'sattack. “Unconscious,” the way that I use the word here, means to be identifiedwith some mental or emotional pattern. It implies a complete absence of thewatcher.Sustained conscious attention severs the link between the pain-body and yourthought processes and brings about the process of transmutation. It is as if thepain becomes fuel for the flame of your consciousness, which then burns morebrightly as a result. This is the esoteric meaning of the ancient art ofalchemy:, the transmutation of base metal into gold, of suffering intoconsciousness. The split within is healed, and you become whole again. Yourresponsibility then is not to create further pain.Let me summarize the process. Focus attention on the feeling inside you. Knowthat it is the pain-body. Accept that it is there. Don't think about it don'tlet the feeling turn into thinking. Don't judge or analyze. Don't make anidentity for yourself out of it. Stay present, and continue to be the observerof what is happening inside you. Become aware not only of the emotional pain butalso of “the one who observes,” the silent watcher. This is the power of theNow, the power of your own conscious presence. Then see what happens.¤For many women, the pain-body awakens particularly at the time preceding themenstrual flow. I will talk about this and the reason for it in more detaillater. Right now, let me just say this: If you are able to stay alert andpresent at that time and watch whatever you feel within, rather than be takenover by it, it affords an opportunity for the most powerful spiritual practice,and a rapid transmutation of all past pain becomes possible."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWEGO IDENTIFICATION WITH THE PAIN-BODYThe process that I have just described is profoundly powerful yet simple. Itcould be taught to a child, and hopefully one day it will be one of the firstthings children learn in school. Once you have understood the basic principle ofbeing present as the watcher of what happens inside you and you “understand” itby experiencing it you have at your disposal the most potent transformationaltool.This is not to deny that you may encounter intense inner resistance todisidentifying from your pain. This will be the case particularly if you havelived closely identified with your emotional pain-body for most of your life andthe whole or a large part of your sense of self is invested in it. What thismeans is that you have made an unhappy self out of your pain-body and believethat this mind-made fiction is who you are. In that case, unconscious fear oflosing your identity will create strong resistance to any disidentification. Inother words, you would rather be in pain be the pain-body than take a leap intothe unknown and risk losing the familiar unhappy self.If this applies to you, observe the resistance within yourself. Observe theattachment to your pain. Be very alert. Observe the peculiar pleasure you derivefrom being unhappy. Observe the compulsion to talk or think about it. Theresistance will cease if you make it conscious. You can then take your attentioninto the pain-body, stay present as the witness, and so initiate itstransmutation.Only you can do this. Nobody can do it for you. But if you are fortunate enoughto find someone who is intensely conscious, if you can be with them and jointhem in the state of presence, that can be helpful and will accelerate things.In this way, your own light will quickly grow stronger. When a log that has onlyjust started to burn is placed next to one that is burning fiercely, and after awhile they are separated again,the first log will be burning with much greater intensity. After all, it is thesame fire. To be such a fire is one of the functions of a spiritual teacher.Some therapists may also be able to fulfill that function, provided that theyhave gone beyond the level of mind and can create and sustain a state of intenseconscious presence while they are working with you."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWTHE ORIGIN OF FEARYou mentioned fear as being part of our basic underlying emotional pain. Howdoes fear arise, and why is there so much of it in people's lives? And isn't acertain amount of fear just healthy self protection?

You don't need fear to avoid unnecessary danger just a minimum ofintelligence and common sense. For such practical matters, it is useful to applythe lessons learned in the past. Now if someone threatened you with fire or withphysical violence, you might experience something like fear. This is aninstinctive shrinking back from danger, but not the psychological condition offear that we are talking about here.The psychological condition of fear is divorced from any concrete and trueimmediate danger. It comes in many forms: unease, worry, anxiety, nervousness,tension, dread, phobia, and so on. This kind of psychological fear is always ofsomething that might happen, not of something that is happening now. You are inthe here and now, while your mind is in the future. This creates an anxiety gap.And if you are identified with your mind and have lost touch with the power andsimplicity of the Now, that anxiety gap will be your constant companion. You canalways cope with the present moment, but you cannot cope with something that isonly a mind projection you cannot cope with the future.Moreover, as long as you are identified with your mind, the ego runs your life,as I pointed out earlier. Because of its phantom nature, and despite elaboratedefense mechanisms, the ego is very vulnerable and insecure, and it sees itselfas constantly under threat. This, by the way, is the case even if the ego isoutwardly very confident. Now remember that an emotion is the body's reaction toyour mind. What message is the body receiving continuously from the ego, thefalse, mind-made self? Danger, I am under threat. And what is the emotiongenerated by this continuous message? Fear, of course.Fear seems to have many causes. Fear of loss, fear of failure, fear of beinghurt, and so on, but ultimately all fear is the ego's fear of death, ofannihilation. To the ego, death is always just around the corner. In thismind-identified state, fear of death affects every aspect of your life. Forexample, even such a seemingly trivial and “normal” thing as the compulsive needto be right in an argument and make the other person wrong defending the mentalposition with which you have identified is due to the fear of death. If youidentify with a mental position, then if you are wrong, your mind-based sense ofself is seriously threatened with annihilation. So you as the ego cannot affordto be wrong. To be wrong is to die. Wars have been fought over this, andcountless relationships have broken down.Once you have disidentified from your mind, whether you are right or wrong makesno difference to your sense of self at all, so the forcefully compulsive anddeeply unconscious need to be right, which is a form of violence, will no longerbe there. You can state dearly and firmly how you feel or what you think, butthere will be no aggressiveness or defensiveness about it. Your sense of self isthen derived from a deeper and truer place within yourself, not from the mind.Watch out for any kind of defensiveness within yourself. What are you defending?An illusory identity, an image in your mind, a fictitious entity. By making thispattern conscious, by witnessing it, you disidentify from it. In the light ofyour consciousness, the unconscious pattern will then quickly dissolve. This isthe end of all arguments and power games, which are so corrosive torelationships. Power over others is weakness disguised as strength. True poweris within, and it is available to you now.So anyone who is identified with their mind and, therefore, disconnected fromtheir true power, their deeper self rooted in Being, will have fear as theirconstant companion. The number of people who have gone beyond mind is as yetextremely small, so you can assume that virtually everyone you meet or knowlives in a state of fear. Only the intensity of it varies. It fluctuates betweenanxiety and dread at one end of the scale and a vague unease and distant senseof threat at the other. Most people become conscious of it only when it takes onone of its more acute forms."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWTHE EGO'S SEARCH FOR WHOLENESSAnother aspect of the emotional pain that is an intrinsic part of the egoic mindis a deep-seated sense of lack or incompleteness, of not being whole. In somepeople, this is conscious, in others unconscious. If it is conscious, itmanifests as the unsettling and constant feeling of not being worthy or goodenough. If it is unconscious, it will only be felt indirectly as an intensecraving, wanting and needing. In either case, people will often enter into acompulsive pursuit of ego-gratification and things to identify with in order tofill this hole they feel within. So they strive after possessions, money,success, power, recognition, or a special relationship, basically so that theycan feel better about themselves, feel more complete. But even when they attainall these things, they soon find that the hole is still there, that it isbottomless. Then they are really in trouble, because they cannot deludethemselves anymore. Well, they can and do, but it gets more difficult.As long as the egoic mind is running your life, you cannot truly be at ease; youcannot be at peace or fulfilled except for brief intervals when you obtainedwhat you wanted, when a craving has just been fulfilled. Since the ego is aderived sense of self, it needs to identify with external things. It needs to beboth defended and fed constantly. The most common ego identifications have to dowith possessions, the work you do, social status and recognition, knowledge andeducation, physical appearance, special abilities, relationships, personal andfamily history, belief systems, and often also political, nationalistic, racial,religious, and other collective identifications. None of these is you. Do youfind this frightening? Or is it a relief to know this? All of these things youwill have to relinquish sooner or later. Perhaps you find it as yet hard tobelieve, and I am certainly not asking you to believe that your identity cannotbe found in any of those things. You will know the troth of it for yourself. Youwill know it at the latest when you feel death approaching. Death is a strippingaway of all that is not you. The secret of life is to “die before you die” andfind that there is no death."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOW"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWMOVING DEEPLY INTO THE NOW"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWDON'T SEEK YOUR SELF IN THE MINDI feel that there is still ct great deal I need to learn about the workings ofmy mind before I can get anywhere near full consciousness or spiritualenlightenment.No, you don't. The problems of the mind cannot be solved on the level of themind. Once you have understood the basic dysfunction, there isnt really muchelse that you need to learn or understand. Studying the complexities of the mindmay make you a good psychologist, but doing so won't take you beyond the mind,just as the study of madness isn't enough to create sanity. You have alreadyunderstood the basic mechanics of the unconscious state: identification with themind, which creates a false self, the ego, as a substitute for your true selfrooted in Being. You become as a “branch cut off from the vine,” as Jesus putsit.The ego's needs are endless. It feels vulnerable and threatened and so lives ina state of fear and want. Once you know how the basic dysfunction operates,there is no need to explore all its countless manifestations, no need to make itinto a complex personal problem. The ego, of course, loves that. It is alwaysseeking for something to attach itself to in order to uphold and strengthen itsillusory sense of self, and it will readily attach itself to your problems. Thisis why, for so many people, a large part of their sense of self is intimatelyconnected with their problems. Once this has happened, the last thing they wantis to become free of them; that would mean loss of self. There can be a greatdeal of unconscious ego investment in pain and suffering.So once you recognize the root of unconsciousness as identification with themind, which of course includes the emotions, you step out of it. You becomepresent. When you are present, you can allow the mind to be as it is withoutgetting entangled in it. The mind in itself is not dysfunctional.It is a wonderful tool. Dysfunction sets in when you seek your self in it andmistake it for who you are. It then becomes the egoic mind and takes over yourwhole life."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWEND THE DELUSION OF TIMEIt seems almost impossible to disidentify from the mind. We are all immersed init. How do you teach a fish to fly?Here is the key: End the delusion of time. Time and mind are inseparable. Removetime from the mind and it stops unless you choose to use it.To be identified with your mind is to be trapped in time: the compulsion to livealmost exclusively through memory and anticipation. This creates an endlesspreoccupation with past and future and an unwillingness to honor and acknowledgethe present moment and allow it to be. The compulsion arises because the pastgives you an identity and the future holds the promise of salvation, offulfillment in whatever form. Both are illusions.But without a sense of time, how would we function in this world? There would beno goals to strive toward anymore. I wouldn't even know who I am, because mypast makes me who I am today. I think time is something very precious, and weneed to learn to use it wisely rather than waste it. Time isn't precious at all,because it is an illusion. What you perceive as precious is not time but the onepoint that is out of time: the Now. That is precious indeed. The more you arefocused on time past and future the more you miss the Now, the most preciousthing there is.Why is it the most precious thing? Firstly, because it is the only thing. Itsall there is. The eternal present is the space within which your whole lifeunfolds, the one factor that remains constant. Life is now. There was never atime when your life was not now, nor will there ever be. Secondly,the Now is the only point that can take you beyond the limited confines of themind. It is your only point of access into the timeless and formless realm ofBeing.¤"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWNOTHING EXISTS OUTSIDE THE NOWAren't past and future just as real, sometimes even more real, than the present?After all, the past determines who we are, as well as how we perceive and behavein the present. And our future goals determine which actions we take in thepresent.You havent yet grasped the essence of what I am saying because you are trying tounderstand it mentally. The mind cannot understand this. Only you can. Pleasejust listen.Have you ever experienced, done, thought, or felt anything outside the Now? Doyou think you ever will? Is it possible for anything to happen or be outside theNow? The answer is obvious, is it not? Nothing ever happened in the past; ithappened in the Now.Nothing will ever happen in the future; it will happen in the Now.What you think of as the past is a memory trace, stored in the mind, of a formerNow. When you remember the past, you reactivate a memory trace and you do sonow. The future is an imagined Now, a projection of the mind. When the futurecomes, it comes as the Now. When you think about the future, you do it now. Pastand future obviously have no reality of their own. Just as the moon has no lightof its own, but can only reflect the light of the sun, so are past and futureonly pale reflections of the light, power, and reality of the eternal present.Their reality is “borrowed” from the Now.The essence of what I am saying here cannot be understood by the mind. Themoment you grasp it, there is a shift in consciousness from mind to Being, fromtime to presence. Suddenly, everything feels alive, radiates energy, emanatesBeing.¤"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWTHE KEY TO THE SPIRITUAL DIMENSIONIn life-threatening emergency situations, the shift in consciousness from timeto presence sometimes happens naturally. The personality that has a past and afuture momentarily recedes and is replaced by an intense conscious presence,very still but very alert at the same time. Whatever response is needed thenarises out of that state of consciousness. The reason why some people love toengage in dangerous activities, such as mountain climbing, car racing, and soon, although they may not be aware of it, is that it forces them into the Nowthat intensely alive state that is free of time, free of problems, free ofthinking, free of the burden of the personality. Slipping away from the presentmoment even for a second may mean death. Unfortunately, they come to depend on aparticular activity to be in that state. But you don't need to climb the northface of the Eiger. You can enter that state now.¤Since ancient times, spiritual masters of all traditions have pointed to the Nowas the key to the spiritual dimension. Despite this, it seems to have remained asecret. It is certainly not taught in churches and temples. If you go to achurch, you may hear readings from the Gospels such as “Take no thought for themorrow; for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself,” or “Nobodywho puts his hands to the plow and looks back is fit for the Kingdom of God.” Oryou might hear the passage about the beautiful flowers that are not anxiousabout tomorrow but live with ease in the timeless Now and are provided forabundantly by God. The depth and radical nature of these teachings are notrecognized. No one seems to realize that they are meant to be lived and so bringabout a profound inner transformation.¤ The whole essence of Zen consists in walking along the razor's edge of Now tobe so utterly, so completely present that no problem, no suffering, nothing thatis not who you are in your essence, can survive in you. In the Now, in theabsence of time, all your problems dissolve. Suffering needs time; it cannotsurvive in the Now.The great Zen master Rinzai, in order to take his students' attention away fromtime, would often raise his finger and slowly ask: “What, at this moment, islacking?” A powerful question that does not require an answer on the level ofthe mind. It is designed to take your attention deeply into the Now. A similarquestion in the Zen tradition is this: “If not now, when?”¤The Now is also central to the teaching of Sufism, the mystical branch of Islam.Sufis have a saying: “The Sufi is the son of time present.” And Rumi, the greatpoet and teacher of Sufism, declares: “Past and future veil God from our sight;burn up both of them with fire.”Meister Eckhart, the thirteenth-century spiritual teacher, summed it all upbeautifully “Time is what keeps the light from reaching us. There is no greaterobstacle to God than time.”¤"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWACCESSING THE POWER OF THE NOWA moment ago, when you talked about the eternal present and the unreality ofpast and future, I found myself looking at that tree outside the window. I hadlooked at it a few times before, but this time it was different. The externalperception had not changed much, except that the colors seemed brighter and morevibrant. But there was now an added dimension to it. This is hard to explain. Idon't know how, but I was aware of something invisible that I felt was theessence of that tree, its inner spirit, if you like. And somehow I was part ofthat. I realize now that I hadn't truly seen the tree before, just a flat anddead image of it. When I look at the tree now, some of that awareness is stillpresent, but I can feel it slipping away. You see, the experience is alreadyreceding into the past. Can something like this ever be more than affectingglimpse?You were free of time for a moment. You moved into the Now and thereforeperceived the tree without the screen of mind. The awareness of Being becamepart of your perception. With the timeless dimension comes a different kind ofknowing, one that does not “kill” the spirit that lives within every creatureand every thing. A knowing that does not destroy the sacredness and mystery oflife but contains a deep love and reverence for all that is. A knowing of whichthe mind knows nothing.The mind cannot know the tree. It can only know facts or information about thetree. My mind cannot know you, only labels, judgments, facts, and opinions aboutyou. Being alone knows directly.There is a place for mind and mind knowledge. It is in the practical realm ofday-to-day living. However, when it takes over all aspects of your life,including your relationships with other human beings and with nature, it becomesa monstrous parasite that, unchecked, may well end up killing all life on theplanet and finally itself by killing its host.You have had a glimpse of how the timeless can transform your perceptions. Butan experience is not enough, no matter how beautiful or profound. What is neededand what we are concerned with is a permanent shift in consciousness.So break the old pattern of present-moment denial and present-moment resistance.Make it your practice to withdraw attention from past and future whenever theyare not needed. Step out of the time dimension as much as possible in everydaylife. If you find it hard to enter the Now directly, start by observing thehabitual tendency of your mind to want to escape from the Now. You will observethat the future is usually imagined as either better or worse than the present.If the imagined future is better, it gives you hope or pleasurable anticipation.If it is worse, it creates anxiety. Both are illusory. Through self-observation,more presence comes into your life automatically. The moment you realize you arenot present, you are present. Whenever you are able to observe your mind, youare no longer trapped in it. Another factor has come in, something that is notof the mind:the witnessing presence. Be present as the watcher of your mind of your thoughtsand emotions as well as your reactions in various situations. Be at least asinterested in your reactions as in the situation or person that causes you toreact. Notice also how often your attention is in the past or future. Don'tjudge or analyze what you observe. Watch the thought, feel the emotion, observethe reaction. Dont make a personal problem out of them. You will then feelsomething more powerful than any of those things that you observe: the still,observing presence itself behind the content of your mind, the silent watcher. ¤Intense presence is needed when certain situations trigger a reaction with astrong emotional charge, such as when your self-image is threatened, a challengecomes into your life that triggers fear, things “go wrong,” or an emotionalcomplex from the past is brought up. In those instances, the tendency is for youto become “unconscious.” The reaction or emotion takes you over you “become” it.You act it out. You justify, make wrong, attack, defend . . . except that itisn't you, it's the reactive pattern, the mind in its habitual survival mode.Identification with the mind gives it more energy;, observation of the mindwithdraws energy from it. Identification with the mind creates more time;observation of the mind opens up the dimension of the timeless. The energy thatis withdrawn from the mind turns into presence. Once you can feel what it meansto be present, it becomes much easier to simply choose to step out of the timedimension whenever time is not needed for practical purposes and move moredeeply into the Now. This does not impair your ability to use time past orfuture when you need to refer to it for practical matters. Nor does it impairyour ability to use your mind. In fact, it enhances it. When you do use yourmind, it will be sharper, more focused."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWLETTING GO OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TIMELearn to use time in the practical aspects of your life we may call this “clocktime” but immediately return to present-moment awareness when those practicalmatters have been dealt with. In this way, there will be no build-up of“psychological time,” which is identification with the past and continuouscompulsive projection into the future.Clock time is not just making an appointment or planning a trip. It includeslearning from the past so that we don't repeat the same mistakes over and over.Setting goals and working toward them. Predicting the future by means ofpatterns and laws, physical, mathematical and so on, learned from the past andtaking appropriate action on the basis of our predictions.But even here, within the sphere of practical living, where we cannot do withoutreference to past and future, the present moment remains the essential factor,Any lesson from the past becomes relevant and is applied now. Any planning aswell as working toward achieving a particular goal is done now.The enlightened person's main focus of attention is always the Now, but they arestill peripherally aware of time. In other words, they continue to use clocktime but are free of psychological time.Be alert as you practice this so that you do not unwittingly transform clocktime into psychological time. For example, if you made a mistake in the past andlearn from it now, you are using clock time. On the other hand, if you dwell onit mentally, and self-criticism, remorse, or guilt come up, then you are makingthe mistake into “me” and “mine”: you make it part of your sense of self, and ithas become psychological time, which is always linked to a false sense ofidentity. Nonforgiveness necessarily implies a heavy burden of psychologicaltime.If you set yourself a goal and work toward it, you are using clock time. You areaware of where you want to go, but you honor and give your fullest attention tothe step that you are taking at this moment. If you then become excessivelyfocused on the goal, perhaps because you are seeking happiness, fulfillment, ora more complete sense of self in it, the Now is no longer honored. It becomesreduced to a mere stepping stone to the future, with no intrinsic value. Clocktime then turns into psychological time. Your life's journey is no longer anadventure, just an obsessive need to arrive, to attain, to “make it.” You nolonger see or smell the flowers by the wayside either, nor are you aware of thebeauty and the miracle of life that unfolds all around you when you are presentin the Now.¤I can see the supreme importance of the Now, but I cannot quite go along withyou when you say that time is a complete illusion.When I say “time is an illusion,” my intention is not to make a philosophicalstatement. I am just reminding you of a simple fact a fact so obvious that youmay find it hard to grasp and may even find it meaningless but once fullyrealized, it can cut like a sword through all the mind-created layers ofcomplexity and “problems.” Let me say it again: the present moment is all youever have. There is never a time when your life is not “this moment.” Is thisnot a fact?"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWTHE INSANITY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TIMEYou will not have any doubt that psychological time is a mental disease if youlook at its collective manifestations. They occur, for example, in the form ofideologies such as communism, national socialism or any nationalism, or rigidreligious belief systems, which operate under the implicit assumption that thehighest good lies in the future and that therefore the end justifies the means.The end is an idea, a point in the mind-projected future, when salvation inwhatever form happiness, fulfillment, equality, liberation, and so on will beattained. Not infrequently, the means of getting there are the enslavement,torture, and murder of people in the present.For example, it is estimated that as many as 50 million people were murdered tofurther the cause of communism, to bring about a “better world” in Russia,China, and other countries. This is a chilling example of how belief in a futureheaven creates a present hell.

Are youalways focused on becoming,achieving, and attaining, or alternatively chasing some new thrill or pleasure?Do you believe that if you acquire more things you will become more fulfilled,good enough, or psychologically complete? Are you waiting for a man or woman togive meaning to your life?In the normal, mind-identified or unenlightened state of consciousness, thepower and infinite creative potential that lie concealed in the Now arecompletely obscured by psychological time. Your life then loses its vibrancy,its freshness, its sense of wonder. The old patterns of thought, emotion,behavior, reaction, and desire are acted out in endless repeat performances, ascript in your mind that gives you an identity of sorts but distorts or coversup the reality of the Now.

Superficial changes are possible,but real transformation is rare and depends upon whether you can become presentenough to dissolve the past by accessing the power of the Now. What you perceiveas future is an intrinsic part of your state of consciousness now. If your mindcarries a heavy burden of past, you will experience more of the same. The pastperpetuates itself through lack of presence. The quality of your consciousnessat this moment is what shapes the future which, of course, can only beexperienced as the Now.You may win $10 million, but that kind of change is no more than skin deep.

You believe that they are caused by specific situations in yourlife, and seen from a conventional viewpoint, this is true. But until you havedealt with the basic problem-making dysfunction of the mind its attachment topast and future and denial of the Now problems are actually interchangeable. Ifall your problems or perceived causes of suffering or unhappiness weremiraculously removed for you today, but you had not become more present, moreconscious, you would soon find yourself with a similar set of problems or causesof suffering, like a shadow that follows you wherever you go.

I mean, is this changeinevitable?Thats a question of perspective. The doing and the happening is in fact a singleprocess; because you are one with the totality of consciousness, you cannotseparate the two. But there is no absolute guarantee that humans will make it.The process isn't inevitable or automatic. Your cooperation is an essential partof it. However you look at it, it is a quantum leap in the evolution ofconsciousness, as well as our only chance of survival as a race."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWTHE JOY OF BEINGTo alert you that you have allowed yourself to be taken over by psychologicaltime, you can use a simple criterion. Ask yourself: Is there joy, ease, andlightness in what I am doing? If there isn't, then time is covering up thepresent moment, and life is perceived as a burden or a struggle.If there is no joy, ease, or lightness in what you are doing, it does notnecessarily mean that you need to change what you are doing. It may besufficient to change the how. “How” is always more important than “what.” See ifyou can give much more attention to the doing than to the result that you wantto achieve through it. Give your fullest attention to whatever the momentpresents. This implies that you also completely accept what is, because youcannot give your full attention to something and at the same time resist it.As soon as you honor the present moment, all unhappiness and struggle dissolve,and life begins to flow with joy and ease. When you act out of present-momentawareness, whatever you do becomes imbued with a sense of quality, care, andlove even the most simple action.¤So do not be concerned with the fruit of your action just give attention to theaction itself. The fruit will come of its own accord. This is a powerfulspiritual practice. In the Bhagavad Gita, one of the oldest and most beautifulspiritual teachings in existence, non-attachment to the fruit of your action iscalled Karma Yoga. It is described as the path of “consecrated action.”When the compulsive striving away from the Now ceases, the joy of Being flowsinto everything you do. The moment your attention turns to the Now, you feel apresence, a stillness, a peace. You no longer depend on the future forfulfillment and satisfaction you don't look to it for salvation. Therefore, youare not attached to the results. Neither failure nor success has the power tochange your inner state of Being. You have found the life underneath your lifesituation.In the absence of psychological time, your sense of self is derived from Being,not from your personal past. Therefore, the psychological need to becomeanything other than who you are already is no longer there. In the world, on thelevel of your life situation, you may indeed become wealthy, knowledgeable,successful, free of this or that, but in the deeper dimension of Being you arecomplete and whole now.In that state of wholeness, would we still be able or willing to pursue externalgoals ?Of course, but you will not have illusory expectations that anything or anybodyin the future will save you or make you happy. As far as your life situation isconcerned, there may be things to be attained or acquired. Thats the world ofform,of gain and loss. Yet on a deeper level you are already complete, and when yourealize that, there is a playful, joyous energy behind what you do. Being freeof psychological time, you no longer pursue your goals with grim determination,driven by fear, anger, discontent, or the need to become someone. Nor will youremain inactive through fear of failure, which to the ego is loss of self. Whenyour deeper sense of self is derived from Being, when you are free of “becoming”as a psychological need, neither your happiness nor your sense of self dependson the outcome, and so there is freedom from fear. You don't seek permanencywhere it cannot be found: in the world of form, of gain and loss, birth anddeath. You don't demand that situations, conditions, places, or people shouldmake you happy, and then suffer when they don't live up to your expectations.Everything is honored, but nothing matters. Forms are born and die, yet you areaware of the eternal underneath the forms. You know that “nothing real can bethreatened.”When this is your state of Being, how can you not succeed? You have succeededalready."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOW"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWMIND STRATEGIES FOR AVOIDING THE NOW"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWLOSS OF NOW: THE CORE DELUSIONEven if I completely accept that ultimately time is an illusion, what differenceis that going to make in my life? I still have to live in a world that iscompletely dominated by time.Intellectual agreement is just another belief and won't make much difference toyour life. To realize this truth, you need to live it. When every cell of yourbody is so present that it feels vibrant with life, and when you can feel thatlife every moment as the joy of Being, then it can be said that you are free oftime.But I still have to pay the bills tomorrow, and I am still going to grow old anddie just like everybody else. So how can I ever say that I am free of time?Tomorrow's bills are not the problem. The dissolution of the physical body isnot a problem. Loss of Now is the problem, or rather: the core delusion thatturns a mere situation, event, or emotion into a personal problem and intosuffering. Loss of Now is loss of Being.To be free of time is to be free of the psychological need of past for youridentity and future for your fulfillment. It represents the most profoundtransformation of consciousness that you can imagine. In some rare cases, thisshift in consciousness happens dramatically and radically, once and for all.When it does, it usually comes about through total surrender in the midst ofintense suffering. Most people, however, have to work at it.When you have had your first few glimpses of the timeless state ofconsciousness, you begin to move back and forth between the dimensions of timeand presence. First you become aware of just how rarely your attention is trulyin the Now. But to know that you are not present is a great success: thatknowing is presence even if initially it only lasts for a couple of seconds ofdock time before it is lost again. Then, with increasing frequency, you chooseto have the focus of your consciousness in the present moment rather than in thepast or future, and whenever you realize that you had lost the Now, you are ableto stay in it not just for a couple of seconds, but for longer periods asperceived from the external perspective of dock time. So before you are firmlyestablished in the state of presence, which is to say before you are fullyconscious, you shift back and forth for a while between consciousness andunconsciousness, between the state of presence and the state of mindidentification. You lose the Now, and you return to it, again and again.Eventually, presence becomes your predominant state.For most people, presence is experienced either never at all or onlyaccidentally and briefly on rare occasions without being recognized for what itis. Most humans alternate not between consciousness and unconsciousness but onlybetween different levels of unconsciousness."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWORDINARY UNCONSCIOUSNESS AND DEEP UNCONSCIOUSNESSWhat do you mean by different levels of unconsciousness? As you probably know,in sleep you constantly move between the phases of dreamless sleep and the dreamstate. Similarly, in wakefulness most people only shift between ordinaryunconsciousness and deep unconsciousness. What I call ordinary unconsciousnessmeans being identified with your thought processes and emotions, your reactions,desires, and aversions. It is most people's normal state. In that state, you arerun by the egoic mind, and you are unaware of Being.It is a state not of acute pain or unhappiness but of an almost continuous lowlevel of unease, discontent, boredom, or nervousness a kind of backgroundstatic. You may not realize this because it is so much a part of “normal”living, just as you are not aware of a continuous low background noise, such asthe hum of an air conditioner, until it stops. When it suddenly does stop, thereis a sense of relief. Many people use alcohol, drugs, sex, food, work,television, or even shopping as anesthetics in an unconscious attempt to removethe basic unease. When this happens, an activity that might be very enjoyable ifused in moderation becomes imbued with a compulsive or addictive quality, andall that is ever achieved through it is extremely short-lived symptom relief.The unease of ordinary unconsciousness turns into the pain of deepunconsciousness a state of more acute and more obvious suffering or unhappinesswhen things “go wrong,” when the ego is threatened or there is a majorchallenge, threat, or loss, real or imagined, in your life situation or conflictin a relationship. It is an intensified version of ordinary unconsciousness,different from it not in kind but in degree.In ordinary unconsciousness, habitual resistance to or denial of what is createsthe unease and discontent that most people accept as normal living. When thisresistance becomes intensified through some challenge or threat to the ego, itbrings up intense negativity such as anger, acute fear, aggression, depression,and so on. Deep unconsciousness often means that the pain-body has beentriggered and that you have become identified with it. Physical violence wouldbe impossible without deep unconsciousness. It can also occur easily wheneverand wherever a crowd of people or even an entire nation generates a negativecollective energy field.The best indicator of your level of consciousness is how you deal with life'schallenges when they come. Through those challenges, an already unconsciousperson tends to become more deeply unconscious, and a conscious person moreintensely conscious. You can use a challenge to awaken you, or you can allow itto pull you into even deeper sleep. The dream of ordinary unconsciousness thenturns into a nightmare.If you cannot be present even in normal circumstances, such as when you aresitting alone in a room, walking in the woods, or listening to someone, then youcertainly won't be able to stay conscious when something “goes wrong” or you arefaced with difficult people or situations, with loss or the threat of loss. Youwill be taken over by a reaction, which ultimately is always some form of fear,and pulled into deep unconsciousness. Those challenges are your tests. Only theway in which you deal with them will show you and others where you are at as faras your state of consciousness is concerned, not how long you can sit with youreyes closed or what visions you see.So it is essential to bring more consciousness into your life in ordinarysituations when everything is going relatively smoothly. In this way, you growin presence power. It generates an energy field in you and around you of a highvibrational frequency. No unconsciousness, no negativity, no discord or violencecan enter that field and survive, just as darkness cannot survive in thepresence of light.When you learn to be the witness of your thoughts and emotions, which is anessential part of being present, you may be surprised when you first becomeaware of the background “static” of ordinary unconsciousness and realize howrarely, if ever, you are truly at ease within yourself. On the level of yourthinking, you will find a great deal of resistance in the form of judgment,discontent, and mental projection away from the Now. On the emotional level,there will be an undercurrent of unease, tension, boredom, or nervousness. Bothare aspects of the mind in its habitual resistance mode."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWWHAT ARE THEY SEEKING?Carl Jung tells in one of his books of a conversation he had with a NativeAmerican chief who pointed out to him that in his perception most white peoplehave tense faces, staring eyes, and a cruel demeanor. He said: “They are alwaysseeking something. What are they seeking? The whites always want something. Theyare always uneasy and restless. We dont know what they want. We think they aremad.”The undercurrent of constant unease started long before the rise of Westernindustrial civilization, of course, but in Western civilization, which nowcovers almost the entire globe, including most of the East, it manifests in anunprecedentedly acute form. It was already there at the time of Jesus, and itwas there 60o years before that at the time of Buddha, and long before that. Whyare you always anxious? Jesus asked his disciples. “Can anxious thought add asingle day to your life?” And the Buddha taught that the root of suffering is tobe found in our constant wanting and craving.Resistance to the Now as a collective dysfunction is intrinsically connected toloss of awareness of Being and forms the basis of our dehumanized industrialcivilization. Freud, by the way, also recognized the existence of thisundercurrent of unease and wrote about it in his book Civilization and ItsDiscontents, but he did not recognize the true root of the unease and failed torealize that freedom from it is possible. This collective dysfunction hascreated a very unhappy and extraordinarily violent civilization that has becomea threat not only to itself but also to all life on the planet."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWDISSOLVING ORDINARY UNCONSCIOUSNESSSo how can we be free of this affliction?Make it conscious. Observe the many ways in which unease, discontent, andtension arise within you through unnecessary judgment, resistance to what is,and denial of the Now. Anything unconscious dissolves when you shine the lightof consciousness on it. Once you know how to dissolve ordinary unconsciousness,the light of your presence will shine brightly, and it will be much easier todeal with deep unconsciousness whenever you feel its gravitational pull.However, ordinary unconsciousness may not be easy to detect initially because itis so normal.Make it a habit to monitor your mental-emotional state through self-observation.'Am I at ease at this moment?“ is a good question to ask yourself frequently. Oryou can ask: ”Whats going on inside me at this moment?\" Be at least asinterested in what goes on inside you as what happens outside. If you get theinside right, the outside will fall into place. Primary reality is within,secondary reality without. But dont answer these questions immediately. Directyour attention inward. Have a look inside yourself. What kind of thoughts isyour mind producing? What do you feel? Direct your attention into the body. Isthere any tension? Once you detect that there is a low level of unease, thebackground static, see in what way you are avoiding, resisting, or denying lifeby denying the Now. There are many ways in which people unconsciously resist thepresent moment. I will give you a few examples. With practice, your power ofself- observation, of monitoring your inner state, will become sharpened."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWFREEDOM FROM UNHAPPINESSDo you resent doing what you are doing? It may be your job, or you may haveagreed to do something and are doing it, but part of you resents and resists it.Are you carrying unspoken resentment toward a person close to you? Do yourealize that the energy you thus emanate is so harmful in its effects that youare in fact contaminating yourself as well as those around you? Have a good lookinside. Is there even the slightest trace of resentment, unwillingness? If thereis, observe it on both the mental and the emotional levels. What thoughts isyour mind creating around this situation? Then look at the emotion, which is thebody's reaction to those thoughts. Feel the emotion. Does it feel pleasant orunpleasant? Is it an energy that you would actually choose to have inside you?Do you have a choice?Maybe you are being taken advantage of, maybe the activity you are engaged in istedious, maybe someone close to you is dishonest, irritating, or unconscious,but all this is irrelevant. Whether your thoughts and emotions about thissituation are justified or not makes no difference. The fact is that you areresisting what is. You are making the present moment into an enemy. You arecreating unhappiness, conflict between the inner and the outer. Your unhappinessis polluting not only your own inner being and those around you but also thecollective human psyche of which you are an inseparable part. The pollution ofthe planet is only an outward reflection of an inner psychic pollution: millionsof unconscious individuals not taking responsibility for their inner space.Either stop doing what you are doing, speak to the person concerned and expressfully what you feel, or drop the negativity that your mind has created aroundthe situation and that serves no purpose whatsoever except to strengthen a falsesense of self. Recognizing its futility is important. Negativity is never theoptimum way of dealing with any situation. In fact, in most cases it keeps youstuck in it, blocking real change. Anything that is done with negative energywill become contaminated by it and in time give rise to more pain, moreunhappiness. Furthermore, any negative inner state is contagious: Unhappinessspreads more easily than a physical disease. Through the law of resonance, ittriggers and feeds latent negativity in others, unless they are immune that is,highly conscious.Are you polluting the world or cleaning up the mess? You are responsible foryour inner space; nobody else is, just as you are responsible for the planet. Aswithin, so without: If humans clear inner pollution, then they will also ceaseto create outer pollution.How can we drop negativity, as you suggest?By dropping it. How do you drop a piece of hot coal that you are holding in yourhand? How do you drop some heavy and useless baggage that you are carrying? Byrecognizing that you don't want to suffer the pain or carry the burden anymoreand then letting go of it.Deep unconsciousness, such as the pain-body, or other deep pain, such as theloss of a loved one, usually needs to be transmuted through acceptance combinedwith the light of your presence your sustained attention. Many patterns inordinary unconsciousness, on the other hand, can simply be dropped once you knowthat you don't want them and don't need them anymore, once you realize that youhave a choice, that you are not just a bundle of conditioned reflexes. All thisimplies that you are able to access the power of Now. Without it, you have nochoice. If you call some emotions negative, aren't you creating a mentalpolarity of good and bad, as you explained earlier?No. The polarity was created at an earlier stage when your mind judged thepresent moment as bad; this judgment then created the negative emotion.But if you call some emotions negative, aren't you really saying that theyshouldn't be there, that it's not okay to have those emotions? My understandingis that we should give ourselves permission to have whatever feelings come up,rather than judge them as bad or say that we shouldn't have them. It's okay tofeel resentful; it's okay to be angry, irritated, moody, or whatever otherwise,we get into repression, inner conflict, or denial. Everything is okay as it is.Of course. Once a mind pattern, an emotion or a reaction is there, accept it.You were not conscious enough to have a choice in the matter. Thats not ajudgment, just a fact. If you had a choice, or realized that you do have achoice, would you choose suffering or joy, ease or unease, peace or conflict?Would you choose a thought or feeling that cuts you off from your natural stateof well-being, the joy of life within? Any such feeling I call negative, whichsimply means bad. Not in the sense that “You shouldn't have done that” but justplain factual bad, like feeling sick in the stomach.How is it possible that humans killed in excess of 100 million fellow humans inthe twentieth century alone? Humans inflicting pain of such magnitude on oneanother is beyond anything you can imagine. And thats not taking into accountthe mental, emotional and physical violence, the torture, pain, and cruelty theycontinue to inflict on each other as well as on other sentient beings on a dailybasis.Do they act in this way because they are in touch with 87 their natural state,the joy of life within? Of course not. Only people who are in a deeply negativestate, who feel very bad indeed, would create such a reality as a reflection ofhow they feel. Now they are engaged in destroying nature and the planet thatsustains them. Unbelievable but true. Humans are a dangerously insane and verysick species. Thats not a judgment. Ifs a fact. It is also a fact that thesanity is there underneath the madness. Healing and redemption are availableright now.Coming back specifically to what you said it is certainly true that, when youaccept your resentment, moodiness, anger, and so on, you are no longer forced toact them out blindly, and you are less likely to project them onto others. But Iwonder if you are not deceiving yourself. When you have been practicingacceptance for a while, as you have,there comes a point when you need to go on to the next stage, where thosenegative emotions are not created anymore. If you don't, your “acceptance” justbecomes a mental label that allows your ego to continue to indulge inunhappiness and so strengthen its sense of separation from other people, yoursurroundings, youre here and now. As you know, separation is the basis for theego's sense of identity. True acceptance would transmute those feelings at once.And if you really knew deeply that everything is “okay,” as you put it, andwhich of course is true, then would you have those negative feelings in thefirst place? Without judgment, without resistance to what is, they would notarise. You have an idea in your mind that “everything is okay,” but deep downyou dont really believe it, and so the old mental- emotional patterns ofresistance are still in place. Thats what makes you feel bad.Thats okay, too.Are you defending your right to be unconscious, your right to suffer? Don'tworry: nobody is going to take that away from you. Once you realize that acertain kind of food makes you sick, would you carry on eating that food andkeep asserting that it is okay to be sick?"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWWHEREVER YOU ARE, BE THERE TOTALLYCan you give some more examples of ordinary unconsciousness?See if you can catch yourself complaining, in either speech or thought, about asituation you find yourself in, what other people do or say, your surroundings,your life situation, even the weather. To complain is always nonacceptance ofwhat is.It invariably carries an unconscious negative charge. When you complain, youmake yourself into a victim. When you speak out, you are in your power. Sochange the situation by taking action or by speaking out if necessary orpossible; leave the situation or accept it. All else is madness.Ordinary unconsciousness is always linked in some way with denial of the Now.The Now, of course, also implies the here. Are you resisting your here and now?Some people would always rather be somewhere else. Their “here” is never goodenough. Through self-observation, find out if that is the case in your life.Wherever you are, be there totally. If you find your here and now intolerableand it makes you unhappy, you have three options: remove yourself from thesituation, change it, or accept it totally. If you want to take responsibilityfor your life, you must choose one of those three options, and you must choosenow. Then accept the consequences. No excuses. No negativity. No psychicpollution. Keep your inner space clear.If you take any action leaving or changing your situation drop the negativityfirst, if at all possible. Action arising out of insight into what is requiredis more effective than action arising out of negativity.Any action is often better than no action, especially if you have been stuck inan unhappy situation for a long time. If it is a mistake, at least you learnsomething, in which case ifs no longer a mistake. If you remain stuck, you learnnothing. Is fear preventing you from taking action? Acknowledge the fear, watchit, take your attention into it, be fully present with it. Doing so cuts thelink between the fear and your thinking. Don't let the fear rise up into pourmind. Use the power of the Now. Fear cannot prevail against it.If there is truly nothing that you can do to change your here and now, and youcan't remove yourself from the situation, then accept your here and now totallyby dropping all inner resistance. The false, unhappy self that loves feelingmiserable, resentful, or sorry for itself can then no longer survive. This iscalled surrender. Surrender is not weakness. There is great strength in it. Onlya surrendered person has spiritual power. Through surrender, you will be freeinternally of the situation. You may then find that the situation changeswithout any effort on your part. In any case,you are free. Or is there something that you “should” be doing but are not doingit? Get up and do it now. Alternatively, completely accept your inactivity,laziness, or passivity at this moment, if that is your choice. Go into it fully.Enjoy it. Be as lazy or inactive as you can. If you go into it fully andconsciously, you will soon come out of it. Or maybe you won't. Either way, thereis no inner conflict, no resistance, no negativity.Are you stressed? Are you so busy getting to the future that the present isreduced to a means of getting there? Stress is caused by being “here” butwanting to be “there,” or being in the present but wanting to be in the future.Its a split that tears you apart inside. To create and live with such an innersplit is insane. The fact that everyone else is doing it doesn't make it anyless insane. If you have to, you can move fast, work fast, or even run, withoutprojecting yourself into the future and without resisting the present. As youmove, work, run do it totally. Enjoy the flow of energy, the high energy of thatmoment. Now you are no longer stressed, no longer splitting yourself in two.Just moving, running, working and enjoying it. Or you can drop the whole thingand sit on a park bench. But when you do, watch your mind. It may say: “Youshould be working. You are wasting time.” Observe the mind. Smile at it.Does the past take up a great deal of your attention? Do you frequently talk andthink about it, either positively or negatively? The great things that you haveachieved, your adventures or experiences, or your victim story and the dreadfulthings that were done to you, or maybe what you did to someone else? Are yourthought processes creating guilt, pride, resentment, anger, regret, orself-pity? Then you are not only reinforcing a false sense of self but alsohelping to accelerate your body's aging process by creating an accumulation ofpast in your psyche. Verify this for yourself by observing those around you whohave a strong tendency to hold on to the past.Die to the past every moment. You dont need it. Only refer to it when it isabsolutely relevant to the present. Feel the power of this moment and thefullness of Being. Feel your presence.¤Are you worried? Do you have many “what if” thoughts? You are identified withyour mind, which is projecting itself into an imaginary future situation andcreating fear. There is no way that you can cope with such a situation, becauseit doesn't exist. It's a mental phantom. You can stop this health- andlife-corroding insanity simply by acknowledging the present moment. Become awareof your breathing. Feel the air flowing in and out of your body. Feel your innerenergy field. All that you ever have to deal with, cope with, in real life asopposed to imaginary mind projections is this moment. Ask yourself what“problem” you have right now, not next year, tomorrow, or five minutes from now.What is wrong with this moment? You can always cope with the Now, but you cannever cope with the future nor do you have to. The answer, the strength, theright action or the resource will be there when you need it, not before, notafter.“One day I'll make it.” Is your goal taking up so much of your attention thatyou reduce the present moment to a means to an end? Is it taking the joy out ofyour doing? Are you waiting to start living? If you develop such a mind pattern,no matter what you achieve or get, the present will never be good enough; thefuture will always seem better. A perfect recipe for permanent dissatisfactionand nonfulfillment, don't you agree?Are you a habitual “waiter”? How much of your life do you spend waiting? What Icall “small-scale waiting” is waiting in line at the post office, in a trafficjam, at the airport, or waiting for someone to arrive, to finish work, and soon. “Large-scale waiting” is waiting for the next vacation, for a better job,for the children to grow up, for a truly meaningful relationship, for success,to make money, to be important, to become enlightened. It is not uncommon forpeople to spend their whole life waiting to start living.Waiting is a state of mind. Basically, it means that you want the future; youdon't want the present. You don't want what you've got, and you want what youhaven't got. With every kind of waiting, you unconsciously create inner conflictbetween your here and now, where you don't want to be, and the projected future,where you want to be. This greatly reduces the quality of your life by makingyou lose the present.There is nothing wrong with striving to improve your life situation. You canimprove your life situation, but you cannot improve your life. Life is primary.Life is your deepest inner Being. It is already whole, complete, perfect. Yourlife situation consists of your circumstances youre your experiences. There isnothing wrong with setting goals and striving to achieve things. The mistakelies in using it as a substitute for the feeling of life, for Being. The onlypoint of access for that is the Now. You are then like an architect who pays noattention to the foundation of a building but spends a lot of time working onthe superstructure.For example, many people are waiting for prosperity. It cannot come in thefuture. When you honor, acknowledge, and fully accept your present reality whereyou are, who you are, what you are doing right now when you fully accept whatyou have got, you are grateful for what you have got, grateful for what is,grateful for Being. Gratitude for the present moment and the fullness of lifenow is true prosperity.It cannot come in the future. Then, in time, that prosperity manifests for youin various ways.If you are dissatisfied with what you have got, or even frustrated or angryabout your present lack, that may motivate you to become rich, but even if youdo make millions, you will continue to experience the inner condition of lack,and deep down you will continue to feel unfulfilled. You may have many excitingexperiences that money can buy, but they will come and go and always leave youwith an empty feeling and the need for further physical or psychologicalgratification. You won't abide in Being and so feel the fullness of life nowthat alone is true prosperity.So give up waiting as a state of mind. When you catch yourself slipping intowaiting . . . snap out of it. Come into the present moment. Just be, and enjoybeing. If you are present, there is never any need for you to wait for anything.So next time somebody says, “Sorry to have kept you waiting,” you can reply,“Thats all right, I wasn't waiting. I was just standing here enjoying myself injoy in my self.”These are just a few of the habitual mind strategies for denying the presentmoment that are part of ordinary unconsciousness. They are easy to overlookbecause they are so much a part of normal living: the background static ofperpetual discontent. But the more you practice monitoring your innermental-emotional state, the easier it will be to know when you have been trappedin past or future, which is to say unconscious, and to awaken out of the dreamof time into the present. But beware: The false, unhappy self, based on mindidentification, lives on time. It knows that the present moment is its own deathand so feels very threatened by it. It will do all it can to take you out of it.It will try to keep you trapped in time."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWTHE INNER PURPOSE OF YOUR LIFE'S JOURNEYI can see the truth of what you are saying, but I still think that we must havepurpose on our life's journey; otherwise we just drift, and purpose meansfuture, doesn't it? How do we reconcile that with living in the present?When you are on a journey, it is certainly helpful to know where you are goingor at least the general direction in which you are moving, but don't forget: theonly thing that is ultimately real about your journey is the step that you aretaking at this moment. Thats all there ever is.Your life's journey has an outer purpose and an inner purpose. The outer purposeis to arrive at your goal or destination, to accomplish what you set out to do,to achieve this or that, which, of course, implies future. But if yourdestination, or the steps you are going to take in the future, take up so muchof your attention that they become more important to you than the step you aretaking now, then you completely miss the journey's inner purpose, which hasnothing to do with where you are going or what you are doing, but everything todo with how. It has nothing to do with future but everything to do with thequality of your consciousness at this moment. The outer purpose belongs to thehorizontal dimension of space and time; the inner purpose concerns a deepeningof your Being in the vertical dimension of the timeless Now. Your outer journeymay contain a million steps; your inner journey only has one: the step you aretaking right now. As you become more deeply aware of this one step, you realizethat it already contains within itself all the other steps as well as thedestination. This one step then becomes transformed into an expression ofperfection, an act of great beauty and quality. It will have taken you intoBeing, and the light of Being will shine through it. This is both the purposeand the fulfillment of your inner journey, the journey into yourself.¤Does it matter whether we achieve our outer purpose, whether we succeed or failin the world?It will matter to you as long as you haven't realized your inner purpose. Afterthat, the outer purpose is just a game that you may continue to play simplybecause you enjoy it. It is also possible to fail completely in your outerpurpose and at the same time totally succeed in your inner purpose. Or the otherway around, which is actually more common: outer riches and inner poverty, or to“gain the world and lose your soul,” as Jesus puts it. Ultimately, of course,every outer purpose is doomed to “fail” sooner or later, simply because it issubject to the law of impermanence of all things. The sooner you realize thatyour outer purpose cannot give you lasting fulfillment, the better. When youhave seen the limitations of your outer purpose, you give up your unrealisticexpectation that it should make you happy, and you make it subservient to yourinner purpose."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWTHE PAST CANNOT SURVIVE IN YOUR PRESENCEYou mentioned that thinking or talking about the past unnecessarily is one ofthe ways in which we avoid the present. But apart from the past that we rememberand perhaps identify with, isn't there another level of past within us that ismuch more deep-seated? I am talking about the unconscious past that conditionsour lives, especially through early childhood experiences, perhaps evenpast-life experiences. And then there is our cultural conditioning, which has todo with where we live geographically and the historical time period in which welive. All these things determine how we see the world, how we react, what wethink, what kind of relationships we have, how we live our lives. How could weever become conscious of all that or get rid of it? How long would that take?And even if we did, what would there be left?What is left when illusion ends? There is no need to investigate the unconsciouspast in you except as it manifests at this moment as a thought, an emotion, adesire, a reaction, or an external event that happens to you. Whatever you needto know about the unconscious past in you, the challenges of the present willbring it out. If you delve into the past, it will become a bottomless pit: Thereis always more. You may think that you need more time to understand the past orbecome free of it, in other words, that the future will eventually free you ofthe past. This is a delusion. Only the present can free you of the past. Moretime cannot free you of time. Access the power of Now. That is the key. What isthe power of Now?None other than the power of your presence, your consciousness liberated fromthought forms.So deal with the past on the level of the present. The more attention you giveto the past, the more you energize it, and the more likely you are to make a“self” out of it. Dont misunderstand: Attention is essential, but not to thepast as past. Give attention to the present; give attention to your behavior, toyour reactions, moods, thoughts, emotions, fears,and desires as they occur in the present. There's the past in you. If you can bepresent enough to watch all those things, not critically or analytically butnonjudgmentally, then you are dealing with the past and dissolving it throughthe power of your presence. You cannot find yourself by going into the past. Youfind yourself by coming into the present.Isn't it helpful to understand the past and so understand why we do certainthings, react in certain ways, or why we unconsciously create our particularkind of drama, patterns in relationships, and so on?As you become more conscious of your present reality, you may suddenly getcertain insights as to why your conditioning functions in those particular ways;for example, why your relationships follow certain patterns, and you mayremember things that happened in the past or see them more dearly. That is fineand can be helpful, but it is not essential. What is essential is your consciouspresence. That dissolves the past. That is the transformative agent. So don'tseek to understand the past, but be as present as you can. The past cannotsurvive in your presence. It can only survive in your absence."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOW"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWTHE STATE OF PRESENCE"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWIT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT ISYou keep talking about the state of presence as the key. I think I understand itintellectually, but I don't know if I have ever truly experienced it. I wonderis it what I think it is, or is it something entirely different?Its not what you think it is! You can't think about presence, and the mind can'tunderstand it. Understanding presence is being present.Try a little experiment. Close your eyes and say to yourself: “I wonder what mynext thought is going to be.” Then become very alert and wait for the nextthought. Be like a cat watching a mouse hole. What thought is going to come outof the mouse hole? Try it now.¤Well?I had to wait for quite a long time before a thought came in.Exactly. As long as you are in a state of intense presence, you are free ofthought. You are still, yet highly alert. The instant your conscious attentionsinks below a certain level, thought rushes in. The mental noise returns; thestillness is lost. You are back in time.To test their degree of presence, some Zen masters have been known to creep upon their students from behind and suddenly hit them with a stick. Quite a shock!If the student had been fully present and in a state of alertness, if he had“kept his loin girded and his lamp burning,” which is one of the analogies thatJesus uses for presence, he would have noticed the master coming up from behindand stopped him or stepped aside. But if he were hit, that would mean he wasimmersed in thought, which is to say absent, unconscious.To stay present in everyday life, it helps to be deeply rooted within yourselfotherwise, the mind, which has incredible momentum, will drag you along like awild river.What do you mean by “rooted within yourself”?It means to inhabit your body fully. To always have some of your attention inthe inner energy field of your body. To feel the body from within, so to speak.Body awareness keeps you present. It anchors you in the Now (see Chapter 6)."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWTHE ESOTERIC MEANING OF “WAITING”In a sense, the state of presence could be compared to waiting. Jesus used theanalogy of waiting in some of his parables. This is not the usual bored orrestless kind of waiting that is a denial of the present and that I spoke aboutalready. It is not a waiting in which your attention is focused on some point inthe future and the present is perceived as an undesirable obstacle that preventsyou from having what you want. There is a qualitatively different kind ofwaiting, one that requires your total alertness. Something could happen at anymoment, and if you are not absolutely awake, absolutely still, you will miss it.This is the kind of waiting Jesus talks about. In that state, all your attentionis in the Now. There is none left for daydreaming, thinking, remembering,anticipating. There is no tension in it, no fear, just alert presence. You arepresent with your whole Being, with every cell of your body. In that state, the“you” that has a past and a future, the personality if you like, is hardly thereanymore. And yet nothing of value is lost. You are still essentially yourself.In fact, you are more fully yourself than you ever were before, or rather it isonly now that you are truly yourself.“Be like a servant waiting for the return of the master,” says Jesus. Theservant does not know at what hour the master is going to come. So he staysawake, alert, poised, still, lest he miss the master's arrival. In anotherparable, Jesus speaks of the five careless (unconscious) women who do not haveenough oil (consciousness) to keep their lamps burning (stay present) and somiss the bridegroom (the Now) and don't get to the wedding feast(enlightenment). These five stand in contrast to the five wise women who haveenough oil (stay conscious).Even the men who wrote the Gospels did not understand the meaning of theseparables, so the first misinterpretations and distortions crept in as they werewritten down. With subsequent erroneous interpretations, the real meaning wascompletely lost. These are parables not about the end of the world but about theend of psychological time. They point to the transcendence of the egoic mind andthe possibility of living in an entirely new state of consciousness."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWBEAUTY ARISES IN THE STILLNESS OF YOUR PRESENCEWhat you have just described is something that I occasionally experience forbrief moments when I am alone and surrounded by nature.Yes. Zen masters use the word satori to describe a flash of insight, a moment ofno-mind and total presence. Although satori is not a lasting transformation, begrateful when it comes, for it gives you a taste of enlightenment. You may,indeed, have experienced it many times without knowing what it is and realizingits importance. Presence is needed to become aware of the beauty, the majesty,the sacredness of nature. Have you ever gazed up into the infinity of space on aclear night, awestruck by the absolute stillness and inconceivable vastness ofit? Have you listened, truly listened, to the sound of a mountain stream in theforest? Or to the song of a blackbird at dusk on a quiet summer evening?To become aware of such things, the mind needs to be still. You have to put downfor a moment your personal baggage of problems, of past and future, as well asall your knowledge; otherwise, you will see but not see, hear but not hear. Yourtotal presence is required.Beyond the beauty of the external forms, there is more here: something thatcannot be named, something ineffable, some deep, inner, holy essence. Wheneverand wherever there is beauty, this inner essence shines through somehow. It onlyreveals itself to you when you are present. Could it be that this namelessessence and your presence are one and the same? Would it be there without yourpresence? Go deeply into it. Find out for yourself.¤When you experienced those moments of presence, you 101 likely didn't realizethat you were briefly in a state of no- mind. This is because the gap betweenthat state and the influx of thought was too narrow. Your satori may only havelasted for a few seconds before the mind came in, but it was there; otherwise,you would not have experienced the beauty. Mind can neither recognize nor createbeauty. Only for a few seconds, while you were completely present, was thatbeauty or that sacredness there. Because of the narrowness of that gap and alack of vigilance and alertness on your part, you were probably unable to seethe fundamental difference between the perception, the thought-less awareness ofbeauty,and the naming and interpreting of it as thought: The time gap was so small thatit seemed to be a single process. The truth is, however, that the moment thoughtcame in, all you had was a memory of it.The wider the time gap between perception and thought, the more depth there isto you as a human being, which is to say the more conscious you are.Many people are so imprisoned in their minds that the beauty of nature does notreally exist for them. They might say, “What a pretty flower,” but thats just amechanical mental labeling. Because they are not still, not present, they don'ttruly see the flower, don't feel its essence, its holiness just as they don'tknow themselves, don't feel their own essence, their own holiness.Because we live in such a mind-dominated culture, most modem art, architecture,music, and literature are devoid of beauty, of inner essence, with very fewexceptions. The reason is that the people who create those things cannot evenfor a moment free themselves from their mind. So they are never in touch withthat place within where tree creativity and beauty arise. The mind left toitself creates monstrosities, and not only in art galleries. Look at our urbanlandscapes and industrial wastelands. No civilization has ever produced so muchugliness."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWREALIZING PURE CONSCIOUSNESSIs presence the same as Being?When you become conscious of Being, what is really happening is that Beingbecomes conscious of itself. When Being becomes conscious of itself thatspresence. Since Being, consciousness, and life are synonymous, we could say thatpresence means consciousness becoming conscious of itself, or life attainingself-consciousness. But don't get attached to the words, and don't make aneffort to understand this. There is nothing that you need to understand beforeyou can become present.I do understand what you just said, but it seems to imply that Being, theultimate transcendental reality, is not yet complete, that it is undergoing aprocess of development. Does God need time for personal growth?Yes, but only as seen from the limited perspective of the manifested universe.In the Bible, God declares: “I am the Alpha and the Omega, and I am the livingOne.” In the timeless realm where God dwells, which is also your home, thebeginning and the end, the Alpha and the Omega, are one,and the essence of everything that ever has been and ever will be is eternallypresent in an unmanifested state of oneness and perfection totally beyondanything the human mind can ever imagine or comprehend. In our world ofseemingly separate forms, however, timeless perfection is an inconceivableconcept. Here even consciousness, which is the light emanating from the eternalSource, seems to be subject to a process of development, but this is due to ourlimited perception. It is not so in absolute terms. Nevertheless, let mecontinue to speak for a moment about the evolution of consciousness in thisworld. Everything that exists has Being, has God-essence, has some degree ofconsciousness. Even a stone has rudimentary consciousness; otherwise, it wouldnot be, and its atoms and molecules would disperse. Everything is alive. Thesun, the earth, plants, animals, humans all are expressions of consciousness invarying degrees, consciousness manifesting as form.The world arises when consciousness takes on shapes and forms, thought forms andmaterial forms. Look at the millions of life forms on this planet alone. In thesea, on land,in the air and then each life form is replicated millions of times. To what end?Is someone or something playing a game, a game with form? This is what theancient seers of India asked themselves. They saw the world as lila, a kind ofdivine game that God is playing. The individual life forms are obviously notvery important in this game. In the sea, most life forms don't survive for morethan a few minutes after being born. The human form turns to dust pretty quicklytoo, and when it is gone it is as if it had never been. Is that tragic or cruel?Only if you create a separate identity for each form, if you forget that itsconsciousness is God- essence expressing itself in form. But you don't trulyknow that until you realize your own God-essence as pure consciousness.If a fish is born in your aquarium and you call it John, write out a birthcertificate, tell him about his family history, and two minutes later he getseaten by another fish thats tragic. But ifs only tragic because you projected aseparate self where there was none. You got hold of a fraction of a dynamicprocess, a molecular dance, and made a separate entity out of it.Consciousness takes on the disguise of forms until they reach such complexitythat it completely loses itself in them. In present-day humans, consciousness iscompletely identified with its disguise. It only knows itself as form andtherefore lives in fear of the annihilation of its physical or psychologicalform. This is the egoic mind, and this is where considerable dysfunction setsin. It now looks as if something had gone very wrong somewhere along the line ofevolution. But even this is part of lila, the divine game. Finally, the pressureof suffering created by this apparent dysfunction forces consciousness todisidentify from form and awakens it from its dream of form: It regains self-consciousness, but it is at a far deeper level than when it lost it.This process is explained by Jesus in his parable of the lost son, who leaveshis father's home, squanders his wealth, becomes destitute, and is then forcedby his suffering to return home. When he does, his father loves him more thanbefore. The son's state is the same as it was before, yet not the same. It hasan added dimension of depth. The parable describes a journey from unconsciousperfection, through apparent imperfection and “evil” to conscious perfection.Can you now see the deeper and wider significance of becoming present as thewatcher of your mind? Whenever you watch the mind, you withdraw consciousnessfrom mind forms, which then becomes what we call the watcher or the witness.Consequently, the watcher pure consciousness beyond form becomes stronger, andthe mental formations become weaker. When we talk about watching the mind we arepersonalizing an event that is truly of cosmic significance: through you,consciousness is awakening out of its dream of identification with form andwithdrawing from form. This foreshadows, but is already part of, an event thatis probably still in the distant future as far as chronological time isconcerned. The event is called the end of the world.¤ When consciousness frees itself from its identification with physical andmental forms, it becomes what we may call pure or enlightened consciousness, orpresence. This has already happened in a few individuals, and it seems destinedto happen soon on a much larger scale, although there is no absolute guaranteethat it will happen. Most humans are still in the grip of the egoic mode ofconsciousness: identified with their mind and run by their mind. If they do notfree themselves from their mind in time, they will be destroyed by it. They willexperience increasing confusion, conflict, violence, illness, despair, madness.Egoic mind has become like a sinking ship. If you dont get off, you will go downwith it. The collective egoic mind is the most dangerously insane anddestructive entity ever to inhabit this planet. What do you think will happen onthis planet if human consciousness remains unchanged?Already for most humans, the only respite they find from their own minds is tooccasionally revert to a level of consciousness below thought. Everyone doesthat every night during sleep. But this also happens to some extent through sex,alcohol, and other drugs that suppress excessive mind activity. If it weren'tfor alcohol, tranquilizers, antidepressants, as well as the illegal drugs, whichare all consumed in vast quantities, the insanity of the human mind would becomeeven more glaringly obvious than it is already.I believe that, if deprived of their drugs, a large part of the population wouldbecome a danger to themselves and others. These drugs, of course, simply keepyou stuck in dysfunction.Their widespread use only delays the breakdown of the old mind structures andthe emergence of higher consciousness. While individual users may get somerelief from the daily torture inflicted on them by their minds, they areprevented from generating enough conscious presence to rise above thought and sofind true liberation.Falling back to a level of consciousness below mind, which is the pre-thinkinglevel of our distant ancestors and of animals and plants, is not an option forus. There is no way back. If the human race is to survive, it will have to go onto the next stage. Consciousness is evolving throughout the universe in billionsof forms. So even if we didn't make it, this wouldn't matter on a cosmic scale.No gain in consciousness is ever lost, so it would simply express itself throughsome other form. But the very fact that I am speaking here and you are listeningor reading this is a clear sign that the new consciousness is gaining a footholdon the planet.There is nothing personal in this: I am not teaching you. You are consciousness,and you are listening to yourself. There is an Eastern saying: “The teacher andthe taught together create the teaching.” In any case, the words in themselvesare not important. They are not the Truth; they only point to it. I speak frompresence, and as I speak, you may be able to join me in that state. Althoughevery word that I use has a history, of course, and comes from the past, as alllanguage does, the words that I speak to you now are carriers of the high-energyfrequency of presence, quite apart from the meaning they convey as words.Silence is an even more potent carrier of presence, so when you read this orlisten to me speak, be aware of the silence between and underneath the words. Beaware of the gaps. To listen to the silence, wherever you are, is an easy anddirect way of becoming present. Even if there is noise, there is always somesilence underneath and in between the sounds. Listening to the silenceimmediately creates stillness inside you. Only the stillness in you can perceivethe silence outside. And what is stillness other than presence, consciousnessfreed from thought forms? Here is the living realization of what we have beentalking about.¤"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWCHRIST: THE REALITY OF YOUR DIVINE PRESENCEDon't get attached to any one word. You can substitute “Christ” for presence, ifthat is more meaningful to you. Christ is your God-essence or the Self, as it issometimes called in the East. The only difference between Christ and presence isthat Christ refers to your indwelling divinity regardless of whether you areconscious of it or not, whereas presence means your awakened divinity orGod-essence.Many misunderstandings and false beliefs about Christ will clear if you realizethat there is no past or future in Christ. To say that Christ was or will be isa contradiction in terms. Jesus was. He was a man who lived two thousand yearsago and realized divine presence, his true nature. And so he said: “BeforeAbraham was, I am.” He did not say. “I already existed before Abraham was born.”That would have meant that he was still within the dimension of time and formidentity. The words I am used in a sentence that starts in the past tenseindicate a radical shift, a discontinuity in the temporal dimension. It is aZen-like statement of great profundity. Jesus attempted to convey directly, notthrough discursive thought, the meaning of presence, of self- realization. Hehad gone beyond the consciousness dimension governed by time, into the realm ofthe timeless. The dimension of eternity had come into this world. Eternity, ofcourse, does not mean endless time, but no time. Thus, the man Jesus becameChrist, a vehicle for pure consciousness. And what is God's self-definition inthe Bible? Did God say “I have always been, and I always will be?” Of coursenot. That would have given reality to past and future. God said: “ I AM THAT IAM .” No time here, just presence.The “second coming” of Christ is a transformation of human consciousness, ashift from time to presence, from thinking to pure consciousness, not thearrival of some man or woman. If “Christ” were to return tomorrow in someexternalized form, what could he or she possibly say to you other than this: “Iam the Truth. I am divine presence. I am eternal life. I am within you. I amhere. I am Now.”¤Never personalize Christ. Don't make Christ into a form identity. Avatars,divine mothers, enlightened masters, the very few that are real, are not specialas persons. Without a false self to uphold, defend, and feed, they are moresimple, more ordinary than the ordinary man or woman. Anyone with a strong egowould regard them as insignificant or, more likely, not see them at all.If you are drawn to an enlightened teacher, it is because there is alreadyenough presence in you to recognize presence in another. There were many peoplewho did not recognize Jesus or the Buddha, as there are and always have beenmany people who are drawn to false teachers. Egos are drawn to bigger egos.Darkness cannot recognize light. Only light can recognize light. So don'tbelieve that the light is outside you or that it can only come through oneparticular form. If only your master is an incarnation of God, then who are you?Any kind of exclusivity is identification with form, and identification withform means ego, no matter how well disguised.Use the master's presence to reflect your own identity beyond name and form backto you and to become more intensely present yourself. You will soon realize thatthere is no “mine” or “yours” in presence. Presence is one.Group work can also be helpful for intensifying the light of your presence. Agroup of people coming together in a state of presence generates a collectiveenergy field of great intensity. It not only raises the degree of presence ofeach member of the group but also helps to free the collective humanconsciousness from its current state of mind dominance. This will make the stateof presence increasingly more accessible to individuals. However, unless atleast one member of the group is already firmly established in it and thus canhold the energy frequency of that state, the egoic mind can easily reassertitself and sabotage the group's endeavors. Although group work is invaluable, itis not enough, and you must not come to depend on it. Nor must you come todepend on a teacher or a master, except during the transitional period, when youare learning the meaning and practice of presence."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOW"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIX"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWTHE INNER BODY"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWBEING IS YOUR DEEPEST SELFYou spoke earlier about the importance of having deep roots within or inhabitingthe body. Can you explain what you meant by that?The body can become a point of access into the realm of Being. Lets go into thatmore deeply now.I am still not quite sure if I fully understand what you mean by Being.“Water? What do you mean by that? I don't understand it.” This is what a fishwould say if it had a human mind.Please stop trying to understand Being. You have already had significantglimpses of Being, but the mind will always try to squeeze it into a little boxand then put a label on it. It cannot be done. It cannot become an object ofknowledge. In Being, subject and object merge into one.Being can be felt as the ever-present I am that is beyond name and form. To feeland thus to know that you are and to abide in that deeply rooted state isenlightenment, is the truth that Jesus says will make you free.Free from what?Free from the illusion that you are nothing more than your 111 physical body andyour mind. This “illusion of the self,” as the Buddha calls it, is the coreerror. Free from fear in its countless disguises as the inevitable consequenceof that illusion the fear that is your constant tormentor as long as you deriveyour sense of self only from this ephemeral and vulnerable form.

It implies that I am being judged and found guilty.I can understand that. Over the centuries, many erroneous views andinterpretations have accumulated around words such as sin, due to ignorance,misunderstanding, or a desire to control, but they contain an essential core oftruth. If you are unable to look beyond such interpretations and so cannotrecognize the reality to which the word points, then dont use it. Dont get stuckon the level of words. A word is no more than a means to an end. It's anabstraction. Not unlike a signpost, it points beyond itself. The word honey isnthoney. You can study and talk about honey for as long as you like, but you won'treally know it until you taste it. After you have tasted it, the word becomesless important to you. You won't be attached to it anymore. Similarly, you cantalk or think about God continuously for the rest of your life, but does thatmean you know or have even glimpsed the reality to which the word points? Itreally is no more than an obsessive attachment to a signpost, a mental idol.The reverse also applies: If, for whatever reason, you 112 disliked the wordhoney, that might prevent you from ever tasting it. If you had a strong aversionto the word God, which is a negative form of attachment, you may be denying notjust the word but also the reality to which it points. You would be cuttingyourself off from the possibility of experiencing that reality. All this is, ofcourse, intrinsically connected with being identified with your mind.So, if a word doesnt work for you anymore, then drop it and replace it with onethat does work. If you dont like the word sin, then call it unconsciousness orinsanity. That may get you closer to the truth, the reality behind the word,than a long-misused word like sin, and leaves little room for guilt.I don't like those words either. They imply that there is something wrong withme. I am being judged.Of course there is something wrong with you and you are not being judged.I don't mean to offend you personally, but do you not belong to the human racethat has killed over mo million members of their own species in the twentiethcentury alone?You mean guilt by association?It is not a question of guilt. But as long as you are run by the egoic mind, youare part of the collective insanity. Perhaps you havent looked very deeply intothe human condition in its state of dominance by the egoic mind. Open your eyesand see the fear, the despair, the greed, and the violence that areall-pervasive. See the heinous cruelty and suffering on an unimaginable scalethat humans have inflicted and continue to inflict on each other as well as onother life forms on the planet. You don't need to condemn. Just observe. That issin. That is insanity. That is unconsciousness. Above all, don't forget toobserve your own mind. Seek out the root of the insanity there."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWFINDING YOUR INVISIBLE AND INDESTRUCTIBLE REALITYYou said that identification with our physical form is part of the illusion, sohow can the body, the physical form, bring you to a realization of Being?The body that you can see and touch cannot take you into Being. But that visibleand tangible body is only an outer shell, or rather a limited and distortedperception of a deeper reality. In your natural state of connectedness withBeing, this deeper reality can be felt every moment as the invisible inner body,the animating presence within you. So to “inhabit the body” is to feel the bodyfrom within, to feel the life inside the body and thereby come to know that youare beyond the outer form.But that is only the beginning of an inward journey that will take you ever moredeeply into a realm of great stillness and peace, yet also of great power andvibrant life. At first, you may only get fleeting glimpses of it, but throughthem you will begin to realize that you are not just a meaningless fragment inan alien universe, briefly suspended between birth and death, allowed a fewshort-lived pleasures followed by pain and ultimate annihilation. Underneathyour outer form, you are connected with something so vast, so immeasurable andsacred, that it cannot be conceived or spoken of yet I am speaking of it now. Iam speaking of it not to give you something to believe in but to show you howyou can know it for yourself.You are cut off from Being as long as your mind takes up all your attention.When this happens and it happens continuously for most people you are not inyour body. The mind absorbs all your consciousness and transforms it into mindstuff. You cannot stop thinking. Compulsive thinking has become a collectivedisease. Your whole sense of who you are is then derived from mind activity.Your identity, as it is no longer rooted in Being, becomes a vulnerable andever-needy mental construct, which creates fear as the predominant underlyingemotion. The one thing that truly matters is then missing from your life:awareness of your deeper self your invisible and indestructible reality.To become conscious of Being, you need to reclaim consciousness from the mind.This is one of the most essential tasks on your spiritual journey. It will freevast amounts of consciousness that previously had been trapped in useless andcompulsive thinking. A very effective way of doing this is simply to take thefocus of your attention away from thinking and direct it into the body, whereBeing can be felt in the first instance as the invisible energy field that giveslife to what you perceive as the physical body."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWCONNECTING WITH THE INNER BODYPlease try it now. You may find it helpful to close your eyes for this practice.Later on, when “being in the body” has become natural and easy, this will nolonger be necessary. Direct your attention into the body.

Can you feel the subtle energy field that pervades the entire bodyand gives vibrant life to every organ and every cell? Can you feel itsimultaneously in all parts of the body as a single field of energy? Keepfocusing on the feeling of your inner body for a few moments. Do not start tothink about it. Feel it. The more attention you give it, the clearer andstronger this feeling will become. It will feel as if every cell is becomingmore alive, and if you have a strong visual sense, you may get an image of yourbody becoming luminous. Although such an image can help you temporarily, paymore attention to the feeling than to any image that may arise. An image, nomatter how beautiful or powerful, is already defined in form, so there is lessscope for penetrating more deeply.¤The feeling of your inner body is formless, limitless, and unfathomable. You canalways go into it more deeply. If you cannot feel very much at this stage, payattention to whatever you can feel. Perhaps there is just a slight tingling inyour hands or feet.

It seems that spiritualseekers have always regarded the body as a hindrance or even as sinful. Why haveso few seekers become finders? On the level of the body, humans are very dose toanimals. All the basic bodily functions pleasure, pain, breathing, eating,drinking, defecating, sleeping, the drive to find a mate and procreate, and ofcourse birth and death we share with the animals. A long time after their fallfrom a state of grace and oneness into illusion, humans suddenly woke up in whatseemed to be an animal body and they found this very disturbing. “Don't foolyourself. You are no more than an animal.” This seemed to be the truth that wasstaring them in the face. But it was too disturbing a truth to tolerate. Adamand Eve saw that they were naked, and they became afraid. Unconscious denial oftheir animal nature set in very quickly. The threat that they might be takenover by powerful instinctual drives and revert back to complete unconsciousnesswas indeed a very real one. Shame and taboos appeared around certain parts ofthe body and bodily functions, especially sexuality. The light of theirconsciousness was not yet strong enough to make friends with their animalnature, to allow it to be and even enjoy that aspect of themselves let alone togo deeply into it to find the divine hidden within it, the reality within theillusion. So they did what they had to do. They began to disassociate from theirbody. They now saw themselves as having a body, rather than just being it.When religions arose, this disassociation became even more pronounced as the“you are not your body” belief. Countless people in East and West throughout theages have tried to find God, salvation, or enlightenment through denial of thebody. This took the form of denial of sense pleasures and of sexuality inparticular, fasting, and other ascetic practices. They even inflicted pain onthe body in an attempt to weaken or punish it because they regarded it assinful. In Christianity, this used to be called mortification of the flesh.Others tried to escape from the body by entering trance states or seekingout-of-the-body experiences. Many still do. Even the Buddha is said to havepracticed body denial through fasting and extreme forms of asceticism for sixyears, but he did not attain enlightenment until after he had given up thispractice.The fact is that no one has ever become enlightened through denying or fightingthe body or through an out-of- the-body experience. Although such an experiencecan be fascinating and can give you a glimpse of the state of liberation fromthe material form, in the end you will always have to return to the body, wherethe essential work of transformation takes place. Transformation is through thebody, not away from it. This is why no true master has ever advocated fightingor leaving the body, although their mind- based followers often have.Of the ancient teachings concerning the body, only certain fragments survive,such as Jesus's statement that “your whole body will be filled with light,” orthey survive as myths, such as the belief that Jesus never relinquished his bodybut remained one with it and ascended into “heaven” with it. Almost no one tothis day has understood those fragments or the hidden meaning of certain myths,and the “you are not your body” belief has prevailed universally, leading tobody denial and attempts to escape from the body. Countless seekers have thusbeen prevented from attaining spiritual realization for themselves and becomingfinders.Is it possible to recover the lost teachings on the significance of the body orto reconstruct them from the existing fragments?There is no need for that. All spiritual teachings originate from the sameSource. In that sense, there is and always has been only one master, whomanifests in many different forms.I am that master, and so are you, once you are able to access the Source within.And the way to it is through the inner body. Although all spiritual teachingsoriginate from the same Source, once they become verbalized and written downthey are obviously no more than collections of words and a word is nothing but asignpost, as we talked about earlier. All such teachings are signposts pointingthe way back to the Source.I have already spoken of the Truth that is hidden within your body, but I willsummarize for you again the lost teachings of the masters so here is anothersignpost. Please endeavor to feel your inner body as you read or listen."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWSERMON ON THE BODYWhat you perceive as a dense physical structure called the body, which issubject to disease, old age, and death, is not ultimately real is not you. It isa misperception of your essential reality that is beyond birth and death, and isdue to the limitations of your mind, which, having lost touch with Being,creates the body as evidence of its illusory belief in separation and to justifyits state of fear. But do not turn away from the body, for within that symbol ofimpermanence, limitation, and death that you perceive as the illusory creationof your mind is concealed the splendor of your essential and immortal reality.Do not turn your attention elsewhere in your search for the Truth, for it isnowhere else to be found but within your body.Do not fight against the body, for in doing so you are fighting against your ownreality. You are your body. The body that you can see and touch is only a thinillusory veil. Underneath it lies the invisible inner body, the doorway intoBeing, into Life Unmanifested. Through the inner body, you are inseparablyconnected to this unmanifested One Life birthless, deathless, eternally present.Through the inner body, you are forever one with God. ¤"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWHAVE DEEP ROOTS WITHINThe key is to be in a state of permanent connectedness with your inner body tofeel it at all times. This will rapidly deepen and transform your life. The moreconsciousness you direct into the inner body, the higher its vibrationalfrequency becomes, much like a light that grows brighter as you turn up thedimmer switch and so increase the flow of electricity. At this higher energylevel, negativity cannot affect you anymore, and you tend to attract newcircumstances that reflect this higher frequency.If you keep your attention in the body as much as possible, you will be anchoredin the Now. You won't lose yourself in the external world, and you wont loseyourself in your mind. Thoughts and emotions, fears and desires, may still bethere to some extent, but they won't take you over.Please examine where your attention is at this moment. You are listening to me,or you are reading these words in a book. That is the focus of your attention.You are also peripherally aware of your surroundings, other people, and so on.Furthermore, there may be some mind activity around what you are hearing orreading, some mental commentary. Yet there is no need for any of this to absorball your attention. See if you can be in touch with your inner body at the sametime. Keep some of your attention within. Dont let it all flow out. Feel yourwhole body from within, as a single field of energy. It is almost as if you werelistening or reading with your whole body. Let this be your practice in the daysand weeks to come.Do not give all your attention away to the mind and the external world. By allmeans focus on what you are doing, but feel the inner body at the same timewhenever possible. Stay rooted within. Then observe how this changes your stateof consciousness and the quality of what you are doing.Whenever you are waiting, wherever it may be, use that time to feel the innerbody. In this way, traffic jams and line- ups become very enjoyable. Instead ofmentally projecting yourself away from the Now, go more deeply into the Now bygoing more deeply into the body.The art of inner-body awareness will develop into a completely new way ofliving, a state of permanent connectedness with Being, and will add a depth toyour life that you have never known before.It is easy to stay present as the observer of your mind when you are deeplyrooted within your body. No matter what happens on the outside, nothing canshake you anymore.Unless you stay present and inhabiting your body is always an essential aspectof it you will continue to be run by your mind. The script in your head that youlearned a long time ago, the conditioning of your mind, will dictate yourthinking and your behavior. You may be free of it for brief intervals, butrarely for long. This is especially true when something “goes wrong” or there issome loss or upset. Your conditioned reaction will then be involuntary,automatic, and predictable, fueled by the one basic emotion that underlies themind-identified state of consciousness: fear.So when such challenges come, as they always do, make it a habit to go within atonce and focus as much as you can on the inner energy field of your body. Thisneed not take long, just a few seconds. But you need to do it the moment thatthe challenge presents itself. Any delay will allow a conditionedmental-emotional reaction to arise and take you over. When you focus within andfeel the inner body, you immediately become still and present as you arewithdrawing consciousness from the mind. If a response is required in thatsituation, it will come up from this deeper level. Just as the sun is infinitelybrighter than a candle flame,there is infinitely more intelligence in Being than in your mind. As long as youare in conscious contact with your inner body, you are like a tree that isdeeply rooted in the earth, or a building with a deep and solid foundation. Thelatter analogy is used by Jesus in the generally misunderstood parable of thetwo men who build a house. One man builds it on the sand, without a foundation,and when the storms and floods come, the house is swept away. The other man digsdeep until he reaches the rock, then builds his house, which is not swept awayby the floods."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWBEFORE YOU ENTER THE BODY, FORGIVEI felt very uncomfortable when I tried to put my attention on the inner body.There was a feeling of agitation and some nausea. So I haven't been able toexperience what you are talking about.What you felt was a lingering emotion that you were probably unaware of, untilyou started putting some attention into the body. Unless you first give it someattention, the emotion will prevent you from gaining access to the inner body,which lies at a deeper level underneath it. Attention does not mean that youstart thinking about it. It means to just observe the emotion, to feel it fully,and so to acknowledge and accept it as it is. Some emotions are easilyidentified: anger, fear, grief, and so on. Others may be much harder to label.They may just be vague feelings of unease, heaviness, or constriction, halfwaybetween an emotion and a physical sensation. In any case, what matters is notwhether you can attach a mental label to it but whether you can bring thefeeling of it into awareness as much as possible. Attention is the key totransformation and full attention also implies acceptance. Attention is like abeam of light the focused power of your consciousness that transmutes everythinginto itself.In a fully functional organism, an emotion has a very short life span. It islike a momentary ripple or wave on the surface of your Being. When you are notin your body, however, an emotion can survive inside you for days or weeks, orjoin with other emotions of a similar frequency that have merged and become thepain-body, a parasite that can live inside you for years, feed on your energy,lead to physical illness, and make your life miserable (see Chapter 2).So place your attention on feeling the emotion, and check whether your mind isholding on to a grievance pattern such as blame, self-pity, or resentment thatis feeding the emotion. If that is the case, it means that you haven't forgiven.Nonforgiveness is often toward another person or yourself, but it may just aswell be toward any situation or condition past, present or future that your mindrefuses to accept. Yes, there can be nonforgiveness even with regard to thefuture. This is the mind's refusal to accept uncertainty, to accept that thefuture is ultimately beyond its control. Forgiveness is to relinquish yourgrievance and so to let go of grief. It happens naturally once you realize thatyour grievance serves no purpose except to strengthen a false sense of self.Forgiveness is to offer no resistance to life to allow life to live through you.The alternatives are pain and suffering, a greatly restricted flow of lifeenergy, and in many cases physical disease.The moment you truly forgive, you have reclaimed your power from the mind.Nonforgiveness is the very nature of the mind, just as the mind-made false self,the ego, cannot survive without strife and conflict. The mind cannot forgive.Only you can. You become present, you enter your body, you feel the vibrantpeace and stillness that emanate from Being. That is why Jesus said: “Before youenter the temple, forgive.” ¤"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWYOUR LINK WITH THE UNMANIFESTEDWhat is the relationship between presence and the inner body?Presence is pure consciousness consciousness that has been reclaimed from themind, from the world of form. The inner body is your link with the Unmanifested,and in its deepest aspect is the Unmanifested: the Source from whichconsciousness emanates as light emanates from the sun. Awareness of the innerbody is consciousness remembering its origin and returning to the Source.Is the Unmanifested the same as Being?Yes. The word Unmanifested attempts, by way of negation, to express That whichcannot be spoken, thought or imagined.It points to what it is by saying what it is not. Being, on the other hand, is apositive term. Please don't get attached to either of these words or startbelieving in them. They are no more than signposts.You said that presence is consciousness that has been reclaimed from the mind.Who does the reclaiming?You do. But since in your essence you are consciousness, we might as well saythat it is an awakening of consciousness from the dream of form. This does notmean that your own form will instantly vanish in an explosion of light. You cancontinue in your present form yet be aware of the formless and deathless deepwithin you.I must admit that this is way beyond my comprehension, and yet on some deeperlevel I seem to know what you are talking about. It's more like a feeling thananything else. Am I deceiving myself?No, you are not. Feeling will get you closer to the truth of who you are thanthinking. I cannot tell you anything that deep within you don't already know.When you have reached a certain stage of inner connectedness, you recognize thetruth when you hear it. If you haven't reached that stage yet, the practice ofbody awareness will bring about the deepening that is necessary."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWSLOWING DOWN THE AGING PROCESSIn the meantime, awareness of the inner body has other benefits in the physicalrealm. One of them is a significant slowing down of the aging of the physicalbody.Whereas the outer body normally appears to grow old and wither fairly quickly,the inner body does not change with time, except that you may feel it moredeeply and become it more fully. If you are twenty years old now, the energyfield of your inner body will feel just the same when you are eighty. It will bejust as vibrantly alive. As soon as your habitual state changes from beingout-of-the-body and trapped in your mind to being in-the-body and present in theNow, your physical body will feel lighter, clearer, more alive.As there is more consciousness in the body, its molecular structure actuallybecomes less dense. More consciousness means a lessening of the illusion ofmateriality. When you become identified more with the timeless inner body thanwith the outer body, when presence becomes your normal mode of consciousness andpast and future no longer dominate your attention, you do not accumulate timeanymore in your psyche and in the cells of the body. The accumulation of time asthe psychological burden of past and future greatly impairs the cells' capacityfor self-renewal. So if you inhabit the inner body, the outer body will grow oldat a much slower rate, and even when it does, your timeless essence will shinethrough the outer form, and you will not give the appearance of an old person.Is there any scientific evidence for this?Try it out and you will be the evidence."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWSTRENGTHENING THE IMMUNE SYSTEMAnother benefit of this practice in the physical realm is a great strengtheningof the immune system which occurs when you inhabit the body. The moreconsciousness you bring into the body, the stronger the immune system becomes.It is as if every cell awakens and rejoices. The body loves your attention. Itis also a potent form of self- healing. Most illnesses creep in when you are notpresent in the body. If the master is not present in the house, all kinds ofshady characters will take up residence there. When you inhabit your body, itwill be hard for unwanted guests to enter.It is not only your physical immune system that becomes strengthened; yourpsychic immune system is greatly enhanced as well. The latter protects you fromthe negative mental-emotional force fields of others, which are highlycontagious. Inhabiting the body protects you not by putting up a shield, but byraising the frequency vibration of your total energy field, so that anythingthat vibrates at a lower frequency, such as fear, anger, depression, and so on,now exists in what is virtually a different order of reality. It doesnt enteryour field of consciousness anymore, or if it does you don't need to offer anyresistance to it because it passes right through you. Please don't just acceptor reject what I am saying. Put it to the test.There is a simple but powerful self-healing meditation that you can do wheneveryou feel the need to boost your immune system. It is particularly effective ifused when you feel the first symptoms of an illness, but it also works withillnesses that are already entrenched if you use it at frequent intervals andwith an intense focus. It will also counteract any disruption of your energyfield by some form of negativity. However, it is not a substitute for themoment-to- moment practice of being in the body;, otherwise, its effect willonly be temporary. Here it is.When you are unoccupied for a few minutes, and especially last thing at nightbefore falling asleep and first thing in the morning before getting up, “flood”your body with consciousness. Close your eyes. Lie flat on your back. Choosedifferent parts of your body to focus your attention on briefly at first: hands,feet, arms, legs, abdomen, chest, head, and so on. Feel the life energy insidethose parts as intensely as you can. Stay with each part for fifteen seconds orso. Then let your attention run through the body like a wave a few times, fromfeet to head and back again. This need only take a minute or so. After that,feel the inner body in its totality, as a single field of energy. Hold thatfeeling for a few minutes. Be intensely present during that time, present inevery cell of your body. Don't be concerned if the mind occasionally succeeds indrawing your attention out of the body and you lose yourself in some thought. Assoon as you notice that this has happened, just return your attention to theinner body."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWLET THE BREATH TAKE YOU INTO THE BODYAt times, when my mind has been very active, it has acquired such momentum thatI find it impossible to take my attention away from it and feel the inner body.This happens particularly when I get into a worry or anxiety pattern. Do youhave any suggestions?If at any time you are finding it hard to get in touch with the inner body, itis usually easier to focus on your breathing first. Conscious breathing, whichis a powerful meditation in its own right, will gradually put you in touch withthe body. Follow the breath with your attention as it moves in and out of yourbody. Breathe into the body, and feel your abdomen expanding and contractingslightly with each inhalation and exhalation. If you find it easy to visualize,close your eyes and see yourself surrounded by light or immersed in a luminoussubstance a sea of consciousness. Then breathe in that light.

Only if you are able to be conscious without thought can youuse your mind creatively, and the easiest way to enter that state is throughyour body. Whenever an answer, a solution, or a creative idea is needed, stopthinking for a moment by focusing attention on your inner energy field. Becomeaware of the stillness. When you resume thinking, it will be fresh and creative.In any thought activity, make it a habit to go back and forth every few minutesor so between thinking and an inner kind of listening,an inner stillness.

Feel the energy field of your inner body as you listen. Thattakes attention away from thinking and creates a still space that enables you totruly listen without the mind interfering. You are giving the other person spacespace to be. It is the most precious gift you can give. Most people don't knowhow to listen because the major part of their attention is taken up by thinking.They pay more attention to that than to what the other person is saying, andnone at all to what really matters: the Being of the other person underneath thewords and the mind. Of course, you cannot feel someone else's Being exceptthrough your own. This is the beginning of the realization of oneness, which islove. At the deepest level of Being, you are one with all that is.Most human relationships consist mainly of minds interacting with each other,not of human beings communicating, being in communion. No relationship canthrive in that way, and that is why there is so much conflict in relationships.When the mind is running your life, conflict, strife and problems areinevitable.

Make it intoa meditation. It needn't take long. Ten to fifteen minutes of clock time shouldbe sufficient. Make sure first that there are no external distractions such astelephones or people who are likely to interrupt you. Sit on a chair, but don'tlean back. Keep the spine erect. Doing so will help you to stay alert.Alternatively, choose your own favorite position for meditation.Make sure the body is relaxed. Close your eyes. Take a few deep breaths. Feelyourself breathing into the lower abdomen, as it were. Observe how it expandsand contracts slightly with each in and out breath. Then become aware of theentire inner energy field of the body. Don't think about it feel it. By doingthis, you reclaim consciousness from the mind. If you find it helpful, use the“light” visualization I described earlier.When you can feel the inner body clearly as a single field of energy, let go, ifpossible, of any visual image and focus exclusively on the feeling. If you can,also drop any mental image you may still have of the physical body. All that isleft then is an all-encompassing sense of presence or “beingness,” and the innerbody is felt to be without a boundary. Then take your attention even more deeplyinto that feeling. Become one with it. Merge with the energy field, so thatthere is no longer a perceived duality of the observer and the observed, of youand your body. The distinction between inner and outer also dissolves now, sothere is no inner body anymore. By going deeply into the body, you havetranscended the body. Stay in this realm of pure Being for as long as feelscomfortable; then become aware again of the physical body, your breathing andphysical senses, and open your eyes. Look at your surroundings for a few minutesin a meditative way that is, without labeling them mentally and continue to feelthe inner body as you do so.¤Having access to that formless realm is truly liberating. It frees you frombondage to form and identification with form. It is life in its undifferentiatedstate prior to its fragmentation into multiplicity. We may call it theUnmanifested, the invisible Source of all things, the Being within all beings.It is a realm of deep stillness and peace, but also of joy and intensealiveness. Whenever you are present, you become “transparent” to some extent tothe light, the pure consciousness that emanates from this Source. You alsorealize that the light is not separate from who you are but constitutes yourvery essence."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWTHE SOURCE OF CHIIs the Unmanifested what in the East is called chi, a kind of universal lifeenergy?No, it isn't. The Unmanifested is the source of chi. Chi is the inner energy,field of your body. It is the bridge between the outer you and the Source. Itlies halfway between the manifested, the world of form, and the Unmanifested.Chi can be likened to a river or an energy stream. If you take the focus of yourconsciousness deeply into the inner body, you are tracing the course of thisriver back to its Source. Chi is movement; the Unmanifested is stillness. Whenyou reach a point of absolute stillness, which is nevertheless vibrant withlife, you have gone beyond the inner body and beyond chi to the Source itself:the Unmanifested. Chi is the link between the Unmanifested and the physicaluniverse.So if you take your attention deeply into the inner body, you may reach thispoint, this singularity, where the world dissolves into the Unmanifested and theUnmanifested takes on form as the energy stream of chi, which then becomes theworld. This is the point of birth and death. When your consciousness is directedoutward, mind and world arise. When it is directed inward, it realizes its ownSource and returns home into the Unmanifested. Then, when your consciousnesscomes back to the manifested world, you reassume the form identity that youtemporarily relinquished. You have a name, a past, a life situation, a future.But in one essential respect, you are not the same person you were before: Youwill have glimpsed a reality within yourself that is not “of this world,”although it isnt separate from it, just as it isn't separate from you.Now let your spiritual practice be this: As you go about your life, don't give1oo percent of your attention to the external world and to your mind. Keep somewithin. I have spoken about this already. Feel tile inner body even when engagedin everyday activities, especially when engaged in relationships or when you arerelating with nature. Feel the stillness deep inside it. Keep the portal open.It is quite possible to be conscious of the Unmanifested throughout your life.You feel it as a deep sense of peace somewhere in the background, a stillnessthat never leaves you, no matter what happens out here. You become a bridgebetween the Unmanifested and the manifested, between God and the world. This isthe state of connectedness with the Source that we call enlightenment.Dont get the impression that the Unmanifested is separate from the manifested.How could it be? It is the life within every form, the inner essence of all thatexists. It pervades this world. Let me explain."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWDREAMLESS SLEEPYou take a journey into the Unmanifested every night when you enter the phase ofdeep dreamless sleep. You merge with the Source. You draw from it the vitalenergy that sustains you for a while when you return to the manifested, theworld of separate forms. This energy is much more vital than food: “Man does notlive by bread alone.” But in dreamless sleep, you don't go into it consciously.Although the bodily functions are still operating, “you” no longer exist in thatstate. Can you imagine what it would be like to go into dreamless sleep withfull consciousness? It is impossible to imagine it, because that state has nocontent.The Unmanifested does not liberate you until you enter it consciously. Thats whyJesus did not say:. the truth will make you free, but rather: “You will know thetruth, and the truth will make you free.” This is not a conceptual truth. It isthe truth of eternal life beyond form, which is known directly or not at all.But don't attempt to stay conscious in dreamless sleep. It is highly unlikelythat you will succeed. At most, you may remain conscious during the dream phase,but not beyond that. This is called lucid dreaming, which may be interesting andfascinating, but it is not liberating.So use your inner body as a portal through which you 134 enter the Unmanifested,and keep that portal open so that you stay connected with the Source at alltimes. It makes no difference, as far as the inner body is concerned, whetheryour outer physical body is old or young, frail or strong. The inner body istimeless. If you are not yet able to feel the inner body, use one of the otherportals, although ultimately they are all one. Some I have spoken about atlength already, but I'll mention them again briefly here."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWOTHER PORTALSThe Now can be seen as the main portal. It is an essential aspect of every otherportal, including the inner body. You cannot be in your body without beingintensely present in the Now.Time and the manifested are as inextricably linked as are the timeless Now andthe Unmanifested. When you dissolve psychological time through intensepresent-moment awareness, you become conscious of the Unmanifested both directlyand indirectly. Directly, you feel it as the radiance and power of yourconscious presence no content, just presence. Indirectly, you are aware of theUnmanifested in and through the sensory realm. In other words, you feel theGod-essence in every creature, every flower, every stone, and you realize: 'Allthat is, is holy.“ This is why Jesus, speaking entirely from his essence orChrist identity, says in the Gospel of Thomas: ”Split a piece of wood; I amthere. Lift up a stone, and you will find me there.\"Another portal into the Unmanifested is created through the cessation ofthinking. This can start with a very simple thing, such as taking one consciousbreath or looking, in a state of intense alertness, at a flower, so that thereis no mental commentary running at the same time. There are many ways to createa gap in the incessant stream of thought. This is what meditation is all about.Thought is part of the realm of the manifested. Continuous mind activity keepsyou imprisoned in the world of form and becomes an opaque screen that preventsyou from becoming conscious of the Unmanifested, conscious of the formless andtimeless God- essence in yourself and in all things and all creatures. When youare intensely present, you don't need to be concerned about the cessation ofthinking, of course, because the mind then stops automatically. Thats why I saidthe Now is an essential aspect of every other portal.Surrender the letting go of mental-emotional resistance to what is also becomesa portal into the Unmanifested. The reason for this is simple: inner resistancecuts you off from other people, from yourself, from the world around you. Itstrengthens the feeling of separateness on which the ego depends for itssurvival. The stronger the feeling of separateness, the more you are bound tothe manifested, to the world of separate forms. The more you are bound to theworld of form, the harder and more impenetrable your form identity becomes. Theportal is closed, and you are cut off from the inner dimension, the dimension ofdepth. In the state of surrender, your form identity softens and becomessomewhat “transparent,” as it were, so the Unmanifested can shine through you.Its up to you to open a portal in your life that gives you conscious access tothe Unmanifested. Get in touch with the energy field of the inner body, beintensely present, disidentify from the mind, surrender to what is; these areall portals you can use but you only need to use one.Surely love must also be one of those portals?No, it isn't. As soon as one of the portals is open, love is present in you asthe “feeling-realization” of oneness. Love isn't a portal; ifs what comesthrough the portal into this world. As long as you are completely trapped inyour form identity, there can be no love. Your task is not to search for lovebut to find a portal through which love can enter."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWSILENCEAre there any other portals apart from those you just mentioned?Yes, there are. The Unmanifested is not separate from the manifested. Itpervades this world, but it is so well disguised that almost everybody misses itcompletely. If you know where to look, you'll find it everywhere. A portal opensup every moment.Do you hear that dog barking in the distance? Or that car passing by? Listencarefully. Can you feel the presence of the Unmanifested in that? You cant? Lookfor it in the silence out of which the sounds come and into which they return.Pay more attention to the silence than to the sounds. Paying attention to outersilence creates inner silence: the mind becomes still. A portal is opening up.Every sound is born out of silence, dies back into silence, and during its lifespan is surrounded by silence. Silence enables the sound to be. It is anintrinsic but unmanifested part 0fevery sound, every musical note, every song,every word. The Unmanifested is present in this world as silence. This is why ithas been said that nothing in this world is so like God as silence. All you haveto do is pay attention to it. Even during a conversation, become conscious ofthe gaps between words, the brief silent intervals between sentences. As you dothat, the dimension of stillness grows within you. You cannot pay attention tosilence without simultaneously becoming still within. Silence without, stillnesswithin. You have entered the Unmanifested."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWSPACEJust as no sound can exist without silence, nothing can exist without nothing,without the empty space that enables it to be. Every physical object or body hascome out of nothing, is surrounded by nothing, and will eventually return tonothing. Not only that, but even inside every physical body there is far more“nothing” than “something.” Physicists tell us that the solidity of matter is anillusion. Even seemingly solid matter, including your physical body, is nearly100 percent empty space so vast are the distances between the atoms compared totheir size. What is more, even inside every atom there is mostly empty space.What is left is more like a vibrational frequency than particles of solidmatter, more like a musical note. Buddhists have known that for over 2,500years. “Form is emptiness, emptiness is form,” states the Heart Sutra, one ofthe best known ancient Buddhist texts. The essence of all things is emptiness.The Unmanifested is not only present in this world as silence; it also pervadesthe entire physical universe as space from within and without. This is just aseasy to miss as silence. Everybody pays attention to the things in space, butwho pays attention to space itself?You seem to be implying that “emptiness” or “nothing” is not just nothing, thatthere is some mysterious quality to it. What is this nothing?You cannot ask such a question. Your mind is trying to make nothing intosomething. The moment you make it into something, you have missed it. Nothingspace is the appearance of the Unmanifested as an externalized phenomenon in asense-perceived world. Thats about as much as one can say about it, and eventhat is a kind of paradox. It cannot become an object of knowledge. You can't doa Ph.D. on “nothing.” When scientists study space, they usually make it intosomething and thereby miss its essence entirely. Not surprisingly, the latesttheory is that space isn't empty at all, that it is filled with some substance.Once you have a theory, ifs not too hard to find evidence to substantiate it, atleast until some other theory comes along.“Nothing” can only become a portal into the Unmanifested for you if you don'ttry to grasp or understand it.Isn't that what we are doing here ?Not at all. I am giving you pointers to show you how you can bring the dimensionof the Unmanifested into your life. We are not trying to understand it. There isnothing to understand.Space has no “existence.” “To exist” literally means “to stand out.” You cannotunderstand space because it doesn't standout. Although in itself it has noexistence, it enables everything else to exist. Silence has no existence either,nor does the Unmanifested.So what happens if you withdraw attention from the objects in space and becomeaware of space itself.> What is the essence of this room? The furniture,pictures, and so on are in the room, but they are not the room. The floor,walls, and ceiling define the boundary of the room, but they are not the roomeither. So what is the essence of the room? Space, of course, empty space. Therewould be no “room” without it.Since space is “nothing,” we can say that what is not there is more importantthan what is there. So become aware of the space that is all around you. Don'tthink about it. Feel it, as it were. Pay attention to “nothing.”As you do that, a shift in consciousness takes place inside you. Here is why.The inner equivalent to objects in space such as furniture, walls, and so on areyour mind objects: thoughts, emotions, and the objects of the senses. And theinner equivalent of space is the consciousness that enables your mind objects tobe, just as space allows all things to be. So if you withdraw attention fromthings objects in space you automatically withdraw attention from your mindobjects as well. In other words: You cannot think and be aware of space or ofsilence, for that matter. By becoming aware of the empty space around you, yousimultaneously become aware of the space of no-mind, of pure consciousness: theUnmanifested. This is how the contemplation of space can become a portal foryou.Space and silence are two aspects of the same thing, the same nothing. They arean externalization of inner space and inner silence, which is stillness: theinfinitely creative womb of all existence. Most humans are completelyunconscious of this dimension. There is no inner space, no stillness. They areout of balance. In other words, they know the world, or think they do, but theydont know God. They identify exclusively with their own physical andpsychological form, unconscious of essence. And because every form is highlyunstable, they live in fear. This fear causes a deep misperception of themselvesand of other humans, a distortion in their vision of the world.If some cosmic convulsion brought about the end of our world, the Unmanifestedwould remain totally unaffected by this. A Course in Miracles expresses thistruth poignantly. “Nothing real can be threatened. Nothing unreal exists. Hereinlies the peace of God.”If you remain in conscious connection with the Unmanifested, you value, love,and deeply respect the manifested and every life form in it as an expression ofthe One Life beyond form. You also know that every form is destined to dissolveagain and that ultimately nothing out here matters all that much. You have“overcome the world,” in the words of Jesus, or, as the Buddha put it, you have“crossed over to the other shore.”"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWTHE TRUE NATURE OF SPACE AND TIMENow consider this: If there were nothing but silence, it wouldn't exist for you;you wouldn't know what it is. Only when sound appears does silence come intobeing. Similarly, if there were only space without any objects in space, itwouldn't exist for you. Imagine yourself as a point of consciousness floating inthe vastness of space no stars, no galaxies, just emptiness. Suddenly, spacewouldn't be vast anymore; it would not be there at all. There would be no speed,no movement from here to there. At least two points of reference are needed fordistance and space to come into being. Space comes into being the moment the Onebecomes two, and as “two” become the “ten thousand things,” as Lao Tse calls themanifested world, space becomes more and more vast. So world and space arisesimultaneously.Nothing could be without space, yet space is nothing. Before the universe cameinto being, before the “big bang” if you like, there wasn't a vast empty spacewaiting to be filled. There was no space, as there was no thing. There was onlythe Unmanifested the One. When the One became “the ten thousand things,”suddenly space seemed to be there and enabled the many to be. Where did it comefrom? Was it created by God to accommodate the universe? Of course not. Space isno-thing, so it was never created.Go out on a clear night and look up at the sky. The thousands of stars you cansee with the naked eye are no more than an infinitesimal fraction of what isthere. Over 100 billion galaxies can already be detected with the most powerfultelescopes, each galaxy an “island universe” with billions of stars. Yet what iseven more awe-inspiring is the infinity of space itself, the depth and stillnessthat allows all of that magnificence to be. Nothing could be more awe- inspiringand majestic than the inconceivable vastness and stillness of space, and yetwhat is it? Emptiness, vast emptiness.What appears to us as space in our universe perceived through the mind and thesenses is the Unmanifested itself, externalized. It is the “body” of God. Andthe greatest miracle is this: That stillness and vastness that enables theuniverse to be, is not just out there in space it is also within you. When youare utterly and totally present, you encounter it as the still inner space ofno-mind. Within you, it is vast in depth, not in extension. Spacial extension isultimately a misperception of infinite depth an attribute of the onetranscendental reality.According to Einstein, space and time are not separate. I don't reallyunderstand it, but I think he is saying that time is the fourth dimension ofspace. He calls it the “space-time continuum. ”Yes. What you perceive externally as space and time are ultimately illusory, butthey contain a core of truth. They are the two essential attributes of God,infinity and eternity, perceived as if they had an external existence outsideyou. Within you, both space and time have an inner equivalent that reveals theirtrue nature, as well as your own. Whereas space is the still, infinitely deeprealm of no-mind, the inner equivalent of time is presence, awareness of theeternal Now. Remember that there is no distinction between them. When space andtime are realized within as the Unmanifested no-mind and presence external spaceand time continue to exist for you, but they become much less important. Theworld, too, continues to exist for you, but it will not bind you anymore.Hence, the ultimate purpose of the world lies not within the world but intranscendence of the world. Just as you would not be conscious of space if therewere no objects in space, the world is needed for the Unmanifested to berealized. You may have heard the Buddhist saying: “If there were no illusion,there would be no enlightenment.” It is through the world and ultimately throughyou that the Unmanifested knows itself. You are here to enable the divinepurpose of the universe to unfold. That is how important you are!"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWCONSCIOUS DEATHApart from dreamless sleep, which I mentioned already, there is one otherinvoluntary portal. It opens up briefly at the time of physical death. Even ifyou have missed all the other opportunities for spiritual realization duringyour lifetime, one last portal will open up for you immediately after the bodyhas died.There are countless accounts by people who had a visual impression of thisportal as radiant light and then returned from what is commonly known as anear-death experience. Many of them also spoke of a sense of blissful serenityand deep peace. In the Tibetan Book of the Dead, it is described as “theluminous splendor of the colorless light of Emptiness,” which it says is “yourown true self.” This portal opens up only very briefly, and unless you havealready encountered the dimension of the Unmanifested in your lifetime, you willlikely miss it. Most people carry too much residual resistance, too much fear,too much attachment to sensory experience, too much identification with themanifested world. So they see the portal, turn away in fear, and then loseconsciousness. Most of what happens after that is involuntary and automatic.Eventually, there will be another round of birth and death. Their presencewasn't strong enough yet for conscious immortality. So going through this portaldoes not mean annihilation?As with all the other portals, your radiant true nature remains, but not thepersonality. In any case, whatever is real or of true value in your personalityis your true nature shining through. This is never lost. Nothing that is ofvalue, nothing that is real, is ever lost. Approaching death and death itself,the dissolution of the physical form, is always a great opportunity forspiritual realization. This opportunity is tragically missed most of the time,since we live in a culture that is almost totally ignorant of death, as it isalmost totally ignorant of anything that truly matters.Every portal is a portal of death, the death of the false self. When you gothrough it, you cease to derive your identity from your psychological, mind-madeform. You then realize that death is an illusion, just as your identificationwith form was an illusion. The end of illusion thats all that death is. It ispainful only as long as you ding to illusion."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOW"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHT"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWENLIGHTENED RELATIONSHIPS"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWENTER THE NOW FROM WHEREVER YOU AREI always thought that true enlightenment is not possible except through love ina relationship between a man and a woman. Isn't this what makes us whole again?How can one's life be fulfilled until that happens?Is that true in your experience? Has this happened to you?Not yet, but how could it be otherwise? I know that it will happen.In other words, you are waiting for an event in time to save you. Is this notthe core error that we have been talking about?Salvation is not elsewhere in place or time. It is here and now.What does that statement mean, “salvation is here and now”? I don't understandit. I don't even know what salvation means.Most people pursue physical pleasures or various forms of psychologicalgratification because they believe that those things will make them happy orfree them from a feeling of fear or lack. Happiness may be perceived as aheightened sense of aliveness attained through physical pleasure, or a moresecure and more complete sense of self attained through some form ofpsychological gratification. This is the search for salvation from a state ofunsatisfactoriness or insufficiency. Invariably, any satisfaction that theyobtain is short-lived, so the condition of satisfaction or fulfillment isusually projected once again onto an imaginary point away from the here and now.“When I obtain this or am free of that then I will be okay.” This is theunconscious mind-set that creates the illusion of salvation in the future.True salvation is fulfillment, peace, life in all its fullness. It is to be whoyou are, to feel within you the good that has no opposite, the joy of Being thatdepends on nothing outside itself. It is felt not as a passing experience but asan abiding presence. In theistic language, it is to “know God” not as somethingoutside you but as your own innermost essence. True salvation is to knowyourself as an inseparable part of the timeless and formless One Life from whichall that exists derives its being. True salvation is a state of freedom fromfear, from suffering, from a perceived state of lack and insufficiency andtherefore from all wanting, needing, grasping, and dinging. It is freedom fromcompulsive thinking, from negativity, and above all from past and future as apsychological need. Your mind is telling you that you cannot get there fromhere. Something needs to happen, or you need to become this or that before youcan be free and fulfilled. It is saying, in fact, that you need time that youneed to find, sort out, do, achieve, acquire, become, or understand somethingbefore you can be free or complete. You see time as the means to salvation,whereas in truth it is the greatest obstacle to salvation. You think that youcan't get there from where and who you are at this moment because you are notyet complete or good enough, but the truth is that here and now is the onlypoint from where you can get there. You \"get' there by realizing that you arethere already. You find God the moment you realize that you don't need to seekGod. So there is no only way to salvation: Any condition can be used, but noparticular condition is needed. However, there is only one point of access: theNow: There can be no salvation away from this moment. You are lonely and withouta partner? Enter the Now from there. You are in a relationship? Enter the Nowfrom there.There is nothing you can ever do or attain that will get you closer to salvationthan it is at this moment. This may be hard to grasp for a mind accustomed tothinking that everything worthwhile is in the future. Nor can anything that youever did or that was done to you in the past prevent you from saying yes to whatis and taking your attention deeply into the Now. You cannot do this in thefuture. You do it now or not at all.¤"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWLOVE/HATE RELATIONSHIPSUnless and until you access the consciousness frequency of presence, allrelationships, and particularly intimate relationships, are deeply flawed andultimately dysfunctional.They may seem perfect for a while, such as when you are “in love,” butinvariably that apparent perfection gets disrupted as arguments, conflicts,dissatisfaction, and emotional or even physical violence occur with increasingfrequency. It seems that most “love relationships” become love/haterelationships before long. Love can then turn into savage attack, feelings ofhostility, or complete withdrawal of affection at the flick of a switch. This isconsidered normal. The relationship then oscillates for a while, a few months ora few years, between the polarities of “love” and hate, and it gives you as muchpleasure as it gives you pain. It is not uncommon for couples to become addictedto those cycles. Their drama makes them feel alive. When a balance between thepositive/negative polarities is lost and the negative, destructive cycles occurwith increasing frequency and intensity, which tends to happen sooner or later,then it will not be long before the relationship finally collapses.It may appear that if you could only eliminate the negative or destructivecycles, then all would be well and the relationship would flower beautifully butalas, this is not possible. The polarities are mutually interdependent. Youcannot have one without the other. The positive already contains within itselfthe as yet unmanifested negative. Both are in fact different aspects of the samedysfunction. I am speaking here of what is commonly called romanticrelationships not of true love, which has no opposite because it arises frombeyond the mind. Love as a continuous state is as yet very rare as rare asconscious human beings. Brief and elusive glimpses of love, however, arepossible whenever there is a gap in the stream of mind.The negative side of a relationship is, of course, more easily recognizable asdysfunctional than the positive one. And it is also easier to recognize thesource of negativity in your partner than to see it in yourself. It can manifestin many forms: possessiveness, jealousy, control, withdrawal and unspokenresentment, the need to be right, insensitivity and self-absorption, emotionaldemands and manipulation, the urge to argue, criticize, judge, blame, or attack,anger, unconscious revenge for past pain inflicted by a parent, rage andphysical violence.On the positive side, you are “in love” with your partner. This is at first adeeply satisfying state. You feel intensely alive. Your existence has suddenlybecome meaningful because someone needs you, wants you, and makes you feelspecial, and you do the same for him or her. When you are together, you feelwhole. The feeling can become so intense that the rest of the world fades intoinsignificance. However, you may also have noticed that there is a neediness anda clinging quality to that intensity. You become addicted to the other person.He or she acts on you like a drug. You are on a high when the drug is available,but even the possibility or the thought that he or she might no longer be therefor you can lead to jealousy, possessiveness, attempts at manipulation throughemotional blackmail, blaming and accusing fear of loss. If the other person doesleave you, this can give rise to the most intense hostility or the most profoundgrief and despair. In an instant, loving tenderness can turn into a savageattack or dreadful grief. Where is the love now? Can love change into itsopposite in an instant? Was it love in the first place, or just an addictivegrasping and clinging?"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWADDICTION AND THE SEARCH FOR WHOLENESSWhy should we become addicted to another person?The reason why the romantic love relationship is such an intense and universallysought-after experience is that it seems to offer liberation from a deep-seatedstate of fear, need, lack, and incompleteness that is part of the humancondition in its unredeemed and unenlightened state. There is a physical as wellas a psychological dimension to this state.On the physical level, you are obviously not whole, nor will you ever be: Youare either a man or a woman, which is to say, one-half of the whole. On thislevel, the longing for wholeness the return to oneness manifests as male- femaleattraction, man's need for a woman, woman's need for a man. It is an almostirresistible urge for union with the opposite energy polarity. The root of thisphysical urge is a spiritual one: the longing for an end to duality, a return tothe state of wholeness. Sexual union is the closest you can get to this state onthe physical level. This is why it is the most deeply satisfying experience thephysical realm can offer. But sexual union is no more than a fleeting glimpse ofwholeness, an instant of bliss. As long as it is unconsciously sought as a meansof salvation, you are seeking the end of duality on the level of form, where itcannot be found. You are given a tantalizing glimpse of heaven, but you are notallowed to dwell there, and find yourself again in a separate body.On the psychological level, the sense of lack and incompleteness is, ifanything, even greater than on the physical level. As long as you are identifiedwith the mind, you have an externally derived sense of self. That is to say, youget your sense of who you are from things that ultimately have nothing to dowith who you are: your social role, possessions, external appearance, successesand failures,belief systems, and so on. This false, mind-made self, the ego, feelsvulnerable, insecure, and is always seeking new things to identify with to giveit a feeling that it exists. But nothing is ever enough to give it lastingfulfillment. Its fear remains; its sense of lack and neediness remains.But then that special relationship comes along. It seems to be the answer to allthe ego's problems and to meet all its needs. At least this is how it appears atfirst. All the other things that you derived your sense of self from before, nowbecome relatively insignificant. You now have a single focal point that replacesthem all, gives meaning to your life, and through which you define youridentity: the person you are “in love” with. You are no longer a disconnectedfragment in an uncaring universe, or so it seems. Your world now has a center:the loved one. The fact that the center is outside you and that, therefore, youstill have an externally derived sense of self does not seem to matter at first.What matters is that the underlying feelings of incompleteness, of fear, lackand unfulfillment so characteristic of the egoic state are no longer there orare they? Have they dissolved, or do they continue to exist underneath the happysurface reality?If in your relationships you experience both “love” and the opposite of loveattack, emotional violence, and so on then it is likely that you are confusingego attachment and addictive clinging with love. You cannot love your partnerone moment and attack him or her the next. True love has no opposite. If your“love” has an opposite, then it is not love but a strong ego-need for a morecomplete and deeper sense of self, a need that the other person temporarilymeets. It is the ego's substitute for salvation, and for a short time it almostdoes feel like salvation.But there comes a point when your partner behaves in ways that fail to meet yourneeds, or rather those of your ego. The feelings of fear, pain, and lack thatare an intrinsic part of egoic consciousness but had been covered up by the“love relationship” now resurface. Just as with every other addiction, you areon a high when the drug is available, but invariably there comes a time when thedrug no longer works for you. When those painful feelings reappear, you feelthem even more strongly than before, and what is more, you now perceive yourpartner as the cause of those feelings. This means that you project them outwardand attack the other with all the savage violence that is part of your pain.This attack may awaken the partner's own pain, and he or she may counter yourattack. At this point, the ego is still unconsciously hoping that its attack orits attempts at manipulation will be sufficient punishment to induce yourpartner to change their behavior, so that it can use them again as a cover-upfor your pain.Every addiction arises from an unconscious refusal to face and move through yourown pain. Every addiction starts with pain and ends with pain. Whatever thesubstance you are addicted to alcohol, food, legal or illegal drugs, or a personyou are using something or somebody to cover up your pain. That is why, afterthe initial euphoria has passed, there is so much unhappiness, so much pain inintimate relationships. They do not cause pain and unhappiness. They bring outthe pain and unhappiness that is already in you. Every addiction does that.Every addiction reaches a point where it does not work for you anymore, and thenyou feel the pain more intensely than ever. This is one reason why most peopleare always trying to escape from the present moment and are seeking some kind ofsalvation in the future, The first thing that they might encounter if theyfocused their attention on the Now is their own pain, and this is what theyfear. If they only knew how easy it is to access in the Now the power ofpresence that dissolves the past and its pain, the reality that dissolves theillusion. If they only knew how close they are to their own reality, how dose toGod.Avoidance of relationships in an attempt to avoid pain is not the answer either.The pain is there anyway. Three failed relationships in as many years are morelikely to force you into awakening than three years on a desert island or shutaway in your room. But if you could bring intense presence into your aloneness,that would work for you too.¤"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWFROM ADDICTIVE TO ENLIGHTENED RELATIONSHIPSCan we change an addictive relationship into a true one ?Yes. Being present and intensifying your presence by taking your attention evermore deeply into the Now:. Whether you are living alone or with a partner, thisremains the key. For love to flourish, the light of your presence needs to bestrong enough so that you no longer get taken over by the thinker or thepain-body and mistake them for who you are. To know yourself as the Beingunderneath the thinker, the stillness underneath the mental noise, the love andjoy underneath the pain, is freedom, salvation, enlightenment. To disidentifyfrom the pain-body is to bring presence into the pain and thus transmute it. Todisidentify from thinking is to be the silent watcher of your thoughts andbehavior, especially the repetitive patterns of your mind and the roles playedby the ego.If you stop investing it with “selfness,” the mind loses its compulsive quality,which basically is the compulsion to judge, and so to resist what is, whichcreates conflict, drama, and new pain. In fact, the moment that judgment stopsthrough acceptance of what is, you are free of the mind. You have made room forlove, for joy, for peace. First you stop judging yourself; then you stop judgingyour partner. The greatest catalyst for change in a relationship is completeacceptance of your partner as he or she is, without needing to judge or changethem in any way. That immediately takes you beyond ego. All mind games and alladdictive clinging are then over. There are no victims and no perpetratorsanymore, no accuser and accused. This is also the end of all codependency, ofbeing drawn into somebody else's unconscious pattern and thereby enabling it tocontinue. You will then either separate in love or move ever more deeply intothe Now together into Being. Can it be that simple? Yes, it is that simple.Love is a state of Being. Your love is not outside; it is deep within you. Youcan never lose it, and it cannot leave you. It is not dependent on some otherbody, some external form. In the stillness of your presence, you can feel yourown formless and timeless reality as the unmanifested life that animates yourphysical form. You can then feel the same life deep within every other human andevery other creature. You look beyond the veil of form and separation. This isthe realization of oneness. This is love.What is God? The eternal One Life underneath all the forms of life. What islove? To feel the presence of that One Life deep within yourself and within allcreatures. To be it. Therefore, all love is the love of God. ¤Love is not selective, just as the light of the sun is not selective. It doesnot make one person special. It is not exclusive. Exclusivity is not the love ofGod but the “love” of ego. However, the intensity with which true love is feltcan vary. There may be one person who reflects your love back to you moreclearly and more intensely than others, and if that person feels the same towardyou, it can be said that you are in a love relationship with him or her. Thebond that connects you with that person is the same bond that connects you withthe person sitting next to you on a bus, or with a bird, a tree, a flower. Onlythe degree of intensity with which it is felt differs.Even in an otherwise addictive relationship, there may be moments when somethingmore real shines through, something beyond your mutual addictive needs. Theseare moments when both your and your partner's mind briefly subside and thepain-body is temporarily in a dormant state. This may sometimes happen duringphysical intimacy, or when you are both witnessing the miracle of childbirth, orin the presence of death, or when one of you is seriously ill anything thatrenders the mind powerless. When this happens,your Being, which is usually buried underneath the mind, becomes revealed, andit is this that makes true communication possible.True communication is communion the realization of oneness, which is love.Usually, this is quickly lost again, unless you are able to stay present enoughto keep out the mind and its old patterns. As soon as the mind and mindidentification return, you are no longer yourself but a mental image ofyourself, and you start playing games and roles again to get your ego needs met.You are a human mind again, pretending to be a human being, interacting withanother mind, playing a drama called “love.” Although brief glimpses arepossible, love cannot flourish unless you are permanently free of mindidentification and your presence is intense enough to have dissolved thepain-body or you can at least remain present as the watcher. The pain-bodycannot then take you over and so become destructive of love."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWRELATIONSHIPS AS SPIRITUAL PRACTICEAs the egoic mode of consciousness and all the social, political, and economicstructures that it created enter the final stage of collapse, the relationshipsbetween men and women reflect the deep state of crisis in which humanity nowfinds itself. As humans have become increasingly identified with their mind,most relationships are not rooted in Being and so turn into a source of pain andbecome dominated by problems and conflict.Millions are now living alone or as single parents, unable to establish anintimate relationship or unwilling to repeat the insane drama of pastrelationships. Others go from one relationship to another, from onepleasure-and-pain cycle to another, in search of the elusive goal of fulfillmentthrough union with the opposite energy polarity. Still others compromise andcontinue to be together in a dysfunctional relationship in which negativityprevails, for the sake of the children or security, through force of habit, fearof being alone, or some other mutually “beneficial” arrangement, or even throughthe unconscious addiction to the excitement of emotional drama and pain.However, every crisis represents not only danger but also opportunity. Ifrelationships energize and magnify egoic mind patterns and activate thepain-body, as they do at this time, why not accept this fact rather than try toescape from it? Why not cooperate with it instead of avoiding relationships orcontinuing to pursue the phantom of an ideal partner as an answer to yourproblems or a means of felling fulfilled? The opportunity that is concealedwithin every crisis does not manifest until all the facts of any given situationare acknowledged and fully accepted. As long as you deny them, as long as youtry to escape from them or wish that things were different, the window ofopportunity does not open up, and you remain trapped inside that situation,which will remain the same or deteriorate further.With the acknowledgment and acceptance of the facts also comes a degree offreedom from them. For example, when you know there is disharmony and you holdthat “knowing,” through your knowing a new factor has come in, and thedisharmony cannot remain unchanged. When you know you are not at peace, yourknowing creates a still space that surrounds your nonpeace in a loving andtender embrace and then transmutes your nonpeace into peace. As far as innertransformation is concerned, there is nothing you can do about it. You cannottransform yourself, and you certainly cannot transform your partner or anybodyelse. All you can do is create a space for transformation to happen, for graceand love to enter.¤So whenever your relationship is not working, whenever it brings out the“madness” in you and in your partner, be glad. What was unconscious is beingbrought up to the light. It is an opportunity for salvation. Every moment, holdthe knowing of that moment, particularly of your inner state. If there is anger,know that there is anger. If there is jealousy, defensiveness, the urge toargue, the need to be right, an inner child demanding love and attention, oremotional pain of any kind whatever it is, know the reality of that moment andhold the knowing. The relationship then becomes your sadhana, your spiritualpractice. If you observe unconscious behavior in your partner, hold it in theloving embrace of your knowing so that you won't react. Unconsciousness andknowing cannot coexist for long even if the knowing is only in the other personand not in the one who is acting out the unconsciousness. The energy form thatlies behind hostility and attack finds the presence of love absolutelyintolerable. If you react at all to your partner's unconsciousness, you becomeunconscious yourself. But if you then remember to know your reaction, nothing islost.Humanity is under great pressure to evolve because it is our only chance ofsurvival as a race. This will affect every aspect of your life and closerelationships in particular. Never before have relationships been as problematicand conflict ridden as they are now. As you may have noticed, they are not hereto make you happy or fulfilled. If you continue to pursue the goal of salvationthrough a relationship, you will be disillusioned again and again. But if youaccept that the relationship is here to make you conscious instead of happy,then the relationship will offer you salvation, and you will be aligningyourself with the higher consciousness that wants to be born into this world.For those who hold on to the old patterns, there will be increasing pain,violence, confusion, and madness.I suppose that it takes two to make a relationship into a spiritual practice, asyou suggest. For example, my partner is still acting out his old patterns ofjealousy and control. I have pointed this out many times, but he is unable tosee it.How many people does it take to make your life into a spiritual practice? Nevermind if your partner will not cooperate. Sanity consciousness can only come intothis world through you. You do not need to wait for the world to become sane, orfor somebody else to become conscious, before you can be enlightened. You maywait forever. Do not accuse each other of being unconscious. The moment youstart to argue, you have identified with a mental position and are now defendingnot only that position but also your sense of self. The ego is in charge. Youhave become unconscious. At times, it may be appropriate to point out certainaspects of your partner's behavior. If you are very alert, very present, you cando so without ego involvement without blaming, accusing, or making the otherwrong.When your partner behaves unconsciously, relinquish all judgment. Judgment iseither to confuse someone's unconscious behavior with who they are or to projectyour own unconsciousness onto another person and mistake that for who they are.To relinquish judgment does not mean that you do not recognize dysfunction andunconsciousness when you see it. It means “being the knowing” rather than “beingthe reaction” and the judge. You will then either be totally free of reaction oryou may react and still be the knowing, the space in which the reaction iswatched and allowed to be. Instead of fighting the darkness, you bring in thelight. Instead of reacting to delusion, you see the delusion yet at the sametime look through it. Being the knowing creates a clear space of loving presencethat allows all things and all people to be as they are. No greater catalyst fortransformation exists. If you practice this, your partner cannot stay with youand remain unconscious.If you both agree that the relationship will be your spiritual practice, so muchthe better. You can then express your thoughts and feelings to each other assoon as they occur, or as soon as a reaction comes up, so that you do not createa time gap in which an unexpressed or unacknowledged emotion or grievance canfester and grow. Learn to give expression to what you feel without blaming.Learn to listen to your partner in an open, nondefensive way. Give your partnerspace for expressing himself or herself. Be present. Accusing, defending,attacking all those patterns that are designed to strengthen or protect the egoor to get its needs met will then become redundant. Giving space to others andto yourself is vital. Love cannot flourish without it. When you have removed thetwo factors that are destructive of relationships: When the pain-body has beentransmuted and you are no longer identified with mind and mental positions, andif your partner has done the same, you will experience the bliss of theflowering of relationship. Instead of mirroring to each other your pain and yourunconsciousness, instead of satisfying your mutual addictive ego needs, you willreflect back to each other the love that you feel deep within, the love thatcomes with the realization of your oneness with all that is. This is the lovethat has no opposite.If your partner is still identified with the mind and the pain-body while youare already free, this will represent a major challenge not to you but to yourpartner. It is not easy to live with an enlightened person, or rather it is soeasy that the ego finds it extremely threatening. Remember that the ego needsproblems, conflict, and “enemies” to strengthen the sense of separateness onwhich its identity depends. The unenlightened partner's mind will be deeplyfrustrated because its fixed positions are not resisted, which means they willbecome shaky and weak, and there is even the “danger” that they may collapsealtogether, resulting in loss of self. The pain-body is demanding feedback andnot getting it. The need for argument, drama, and conflict is not being met. Butbeware: Some people who are unresponsive, withdrawn, insensitive, or cut offfrom their feelings may think and try to convince others that they areenlightened, or at least that there is “nothing wrong” with them and everythingwrong with their partner. Men tend to do that more than women. They may seetheir female partners as irrational or emotional. But if you can feel youremotions, you are not far from the radiant inner body just underneath. If youare mainly in your head, the distance is much greater, and you need to bringconsciousness into the emotional body before you can reach the inner body. Ifthere isn't an emanation of love and joy, complete presence and openness towardall beings, then it is not enlightenment. Another indicator is how a personbehaves in difficult or challenging situations or when things “go wrong.” Ifyour “enlightenment” is egoic self-delusion, then life will soon give you achallenge that will bring out your unconsciousness in whatever form as fear,anger, defensiveness, judgment, depression, and so on. If you are in arelationship, many of your challenges will come through your partner. Forexample, a woman may be challenged by an unresponsive male partner who livesalmost entirely in his head. She will be challenged by his inability to hearher, to give her attention and space to be, which is due to his lack ofpresence. The absence of love in the relationship, which is usually more keenlyfelt by a woman than a man, will trigger the woman's pain-body, and through itshe will attack her partner blame, criticize, make wrong, and so on. This inturn now becomes his challenge. To defend himself against her pain-body'sattack, which he sees as totally unwarranted, he will become even more deeplyentrenched in his mental positions as he justifies, defends himself orcounterattacks. Eventually, this may activate his own pain-body. When bothpartners have thus been taken over, a level of deep unconsciousness has beenreached, of emotional violence, savage attack and counterattack. It will notsubside until both pain-bodies have replenished themselves and then enter thedormant stage. Until the next time.This is only one of an endless number of possible scenarios. Many volumes havebeen written, and many more could be written, about the ways in whichunconsciousness is brought out in male-female relationships. But, as I saidearlier, once you understand the root of the dysfunction, you do not need toexplore its countless manifestations.Let's briefly look again at the scenario I have just described. Every challengethat it contains is actually a disguised opportunity for salvation. At everystage of the unfolding dysfunctional process, freedom from unconsciousness ispossible. For example, the woman's hostility could become a signal for the manto come out of his mind-identified state, awaken into the Now, become presentinstead of becoming even more identified with his mind, even more unconscious.Instead of “being” the pain- body, the woman could be the knowing that watchesthe emotional pain in herself, thus accessing the power of the Now andinitiating the transmutation of the pain. This would remove the compulsive andautomatic outward projection of it. She could then express her feelings to herpartner. There is no guarantee, of course, that he will listen, but it gives hima good chance to become present and certainly breaks the insane cycle of theinvoluntary acting out of old mind patterns. If the woman misses thatopportunity, the man could watch his own mental-emotional reaction to her pain,his own defensiveness, rather than being the reaction. He could then watch hisown pain-body being triggered and thus bring consciousness into his emotions. Inthis way, a clear and still space of pure awareness would come into being theknowing, the silent witness, the watcher. This awareness does not deny the painand yet is beyond it. It allows the pain to be and yet transmutes it at the sametime. It accepts everything and transforms everything. A door would have openedup for her through which she could easily join him in that space.If you are consistently or at least predominantly present in your relationship,this will be the greatest challenge for your partner. They will not be able totolerate your presence for very long and stay unconscious. If they are ready,they will walk through the door that you opened for them and join you in thatstate. If they are not, you will separate like oil and water. The light is toopainful for someone who wants to remain in darkness."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWWHY WOMEN ARE CLOSER TO ENLIGHTENMENTAre the obstacles to enlightenment the same for a man as for a woman?Yes, but the emphasis is different. Generally speaking, it is easier for a womanto feel and be in her body, so she is naturally closer to Being and potentiallycloser to enlightenment than a man. This is why many ancient culturesinstinctively chose female figures or analogies to represent or describe theformless and transcendental reality. It was often seen as a womb that givesbirth to everything in creation and sustains and nourishes it during its life asform. In the Tao Te Ching, one of the most ancient and profound books everwritten, the Tao, which could be translated as Being, is described as “infinite,eternally present, the mother of the universe.” Naturally, women are closer toit than men since they virtually “embody” the Unmanifested. What is more, allcreatures and all things must eventually return to the Source. 'All thingsvanish into the Tao. It alone endures.\" Since the Source is seen as female, thisis represented as the light and dark sides of the archetypal feminine inpsychology and mythology. The Goddess or Divine Mother has two aspects: Shegives life, and she takes life.When the mind took over and humans lost touch with the reality of their divineessence, they started to think of God as a male figure. Society became maledominated, and the female was made subordinate to the male.I am not suggesting a return to earlier female representations of the divine.Some people now use the term Goddess instead of God. They are redressing abalance between male and female that was lost a long time ago, and that is good.But it is still a representation and a concept, perhaps temporarily useful, justas a map or a signpost is temporarily useful, but more a hindrance than a helpwhen you are ready to realize the reality beyond all concepts and images. Whatdoes remain true, however, is that the energy frequency of the mind appears tobe essentially male. The mind resists, fights for control, uses, manipulates,attacks, tries to grasp and possess, and so on. This is why the traditional Godis a patriarchal, controlling authority figure, an often angry man who youshould live in fear of, as the Old Testament suggests. This God is a projectionof the human mind.To go beyond the mind and reconnect with the deeper reality of Being, verydifferent qualities are needed: surrender, nonjudgment, an openness that allowslife to be instead of resisting it, the capacity to hold all things in theloving embrace of your knowing. All these qualifies are much more closelyrelated to the female principle. Whereas mind-energy is hard and rigid,Being-energy is soft and yielding and yet infinitely more powerful than mind.The mind runs our civilization, whereas Being is in charge of all life on ourplanet and beyond. Being is the very Intelligence whose visible manifestation isthe physical universe. Although women are potentially closer to it, men can alsoaccess it within themselves.At this time, the vast majority of men as well as women are still in the grip ofthe mind: identified with the thinker and the pain-body. This, of course, iswhat prevents enlightenment and the flowering of love. As a general rule, themajor obstacle for men tends to be the thinking mind, and the major obstacle forwomen the pain-body, although in certain individual cases the opposite may betrue, and in others the two factors may be equal."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWDISSOLVING THE COLLECTIVE FEMALE PAIN-BODYWhy is the pain-body more of an obstacle for women?The pain-body usually has a collective as well as a personal aspect. Thepersonal aspect is the accumulated residue of emotional pain suffered in one'sown past. The collective one is the pain accumulated in the collective humanpsyche over thousands of years through disease, torture, war, murder, cruelty,madness, and so on. Everyone's personal pain-body also partakes of thiscollective pain-body. There are different strands in the collective pain-body.For example, certain races or countries in which extreme forms of strife andviolence occur have a heavier collective pain-body than others. Anyone with astrong pain-body and not enough consciousness to disidentify from it will notonly continuously or periodically be forced to relive their emotional pain butmay also easily become either the perpetrator or the victim of violence,depending on whether their pain-body is predominantly active or passive. On theother hand, they may also be potentially closer to enlightenment. This potentialisn't necessarily realized, of course, but if you are trapped in a nightmare youwill probably be more strongly motivated to awaken than someone who is justcaught in the ups and downs of an ordinary dream.Apart from her personal pain-body, every woman has her share in what could bedescribed as the collective female pain-body unless she is fully conscious. Thisconsists of accumulated pain suffered by women partly through male subjugationof the female, through slavery, exploitation, rape,childbirth, child loss, and so on, over thousands of years. The emotional orphysical pain that for many women precedes and coincides with the menstrual flowis the pain- body in its collective aspect that awakens from its dormancy atthat time, although it can be triggered at other times too. It restricts thefree flow of life energy through the body, of which menstruation is a physicalexpression. Let's dwell on this for a moment and see how it can become anopportunity for enlightenment. Often a woman is “taken over” by the pain-body atthat time. It has an extremely powerful energetic charge that can easily pullyou into unconscious identification with it. You are then actively possessed byan energy field that occupies your inner space and pretends to be you but, ofcourse, is not you at all. It speaks through you, acts through you, thinksthrough you. It will create negative situations in your life so that it can feedon the energy. It wants more pain, in whatever form. I have described thisprocess already. It can be vicious and destructive. It is pure pain, past painand it is not you.The number of women who are now approaching the fully conscious state alreadyexceeds that of men and will be growing even faster in the years to come. Menmay catch up with them in the end, but for some considerable time there will bea gap between the consciousness of men and that of women. Women are regainingthe function that is their birthright and, therefore, comes to them morenaturally than it does to men: to be a bridge between the manifested world andthe Unmanifested, between physicality and spirit. Your main task as a woman nowis to transmute the pain-body so that it no longer comes between you and yourtrue self, the essence of who you are. Of course, you also have to deal with theother obstacle to enlightenment, which is the thinking mind, but the intensepresence you generate when dealing with the pain-body will also free you fromidentification with the mind.The first thing to remember is this: As long as you make an identity foryourself out of the pain, you cannot become free of it. As long as part of yoursense of self is invested in your emotional pain, you will unconsciously resistor sabotage every attempt that you make to heal that pain. Why?Quite simply because you want to keep yourself intact, and the pain has becomean essential part of you. This is an unconscious process, and the only way toovercome it is to make it conscious. To suddenly see that you are or have beenattached to your pain can be quite a shocking realization. The moment yourealize this, you have broken the attachment. The pain- body is an energy field,almost like an entity, that has become temporarily lodged in your inner space.It is life energy that has become trapped, energy that is no longer flowing. Ofcourse, the pain-body is there because of certain things that happened in thepast. It/s the living past in you, and if you identify with it, you identifywith the past. A victim identity is the belief that the past is more powerfulthan the present, which is the opposite of the truth. It is the belief thatother people and what they did to you are responsible for who you are now, foryour emotional pain or your inability to be your true self. The truth is thatthe only power there is, is contained within this moment: It is the power ofyour presence. Once you know that, you also realize that you are responsible foryour inner space now nobody else is and that the past cannot prevail against thepower of the Now.¤So identification prevents you from dealing with the pain- body. Some women whoare already conscious enough to have relinquished their victim identity on thepersonal level are still holding on to a collective victim identity: “what mendid to women.” They are right and they are also wrong. They are right inasmuchas the collective female pain-body is in large part due to male violenceinflicted on women and repression of the female principle throughout the planetover millennia. They are wrong if they derive a sense of self from this fact andthereby keep themselves imprisoned in a collective victim identity. If a womanis still holding on to anger, resentment, or condemnation, she is holding on toher pain-body. This may give her a comforting sense of identity, of solidaritywith other women, but it is keeping her in bondage to the past and blocking fullaccess to her essence and true power. If women exclude themselves from men, thatfosters a sense of separation and therefore a strengthening of the ego. And thestronger the ego, the more distant you are from your true nature.So do not use the pain-body to give you an identity. Use it for enlightenmentinstead. Transmute it into consciousness. One of the best times for this isduring menses. I believe that, in the years to come, many women will enter thefully conscious state during that time. Usually, it is a time of unconsciousnessfor many women, as they are taken over by the collective female pain-body. Onceyou have reached a certain level of consciousness, however, you can reversethis, so instead of becoming unconscious you become more conscious. I havedescribed the basic process already, but let me take you through it again, thistime with special reference to the collective female pain-body.When you know that the menstrual flow is approaching, before you feel the firstsigns of what is commonly called premenstrual tension, the awakening of thecollective female pain-body, become very alert and inhabit your body as fully aspossible. When the first sign appears, you need to be alert enough to “catch” itbefore it takes you over. For example, the first sign may be a sudden strongirritation or a flash of anger, or it may be a purely physical symptom. Whateverit is, catch it before it can take over your thinking or behavior. This simplymeans putting the spotlight of your attention on it. If it is an emotion, feelthe strong energy charge behind it. Know that it is the pain-body. At the sametime, be the knowing; that is to say, be aware of your conscious presence andfeel its power. Any emotion that you take your presence into will quicklysubside and become transmuted. If it is a purely physical symptom, the attentionthat you give it will prevent it from turning into an emotion or a thought. Thencontinue to be alert and wait for the next sign of the pain- body. When itappears, catch it again in the same way as before.Later, when the pain-body has fully awakened from its dormant state, you mayexperience considerable turbulence in your inner space for a while, perhaps forseveral days. Whatever form this takes, stay present. Give it your completeattention. Watch the turbulence inside you. Know it is there. Hold the knowing,and be the knowing. Remember: do not let the pain-body use your mind and takeover your thinking. Watch it. Feel its energy directly, inside your body. As youknow, full attention means full acceptance.Through sustained attention and thus acceptance, there comes transmutation. Thepain-body becomes transformed into radiant consciousness, just as a piece ofwood, when placed in or near a fire, itself is transformed into fire.Menstruation will then become not only a joyful and fulfilling expression ofyour womanhood but also a sacred time of transmutation, when you give birth to anew consciousness. Your true nature then shines forth, both in its female aspectas the Goddess and in its transcendental aspect as the divine Being that you arebeyond male and female duality.If your male partner is conscious enough, he can help you with the practice Ihave just described by holding the frequency of intense presence particularly atthis time. If he stays present whenever you fall back into unconsciousidentification with the pain-body, which can and will happen at first, you willbe able to quickly rejoin him in that state. This means that whenever thepain-body temporarily takes over, whether during menses or at other times, yourpartner will not mistake it for who you are. Even if the pain-body attacks him,as it probably will, he will not react to it as if it were “you,” withdraw, orput up some kind of defense. He will hold the space of intense presence. Nothingelse is needed for transformation. At other times, you will be able to do thesame for him or help him reclaim consciousness from the mind by drawing hisattention into the here and now whenever he becomes identified with histhinking. In this way, a permanent energy field of a pure and high frequencywill arise between you. No illusion, no pain, no conflict, nothing that is notyou, and nothing that is not love can survive in it. This represents thefulfillment of the divine, transpersonal purpose of your relationship. Itbecomes a vortex of consciousness that will draw in many others.¤GIVE UP THE RELATIONSHIP WITH YOURSELFWhen one is fully conscious, would one still have a need for a relationship?Would a man still feel drawn to a woman? Would a woman still feel incompletewithout a man?Enlightened or not, you are either a man or a woman, so on the level of yourform identity you are not complete. You are one-half of the whole. Thisincompleteness is felt as male- female attraction, the pull toward the oppositeenergy polarity, no matter how conscious you are. But in that state of innerconnectedness, you feel this pull somewhere on the surface or periphery of yourlife. Anything that happens to you in that state feels somewhat like that. Thewhole world seems like waves or ripples on the surface or a vast and deep ocean.You are that ocean and, of course, you are also a ripple, but a ripple that hasrealized its true identity as the ocean, and compared to that vastness anddepth, the world of waves and ripples is not all that important.This does not mean that you don't relate deeply to other people or to yourpartner. In fact, you can relate deeply only if you are conscious of Being.Coming from Being, you are able to focus beyond the veil of form. In Being, maleand female are one. Your form may continue to have certain needs, but Being hasnone. It is already complete and whole. If those needs are met, that isbeautiful, but whether or not they are met makes no difference to your deepinner state. So it is perfectly possible for an enlightened person, if the needfor the male or female polarity is not met, to feel a sense of lack orincompleteness on the outer level of his or her being, yet at the same time betotally complete, fulfilled, and at peace within.In the quest for enlightenment, is being gay a help or a hindrance, or does itnot make any difference?As you approach adulthood, uncertainty about your sexuality followed by therealization that you are “different” from others may force you to disidentifyfrom socially conditioned patterns of thought and behavior. This willautomatically raise your level of consciousness above that of the unconsciousmajority, whose members unquestioningly take on board all inherited patterns. Inthat respect, being gay can be a help. Being an outsider to some extent, someonewho does not “fit in” with others or is rejected by them for whatever reason,makes life difficult, but it also places you at an advantage as far asenlightenment is concerned. It takes you out of unconsciousness almost by force.On the other hand, if you then develop a sense of identity based on yourgayness, you have escaped one trap only to fall into another. You will playroles and games dictated by a mental image you have of yourself as gay. You willbecome unconscious. You will become unreal. Underneath your ego mask, you willbecome very unhappy. If this happens to you, being gay will have become ahindrance. But you always get another chance, of course. Acute unhappiness canbe a great awakener.Is it not true that you need to have a good relationship with yourself and loveyourself before you can have a fulfilling relationship with another person ?If you cannot be at ease with yourself when you are alone, you will seek arelationship to cover up your unease. You can be sure that the unease will thenreappear in some other form within the relationship, and you will probably holdyour partner responsible for it.All you really need to do is accept this moment fully. You are then at ease inthe here and now and at ease with yourself.But do you need to have a relationship with yourself at all? Why can't you justbe yourself? When you have a relationship with yourself, you have split yourselfinto two: “I” and “myself,” subject and object. That mind-created duality is theroot cause of all unnecessary complexity, of all problems and conflict in yourlife. In the state of enlightenment, you are yourself “you” and “yourself” mergeinto one. You do not judge yourself, you do not feel sorry for yourself, you arenot proud of yourself, you do not love yourself, you do not hate yourself, andso on. The split caused by self-reflective consciousness is healed, its curseremoved. There is no “self” that you need to protect, defend, or feed anymore.When you are enlightened, there is one relationship that you no longer have: therelationship with yourself. Once you have given that up, all your otherrelationships will be love relationships."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOW"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINE"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWBEYOND HAPPINESS AND UNHAPPINESS THERE IS PEACE"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWTHE HIGHER GOOD BEYOND GOOD AND BADIs there a difference between happiness and inner peace?Yes. Happiness depends on conditions being perceived as positive; inner peacedoes not.Is it not possible to attract only positive conditions into our life? If ourattitude and our thinking are always positive, we would manifest only positiveevents and situations, wouldn't we?Do you truly know what is positive and what is negative? Do you have the totalpicture? There have been many people for whom limitation, failure, loss,illness, or pain in whatever form turned out to be their greatest teacher. Ittaught them to let go of false self-images and superficial ego-dictated goalsand desires. It gave them depth, humility, and compassion. It made them morereal.Whenever anything negative happens to you, there is a deep lesson concealedwithin it, although you may not see it at the time. Even a brief illness or anaccident can show you what is real and unreal in your life, what ultimatelymatters and what doesnt. Seen from a higher perspective, conditions are alwayspositive. To be more precise: they are neither positive nor negative. They areas they are. And when you live in complete acceptance of what is which is theonly sane way to live there is no “good” or “bad” in your life anymore. There isonly a higher good which includes the “bad.” Seen from the perspective of themind, however, there is good-bad, like-dislike, love-hate. Hence, in the Book ofGenesis, it is said that Adam and Eve were no longer allowed to dwell in“paradise” when they “ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.”This sounds to me like denial and self-deception. When something dreadfulhappens to me or someone close to me accident, illness, pain of some kind ordeath I can pretend that it isn't bad, but the fact remains that it is bad, sowhy deny it?You are not pretending anything. You are allowing it to be as it is, thats all.This “allowing to be” takes you beyond the mind with its resistance patternsthat create the positive- negative polarities. It is an essential aspect offorgiveness. Forgiveness of the present is even more important than forgivenessof the past. If you forgive every moment allow it to be as it is then there willbe no accumulation of resentment that needs to be forgiven at some later time.Remember that we are not talking about happiness here. For example, when a lovedone has just died, or you feel your own death approaching, you cannot be happy.It is impossible. But you can be at peace. There may be sadness and tears, butprovided that you have relinquished resistance, underneath the sadness you willfeel a deep serenity, a stillness, a sacred presence. This is the emanation ofBeing, this is inner peace, the good that has no opposite. What if it is asituation that I can do something about? How can I allow it to be and change itat the same time?Do what you have to do. In the meantime, accept what is. Since mind andresistance are synonymous, acceptance immediately frees you from mind dominanceand thus reconnects you with Being. As a result, the usual ego motivations for“doing” fear, greed, control, defending or feeding the false sense of self willcease to operate. An intelligence much greater than the mind is now in charge,and so a different quality of consciousness will flow into your doing.“Accept whatever comes to you woven in the pattern of your destiny, for whatcould more aptly fit your needs?” This was written 2,000 years ago by MarcusAurelius, one of those exceedingly rare humans who possessed worldly power aswell as wisdom.It seems that most people need to experience a great deal of suffering beforethey will relinquish resistance and accept before they will forgive. As soon asthey do, one of the greatest miracles happens: the awakening of Being-consciousness through what appears as evil, the transmutation of suffering intoinner peace. The ultimate effect of all the evil and suffering in the world isthat it will force humans into realizing who they are beyond name and form.Thus, what we perceive as evil from our limited perspective is actually part ofthe higher good that has no opposite. This, however, does not become true foryou except through forgiveness. Until that happens, evil has not been redeemedand therefore remains evil.Through forgiveness, which essentially means recognizing the insubstantiality ofthe past and allowing the present moment to be as it is, the miracle oftransformation happens not only within but also without. A silent space ofintense presence arises both in you and around you. Whoever or whatever entersthat field of consciousness will be affected by it, sometimes visibly andimmediately, sometimes at deeper levels with visible changes appearing at alater time. You dissolve discord, heal pain, dispel unconsciousness withoutdoing anything simply by being and holding that frequency of intense presence.¤"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWTHE END OF YOUR LIFE DRAMAIn that state of acceptance and inner peace, even though you may not call it“bad,' can anything still come into your life that would be called ”bad\" from aperspective of ordinary consciousness?Most of the so-called bad things that happen in people's lives are due tounconsciousness. They are self-created, or rather ego-created. I sometimes referto those things as “drama.” When you are fully conscious, drama does not comeinto your life anymore. Let me remind you briefly how the ego operates and howit creates drama.Ego is the unobserved mind that runs your life when you are not present as thewitnessing consciousness, the watcher. The ego perceives itself as a separatefragment in a hostile universe, with no real inner connection to any otherbeing, surrounded by other egos which it either sees as a potential threat orwhich it will attempt to use for its own ends. The basic ego patterns aredesigned to combat its own deep-seated fear and sense of lack. They areresistance, control, power, greed, defense, attack. Some of the ego's strategiesare extremely clever, yet they never truly solve any of its problems, simplybecause the ego itself is the problem.When egos come together, whether in personal relationships or in organizationsor institutions, “bad” things happen sooner or later: drama of one kind oranother, in the form of conflict, problems, power struggles, emotional orphysical violence, and so on. This includes collective evils such as war,genocide, and exploitation all due to massed unconsciousness. Furthermore, manytypes of illness are caused by the ego's continuous resistance, which createsrestrictions and blockages in the flow of energy through the body. When youreconnect with Being and are no longer run by your mind, you cease to createthose things. You do not create or participate in drama anymore.Whenever two or more egos come together, drama of one kind or another ensues.But even if you live totally alone, you still create your own drama. When youfeel sorry for yourself, thats drama. When you feel guilty or anxious, thatsdrama. When you let the past or future obscure the present, you are creatingtime, psychological time the stuff out of which drama is made. Whenever you arenot honoring the present moment by allowing it to be, you are creating drama.Most people are in love with their particular life drama.Their story is their identity. The ego runs their life. They have their wholesense of self invested in it. Even their usually unsuccessful search for ananswer, a solution, or for healing becomes part of it. What they fear and resistmost is the end of their drama. As long as they are their mind, what they fearand resist most is their own awakening.When you live in complete acceptance of what is, that is the end of all drama inyour life. Nobody can even have an argument with you, no matter how hard he orshe tries. You cannot have an argument with a fully conscious person. Anargument implies identification with your mind and a mental position, as well asresistance and reaction to the other person's position. The result is that thepolar opposites become mutually energized. These are the mechanics ofunconsciousness. You can still make your point clearly and firmly, but therewill be no reactive force behind it, no defense or attack. So it won't turn intodrama. When you are fully conscious, you cease to be in conflict. “No one who isat one with himself can even conceive of conflict,” states A Course in Miracles.This refers not only to conflict with other people but more fundamentally toconflict within you, which ceases when there is no longer any clash between thedemands and expectations of your mind and what is."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWIMPERMANENCE AND THE CYCLES OF LIFEHowever, as long as you are in the physical dimension and linked to thecollective human psyche, physical pain although rare is still possible. This isnot to be confused with suffering, with mental-emotional pain. All suffering isego-created and is due to resistance. Also, as long as you are in thisdimension, you are still subject to its cyclical nature and to the law ofimpermanence of all things, but you no longer perceive this as “bad” it just is.Through allowing the “isness” of all things, a deeper dimension underneath theplay of opposites reveals itself to you as an abiding presence, an unchangingdeep stillness, an uncaused joy beyond good and bad. This is the joy of Being,the peace of God.On the level of form, there is birth and death, creation and destruction, growthand dissolution, of seemingly separate forms. This is reflected everywhere: inthe life cycle of a star or a planet, a physical body, a tree, a flower; in therise and fall of nations, political systems, civilizations; and in theinevitable cycles of gain and loss in the life of an individual.There are cycles of success, when things come to you and thrive, and cycles offailure, when they wither or disintegrate and you have to let them go in orderto make room for new things to arise, or for transformation to happen. If youcling and resist at that point, it means you are refusing to go with the flow oflife, and you will suffer. It is not true that the up cycle is good and the downcycle bad, except in the mind's judgment. Growth is usually considered positive,but nothing can grow forever. If growth, of whatever kind, were to go on and on,it would eventually become monstrous and destructive. Dissolution is needed fornew growth to happen. One cannot exist without the other.The down cycle is absolutely essential for spiritual realization. You must havefailed deeply on some level or experienced some deep loss or pain to be drawn tothe spiritual dimension. Or perhaps your very success became empty andmeaningless and so turned out to be failure. Failure lies concealed in everysuccess, and success in every failure. In this world, which is to say on thelevel of form, everybody “fails” sooner or later, of course, and everyachievement eventually comes to naught. All forms are impermanent.You can still be active and enjoy manifesting and creating new forms andcircumstances, but you won't be identified with them. You do not need them togive you a sense of self. They are not your life only your life situation.Your physical energy is also subject to cycles. It cannot always be at a peak.There will be times of low as well as high energy. There will be periods whenyou are highly active and creative, but there may also be times when everythingseems stagnant, when it seems that you are not getting anywhere, not achievinganything. A cycle can last for anything from a few hours to a few years. Thereare large cycles and small cycles within these large ones. Many illnesses arecreated through fighting against the cycles of low energy, which are vital forregeneration. The compulsion to do, and the tendency to derive your sense ofself-worth and identity from external factors such as achievement, is aninevitable illusion as long as you are identified with the mind.This makes it hard or impossible for you to accept the low cycles and allow themto be. Thus, the intelligence of the organism may take over as a self-protectivemeasure and create an illness in order to force you to stop, so that thenecessary regeneration can take place.The cyclical nature of the universe is closely linked with the impermanence ofall things and situations. The Buddha made this a central part of his teaching.All conditions are highly unstable and in constant flux, or, as he put it,impermanence is a characteristic of every condition, every situation you willever encounter in your life. It will change, disappear, or no longer satisfyyou. Impermanence is also central to Jesus's teaching: “Do not lay up foryourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thievesbreak in and steal . . . .”As long as a condition is judged as “good” by your mind, whether it be arelationship, a possession, a social role, a place, or your physical body, themind attaches itself to it and identifies with it. It makes you happy, makes youfeel good about yourself, and it may become part of who you are or think youare. But nothing lasts in this dimension where moth and rust consume. Either itends or it changes, or it may undergo a polarity shift: The same condition thatwas good yesterday or last year has suddenly or gradually turned into bad. Thesame condition that made you happy, then makes you unhappy. The prosperity oftoday becomes the empty consumerism of tomorrow. The happy wedding and honeymoonbecome the unhappy divorce or the unhappy coexistence. Or a conditiondisappears, so its absence makes you unhappy. When a condition or situation thatthe mind as attached itself to and identified with changes or disappears, themind cannot accept it. It will cling to the disappearing condition and resistthe change. It is almost as if a limb were being torn off your body.We sometimes hear of people who have lost all their money or whose reputationhas been ruined committing suicide. Those are the extreme cases. Others,whenever a major loss of one kind or another occurs, just become deeply unhappyor make themselves ill. They cannot distinguish between their life and theirlife situation. I recently read about a famous actress who died in her eighties.As her beauty started to fade and became ravaged by old age, she grewdesperately unhappy and became a recluse. She, too, had identified with acondition: her external appearance. First, the condition gave her a happy senseof self, then an unhappy one. If she had been able to connect with the formlessand timeless life within, she could have watched and allowed the fading of herexternal form from a place of serenity and peace. Moreover, her external formwould have become increasingly transparent to the light shining through from herageless true nature, so her beauty would not really have faded but simply becometransformed into spiritual beauty. However, nobody told her that this ispossible. The most essential kind of knowledge is not yet widely accessible.¤The Buddha taught that even your happiness is dukkha a Pali word meaning“suffering” or “unsatisfactoriness.” It is inseparable from its opposite. Thismeans that your happiness and unhappiness are in fact one. Only the illusion oftime separates them.This is not being negative. It is simply recognizing the nature of things, sothat you don't pursue an illusion for the rest of your life. Nor is it sayingthat you should no longer appreciate pleasant or beautiful things or conditions.But to seek something through them that they cannot give an identity, a sense ofpermanency and fulfillment is a recipe for frustration and suffering. The wholeadvertising industry and consumer society would collapse if people becameenlightened and no longer sought to find their identity through things. The moreyou seek happiness in this way, the more it will elude you. Nothing out therewill ever satisfy you except temporarily and superficially, but you may need toexperience many disillusionments before you realize that truth. Things andconditions can give you pleasure, but they will also give you pain. Things andconditions can give you pleasure, but they cannot give you joy. Nothing can giveyou joy. Joy is uncaused and arises from within as the joy of Being. It is anessential part of the inner state of peace, the state that has been called thepeace of God. It is your natural state, not something that you need to work hardfor or struggle to attain.Many people never realize that there can be no “salvation” in anything they do,possess, or attain. Those who do realize it often become world-weary anddepressed: if nothing can give you true fulfillment, what is there left tostrive for, what is the point in anything? The Old Testament prophet must havearrived at such a realization when he wrote “I have seen everything that is doneunder the sun, and behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind. ” When youreach this point, you are one step away from despair and one step away fromenlightenment.A Buddhist monk once told me: “All I have learned in the twenty years that Ihave been a monk I can sum up in one sentence: All that arises passes away. ThisI know.” What he meant, of course, was this: I have learned to offer noresistance to what is; I have learned to allow the present moment to be and toaccept the impermanent nature of all things and conditions. Thus have I foundpeace.To offer no resistance to life is to be in a state of grace, ease, andlightness. This state is then no longer dependent upon things being in a certainway, good or bad. It seems almost paradoxical, yet when your inner dependency onform is gone, the general conditions of your life, the outer forms, tend toimprove greatly. Things, people, or conditions that you thought you needed foryour happiness now come to you with no struggle or effort on your part, and youare free to enjoy and appreciate them while they last. All those things, ofcourse, will still pass away, cycles will come and go, but with dependency gonethere is no fear of loss anymore. Life flows with ease.The happiness that is derived from some secondary source is never very deep. Itis only a pale reflection of the joy of Being, the vibrant peace that you findwithin as you enter the state of nonresistance. Being takes you beyond the polaropposites of the mind and frees you from dependency on form. Even if everythingwere to collapse and crumble all around you, you would still feel a deep innercore of peace. You may not be happy, but you will be at peace.¤"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWUSING AND RELINQUISHING NEGATIVITYAll inner resistance is experienced as negativity in one form or another. Allnegativity is resistance. In this context, the two words are almost synonymous.Negativity ranges from irritation or impatience to fierce anger, from adepressed mood or sullen resentment to suicidal despair. Sometimes theresistance triggers the emotional pain-body, in which case even a minorsituation may produce intense negativity, such as anger, depression, or deepgrief.The ego believes that through negativity it can manipulate reality and get whatit wants. It believes that through it, it can attract a desirable condition ordissolve an undesirable one. A Course in Miracles rightly points out that,whenever you are unhappy, there is the unconscious belief that the unhappiness“buys” you what you want. If “you” the mind did not believe that unhappinessworks, why would you create it? The fact is, of course, that negativity does notwork. Instead of attracting a desirable condition, it stops it from arising.Instead of dissolving an undesirable one,it keeps it in place. Its only “useful” function is that it 182 strengthens theego, and that is why the ego loves it. Once you have identified with some formof negativity, you do not want to let go, and on a deeply unconscious level, youdo not want positive change. It would threaten your identity as a depressed,angry, or hard-done-by person. You will then ignore, deny or sabotage thepositive in your life.This is a common phenomenon. It is also insane. Negativity is totally unnatural.It is a psychic pollutant, and there is a deep link between the poisoning anddestruction of nature and the vast negativity that has accumulated in thecollective human psyche. No other life form on the planet knows negativity, onlyhumans, just as no other life form violates and poisons the Earth that sustainsit.Have you ever seen an unhappy flower or a stressed oak tree? Have you comeacross a depressed dolphin, a frog that has a problem with self-esteem, a catthat cannot relax, or a bird that carries hatred and resentment? The onlyanimals that may occasionally experience something akin to negativity or showsigns of neurotic behavior are those that live in close contact with humans andso link into the human mind and its insanity. Watch any plant or animal and letit teach you acceptance of what is, surrender to the Now. Let it teach youBeing. Let it teach you integrity which means to be one, to be yourself, to bereal. Let it teach you how to live and how to die, and how not to make livingand dying into a problem.I have lived with several Zen masters all of them cats. Even ducks have taughtme important spiritual lessons. Just watching them is a meditation. Howpeacefully they float along, at ease with themselves, totally present in theNow, dignified and perfect as only a mindless creature can be. Occasionally,however, two ducks will get into a fight sometimes for no apparent reason, orbecause one duck has strayed into another's private space. The fight usuallylasts only for a few seconds, and then the ducks separate, swim off in oppositedirections, and vigorously flap their wings a few times. They then continue toswim on peacefully as if the fight had never happened. When I observed that forthe first time, I suddenly realized that by flapping their wings they werereleasing surplus energy, thus preventing it from becoming trapped in their bodyand turning into negativity. This is natural wisdom, and it is easy for thembecause they do not have a mind that keeps the past alive unnecessarily and thenbuilds an identity around it.Couldn't a negative emotion also contain an important message? For example, if Ioften feel depressed, it may be a signal that there is something wrong with mylife, and it may force me to look at my life situation and make some changes. SoI need to listen to what the emotion is telling me and not just dismiss it asnegative.Yes, recurring negative emotions do sometimes contain a message, as doillnesses. But any changes that you make, whether they have to do with yourwork, your relationships, or your surroundings, are ultimately only cosmeticunless they arise out of a change in your level of consciousness. And as far asthat is concerned, it can only mean one thing: becoming more present. When youhave reached a certain degree of presence, you don't need negativity anymore totell you what is needed in your life situation. But as long as negativity isthere, use it. Use it as a kind of signal that reminds you to be more present.How do we stop negativity from arising, and how do we get rid of it once it isthere?As I said, you stop it from arising by being fully present. But don't becomediscouraged. There are as yet few people on the planet who can sustain a stateof continuous presence, although some are getting dose to it. Soon, I believe,there will be many more. Whenever you notice that some form of negativity hasarisen within you, look on it not as a failure, but as a helpful signal that istelling you: “Wake up. Get out of your mind. Be present.”There is a novel by Aldous Huxley called Island, written in his later years whenhe became very interested in spiritual teachings. It tells the story of a manshipwrecked on a remote island cut off from the rest of the world. This islandcontains a unique civilization. The unusual thing about it is that itsinhabitants, unlike those of the rest of the world, are actually sane. The firstthing that the man notices are the colorful parrots perched in the trees, andthey seem to be constantly croaking the words “Attention. Here and Now.Attention. Here and Now.” We later learn that the islanders taught them thesewords in order to be reminded continuously to stay present.So whenever you feel negativity arising within you, whether caused by anexternal factor, a thought, or even nothing in particular that you are aware of,look on it as a voice saying “Attention. Here and Now. Wake up.” Even theslightest irritation is significant and needs to be acknowledged and looked at;otherwise, there will be a cumulative build-up of unobserved reactions. As Isaid before, you may be able to just drop it once you realize that you don'twant to have this energy field inside you and that it serves no purpose. Butthen make sure that you drop it completely. If you cannot drop it, just acceptthat it is there and take your attention into the feeling, as I pointed outearlier.As an alternative to dropping a negative reaction, you can make it disappear byimagining yourself becoming transparent to the external cause of the reaction. Irecommend that you practice it with little, even trivial, things first. Lets saythat you are sitting quietly at home. Suddenly, there is the penetrating soundof a car alarm from across the street. Irritation arises. What is the purpose ofthe irritation? None whatsoever. Why did you create it? You didn't. The minddid. It was totally automatic, totally unconscious. Why did the mind create it?Because it holds the unconscious belief that its resistance, which youexperience as negativity or unhappiness in some form, will somehow dissolve theundesirable condition. This, of course, is a delusion. The resistance that itcreates, the irritation or anger in this case, is far more disturbing than theoriginal cause that it is attempting to dissolve.All this can be transformed into spiritual practice. Feel yourself becomingtransparent, as it were, without the solidity of a material body. Now allow thenoise, or whatever causes a negative reaction, to pass right through you. It isno longer hitting a solid “wall” inside you. As I said, practice with littlethings first. The car alarm, the dog barking, the children screaming, thetraffic jam. Instead of having a wall of resistance inside you that getsconstantly and painfully hit by things that “should not be happening,” leteverything pass through you.Somebody says something to you that is rude or designed to hurt. Instead ofgoing into unconscious reaction and negativity, such as attack, defense, orwithdrawal, you let it pass right through you. Offer no resistance. It is as ifthere is nobody there to get hurt anymore. That is forgiveness. In this way, youbecome invulnerable. You can still tell that person that his or her behavior isunacceptable, if that is what you choose to do. But that person no longer hasthe power to control your inner state. You are then in your power not in someoneelse's, nor are you run by your mind. Whether it is a car alarm, a rude person,a flood, an earthquake, or the loss of all your possessions, the resistancemechanism is the same.I have been practicing meditation, I have been to workshops, I have read manybooks on spirituality, I try to be in a state of nonresistance but if you ask mewhether I have found true and lasting inner peace, my honest answer would haveto be “no. ” Why haven't I found it? What else can I do?You are still seeking outside, and you cannot get out of the seeking mode. Maybethe next workshop will have the answer, maybe that new technique. To you I wouldsay. Don't look for peace. Dont look for any other state than the one you are innow; otherwise, you will set up inner conflict and unconscious resistance.Forgive yourself for not being at peace. The moment you completely accept yournon- peace, your nonpeace becomes transmuted into peace. Anything you acceptfully will get you there, will take you into peace. This is the miracle ofsurrender.¤You may have heard the phrase “turn the other cheek,” which a great teacher ofenlightenment used 2,000 years ago. He was attempting to convey symbolically thesecret of nonresistance and nonreaction. In this statement, as in all hisothers, he was concerned only with your inner reality, not with the outerconduct of your life.Do you know the story of Banzan? Before he became a great Zen master, he spentmany years in the pursuit of enlightenment, but it eluded him. Then one day, ashe was walking in the marketplace, he overheard a conversation between a butcherand his customer. “Give me the best piece of meat you have,” said the customer.And the butcher replied, “Every piece of meat I have is the best. There is nopiece of meat here that is not the best.” Upon hearing this, Banzan becameenlightened.I can see you are waiting for some explanation. When you accept what is, everypiece of meat every moment is the best. That is enlightenment."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWTHE NATURE OF COMPASSIONHaving gone beyond the mind-made opposites, you become like a deep lake. Theouter situation of your life and whatever happens there, is the surface of thelake. Sometimes calm, sometimes windy and rough, according to the cycles andseasons. Deep down, however, the lake is always undisturbed. You are the wholelake, not just the surface, and you are in touch with your own depth, whichremains absolutely still. You don't resist change by mentally clinging to anysituation. Your inner peace does not depend on it. You abide in Beingunchanging, timeless, deathless and you are no longer dependent for fulfillmentor happiness on the outer world of constantly fluctuating forms. You can enjoythem, play with them, create new forms, appreciate the beauty of it all. Butthere will be no need to attach yourself to any of it.When you become this detached, does it not mean that you also become remote fromother human beings?On the contrary. As long as you are unaware of Being, the reality of otherhumans will elude you, because you have not found your own. Your mind will likeor dislike their form, which is not just their body but includes their mind aswell. True relationship becomes possible only when there is an awareness ofBeing. Coming from Being, you will perceive another person's body and mind asjust a screen, as it were, behind which you can feel their true reality, as youfeel yours.So, when confronted with someone else's suffering or unconscious behavior, youstay present and in touch with Being and are thus able to look beyond the formand feel the other person's radiant and pure Being through your own. At thelevel of Being, all suffering is recognized as an illusion. Suffering is due toidentification with form. Miracles of healing sometimes occur through thisrealization, by awakening Being-consciousness in others if they are ready.Is that what compassion is?Yes. Compassion is the awareness of a deep bond between yourself and allcreatures. But there are two sides to compassion, two sides to this bond. On theone hand, since you are still here as a physical body, you share thevulnerability and mortality of your physical form with every other human andwith every living being. Next time you say “I have nothing in common with thisperson,” remember that you have a great deal in common: A few years from now twoyears or seventy years, it doesnt make much difference both of you will havebecome rotting corpses, then piles of dust, then nothing at all. This is asobering and humbling realization that leaves little room for pride. Is this anegative thought? No, it is a fact. Why close your eyes to it? In that sense,there is total equality between you and every other creature.One of the most powerful spiritual practices is to meditate deeply on themortality of physical forms, including your own. This is called: Die before youdie. Go into it deeply. Your physical form is dissolving, is no more. Then amoment comes when all mind-forms or thoughts also die. Yet you are still therethe divine presence that you are. Radiant, fully awake. Nothing that was realever died, only names, forms, and illusions.¤ The realization of this deathless dimension, your true nature, is the otherside of compassion. On a deep feeling-level, you now recognize not only your ownimmortality but through your own that of every other creature as well. On thelevel of form, you share mortality and the precariousness of existence.On the level of Being, you share eternal, radiant life. These are the twoaspects of compassion. In compassion, the seemingly opposite feelings of sadnessand joy merge into one and become transmuted into a deep inner peace, This isthe peace of God. It is one of the most noble feelings that humans are capableof, and it has great healing and transformative power. But true compassion, as Ihave just described it, is as yet rare. To have deep empathy for the sufferingof another being certainly requires a high degree of consciousness butrepresents only one side of compassion. It is not complete. True compassion goesbeyond empathy or sympathy. It does not happen until sadness merges with joy,the joy of Being beyond form, the joy of eternal life."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWTOWARD A DIFFERENT ORDER OF REALITYI don't agree that the body needs to die. I am convinced that we can achievephysical immortality. We believe in death and thats why the body dies.The body does not die because you believe in death. The body exists, or seemsto, because you believe in death. Body and death are part of the same illusion,created by the egoic mode of consciousness, which has no awareness of the Sourceof life and sees itself as separate and constantly under threat. So it createsthe illusion that you are a body, a dense, physical vehicle that is constantlyunder threat. To perceive yourself as a vulnerable body that was born and alittle later dies thats the illusion. Body and death: one illusion. You cannothave one without the other. You want to keep one side of the illusion and getrid of the other, but that is impossible. Either you keep all of it or yourelinquish all of it.However, you cannot escape from the body, nor do you have to. The body is anincredible misperception of your true nature. But your true nature is concealedsomewhere within that illusion, not outside it, so the body is still the onlypoint of access to it.If you saw an angel but mistook it for a stone statue, all you would have to dois adjust your vision and look more closely at the “stone statue,” not startlooking somewhere else. You would then find that there never was a stone statue.If belief in death creates the body, why does an animal have a body? An animaldoesn't have an ego, and it doesn't believe in death . . . .But it still dies, or seems to. Remember that your perception of the world is areflection of your state of consciousness. You are not separate from it, andthere is no objective world out there. Every moment, your consciousness createsthe world that you inhabit. One of the greatest insights that has come out ofmodern physics is that of the unity between the observer and the observed: theperson conducting the experiment the observing consciousness cannot be separatedfrom the observed phenomena, and a different way of looking causes the observedphenomena to behave differently. If you believe,on a deep level, in separation and the struggle for survival, then you see thatbelief reflected all around you and your perceptions are governed by fear. Youinhabit a world of death and of bodies fighting, killing, and devouring eachother. Nothing is what it seems to be. The world that you create and see throughthe egoic mind may seem a very imperfect place, even a vale of tears. Butwhatever you perceive is only a kind of symbol, like an image in a dream. It ishow your consciousness interprets and interacts with the molecular energy danceof the universe. This energy is the raw material of so-called physical reality.You see it in terms of bodies and birth and death, or as a struggle forsurvival. An infinite number of completely different interpretations, completelydifferent worlds, is possible and, in fact, exists all depending on theperceiving consciousness. Every being is a focal point of consciousness, andevery such focal point creates its own world, although all those worlds areinterconnected. There is a human world, an ant world, a dolphin world, and soon. There are countless beings whose consciousness frequency is so differentfrom yours that you are probably unaware of their existence, as they are ofyours. Highly conscious beings who are aware of their connectedness with theSource and with each other would inhabit a world that to you would appear as aheavenly realm and yet all worlds are ultimately one.Our collective human world is largely created through the level of consciousnesswe call mind. Even within the collective human world there are vast differences,many different “sub-worlds,” depending on the perceivers or creators of theirrespective worlds. Since all worlds are interconnected, when collective humanconsciousness becomes transformed, nature and the animal kingdom will reflectthat transformation. Hence the statement in the Bible that in the coming age“The lion shall lie down with the lamb.” This points to the possibility of acompletely different order of reality.The world as it appears to us now is, as I said, largely a reflection of theegoic mind. Fear being an unavoidable consequence of egoic delusion, it is aworld dominated by fear. Just as the images in a dream are symbols of innerstates and feelings, so our collective reality is largely a symbolic expressionof fear and of the heavy layers of negativity that have accumulated in thecollective human psyche. We are not separate from our world, so when themajority of humans become free of egoic delusion, this inner change will affectall of creation. You will literally inhabit a new world. It is a shift inplanetary consciousness. The strange Buddhist saying that every tree and everyblade of grass will eventually become enlightened points to the same truth.According to St. Paul, the whole of creation is waiting for humans to becomeenlightened. That is how I interpret his saying that “The created universe iswaiting with eager expectation for God's sons to be revealed.” St. Paul goes onto say that all of creation will become redeemed through this: “Up to thepresent . . . the whole created universe in all its parts groans as if in thepangs of childbirth.”What is being born is a new consciousness and, as its inevitable reflection, anew world. This is also foretold in the New Testament Book of Revelation: “ThenI saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth hadpassed away.”But don't confuse cause and effect. Your primary task is not to seek salvationthrough creating a better world, but to awaken out of identification with form.You are then no longer bound to this world, this level of reality. You can feelyour roots in the Unmanifested and so are free of attachment to the manifestedworld. You can still enjoy the passing pleasures of this world, but there is nofear of loss anymore, so you don't need to cling to them. Although you can enjoysensory pleasures, the craving for sensory experience is gone,as is the constant search for fulfillment through psychological gratification,through feeding the ego. You are in touch with something infinitely greater thanany pleasure, greater than any manifested thing.In a way, you then don't need the world anymore. You don't even need it to bedifferent from the way it is.It is only at this point that you begin to make a real 193 contribution towardbringing about a better world, toward creating a different order of reality. Itis only at this point that you are able to feel true compassion and to helpothers at the level of cause. Only those who have transcended the world canbring about a better world.You may remember that we talked about the dual nature of true compassion, whichis awareness of a common bond of shared mortality and immortality. At this deeplevel, compassion becomes healing in the widest sense. In that state,your healing influence is primarily based not on doing but on being. Everybodyyou come in contact with will be touched by your presence and affected by thepeace that you emanate, whether they are conscious of it or not. When you arefully present and people around you manifest unconscious behavior, you won'tfeel the need to react to it, so you don't give it any reality. Your peace is sovast and deep that anything that is not peace disappears into it as if it hadnever existed. This breaks the karmic cycle of action and reaction. Animals,trees, flowers will feel your peace and respond to it. You teach through being,through demonstrating the peace of God. You become the “light of the world,” anemanation of pure consciousness, and so you eliminate suffering on the level ofcause. You eliminate unconsciousness from the world.¤This doesn't mean that you may not also teach through doing for example, bypointing out how to disidentify from the mind, recognize unconscious patternswithin oneself, and so on. But who you are is always a more vital teaching and amore powerful transformer of the world than what you say, and more essentialeven than what you do. Furthermore, to recognize the primacy of Being, and thuswork on the level of cause, does not exclude the possibility that yourcompassion may simultaneously manifest on the level of doing and of effect, byalleviating suffering whenever you come across it. When a hungry person asks youfor bread and you have some, you will give it. But as you give the bread, eventhough your interaction may only be very brief, what really matters is thismoment of shared Being, of which the bread is only a symbol. A deep healingtakes place within it. In that moment, there is no giver, no receiver.But there shouldn't be any hunger and starvation in the first place. How can wecreate a better world without tackling evils such as hunger and violence first?All evils are the effect of unconsciousness. You can alleviate the effects ofunconsciousness, but you cannot eliminate them unless you eliminate their cause.True change happens within, not without.If you feel called upon to alleviate suffering in the world, that is a verynoble thing to do, but remember not to focus exclusively on the outer;otherwise, you will encounter frustration and despair. Without a profound changein human consciousness, the world's suffering is a bottomless pit. So dont letyour compassion become one-sided. Empathy with someone else's pain or lack and adesire to help need to be balanced with a deeper realization of the eternalnature of all life and the ultimate illusion of all pain. Then let your peaceflow into whatever you do and you will be working on the levels of effect andcause simultaneously.This also applies if you are supporting a movement designed to stop deeplyunconscious humans from destroying themselves, each other, and the planet, orfrom continuing to inflict dreadful suffering on other sentient beings.Remember. Just as you cannot fight the darkness, so you cannot fightunconsciousness. If you try to do so, the polar opposites will becomestrengthened and more deeply entrenched. You will become identified with one ofthe polarities, you will create an “enemy,” and so be drawn into unconsciousnessyourself. Raise awareness by disseminating information, or at the most, practicepassive resistance. But make sure that you carry no resistance within, nohatred, no negativity. “Love your enemies,” said Jesus, which, of course,means “have no enemies.” Once you get involved in working on the level ofeffect,it is all too easy to lose yourself in it. Stay alert and very, very present.The causal level needs to remain your primary focus, the teaching ofenlightenment your main purpose, and peace your most precious gift to the world."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOW"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TEN"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWTHE MEANING OF SURRENDER"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWACCEPTANCE OF THE NOWYou mentioned “surrender” a few times. I don't like that idea. It soundssomewhat fatalistic. If we always accept the way things are, we are not going tomake any effort to improve them. It seems to me what progress is all about, bothin our personal lives and collectively, is not to accept the limitations of thepresent but to strive to go beyond them and create something better. If wehadn't done this, we would still be living in caves. How do you reconcilesurrender with changing things and getting things done?To some people, surrender may have negative connotations, implying defeat,giving up, failing to rise to the challenges of life, becoming lethargic, and soon. True surrender, however, is something entirely different. It does not meanto passively put up with whatever situation you find yourself in and to donothing about it. Nor does it mean to cease making plans or initiating positiveaction.Surrender is the simple but profound wisdom of yielding to rather than opposingthe flow of life. The only place where you can experience the flow of life isthe Now, so to surrender is to accept the present moment unconditionally andwithout reservation. It is to relinquish inner resistance to what is. Innerresistance is to say “no” to what is, through mental judgment and emotionalnegativity. It becomes particularly pronounced when things “go wrong,” whichmeans that there is a gap between the demands or rigid expectations of your mindand what is. That is the pain gap. If you have lived long enough, you will knowthat things “go wrong” quite often. It is precisely at those times thatsurrender needs to be practiced if you want to eliminate pain and sorrow fromyour life. Acceptance of What is immediately frees you from mind identificationand thus reconnects you with Being. Resistance is the mind.Surrender is a purely inner phenomenon. It does not mean that on the outer levelyou cannot take action and change the situation. In fact, it is not the overallsituation that you need to accept when you surrender, but just the tiny segmentcalled the Now.For example, if you were stuck in the mud somewhere, you wouldn't say. “Okay, Iresign myself to being stuck in the mud.” Resignation is not surrender. Youdon't need to accept an undesirable or unpleasant life situation. Nor do youneed to deceive yourself and say that there is nothing wrong with being stuck inthe mud. No. You recognize fully that you want to get out of it. You then narrowyour attention down to the present moment without mentally labeling it in anyway. This means that there is no judgment of the Now. Therefore, there is noresistance, no emotional negativity. You accept the “isness” of this moment.Then you take action and do all that you can to get out of the mud. Such actionI call positive action. It is far more effective than negative action, whicharises out of anger, despair, or frustration. Until you achieve the desiredresult, you continue to practice surrender by refraining from labeling the Now.Let me give you a visual analogy to illustrate the point I am making. You arewalking along a path at night, surrounded by a thick fog. But you have apowerful flashlight that cuts through the fog and creates a narrow, dear spacein front of you. The fog is your life situation, which includes past and future;the flashlight is your conscious presence; the dear space is the Now.Non-surrender hardens your psychological form, the shell of the ego, and socreates a strong sense of separateness. The world around you and people inparticular come to be perceived as threatening. The unconscious compulsion to198 destroy others through judgment arises, as does the need to compete anddominate. Even nature becomes your enemy and your perceptions andinterpretations are governed by fear.The mental disease that we call paranoia is only a slightly more acute form ofthis normal but dysfunctional state of consciousness.Not only your psychological form but also your physical form your body becomeshard and rigid through resistance. Tension arises in different parts of thebody, and the body as a whole contracts. The free flow of life energy throughthe body, which is essential for its healthy functioning, is greatly restricted.Bodywork and certain forms of physical therapy can be helpful in restoring thisflow, but unless you practice surrender in your everyday life, those things canonly give temporary symptom relief since the cause the resistance pattern hasnot been dissolved.There is something within you that remains unaffected by the transientcircumstances that make up your life situation, and only through surrender doyou have access to it.It is your life, your very Being which exists eternally in the timeless realm ofthe present. Finding this life is “the one thing that is needed” that Jesustalked about.¤If you find your life situation unsatisfactory or even intolerable, it is onlyby surrendering first that you can break the unconscious resistance pattern thatperpetuates that situation.Surrender is perfectly compatible with taking action, initiating change orachieving goals. But in the surrendered state a totally different energy, adifferent quality, flows into your doing. Surrender reconnects you with thesource-energy of Being, and if your doing is infused with Being, it becomes ajoyful celebration of life energy that takes you more deeply into the Now.Through nonresistance, the quality of your consciousness and, therefore, thequality of whatever you are doing or creating is enhanced immeasurably. Theresults will then look after themselves and reflect that quality. We could callthis “surrendered action.” It is not work as we have known it for thousands ofyears. As more humans awaken, the word work is going to disappear from ourvocabulary, and perhaps a new word will be created to replace it.It is the quality of your consciousness at this moment that is the maindeterminant of what kind of future you will experience, so to surrender is themost important thing you can do to bring about positive change. Any action youtake is secondary. No truly positive action can arise out of an unsurrenderedstate of consciousness.I can see that if I am in a situation that is unpleasant or unsatisfactory and Icompletely accept the moment as it is, there will be no suffering orunhappiness. I will have risen above it. But I still can't quite see where theenergy or motivation for taking action and bringing about change would come fromif there isn't a certain amount of dissatisfaction.In the state of surrender, you see very clearly what needs to be done, and youtake action, doing one thing at a time and focusing on one thing at a time.Learn from nature: See how everything gets accomplished and how the miracle oflife unfolds without dissatisfaction or unhappiness. Thats why Jesus said: “Lookat the lilies, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin.”If your overall situation is unsatisfactory or unpleasant, separate out thisinstant and surrender to what is. Thats the flashlight cutting through the fog.Your state of consciousness then ceases to be controlled by external conditions.You are no longer coming from reaction and resistance. Then look at thespecifics of the situation. Ask yourself,“Is there anything I can do to change the situation, improve it, or removemyself from it?” If so, you take appropriate action. Focus not on the 100 thingsthat you will or may have to do at some future time but on the one thing thatyou can do now. This doesn't mean you should not do any planning. It may well bethat planning is the one thing you can do now. But make sure you don't start torun “mental movies,” project yourself into the future, and so lose the Now. Anyaction you take may not bear fruit immediately. Until it does do not resist whatis. If there is no action you can take, and you cannot remove yourself from thesituation either, then use the situation to make you go more deeply intosurrender, more deeply into the Now, more deeply into Being. When you enter thistimeless dimension of the present, change often comes about in strange wayswithout the need for a great deal of doing on your part. Life becomes helpfuland cooperative. If inner factors such as fear, guilt, or inertia prevented youfrom taking action, they will dissolve in the light of your conscious presence.Do not confuse surrender with an attitude of “I can't be bothered anymore” or “Ijust don't care anymore.” If you look at it closely, you will find that such anattitude is tainted with negativity in the form of hidden resentment and so isnot surrender at all but masked resistance. As you surrender, direct yourattention inward to check if there is any trace of resistance left inside you.Be very alert when you do so; otherwise, a pocket of resistance may continue tohide in some dark corner in the form of a thought or an unacknowledged emotion."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWFROM MIND ENERGY TO SPIRITUAL ENERGYLetting go of resistance is easier said than done. I still don't see clearly howto let go. If you say it is by surrendering, the question remains: “How?”Start by acknowledging that there is resistance. Be there when it happens, whenthe resistance arises. Observe how your mind creates it, how it labels thesituation, yourself, or others. Look at the thought process involved. Feel theenergy of the emotion. By witnessing the resistance, you will see that it servesno purpose. By focusing all your attention on the Now, the unconsciousresistance is made conscious, and that is the end of it. You cannot be consciousand unhappy, conscious and in negativity. Negativity, unhappiness, or sufferingin whatever form means that there is resistance, and resistance is alwaysunconscious.Surely I can be conscious of my unhappy feelings?Would you choose unhappiness? If you did not choose it, how did it arise? Whatis its purpose? Who is keeping it alive?You say that you are conscious of your unhappy feelings, but the truth is thatyou are identified with them and keep the process alive through compulsivethinking. All that is unconscious. If you were conscious, that is to say totallypresent in the Now, all negativity would dissolve almost instantly. It could notsurvive in your presence. It can only survive in your absence. Even thepain-body cannot survive for long in your presence. You keep your unhappinessalive by giving it time. That is its lifeblood. Remove time through intensepresent-moment awareness and it dies. But do you want it to die? Have you trulyhad enough? Who would you be without it?Until you practice surrender, the spiritual dimension is something you readabout, talk about, get excited about, write books about, think about, believe inor don't, as the case may be. It makes no difference. Not until you surrenderdoes it become a living reality in your life. When you do, the energy that youemanate and which then runs your life is of a much higher vibrational frequencythan the mind energy that still runs our world the energy that created theexisting social, political, and economic structures of our civilization, andwhich also continuously perpetuates itself through our educational systems andthe media. Through surrender, spiritual energy comes into this world. It createsno suffering for yourself, for other humans, or any other life form on theplanet. Unlike mind energy, it does not pollute the earth, and it is not subjectto the law of polarities, which dictates that nothing can exist without itsopposite, that there can be no good without bad. Those who run on mind energy,which is still the vast majority of the Earth's population, remain unaware ofthe existence of spiritual energy. It belongs to a different order of realityand will create a different world when a sufficient number of humans enter thesurrendered state and so become totally free of negativity. If the Earth is tosurvive, this will be the energy of those who inhabit it.Jesus referred to this energy when he made his famous prophetic statement in theSermon on the Mount: “Blessed are the gentle; they shall have the earth fortheir possession.” It is a silent but intense presence that dissolves theunconscious patterns of the mind. They may still remain active for a while, butthey won't run your life anymore. The external conditions that were beingresisted also tend to shift or dissolve quickly through surrender. It is apowerful transformer of situations and people. If conditions do not shiftimmediately, your acceptance of the Now enables you to rise above them. Eitherway, you are free."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWSURRENDER IN PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPSWhat about people who want to use me, manipulate or control me? Am I tosurrender to them?They are cut off from Being, so they unconsciously attempt to get energy andpower from you. It is true that only an unconscious person will try to use ormanipulate others, but it is equally true that only an unconscious person can beused and manipulated. If you resist or fight unconscious behavior in others, youbecome unconscious yourself. But surrender doesn't mean that you allow yourselfto be used by unconscious people. Not at all. It is perfectly possible to say“no” firmly and clearly to a person or to walk away from a situation and be in astate of complete inner nonresistance at the same time. When you say “no” to aperson or a situation, let it come not from reaction but from insight, from aclear realization of what is right or not right for you at that moment. Let itbe a nonreactive “no,” a high-quality “no,” a “no” that is free of allnegativity and so creates no further suffering.I am in a situation at work that is unpleasant. I have tried to surrender to it,but I find it impossible. A lot of resistance keeps coming up.If you cannot surrender, take action immediately. Speak up or do something tobring about a change in the situation or remove yourself from it. Takeresponsibility for your life. Do not pollute your beautiful, radiant inner Beingnor the Earth with negativity. Do not give unhappiness in any form whatsoever adwelling place inside you.If you cannot take action, for example if you are in prison, then you have twochoices left: resistance or surrender. Bondage or inner freedom from externalconditions. Suffering or inner peace. Is nonresistance also to be practiced inthe external conduct of our lives, such as nonresistance to violence, or is itsomething that just concerns our inner life?You only need to be concerned with the inner aspect. That is primary. Of course,that will also transform the conduct of your outer life, your relationships, andso on.Your relationships will be changed profoundly by surrender. If you can neveraccept what is, by implication you will not be able to accept anybody the waythey are. You will judge, criticize, label, reject, or attempt to change people.Furthermore, if you continuously make the Now into a means to an end in thefuture, you will also make every person you encounter or relate with into ameans to an end. The relationship the human being is then of secondaryimportance to you, or of no importance at all. What you can get out of therelationship is primary be it material gain, a sense of power, physicalpleasure, or some form of ego gratification.Let me illustrate how surrender can work in relationships. When you becomeinvolved in an argument or some conflict situation, perhaps with a partner orsomeone close to you, start by observing how defensive you become as your ownposition is attacked, or feel the force of your own aggression as you attack theother person's position. Observe the attachment to your views and opinions. Feelthe mental-emotional energy behind your need to be right and make the otherperson wrong. Thats the energy of the egoic mind. You make it conscious byacknowledging it, by feeling it as fully as possible. Then one day, in themiddle of an argument, you will suddenly realize that you have a choice, and youmay decide to drop your own reaction just to see what happens. You surrender. Idon't mean dropping the reaction just verbally by saying “Okay, you are right,”with a look on your face that says, “I am above all this childishunconsciousness.” Thats just displacing the resistance to another level, withthe egoic mind still in charge, claiming superiority. I am speaking of lettinggo of the entire mental-emotional energy field inside you that was fighting forpower. The ego is cunning, so you have to be very alert, very present, andtotally honest with yourself to see whether you have truly relinquished youridentification with a mental position and so freed yourself from your mind. Ifyou suddenly feel very light, clear and deeply at peace, that is an unmistakablesign that you have truly surrendered. Then observe what happens to the otherperson's mental position as you no longer energize it through resistance. Whenidentification with mental positions is out of the way, true communicationbegins.What about nonresistance in the face of violence, aggression, and the like?Nonresistance doesn't necessarily mean doing nothing. All it means is that any“doing” becomes nonreactive. Remember the deep wisdom underlying the practice ofEastern martial arts: don't resist the opponents force. Yield to overcome.Having said that, “doing nothing” when you are in a state of intense presence isa very powerful transformer and healer of situations and people. In Taoism,there is a term called wu wei, which is usually translated as “actionlessactivity” or “sitting quietly doing nothing.” In ancient China, this wasregarded as one of the highest achievements or virtues. It is radicallydifferent from inactivity in the ordinary state of consciousness, or ratherunconsciousness, which stems from fear, inertia, or indecision. The real “doingnothing” implies inner nonresistance and intense alertness.On the other hand, if action is required, you will no longer react from yourconditioned mind, but you will respond to the situation out of your consciouspresence. In that state, your mind is free of concepts, including the concept ofnonviolence. So who can predict what you will do? The ego believes that in yourresistance lies your strength, whereas in truth resistance cuts you off fromBeing, the only place of true power. Resistance is weakness and fearmasquerading as strength. What the ego sees as weakness is your Being in itspurity, innocence, and power. What it sees as strength is weakness. So the egoexists in a continuous resistance-mode and plays counterfeit roles to cover upyour “weakness,” which in truth is your power. Until there is surrender,unconscious role-playing constitutes a large part of human interaction. Insurrender, you no longer need ego defenses and false masks. You become verysimple, very real. “Thats dangerous,” says the ego. “You'll get hurt. You'llbecome vulnerable.” What the ego doesn't know, of course, is that only throughthe letting go of resistance, through becoming “vulnerable,” can you discoveryour true and essential invulnerability."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWTRANSFORMING ILLNESS INTO ENLIGHTENMENTIf someone is seriously ill and completely accepts their condition andsurrenders to the illness, would they not have given up their will to get backto health? The determination to fight the illness would not be there any more,would it?Surrender is inner acceptance of what is without any reservations. We aretalking about your life this instant not the conditions or circumstances of yourlife, not what I call your life situation. We have spoken about this already.With regard to illness, this is what it means. Illness is part of your lifesituation. As such, it has a past and a future. Past and future form anuninterrupted continuum, unless the redeeming power of the Now is activatedthrough your conscious presence. As you know, underneath the various conditionsthat make up your life situation, which exists in time, there is somethingdeeper, more essential: your Life, your very Being in the timeless Now.As there are no problems in the Now, there is no illness either. The belief in alabel that someone attaches to your condition keeps the condition in place,empowers it, and makes a seemingly solid reality out of a temporary imbalance.It gives it not only reality and solidity but also a continuity in time that itdid not have before. By focusing on this instant and refraining from labeling itmentally, illness is reduced to one or several of these factors: physical pain,weakness, discomfort, or disability. That is what you surrender to now. You donot surrender to the idea of “illness.” Allow the suffering to force you intothe present moment, into a state of intense conscious presence. Use it forenlightenment.Surrender does not transform what is, at least not directly. Surrendertransforms you. When you are transformed, your whole world is transformed,because the world is only a reflection. We spoke about this earlier.If you looked in the mirror and did not like what you saw, you would have to bemad to attack the image in the mirror. That is precisely what you do when youare in a state of nonacceptance. And, of course, if you attack the image, itattacks you back. If you accept the image, no matter what it is, if you becomefriendly toward it, it cannot not become friendly toward you. This is how youchange the world.Illness is not the problem. You are the problem as long as the egoic mind is incontrol. When you are ill or disabled, do not feel that you have failed in someway, do not feel guilty. Do not blame life for treating you unfairly, but do notblame yourself either. All that is resistance. If you have a major illness, useit for enlightenment. Anything “bad” that happens in your life use it forenlightenment. Withdraw time from the illness. Do not give it any past orfuture. Let it force you into intense present-moment awareness and see whathappens. Become an alchemist. Transmute base metal into gold,suffering into consciousness, disaster into enlightenment. Are you seriously illand feeling angry now about what I have just said? Then that is a clear signthat the illness has become part of your sense of self and that you are nowprotecting your identity as well as protecting the illness. The condition thatis labeled “illness” has nothing to do with who you truly are."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWWHEN DISASTER STRIKESAs far as the still unconscious majority of the population is concerned, only acritical limit-situation has the potential to crack the hard shell of the egoand force them into surrender and so into the awakened state. A limit-situationarises when through some disaster, drastic upheaval, deep loss, or sufferingyour whole world is shattered and doesn't make sense anymore. It is an encounterwith death, be it physical or psychological. The egoic mind, the creator of thisworld, collapses. Out of the ashes of the old world, a new world can then comeinto being.There is no guarantee, of course, that even a limit- situation will do it, butthe potential is always there. Some people's resistance to what is evenintensifies in such a situation, and so it becomes a descent into hell. Inothers, there may only be partial surrender, but even that will give them acertain depth and serenity that were not there before. Parts of the ego shellbreak off, and this allows small amounts of the radiance and peace that liebeyond the mind to shine through.Limit-situations have produced many miracles. There have been murderers in deathrow waiting for execution who, in the last few hours of their lives, experiencedthe egoless state and the deep joy and peace that come with it. The innerresistance to the situation they found themselves in became so intense as toproduce unbearable suffering, and there was nowhere to run and nothing to do toescape it, not even a mind-projected future. So they were forced into completeacceptance of the unacceptable. They were forced into surrender. In this way,they were able to enter the state of grace with which comes redemption: completerelease from the past. Of course, it is not really the limit-situation thatmakes room for the miracle of grace and redemption but the act of surrender.So whenever any kind of disaster strikes, or something goes seriously “wrong”illness, disability, loss of home or fortune or of a socially defined identity,break-up or a close relationship, death or suffering of a loved one, or your ownimpending death know that there is another side to it, that you are just onestep away from something incredible: a complete alchemical transmutation of thebase metal of pain and suffering into gold. That one step is called surrender.I do not mean to say that you will become happy in such a situation. You willnot. But fear and pain will become transmuted into an inner peace and serenitythat come from a very deep place from the Unmanifested itself. It is “the peaceof God, which passes all understanding.” Compared to that, happiness is quite ashallow thing. With this radiant peace comes the realization not on the level ofmind but within the depth of your Being that you are indestructible, immortal.This is not a belief. It is absolute certainty that needs no external evidenceor proof from some secondary source."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWTRANSFORMING SUFFERING INTO PEACEI read about a stoic philosopher in ancient Greece who, when he was told thathis son had died in an accident, replied, “I knew he was not immortal.” Is thatsurrender? If it is, I don't want it. There are some situations in whichsurrender seems unnatural and inhuman.Being cut off from your feelings is not surrender. But we don't know what hisinner state was when he said those words. In certain extreme situations, it maystill be impossible for you to accept the Now. But you always get a secondchance at surrender.Your first chance is to surrender each moment to the reality of that moment.Knowing that what is cannot be undone because it already is you say yes to whatis or accept what isn't. Then you do what you have to do, whatever the situationrequires. If you abide in this state of acceptance, you create no morenegativity, no more suffering,no more unhappiness. You then live in a state of nonresistance, a state of graceand lightness, free of struggle.Whenever you are unable to do that, whenever you miss that chance either becauseyou are not generating enough conscious presence to prevent some habitual andunconscious resistance pattern from arising, or because the condition is soextreme as to be absolutely unacceptable to you then you are creating some formof pain, some form of suffering. It may look as if the situation is creating thesuffering, but ultimately this is not so your resistance is.Now here is your second chance at surrender: If you cannot accept what isoutside, then accept what is inside. If you cannot accept the externalcondition, accept the internal condition. This means: Do not resist the pain.Allow it to be there. Surrender to the grief, despair, fear, loneliness, orwhatever form the suffering takes. Witness it without labeling it mentally.Embrace it. Then see how the miracle of surrender transmutes deep suffering intodeep peace. This is your crucifixion. Let it become your resurrection andascension. I do not see how one can surrender to suffering. As you yourselfpointed out, suffering is non-surrender. How could you surrender tonon-surrender?Forget about surrender for a moment. When your pain is deep, all talk ofsurrender will probably seem futile and meaningless anyway.When your pain is deep, you will likely have a strong urge to escape from itrather than surrender to it. You don't want to feel what you feel. What could bemore normal? But there is no escape, no way out. There are many pseudo escapeswork, drink, drugs, anger, projection, suppression,and so on but they don't free you from the pain. Suffering does not diminish inintensity when you make it unconscious. When you deny emotional pain, everythingyou do or think as well as your relationships become contaminated with it. Youbroadcast it, so to speak, as the energy you emanate, and others will pick it upsubliminally. If they are unconscious, they may even feel compelled to attack orhurt you in some way, or you may hurt them in an unconscious projection of yourpain. You attract and manifest whatever corresponds to your inner state. Whenthere is no way out, there is still always a way through. So don't turn awayfrom the pain. Face it. Feel it fully. Feel it don't think about it! Express itif necessary, but don't create a script in your mind around it. Give all yourattention to the feeling, not to the person, event, or situation that seems tohave caused it. Don't let the mind use the pain to create a victim identity foryourself out of it. Feeling sorry for yourself and telling others your storywill keep you stuck in suffering. Since it is impossible to get away from thefeeling, the only possibility of change is to move into it; otherwise, nothingwill shift. So give your complete attention to what you feel, and refrain frommentally labeling it. As you go into the feeling, be intensely alert. At first,it may seem like a dark and terrifying place, and when the urge to turn awayfrom it comes, observe it but don't act on it. Keep putting your attention onthe pain, keep feeling the grief, the fear, the dread, the loneliness, whateverit is. Stay alert, stay present present with your whole Being, with every cellof your body. As you do so, you are bringing a light into this darkness. This isthe flame of your consciousness.At this stage, you don't need to be concerned with surrender anymore. It hashappened already. How? Full attention is full acceptance, is surrender. Bygiving full attention, you use the power of the Now, which is the power of yourpresence. No hidden pocket of resistance can survive in it. Presence removestime. Without time, no suffering, no negativity, can survive.The acceptance of suffering is a journey into death. Facing deep pain, allowingit to be, taking your attention into it, is to enter death consciously. When youhave died this death, you realize that there is no death and there is nothing tofear. Only the ego dies. Imagine a ray of sunlight that has forgotten it is aninseparable part of the sun and deludes itself into believing it has to fightfor survival and create and cling to an identity other than the sun. Would thedeath of this delusion not be incredibly liberating?Do you want an easy death? Would you rather die without pain, without agony?Then die to the past every moment, and let the light of your presence shine awaythe heavy, time-bound self you thought of as “you.”"},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWTHE WAY OF THE CROSS¤¤ There are many accounts of people who say they have found God through theirdeep suffering, and there is the Christian expression “the way of the cross, ”which I suppose points to the same thing.We are concerned with nothing else here. Strictly speaking, they did not findGod through their suffering, because suffering implies resistance. They foundGod through surrender, through total acceptance of what is, into which they wereforced by their intense suffering. They must have realized on some level thattheir pain was self- created. How do you equate surrender with finding God?Since resistance is inseparable from the mind, relinquishment of resistancesurrender is the end of the mind as your master, the impostor pretending to be“you,” the false god. All judgment and all negativity dissolve. The realm ofBeing, which had been obscured by the mind, then opens up. Suddenly, a greatstillness arises within you, an unfathomable sense of peace. And within thatpeace, there is great joy. And within that joy, there is love. And at theinnermost core, there is the sacred, the immeasurable, That which cannot benamed.I don't call it finding God, because how can you find that which was never lost,the very life that you are? The word God is limiting not only because ofthousands of years of misperception and misuse, but also because it implies anentity other than you. God is Being itself, not a being. There can be nosubject-object relationship here, no duality, no you and God. God-realization isthe most natural thing there is. The amazing and incomprehensible fact is notthat you can become conscious of God but that you are not conscious of God.The way of the cross that you mentioned is the old way to enlightenment, anduntil recently it was the only way. But don't dismiss it or underestimate itsefficacy. It still works.The way of the cross is a complete reversal. It means that the worst thing inyour life, your cross, turns into the best thing that ever happened to you, byforcing you into surrender, into “death,” forcing you to become as nothing, tobecome as God because God, too, is no-thing.At this time, as far as the unconscious majority of humans is concerned, the wayof the cross is still the only way. They will only awaken through furthersuffering, and enlightenment as a collective phenomenon will be predictablypreceded by vast upheavals. This process reflects the workings of certainuniversal laws that govern the growth of consciousness and thus was foreseen bysome seers. It is described, among other places, in the Book of Revelation orApocalypse, though cloaked in obscure and sometimes impenetrable symbology. Thissuffering is inflicted not by God but by humans on themselves and on each otheras well as by certain defensive measures that the Earth, which is a living,intelligent organism, is going to take to protect herself from the onslaught ofhuman madness.However, there is a growing number of humans alive today whose consciousness issufficiently evolved not to need any more suffering before the realization ofenlightenment. You may be one of them.Enlightenment through suffering the way of the cross means to be forced into thekingdom of heaven kicking and screaming. You finally surrender because you can'tstand the pain anymore, but the pain could go on for a long time until thishappens. Enlightenment consciously chosen means to relinquish your attachment topast and future and to make the Now the main focus of your life. It meanschoosing to dwell in the state of presence rather than in time. It means sayingyes to what is. You then don't need pain anymore. How much more time do youthink you will need before you are able to say “I will create no more pain, nomore suffering?” How much more pain do you need before you can make that choice?If you think that you need more time, you will get more time and more pain. Timeand pain are inseparable."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWTHE POWER TO CHOOSEWhat about all those people who, it seems, actually want to suffer? I have afriend whose partner is physically abusive toward her, and her previousrelationship was of a similar kind. Why does she choose such men, and why is sherefusing to get out of that situation now? Why do so many people actually choosepain?I know that the word choose is a favorite New Age term, but it isn't entirelyaccurate in this context. It is misleading to say that somebody “chose” adysfunctional relationship or any other negative situation in his or her life.Choice implies consciousness a high degree of consciousness. Without it, youhave no choice. Choice begins the moment you disidentify from the mind and itsconditioned patterns, the moment you become present. Until you reach that point,you are unconscious, spiritually speaking. This means that you are compelled tothink, feel, and act in certain ways according to the conditioning of your mind.That is why Jesus said: “Forgive them, for they know not what they do.” This isnot related to intelligence in the conventional sense of the word. I have metmany' highly intelligent and educated people who were also completelyunconscious, which is to say completely identified with their mind. In fact, ifmental development and increased knowledge are not counterbalanced by acorresponding growth in consciousness,the potential for unhappiness and disaster is very great. Your friend is stuckin a relationship with an abusive partner, and not for the first time. Why? Nochoice. The mind, conditioned as it is by the past, always seeks to re-create what it knows and is familiar with. Even if it is painful, at least it isfamiliar. The mind always adheres to the known. The unknown is dangerous becauseit has no control over it. Thats why the mind dislikes and ignores the presentmoment. Present-moment awareness creates a gap not only in the stream of mindbut also in the past-future continuum. Nothing truly new and creative can comeinto this world except through that gap, that clear space of infinitepossibility.So your friend, being identified with her mind, may be re-creating a patternlearned in the past in which intimacy and abuse are inseparably linked.Alternatively, she may be acting out a mind pattern learned in early childhoodaccording to which she is unworthy and deserves to be punished. It is possible,too, that she lives a large part of her life through the pain-body, which alwaysseeks more pain on which to feed. Her partner has his own unconscious patterns,which complement hers. Of course her situation is self- created, but who or whatis the self that is doing the creating? A mental-emotional pattern from thepast, no more. Why make a self out of it? If you tell her that she has chosenher condition or situation, you are reinforcing her state of mindidentification. But is her mind pattern who she is? Is it her self? Is her trueidentity derived from the past? Show your friend how to be the observingpresence behind her thoughts and her emotions. Tell her about the pain-body andhow to free herself from it. Teach her the art of inner-body awareness.Demonstrate to her the meaning of presence. As soon as she is able to access thepower of the Now, and thereby break through her conditioned past, she will havea choice.Nobody chooses dysfunction, conflict, pain. Nobody chooses insanity. They happenbecause there is not enough presence in you to dissolve the past, not enoughlight to dispel the darkness. You are not fully here. You have not quite wokenup yet. In the meantime, the conditioned mind is running your life.Similarly, if you are one of the many people who have an issue with theirparents, if you still harbor resentment about something they did or did not do,then you still believe that they had a choice that they could have acteddifferently. It always looks as if people had a choice, but that is an illusion.As long as your mind with its conditioned patterns runs your life, as long asyou are your mind, what choice do you have? None. You are not even there. Themind-identified state is severely dysfunctional. It is a form of insanity.Almost everyone is suffering from this illness in varying degrees. The momentyou realize this, there can be no more resentment. How can you resent someone'sillness? The only appropriate response is compassion.So that means nobody is responsible for what they do? I don't like that idea.If you are run by your mind, although you have no choice you will still sufferthe consequences of your unconsciousness, and you will create further suffering.You will bear the burden of fear, conflict, problems, and pain. The sufferingthus created will eventually force you out of your unconscious state.What you say about choice also applies to forgiveness, I suppose. You need to befully conscious and surrender before you can forgive.“Forgiveness” is a term that has been in use for 2,000 years, but most peoplehave a very limited view of what it means. You cannot truly forgive yourself orothers as long as you derive your sense of self from the past. Only throughaccessing the power of the Now, which is your own power, can there be trueforgiveness. This renders the past powerless,and you realize deeply that nothing you ever did or that was ever done to youcould touch even in the slightest the radiant essence of who you are. The wholeconcept of forgiveness then becomes unnecessary.And how do I get to that point of realization?When you surrender to what is and so become fully present, the past ceases tohave any power. You do not need it anymore. Presence is the key. The Now is thekey.How will I know when I have surrendered?When you no longer need to ask the question."},{"pageContent":"THE POWER OF NOWEND"}]
