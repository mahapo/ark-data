Sea- soned, wise, and practical, Parenting with Presence helps parents take a deep breath and tend to themselves and their kids with com- passion, love, and mindfulness.” — Jack Kornfield, author of A Path with Heart , and Trudy Goodman, PhD, founder of InsightLA “I’ve led a community of hundreds of thousands of parents for six years, and during that time I’ve recommended only one parent- ing book: Parenting Without Power Struggles . Now I finally have one more to insist they read: Parenting with Presence . I trust Susan Stiffelman with my heart, my family, and my community because she understands that parenting is not just a job but a spiritual prac- tice — a path to healing, to truth, to God. She knows that what goes on in my home every day is brutal and beautiful and hard and holy. She understands that while we are raising our children, we are still raising ourselves. In Parenting with Presence , Susan comes alongside parents not only as an expert but as a guide, a counselor, a friend, a healer. This book will help adults heal so they can raise children who need a little less healing.” — Glennon Doyle Melton, author of the New York Times bestseller Carry On, Warrior , president of the nonprofit Together Rising, and founder of the online community at Momastery.com “ Parenting with Presence is a gentle but powerful reminder that our own awareness, our own calmness, and our ability to respond and not react to stressful situations are fundamental to raising healthy kids. It ’s more about us as parents than it is about them as children. And if we do the work on ourselves, then we can be circuit breakers for the flow of negative energy that escalates stressful situations.

Bravo!” — Janet Bray Attwood, New York Times bestselling author of The Passion Test: The Effortless Path to Discovering Your Life Purpose “The core secret revealed in Parenting with Presence is that presence is the only effective way to interact with children. Presence includes support and structure — with that, children thrive; without that, children experience chaos, and parenting can be a nightmare. The second secret is that parenting is a growth process, and your child is your best teacher. Understanding both secrets prevents parenting that nurtures without structure and parenting that shapes without nurture.

For all except the most rudimentary jobs, certain qualifi cations are required, and for the more complex jobs, years of training. Yet for one of the most challenging and vitally important occupations — parenting — no training or qualifi ca- tions are required. “Parenthood remains the greatest single preserve of the am- ateur,” wrote author Alvin Toffl er. This lack of knowledge or ed- ucation is one of the reasons (although not the main one, as we shall see) why so many parents struggle. Those parents don’t nec- essarily fail to meet the child ’s physical and material needs. They may in fact love their child and want what is best for them. Yet they are clueless as to how to deal with the challenges their child presents them with on an almost daily basis, nor do they know how to respond appropriately to the growing child ’s emotional, psychological, and spiritual needs."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"xii Parenting with Presence Whereas in past ages parenting was excessively authoritar- ian, in our contemporary society many parents fail to provide the clear guidance the child desperately needs and longs for. There is often a complete lack of structure in the home environment, which resembles a rudderless ship that has been abandoned by the captain, adrift in the ocean. The parents don’t realize that the child needs them to be, as Susan Stiffelman so aptly calls it, “the Captain of the ship,” a term that by no means implies reverting back to the authoritarian mode of education of past ages. Rather, it is about finding a balance, a middle way, between having an excess of structure and no structure at all. Ultimately, though, the deeper cause of family dysfunction is not the parents’ lack of knowledge or education but their lack of awareness. Without a conscious parent there can be no conscious parenting! A conscious parent is able to maintain a certain level of awareness in their daily life, even though for most people lapses are bound to happen from time to time. When there is no aware- ness (other names for it are mindfulness or presence ), you relate to your child, as well as to everybody else, through the conditioning of your mind. You are in the grip of mental/emotional reactive patterns, beliefs, and unconscious assumptions that you absorbed from your parents and the surrounding culture you grew up in. Many of these patterns go back countless generations into the distant past. However, when there is awareness — or presence, as I prefer to call it — you become aware of your own mental, emo- tional, and behavioral patterns. You begin to have a choice about how to respond to your children, rather than acting blindly out of old patterns. Also, most important, you no longer pass those patterns on to your children. Without presence, you are only able to connect with the child through the thinking mind and emotions, rather than on the deeper level of Being. Even if you do all the right things, the most"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Foreword xiii important ingredient in your relationship with your child will be missing: the Being dimension, which is the spiritual realm. This means the deeper connection just isn’t there. Intuitively, the child will sense that something vitally impor- tant in his or her relationship with you is missing, that you are never fully present, never fully there, always in your mind. Un- consciously, the child will then assume or rather feel that you are withholding something important. This frequently gives rise to unconscious anger or resentment in the child, which may manifest in various ways or remain latent until adolescence. Although this alienation between parent and child is still the norm, a change is happening. An increasing number of parents are becoming conscious, able to transcend the conditioned pat- terns of their mind and connect with their child on the deeper level of Being. So the reasons for dysfunctional or unconscious parenting are twofold. On the one hand, there is the lack of knowledge or education concerning child rearing that strikes a sane balance between the old, excessively authoritarian approach and the con- temporary, equally unbalanced one. On the other hand, and at a more fundamental level, there is the lack of presence or conscious awareness on the part of the parents. Whereas numerous books provide helpful “know-how” for those parents who read books, not many books as yet address the lack of awareness of the parents or offer guidance on how to use the everyday challenges of parenting as a way of growing in conscious- ness. Susan Stiffelman’s book helps the reader on both levels, which we could call Doing and Being. She imparts insightful knowledge and practical advice on Doing (or Right Action, as the Buddhists call it), without neglecting the more fundamental level of Being.

It helps turn the ways"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xiv Parenting with Presence your children challenge you into a mirror that allows you to be- come aware of your own hitherto unconscious patterns.

As the editor of a small health and wellness magazine, she got things done effi - ciently, thoroughly, and on time. Although her staff sometimes felt micromanaged, she went out of her way to create an appeal- ing work environment, offering generous perks such as fl exible telecommuting options and a break room stocked with organic snacks. But Angie was committed to leading a life that wasn’t all about being productive. Every morning she listened to a guided meditation before getting ready for the day ahead, and before they had children, she and her husband, Eric, had made a point of going to yoga retreats whenever possible. Eric had a small Internet marketing company based out of their home. He was known for his ability to think outside the box and enjoyed growing success based on his creativity and can-do, get-it-done-on-time reputation. Angie and Eric were thrilled when their son, Charlie, was born. They were committed to establishing a family different from the ones in which they had been raised.

Eric’s parents were involved, but overly so, controlling Eric’s and his sister’s activities and as he put it, robbing them of their voice. Both Angie and Eric were de- termined to give their children the combination of freedom and attention they had missed out on during their own childhoods. As Charlie grew, Angie and Eric delighted in his big per- sonality. But he had a feisty temperament, making him easily frustrated and difficult to soothe; as a toddler he had full-blown tantrums when he couldn’t have his way. Because they wanted to be compassionate and caring, his parents tried to explain to little Charlie why he couldn’t have what he wanted, but it only made things worse. And despite being excited about going to “big boy school,” he did not do well with the restrictions imposed on him when he started preschool. It was nearly impossible to sit still at story time, and his poor impulse control meant that whenever a child had a toy he wanted, Charlie simply took it — grabbing or shoving as needed. Soon after he was enrolled, Angie and Eric were called in to speak with the preschool director about an incident in which Charlie had forcefully pushed another child. This meeting turned out to be the first of many related to Charlie ’s difficulties in man- aging his behavior. The arrival of a baby sister when he was four only escalated his meltdowns. His parents tried to be understand- ing, but they were clueless about how to handle their temperamen- tal son — pleading, bargaining, threatening, and mostly caving in to his demands. Charlie ran the household with his tirades, and his parents could hardly remember their peaceful preparenting days.

Angie and Eric had believed that their commitment to per- sonal growth would somehow translate into having a sweet and easy time raising kids. After all, weren’t children influenced by their surroundings? Surely having a calm, loving home with at- tentive parents would ensure harmony within the family. But such was not the case. Angie ’s morn- ing meditations became a thing of the past, and as hard as they tried not to, she and Eric often fell into blaming, saying to each other things like, “If you had only handled the incident with Charlie this way instead of that , today’s crisis could have been avoided.” This couple was like many I have worked with over the past thirty years as a teacher, parent coach, and psy- chotherapist. Whether parents iden- tify themselves as traveling a path of personal development, or they simply want to raise happy children without drama or power struggles, they often have a difficult time coming to terms with the realities of raising kids, particularly when their child ’s needs or temperament prove challenging. Even if we have children who are relatively easy to raise, we still have to adapt to putting another being’s wants and needs ahead of our own, day in and day out. From sleepless nights to homework battles, we find ourselves having to develop new qualities as we go, such as tolerance, persistence, and the capacity to read the same picture book over and over . . . and over again. Those who consider themselves spiritually inclined sometimes confess to being morti- fied by how un spiritual they sometimes feel around their children. Whether parents identify themselves as traveling a path of personal development, or they simply want to raise happy children without drama or power struggles, they often have a difficult time coming to terms with the realities of raising kids, particularly when their child’s needs or temperament prove challenging."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence Words they never thought they would utter seem to fly out of their mouths — loudly — words that sound anything but enlightened! But like Angie and Eric, we often discover that the child we have is the one who can teach us the most. And that is what Par - enting with Presence is all about. We ’ll come back to Angie and Eric in a later chapter to discover how their challenges with Charlie paved the way for a much healthier parenting experience and how it provided opportunities for both of them to heal unfinished childhood business. For now, allow me to share a little of my own story. My Parenting Journey When I was fifteen years old and living in Kansas, my older brother headed off to college, leaving behind a note recommend- ing that I read a book he ’d put in my room called Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda . It sat on my shelf for two years until the day I found myself diving into it, moved by the tale of an Indian man’s journey to know the divine. This unusual book awakened something in me so profound that upon reading the final page, I pedaled my bike to the Prairie Village shopping center, deposited a handful of coins into the pay phone, dialed the headquarters of Yogananda’s California foun- dation, and said, “I want to know God.” For a year or so I meditated in Yogananda’s tradition, based on instructions sent weekly in the mail from the Self-Realization Fellowship. I started doing yoga and explored other types of med- itation, eventually settling on one that resonated with me, while weaving in other practices that nourished my heart and soul. I relied so much on the peace I experienced in my daily meditation that if I wasn’t able to sit in the morning, I would feel out of sorts all day until I could grab some time to go within. We often discover that the child we have is the one who can teach us the most."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Introduction  Eighteen years later, I had a baby. My once regular morning routine fell by the wayside as I struggled to bal- ance inner-focused activities with the pragmatics of family life. Whenever I was rigid about my “spiritually up- lifting” pursuits, I ended up feeling resentful and uptight. I had to figure out how not to tolerate but to savor the moments of ordinary life — changing a diaper, reading a story, or cleaning up after a hurricane of boy-play. One day I was in the kitchen, making my son a grilled-cheese sandwich. As I stood beside the stove waiting for the cheese to melt, I fell into an expanded awareness of what was going on in that moment. There, across the room, was a miracle in the form of someone I loved more than the beating of my heart, and I was getting the chance to express my love in the form of a sandwich. I felt intoxicated with gratitude, realizing that what I was feeling did not have to be an isolated experience; I could live more inti- mately with this kind of openheartedness as I went about the ordi- nary activities of my day, if I so chose. Raising a child turned out to be the greatest transformational experience of my life. I sat for meditation as often as I could — rarely, at first, but more often as my son got older. It is an enor- mous pleasure to drink from my inner well of stillness and joy, and meditation no doubt influences the “me” that shows up for the world. But I also came to understand that living spiritually means leading the life in front of me as fully present to spirit as possible, regardless of what ritual I might have practiced that morning. In Parenting with Presence , I invite you to embark on your own journey of bringing greater peace, joy, and personal transforma- tion to your day-to-day parenting. You will discover strategies to help you navigate the ups and downs of real-life child rearing with more consciousness, and learn how to subdue the triggers I had to figure out how not to tolerate but to savor the moments of ordinary life — changing a diaper, reading a story, or cleaning up after a hurricane of boy-play."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence that make you lose (or temporarily misplace!) your equanimity. And you’ll be invited to explore ways to bring spirituality into your home — even if you are not religiously inclined or have kids who think anything remotely spiritual is “uncool.” Throughout the book I will share some of the qualities I have come to believe are helpful in transforming a child into an adult who is conscious, confident, and caring. Finally, you will learn practical tools to help you parent with presence , responding with flexibility and choice instead of reacting out of frustration, anger, or fear. When our relationship with our children is permeated with our whole-hearted engagement and presence, they are more inclined to turn to us, rather than to their friends, for guidance and support. In addition, children who feel liked, seen, and cher- ished — just as they are — are naturally more motivated to do what their parents ask; it is human nature to cooperate with those we feel solidly connected to. Whether you are an avid spiritual practitioner or you sim- ply want to parent more consciously, raising children with greater presence will open you to more of the love, learning, and joy that the adventure of parenting can bring.

Our children may indeed catalyze a love within us that we could not have imagined possible. But they can also elicit pow- erful elements of our shadow selves, calling forth aspects of our nature, such as impatience and intolerance, that leave us ashamed and overwhelmed. Maintaining equilibrium is key to living in the moment, but nothing tests our ability to stay centered like parenting. Raising kids can be anything but peaceful, with sibling squabbles, home- work meltdowns, and arguments over video games all-too-familiar features of the landscape of family life.

There is a saying, When the student is ready, the teacher appears . I have long found it to be true that when I am ready to expand my horizons intellectually, psychologically, or spiritually, an opportu- nity presents itself that seems divinely orchestrated to allow me to stretch, grow, and learn. That said, I don’t always want to stretch, grow, and learn! Instead, I may feel as if I’ve been involuntarily enrolled in a class I had no desire to take! When it comes to parenting, it seems that although we may not have knowingly signed up for the “course” our children offer, we nonetheless find ourselves forced (“invited?” “given the op- portunity?”) to profoundly grow, and grow up. In this respect, I believe our children can become our greatest teachers. While we may not deliberately choose to have a baby so that we can heal wounds from our childhood or become a better version of our- selves, in fact, those opportunities — and thousands more — are birthed right along with our children. We may be confronted with our impatience, taught to slow down as our toddler requires us to stop and smell every flower along the sidewalk. Or we may learn fortitude as we survive our child ’s nightmares, discovering that we actually can be reasonably kind and loving after a series of sleepless nights.

Sometimes the lessons we learn from our children are gen- tle and sweet; our little ones expand our capacity to give and re- ceive more love and happiness than we ever imagined possible. But often, aspects of our child ’s temperament challenge us to the core. We may project our own needs onto our children, feeling that we ’re in battle mode from morning to night when we cannot force them to behave in ways that quell our fear and anxiety. We fall into bed exhausted at the end of each day, dreading the next morning when we have to wake up and do it all over again. One of the ways I choose to see challenging people as essen- tial to my evolution is to imagine the two of us in a preincarnated state — disembodied souls feeling only pure, limitless love for each other.

I will come back as your disabled child. I’ll learn to accept love more fully, and you will have the chance to learn patience.” “It ’s a deal!” And thus begins what Caroline Myss, lecturer and intuitive, refers to as a sacred contract , an agreement we have with the significant people in our lives orchestrating the precise circum- stances that will allow us to become more fully who we are meant to be.

You’re so uptight when we have people over.’ I blew my stack; I do so much for her! Why couldn’t she do this one little thing for me?” I listened for a while and then asked Catherine, “How did your parents respond to you when you expressed a wish or a need? Did they listen and validate your requests, or did they dis- regard them?” Immediately, she had an answer. With a hint of sarcasm she replied, “When I had a need? I wasn’t allowed to have needs. That didn’t happen in our family.

Well, what I’ve noticed is that some kids get into their little car and freeze. They’ve never been behind the wheel of an automobile, and they don’t understand the concept of making it move by step- ping on the accelerator, so they just sit in the middle of the track and get slammed into by all the other wild drivers. “Then there are the kids at the other extreme. These are the ones who put the pedal to the floor and never let up. Whichever direction they turn that steering wheel, they’ll be crashing into something within seconds. In both cases, these young drivers don’t know how to appropriately press on the gas. Either they don’t move at all, or they recklessly fling themselves full speed ahead.” I explained that many people struggle to ask for what they want or need. “Some of us remain passively silent; we don’t ask for anything, feeling unseen, unimportant, and resentful.” “That ’s me,” she offered. “That ’s the story of my life, from childhood on through my marriage and divorce. I learned early on that asking for what I wanted was only going to upset the peo- ple around me.” “Other people demand what they want with guns blazing,” I replied. “They overpower those around them, determined to get their way, regardless of how badly they alienate others. “So,” I said, “would you be willing to look at this situation with your daughter from a different perspective? Could you see her as a teacher who is providing you with an excellent assign- ment ? Might you be ready to learn how to ask for what you want in a way that reflects an understanding that your wishes are as valid as those of the people around you?” Catherine was quiet. All traces of sarcasm were gone as she"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"You’re Living with Your Best Teacher  softly said, “Wow. Yes. It ’s time for me to learn to ask for what I need.” I replied, “By looking at why your child ’s behavior triggers you so deeply, you have an opportunity to heal something from long ago and grow into a more healthy and whole version of yourself.” Catherine was on board. Our work together shifted from “fixing” her daughter’s messiness to healing the sadness she felt as a little girl who had concluded that her desires and needs were not important — feelings she had buried long ago. I helped her understand that the intensity with which she had been coming at Shay to get her to cooperate was a result of projecting onto her daughter an unresolved longing to know that her own wishes and wants mattered. I explained that it isn’t our children’s job to fix us. In fact, they often dig in their heels when we come at them with our neediness and desperation. Intui- tively, they understand that it isn’t their responsibility to behave in ways that heal whatever wounds we bring from ear- lier relationships. So it can happen that our children’s misbehavior truly does become a gift, because if we are willing to look within instead of projecting our hurts onto them, we can work through unfinished emotional business. I encouraged Catherine to simply be present with whatever feelings came up for her when she was met with her daughter’s resistance. “Practice nonjudgmental awareness, allowing room for whatever emotions have gotten stirred up so they can have their say. Be sad or angry. Be confused or worried. And then, Intuitively, our children understand that it isn’t their responsibility to behave in ways that heal whatever wounds we bring from earlier relationships.

Let feelings move through you without censoring or controlling them. “Locate where in your body you are experiencing what you’re feeling. Is the sensation heavy? Sharp? Fluttery? Simply allow whatever you are experiencing to be , without making the emo- tions bigger or smaller. Name the feelings with loving-kindness. ‘There ’s sadness in my chest. It ’s heavy and flat and dark. And now there ’s anger. So sharp and hard. All through my body!’ “Avoid your left, rational brain’s attempts to explain away your discomfort. Resist the urge to make it about your daughter or the specific situation. Simply notice what you’re experiencing. Be patient. The emotions will pass through. You will feel better. The only way out is through. It is a process of grieving for the voice you didn’t have, the empathy you didn’t receive, and the hurt of having felt invisible.” This was — and is — a very deep process. It isn’t easy or quick. Old wounds need breathing room to heal. As you move through this process, I encourage you to be kind and patient with yourself, even as you begin trying new ways of dealing with your child when she activates an old hurt. With care, you can start to heal the dynamic, and yourself. Once Catherine allowed herself to grieve for the parts of her that had been afraid to express her wishes, she was ready to try new ways of asking things of her girls. I shared with her some- thing I once heard Diane Sawyer say when she was asked about the success of her long marriage. She replied, “I learned early on that a criticism is just a really lousy way of making a request. So. . . just make the request!” The Four Modalities of Interaction In our interactions with others, we generally fall into one of four categories. We are either passive, aggressive, passive-aggressive, or assertive."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"You’re Living with Your Best Teacher  We are in passive mode when we suppress what we truly feel, pretending that everything is okay. When we are passive, we say yes when we mean no, put others’ needs ahead of our own, and are terrified of ruffling anyone ’s feathers. Passive parents are afraid of their children’s upset and desperately want to be liked by them, so they give in to their demands. When we are aggressive , we come at our children using threats and intimidation to bend them to our will. It may look effective on the outside — the misbehavior stops — but this approach comes at a high price. Our children cannot feel close to us because we are not emotionally safe. Passive-aggressive parents control their children through shame and guilt. They may not be overtly aggressive, but their subtle guilt trips and manipulations are extremely harmful to their children’s developing sense of self. These kids feel inappropriately responsible for their parents’ needs and happiness rather than in tune with their own. If you say, “You’re the only child in this fam- ily who can’t seem to figure out how to set the table right,” you have just shamed your child. Telling her, “I didn’t sleep a wink last night, worrying about how I’m going to pay for that class trip you insist you have to go on,” she can’t help but feel guilty. These are very unhealthy ways of interacting with children. We are assertive when we are being what I call the Captain of the ship in our children’s lives. (More on this in chapter 2 .) In this mode, we maintain healthy boundaries with our children, allowing them to have their needs, wants, feelings, and prefer- ences without making them wrong when they don’t nicely over- lap with our own. We don’t need our children to like us, and we are not afraid of their unhappiness, recognizing that if we fix all their problems we are impairing their ability to develop true resil- ience. Our children know that they are loved for who they are, not for what they can do for us or how their achievements make us look to others."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence And when we are assertive, we can acknowledge that our children may not want to do what we ask, without taking their complaints personally or escalating the disagreement into a power struggle. We empathize with their position, allowing them to feel what they feel, but we are not reluctant to set limits that might dis- appoint them. My work with Catherine first fo- cused on helping her grieve for the sweet and loving childhood she never had. It was vulnerable work, but she was committed and moved through her old feelings bravely. Then we started practicing assertiveness. Since she had almost no experience with assertive behavior in either her childhood or her marriage, this was uncharted territory for her. But we had a lot of fun; we role-played scenarios in which she was able to practice expressing her wishes in a way that wasn’t aggressive (pressing the accelerator to the floor), passive (staying frozen and still), or passive-aggressive (using shame or put-downs). Catherine loved how she felt when she assertively voiced her needs. As a result of working through this emotional baggage, Catherine ’s requests lost their edginess and desperation, mak- ing it easier for Shay to agree to what her mother was asking of her. Catherine practiced coming alongside her daughter (what I call Act 1 Parenting) by letting Shay know that she understood that she might not think it was a big deal if she left her clothes strewn around her room. “You might even think that since it ’s your room, you should have the right to things the way you want them.” Because Shay felt understood and validated by her mom, she was less defensive and more receptive. “Unfortunately, sweetheart,” her assertive mom went on, When we are assertive, we can acknowledge that our children may not want to do what we ask, without taking their complaints personally or escalating the disagreement into a power struggle."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"You’re Living with Your Best Teacher  “since it does bother me to come into your room and see clothes everywhere, and I’m the one paying the rent, I’d like you to make more of an effort to keep it clean.

And it will be great if you would make sure that you leave the bathroom the way you found it — which means that your towels find their way into the hamper!” Before Catherine discovered what lay buried beneath her heightened sensitivity to this issue with her daughter, either she kept her foot off the gas (passively saying nothing but teeming with repressed anger and resentment), or she slammed on the accelerator (aggressively coming at her daughter with criticism and anger). By choosing to see her daughter as a wonderful teacher who was providing her with an assignment to reclaim her voice and to respectfully ask for what she needed, Catherine began to feel even closer to Shay.

There is something about a child ’s high-pitched wail that can set a parent ’s teeth on edge. But becoming reactive only makes the problem worse. Try viewing your daughter’s whining as a completely neu- tral event. Just as with a child who persistently taps his pencil or kicks his foot, these behaviors aren’t inherently good or bad. What makes them annoying is that we decide that they are, which sets us up for a power struggle. If you need your child to stop doing some- thing because you decide it ’s irritating, then unless your connec- tion is very strong, you are likely to provoke her into persisting. It may sound very Zen-like, but if you can move into a place of noticing rather than labeling or judging her whiny voice, you will be able to say, “Sweetheart, I want to hear what you need, and I’m happy to wait until you can use your regular voice.” When you are less reactive, your daughter should be able to figure out how to appropriately ask for what she wants.

Unfortunately, many take on the snarky behavior of kids on pop- ular TV shows, where eye rolling and talking back is rewarded with an enthusiastic laugh track. Refuse to make your daughter’s eye rolling mean more than what it is — an awkward and (hopefully) ineffective way of announcing that she doesn’t feel like doing what you’ve asked or that she is testing your limits.

Realizing that his unconscious mother would not be able to pre- vent the car from careening out of control, her eleven-year-old son unhooked his seat belt and attempted to steer the car to safety. When he realized that he couldn’t fi gure out what to do, he fran- tically belted himself back in just seconds before their Suburban hit four cars — including ours. His mother woke up when she crashed into a guardrail. Thankfully, none of the eleven people involved in the accident was badly hurt. Children are meant to be passengers. They aren’t equipped to drive a car or sail a ship through storms — and they know it. But when no one is in the driver’s seat, they instinctively try to take over. They don’t want to be in charge; it ’s just that they know somebody has to be, because they understand that life is not safe unless someone competent is behind the wheel.

Parents who are calmly and confidently in charge as the Cap- tain of the ship come across as clear, loving, and capable of mak- ing good decisions on behalf of their children — even if those decisions upset their kids because they can’t have what they want. When we are captaining the ship, we are responsively flexible, choos- ing how we engage with our child during one of his storms rather than reflexively reacting based on triggered behaviors we inherited from our own upbringing. Here is a brief example. Your thir- teen-year-old asks if she can go to a party where the only super- vision will be an older sister who is not known for her good judgment. mom: “Honey, I know you want to go, but unfortunately, I don’t feel it ’s a good idea.” Parents who are calmly and confidently in charge, being Captain of the ship, come across as clear, loving, and capable of making good decisions on behalf of their children, even if those decisions upset their kids because they can’t do or have what they want. captain — parent in charge two lawyers — no one in charge dictator — child in charge"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Growing Up While Raising Kids  daughter: “Please, Mom? I promise nothing bad will happen.” mom: “Oh, sweetheart. I know it doesn’t seem fair, and I know how much you want to go, but I’m afraid not.” Mom is being the Captain , demonstrating empathy and kind- ness while remaining decisive and clear. Depending on how ac- customed your child is to you changing your mind or waffling, she may attempt to draw you into the next way of interacting. When parents engage in quarrels, power struggles, and nego- tiations with their kids, no one is in charge. I call this mode the Two Lawyers . Kids push against their parents, parents push against their kids, and the relationship is fraught with ten- sion and resentment. Here ’s an example: daughter: “Mom, you treat me like I’m a two-year-old. You never trust me!” mom: “You’re never happy unless you get what you want! Carey’s sister is immature, and I don’t trust her to keep an eye on you guys. She ’ll probably just have a party of her own!

She was blamed for smoking pot in the school bathroom, but she wasn’t even smoking! She just happened to be there when those other girls were doing it!” These kind of parent-child interactions are characterized by fighting, arguing, and bargaining. Finally, when the child is the one calling the shots, the parents feel out of control and even panicked, especially if they imagine that others are judging them for not managing their kids well. They try to restore order and control by overpowering their chil- dren with threats, bribes, or ultimatums, similar to how a tyrant or despot — having no authentic authority — asserts control When parents engage in quarrels, power struggles, and negotiations with their kids, no one is in charge."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence through fear and intimidation.

I work hard just to put food on the table, and you never even say thank you. You’re grounded!” As you can see, this situation rapidly deteriorates, with mom quickly losing her footing and shifting from Captain to Lawyer and, finally, entering Dictator mode . Staying in Captain mode requires that we become comfortable setting limits so that we can parent with kindness, clarity, and confidence. Setting Limits In my counseling practice, I often see well-meaning couples who are committed to avoiding the mistakes their own parents made, yet who confess to having a tremendous lack of confidence when it comes to handling challenging situations. “Is it okay if I let my fourteen-year-old experiment with smoking pot? His friends are all trying it.” “I tried to cancel my son’s World of Warcraft sub- scription, but he got so furious he punched a hole in the wall!” “My kids become little terrors when we go out to eat unless I turn my cell phone over to them. Should I give in to keep the peace?” Unsure of themselves and afraid to set limits, they convey to their children that they don’t know where they stand, or perhaps more accurately, that they are simply afraid to take a stand, lest they upset their children. Staying in Captain mode requires that we become comfortable setting limits so that we can parent with kindness, clarity, and confidence."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Growing Up While Raising Kids  What I find interesting is that the very kids who have outbursts when they don’t get their way almost always long for their parents to create some real con- nection and structure. Sometimes, when I meet privately with youngsters like these, they tell me that they wish their parents weren’t so wishy-washy. And other times, they make this known simply by responding positively when someone combines limit setting with deep and secure attachment. Henry was one such child. Forging a Real Connection Henry was eleven when Bradley and Melissa brought him to see me. He sauntered into my office playing his portable game player (this was a few years ago) and dripping with attitude. When his parents meekly suggested that he put the device down and greet me, he glared at them and continued to play. When I met with them alone, they admitted to being clueless about how to han- dle their son’s severe meltdowns. Raised by an older father who believed boys should be tough, Henry had learned to stifle his more tender feelings from a young age and had lost his ability to feel emotions such as fear, sadness, and hurt; his repertoire was limited to frustration and anger. Henry was a big child and could turn violent when provoked. His parents were terrified of him. When I met alone with Henry, however, I found him to be a gentle but very ungrounded child. He seemed to be floating above himself, unaccustomed to full contact with a caring grown-up who didn’t want anything from him. The majority of his adult interactions consisted of people trying to coerce him to do things he didn’t want to do. I began by showing an interest in discovering who Henry The very kids who have outbursts when they don’t get their way almost always long for their parents to create some real connection and structure."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence was. As we talked, he tentatively opened up, telling me how much he loved drawing and about his dream of designing video games. When I noticed that he kept splitting his attention between our conversation and his gaming device, I asked him — in a friendly way — to hand it to me, explaining that it seemed as though it had a particularly strong hold on him. I put the device on a shelf in my office, where it remained for many months, with a surprising degree of acceptance. Henry and I began to forge a real connection. I was steady in my kindness and interest, and he slowly began to trust that I was his ally. I found the coaching sessions with his parents more challenging. Melissa and Bradley were resistant to doing the work of applying what we spoke about in our sessions — coming along- side rather than at Henry. Again and again they used logic, bribes, or threats to compel him to do what they wanted. It seemed as if they were more invested in having me change their son so he would just do what they asked rather than in improving the qual- ity of their relationship with him. Early one evening, my phone rang. It was Bradley, calling me from the parking lot of a restaurant, distraught. Apparently, Henry had had a major tantrum in the restaurant and had fled to the parking lot, where he was dodging his parents. Bradley and Melissa were desperately trying to corral their son into the car so they could head home. “Will you talk to Henry? Will you con- vince him to get into the car?” Bradley pleaded. It was an unusual request, but I agreed, not knowing quite what I was going to be up against. But this is how it went down: Brad- ley got close enough to Henry to tell him that Susan was on the phone and that she wanted to talk to him. Henry took the phone right away. I simply said, “Sweetheart, it ’s time to get into the car.” “Okay.” That was it. He handed the phone back to his father and got in the car."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Growing Up While Raising Kids  What did I do that his parents couldn’t have done? What power did I have over Henry that made him say yes? None. But I did have two things: an authentic connection with him — he knew that I liked, enjoyed, and respected him — and legitimate standing as the Captain of the ship in our relationship. I wasn’t afraid of him, I didn’t need him to bolster my sense of self-worth, and I had proved that I genuinely cared about him. He knew that I was on his side. How had I accomplished this? By listening to Henry with full presence, accepting him as he was. He knew that I found him funny and interesting. He knew that I had no ulterior motive; I didn’t need anything from him. So he responded positively to my request, as we are inclined to do when a person we like asks some- thing of us. Sadly, the only time Henry was given his parent ’s complete attention was either when they were trying to convince him to do something he did not want to do — finishing homework, taking a shower, coming to dinner — or when they wanted him to stop doing something that he did want to do, such as playing video games or enjoying the coziness of his warm bed in the morning. Rarely did they invest time in getting to know their son as a per- son — not because they were lacking in love, but because like many parents, they were driven and distracted by the demands and stressors of their busy lives. As a result, Henry felt no alle- giance to his parents, making him minimally invested in pleasing them. In the absence of any reservoir of goodwill with Henry, they felt forced to bribe or threaten him to elicit his cooperation.

My work with them began when their son, Charlie, was four and a half. They came to see me because Charlie had been threatened with suspension from preschool for his aggressive behavior. They had also reached their limit at home, where their son’s outbursts had established a climate of constant chaos and tension. I began by exploring Angie and Eric’s internal conflicts around setting limits. Both parents were uncertain about how, when, or where they should draw the line with little Charlie. In Eric’s case, his lack of clarity was a result of having been raised by overly restrictive parents who controlled his every move. He was determined to provide his children with the freedom to make their own choices. As a result, he admitted to often erring on the side of setting unclear guidelines for his son. We spoke about the idea of dampening a child ’s spirit. “Eric, it sounds as though you are passionate about wanting your chil- dren to have their voice and to be free to express their wishes.” He nodded, affirming that this was something he felt strongly about. I asked him to talk about what it had been like for him growing up, and he spoke about how overpowered he felt by his parents, who dictated his every move. “If they wanted me to take piano lessons, I had to take them — and practice every day. I didn’t like the piano, but that didn’t matter. It was their way or the highway. Same with what clothes I wore, what TV shows I watched, which sports activities I took part in — I had no way of asserting my will in my family. I felt weak and powerless, and I’m determined not to raise my kids that way.” Wisely, Eric understood that his children were separate and unique individuals, not meant to be the agents of his own unfulfilled dreams. But Eric’s unfinished business was having a negative impact on how he was raising his son. “Unfortunately, because this was such a significant hurt for you growing up, you run the risk of"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Growing Up While Raising Kids  overcompensating for the strictness of your parents by being so unstructured with Charlie that it is actually hurting him.” I told them that I encounter this predicament a lot, particularly with parents who take their personal growth or spiritual practices very seriously. I have great admiration for those who are commit- ted to conscious parenting — empower- ing their children to speak their minds and hearts and to trust their feelings and intuitions. But we have to provide them with structure and not be afraid of estab- lishing limits. Given how badly things had deteriorated with Charlie, Eric was open to considering that there might be a way to be more assertive with Charlie without crushing his spirit. Angie, triggered when her son’s tantrums reminded her of her mother’s unpredictable and explosive rages, found it easier to cave in to Charlie ’s demands than to set boundaries. And the con- stant tension he created meant that she found herself less eager to spend time with him, plopping him down in front of an iPad or TV screen, where he wouldn’t make any trouble. But little Charlie pushed for contact with his mother, even if it required misbehav- ing. He had discovered that acting out was a way to ensure receiv- ing 100 percent of her attention. In some respects, he was a little Henry in the making. Essentially, Charlie needed to find out if his parents were capable of creating a container within which he could safely explore the world. His behavior was in effect an announcement that he didn’t feel safe sailing the seas of his life in the absence of a competent Captain. As a result, whenever Charlie experienced I have great admiration for those who are committed to conscious parenting — empowering their children to speak their minds and hearts and to trust their feelings and intuitions.

I explained the three modes of parenting and the importance of stepping into the role of Captain of the ship. They both agreed that they mostly lived in Dictator mode — letting Charlie call the shots and have his way until things got so awful that they would threaten severe punishment to snap him back to his senses. But resorting to anger was unaligned with their more spiritual values, leaving them feeling guilty and remorseful. And thus the cycle was perpetuated — enduring their son’s tirades until they reached their tipping point, exploding at him, then feeling shame about their inability to stay calm and centered. I shared with Angie and Eric what Eckhart Tolle refers to as the “pain-body” — residual emotional pain that feeds off nega- tivity. He writes, “While the child is having a pain-body attack, there isn’t much you can do except to stay present so that you are not drawn into an emotional reaction. The child ’s pain-body would only feed on it. Pain- bodies can be extremely dramatic. Don’t buy into the drama. Don’t take it too seriously. If the pain-body was trig- gered by thwarted wanting, don’t give in now to its demands. Otherwise, the child will learn: ‘The more unhappy I become, the more likely I am to get what I want.’ ” Tolle suggests that when a child is having a meltdown, it is an unconscious attempt on the part of their pain-body to strengthen itself by pulling others into drama and misery. Whether or not this language is familiar to you, the idea “While the child is having a pain-body attack, there isn’t much you can do except to stay present so that you are not drawn into an emotional reaction. . . . Don’t take it too seriously. If the pain-body was triggered by thwarted wanting, don’t give in now to its demands.

When we take our child ’s misbehavior per- sonally, our ego gets involved, generating desperation or a need for control, pulling out all the stops to assert itself. Once this dynamic is in play, we are inevitably going to move into Law- yer or Dictator mode because, in a sense, the ego has committed mutiny, hijacking the Captain and the calm leadership that would otherwise ensure smooth sailing through a child ’s storm. Being Clear, Connected, and Present The one person Charlie seemed to behave well with was his babysitter. Alison was in her midtwenties and had no children but had been raised in a large, close-knit family. She exuded a kind of no-nonsense attitude that made it clear that she was comfortable being in charge. She and Charlie had a very playful and loving relationship, but when she told him to brush his teeth or stop teas- ing his sister, he almost always cooperated. I suspected that there were a number of reasons Charlie was able to manage his behav- ior with Alison. First, she didn’t take his behavior personally; she was not invested in his being a “good boy” the way Angie and Eric were and was therefore less desperate or needy when she interacted with him. In other words, Charlie was not the means by which she proved that she was a good or competent person. But there was more to it than that. As Angie talked about Alison’s relationship with her son, it was obvious that Alison enjoyed Charlie. They laughed a lot when they were together, and Alison invested plenty of time meeting him exactly where he was — play- ing with robots, building forts, or just chasing each other around the yard. Whereas most of Angie ’s interactions with her son were focused on getting things checked off a list — breakfast, dressing for school, taking a bath — Alison slowed down and was genu- inely present with Charlie. She listened attentively when he made"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence up a story about his dinosaurs, asking questions and taking obvious pleasure in his vivid imagination. She kept her cell phone muted when they were having special playtime so Charlie didn’t feel he was constantly competing with outside people intruding on their time, as he did with his parents. Alison had fun with Charlie at least a little bit each day, making it clear that she liked him, an essential ingredient in catalyzing a child ’s willingness to cooperate. Alison was consistently making deposits in her emotional bank account with Charlie, giving him heartfelt doses of pure presence, focus, and attention. Every friendly interaction was like depositing a coin in the “account” of their relationship, making it easy for her to make what might feel to Charlie like “withdrawals” when she wanted him to comply with a request. Charlie was more inclined to cooperate with Alison, not because he was afraid of being punished by her but because he wanted to please her, know- ing she genuinely cared for him. As Angie and Eric described Alison’s communication style, it also became clear that when she made requests of Charlie, she meant business, and he knew it. While he sensed his parent ’s lack of decisiveness when they told him it was time to come to dinner or put on his shoes, he perceived Alison’s delivery as clear, loving, and firm, prompting consent. Her requests didn’t end with “. . . okay?” Rather, she announced what had to be done as the Captain of the ship, remaining compassionate when he voiced his reluctance but unwavering in her clarity. Angie and Eric admitted to feeling a little jealous of Alison’s ability to expect and receive cooperative behavior from Charlie. They tried mimicking her words, but Charlie still resisted.

When children feel a connection with the person mak- ing a request, their instinct to cooperate is awakened, naturally inclining them to comply. Charlie knew that his babysitter enjoyed him, making him want to behave well when he was with her. Letting Your Child Feel Sad There was another element I wanted to explore in my work with Angie and Eric: I needed to know how they felt about allowing their son to be sad or disappointed, something I always look at when a child is chronically angry or aggressive. I often observe parents having great difficulty tolerating their child ’s unhappi- ness. In fact, there is a quote, “A mother/father is only as happy as their saddest child.” While this is a sweet sentiment, it high- lights one of the greatest challenges we face: recognizing that our children are separate people on their own life ’s journey. I remember a conversation I had with Sally, one of my closest friends, when I realized that my marriage was not likely to sur- vive. I was heartbroken that I couldn’t protect my son from what was coming. How could I, a therapist who had seen so many chil- dren struggle through their parents’ divorces, put my son through that? I said to Sally, “Ari isn’t supposed to go through this — the coming apart of his family in this way. He ’s not supposed to have to deal with this.” I will never forget her response. She looked me in the eye and said, “How do you know what he ’s supposed to go through?” I got it. I understood that although wild horses couldn’t stop me from doing my best to provide my son with a good life, he was indeed going to have experiences — difficult ones — that I When children feel a connection with the person making a request, their instinct to cooperate is awakened, naturally inclining them to comply."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence could not prevent, no matter how hard I tried. The best I could do at those times was to stay lovingly present to him as he traveled through pain and disappointment. Now that he is twenty-four, I can see the ways that he was strengthened and made more com- passionate by working through the losses I wanted to protect him from. This is not to say that I would suggest putting kids through hardships to build character; nothing could be further from the truth. But when we cannot shield our children from painful experiences, the next best thing is to be fully present to them, helping them through the pro- cess by letting them feel their sadness and disappointment. There is a poignant scene in the show Parenthood that illustrates this beautifully. Max, the fifteen-year-old son of Christina and Adam, struggles to fit in at his high school because his Asperger’s has made him an outcast. Blessedly, he has discovered that he has a great talent for taking photographs, resulting in his being assigned the job as yearbook photographer. Unfortunately, he starts snapping pictures of a girl as she is sob- bing while surrounded by friends. The girls tell Max to go away, but he insensitively insists that he ’s supposed to take B-roll shots for the yearbook, and he carries on. Max’s parents are called to school for a meeting at which they are informed that Max cannot continue to take yearbook photos; the teacher has reassigned him to layout. They beg the teacher and principal to reconsider, pull- ing out all the stops in an effort to ensure that their son will have this one satisfying school experience, but the girl’s complaints make it impossible for Max to continue. Christina bears the burden of informing Max that he has lost When we cannot shield our children from painful experiences, the next best thing is to be fully present to them, helping them through the process by letting them feel their sadness and disappointment."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Growing Up While Raising Kids  his position as yearbook photographer. She walks into his room, sits down, and with great anguish, tells her son that he has been moved from photography to layout. “What? I don’t want to do layout! I want to be the photographer! I’m the best one for the job!” Christina says, “I know, Max, but the teacher has decided and won’t change his mind.” Max is furious. None of this makes sense to him; in his mind, he did nothing wrong, and logically, should be taking photos for the yearbook. He says, “What are you going to do about it?” With an aching heart, Christina looks at her son and says simply, “I’m just going to sit here with you and be sad.” I was enormously touched by this scene. Because Christina had moved through her grief around being unable to prevent her son from losing something that mattered so much to him, she was able to be with him as he dealt with letting go of something he wanted so badly. She didn’t explain, justify, or even attempt to make him feel better. Instead, she was simply present with him, trusting that the waves of his disappointment would wash over him and then recede and that he would find his way through loss to acceptance. Helping Children Move through Loss I knew that because Eric and Angie wanted Charlie to be happy, they routinely gave in to his demands or tried to talk him out of his upset. Not surprisingly, they confessed that their son seldom cried. This little boy would pop with rage if he didn’t get his way, but his anger rarely moved on to actual sadness or tears. I asked Angie and Eric to consider what it would be like to not fix Charlie ’s problems when he was frustrated, instead helping him feel his unhappiness. Imagining this caused them both to feel unsettled. “If I love my son,” asked Eric, “how can I not want to make him happy?”"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence I asked them what they ultimately wanted for Charlie as he headed into adulthood — what skills and resources they hoped he would have internalized that would let them know he was likely to have a good life. “We want him to know how to get along with people and to have a positive attitude that helps him attract good things. And we want him to be able to handle the tough times as well.” I explained that for children to develop the internal resources to accept life on its terms, they must be allowed to move through the stages of denial, anger, and bargaining when they can’t have what they want so that they can then move through their dis- appointment to acceptance — an idea I borrowed from Elisabeth Kübler-Ross’s work with the dying and that I explain more fully in Parenting Without Power Struggles. The acronym for these stages is DABDA. Angie and Eric’s desire to insulate their son from the full weight of his disappointments was keeping Charlie in what I refer to as the DAB — the first three stages of grieving: denial, anger, and bargaining. Because they usually caved in when Charlie ’s frustration began to escalate, he started out in a state of denial when he asked for something. Understandably, he didn’t believe that no really meant no, based on past experiences, so he stayed in denial, unable to accept that this time his parents were not going to give in to his demands. Pushing back at Charlie with matching fury kept him in the stage of anger. Parent and child lobbed reactive, hurtful missiles back and forth at each other, with ever-increasing rage on both sides. When his parents engaged in heated debates about why Charlie couldn’t have what he wanted, they were fueling the bar- gaining stage, in effect encouraging their son to argue for what- ever he was demanding. Stepping into the Captain role with Charlie meant they"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Growing Up While Raising Kids  would need to be anchored firmly enough within themselves to endure his sorrow or disappointment (Kübler-Ross calls this stage “depression”). This was an essential step toward helping Charlie reduce the reservoir of frustration that so easily exploded whenever he encountered something he couldn’t change or con- trol. Unless a child can feel sad when he cannot have what he wants, he will never make it to the stage of acceptance. “What message does Charlie get about your belief in his capacity to handle disappointment when you jump through hoops to prevent him from feeling sad?” I asked. Thinking about it this way made an impact. They began to see that when they fixed Charlie ’s problems or tried to explain away his upsets, they were in effect telling him they didn’t have faith that he had the inter- nal resources to deal with life when it didn’t go his way — not a good message to communicate to a child if you’re hoping he will become a resilient adult. Still, Angie was afraid to stand firm with Charlie. Just think- ing about it made her tremble inside. “I hate to admit it, but I’m a pushover. I can’t imagine standing up to Charlie when he starts heading into one of his tirades. It ’s like trying to stay upright in the middle of a hurricane!” I asked her to stand in front of me and picture herself with Charlie when he started revving up to have a melt- down. “Tune in to what is going on in your body.” She closed her eyes, got quiet, and then described herself as feel- ing very young and very shaky. “I feel like a little girl — not strong enough to cope. I want to crawl under a rock and hide.” She acknowledged that these were familiar feelings, reminiscent of all the times when They began to see that when they fixed Charlie’s problems or tried to explain away his upsets, they were in effect telling him they didn’t have faith that he had the internal resources to deal with life when it didn’t go his way — not a good message to communicate to a child if you’re hoping he will become a resilient adult."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence she had felt too weak to deal with her mother’s intensity and chaos. While she was in this state, I told her that I was going to push gently against her. When I did, she instantly lost her balance, catching herself just before she toppled over. “Now I want you to imagine a steel cable running from the top of your head, down through your body, into the soles of your feet, continuing straight down into the center of the earth. Picture that steel cable as rigid and unwavering. Nothing can make it move or sway. Feel your strength; feel yourself as sturdy as an ancient red- wood tree whose roots go deeply down into the ground.” As she imagined this, I pushed exactly as hard as I had before. This time, instead of easily losing her balance, she was immovable. “How did that feel, Angie?” “It felt great! I felt my strength; I felt solid and steady. Pow- erful, without having to force myself to resist or be strong. I felt like a grown-up!” I invited both Angie and Eric to try this exercise a few times, imagining themselves in Charlie ’s presence when he started skid- ding into one of his storms, while picturing the steel cable giving them a strong backbone. “Remember, you do him no favors when you modify things to his liking. If you want your son to grow into an adult who can handle things when they don’t go his way, you will have to help him develop that muscle of resilience now by staying present with him as he experiences the full weight of his disappointments. “Go ahead and feel your heavy-heartedness as you accept that you cannot shield Charlie from every frustration or loss, and then picture yourself standing steady, with that cable anchoring you to the earth. Inhabit a gentle but unyielding strength as you acknowl- edge your son’s feelings with love, but allow him to move through his denial, anger, and bargaining so that he simply feels sad.” I worked with this family for about three months. We focused"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Growing Up While Raising Kids  on reducing their discomfort with Charlie ’s frustrations with- out feeling the constant need to manipulate things to his liking. We explored their fears about dampening his spirit, and looked at ways they could more confidently deal with his fiery temper- ament. I helped them learn how to communicate with Charlie in ways that left him feeling understood, even if he couldn’t have what he wanted. Instead of “No, you can’t have cookies for din- ner” ( no being a very triggering word for most children), I showed them how to respond in a less confrontational way to at least some his requests. “Cookies for dinner! Wouldn’t that be fun! Should we try that for your next birthday?” And both Angie and Eric made more time to simply be present with their son so that he experienced the kind of closeness and connection he craved, and that would help him want to behave better and please his parents. The Pitfalls of Parental Guilt Things settled down with Angie and Eric. However, one issue still needed to be addressed: parental guilt and shame. As I shared suggestions with them about how to work with Charlie, they responded with comments like, “I should have known that” or “We ’ve probably ruined our son for- ever.” This didn’t surprise me; I’ve worked with parents for decades and am well familiar with the tendency we have to beat up on ourselves when we fail to live up to our idealized standards. But I also know how harmful it is to allow that critical voice in our heads to gov- ern our actions and feelings. Doing so not only hurts us, but in a roundabout way, it also puts pressure on our children to behave well so that we can feel good about ourselves and keep guilt and shame at bay. Allowing that critical voice in our heads to govern our actions and feelings not only hurts us but also puts pressure on our children to behave well so that we can feel good about ourselves and keep guilt and shame at bay."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence This was something we had to work hard on. I shared with Eric and Angie my experience of taking on that judging voice in my own head — the one that ran a constant narrative about how I was doing in any given moment or interaction. One of the great- est investments I have ever made has been in learning to stand up to that voice — through therapy, EMDR (Eye Movement Desen- sitization and Reprocessing), meditation, and prayer. But it is a process, not something accomplished overnight or by simply set- ting an intention to be more positive. One day I was in my closet and something slipped out of my hands. Right away, a voice in my head — an old voice — said, “Oh, brother! You’re so clumsy!” Instantly, another voice chimed in with, “You don’t get to talk to Susan that way!” I was thrilled to see that I had so internalized the work I’d been doing about being “good enough” that it had finally become part of me. While there are plenty of areas in which I still have much work to do, I have come to accept that I will make mistakes and lose my cool or my patience. As long as I can own those moments without letting my ego blame others or build justifications, I can allow my imperfec- tions to be part of what makes me human. Eric and Angie had their work cut out for them, but they were committed to learning how to stop allowing their harsh and crit- ical inner voices to sabotage the healthier approaches they were taking with their son, giving themselves permission to have stum- bles and setbacks. This part of the work was lovely — watching them relax and make peace with just doing their best. It was also inspiring to see them step more fully into a place of trusting that if they owned up to their shortcomings with Charlie, legitimized his feelings, and apologized as needed, they could stop turning every challenging parenting moment into a test of their spiritual mettle."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Growing Up While Raising Kids  Our Own Growing Pains Sometimes we hesitate to set limits with our kids because we ’re afraid of them; their tantrums are so scary or exhausting that we tiptoe around them to avoid triggering their upset.

And then there are times when we neglect to fully own the role of Captain because we are ambiva- lent about becoming a card-carrying grown-up. Raising children catapults us into adulthood — or at least it offers us the opportunity to grow up, if we are ready and willing. But it can be something of a shock to realize just how responsible we need to be once we become parents. One day, when my son was a baby and had just started eating regular meals, I fed him breakfast. I soon found myself thinking about what he would be having for lunch a few hours later. My first thought was to look around the room for the adult who would be taking care of things like this — the legitimately grown-up person who would be arranging regular breakfasts, lunches, and dinners. Before kids, my husband and I had been casual about mealtimes, throwing something together for ourselves at the last minute without a lot of thought or planning. As it dawned on me that I was going to be responsible for feeding this child three meals a day for the next eighteen years, I was gobsmacked! Frankly, I didn’t see myself as being that mature or together. But the truth was, when I had a baby, the decision to step all the way into adulthood had more or less been made for me. I had to catch up to the reality that I was the grown-up in the room and that I might as well step fully into that role. If we are actors on the stage of life, we might as well dress the part!

And I didn’t have to lose my playful or spontaneous side, as I had feared. Children are born helpless and dependent. Mother Nature has instilled within parents a fierce urge to ensure their children’s sur- vival so that they can eventually negotiate life without their par- ents’ protection. Kids naturally poke and prod against the limits we set to figure out where the end posts are in their world; otherwise they are at risk of venturing further and further off the map. Establishing boundaries helps us raise children who know how to han- dle disappointment and who are therefore strong, adaptable, and self-reliant. This is one of the grand prizes of parenting: seeing our chil- dren enter their adult lives capable of navigating life ’s inevitable ups and downs with confidence. That is when we know that the effort we made to grow up ourselves , while becoming loving stew- ards of our children, was worth all those growing pains — our children’s and our own.

How does that fit in with taking that authoritarian role you are suggesting? suggestion: For my birthday last year, my son’s gift to me was a letter he had written about his childhood, thanking me for help- ing him grow into the man he is and is becoming.

It is not easy to establish boundaries or to disappoint our kids, but perhaps like me you will come to see that it isn’t about whether or not we are spiritual equals with our children; that goes without saying. It ’s about the fact that we have a duty and obliga- tion to fully inhabit the grown-up role to the best of our ability. This might require being present with our uneasiness or discom- fort about our children’s anger toward us.

Your blood pressure begins to rise. How could they be so irresponsible! As you rouse yourself and look for the offending skipper, you discover . . . there isn’t one!

Only your thoughts about the event. You realized that the boat ramming into yours was not piloted by someone intending you harm. It wasn’t personal after all. Choose to see your son’s misbehavior as something other than a desire to offend or upset you. He may be tired or hungry or feeling shortchanged on attention. Or perhaps he is worried about something at school, or just out of sorts. Even if your son is delib- erately yanking your chain, you can look beneath that motivation to see his behavior as a clumsy way of getting one of his needs met rather than something done maliciously. One of the greatest gifts you can give yourself is allowing yourself to move through life without taking other people ’s behav- ior personally. A tornado doesn’t deliberately rip apart a house; the house just happened to be in its path.

It is common for it to take a little time to find your sweet spot when it comes to inhabiting the role as Captain of the ship without sacrificing the pleasure of enjoying life with your kids. In time you will become more comfortable setting limits when they are needed and appropriate, for example, when your kids want to play with matches or jump off the roof. Eckhart Tolle tells a funny story of passing by a school that had just closed for summer vacation and had posted a big sign saying Be Safe! As he thought about this parting advice for stu- dents heading into their holidays, he laughed as he imagined the children returning from vacation at the start of the next school year. Eckhart said, “The most successful student will say, ‘I was very, very safe over the holidays!’ ” Clearly, we want our kids to be careful and to explore the world and have fun. My recommendation is this: When faced with a decision about whether to be flexible or firm with your children, pause and check in with yourself. Tune in to what your instincts tell you is the best course of action. Trust yourself. Stand in your Captain role with confidence. You don’t have to become your mother or come across like an army sergeant. If it ’s a good day to have ice cream for breakfast or announce a Stay in Your Pajamas All Day holiday, by all means, do that! The last thing I want is for parents to read my books and think they have to stop being goofy and lighthearted with their children. Don’t forget: although ship captains exude confidence and know how to navigate stormy seas, they also take passengers for a twirl around the dance floor!

One mother told me that the greatest yearning of her life was to have just one night of uninterrupted sleep. As much as we aspire to move consciously through our par- enting days, being responsible for the care and feeding of a child doesn’t erase our personhood or do away with our needs, moods, or desires. We long to read for hours or go to the bathroom without an au- dience. Naturally, we feel resentful at times. There are going to be moments when we lose our cool. Some days we say things we wish we hadn’t. That is just the way it is. The trick isn’t making the unpleasant experi- ences go away; it is making peace with them. Snapshot Child Syndrome In Parenting Without Power Struggles I introduced the idea that we have a hard time accepting our child not because of her problem- atic behaviors but because we compare our real, 3 -D child with The trick isn’t making the unpleasant experiences go away; it is making peace with them."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Throw Away the Snapshot  what I refer to as our Snapshot Child. The Snapshot Child says, “Sure, Mom!” when we ask her to take out the trash, while the real child lets out a groan. Our Snapshot Child says, “Thanks for reminding me!” when we ask him to start his homework, while the real one, in a trance in front of the TV, acts as though we don’t exist. Our Snapshot Children lovingly get along with one another, sharing toys, hugs, and the last piece of cake. Their real counterparts — well, I think you get the picture. As frustrating as it is when our child doesn’t match up to who we would like him to be, we don’t lose our cool because he is annoying or uncooperative. We lose it because we think he shouldn’t be annoying or uncooperative. In other words, our difficulty in being fully present with whatever is going on with our children is fueled by the mismatch between our Snapshot Child — who exists only in our imagination — and the real flesh-and-blood one in front of us. We move into Lawyer or Dictator mode not because our child “makes us” by misbehaving but because of a story — a “thought pill” we swallow — that negatively influences us. That upsetting story is then magnified by an army of inner attorneys who enthusiastically build a case to justify our grievances. If you find yourself thinking, Jeffrey should help out around the house more cheerfully, the team of lawyers in your head will eagerly provide evidence to support that belief, tossing in thoughts like, He only cares about himself! I even have to nag him to pick up his towel off the bathroom floor! These stories and beliefs are only neutralized when we explore why our child ’s upsetting behavior makes its own kind of sense: Our difficulty in being fully present with whatever is going on with our children is fueled by the mismatch between our Snapshot Child — who exists only in our imagination — and the real flesh-and-blood one in front of us."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence Jeffrey should not cheerfully help out around the house . . . because he’s a surly teen who is in the midst of heaping doses of peer problems . Or Jeffrey should resist my demands that he help out . . . because I come at him with irritation and sarcasm. When we view our child — and our life — from a wider perspective, we become better able to line up with reality instead of fighting it. If we need to make changes, we can respond from strength rather than reacting from desperation. Freeing ourselves from Snapshot Child syndrome means that we stop pushing away reality, acknowledging our resistance and allowing it to move through. As speaker and writer Byron Katie humorously says, “When you argue with reality, you lose. But only 100 % of the time.” Just as we might struggle to accept the child we have — pre- ferring the Snapshot Child to the real one — we may also strug- gle to accept the day to day realities of life with children, which may bear little resemblance to what we imagined it would be like. But therein lies a golden opportunity for stretching and growing. For some, it ’s little things: We didn’t imagine joining the PTA, but when we give it a try we discover an unexpected sense of camaraderie as we help out at a bake sale. Or maybe we ’re staunch pacifists and end up with a child who is fascinated with weapons. Lo and behold, we find ourselves throwing our heart and soul into a game of laser tag with our son and his buddies. When we remain inflexible instead of embracing reality, we run the risk of missing out on some terrific experiences. Growing versus Grumbling Nearly all of us face some mismatch between our idealized Snap- shot Life and the reality we ’re living. For some, that snapshot is of a smiling mom and grinning dad surrounded by cheery kids and the family dog; reality might be an acrimonious divorce and"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Throw Away the Snapshot  an awful custody arrangement. For others, the snapshot might be of a posse of noisy children tumbling through the house. Real- ity could be a child with a disability, confined to a wheelchair. Another parent might have imagined a life of ease with vacations on the lake and private school for the kids. Economic down- turns might instead have left the family in dire straits, crammed into a tiny apartment in a part of town they had assiduously avoided. Seldom can we control our lives so effectively that we ’re spared unexpected plot twists. Human life brings with it count- less opportunities to either resist or adapt. I’ve watched people in identical circumstances — serious illness, addiction, foreclo- sure — assume radically different attitudes about their life sit- uations. Those who resist might suffer for years, angry at God, their former spouse, or their parents for “making them” deal with challenges they didn’t sign up for. Others make peace with what is about their life, stepping into it with humility, acceptance, and appreciation for the smallest moments of brightness. To grow from rather than grum- bling about the mismatch between our idealized snapshots and our real life requires a lot of letting go. Hundreds of times a day we are offered the chance to make friends with a difficult moment rather than gritting our teeth as we endure it. It all comes down to micro choices — the tiny, moment-to-moment decisions we make about how to approach what is in front of us. Sometimes what ’s in front of us is baby poop dripping down our leg. My friend Elisha tells the story of being trapped on an overseas flight with his baby, who — to put it delicately — had a stomach issue. The flight would have been a lot easier if he and Hundreds of times a day we are offered the chance to make friends with a difficult moment rather than gritting our teeth as we endure it."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence his wife had brought a few more packs of baby wipes. “I had to decide to just be present with what was happening in the moment, even while the contents of my son’s smelly diaper leaked onto my one pair of clean pants. Funny enough, by not resisting what was happening, and by keeping my sense of humor, I found joy in the midst of that craziness! My wife and I were cracking up about the whole thing.” It ’s not hard to imagine an alternative version of that story along the lines of, “You won’t believe what I had to endure on that flight! It was hell — the worst nine hours of my life!” Time and again I am awed by the patience and grace I have witnessed as parents release their attachment to their Snapshot Life in favor of their actual one, even when faced with a tremen- dous hardship, such as a child with a serious illness. You might say, “Those parents have no choice,” but they do; we all have a choice, every moment: Will I resist what ’s in front of me and live with bitterness and frustration, or will I align my body, mind, and spirit with the way things are, allowing myself to be at peace? Of course, none of this means we should avoid doing what- ever we can to create change when it is called for; I do not advo- cate passively letting life roll over us. But as the saying goes, what you resist, persists. While there ’s much to be said for having a vision board or a clear image of the life we want to create, we need to throw away the snapshot of what should be happening so that we can enjoy life with the children and circumstances in front of us, as they are. Grieving for Your Old Life After having led a serene, prechild life that included dance classes five days a week and a regular painting workshop, Sylvie felt adrift in a sea of demanding children. “I feel cut off from the very"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Throw Away the Snapshot  things that fed my soul,” she confessed, “even though I love my kids with all my heart.” Like Angie and Eric, she was wracked with guilt over vio- lating the “shoulds” of parenthood. “It ’s so much harder than I thought it would be. I know all the things I should feel — love, gratitude, delight — and I do feel those things some of the time. But my husband works very long hours, and I’m left on my own with an oppositional toddler and a bossy four-year-old. I feel like parts of me are dying. I find myself constantly checking my Facebook page to see what my friends are up to, trying to stay connected to a world outside of potty training and Barney. I feel terrible about how much I check out, removing myself emotion- ally when I’m with my children: There, but not there .” Although Sylvie and I talked about the importance of making time to do things she loved, it was clear that just taking a few dance classes was not going to eliminate her resistance to the demands of her day- to-day life. I suspected that making peace with her current life was going to require her to grieve for the one she had had to let go of. Without doing that work, she would remain trapped in the in-between space — no longer living the life she inhabited before she had children but not fully available for the one that she was living now. Parenting from this partially pres- ent state is a recipe for child-rearing challenges; when kids sense our halfheartedness, they will do whatever is required to bring all of us into the room, even if it means tantrums, aggression, or defiance. I told Sylvie, “The only way to neutralize your grievances about life with children is to grieve. And this will require turning Parenting from a partially present state is a recipe for child-rearing challenges; when kids sense our halfheartedness, they will do whatever is required to bring all of us into the room, even if it means tantrums, aggression, or defiance."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence toward your feelings, even if your instinct is to turn away from them.” I invited Sylvie to quiet herself and tune in to the feelings underneath her resistance. She told me, “I feel resentful and trapped. It ’s like I’m shut down or suffocating — and then I feel ashamed for feeling that way. After all, I wanted to have children; it isn’t their fault that they have needs or can’t give me the stimulation I get from the outside world.” I asked her to stay present with what she felt, without slipping into her head about what was going on. “What does that feeling remind you of, Sylvie? How is it familiar — that sense of being trapped or shut down?” She stayed quiet for a few minutes, and then responded, “I know this feeling. It ’s like being a child who wanted more than anything to dance and be imaginative, and I wasn’t allowed to do those things. Dance classes were out of the question in my family, and schoolwork took forever because I had an imaginative mind that didn’t want to be bothered with boring assignments. I felt . . . trapped.” Exploring this led Sylvie to uncover a deep sadness over being raised by parents who were invested in trying to change who she was. Her parents were well-intentioned; as first-genera- tion immigrants, they had made enormous sacrifices to raise their children in a country that offered opportunities for education and financial success they could only have dreamed of. But Sylvie was a very right-brained, creative child whose passion was in express- ing herself through movement and art. Like all children, one of her greatest needs was to feel celebrated and cherished, as is, by her parents. She needed to know that she was a delight to them — that who she was was enough. “It is profoundly wounding to a youngster to feel that they are a disappointment to those they"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Throw Away the Snapshot  most love,” I told her. “It ’s like being told that there ’s something wrong with your size-seven feet because they won’t fit into the size-six shoes you’re being told you should be able to wear. “This wound — this longing to be free to express your unique qualities and interests — may be fueling some of the frustration you feel now with your children, since you have to tamp down your own interests to take care of your kids each day. It makes sense to me that you would feel resentful; it is, in fact, a big loss — letting go of the things that brought you a sense of joy and aliveness while taking on the mundane tasks of parenting.” In my sessions with Sylvie over the next few weeks I focused on helping her go deeper with her unresolved feelings about being forced to be who she wasn’t in her early years. I encouraged her to acknowledge and allow space for her feelings, being present for the sensations in her body associated with them — heaviness, constriction, trembling — without checking out or slipping into a mental narrative about what she was experiencing. As Sylvie stayed still and present to what she felt when she visited her sadness, the painful emotions began to lessen in inten- sity. She was surprised that by allowing herself to experience the feelings buried beneath her resistance and resentment, she could begin to move into a very kind and loving place — toward herself as well as her children. As this transformation happened, Sylvie softened; in fact, her whole demeanor seemed more relaxed. A few weeks after we began, Sylvie shared this with me: “I don’t quite know how it happened, but I’m finding myself much more patient with my kids — enjoying the little moments more. I’m less interested in switching on my phone to see what ’s going on in the ‘real world ’ and more engaged with the things going on with my children. It ’s amazing how not hiding from my resistance is liberating me from it!”"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence When Anger Unleashes Anger At times I am astonished by how quickly a client ’s long-repressed, unresolved feelings come to the surface when she is ready to face them. Cecilia was the mother of a five-year-old daughter and an eighteen-month-old son. Describing herself as gentle- natured, she scheduled a phone session with me because she be- came enraged when her daughter expressed anger. “As a child, I wasn’t allowed to get angry. I want my daughter to know that she can express her upset, but when she does, I become furious.” I asked if a part of her felt that her daughter was breaking a rule — kids shouldn’t be angry — when she got mad . She admitted that she did feel that way. When I suggested that it might also bring up feelings about the fact that while she had to bury her upsets as a child, her daughter was being permitted to express them, she agreed. It wasn’t easy to reconcile the double stan- dard she was facing — wanting it to be okay for her daughter to embrace unpleasant emotions that she herself had been required to suppress. I invited her to simply sit with her anger, allowing it to be there without judging it. “Where in your body do you feel it? Describe the sensations to me.” “It ’s like a panic. I feel it in my stomach, and my feet feel like they want to move — like I want things to go faster. Like I want to escape.” She went on to say that she also felt her face tighten, as though she was concentrating intensely — trying to make some- thing happen. “Don’t get caught up in analyzing it. Just stay with what ’s going on and see if any other feelings are there, too, such as sad- ness, or fear, or longing.” As soon as I said this, she said, “Yes, sadness. And longing . . .” She began sobbing; I could feel the depth of sorrow around whatever was being stirred up."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Throw Away the Snapshot  I remained quiet, letting her know that I was present with a few words here and there, while trying not to intrude on her process. She described the longing as a black hole. “I can sense it ’s there but it is so big I can’t reach it because I know I can’t . . . have what it wants.” As a child she told me she was not allowed to cry or to want things. And in spite of her parents and brothers expressing anger routinely, she was forbidden to do so. “I would be spanked and told to go to my room until I could be a ‘good ’ girl again. I stayed there as long as I could, hot with anger but trying to numb it. I was a girl, and girls were expected to be quiet and good, and not make any trouble.” “It is so courageous of you, Cecilia, to stay with this grief and give it room. Thank you for being so brave.” As her crying quieted, she told me that she almost never cries. I think she was surprised by how quickly those old feelings came to the surface when she gave them space. In our conversation afterward, I explained that she was not the only one who would benefit from allowing these emotions to be experienced; her daughter would as well. “Anger is just the outward manifestation of hurt. It ’s likely that you are going to find yourself getting less angry with your daughter as you let the sadness have its say.” I also told her that by traveling this road, she would be better able to help her daughter move into her own sorrow when she becomes frustrated rather than lashing out in rage. The next time we met, Cecilia told me that a new world had opened up for her as a result of that single breakthrough. She said she had no idea she could be less reactive. “Even my husband has noticed a calmness in my voice.” But it was difficult to say no to her daughter, and she still got upset when her daughter defiantly said it to her. We talked about where that terror of standing her"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence ground had come from. I asked her to say no aloud a few times — not as a plea, but as an announcement. “I can feel it like a big pressure or energy in my belly, but I can’t get it out. It ’s like I’m choking on that feeling.” I didn’t rush her. She started to cry. And then I heard her “No!” It was tenta- tive but powerful, and behind it was a torrent of tears. As her no got a little stronger, Cecilia cried and cried. At the end of our session, she was much lighter. We laughed about how perfect it was that she had such a feisty, strong-willed daughter. I said, “Isn’t it something, Cecilia, how the universe works? It didn’t send you a meek and mild child; it sent you a strong one — one who can say, ‘Here is what it sounds like to stand up for yourself, Mommy!’ so you could clean up these old feelings around having needs, knowing it ’s okay to express them.” As discussed, our children often catalyze tremendous healing within us, if we turn difficult experiences with them into opportunities to give old feelings room to breathe. Such was the case with Cecilia, whose will- ingness to heal painful wounds from her past left me inspired by her courage. In the previous two examples, both women’s resistance to the “what is” of their parenting lives had been strongly influenced by unfinished business from their childhoods. I want to note that while it is always good to look to the past for clues if we are expe- riencing significant emotional reactivity to our present-day lives, I am not advocating that we blame mom and dad for all our woes, or that we disregard the influence of current stressors. Tension in a marriage, business-related difficulties, economic challenges, and even hormonal imbalances can also contribute to resistance we may feel toward our children or our life. Our children often catalyze tremendous healing within us, if we turn difficult experiences with them into opportunities to give old feelings room to breathe."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Throw Away the Snapshot  Relying on Our Kids to Make Us Feel Good Resistance to the what is about our children also shows up when we view them as servants of our self-esteem, the means by which we feel better about ourselves. We may heap praise on our son when he scores the winning touchdown because we swell with pride from the admiring looks of other parents sitting in the bleachers. Or we might lavish attention on our daughter when she ’s polite to guests at the party, getting an ego boost when they remark on what a well-mannered little girl she is. There ’s nothing wrong with feeling pleasure when our child ’s talents or kind nature is recognized by others. But kids are exquisitely attuned to our feel- ings; they want our approval and they know the rules of the game for winning it. When we need them to be a particular way so that we can feel good, we create a wound because we are establishing conditions for our love and acceptance of them. Accepting the what is about our children allows us to recognize them as separate people with their own strengths and challenges. It doesn’t ask them to compensate for our insecurities. It doesn’t make them responsible for our feelings. It lets us accept their shortcomings without fear- ing we will lose value in the eyes of those we believe are judging us based on our children’s accomplishments. All this frees us from being ego driven, so that we can raise the children we have, as they are, with presence. Dysfunctional Acceptance as a Form of Resistance Acceptance also allows us to face rather than hide from any chal- lenges our children may be struggling with.

She knew that her son’s grades had been slipping, but she attributed this to ninth grade being a lot harder than middle school. When Luke came home from a party drunk, she scolded him but chose to believe his promise that it was his first and only time. “I hate the stuff, Mom.” When his friends showed up at their house furtively head- ing to Luke ’s room without making eye contact, she chalked it up to awkward teenage boy behavior. When she confronted her son about the smell of pot in his room, she believed him when he told her he didn’t touch the stuff and it was probably that weird incense he was burning. Two of Luke ’s teachers emailed her to say that he was at risk of failing out of his first semester in their classes. She lectured him about trying harder, but nothing changed. Luke started sleeping till noon on weekends; she told herself that it was normal for his age. In other words, she resisted the what is about her son, refusing to acknowledge that he might be tumbling toward a substance problem, depression, or academic issues that needed attention. Lisa wasn’t a bad or negligent mom; she cared very much about her son and wanted him to have a good life. But she refused to line up with reality, choosing to see him as the innocent, care- free little boy he had once been. Her resistance to the what is about Luke manifested in the form of something I have heard Eckhart Tolle call dysfunc- tional acceptance . Without considering that his behaviors might be pointing to issues that needed to be addressed, she accepted at face value her son’s expla- nations that he didn’t like alcohol, didn’t use pot, and that slipping grades and sleeping past noon were a normal teen phase. What seemed like acceptance was in reality a passive form of resistance, or hiding from the reality of her son’s behavior — a dysfunctional acceptance of reality.

We found that he was indeed struggling with depression around social problems, long-buried feelings about his parents’ divorce, and significant gaps in his math skills that left him in the dark about how to do the work. Luke had been trying to numb himself with pot, alcohol, and sleep. Lisa was shocked to find out how much trouble her son was in emotionally; she had chosen to look the other way, afraid of the guilt and sense of overwhelm she would have to face if her boy were genuinely in trouble. Stretching beyond Ourselves Rising to meet life as it is requires us to move through resis- tance in ways that might feel uncomfortable or even impossible. Every parent has stories about the ways they have had to stretch to accommodate the realities of parenting. Mine began the day I went into labor. I am a strong and resourceful person, but in some areas I can be kind of wimpy. For instance, I’m not one to push myself when it comes to exercise. If I do manage to get past my excuses and procrastination, I may take a leisurely bike ride, or stroll along the treadmill for a few minutes. The truth is, I’ve never been very good about pushing through what I believe to be my physical limits. So it was fairly soon after I went into labor, maybe after my fourth or fifth contraction, that I changed my mind about having a baby. Sure, I had been excited about the whole thing, but as things got serious, I decided that I wasn’t up to it after all!

This is what parenting does; it invites us to stretch beyond ourselves, move through resistance, and tap into inner resources we didn’t know we possessed. While every parent has endured challenges they might not have thought they could handle, parents often tell themselves that they can’t be that Captain who knows how to navigate real storms. Once the going gets rough, they lose faith in their ability to deal with a child ’s rage over a divorce or to cope with the magnitude of problems resulting from the discov- ery that their teen has a real drinking problem. So they look the other way. But it is in the challenging moments that we get to move through resistance and strengthen our dedication to parenting with presence. Remember, muscle building cannot take place without tearing down muscle fibers — this is called hypertro- phy. These microtears are what it takes to build muscle bulk. We grow ourselves up each time we listen without reacting when our child shares something that fills us with dread, teaching her that she does not have to hide the truth from us. We discover that we can respond sanely when she is hurting, rather than crumbling because of our own distress. These are the moments that shape us not only as parents but as people. By throwing away the snapshot, bravely facing real- ity, feeling our feelings, and challenging the stories that suggest the grass is greener (or the child easier) in some other, imagined world, we can arrive fully at the life in front of us, with the very children we have been given.

Breathing deeply and steadily, sit with the anger. Don’t try to analyze or talk yourself out of it, or make it more or less than it is. Just allow your feelings, without judging them as good or bad.

Being a parent doesn’t mean being a martyr, denying your own needs, or repressing your emotions. Get the support you need to move through your grief, and despite what you might think today, you and your children will come through intact on the other side of this loss. It may also help to identify the thoughts that influence you to define your current situation as grim. Pain is often generated by our beliefs and ideas about a circumstance rather than the sit- uation itself. When your mind propels you into the future (with imagined loneliness or fear) or into the past (where there is long- ing or anger), you are likely to suffer. But if you bring yourself fully into the present moment — noticing your breath coming in and out, paying attention to the sensation of the air on your skin — you may discover that in this moment , you are fine. Identify the thoughts that cause you pain, and understand that you are not obligated to believe them. If you are facing an actual problem right now, address it with focus and attention. But be vigilant about falling into a pattern of abandoning the present moment to be dragged into the past or future with stress-inducing thoughts. This is not meant to dimin- ish the loss you are facing, but only to help alleviate the extra burden of unhappiness your mind may be generating.

But I want the battles and arguments to stop! suggestion: My previous book was all about dealing with power struggles, so I will touch on only a few points here. The first is this: When we need something from our children, we tend to come at them rather than alongside them, which activates their defiance. Kids smell desperation and they wisely understand that they are not meant to be responsible for our happiness. Outside of a close and loving attachment — the basis of genuine authority in our children’s eyes — they are likely to push back when our inter- actions with them have the fragrance of neediness. It is human nature. I once heard someone say something very wise: He who is most attached to a particular outcome has the least amount of power. Compassionately acknowledge your grandson’s longing to postpone his chores or skip his shower with less investment in win- ning: “I know it ’s a thousand times more fun to play that game than to take a shower. And it must be even worse for me to show up, asking you to turn it off when you were almost ready to move to the next level.” As simplistic as it may sound, validating his feel- ings will help. I sometimes talk about relationships as having a pH value. In science, if a solution is too acidic, we don’t bring it back to neutral by removing acid; we add alkaline, or a base, to restore pH bal- ance. Similarly, when our relationships with others — spouses, children, grandchildren — are too acidic , we bring them back into balance by adding alkaline, which in my model means including more interactions that strengthen attachment. The fact that your grandson is not being raised by either of his parents also suggests that he may have deeper issues — anger, grief, sadness — that influence his chronic resistance. A young- ster who has been subjected to significant upheaval is familiar with feelings of powerlessness, prompting him to make extra"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Throw Away the Snapshot  efforts to exercise control in situations where he can. I trust that your grandson — and you — have had counseling and support to help him adjust to the change in his life circumstances, regardless of how much better it is for him to be in the loving care of you and your husband. Make sure your grandson has help off-loading pent-up feel- ings of frustration and loss. And work on fortifying attachment, effectively changing the “pH” of the relationship so that he is less inclined to dig in his heels whenever you make a request. For more on attachment, please see chapter 9 , or refer to Parenting Without Power Struggles. In The Art of War , Sun Tzu says, “Supreme excellence con- sists of breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting.” Avoid engaging in power struggles and arguments with your grandson. Instead, focus on building a connection that deepens his aware- ness that although you might prefer him to be more easygoing, you delight in him just as he is. Is it okay that I don’t always like my kids? question: I feel a lot of shame saying this, but I have a dirty little secret. Sometimes I don’t like my kids. I love them, but there are times when I just want to be left alone. In many ways I had to parent my mother, and I feel resentful that I always have to be “on” for my two children, even though I love them so much. I have meditated most of my life, and now it is hard to get even ten minutes alone. There are times when my kids are pounding on my bedroom door while I am trying to sit and meditate.

If you shy away from the moments when you aren’t thrilled to be a parent, you will only push your resentment underground, where it will leak out in the form of impatience, sarcasm, or withdrawal. Feel what you feel. It makes perfect sense that you would yearn for your prechild, unencumbered life. I can also remember times when I longed to be alone and meditate for a little while, only to hear that knock, knock, knocking on the door, accompa- nied by, “Momma! I need you!” And I recall hiding in the bath- room with a page-turner in the hopes that I might lose myself in the story the way I had enjoyed before becoming a mother. It is only by allowing ourselves to be present with whatever is going on that we can let feelings move through with grace. We are, alas, simply human. We each bring to parenting the trials and travails of our own childhoods, paired with our unique temperament and nature. Some parents get lost in the joy and magic of raising children, never once glancing over their shoul- der at the life they were living before their children arrived. But others step into the demands of parenting in fits and starts, doing their best to embrace the role but still haunted by a nagging uncer- tainty about whether they’re cut out for the job. And within all of us lives the small child who just wants to be on the receiving end of love, kindness, and support. When we include him or her in the care and presence we offer our children, we can generate deep healing for the wounded parts of ourselves. My advice is to be immensely patient with yourself, allowing whatever you feel to bubble up and be known. You may find it valuable to work with a therapist to move through some of the old feelings of resentment that are weighing you down. And when fam- ily life gets too chaotic, take a break!

In a couple of days he ’ll be graduating from college. I have come to notice that these important milestones in his life often trigger some kind of argument between us, probably part of the unconscious process of easing him further out of the nest. I am trying to explain why something he said pushed a but- ton, and he ’s having trouble understanding why that particular thing would be an issue. Finally I say, “You cannot know why that triggers me because you have never visited the planet where I grew up.” And he gets it. His face softens, his posture relaxes, and he offers a simple, “Wow.” In that moment, I understand that this is the essential ingredient in compassion: recognizing that even if we don’t understand why someone reacts the way she does, her history and truth are as real for her as ours is for us.

As I consider how he came to be this way, I know that some of his nature is simply what he came with; I think kids are born with certain temperaments and that Ari arrived with a gentle spirit. But I also believe that many if not most kids arrive similarly amiable and undefended, and that we have the chance to help them make their way in the world with strength that doesn’t overpower, compassion that soothes, and gentility that comforts. I did my best to help my son understand that he had been born into great privilege simply by virtue of the fact that we never had to worry about having a home to live in or food on the table. We traveled to parts of the world where he could get to know people from disadvantaged backgrounds whose happiness was not predicated on wealth or possessions. We volunteered in our community so he could interact with people who might look him in the eye and let him know that his small effort to make their lives better meant something to them. I tried to do the things for our neighbors and friends that human beings do as members of the same tribe or passengers on the same boat, believing that paying lip service to good personhood or writing a check to a charity is not the same as showing up. I made it a practice to notice the simple pleasures in our lives. The taste of lavender ice cream. Hearing a great joke. Lying in the grass at night, watching the stars.

Plenty of days saw me edgy, impatient, or lost in my own little world. I was by no means exemplary as a parent or per- son, slipping into Lawyer or Dictator mode more often than I’d care to admit. But I think I was good enough — an idea that frees us from attempting perfection, allowing us to simply do our best each day to inspire our children to do theirs. From the many late- night conversations Ari and I have had since he has stepped more fully into adulthood, I have discovered that my imperfections — coupled with acknowledgments and the fact that he continues to see me growing through my challenges — helped him develop a greater capacity to accept, forgive, and be imperfect himself. What follows are some thoughts about what we can do to help our kids head into their adult lives with a head start at being con- scious, present, joyful people — keeping in mind, of course, that they will eventually have to develop their own resources through the grit and tumble of their lives. Picturing Our Children as Adults When I was working on this book, I sat down to write in an out- door courtyard with chairs and couches scattered around the shops. I spotted a comfy sofa, but when I sat down, I saw that it was blanketed in crumbs. The table beside it was littered with used coffee cups and crumpled napkins. What a mess! I thought about the people who had left their trash behind. Had their par- ents demonstrated by their actions that it was okay to leave messes for other people to deal with? Many ingredients go into raising children to be conscious, resilient, and compassionate adults, including honesty, gratitude, responsibility — the list goes on. But we cannot simply teach these qualities through our words. Lecturing our kids about the importance of cleaning up after themselves or being kind to others means nothing if they watch us leave our cups and napkins behind"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence or hear us insult the waiter when she fails to take down our order correctly. Bringing up children to become peo- ple we like and admire requires us to at least try to live the qualities we want them to embody. As I mentioned earlier, when I begin a phone coaching session with a client, I usually start by asking this question: “If you feel better at the end of this call, what would have happened? What insight, strategy, or unresolved conflict would we have addressed? Picture yourself relieved or grateful when our time together is over, and let ’s talk about your issue with your desired outcome in mind.” I have found this to be an effective way to stay focused on what most needs to happen during our session. In that spirit, I invite you to participate in an exercise to help infuse more intentionality and awareness into your daily interac- tions with your children. Think about the person you want your youngster to be when he is a full-fledged grown-up. Picture him at twenty-five, forty-five, or sixty-five years old. Imagine him surrounded by a loving cadre of friends, passionately pursuing a career, delighting in creative pursuits, and/or enjoying his role as a partner, spouse, or parent. Consider the qualities your child possesses that make this rich, satisfying adult life within her reach. What attributes do you hope to instill within her that will ensure that she is excited to wake up every morning to greet a new day, equipped with the resilience she will need to survive life ’s disappointments? If you need ideas, call to mind a person you greatly admire. It may be someone you know personally, or it could be a celebrated individual whose life exemplifies the characteristics you most value. This person can be living or deceased; he or she can even be a fictional character.

Perhaps you are touched by the fact that he treats all those he encoun- ters with respect and thoughtfulness, regardless of their status or stature. Or maybe you find yourself inspired by his tenacity and willingness to push through obstacles. Maybe you love his energy — he brings a certain joie de vivre and lightness of spirit to everything he does. Or maybe, after interacting with this per- son, you always feel better about yourself, or about life in general. Use these ideas to help formulate a list of the traits you want to nurture that will help your child lead a wonderful life, long after she has flown the coop. Essential Ingredients for Raising a Caring, Confident Child How a child turns out is a function of an infinite number of vari- ables — temperament; genetics; the parenting they received; their physical, emotional, and psychological health; their opportunities for education; sibling relationships; the network of supportive people in their tribe. In other words, there are no formulas that guarantee a youngster will become a conscious, confident, caring adult. Many factors are out of our control. But what follows are some of the ways that we can influence our children to become fulfilled and joyful grownups. Keep in mind that even the most spiritually evolved people have been known to have had significant parenting problems, even while advising their followers on how to be more conscious and compassionate. There is no certificate or credential that ensures we ’ll show up as our most enlightened self every day or that we ’ll have kids who don’t have problems.

Each of us has blind spots, regardless of how much personal work we have done. But it is never too late to grow and to change. And from what I have seen, nothing propels our evolution quite like raising children. When we consider the characteristics that are important to instill in our children, we might say that we want them to be con- fident and respectful, resourceful and kind, resilient and respon- sible; the list is long, and we will discuss some of these traits in the pages that follow. But when most parents are asked what they want most for their children in preparation for their adulthood, they begin by saying, “I just want them to be happy.” And here is where things get interesting. While there are many qualities that we can and should nurture in our children, there is one without which all other attributes become significantly less important: we need to raise our children to know they are inherently worthy of love and happiness so that they will be able to absorb all the good that comes their way. We live in a time of unprecedented options for enjoyment and amusement: movies, music, video games, shopping malls, and of course diversions such as Facebook and other online worlds. The array of possibilities for “having fun” are only as limited as one ’s imagination. And yet more teenagers and young adults die from suicide than from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, stroke, pneu- monia, influenza, and chronic lung disease combined. Every day, more than 5 , 400 suicide attempts are made by young people in grades seven through twelve. And the suicide rate for middle-aged Americans has risen sharply; according to the Centers for Disease We need to raise our children to know they are inherently worthy of love and happiness so that they will be able to absorb all the good that comes their way."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"We Aren’t Raising Children, We’re Raising Adults  Control, from 1999 to 2010 , the number of Americans ages thirty- five to sixty-four rose by nearly 30 percent. Clearly, the dots aren’t connecting. If we have greater-than- ever access to enjoyment, why aren’t more of us feeling good? Unless an individual has created space internally to experience love and joy each day, she will move through life Teflon coated, unable to be touched by the gifts attempting to come her way. It ’s sort of like owning a helicopter but not having a landing pad for it. We need to help our children develop the capacity to feel they are worthy of love and happiness so that they will be capa- ble of receiving it, in all its forms, when they grow up. Helping our children become accustomed to being loved and enjoying the sweetness of life is the greatest contribution we can make to their future happiness. This is no small task. It is a lifelong journey to carve out room within ourselves to receive all the goodness of life. In his beautiful book Perfect Love, Imperfect Relationships , John Welwood writes of the core wound we each carry within our hearts — the lack of belief in our inherent lovability or our right to be seen and cherished as we are. “Not knowing, in our blood and bones, that we are truly loved or lovable under- mines our capacity to give and receive love freely. This is the core wound that generates interpersonal conflict and a whole range of familiar relationship tangles. Difficulty trusting, fear of being misused or rejected, harboring jealousy and then vindictiveness, defensively stone-walling, having to argue and prove we ’re right, feeling eas- ily hurt or offended and blaming others for our pain — these are just a few of the ways that our insecurity about being loved or lovable shows up.” So it is our challenge and opportunity to foster in our children It is a lifelong journey to carve out room within ourselves to receive all the goodness of life."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence the living, breathing knowledge that they are worthy — as is — of being loved. No parent remains consistently attuned to his child. We can- not always know what she needs or muster the energy to respond in a satisfying way. We get tired and impatient. We find ourselves distracted, stressed, or out of sorts. We may have an especially difficult child who wears us out with unreasonable demands. We are, alas, merely human, struggling with our own challenges and destined to fail in meeting our chil- dren’s needs again and again. Frankly, it wouldn’t even be good for our kids if we were perfectly tuned in to them. Imagine the expectations they would bring to their later-in-life friendships or marriages if our children expected every desire or need to be fulfilled by others. Donald Winnicott, a British psychoanalyst, talked about the importance of simply being a “good enough mother” after realizing that babies and children actually benefited when their caregivers periodically failed to meet their needs, allowing them to develop resilience. Starting in infancy, children do their best to make sense of the world in order to feel safe in it. They imagine their caregivers to be infallible so that they can trust in their ability to provide for and protect them. If a little one is being raised by a parent who rarely responds lovingly and appropriately to his physical or emotional needs, he will not think to himself, “Oh, Mommy is probably stressed from her long day at work. I know she loves me but she is just tired or distant because she has unresolved emo- tional issues.” Instead, the child concludes that Mommy isn’t responding to his needs either because he is unworthy or because there is something inherently wrong with him.

He heads into adulthood guarded, less trusting, disconnected from his heart, and therefore less available to receive all of life ’s goodness. Like the child with his nose pressed against the window of the candy shop, this kind of person may yearn for all the delec- table things inside, believing at his core that they are meant to be enjoyed by others but not him. He might blame his wife, his boss, or his unfair life circumstances for not delivering what he longs to have, when in fact even if everything he dreamed of landed in his lap, he would still be unable to enjoy it. Our kids deserve to know that even if we can’t always meet their needs or offer them the validation they long for, they are still wholly lovable and uniquely brilliant just as they are. This instills in them the consciousness that they are worthy of being loved and happy, positioning them to receive the wonderful things life has in store for them rather than conditioning them to push those things away. What can we do? It ’s not compli- cated. When we aren’t able to be there for our child in the way she wants, we can minimize the harm by simply acknowledging her disappointment. “You were really hoping I could spend time with you, and here I am again with the baby.” “I am sorry I was cranky — I had a tough day at work today, and I guess I got really tired — it was not your fault.” “It ’s hard having to go to bed when we were having so much fun together.” This helps prevent the possibility that she will come away from disappointment believing she is unworthy of attention because of an inherent defect.

We know that treating others respectfully is essential to getting along in life. But we sometimes forget that to truly respect another person, we must fi rst respect ourselves. It may sound obvious and perhaps even a little clichéd, but I believe that genuine self-respect (as opposed to ego-driven, foot-stomping, “I demand to be listened to!” behavior) is not easy to develop. It starts by enjoying our own company and includes caring for our- selves with kindness, trusting our instincts, and pursuing the things that give our life meaning. Only then are we able to authentically respect others in how we communicate, empathize, handle dis- agreements, and honor our agreements.

They were simply being asked to sit for between six and fifteen minutes without falling asleep. In one of these experiments, par- ticipants were given a mild shock — a light, static electricity jolt — before they entered the room where they would be doing their quiet sitting. After they received the shock, nearly every subject reported that it was so unpleasant they would agree to pay five dollars to avoid receiving it again. However, in one of these studies, after having once endured the shock and subsequent six to fifteen minutes of time sitting alone in the room, 67 percent of the men and 25 percent of the women actually requested a second shock if it would excuse them from having to complete the full “thinking period.” They pre- ferred being zapped to the prospect of sitting for six to fifteen min- utes alone with themselves. My goodness! A few years ago I was driving a friend ’s three-year-old home in their family’s SUV. When the car started, the video she had been watching resumed playing. I was surprised but said nothing. In my day (which makes me sound much older than I am), the idea that my son would watch a screen while we drove would have been absurd. Why would you want to look at a screen when there is so much to see out the window? But when this little girl’s show ended, she immediately started crying. “Put on another one! I want to see another one!” I suggested that she might have fun looking out the window at the cars or the people going by. She was having none of it. Poor thing — at three, she had already been conditioned to need some kind of electronic stimulation to tolerate car rides.

(Frankly, it has left parents reeling over how much they should be on their devices as well!) Children need to play. They need the tactile touch of gooey finger paint rather than the sanitary experience of brushing their fingers across a touch pad to make color magically appear on a screen. They need to dig in the dirt, and get dirty. They need to splash in water and get wet. They need to make music and climb trees. They need to wander aimlessly from room to room without an organized activity to occupy them. The Forest schools in Scandina- via were built on the premise that children learn best by doing and by being outdoors. Kindergar- teners spend their entire two and a half hours outside. Unless temperatures drop below 20 degrees, I’m told that even children attending the Forest school in the Arctic Circle are outside play- ing and learning — with miner’s lamps on their heads!

Little today in our hectic lives provides for opportunities to attune with one another. This doesn’t mean that kids should be prevented from watch- ing TV or using computers. I am not advocating that we raise a generation of Luddites. The digital era has brought countless benefits into our lives. But given the limitless stimulation offered by electronic devices and the potential exposure to things that are entirely inappropriate, it is crucial that we engage our children early in conversations about using these gadgets so that as they move into the independence of adolescence and are less under our influence, they will be able to make intelligent choices. Like us, they will have to figure out how to balance their plugged-in life with their unplugged one. I will be sharing more suggestions for how to manage that challenging balancing act as we proceed. Hitting the Off Switch One day a mother and her twelve-year-old son were having a heated argument in my office about time spent on his devices. Elena complained that her son refused to get off the iPad unless she forced him to by threatening to take it away altogether. “He ignores his chores, procrastinates on homework, and wouldn’t dream of going outside to play.” She said the hardest time was when she was making dinner; Christopher typically got on one device or another while she was occupied in the kitchen and therefore less able to follow through with limits. Chris main- tained that his mom was far too strict. “She ’s so much meaner than my friends’ parents. They get to be on the iPad for hours!” I let him air his complaints so that he would be receptive to my input. “There ’s nothing to do that ’s fun at my house! And I get"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Modeling Self-Love and Awareness  my homework done. I don’t see why she can’t let me play my games. I’m not bothering anybody!” Instead of trying to force Chris to embrace the merits of old-fashioned play or convince him that until recently kids man- aged to enjoy their childhoods quite nicely without the existence of iPads or computers, I invited the two of them to do a visu- alization with me. “Close your eyes, and imagine that the three of us are in the exact same spot we ’re sitting in now, but it ’s ten thousand years ago. There are no buildings or furniture, no cars or electricity. Chris, imagine your mom working around the fire with the other women of the tribe, preparing dinner — maybe grinding seeds or dropping in some of the herbs that you gathered earlier with her. Now, Christopher, I want you to picture yourself in that setting, a young man of the tribe. What are you doing? See yourself there and picture what you’re doing while you wait for the meal.” I let him have some quiet time and then invited them both to open their eyes. “So, Chris, what were you up to, back when there weren’t any devices?” He said he had pictured himself running around with the other boys, building things, and climbing trees. Elena chimed in, offering that she had imagined him helping the men — who were not that much older than he was — preparing weapons for their next hunt or building a hut. He smiled as we talked about life back then. “I wish I could live like that now! It was cool!” I was reminded of how challenging it actually is for kids these days, now that opportunities to explore the great outdoors or spend time out in the wild are so rare. I said as much to Elena, inviting her to see her son’s situa- tion from his vantage point. “Life is different now. It ’s hard to resist the temptation to switch on a device when you can’t roam the great outdoors.” His mom nodded, acknowledging the many restrictions of their daily life — including living on a busy city"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence street where it was unsafe to wander too far. “Chris, would you be willing to make a list of at least ten fun things you could do that didn’t require electricity?” He was surprised by how quickly he was able to come up with ideas, with his mom enthusiastically tossing in possibilities. Elena agreed to help him implement some of the activities on his list, such as getting materials for soap carv- ing or building a small fort in their backyard. The session ended with Chris and his mom feeling more like allies than adversaries. This exercise didn’t eradicate Christopher’s love affair with his iPad and video games, but it did help him find something else to do when his mother asked him to turn things off. This issue will probably continue to be a challenge, because, as he said, most of Christopher’s friends have fewer restrictions, and he wants to be part of their online culture. But once Elena was clear, and invested a little time into providing some interesting alternatives, the nego- tiations tapered off. Steve Jobs’s Kids and the iPad Many parents justify giving their kids carte blanche when it comes to digital devices because they believe that not doing so will cause their children to fall behind in a competitive world where the tech savvy prevail. In his article “Steve Jobs Was a Low-Tech Par- ent,” Nick Bilton began with a question he posed to Mr. Jobs as the first tablets were being marketed. “So, your kids must love the iPad?” Jobs’s response? “They haven’t used it. . . . We limit how much technology our kids use at home.” Bilton spoke with Walter Isaacson, author of Steve Jobs, who spent a lot of time at their home and said, “Every evening Steve made a point of hav- ing dinner at the big long table in their kitchen, discussing books and history and a variety of things. No one ever pulled out an iPad or computer.” Chris Anderson, former editor of Wired and chief executive"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Modeling Self-Love and Awareness  of 3 D Robotics, puts time limits as well as parental controls on all the devices in his family’s home. “My kids accuse me and my wife of being fascists and overly concerned about tech, and they say that none of their friends have the same rules,” he said of his five children, ages six to seventeen. “That ’s because we have seen the dangers of technology firsthand. I’ve seen it in myself. I don’t want to see that happen to my kids.” Rule number one? “There are no screens in the bedroom. Period. Ever.” When our guidelines are clear, children adapt. They may push and prod to have more of what they want, but once the power is switched off, they will find something fun to do, just as children have done since time immemorial. When I was in West Africa several years ago, I was curious about how people there were using social media. I asked a num- ber of sixteen- to twenty-four-year-olds if they would ever con- sider being on their computers, perhaps on Facebook, at the same time that their friend was in the room, visiting with them. They always laughed at this idea. “That ’s very funny! Why would I want to be on my computer talking to my friend if she is here with me?” But in many homes, that is exactly how kids hang out with one another — texting, chatting, taking selfies, or showing one another posts and videos on the screens in front of them instead of just enjoying each other’s company. Comedian Louis C. K. did a hilarious piece on our growing obsession with our devices, joking about how parents no longer actually watch their children at their musical recital but instead solemnly hold their cell phones out in front of their faces to video the performance so they can post the footage on Facebook or YouTube where, truth be told, no one else cares to watch it.

Leading by Example There is, of course, another piece we must discuss when talking about raising children who are comfortable being with them- selves. We have to show them what that looks like. Most of us move at a frenetic pace throughout our day, hardly stopping to sit for a meal, let alone to gaze out the window or daydream. The beeps, the tweets, the pings, the rings — we have developed Pavlov- ian responses to the alerts our devices deliver, often dropping whatever we were doing (including, perhaps, giving our child a few minutes of undivided attention) as soon as one of those bells goes off. How can we ask our children to be more engaged with the 3 -D world or to watch the clouds go by if we aren’t? In The Joy Diet , Martha Beck talks about stopping our out- ward momentum for at least fifteen minutes a day. “[The problem is that] perpetually doing, without ever tuning in to the center of our being, is the equivalent of fueling a mighty ship by tossing all its navigational equipment into the furnace.” She goes on to say, “The voice of your true self is so small and still that virtually any distraction can drown it out, especially if you’re just beginning to hear it. You simply cannot develop the skill of listening with- out carving out and vigorously defending chunks of time during"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Modeling Self-Love and Awareness  which to do nothing.” (For an exercise on Doing Nothing, please see chapter 11 .) Enjoying our own company, disengaged from external stim- uli, is essential to our happiness. If we fail to help our children learn how to be alone, they will always be lonely. It is only when we are truly comfortable in our own skin that we can attract and sustain healthy relationships. Many people pair up with a romantic partner who they know in their heart of hearts isn’t a good fit, simply because they are so uncomfortable being with themselves. But just having another person around doesn’t quell loneliness; many of my married clients often express great despair over their sense of isolation, even when they have a wife or husband next to them in bed each night. Chasing after someone to fill the empty places in our hearts only creates differ- ent problems; it does not solve them. If you want your children to be happy without needing some- thing or someone to drown out the noise of their discontent, unplug the electronics at your house and do nothing now and again. See what happens as you become reacquainted with your- selves, each other, and the simple, satisfying ways that human beings enjoyed life long before landing in the digital world. Appreciating Our Body, Imperfections and All I talk to my body a lot. Sometimes out loud. I don’t usually share this fact with people (which makes it kind of interesting that I’m putting it into a book that I hope will be widely read). But the fact is, I place a lot of stock in having loving conversations with my body and its many miraculous parts and have decided that it is an idea worth sharing. “Thank you stomach, for digesting that meal so nicely.” If we fail to help our children learn how to be alone, they will always be lonely."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence “Thanks, eyes — what a great job you did in letting me see the colors of those flowers today!” “Thank you, heart, for beating so reliably and keeping my circulation going. You’re amazing!” “Thank you, legs, for ferrying me around so nicely. . . thank you, ears, thank you, liver . . . bones . . . knees . . . teeth . . .” This love fest with my body can go on for quite a while. I nearly always find that my heart is soft and melty by the end. Almost all of us take our body for granted until it breaks down, and then we can be quite mean to it, complaining about its failure to do what we want. And then there are the features we loathe; lips we wish were fuller, the nose we wish were dain- tier. If you consider how relentlessly critical we are of our human container and how it still plods on thanklessly, it really is a won- der that our physical systems work at all. If we treated employ- ees with the sort of disdain we so frequently show our body, they would walk off the job. And yet our bodies carry on doing their duties as best they can. Years ago I took a workshop during which we were given a paper bag with two holes cut out for the eyes. We were instructed to take it up to our hotel room, remove all our clothes, and stand in front of a mirror with the bag over our head. The assignment was to look through the holes at every inch of our bodies, noting the commentary in our head as we viewed ourselves. It sounded very weird. But it was a life-changing experience. I began by focusing on all the things I didn’t like — the parts that were too big or too small, too soft or too wrinkled. As I eased into the exercise, however, I fell into a place that was almost holy. I moved from noticing how harshly I judged each part of my body to realizing what a gift it had been to receive it and how perfect it was, exactly as it was."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Modeling Self-Love and Awareness  I saw the pooch in my belly as evidence of the blessing of motherhood. I recalled how my slightly wobbly knees had rallied through achiness to get me to the tops of mountains. I reflected on how my arms had cradled my loved ones. By the time I got to my feet I was overcome with thankfulness . . . and remorse. Those feet! They had tirelessly ferried me through life for decades, almost never receiving a word of thanks. I felt waves of appreci- ation for the vessel I had been given, a gift extraordinaire — and one I had endlessly criticized for not being somehow different, or better. We reassembled after the exercise to write letters to our bodies, then listened as people shared expressions of contrition, gratitude, and shame toward the miraculous heart-and-soul containers each of us had been allowed to inhabit. The room was pin-drop silent. Between racking sobs, a man in a wheelchair described the horri- ble things he had said to his body for years, angry at all the ways he had believed it had failed him. An over- weight woman spoke of the unhealthy habits she had inflicted on her body to keep love and lovers at bay. The room filled with a quiet hum of gratitude. It was just a weekend work- shop exercise, but it awakened something in me that thankfully remained. Thank your parts for serving you and allowing you to dance and sing and eat and see and smell and touch and climb. When your children see you acknowledging the wonderfulness of your body instead of complaining about what you don’t like about it, When your children see you acknowledging the wonderfulness of your body instead of complaining about what you don’t like about it, they will be far more likely to regard their own bodies — warts and all — with respect, care, and appreciation."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence they will be far more likely to regard their own bodies — warts and all — with respect, care, and appreciation. Enlisting Your Tribe From time to time a weary mother plops down on the couch in my office looking like something the cat dragged in. I soon discover that she has been running on fumes. She sleeps five hours a night if she ’s lucky, and her slumber is usually interrupted by a child visitor climbing into her bed and thrashing about, making peace- ful sleep something she can only dream about. For sustenance, she nibbles the remains of her children’s unfinished meals as she hustles around the kitchen, never sitting down for a proper meal. She laughs when I ask about the last time she read a book and can’t remember what it feels like to engage in a meaningful adult conversation with anyone other than her partner, with whom she discusses . . . the kids. I have been known to send this type of client away after a few minutes in my office, asking her to follow some instructions for at least one week, after which she is free to come back for a session. “I would like you to drink water the minute you notice you feel thirsty, eat something nutritious within a few minutes of realizing you are hungry (while sitting down), pee as soon as you feel the urge (many have gotten used to holding it until it ’s unbearable), and rest with your feet up and your eyes closed — even for three minutes — when you feel tired.” My client usually thinks I’m joking and laughs a little ner- vously. She quickly finds out that I’m serious. I tell her, “Until you begin taking care of yourself, whatever work we do together with regard to your children or family is irrelevant.” Now, mind you, I don’t do this very often; while most of the parents I work with fall short in some way when it comes to self- care, what I have described is extreme. But when I have parents"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Modeling Self-Love and Awareness  — yes, they are usually women — who have thoroughly aban- doned any sense of loving care toward their body and spirit, I send them home. (In fact, at times I tell them to just go and have a rest in their car since someone is looking after their kids for at least as long as they were meant to be in session with me!) I want them to understand that unless they shift their attitude and behav- ior toward meeting their own most basic needs, they will not be up to the task of being the Captain of the ship with their children. It is simply impossible to parent in ones or twos and not feel frayed at the edges, if not outright exhausted. We are not sup- posed to raise kids on our own; we are meant to do it as part of a tribe. In her beautiful essay “I Miss the Village,” Bunmi Laditan writes, When one of us was feeling sick or needed extra rest from a long night up with a child, we ’d swoop in and tend to your children as we would our own for as long as nec- essary — no need to even ask. You would drift off to a healing sleep with full confidence. We ’d want you to be well because we ’d know that we ’re only as strong as our weakest member — and not only that, we ’d love you, not with the sappy love of greeting cards, but with an appre- ciative love that has full knowledge of how your colors add to our patchwork. . . . I miss that village of mothers that I’ve never had. The one we traded for homes that, despite being a stone ’s throw, feel miles apart from each other. The one we traded for locked front doors, blinking devices and afternoons alone on the floor playing one- on-one with our little ones. Parents — build yourselves a tribe.

It is virtually impossible for one or two parents to raise a child alone. We require propping up, and time to our- selves. And when we have challenging children, it is vital that we receive extra guidance, support, and simply — a break. A woman I know who has cancer said, “If you’re there for my kids, you’re there for me.” Please, expand your network. In addition to the support and camaraderie that our tribe can provide us as parents, it is also important that our children develop healthy attachments with other trustworthy adults. In one of the tribes we visited in Tanzania, little ones wanting comfort or a cuddle simply grabbed onto the leg of the nearest mother. The laughter among the women was easy and relaxed. Kids wandered, big and small mixing together. In New Zealand I spent time at a tiny country school, where the children played barefooted soc- cer — five-year-olds and thirteen-year-olds happily tumbling around together. “They have to get along,” the headmaster told me. “They’re all they’ve each got.” Children who feel they are part of a community grow up feeling anchored. I urge you to look around for a group of like- minded, like-hearted parents with kids reasonably close in age to your own. Plan ways to spend more time together, as friends and partners in raising children, offering one another support, respite, and time to recharge. Appreciating Ourselves We cannot talk about self-care without looking at the ways we talk to ourselves in the privacy of our own thoughts. As a therapist, I am privy to an unfiltered glimpse at people ’s self-talk, and let me tell you, it isn’t pretty. “You can’t do anything right!” “You’re so It is virtually impossible for one or two parents to raise a child alone. We require propping up, and time to ourselves."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Modeling Self-Love and Awareness  fat!” “Why would anyone love you?” I often ask my clients how they would react if a friend spoke to them the way they sometimes speak to themselves. “How long would you let that person remain in your life if they said things to you like you say to yourself ?” Usually, the answer is instantaneous. “If another person spoke to me like that, I’d want nothing to do with them!” And yet we are ruthlessly unkind to ourselves. I frequently do online classes, and in the first session I often set the stage for the work we ’re going to be doing together, reminding parents on the call that as they learn new approaches, they may be tempted to be self-critical if they fail to implement a new idea, or resort to yelling or threatening. I tell my students, “There ’s nothing wrong with feeling uncomfortable when we say or do things that don’t reflect the parent we aspire to be. If you put your hand on a hot stove, you want it to hurt. So there ’s value in a momentary, ‘Oof ! I didn’t like doing that.’ Where we get into trouble is when we then beat ourselves up, perhaps replicating the shaming voice of a parent or a teacher in our head. That is in fact quite harmful because when we feel shame, we become defen- sive and often lash out even more at our kids, repeating a vicious cycle.” I received this email in the midst of a three-part online class I taught for Glennon Melton’s Momastery tribe. The day after watching part two of the webinar, my husband and I received a letter in the mail from the city saying the weeds in our front yard were too tall and we needed to cut them. We bought the house in this shape a few years back with the hopes of fixing the front yard, but I was seven months pregnant and we had a two-year- old when we moved in. However, it has always bothered me. We live in a neighborhood of perfect front yards"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence and throughout my life my dad has always emphasized appearances, especially in homes. I have always had his voice in my head telling me how horrible my yard looked, and sometimes I even had his real voice telling me how horrible my yard looked. Well, after opening the letter I went into full panic mode. I ended up on the floor in my kitchen with my head between my knees because I was on the verge of tears and a total panic attack. And then I took everything we have been learning through this webinar and I applied it to myself. I started saying out loud the stories I was saying in my head: “My neighbors must hate me,” “I knew they were shunning us — they must have complained,” “They must think I’m so lazy. . . . Well, I am so lazy — just look at my front yard” “If my dad found out he would say, ‘I told you so.’ ” After hearing the stories I was telling myself, I decided to tell the truth out loud, “I’m a really busy mom of two young kids.” “My husband and I both work full- time.” “My kids are a higher priority right now, and I don’t have enough time for them as it is.” And then I gave myself a pat on the back and burst into tears. All this is to say thank you ! I truly don’t believe I understood the power of those voices in my head. I was destroying myself as a person and as a mother. For as long as I can remember, I have lacked self-love and self- confidence because the voice in my head was so clear and so negative. And now that I have the tools to change that, I am so excited! As I lay in my four-year-old daughter’s bed last night, she showered me with kisses as I told her all the reasons"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Modeling Self-Love and Awareness  I loved her (not accomplishment based). I realized how much her bedtime has changed. Thank you both for teach- ing me to embrace my “messy, beautiful life.” I read this woman’s email and sat quietly for a long time, touched and inspired. Her story was my story, and your story, and the story of everyone who is walking a path of healing. I am simply awed by the beauty of the human spirit. Not long ago I interviewed Thupten Jinpa, the primary trans- lator for the Dalai Lama. I asked Jinpa if His Holiness ever spoke about parenting. His reply astonished me. “His Holiness, he ’s one of the most compassionate people I’ve ever met. He said, ‘When I look at the parenting experience I sometimes wonder — if I were a parent, would I have that kind of patience?’ ” My! If the Dalai Lama isn’t sure he would have enough patience to parent, surely we can all relax a little bit about our shortcomings! It is only when we accept ourselves with compas- sion, warts and all, that we can further our growth through the stumbles and tumbles of raising children. I think one of the greatest shifts I have made, both as a mother and as someone doing her best to keep grow- ing, was to make peace with my imper- fections. Until we accept, appreciate, and love all of ourselves, as is — body, mind, and spirit — we simply cannot ask others to treat us well. If we want our children to move into adulthood with confidence and a sense of self-love, we must show them what that looks like.

Maintaining Healthy Boundaries in Relationships This morning I turned on the tap to run some hot water into the bathroom sink. After what I thought was plenty of time for it to get nice and hot, I felt the temperature. Lukewarm. I let it run a little longer and checked again. Still not hot. Ran it even longer. What was the problem? I finally figured out that I had uninten- tionally turned on both faucets — the cold along with the hot. As long as there was cold in the mix, that water was never going to get hot. It made me think of my relationships and how difficult it has been to accept the what is about people in my life so that I could adjust my expectations accordingly. Just as that water was never going to get hot because there was cold in the mix, some people are never going to be able to show up in the ways we wish, for reasons we may never understand. Something else is in the mix; the cold is on. When we love someone who is not good for us, it can be diffi- cult to accept that we may not be able to continue the relationship. Perhaps she is dishonest. Or he may be abusive. In some cases, we can feel tremendous love for someone who is quite toxic for us, either intentionally or because of his own woundedness. Many times I have watched children chase after friends who throw them a crumb now and then but who generally treat them terribly. In her book Odd Girl Out , Rachel Simmons talks about the lifelong impact of girlhood cruelty on women in their forties and beyond. In my own life, I have anguished over people I have loved who I finally had to accept could not remain in my life. But if we are to help our children sustain loving and nurturing relationships in their adult years, it is vital that we teach them that"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Modeling Self-Love and Awareness  loving someone should not hurt and that they can survive letting go of a person who is harmful to their spirits. We also need to help our children understand that they cannot save anyone. While I believe we have a responsibility to try to alleviate the suffering of those who are in pain when we can , chil- dren who try to rescue troubled friends usually meet with disas- trous results. Our kids are not meant to be saviors and should not be expected to take care of their friends, parents, or siblings, even though rescuing someone can feel oh so rewarding. If we instill in them the belief that it is their job to heal the people around them — whatever the personal cost — we send them down the painful road of people-pleasing from which it can take years to recover. There is a quote that eloquently captures this idea: If you see a drowning man, reach out and try to pull him from the water. If he grabs your arm and tries to pull you in, push him as hard as you can. Help your children develop healthy boundaries — ones that reflect their self-respect and worth. If they have friends who are hurtful, explore with them whether the overall benefit of that rela- tionship outweighs the costs. If they come to see that they deserve better, help them grieve the loss of that friendship — for it is a great loss to end a relationship that has had some value to us — so that they can effectively move on. Listening to Intuition In his book Protecting the Gift , security specialist Gavin de Becker shares numerous examples of crime victims ignoring their intu- ition despite sensing that they were in danger. De Becker believes it is essential that we listen to the intuitive messages that come in the form of hesitation, doubt, persistent thoughts, and nag- ging feelings. He explains that intuition’s ultimate message is the one most difficult to ignore: fear. “But people try to silence even that one: Calm down, calm down, it’s probably nothing , some tell"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence themselves, rather than giving a fair hearing to nature ’s lifesaving signal.” He goes on to say that “In fact, the root of the word intu- ition, tueri , means to guard and to protect.” If we are to raise confident children, we need to encourage them to listen to their inner wisdom and to trust their intuitive hunches. Our bodies are finely tuned instruments that can help us unravel the source of an upset, warn us when something isn’t quite right, or alert us to potential danger. Sweaty palms, butter- flies in the stomach, tension in the back of our neck, or a rapid heartbeat can all be indications that something is amiss. We may feel uncomfortable with someone ’s energy or sense that despite outward appearances, something isn’t safe, even if everything looks “right.” And of course the opposite is true: someone may appear disheveled or a situation may be different from what we expected but be perfectly fine. Intuition helps us discern whether all is well or whether we are at risk. Share with your children the fact that our subconscious minds gather and sift through tremendous amounts of information to help us make decisions and that while we shouldn’t ignore facts and figures, there is much to be gained from learning how to read intuitive signals and trusting our instincts. If your daughter is upset about something going on with a friend, you might suggest, “Get quiet for a minute, honey, and see if you can tune in to your intuition. What do you feel is the best way to handle that problem with Elizabeth and Toni? Does it feel like a healthy relationship? Do you leave your time with them feeling good?” You can help this process along by offering a few of your thoughts, while inviting her to get still and tune in to how her body responds as you present each idea. Our bodies tell us when we should be trusting, open, or guarded. Kids whose boundaries are respected have a much easier time setting them appropriately with their peers. Teach them that"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Modeling Self-Love and Awareness  no is a complete sentence. Role-play scenarios in which they practice honor- ing their gut feeling when they are in an iffy situation, such as someone suggest- ing they try a beer when they don’t feel ready or asking them to get sexually involved when they don’t want to. Impact Training is a fantastic program for teenage girls and women that helps them step out from the restraints of their social- ization to be nice and helpful, encouraging them to declare their no in powerful ways. They also have programs for schoolchildren of both genders. I highly recommend it. One of the ways I teach children to tune in to the subtler mes- sages of their emotions is by asking them to describe their feel- ings in terms of colors. “If red is angry, black is sad, orange is happy, and so on, What color are you feeling ?” In her book Sit- ting Still Like a Frog, Eline Snel asks children to tune in to their emotional state by inviting them to share their Personal Weather Report. “What is the weather like right now in your body? Is it sunny or stormy?” (For more on this technique, see chapter 11 .) Children should understand that it is normal to experience many different feelings, including anger. Keep a light plas- tic bat or punching bag on hand so your kids know that when they feel anger in their bodies, they can express it in safe and acceptable ways. It ’s good for our kids to stay present to the emo- tions in their bodies rather than shutting down, as so many of us did because our own parents told us not to be scared or hurt or mad. We are each born with an inner toolbox of resources that we can draw on throughout our lives. Helping children learn to trust the internal compass of their intuition will help them steer away from trouble and toward beneficial opportunities. Kids whose boundaries are respected have a much easier time setting them appropriately with their peers. Teach them that no is a complete sentence."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence Living with Passion When I was sixteen, I worked after school at a day-care center. One day, four-year-old Ruby arrived. Her family had recently moved to Kansas City from India, and she knew not a word of English. I thought it might be helpful if I learned a few Hindi words from her parents so I could ask little Ruby if she was hungry or needed to use the bathroom. From the moment my Hindi lesson began, something inside me started jumping up and down with joy. I loved this language. I practically inhaled our lessons, not wanting our time together to stop. As a sixteen-year-old living in Kansas in the 1970 s, I didn’t have a lot of options for learning this “exotic” language beyond imposing on the generosity of Ruby’s parents who tutored me when they could find the time. I was so keen to learn that I began calling around the country, discovering that the University of Pennsylvania had a Hindi department. I ordered their textbook and waited eagerly until it arrived. As soon as I received the book, I became a devoted student of Hindi. In the absence of having an actual teacher, I assigned myself exercises as homework, checking my answers at the back of the book. I devoured the material, and when I moved to New York at seventeen, I searched used bookstores for dictionaries and writing primers. When I ran out of those I could practice my Hindi with, I started calling people out of the phone book whose last name was Singh, asking them — in Hindi — if they would chat with me! The best way I can describe this near obsession with learning Hindi was that I loved the way the words tasted in my mouth. An enormous happiness filled me whenever I studied, making it impossible to subdue the urge to learn. This makes no sense — a teenage girl from Kansas passion- ately wanting to learn the language of people on the other side of"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Modeling Self-Love and Awareness  the world. Yet learning Hindi opened doors for me that to this day continue to add something very special to my life. And of course when I have traveled in India, the experiences I’ve had because I speak the language (albeit imperfectly) have been extraordinary. Consider how your children watch you using your time. If you carve out space for pursuing your passions — reading, paint- ing, watching the stars, gardening — your children will see learn- ing as an important part of life. And if you aren’t sure what brings you joy, pursue the little things that catch your eye: a link on a Twitter feed, an interview on the radio, a headline on a magazine cover. Follow the bread crumbs, and they will carry you to where your heart wants you to go. Fostering Curiosity Each child comes with his or her unique built-in, preloaded pas- sions. Some kids are consumed by a desire to dance their hearts out. Others want nothing more than to concoct culinary delights. Some want to tell stories, spend time with animals, or sketch inventions. If we want our children to discover their passion and purpose, we must stay open to what they drift toward rather than pushing them in directions we prefer they follow but that do not call to them. Doing this requires plenty of unstructured time and exposure to a variety of people and experiences. The endless organized activities we impose on our kids, coupled with pounds of nightly homework and the constant pull of their digital lives, often leaves no time for the quiet in which they might hear the voice lead- ing them to their path of exploration. Had I not had free time in high school, I might never have pursued my desire to learn Hindi.

I love the line from the contract that Janell Burley Hofmann wrote when she gave her thirteen-year-old son an iPhone: “Wonder without googling.” In today’s world, children rarely puzzle over things; the answer to any question is just seconds away, via whatever device is handy. But one of the greatest skills we can help our children develop is the capacity to solve problems. This requires settling into the not-knowing space generated between curiosity and answers. Give your kids the opportunity to step outside traditional classroom walls and sniff out the things that interest them. These pursuits may not make sense at the time or even be long-lasting, but what a joy it is to follow the yearn- ings of the heart, as mysterious as they may be. When we do, all kinds of magic can happen.

What ’s most important is that they know it ’s safe to tell you their truth. Your situation doesn’t have a simple fix, short of finding a new job. In the meantime, if you acknowledge the frustrations your job sometimes creates rather than making a guilt-inducing remark if they complain — “You don’t want Mommy to lose her job, do you?” — you will lessen the impact of being tied to your devices.

Some find it helpful to ask their children’s teachers to introduce them to the parents of classmates their child seems to like. Others take part in school happenings or attend local library events for kids. Forging a tribe takes some effort, but the payoff is enormous, both for you and your children. We are not meant to go it alone or to parent in isolation. Take it slowly, perhaps setting an intention of meeting one new person a month. Over time, one person will introduce you to another, and before long you will have created your own network of support. Can I prune out my ex-husband? question: I agree that it is important to weed out the people in our lives who are hurtful to us, but what about my ex-husband? He is rude, unpredictable, and inconsiderate. I wish I could prune him from my life, but because of our custody arrangement, I have no choice but to deal with him almost every day. suggestion: As I’ve mentioned, we sometimes find ourselves with children whose behavior pushes our buttons, prompting us either to react out of old patterns or to rise to the challenge of working through unfinished business that ultimately helps us grow into a better version of ourselves. Certain adults also seem to have been custom designed to trigger us, often in circumstances like yours in which we cannot simply write them off. Co-parenting after divorce is one of the hardest things a par- ent will ever have to do. On the one hand, you have parted ways with someone you once loved who has hurt or disappointed you so deeply that you can no longer tolerate living with them. You may feel rage, resentment, confusion, and profound sorrow. Nat- urally it would be less painful to wipe this person from your daily life. But this is where we get to practice all those declarations such"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Modeling Self-Love and Awareness  as, “I’d take a bullet for my son” or “I’d move heaven and earth to keep my little girls safe.” You have a choice, every time you interact with your former husband. Will you focus on his unpleasant qualities, causing your stomach to tighten as you hiss out essential updates about your children? Or will you take out the magnifying glass to notice the good? I understand that focusing on his negative attributes may make it easier to come to terms with your divorce. But your children have endured a major loss, even if it was for the best. They need to be spared as much tension and strife between their mommy and daddy as possible. Limit your contact as needed, but take the higher road. Don’t take his behavior personally. Reach for compassion if you can, recognizing that on a deeper level — underneath his personality flaws or the hurts of your shared past — he is simply a fellow journeyer stumbling along on the path of life. By grieving for what you hoped you might have together or for the man you wish he was, you will be better able to accept your former husband as is, annoying faults and all. My friend and colleague Katherine Woodward Thomas, cre- ator of Conscious Uncoupling, reminds us that “we may be able to undo a marriage, but we can never undo a family without leav- ing the people in that family emotionally homeless.” She admon- ishes us to put the needs of our child first by honoring how deeply he needs our permission and support to love and believe in his other parent, no matter how flawed that person might be. Learn- ing to hold the complexity of your child ’s vulnerability with your own disappointment, and choosing to protect the emotional home your child has with your former spouse (in spite of your hurt), is the very essence of what it is to be a compassionate parent."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" Children have never been very good at listening to their elders, but they have never failed to imitate them. — James A. Baldwin Healthy Communication Strengthens Connection • • CHAPTER 6 S ome years ago I was on a safari in Tanzania. We had been driving for a day or two in search of a rhino, with no success. Our guide pulled the jeep into a rest area, where we would take a break and have lunch. Excited about the possibility of asking other Serengeti safari travelers if they had had any luck spotting this elusive animal, I said to the driver of the next jeep, “Have you seen any rhinos?” He mumbled something, clearly unhappy with my question, and went on his way. I asked our guide what the man had said and have never forgotten his answer. “He said that you did not greet him fi rst.” I took the hit. He was absolutely right; I had rudely insinuated myself into this man’s presence without so much as a Hello, how are you? I learned something priceless and am grateful that this man had the dignity and self-respect not to indulge my uncon- sciousness. I had forgotten my manners. Modeling good manners is an essential ingredient in raising a child who becomes a confi dent, successful adult. I’m not talking about formal and complex rituals but simply the behaviors that"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence make people feel comfortable. Some of us get hung up on the notion that teaching manners to kids is old-fashioned or only rel- evant to those living among royalty — rather unlikely for most of us. But I think the ability to put people at ease is as vital as having a diploma from a prestigious college. We may not know that our coworker graduated from Yale or Oxford, but we can immedi- ately tell whether we feel relaxed and comfortable in her presence. Modeling Good Manners “Me first!” “I want more!” “Those are mine!” are all the normal expressions of a child who hasn’t yet developed empathy or diplo- macy. Children are naturally egocentric; if there ’s only one piece of pie left, they’ll grab it. If your daughter is having fun on the swing set, she ’s going to resent giving it up to another child wait- ing for a turn. That doesn’t mean she ’s selfish; it just means she ’s behaving like a child. A parent ’s uncritical guidance helps young ones learn the basics of showing concern about the wishes and needs of others. There is no better way to teach good manners than to demon- strate them day in and day out in the presence of your children. For instance, at mealtimes ensure that no one begins eating until everyone has been seated and served. If your kids forget, let them know that you understand that they’re hungry, while modeling patience as others dish up their food before you pick up your fork. Help your children learn to share and take turns when they have a friend come over to play. Explain that you know it is hard to wait for a turn on the piano or to leave the bigger piece of cake for someone else, but that in your home, guests are treated with special care. There is no better way to teach good manners than to demonstrate them day in and day out in the presence of your children."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Healthy Communication Strengthens Connection  Teach your children how to introduce people. “Ms. Norris, I would like you to meet my cousin Joey” or “Grandpa, this is my friend Elsa.” Make friendly greeting rituals part of the way you welcome guests into your home. Show your children how to make eye contact while offering a handshake to an arriving guest — or a hug, if appropriate and comfortable for your child. Part of having good manners is acknowledging another per- son’s feelings. When you show your children what it looks like to be accountable for an oversight or an inconsiderate remark, they will follow your lead. If you offend someone, let your kids hear you apologize, without justifying your behavior. Finally, make sure your youngsters know how to re- ceive a compliment. “Thank you for that” is a simple, gracious way to take in someone ’s kind words and is much healthier than deflecting them. And don’t save good manners for when company is around or those times when you’re out in public. Children smell hypoc- risy a mile away. Use those magic words — please and thank you — authentically when you speak with your loved ones. Peggy O’Mara, founder of Mothering magazine said, “Be careful how you speak to your children. One day, it will become their inner voice.” Children develop civility, thoughtfulness, and a considerate nature when they grow up in the midst of caring and respectful behavior. Acknowledge when your children exhibit good man- ners, and gently correct them when they forget. Don’t expect them to behave perfectly, and make sure to factor in their devel- opmental stage as you set expectations for their behavior. And if you have a child with a developmental challenge or psychological issue, don’t succumb to the guilt and shame that When you show your children what it looks like to be accountable for an oversight or an inconsiderate remark, they will follow your lead."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence often show up when you imagine that others are judging you for your children’s awkwardness or shortcomings. Get the loving support you need so that you know that your best is more than good enough, regardless of how your children behave. Avoid creating power struggles about manners, especially with your teens. Trying to force a child to apologize or be polite will only backfire. With patience and loving guidance, your chil- dren will become the kind of people who make others comfort- able. Ultimately, that ’s what good manners are all about. Dealing with Anger Parents often bring their children to me because of their problems with anger. Sometimes the child has a difficult time managing his outbursts because his capacity to manage big feelings is underde- veloped because of immaturity or impulsive tendencies. But often I discover that Mom or Dad also have big tempers. All of us — children and adults alike — are subject to strong emotions that we cannot always control. Some people are easy- going, hardly ruffled when life doesn’t go their way. But others struggle to keep frustration and disappointment from wreaking emotional havoc. If the root cause of anger is not addressed, we sometimes end up doing or saying things we regret. Using threats or punishments to deter our children from acting out angrily can drive unresolved emotions underground, where they can show up as eating disorders, addiction, or depression. It can also stockpile the fuel for a bigger explosion of rage later on. Instead of shaming ourselves when we lose our cool, we need to step back, determine what we ’re thinking or feeling, and iden- tify the underlying source of our rage. Anger can be the outward manifestation of unresolved grief, sadness, frustration, stress, hor- monal imbalance, anxiety, or fatigue. Until we understand that it is a symptom of something that needs to be addressed rather than"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Healthy Communication Strengthens Connection  a voluntary behavior, we will not be able to diminish its impact on our lives. When I am working with a family in which angry outbursts are common- place, I find it helpful to facilitate con- versations between the yeller and the yellee (the target of the rage) in a way that makes it safe for both to be heard. When both parties can lay down their defenses and step into the other’s shoes for a few moments, they become more willing to work on resolving whatever emotions are fueling their flare-ups. I also tell the following story (author unknown): A young boy had a very bad temper; he often lashed out in anger at those around him. One day his father gave him a bag of nails and told him that each time he lost his temper, he was to go hammer a nail into the fence. The first few days, the boy had to hammer lots of nails into the fence. But as time went on, he gradually found that he could catch himself before he lost his tem- per. Knowing that he would have to find a nail and take it to the backyard to hammer it into the fence helped him manage his angry outbursts. Finally, the boy came to a point where he was able to tell his father that he had learned how to stop himself from losing his temper. His father said that each time he was able to get through a day without hurting others with his anger, he could remove a nail from the fence. The day arrived when the boy went to his father to tell him that all the nails were now gone. The father led his son to the fence and said, “You have learned something very important, son. But I want Until we understand that anger is a symptom of something that needs to be addressed rather than a voluntary behavior, we will not be able to diminish its impact on our lives."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence you to look at the holes in the wood. This fence will never be the same as it was before the nails were hammered into it. In the same way, when you say things in anger — even if you apologize — your words and actions leave a scar like these holes in the fence .” We need to help our children learn to lengthen the gap between having an impulse to say or do something and acting on that impulse. To err is human and to forgive, divine. But as chil- dren deepen their understanding that, like nails in the fence, our actions have irreversible consequences and can harm important relationships, we can help them take steps toward slowing down when they are upset, taking responsibility for their actions, and making amends when needed. The damage done by cruel words and hurtful behaviors can- not be undone. Whenever we argue with others, we need to pause and consider the effects our words might have on them. Telling the Truth There are some great scenes in the show The Newsroom in which Jim, a genteel young man, has been dating Lisa, with whom he was fixed up by Maggie, despite his protestations. Because Jim is so well-mannered, he continues dating Lisa despite feeling that he has little in common with her. He is in fact much more interested in Maggie. (It ’s complicated.) Jim and Lisa’s relationship contin- ues for months. Maggie even buys gifts and a romantic card for Jim to give to Lisa for Valentine ’s Day, solidifying Lisa’s attach- ment to Jim. Lisa finally tells Jim that she loves him, and because he is so polite, he says he loves her, too. The relationship becomes even more serious, while Jim suffers in silence. He knows that he should tell Lisa the truth but can’t bear to hurt her feelings. Finally, Lisa happens to overhear the truth about how Jim"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Healthy Communication Strengthens Connection  feels about her, and about his affection for Maggie, and she con- fronts him. Even as he is being given the opportunity to fess up, Jim denies what she has heard. Wisely, Lisa says, “Jim, admit it. We could be choosing preschools for our children before you worked up the courage to tell me how you really feel!” She convinces him that she would rather know the truth than be in make-believe love, and he finally lets go. It is not easy to navigate difficult conversations, especially about sensitive issues, but if we want our child to have healthy grown-up relationships, then teaching her the art of speaking her truth is crucial. It is helpful if our children routinely hear us clearing up problems with our loved ones with opening lines like, “Something has been bothering me . . .” “I’m not sure what you meant when you said . . .” “I’ve been having a hard time with . . .” “I don’t really like it when . . .” Most of us have read enough self-help books to know that one of the keys to maintaining a great relationship is good com- munication. But what does that look like? As mentioned, my Act I Parenting strategy helps parents come alongside rather than at their children so they will be receptive to their guidance instead of clenching and resisting. This approach involves validating the child ’s experience rather than trying to talk her out of her feel- ings. The same holds true for anyone we are communicating with; when we are forceful in conveying our point of view, we engender resistance in the other person. Good communication requires that we acknowledge the other person’s position, recognizing that he has as much right to his feelings as we have to ours, instead of trivializing his opin- ion or arguing him out of his feelings when they differ from our own. It means taking responsibility for how we communicate, ex- pressing our concerns in a way that doesn’t cast blame or make the other person wrong."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence Good communication creates space for hurts or grievances to be aired and truths to be told. It fosters intimacy, even if getting there is uncomfortable, as difficult feelings are brought out into the open. It provides an avenue for needs to be met or at least negotiated. It helps us get to know others — and ourselves. And it allows us to receive important feedback from those who are important to us — if we can step out of our ego to receive it. These are all qualities we want our children to possess as they grow. Listening Respectfully We can coach our children to express their wishes without aggres- sion and to listen respectfully to others. But as I have said again and again, we have to show them what that looks like for it to stick. Telling your child not to interrupt or roll her eyes will mean nothing if you and your partner interrupt and roll your eyes at each other when you don’t see eye to eye. I once read that before you speak, you should ask yourself three things: 1 . Is it true? 2 . Is it necessary? 3 . Is it kind? By infusing your communications with care and conscious- ness, you cannot help but raise children who are more aware of the impact of their words and for whom an internal bell rings when they or someone else speaks in a hurtful way. In my clinical practice, I often facilitate listening practices between a parent and child, choosing a topic that regularly gen- erates conflict. The rules of the game are simple: One person Good communication creates space for hurts or grievances to be aired and truths to be told.

The listener faces the speaker with open body language and is not allowed to interrupt, grimace, disagree, or in any way disparage what the speaker is expressing. When the speaker is finished talking, the listener has to ask questions or make comments that generate three yeses. This exer- cise almost never fails to bring parent and child closer, because each has been given the chance to safely express themselves and feel heard. It is very easy to do and not only helps family members feel more connected but also paves the way for children to develop the skill of nego- tiating conversations that allow both parties to feel understood. In chapter 11 you’ll find an example of this type of dialogue. Connecting through Chitchat I want to touch on another topic related to communication, one that may surprise you: small talk. For much of my life, I thought that chitchat was a rather frivolous and unenlightened activity. Sharing opinions about the weather or the tastiest brand of yogurt felt silly. But as I have gotten older, I have come to see things differently. We are a social species. When human beings come together, we have an instinct to connect. But how? We can certainly meet someone and gaze wordlessly into their eyes. But brief conversa- tions are lovely ways to exchange energy. The topic itself is irrel- evant. A discussion about the weather simply serves as a vehicle for making contact, conveying, “I see you. I am here with you. I’m interested in you.” It is helpful to teach our children how to dialogue with others Telling your child not to interrupt or roll her eyes will mean nothing if you and your partner interrupt and roll your eyes at each other when you don’t see eye to eye."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence so they can participate in short exchanges with whomever they might meet. I can’t count the times I have seen kids freeze up when someone tries to engage them in conversation. “What do you like to do, Bobby?” “I don’t know.” “Do you enjoy sports?” “I guess.” So while I am not a proponent of routinely superficial con- versation, I do believe there is a time and a place for a friendly chat and that we do our children no favors when we shield them by saying, “Sorry, she doesn’t want to talk.” Yes, some of us are introverts who are uncomfortable with social contact, legitimately shy creatures who find it painful to even look at someone we don’t know, let alone strike up a conversation. I’m not suggesting that we force our kids to be who they aren’t, and I’m certainly not pro- posing that we encourage them to chat up random strangers. But if we are to equip our youngsters with the skills they will need to grow into conscious, confident adults, then we need to teach them the art of conversation, according to their particular capabilities."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Healthy Communication Strengthens Connection  now it ’ s your turn Think about a situation in which communication broke down with someone important to you, resulting in angry words, resent- ment, or perhaps even estrangement. How did you contribute to the conversation taking a turn for the worse? Did you come at the other person with your guns blazing? Whenever you start a sentence with, “Why did you . . .” you’re almost guaranteed to elicit defensiveness in the other per- son. Did you passively agree to whatever the other person said, secretly fuming but refusing to express how you really felt? Take a few minutes to reflect on how you might have ap- proached this difficult conversation differently. How could you have made it clear that you were open to the other person’s point of view?

My son has problems with impulsivity as well as a bad temper, but he is also a very sensitive child. He feels terrible after he has had a tantrum, announcing that he hates himself. How can we help him work on not having major meltdowns without shaming him? suggestion: This scenario is often played out with children who are both sensitive and impulsive. On the one hand, they may have a thin skin and be especially vulnerable to hurts and slights. On the other, they may have poor brakes on the car in terms of their impulse control, skidding into meltdowns before they can stop themselves. There is no simple solution to your dilemma. It is good for your son to feel some regret for his outbursts because remorse acts as an inhibiting influence on behavior. If he feels bad about lashing out at his sibling, for instance, he may be better able to restrain himself the next time he gets upset. The problem is that while this idea works in theory, children with impulsivity issues usually don’t have the emotional maturity to thoughtfully weigh out the pros and cons of lashing out before they find themselves doing it. Their fuse is short; they feel angry, and in a flash, they have exploded. When children feel shame for not being able to control them- selves in the midst of an emotional storm, they need to know that they are not their behavior .

Should introverted children be made to chitchat? question: You talk about encouraging children to strike up conversations with others, but my daughter is extremely shy. She can hardly look people in the eye when they come to our house, although once she gets to know them she is terrific. Shouldn’t we let introverted kids be who they are rather than forcing them to chat with people when it pains them so? suggestion: Yes, we should let introverted kids be who they are; we should let all kids be who they are. But no child wants to be crippled with anxiety when faced with interacting with others. This question is difficult to answer because some kids need a gentle nudge, while others genuinely cannot and should not be drawn out. Far be it from me to suggest that a child significantly on the autism spectrum, for instance, should be scolded for not chatting with the cashier at the market. Trust yourself. If your child is incapable of engaging in social intercourse, than by all means, let her be. But if she is simply inex- perienced in opening up a conversation or establishing rapport, perhaps you will consider helping her become more comfortable in this area.

Even when he tells me that he does feel bad after he has yelled, he thinks it is a sign of weakness to apol- ogize to them. suggestion: Being married to someone does not guarantee that we will see eye to eye on every aspect of child rearing. Even if we determined that we were mostly in sync with our partner before having children together, there are still countless opportunities to disagree. Chances are your husband is patterning his behavior on that of his father or of an important role model from his childhood. These early impressions are powerful. Don’t lecture, advise, berate, or criticize him for his unwillingness to apologize to your children. If you come across as his scolding, shaming parent, you will only flip on the switch of his resistance. If your husband sees you acting with integrity around your kids — meaning he observes you taking responsibility for your actions — and subsequently notices your children being respect- ful and cooperative with you, he may eventually conclude that apologizing is a sign of strength, not weakness. But you will have to let him find his own way. If you judge him, he will only more staunchly defend his actions."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" Th e greatest way to live with honor in this world is to be what we pretend to be. — Socrates Walking the Talk • • CHAPTER 7 I once read about a tribe in Africa whose members do some- thing quite extraordinary when somebody does something wrong.

For two days the whole tribe surrounds the wrongdoer, telling him everything good he has done in his life. They view the man’s transgression as a cry for help and come together to hold him up and remind him of who he is, until he remembers the core good- ness from which he temporarily became disconnected . Consider what might happen if we did that with kids who are troubled or hurting? Imagine compassionately reminding them of their goodness instead of berating them when they make a mistake?

When my son was ten, he asked me why I had been rude to a telemarketer who had called during dinner. “Would you have acted that way if he was sitting in front of you?” he asked. “No, honey. . . of course not.” When people say that your kids will hold you to high stan- dards, they aren’t kidding. They see us at our best and our worst; everything we do makes an impression. The way we speak to a telemarketer or follow through on a promise to help with a sci- ence project is all duly noted by our children. We may forget our manners, or find we don’t have time after all to help as promised with a science project. That ’s okay; we ’re human, and will inevi- tably fall short of who we most want to be now and again. But when we behave in a way that doesn’t line up with what we preach to our children, we need to take responsibility. “I meant to allow time to help you with that project, and I can see that I’m letting you down.” Or, in the case of my son and the telemarketer, “I could give you excuses about why I spoke to that fellow rudely, but you’re right. I don’t feel good about how I was with him.” Adhering to the notion that how we do anything is how we do everything can be a real burden. We have to be willing to for- give ourselves — often.

Whether sitting around a fire thousands of years ago, or standing in a suburban Christmas tree lot, we humans learn best from the stories of others. Exposing children to the wisdom and insight of people who lost and then found their way after facing their mis- takes can make a big impact on their lives. Motivating Children to Tell the Truth All children fiddle with the truth; at certain ages it is developmen- tally appropriate. In fact, distorting the truth is part of learning the difference between fantasy and reality, fact and fiction. And of course kids hide the truth to avoid getting in trouble. The dis- comfort of perpetuating a deception is usually more tolerable than suffering the consequences of admitting a difficult truth, even at the risk of getting caught later. Later is later, and now is now. Rather than using fear and shame to encourage children to own up to their mistakes, we serve our kids better when we emphasize (and of course model) how much better it feels to be honest, even when it is difficult to do so. A study done at the University of Toronto in 2010 explored the factors that motivate children to be truthful. Children aged three to seven were left alone in a room after being told not to peek at a mystery toy. The researchers soon after returned to the room and read aloud a story — Pinocchio, The Boy Who Cried Wolf, or George Washington and the Cherry Tree . They then asked the children if they had peeked at the hidden toy. The children who had just listened to a story with negative consequences for dishonesty were told, “I don’t want you to be like Pinocchio or the boy who cried wolf; tell me the truth!” The children who heard the story about George Washington admitting"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence that he had indeed chopped down the cherry tree were asked to be like him. These children were three times as likely to confess to having peeked as the ones who heard about a negative result of lying — the shame of Pinocchio’s nose growing or the boy who cried wolf being eaten. In an interesting twist, when the ending of the George Washington story was changed so that instead of confessing to his father that he had chopped down the cherry tree he lied and said he had not, the children who heard the revised version were as unwilling to confess to peeking at the mystery toy as those who had heard stories in which dishonesty led to a negative consequence. The results suggest that children are more likely to admit to a mistake when they think of honesty as a positive quality than if they think of dishonesty as something that leads to a bad result. In other words, fear of punishment is a weaker motivator than the promise of praise and approval. Apologizing In my parenting life, I realized that although I didn’t have to be perfect, I did have to learn how to take responsibility for those times when I lost my cool and said or did things that were beneath me. I had to learn how to apologize . This was a difficult process because my ego had generated many strategies to avoid being wrong. I had grown up in an environment that valued Being Right over acknowledging one ’s shortcomings and was trained in the art of defending yourself, a graduate from the school of Justifications, Rationalizations, and Blaming Others. Children are more likely to admit to a mistake when they think of honesty as a positive quality than if they think of dishonesty as something that leads to a bad result."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Walking the Talk  Remember when I said that our children can be our greatest teachers? It was my son who provided me with the opportunity to discover that I could relax into the blessed experience of being imperfect. I could own up to my mistakes. It was a slow process, but what a relief! And there was an enormous side benefit: I was now raising a young man who willingly apologized when he messed up, demonstrating that he valued love over winning an argument or being right. This is what I have learned about apologies. They must be genuine; I have no interest in forcing children to reluctantly mumble, “I’m sorry” after they have hurt somebody’s feelings or body. In fact, an insincere apology teaches children that it ’s okay to be a jerk (that ’s a clinical term!), as long as they mutter those two little words. It is essential that our children deliver an apology only after they have come to feel genuine remorse. This cannot happen in the context of shame. When we humil- iate our child for slipping up, her defense mechanisms kick in, making it harder for her to admit to any wrongdoing. Instead we must gently help our children be exposed to the injured heart of another so they can consider the impact of their unkind behavior. Only then can they deliver an authentic “I’m sorry,” or make some gesture of reparation. The first step in apologizing is to say, “I’m sorry” from your heart, without tagging on a justifi- cation for your behavior. “I’m sorry, but I only stepped on your foot because it was sticking out too far” is not an apology. Many people are good at delivering a superficial apology, but they neu- tralize the impact by explaining why they did what they did, often including the other person as a causal factor. “I’m sorry I got mad when you were late, but I was worried sick! And I’m so tired . . .

See the difference? There may be a time when you talk about what happened in a way that helps the other person see the ways he may have contributed to the problem. But the initial exchange is about taking the sting out of your behavior. Second, we need to specifically acknowledge how our behav- ior affected the other person. “It must have really hurt your foot when I stepped on it.” Or, “When I shouted at you the minute you walked in the door, you probably felt blindsided, especially when you had been sitting in traffic for an hour.” This lets the injured party know that we aren’t just intellectually spouting out words that sound good but that we have actually put ourselves in her shoes and can imagine the specific ways she might have been affected by our actions. Third, we reveal how we felt as a result of our mistake, sharing our intention to do better. “I felt wretched afterward — embarrassed that I lost my cool. I want you to know that I’m really working on this. I love you and don’t want you to worry that if you’re running late, I might launch into a yelling episode.” Here you may choose to share what you are doing to minimize the likelihood that this behavior will repeat itself — whether it ’s committing to leave the room when you become upset, counting to ten, journaling, working with a therapist, or getting more sleep. Finally, you ask the other party what he needs in order to forgive you and to feel better. “Is there anything you need from me?” This lets the other person tell you that she appreciates your apology and is ready to move on or gives her permission to express what she would like from you. For example, she might say, “I want to forgive you, but I’d like you to assure me that the next time I’m running late and my phone isn’t getting service, you will listen to what happened before unleashing your anger.”"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Walking the Talk  Someone once told me that at their child ’s preschool, little ones are specifically taught not to say, “I’m sorry” when they hurt another child. Instead, they are instructed to ask their friend if she is okay and to show their concern by bringing her a cup of water and a damp paper towel (for their boo-boo.) Anyone who witnessed the accident is also encouraged to bring a damp paper towel to the injured child. So whenever a child in that school is injured, he or she is provided with a cup of water and a pile of damp paper towels! I love the image of a little boy or girl wiping their tears while surrounded by a group of small children help- ing them feel better. These children are learning at a very young age how to take practical steps toward making amends when a mistake has been made rather than just mumbling a disingenuous, “Sorry. . .” To sum up, here are the four steps of delivering an apology: 1 . “I’m sorry,” spoken from the heart and without any ex- planations, which might be seen as an attempt to justify or defend what happened. 2 . “I imagine you felt _______,” showing that you have stepped into the other person’s shoes with empathy and concern. 3 . “In the future . . .” Here is where you announce your intention to do better, making it clear that your hurtful behavior is not something you want to repeat. 4 . “Is there anything you need from me?” You are inviting the other person to share whatever might be preventing him from forgiving you and moving on.

Think about a mistake you made that prompted an important life lesson. In your journal, describe the situation. Was anyone hurt? If so, how? Did you immediately address the fallout from this mistake, or did you initially deny having made it and hope that no one found out? If you did not address your mistake, what did it cost you to withhold the truth? What amends did you make to whomever was affected by this mistake?

Isn’t it confusing to them? Shouldn’t a child face negative consequences for misbehaving, instead of being told that he is a good person? suggestion: When we equate a child with his disobedient be- havior, we do him a great disservice. Human beings do things for one of two reasons: either to experience pleasure or to avoid pain. A person who lies, steals, or harms others does so either because he believes that his actions will somehow make him feel better — more powerful, respected, or vindicated — or because he thinks they will help him avoid some form of pain. Children who are consistently judged, scolded, shamed, or beaten down for their mistakes are not inspired to do better. They often give up, justifying their misdeeds because their hearts have become hardened. (Psychologists have a term for this: dry-eyed syndrome .) By reminding a child of the goodness of his spirit and maintaining a clear vision of who he is at his core, we help restore his faith in himself. This is far more effective in helping children develop the courage to do the right thing than threatening pun- ishment. This is not to say there should never be natural consequences for a child ’s mistakes or misdeeds. If Eliza has gone on a rampage through the house, creating upheaval because she wasn’t allowed to wear her sister’s sweater, you may decide not to take her to the park.

I don’t believe Band- Aid solutions are effective; I’m far more interested in understand- ing why a child ’s misbehavior makes its own kind of sense — and addressing it at its root — than arbitrarily delivering punishments when a child has behaved poorly. Is it normal for children to lie? question: My ten-year-old has turned into a habitual liar who makes up stories to avoid getting in trouble. I never know when he ’s telling the truth and when he ’s fibbing, so I have to assume he is lying and punish him appropriately. Of course this makes him furious when he has actually been honest. How can I tell the difference? suggestion: When a child misbehaves, I put on my detective hat and ask one of these questions: Why does his behavior make sense? What would have to be true for him to decide to lie? What pleasure is the child looking for, or what pain is he trying to avoid? What is the payoff for lying? Chances are he is avoiding the pain of getting in trouble. That makes sense, right? I often say that we teach our children how honest they can be with us based on how we react when they tell us things we don’t want to hear. What happens when your son does tell you the truth? Do you get furious? Do you express grave disappointment in him? Does he feel ashamed and embarrassed? Humiliated? This is not to say that it ’s your “fault” that your son is dishon- est, or that he shouldn’t be accountable for his deceptiveness. But when I’m working with a dishonest child, I always start by assum- ing that he is making what feels to him to be the best of two bad choices.

The more you can work toward becoming that Captain of the ship who comes across as capable of hearing difficult truths from your son, the less he will try to protect you (and himself ) by lying. You may also find it useful to read about strengthening attach- ment and connection between the two of you. When children feel liked, seen, and enjoyed by us, their natural instinct to cooperate and connect is awakened, and they find it much harder to tolerate the discomfort of being dishonest. question: My father tried his best with us kids (my mom wasn’t around), but I was an angry and wild teenager; I hung around with some tough kids and did some things I’m not proud of, like blowing up mailboxes and spraying graffiti around town.

Should I tell them about what I did? suggestion: Most of us have done things that reflect a tempo- rary loss of our moral compass. While it ’s hard to completely shake off that horrible knot in the stomach when we remember the times we acted badly, what matters most is where you are today. It sounds as if you are invested in creating a life that reflects the man you want to be, and that is what ’s most important. Far be it from me to decide what you tell your children, and when. There is no right answer to your question, at least from my vantage point. My best advice is to listen to your instincts about whether to share with your children what your earlier choices cost you. It may be beneficial to let them know the pain you feel when you call to mind some of the things you did as a teen.

There are roughly 6 , 500 spoken languages in the world today. That is a lot of variation in the way we put words to our hopes, needs, fears, and dreams. But those hopes, needs, fears, and dreams? They are essen- tially the same. We are one species stumbling around on this whirling planet, trying to survive, to keep our kids alive, and to make our time here as meaningful as possible. Sometimes I picture all of human- ity as seeds of life, scattered over the globe. We may eat different foods or have varied shades to our skin, but we are members of the same tribe. If we are to survive as a species, our children need to grow up knowing that we are interconnected at the most cellular and primal level.

In other words, even though the monkey was not personally carrying out an action, his brain responded as though it were. Scientific research now supports the notion that mirror neu- rons are triggered in our brains when someone else is sad, angry, or happy, helping us feel what the other person is feeling as though we were in her place. Mirror neurons are now thought to be vital to human empathy, allowing us to regard our fellow human beings with tenderness — feeling what they feel. In other words, we are hardwired to experience empathy. That said, I believe there are things we can do either to advance our children’s capacity to tune in to the feelings of others or to further the tendency in some to insulate themselves. Listening to Others’ Stories Not long ago my son launched a project and website called Letters to Our Former Selves , inviting people to write letters to younger versions of themselves with insights, advice, or comfort based on the perspective they had gained from being further along in their lives . The idea was to re-create the sort of conversations around the fire that humankind has shared for millennia. His initial inten- tion was to create a place for the cross-pollination of wisdom, where he and his peers might learn from their elders — and per- haps those elders could learn a thing or two from the youngsters.

He was barely three when we first took him to India; we went again when he was seven and again when he was ten. When he was fif- teen, I took him on a two-and-a-half-month trip to Uganda, Tanza- nia, Australia, and New Zealand to explore, learn, and volunteer. In college he spent a semester living with a family in Senegal. I know that these experiences helped him become a compassionate young man, comfortable with people from all walks of life. But reading letters written with such raw vulnerability has significantly awakened his own. He finishes conversations more often with, “I love you.” Sometimes he calls just to thank me for talking him through something or putting together a great dinner. I see him making more effort to appreciate and nurture his other important relationships as well. One letter in particular really broke something open for Ari.

Honoring Our Elders Until recent times, children grew up around people of every age, from newborns to the aged and infirm. Birth and death were familiar elements of life. Elders were revered. It was a given that you would show respect for those older than you, listening to their stories and seeking out their wisdom. Today, family members are spread far and wide, and our soci- ety relegates old people to facilities where they are largely cared for by strangers. I find this deplorable. Our society throws away the elderly at inestimable expense. Children need to sit at the feet of their elders.

I have a crop of friends in their eighties and nineties who have greatly enriched my life.

Seeing a photograph of two little boys living in slavery prompted eight-year-old Vivienne Harr to do something. She decided she was going to raise money by running a lemonade stand nonstop, for 365 days straight, rain or shine. Her goal was to raise $ 100 , 000 to help put an end to child slavery. On day fifty-two, Nicholas Kristof from the New York Times showcased Vivienne, and “her moment became a movement.” She reached her goal, contributing $ 101 , 320 to Not For Sale, a leading anti- slavery organization. “When her parents said: “You did it, honey. You’re done,” Vivienne said: “Is child slavery done?” They shook their heads. “Then I am not done.” Vivienne, now ten, has catalyzed a move- ment by starting the organization Make a Stand, “a social impact brand that supports its 10 -year-old founder’s vision of a world where all 18 million enslaved children are free and safe.” When asked, “What advice would you give to kids who have dreams like you but aren’t sure they can do it?” Vivienne replied, “If you set your heart to it, you can do it. I promise: you don’t have to be big or powerful to change the world. You can be just like me.” Vivienne ’s parents could have explained to her that while her sentiments were sweet, child slavery was a complicated, grown-up For children to become conscious, confident, caring adults, they need to know that they can effect change and that they can make a positive impact on someone else’s life."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Cultivating Empathy, Vulnerability, and Compassion  problem. But they didn’t. They raised their daughter in a household that valued kindness and concern for others.

From there, they simply buoyed their daughters desire to make a difference. Free the Children is an international charity that has galva- nized more than two million young people to take practical steps toward making the world a better place. It started in 1995 when Craig Kielburger happened on a news article about a young boy in Southeast Asia who had been sold into slavery at the age of four and subsequently spent six years chained to a carpet- weaving loom. Media coverage of Iqbal’s story came to the atten- tion of those wanting to silence Iqbal, and he lost his life at the age of twelve for speaking out about the rights of children. When Craig read Iqbal’s story, he pulled together a group of his class- mates to found Free the Children. He was twelve years old at the time; his classmates were his fellow seventh-graders. Kids cannot buy a ticket to We Day, an energizing all-day event for teens born out of Free the Children that takes place in fourteen cities; instead, they earn their way through service. Tens of thousands of youth and supporters do so every year. Speak- ers have included Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Dr. Jane Goodall, Jennifer Hudson, and Magic Johnson. Young people involved with We Act have contributed 14 . 6 million hours of volunteer service. Long-term studies have found that 80 percent of alumni from these programs volunteer more than 150 hours a year, 83 percent give to charity, and a staggering 79 percent voted in the last Canadian federal election in 2011 (compared to 58 percent overall).

Every day, we wake up and face the possibility of a meltdown over shoes or dirty looks from a snarly teen. It takes courage to be a parent, and there is no elixir or magic pill that makes us brave enough. We simply have to put one foot in front of another and do our best. My hope is that as you read these chapters, you will just allow the ideas I’m sharing to become seeds in your consciousness. The last thing I want for you is to feel that you’ve fallen short by not being honest or accountable or compassionate enough. Simply do your best. Be kind. Make mistakes. Fall down. Get back up. Reach for courage. And if you can’t find any, say a prayer or ask a friend to prop you up. It ’s all one day at a time. Be kind to yourself."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence now it ’ s your turn Most humans are innately compassionate; we feel for those who are struggling and wish we could alleviate their suffering. But it is one thing to feel a momentary wave of concern for the plight of those less fortunate, and another to take action. We ’re all so busy; when you add children into the mix of an average parent ’s day, there is hardly time to sit down for a proper meal, let alone organize an outing with our kids to give back to others. Still, when we stretch our imaginations, we can often find ways to participate with our children in projects that leave us feel- ing we made a meaningful contribution to the lives of others. Consider the causes that move you. Some areas include ani- mals, arts, the disabled, seniors, politics, veterans, literacy, the environment, the homeless, and hunger. Think about your chil- dren and what need or cause they might be most naturally drawn toward. Or consider what lights your fire. Kids often get on board with volunteering because their parent is enthusiastic about a par- ticular cause. In your journal, write one or two ways you and your kids might dedicate a little time to giving back. It may be assembling Christmas packages for families in need or writing letters to troops overseas. It could be taking the family dog to an assisted- living center, or volunteering to tutor kids with reading problems.

He is also a worrier. I like to volunteer with him, but he practically falls apart afterward. When we helped feed homeless people over the hol- idays, he worried that our family could end up homeless. When we babysat for a mom at his school who was dealing with chemo- therapy, he obsessed about whether his mommy would get cancer. I think he does feel very good about helping others, but he gets swept up in their suffering. suggestion: Oh, these dear, sensitive kids! Their filters are so thin that for them sounds are louder, lights are brighter, and feel- ings are more intense. I have worked with many highly sensitive children and con- sistently find that these kids do best with volunteer opportunities that are less fraught with pain and tragedy. Consider letting your son help out a housebound neighbor by weeding her garden or walking her dog. He might enjoy volunteering to play with little kids at a local nursery school. If your son is a nature lover, he might want to do trail restoration at a local park. We cannot keep our children in a bubble, nor is it in their best interests. Little by little we need to expose children to some of the complicated and difficult truths about how life is for many of our fellow inhabitants on Earth. But we can be respectful of our child ’s heightened sensitivity so as to avoid overwhelming him with sorrow and anxiety.

Both types are essential to the survival of the tribe. The impulsive ones push the clan to explore new territories, while the sensitive souls point out pos- sible dangers that might otherwise be ignored, such as almost imperceptible scratch marks on a tree, suggesting that bears might be wandering nearby. Don’t give up on looking for ways to let your little guy make a contribution, but do be sensitive to his sen- sitivities. What if we do care about our son’s grades? question: I like the letter to Chase that you quoted from, but my wife and I do care about whether our son gets As in school or wins a prize at the science fair. Don’t you think it ’s important to encourage our children to excel? suggestion: Absolutely! We all feel good when we know we ’ve done our best. The problem is, when a child grows up focused on winning the approval of others, she loses the satisfaction that comes when she knows in her heart of hearts that she has done well — even if no one else has noticed. Ours is a very externally focused, achievement-driven cul- ture. It is true that it ’s a competitive world, and that kids who have some degree of drive and persistence do better than those who are unmotivated. But if children think that we care most about the A or the honor roll, they may lose sight of the accomplishments that aren’t so easily measured or acknowledged. I have found that when children learn to be self-referential — meaning they check in with themselves to see how they feel about something rather than reflexively looking outside themselves to determine whether they’ve done well — they are much stron- ger at the core. These kids are clearer in their convictions, less"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Cultivating Empathy, Vulnerability, and Compassion  vulnerable to the influence of their peers, and more willing to do the right thing, even if it is unpopular. Help your children discover the joy of hard work — yes! But let them know that even if there are no prizes, gold stars, or trophies, doing and being their best is rewarding in and of itself. Is it possible to teach kids to like volunteering? question: My children don’t seem to have any interest in volun- teering or helping others. Their school requires them to do com- munity service, but my kids do the quickest, easiest thing possible. They aren’t bad kids, but they are very self-centered and they think it ’s unfair that they have to do even a few hours of giving back each semester. Can you really teach children to feel for oth- ers if they don’t come by that quality naturally? suggestion: I have mixed feelings about community-service programs. Overall, I think they are better than nothing, but I agree that you cannot legislate kindness or force someone to feel goodwill toward others. These are internal states of conscious- ness that arise when we come to understand that we are all pas- sengers in the same boat. Look for an activity that you can do as a family — one that has some natural appeal. Many kids like animals or feel special when they get to be a big kid around smaller children. Volunteer at a community garden that donates food to shelters, or volunteer to help out at a fundraiser. The more you make helping others what you do — perhaps a few hours each month — the less your kids will gripe about it. Evan, a seventeen-year-old high school senior from Malibu, asked to come in for a session with me.

He said he was getting impressive grades, had a terrific girlfriend, was an athletic star, and had been given carte blanche with his father’s credit card. And he was depressed. Evan told me that in one of his classes he had been given the assignment of tallying up his cash outlays for a week. He was stunned to discover that in seven days he had spent more than a thousand dollars. “I realized that my life is all about getting stuff or hanging out with friends or being on my phone so I won’t miss anything cool. It ’s all about me.” I asked him what he did that gave him a sense of meaning or purpose. He sat quietly for a while and then responded, “Nothing.” We talked about a variety of ways to address his depression, but he was most eager to explore how he might inject more mean- ing into his life. By the end of our time together, his mood had lifted considerably. Evan showed real excitement about looking for ways to make his life less about himself, starting with simply being more of an active participant in his family’s life instead of just being on the receiving end of his parents’ largesse. I hope you are able to find ways to make the practice of giving to others a regular part of your family’s lives in a way that feels enjoyable and gratifying.

Days were spent exploring woods or fi elds, riding bikes to nowhere in particular, and playing outside until dark. We built towns out of rocks and dirt or converted refrigerator boxes into castles and spaceships. Of course, abuse and neglect were some- times a sad and secret part of a seemingly idyllic life. But children spent their time differently in the not-so-distant past. We were all in less of a hurry. Today’s kids carry the weight of the world on their backs. They are urged to excel in school, perform impressively in their extracurricular activities, manage complicated relationships (both real and cyber), and compete to get into a good college or fi nd a decent job. In 2012 it was revealed that 125 Harvard students had been involved in a cheating scandal.

And according to the Journal of Adolescent Health, most teens are getting at least two hours less sleep than is recommended for good health. In a study titled “Stress in America,” commissioned by the American Psychological Association, it was found that 30 per- cent of teens reported feeling over- whelmed, depressed, or sad as a result of stress. Almost 25 percent said they skipped meals because of stress. \t Almost one-third of teens say that stress often brings them to the verge of tears. In the past sixty years, the suicide rate has quadrupled for males fifteen to twenty-four years old, and doubled for females of the same age. Suicide rates for those between the ages of ten and fourteen increased more than 50 percent between 1981 and 2006 . The American Academy of Pediatrics released a study noting that stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline can have a significant long-term impact on a teen’s body, potentially contrib- uting to adult cardiovascular disease, asthma, viral hepatitis, and autoimmune diseases. Stress can unleash chemicals that interfere with the development of neuronal networks in the developing brain as well as inhibit the development of new neurons in grow- ing brains. The real-life evidence of these statistics regularly shows up in my office. Eight-year-olds whose parents bring them because they have been saying they want to kill themselves. Fourteen- year-olds who use cutting to ease their anxiety and unhappiness. Kids who can’t sleep, can’t eat, are withdrawn, tearful, or afraid of being alone.

As parents we have a dramatic influence on our children’s beliefs about what matters. If we teach them that external achieve- ment is what we care most about, they will naturally look for shortcuts to get ahead — cheating on tests or cutting back on sleep. They need to know that we want them to live with curi- osity, excitement, and enthusiasm, and that we are here to enjoy life, not to push and shove our way through it. When author Geneen Roth inter- viewed financial advisors, they told her that without exception, every client they worked with who had managed to reach their initial financial goal raised the bar and aimed for something higher. Whatever they had acquired never felt like enough once they had it. They always ended up wanting more. Connecting in Real Life A significant contributor to stress is isolation or disconnection. Michael Price, in an interview with Sherry Turkle, author of Alone Together, writes, “People today are more connected to one another than ever before in human history, thanks to Internet-based social networking sites and text messaging. But they’re also more lonely and distant from one another in their unplugged lives. This is not only changing the way we interact online, it ’s straining our per- sonal relationships, as well.” Turkle tells Price, “When teens tell me that they’d rather text than talk, they are expressing another aspect of the new psychological affordances of the new technol- ogy — the possibility of our hiding from each other. They say a Our kids need to know that we want them to live with curiosity, excitement, and enthusiasm, and that we are here to enjoy life, not to push and shove our way through it."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence phone call reveals too much, that actual conversations don’t give them enough control over what they want to say.” Kids step out of school to see their parents looking down at their smartphones. Boys who once chatted with dad between plays as they watched sports now wait while he checks his email instead. Little ones are nursed or bottle-fed while mommy texts, diluting the emotional exchange of this primal, intimate contact. In addition, if mom gets a message that generates anxiety, her tense feelings are communicated to the baby, who experiences them as stress in his relationship with mommy rather than because of outside influences. In her book Thrive , Arianna Huffington shared the follow- ing story: “The last time my mother got angry with me before she died was when she saw me reading my email and talking to my children at the same time. ‘I abhor multitasking,’ she said, in a Greek accent that puts mine to shame. In other words, being connected in a shallow way to the entire world can prevent us from being deeply connected to those closest to us — including ourselves. And that is where wisdom is found.” Connection helps to prevent stress. Nothing fortifies a child like genuine connection with a loved one. In my previous book, I detailed the six stages of attachment that children move through in the first six years of their life, as described by Dr. Gordon Neufeld. We can deepen our attachment with our children throughout their lives with these six inroads, providing our child with one of life ’s most effective antidotes to stress: healthy con- nection. The newborn begins its journey of attachment through prox- imity , connecting with us through smell, touch, and the sound Nothing fortifies a child like genuine connection with a loved one."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Helping Our Kids Cope with Stress  of our voice. At around two, our toddler wants to be like us — this stage is sameness and contributes to a child ’s acquisition of language. The next stage is belonging or loyalty and sees the three- year-old pushing a sibling off mommy’s lap, possessively declar- ing, “ My mommy!” When our child is around the age of four, we strengthen attachment as we acknowledge and celebrate who our child uniquely is during the stage called significance . Connection goes deeper around five, through the stage of love when children begin to offer us their little hearts. And if all has gone well, from six on up, we build on a solid foundation of attachment through the stage of being known. We make it clear to our child that we are capable of hearing her truth, providing support as that calm Cap- tain of the ship, regardless of the storm she may be sailing through. Children who have durable, reli- able attachments with healthy loved ones are much better able to cope with life ’s stressors. Author Johann Hari cites research suggesting addiction is a result of disconnection, not just chem- istry. “If we can’t connect with each other, we will connect with anything we can find — the whirr of a roulette wheel or the prick of a syringe.” He quotes professor Peter Cohen, who says, “We should stop talking about ‘addiction’ altogether, and instead call it ‘bonding.’ A heroin addict has bonded with heroin because she couldn’t bond as fully with anything else.” Hari goes on to say that “the opposite of addiction is not sobriety. It is human con- nection.” There will always be youngsters who have close relationships with their parents but who still struggle mightily with adver- sity, but generally speaking, attachment with a loving parent Children who have durable, reliable attachments with healthy loved ones are much better able to cope with life’s stressors."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence or caregiver offers children a huge advantage in mitigating the stresses of life. Managing Change and Uncertainty One of life ’s greatest certainties is uncertainty . The more we can make peace with the fact that some things are outside our control, the less helpless we will feel when life isn’t going according to plan. Demonstrating that we can be flexible in unexpected situa- tions helps our children know that they, too, can tolerate being in limbo while they wait for more to be revealed. I remember once sitting in an air- port in Nairobi with my then fifteen- year-old son. It was midnight, and we had just been told that we would not be allowed to board our flight for Austra- lia because the airline did not recognize our electronic visas. Ari started to get nervous; we had no contacts in Nairobi, had been up for nearly twenty-four hours traveling from Tanzania, and depar- ture time was fast approaching. As concerned as I was, I tried to stay relaxed, knowing that how I dealt with the situation was likely to influence how my son handled similar events later on in his life. I suggested that we make friends with the worst-case scenario. We started talking about things we could do if we were waylaid, reminding ourselves that even if we had to wait in Nairobi a day or two for a traditional visa to come through, we would be okay. Moments before our flight was ready to depart, the airline received a fax from the Australian consulate, and we were permit- ted to board. But by then we were confident that if we didn’t make Demonstrating that we can be flexible in unexpected situations helps our children know that they, too, can tolerate being in limbo while they wait for more to be revealed."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Helping Our Kids Cope with Stress  our flight, we would simply have a different few days than we ’d planned, and that we would be okay. But helping our children isn’t just about teaching them how to cope when things aren’t going well. It is also about infusing their days with enjoyment. Having Fun It is said that the average four-year-old laughs three hundred times a day; a forty-year-old, only four. In his landmark book Anatomy of an Illness, Norman Cousins described how watching just ten minutes of Marx Brothers movies reduced the pain and inflammation from his arthritis and gave him hours of pain-free sleep. Laughter reduces stress hormones, boosts endorphins, im- proves the flow of blood to the heart, increases the number of natural virus-killing cells, and makes us more resistant to disease. It improves our mood and attitude, and solidifies bonds between people. Laughter and fun are wonderful ways to combat stress. Anne Lamott says, “Laughter is carbonated holiness.” Music can also be a terrific way of getting out of our heads and into our hearts. Try playing “Oh What a Beautiful Morning” when you’re waking the kids in the morning, or Pharrell Williams’s “Happy” as you all dance your way to dinner. A small change of state can make a big impact. In chapter 11 you’ll find ideas for adding more fun and laughter to your daily life. Our attitudes about life can make or break our children’s stress levels. It isn’t always easy to know when we should encour- age them to forge through obstacles, and when to teach them that it ’s okay to let go and chalk up something as a life lesson. But as with every aspect of parenting, how we navigate the twists and turns in our lives will influence how our children handle their own."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence Persisting Motivating our children to keep trying when success eludes them is invaluable. It is vital that they develop the inner resources to push through stumbling blocks when it would be easier to throw in the towel. But there is a difference between pursuing dreams with passion and joy and trying to force something to happen when it isn’t meant to be. Our kids need to under- stand that when they don’t attain a hoped-for goal, they can try another approach, take a pause in their pursuit, or let go. Not manifesting a particular outcome is not failure, and failure is not fatal. Stum- bling along, tripping, and falling is often how we get to where we ’re going. Let your kids understand that although we might have pref- erences, we can be at peace when life doesn’t go the way we had planned . How does your child see you react to the news that you’ve missed your flight? Do you look for someone to blame? What do they watch you do when you are told that your car needs a major repair? Do you curse and stomp your feet? Make it evi- dent that when something unexpected happens, you can roll with it. Let them hear you asking the question, “Will this be an issue in five years — or two days?” By letting your children see you putting those bumps in the road into a larger context, they will be inclined to do the same. But if you think that to be okay a situation must unfold exactly as you think it should, you will feel power- less. And powerlessness leads to stress. There are some who believe that we coddle our children far too much, insulating them from the inevitable bumps and bruises of life by doing everything for them. A story ran a few years ago about a college student who, instead of calling 911 when she dis- covered a fire in her dorm, called her mother to ask her what she Stumbling along, tripping, and falling is often how we get to where we’re going."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Helping Our Kids Cope with Stress  should do. And certainly there is much to say about the helicopter parent who hovers anxiously over her child to make sure every answer on her math sheet is correct or who calls the mother of a friend to “correct an oversight” because her daughter wasn’t invited to a birthday party. But there is a difference between cod- dling and nurturing. Coddling is a manifestation of our own anxi- ety; we micromanage our child ’s experiences in the hopes that we will not have to see them distressed or unhappy. Nurturing is an act of love — it involves connecting and being lovingly attuned with our child. The pressures that kids face today are exceptional, and as stress levels continue to climb, we need to help our youngsters develop good coping strategies. Paying Attention to Your Child’s Stress If you have a child who is exhibiting ongoing signs of stress or its cousins — anxiety and depression — please don’t look the other way. Make sure your kids know that whatever they are going through, they can tell you the truth. In my online workshops and trainings I devote a significant amount of time to working with parents so that they don’t send their kids a mixed message: You can tell me anything. Wait a minute — you did what?! You’re in big trouble! Our kids will test us to see if we mean it when we say we want them to come to us if they’re feeling worried or stressed, leaking out little grievances to see if we are indeed capa- ble of hearing what ’s going on with them. Will we be that confi- dent, calm Captain of the ship, or will we leap overboard when our children reveal something that troubles them? If we are to help our kids manage stress and restore their equilibrium when life feels hard, we need to do our own work so that we can honestly tell them, “Whatever you’re going through, sweetheart, I’m here and I will help you through this.”"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence If we are to help our kids manage stress and restore their equilibrium when life feels hard, we need to do our own work so that we can honestly tell them, “Whatever you’re going through, sweetheart, I’m here and I will help you through this.” Practicing Mindfulness “When my sister wore my favorite sweater, I tore up her home- work. I was so mad! ” — Caroline “My mind tells me things that make me worry, like I’m going to mess up on my oral report and then everybody will laugh at me. I can’t stop my thoughts.” — David “I saw a picture online of my friends at a sleepover that I hadn’t been invited to. I ended up cutting my leg, I felt so left out and sad.” — Tiffany “I felt really bad when I didn’t get the highest score in my class. When I got in my mom’s car, I started yelling at her, and then I started crying.” — Henry By now it should be clear that adults aren’t the only ones who experience chronic and serious stress. Teens and even young chil- dren benefit greatly from learning strategies to help them cope when life isn’t going their way. From improving emotional regu- lation to managing impulsivity, teaching kids how to slow down and reconnect to the present moment gives them an enormous leg up in terms of leading a happier life, both now and into adulthood. Margaret was a teacher at a school that had implemented a program allowing every student to learn a mindfulness practice. Watching how positively it affected her third-grade students, she decided to try it out with her seven-year-old son, who had recently been diagnosed with ADHD. “I bought a meditation bell and before bed, we closed our eyes, rang the bell, and listened as it faded, while we imagined ourselves floating on a cloud. Some- times, if he gets really mad at his brother, I hear him ringing that"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Helping Our Kids Cope with Stress  bell upstairs to calm himself down!” She went on to tell me that, like her classroom students, her son was more focused and less fidgety. “Mindfulness practice takes just minutes, and it is really making a difference for these kids.” The term mindfulness has gained traction across ages, gen- der, and demographics. Simply put, it involves paying attention to what is going on in the present moment with curiosity and nonjudgmental awareness. Eckhart Tolle prefers to use the term presence: “Mindful seems to imply that the mind is full when the opposite is actually the case.” Others use words such as heartful or heightened awareness . For the purposes of this book, I will use the word mindful to represent the quiet, nonthinking awareness that allows us to rest deeply below the surface of whatever external events are cre- ating agitation or stress. These practices involve using senses — sound, feeling, breath — to anchor to the present moment rather than becoming lost in thoughts about the past or future. Mindfulness helps children pause before reacting to a stress- ful situation and to handle difficulties more flexibly. It empow- ers kids to be less reactive to their thoughts, teaching them that thoughts are just thoughts and, just like the sky is so spacious that it is unperturbed by the presence of clouds, we don’t have to be dragged down by every thought-cloud that passes through our awareness. Thoughts come, they stay awhile, and then they disperse. One way that mindfulness teachers illustrate this idea to chil- dren is by filling a jar with water and sand or baking soda, putting on the lid, and then having the children shake up the jar to watch the “storm.” When the ingredients settle down, they see that the sand or baking soda has settled to the bottom and the water is clear Mindfulness involves paying attention to what is going on in the present moment with curiosity and nonjudgmental awareness."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence again. This is very much what happens with our minds. When we get quiet for a few moments, the storm of our thoughts settles down, and we can think and act more consciously. In families and schools where mindfulness is being taught, children manage their frustration more successfully. In addition, children tend to be more compassionate, cooperative, and patient. Children who were restless learn to be more comfortable in their skin. Kids plagued by anxiety discover that despite their tendency to worry over real or imagined threats, in the present moment, there is no danger. This helps them reestablish emotional equilib- rium when they might otherwise fall apart. Mindfulness is being introduced in every type of setting, with tremendous results. Former LA Lakers basketball coach Phil Jackson won eleven NBA championships, crediting his wins in part to his use of mindfulness practices. He used to have his play- ers sit in stillness to build their mental strength, and even had Silence Days during which there was no speaking at all. When a player was having a tough time on the court, he could regroup with a mindfulness practice on the bench. Congressman Tim Ryan and others have instituted mindfulness programs for veter- ans, resulting in a notable reduction in PTSD symptoms. Prisons have started using mindfulness to heal and transform lives, pre- vent crime, and reduce recidivism. More than six thousand staff, three thousand parents, and forty thousand students have gone through Linda Lantieri’s Inner Resilience Program. She developed this program as a way to help New York City teachers cope with trauma and burnout after 9 / 11 by introducing meditation, yoga, and time for inner work and reflection. “Because all of those steps we take for outer-prepared- ness could fall apart. But what we have inside us is not going to break down. We have it in us no matter what.” I have had great success introducing children and their"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Helping Our Kids Cope with Stress  parents to simple mindfulness practices. A side benefit is the way everyone becomes a little more heart centered. One day I was in the middle of a particularly difficult session with a mother and her fifteen-year-old daughter. Mom was trying to lay down the law around a house rule that her daughter had broken, and her daughter was radiating malevolence and anger. I asked them, “Would you two mind if we took a break in this conversation and hit the Reset button?” Both agreed; the tension in the room was thick, and we all needed a pause. I invited them to close their eyes and proceeded to walk them through a short mindfulness exercise. First I asked them to pay attention to their breath, noticing where they sensed it — per- haps in their nostrils as the air flowed past, or at the back of their throat, or maybe in the rising and falling of their chest or stomach. After a moment of this, I asked them to pay attention to whatever sounds they were hearing. “It might be the wind in the trees, or perhaps you’ll hear a car driving down the road. You may notice the ticking of a clock, or just the sound of your breath. If your attention wanders, gently bring it back to registering the sounds around you.” We did this exercise for about three minutes. As we wound down, I suggested that they sit quietly for a moment with their eyes closed, allowing their eyes to open when they were ready. As soon as we looked at one another, I knew things had changed. Both reported feeling much more centered and calm — surprisingly so, after just a few short minutes. The temperature in the room, emotionally speaking, had cooled way down. As we resumed our discussion, there was more openness and less rigidity around their respective positions.

Most of us like to believe that our kids will come to us when they have difficulties. But we often make it hard for our youngsters to offload their upsets, teaching them by our reactivity that it isn’t safe to reveal the truth about what they’re going through. If a child tells us that he was caught cheating on a test, or our fourteen-year-old reveals that she is thinking of having sex with her boyfriend, we may find ourselves shouting, threatening, or advising, demonstrating that in fact we really can’t handle the truth about some of the things our kids are struggling with. Reflect on how you respond when your child tells you some- thing you don’t want to hear. Are you calm and open-minded? Do you get angry or start giving advice? Do you try to fix things rather than letting your youngster off-load whatever she ’s feel- ing? Do you punish or bully? Do you effectively shut down the conversation, leaving your child feeling that the next time she is facing a stressful situation she should discuss it with her friends instead of with you? It isn’t always easy, but helping our kids know they can turn to us for support goes a long way toward helping them sail through whatever stormy seas might be creating stress in their lives. In your journal, write about how safe you make it for your child to come to you when he is stressed about something.

I knew he was crushed and tried to tell him it was for the best and that he would find someone else, but he completely shut me out. I feel terrible hearing you talk about the importance of attachment in helping children through stress, because we are so disconnected. How can we help him if he has completely withdrawn from us? suggestion: As I said earlier, we teach our children whether or not it is safe to reveal what ’s going on in their lives by how we respond when they open up to us. When we react with advice or appear desperately unhappy about their unhappiness, they learn to guard their secrets lest they risk having not only to handle their stress but also the pressure of our upset about their problems. Rebuilding connection takes patience and time, but it can be done. While your sixteen-year-old is at a stage when kids pull away to separate from their parents, this does not mean your son doesn’t need you. However, if you come at him with the aroma of neediness — desperate to know the details of his life or trip- ping over yourself to restore his happiness — he will instinctively retreat. Look for small, less intrusive opportunities to connect. Per- haps your son will be interested in helping you whip up a new dessert.

When I try to convince her to stay out of upsetting arguments, she says I don’t understand. She ends up losing sleep sometimes because of hurt- ful posts directed either at her or at one of her friends. suggestion: It is almost impossible for kids to navigate the social complexities of their online world. In a sense, it is uncharted territory for parents as well. How do we set boundaries or provide just the right amount of supervision so that our youngsters enjoy what goes on in Cyberville without becoming confused, hurt, or even tormented? Let your daughter know that you agree — you can’t know how much is at stake for her when it comes to her online friend- ships but that you want to help her be less affected when things start turning ugly. Instead of giving her advice she isn’t asking for (I call this crashing the party ), ask your daughter to explain how you can best help her; let her tell you what kind of support she needs when she ’s struggling. If she just wants to unload, let her do that. If she learns that you can listen without becoming preachy, she is more likely to let you weigh in with your counsel. If you manage to build her trust enough that she lets down her guard, proceed with caution. Demonstrate curiosity. “You seem so mad when people make fun of something you’ve posted. Can you help me understand what makes you want to keep checking your page when you’re pretty sure there are just going to be hurt- ful comments?” Or, “Sweetheart, I wonder if it helps Cassie when"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence you start defending her by posting mean things to kids when they attack her, or whether it would mean more to her if you unplugged your computer and just called her up to see how she ’s doing.” I think all parents are flying by the seat of their pants when it comes to helping kids navigate the digital world. It starts with being sensible. If your daughter was spending time at a local hangout and consistently came home bruised or crying, you would address the problem at its root rather than just forbidding her to set foot outside the house. Help her feel you are her ally rather than an outside controlling force only interested in limiting her fun. How can I help my son the perfectionist? question: How do you help kids know when they should try their hardest and when they should let go? As glad as I am that my twelve-year-old son tries his best, I sometimes wish he wouldn’t insist on trying to make his assignments perfect. He obsesses over every detail. My wife and I worry about how he ’s going to handle high school if he gets this stressed over sixth-grade homework. suggestion: Some children seem to have been born with a per- fectionistic streak. Try as we might, it is hard to convince them to lighten up about things that matter to them. But many kids seem to mimic one or both parents’ need for perfection, internalizing the idea that good has to be great, and great has to be fantabulous. Tell your son that you would like to understand what it ’s like when the voice in his head pushes him on, even when he is tired or burnt out. “What is that like for you, to know that you’ve done a terrific job and you still feel unsatisfied?” When you demon- strate that you want to visit his planet and get a better feel for what he ’s up against — without judging or criticizing him — he may become more open and, eventually, more receptive to your guidance."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Helping Our Kids Cope with Stress  It could also be that your son is something of an “approval junkie,” clamoring for attention or praise from his teachers. If this is the case, look at what he gains from special approval that he might be able to get in another way. There is nothing wrong with wanting to impress a teacher with a job well done, but if it is causing undue stress, the underlying need is best addressed in another way. If you feel your son is taking his perfectionistic cues from you or your wife, make a point of modeling more balance. When you’re working on a project, let him see you acknowledging that although you could probably make it better, good enough is good enough. Take a break, call it a day, and let go.

I actually had no idea what a discourse was, but the fi rst line stayed with me for the rest of my life: “Say, ‘I do not want anything’ and be happy.” As young and inexperienced as I was, this idea resonated all the way down to my bones; I knew it was true, even if I wasn’t entirely sure I understood what it meant or how to go about embodying it. Countless luminaries have said the same thing — that the key to happiness lies in freeing oneself from desire. When we are at peace with life just as it is, we liber- ate ourselves to experience true joy. I believe that with all my heart. This does not mean we should raise our children to drift through life with- out honoring the nudges and longings of their spirit.

In his lectures, he explains that if we ’re too focused on becoming we lose the ability to enjoy the present moment, fall- ing into patterns of stress, anxiety, and never feeling fulfilled. But if we only stay in a state of being , we are not very effective in the world. Eckhart describes this as going below thought , explain- ing that if we abandon all striving, we can actually lose a sense of alertness, which is part of being present. We need to maintain a balance between being and doing for life to be enjoyable and fruitful. But living in a culture that tempts us with an endless parade of things that promise to make us really happy makes maintaining that balance easier said than done. And raising kids who don’t desperately want one thing or another? Quite challenging. Our children are bombarded with the promise of popularity, approval, status, or pleasure if they can acquire something that is usually just out of reach. “If I just get an A on that test . . . If Cameron tells Caitlyn that he does like me . . . If you guys would buy me a newer iPad with a better camera . . .” This calls to mind a survey by Pew Research Center in which, when asked what they aspired to be, 81 percent of eighteen- to twenty-five-year-olds responded that what they most wanted to be was rich.

Everything looks great from the outside — the shiny red apple — but inside is a worm, eating away at their soul. As I was leafing through a copy of Architectural Digest, fea- turing impeccably designed houses — dreamy kitchens, show- case living rooms, hand-crafted furniture, and every pillow placed just so — I started thinking about the families living in these homes. Certainly some of the residents move through the sumptuous rooms in appreciation and delight. But I have known people who spent years manifesting their dream home and ended up facing the painful truth that happiness is not for sale; heart- ache still seeped in. Maybe the family doesn’t gather around the massive stone fireplace in the cathedral-ceilinged imported oak– beamed living room to share laughs and play games in the eve- nings. Maybe the kids routinely sulk in their designer bedrooms, miserably consumed with trying to impress their online friends. The house might be worthy of envy, but not the lives being lived within its walls. There is nothing wrong with enjoying the finer things in life, and many wealthy people live gratifying lives filled with love, joy and purpose. I just want to highlight that worldly success and happiness do not go hand in hand. The elements that contribute to a fulfilling life go far beyond what money can buy. Making Peace with Not Getting All We Want When we understand that happiness is not something we can buy, we become more at ease with our children’s complaints when they can’t have something they want. But rather than criticizing them for not being grateful enough, we should help them navi- gate through their disappointment, validating their feelings and guiding them toward acceptance.

Oh, how he wanted that card! It would have been so easy to buy his smile. But we had set a dollar limit, and the card far exceeded it. I felt terrible. He wanted it so much. What would be the harm in giving in? But I wanted him to know that I had faith in his ability to weather the storm of not getting what he wanted. I tried to be kind and understanding; “I know how badly you want it, sweetheart. I know it doesn’t seem fair.” But somehow I held my ground. As hard as it was, I believe not getting what he wanted helped him learn that his happiness wasn’t dependent on mommy pulling out her credit card. As I said, wanting is not in and of itself a negative thing. Desire and longing are often whispers from our soul, indicating the direction we should take in our life. Why would an athlete spend grueling days working out and perfecting his ability if he didn’t long to be his best? How would I have learned Hindi if I had ignored my desire to do so? It is only when pining for something sucks the oxygen out of today by promising us a better tomorrow that it becomes a problem. Help your children learn the difference between the monkey mind ’s endless demands for “stuff ” and the genuine yearnings of their soul. It is a gift to be attuned to the call of the heart. The trick is in not put- ting all the eggs in the basket of “Some- day, I’ll be happy, if and only if . . .” The journey is the destination, even when we aspire to great heights. We are meant to not only reach for the stars, but to enjoy the ride.

Helping our children live more joyful lives also requires that we teach them to challenge negative habits and thinking patterns — changing our happiness set point, or our default capacity for feeling joy. Changing Our Happiness Set Point Researchers in positive psychology believe that we have a hap- piness “set point” — a subjective level of well-being that stays relatively constant. Lottery winners tend to revert back to their happiness set point even after winning millions of dollars, as do those who have suffered a great loss. My friend Marci Shimoff says that this set point is determined by three things: genetics ( 50 percent), habits ( 40 percent), and circumstances ( 10 percent.) At first glance, this might suggest that if you were unfortunate in the genetic lottery and inherited genes biased toward “glass half empty,” there is a 50 percent chance that you will be destined to live an unhappy life. But such is not the case. Epigeneticists have determined that changing our habits can actually change our DNA. Dr. David Rakel states: “Epigenetics means ‘around the gene ’ or if you will, the soup in which we bathe our genes is determined by human choice. . . . We have a choice to bathe our genes with joy, happiness, exercise, and nutritious foods, or we can bathe them with anger, lack of hope, junk food and seden- tary lifestyle.” In other words, regardless of our circumstances or genetics, we can cultivate happiness. It is said that we think about sixty thousand thoughts each day. It is also said that about 80 percent of them are negative. And it is believed that about 95 percent of the thoughts we think today are more or less the same ones that we thought yesterday, the day before, and the day before that. This means that if we don’t change"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence our habitual way of thinking, we will be drenched in about forty-five thousand negative thoughts each and every day. That ’s a pretty negative soup for our genes to be swimming around in! When NIH researchers measured blood flow and activity patterns in the brain, they discovered that negative thoughts stimulate areas involved in anxiety and depression, acting like a poison on our system. The best way to help our kids develop healthy habits of happiness is to adopt them ourselves. Do your children see you falling into a negative “what if ” spi- ral when life deals you a difficult hand, or do you try to whistle a happy tune as you do your best to make lemonade out of lemons? Naturally, you may prefer that your car transmission doesn’t break down or that the rain lets up before your outdoor party. But there is a difference between preferences and needs. When we need some- thing, we step into a place of powerlessness, fueling desperation and the unhealthy behaviors that come with trying to control a partic- ular outcome because we cannot imagine enduring the alternative. When our children see us acknowledging disappointment without flinging ourselves headlong into unhappiness, they de- velop a picture of what it looks like to remain present through life ’s rough patches — a way of being that they can refer back to when they encounter their own challenges. Reaching within for Happiness When some of us think of happiness, we picture a quarterback doing the happy dance after making a touchdown, or a bride beaming with delight as she walks down the aisle. These moments are indeed special, but they are relatively few and far between. They are also dependent on external circumstances. If we don’t change our habitual way of thinking, we will be drenched in about forty-five thousand negative thoughts each and every day."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Happiness Is an Inside Job  True happiness is quiet and deep. It is not dependent on cir- cumstance. It isn’t something we get by manifesting a longed- for event or achievement. Instead, it is a state we settle into that infuses the moments of our life — ordi- nary and extraordinary alike — with deep joy. Author Barbara De Angelis tells a personal story that made quite an impact on me. I’d like to paraphrase it here. After years of searching, she met a man she believed to be her soul mate. They fell deeply in love, and she marveled at her good fortune. As they walked hand in hand on the beach, Barbara’s heart overflowed with happiness. Her sweet- heart sent her passionate love letters. She moved through her days saturated in a kind of romantic bliss she had never known. Some months later, she discovered that this man was actually seeing several other women. Adding insult to injury, he had sent them the same love letters he had written to her. She was shat- tered. How could a love that had felt so true and deep have been a sham? Brokenhearted, she shut off the world and plunged into a deep, dark hole. After some time in this dismal condition, something shook loose inside of her, and she had an epiphany. If her entire expe- rience of love had been based on a falsehood, why had she felt so much happiness? She began to understand that the joy and love she had experienced in this man’s presence, and whenever she thought about him, had been inside her all the time. He didn’t hand her a chunk of love whenever they were together. He didn’t give her a pill that opened the floodgates of her heart. Instead, his expressions of affection had simply prompted her to turn on the faucet of joy within herself. It was her opening the faucet that allowed her to experience magnificent love, not something he did. True happiness is quiet and deep. It is a state we settle into that infuses the moments of our life — ordinary and extraordinary alike — with deep joy."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence In truth, her boyfriend had simply been the excuse she needed to allow herself to experience feelings of love that always had been in her heart. What I love about this story is the way it exposes a lie that many of us perpetuate: that our happiness is dependent on some- thing or someone else. When you reflect on times when you have been steeped in joy, you may first remember what was going on externally; perhaps your loved ones were all gathered together, or you were taking a walk in the woods. But while those conditions are important, the feeling of happi- ness was humming within you. True happiness is self-generated; it is a feeling we can tap into regardless of what is going on exter- nally. What a wonderful gift it would be if we could help our chil- dren understand that happiness really is an inside job! When we open our hearts to ap- preciate whatever the present moment is delivering, reaching for a piece of bread can catalyze as much happiness as reviewing a list of things that we are grateful for — an essential lesson to teach our kids. There is an ever-present river flow- ing inside of us that we can always step into. Real happiness is about enjoying the simple miracle of being alive. Expressing Appreciation Appreciation is not something we can teach our children through words, but if we create habits of gratitude, they cannot help but be affected. Expressing appreciation regularly helps us shift away from fixating on what ’s wrong to celebrating what is wonderful.

In the course of his research on marital stability, he came up with a technique that is useful not only in marriages but also in other family relationships: establishing a ratio of five apprecia- tions to every one negative comment. He suggests that whenever you make a complaint, you should neutralize its impact with five positive acknowledgments or ap- preciations. Harville Hendrix, creator with his wife of Imago Relationship Therapy, talks about this idea as well, encouraging couples to shift from patterns of communication that harm to ones that uplift. I have had great success working with families to integrate this idea into their daily lives; children (and parents!) love hearing the things we like or appreciate about them. If, out of frustration, you find yourself saying something like, “Why do you always make so much noise when you eat?” you can sprinkle positive comments throughout the day, such as, “I loved how gen- tly you played with the puppies, sweetheart” or “When I pulled into the driveway and saw you playing outside, I was so happy to see you, and so glad to be your dad!” Offering appreciations to those we love is like lubricating an engine; it reduces friction and makes family life run more smoothly. Answering Your Child’s Big Questions about Life The words spiritual and spirituality carry a multitude of meanings. Here I am using them not in a religious or dogmatic sense but to describe the longing we are born with to understand how we came to be alive, what power or force (if any) is running the show, and why we are here in the first place. We human beings seem to come with a preprogrammed yearning to understand the mystery"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence of life. We look beyond rational explanations for a deeper frame- work for understanding the universe, and our place in it. Your personal view of spirituality may include a belief in God or a benevolent force governing the universe. It may be some- thing you associate with angels or spirit guides, or the traditions of indigenous people who have long inhabited this Earth. Your beliefs may have been defined by your parents or the community in which you grew up. Or you may have rejected those beliefs, embracing something far different that resonates more closely with your heart and sensibilities. Regardless of our practices or beliefs, we need to think about how we want to convey them to our children. Do we want them to go to Sunday school? Are there certain rituals we want to incor- porate into their day? Do we want them to learn passages from scripture? Will we pray before meals or bedtime? Do we believe they should be exposed to a variety of religions, so they can make their own choices? Are we atheist or agnostic, determined not to infuse our youngsters with any particular beliefs so they can find their own way? These are very personal decisions, ones I trust parents to sort out for themselves. But we need to be prepared with at least some basic answers once our children begin to ask the big questions about life, including what happens when a loved one passes on. In the movie Cocoon , there is a scene that resonates deeply for me. In it (spoiler alert), a young woman undresses in her cabin and, rather than just removing her clothes (which the fellow peer- ing through a peephole hopes she is about to do), she removes her skin — entirely, from head to toe. Underneath, she is a lumi- nous being of brilliant light. The fellow peeping from next door is rendered dumbstruck. She simply removes her outer identity to become who she really is — a pure being of light.

As I interact with people, I imagine that beneath their outward persona, they — like me — are just man- ifestations of divinity, poured into the tube of a body to play and learn here on earth for a time. Sometimes I even imagine that each person I meet is God or the divine presence in disguise — both of us knowing we aren’t the part we are playing, while (hopefully) having lots of fun playing it out anyway. This idea may be of no use to you, but with some children it can be helpful to explain that our spirit is something akin to light that is poured into the container of our body, and that this is why when someone dies, the love and connection that we feel for them remains. Again, I trust that each parent will find the right way to talk about life and death with his or her own child. For some, that may mean saying nothing at all. Their approach may be to quietly lead a compassionate life, allowing their children to absorb what it is to walk a spiritual path by living it themselves. But some parents may be quite passionate about their spiri- tual practice. They may faithfully attend church, meditate daily, listen regularly to lectures by inspiring spiritual teachers, bow at the altar of their guru every morning, commune with their angels or spirit guides, or go on retreats to deepen their faith. Sometimes the children of these passionate devotees find their parents’ spir- itual pursuits absurd and want no part of them. Like the Michael J. Fox character on Family Ties, who adamantly rejects his parent ’s liberal mind-set and becomes a teenage suit- and-tie-wearing Republican, our kids may reject our spiritual beliefs, even repudiating them with ridicule and disdain.

If the ways that you nourish your soul are real to you, they needn’t be validated by anyone — including your chil- dren. I’ve seen parents sabotage any hope of getting their kids to embrace their spiritual practices by forcing them to participate in them. It doesn’t work that way. Yes, expose your children to the things that nourish your spirit. But let them come to those practices on their own, by watching how you are made calmer or more loving and generous because of them. Once again, our children can be our greatest teachers. They will sniff out and expose any hypocrisy in us. If we are pushy about what we believe or come across as needing them to join us on our path , they will be repelled. If we come out of our rooms after meditating with a snarly attitude, they will lose respect for whatever inner experience of peace we claim to have soaked ourselves in. If we return from church gossiping about the people we saw there . . . you get the picture. Our kids insist on keeping it real. There ’s no need to emerge from your spiritual practice in a saintly fashion, floating into the room with a beatific smile and speaking in hushed tones as you ask your children if they would mind cleaning up their toys. But be aware that kids learn far more from what they see than from what we say. If you want them to embrace your spiritual path — or at least be open to exploring it — don’t shove it down their throats.

But now my fifteen-year-old son says it ’s stupid, and my thirteen-year-old wants to be like his big brother, so he is also refusing to go. What should we do? suggestion: There are two schools of thought on how to answer your question. One would suggest that there are many benefits to establishing a weekly practice of devoting time to prayer, contem- plation, worship, and thanksgiving. This point of view recognizes that children are not inclined to eagerly to get up on Sundays to go anywhere that isn’t “fun” and that parents should be firm in their commitment to involve the family in a regular activity that places focus on nurturing meaningful qualities, even if the kids complain. The other position suggests that forcing children to place their bodies in a house of worship does little to awaken their natural interest in God or spirituality. Taking it further, a forced presence at Sunday services may actually dis incline children from spiritual pursuits because of the negative association they internalize from going through the motions of reverence without having a genuine interest. I believe that if parents demonstrate genuine enthusiasm about devotion to some form of spiritual activity, they should trust that it matters less that their children show up physically than that they feel the ripples of their parent ’s joy, peace, and devotion.

If your fifteen-year-old wants to take a break from attending your church, perhaps it is wise to let him do so; as the saying goes, you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink. You can certainly ask him to join you for what you believe to be a spe- cial and valued family ritual, but you may find he ’s more likely to return if he is allowed to choose rather than because he is forced to attend. If you think your younger son actually enjoys going with you, try talking with him about the importance of thinking for himself and making choices that feel right to him, rather than ones that are motivated by an attempt to win his brother’s approval.

We know it ’s important to practice an attitude of gratitude and that it ’s wise to live in the moment. It ’s the putting-it-into-action part that some of us have trouble with. It is all well and good to know that we should be more present with our kids or live in a state of thank- fulness. It ’s an entirely different thing to incorporate that under- standing into our day-to-day lives. Many of us are committed to making the world a better place, often devoting considerable time and energy to our favorite hu- manitarian causes. But we have a chance right in front of us to positively impact the world. Our parenting path provides us with a practical opportunity to help build a better world by raising chil- dren who grow into conscious, caring adults.

While I encourage you to do them with your youngsters, all these activities can be done on your own as well. Practices for Cultivating Mindfulness, Awareness, and Consciousness “Mom, are you even listening to me?” “Dad, I told you twice already that I needed a ride.” “You said you just had to check your work email for a minute, and that was a long time ago!” As I’ve said several times now, our children can be among our very best teachers, providing us with unlimited opportunities to step into bigger shoes. One of the ways they keep us in check is by pointing out when we have checked out . As mentioned previously, mindfulness practices are breaking loose of meditation centers and making their way into schools, prisons, and hospitals. How wonderful if they could be part of a child ’s life from early on! Imagine a world in which children grew up being present with their feelings, less at the mercy of stressful thoughts, and with a sense of gratitude humming in the background of their daily lives. Here, then, are some ideas for bringing mindfulness practices into your family’s life. It is always best to lead by example, so if you have never done any form of mindfulness or meditation, I suggest doing so for at least a month before introducing it to your children. set the stage The specifics of how you introduce mindfulness and meditation practices will vary based on your child ’s age and developmental stage, but in general, you might say something like this: “You may have noticed that I sometimes like to sit quietly and just be still"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Tools, Tips, and Strategies  for a little while in the morning (afternoon, evening.) When I do that, I feel really nice and peaceful inside, and it helps me through my day. “I’d like to teach you how to do that, too. Would you like that?” (It ’s helpful to get children to “sign up,” rather than decid- ing for them that mindfulness is something they have to do. Most kids will be interested, but it is still a good idea to ask them if they’d like to learn.) “Mindfulness is really simple. It ’s just noticing what is going on in this moment instead of thinking about the past or the future. What I like about it is that it helps me feel calmer and happier. The first thing we ’re going to do is create a special place where we can spend a few minutes practicing it together each day. I thought we could make this area (point out a specific part of your house) that place. Will you help me set it up?” (Invite your children to take part in creating an inviting space, perhaps with cushions, flowers or indoor plants, or little trinkets that have meaning to each of you. If you’re comfortable burning a scented candle or incense, the fragrance makes it easier for some to stay anchored in the present.) Once you have established your mindfulness area, you may begin your first practice. begin the practice “Let ’s get nice and comfortable. Let go of tightness and tension, starting at the top of your head and imagining a warm ball of light relaxing all the muscles in your face and jaw, moving down into your neck and shoulders, allowing each muscle to soften as you let go of any feeling of tightness or tension.” Continue guiding the child into relaxation, from head to toe. One of the easiest ways to introduce mindfulness to children is to use a meditation bell or a Tibetan singing bowl. After strik- ing the gong or making the tone, ask your children to listen very"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence carefully as the sound becomes softer and softer. You can suggest that they raise their hand when they can no longer hear the tone. This will focus their attention on the sound and nothing else Another activity children enjoy is one mentioned in chapter 9 . Instruct your children to listen to whatever sounds are around them — indoors or out. Tell them that if they notice their mind wandering — which it will — they can just gently bring it back to whatever noise captures their attention — the sound of a car going by, their tummy growling, a dog barking. Whatever it is, encourage them just to register the sounds around them in a relaxed, effortless way. follow the breath One of the most common mindfulness practices involves follow- ing the breath. Say to your children, “As you breathe in, pay atten- tion to the breath coming in. Notice the air as it comes into your nostrils. Is it warm or cool? Follow it to the back of your throat, and as it makes its way into your lungs. For the next moment or so, just pay attention to your breath, in your nose, or the back of your throat, or maybe in the rising and falling of your belly as you breathe in and out, or perhaps in the sound made as you inhale and exhale. If your mind wanders — and it probably will — just come back to noticing your breath.” Be quiet for a few breaths so they can continue to do this. You can also have your child count her inhales and exhales to give her mind something to do as she settles in to riding the ebb and flow of her breath. Tell your child, “Relax your body. When you’re ready, take a breath and while inhaling, count ‘one, one, one, one, one, one, one.’ As you breathe out count ‘one, one, one, one ’ until your lungs are empty. Wait for the next breath — don’t rush. Then breathe in, counting two, two, two, and as you exhale, count ‘two, two, two, two’ until you are empty of air. You"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Tools, Tips, and Strategies  may prefer just to count on the inhale or on the exhale; either is fine. Continue this for ten breaths. Notice how it feels to continue breathing without counting for another few moments.” place hands on chest and belly When we exert ourselves or move into a stressful state, we tend to breathe from our chest, and our breaths are more rapid and shallow. When we are relaxed, we breathe more slowly from our belly. A simple but effective way to regain a sense of presence is to invite your child to place one hand on her chest and the other on her belly. “As you breathe in and out, notice which hand is rising and falling. Don’t try to make one or the other hand change what it ’s doing; just pay attention to which hand is moving more.” After your child observes her breathing and hands for a while, you can encourage her to shift her breathing to her belly. After- ward, you may ask if she noticed feeling any different when she was breathing from her belly instead of her chest. If she says she felt calmer, suggest that this is something she could do when she ’s feeling upset, worried, or extra fidgety. After a mindfulness session, many children enjoy sharing what it was like for them — including the difficulties they may have had staying focused as well as any calm feelings they are experiencing. They might also enjoy hearing how it was for you. Listen openly, and let them know how much you enjoyed that spe- cial time together. observe emotions Mindfulness helps children understand what they are feeling so that they are less at the mercy of the storms of big emotions that, left unchecked, can build into a tsunami. Have your children sit quietly or lie down with their eyes closed and tune in to what ’s going on inside them. “Notice how"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence you are feeling: excited, angry, sad, worried, content, curious. You may feel different feelings at the same time — excited and a little worried. Don’t try to change anything — just notice what you’re feeling.” When we help them accept their emotions with- out resistance, our kids become better able to manage their big feelings. In her book of mindfulness exercises for kids, Sitting Still Like a Frog , Eline Snel has children describe their feelings by deliver- ing their Personal Weather Report. Ask them: Are they feeling sunny, stormy, windy, calm, rainy, or in the midst of a hurricane? By tuning into and identifying what they’re experiencing, they can create some distance between themselves and their emotions. As Snel describes it, children can recognize, “I am not the down- pour, but I notice that it is raining; I am not a scaredy-cat, but I realize that sometimes I have this big scared feeling somewhere near my throat.” let thoughts be clouds drifting by This is an interesting activity to do with children, especially those who worry a lot. Invite them to sit comfortably, eyes closed, while tuning in to their breath in one of the ways we have discussed. “As you sit, you may notice or hear thoughts passing through your mind. Without trying to make those thoughts go away — which is impossible anyway — just notice them. Pretend that you’re the blue sky — so big that a few clouds would hardly matter, because there is so much space. Feel yourself being that big and spacious, letting the thoughts that come into your mind be like little clouds, just drifting on by. Don’t try to grab the cloud thoughts, or make them come or go. Just notice them. You might even name them — ‘There ’s a thought about dinner. There ’s a worry about home- work. There ’s a thought about when this is going to be over. And now a thought about what my friend said today.’ Relax and enjoy"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Tools, Tips, and Strategies  the peace and stillness of just being the sky.” After a few moments, invite them to allow their eyes to open, completing the exercise. stroll with presence When children are small, nearly everything they do is mindful. Remember the walks you used to take with your toddler? Getting two or three houses down the street could take forever. Our little ones find everything interesting, from the sound of a bird rustling beneath a bush to those mysterious cracks in the sidewalk. Invite your older kids to step into a greater level of awareness as you go for a walk around the neighborhood. Walk silently, and listen to the sounds around you for a minute or two. Have them notice how the air feels against their body. Is the sun warming their skin? Is there a light breeze? Encourage them to pay atten- tion to the light — how it filters through the trees or flashes off of a nearby car. Or pretend you’ve just landed on Earth from another planet and everything is new. Imagine how you might see a painted fence or how you might marvel at the colors of the flowers as you pass by. rub hands together A very simple way to teach children to get out of their heads and back into the present moment is to have them rub their hands together rapidly for about thirty seconds, feeling the friction and growing warmth. Then have them stop and notice the tingling and heat in their hands. It ’s is a quick and easy way to get back into the body. taste each bite of food Taste is a powerful sense, one that can bring us quickly back to the present. Suggest this to your children: “Imagine you’re from"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence a country — or another planet — where they don’t have this particular food. They have never even seen it before. Take a bite and let the food sit there, rolling around in your mouth before you begin to chew. Notice the flavor of the bite — is it sweet or salty? Notice the density — is it hard or soft? How does it smell? What happens as you chew? Does the texture change as saliva is released? Avoid deciding whether you like the food and don’t try to describe it. Just taste it, staying keenly aware of the tastes and sensations.” Another version of this is to invite your child to eat an apple while paying close attention to each aspect of the experi- ence. “Tune in to your fingers wrapped around the apple. Feel its weight, its smoothness. Take a bite and hear the sound of the crunch as your teeth break the skin. Let the juices fill your mouth, noticing the taste — sweet, tart, tangy, refreshing?” mindfully listen to music Elisha and Stefanie Goldstein, clinical psychologists and cofound- ers of the Center for Mindful Living, are doing wonderful work with their CALM program for teens. Their music meditation is a way for teens to have an in-body experience facilitated by some- thing they love — music! They begin by doing a mindful check-in (having them connect to their breath, body, thoughts, and emo- tions) and then, as they press Play, they prompt the kids to pay attention to their full-body experience as they practice mindful listening to popular music. This activity is always a crowd pleaser! walk in slow motion A lovely mindfulness practice is to walk in slow motion, with all your awareness fixed on the tiny movements that make up each step. Drop your gaze so that you can stay internally focused. Move at a pace slower than normal, noticing how it feels as first your"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Tools, Tips, and Strategies  heel, then the ball of the foot, then your toes make contact with the ground. Pay attention to what the other foot is doing — when it lifts up, when your weight shifts. What muscles are involved in your ankles, calves, knees, and thighs? Which muscles are relaxed or tense as you move? Feel whether your steps are light or heavy. Notice how it feels to shift your balance. You can do this activity for two or three minutes, but it gets interesting when you do mindful walking for twenty minutes or so. When I have done it at retreats, the instruction is generally for participants to avoid talking or making eye contact, staying fully present to the experience of taking each and every step. ask questions to build awareness This activity comes from The Mindful Child by Susan Kaiser Greenland, who suggests asking questions to build more self- awareness. To increase attention, ask, “Are you focused, dis- tracted, or in between?” To ask about wakefulness you would ask, “Do you feel sluggish, energetic, or in between?” and for physical ease you’d ask, “Is it easy to sit still, hard to sit still, or in between?” Susan says you can encourage children to answer with thumbs-up, thumbs-sideways, or thumbs-down hand sig- nals. This is a great exercise for helping children become more aware of what they are experiencing and to communicate it both verbally and nonverbally. focus on just one thing Many kids believe that they can do several things at once: home- work, listening to music, and maintaining a running text message conversation all at the same time. But in fact, multitasking is just rapid task- switching . Studies suggest that the quality of our work diminishes significantly when we split our attention between var- ious activities. When students multitask while doing schoolwork,"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence they understand less, have poorer recall, and find it more difficult to apply what they’ve studied. If you have fallen into the habit of multitasking, try hitting reverse and letting your kids watch you giving your undivided attention to one thing at a time. And if you find your youngster doing several things at once, suggest that he stop, take a few breaths, and collect himself from the scattered places where he ’s split his attention. Invite him to focus on just one thing for a minute or two. “Tune in to your breath or the sensations in your body, to the exclusion of anything else. Now think about whether the paragraph you just wrote for your essay really says what you wanted it to say.” You might also sug- gest that your youngster disengage altogether and take a nature break. Breathing in the great outdoors is a great way to reorient to the present moment. uncurl your ears Children have a lot of fun with this exercise. Place your thumb inside the flap at the top of each of your child ’s ears. With your forefinger on the outside, literally “uncurl” each ear, applying a bit of pressure as you progress down the curve to the earlobe, repeating a few times. It ’s a nice way to wake up the brain. Some- times I suggest that kids do this in the morning when they’re feel- ing groggy or before taking a test in school. • You can practice mindfulness at any time, and in fact, I have included a number of practices that can be done while in motion. But many families find it valuable to do a short practice at the same time each day. For some, a few minutes before heading"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Tools, Tips, and Strategies  off to school creates a great frame of mind for the day ahead. A quick three-minute practice can also reduce the tension of chaotic mornings. Some parents make it a habit to do a practice before bedtime, easing a child into a more relaxed state. Or you may all head to your special place to sit together just before dinner. Don’t force mindfulness on your children, like practicing piano or doing homework. Invite them to participate. If they aren’t interested, let it go. Many parents give advice to their children that they have absolutely no interest in hearing. Sound familiar? When I am coaching a parent who tells me how hard he has tried to convince his child that something is good or bad for her, I ask him, “Did your daughter sign up for your class?” After a moment ’s pause, they laugh. We all know that kids are highly resistant to receiving input or helpful advice that they haven’t asked for. So please be respectful of your children, and don’t force mindfulness practices on them. Chances are, if you make these activities enjoyable, it will be a nonissue. If not, this will be a good time for you to practice nonattachment to outcomes! Practices for Handling Big Emotions give hugs Oh gosh, it is probably obvious that children like hugs, but let me say a few words about them, in case affection was a taboo in your family of origin and you have underestimated its value. Nearly all children are emotionally nourished by being held close. Physical contact with a loving caregiver regulates their still-developing, often-unstable nervous systems, settling them down. But more important, it communicates directly what a child most needs to know: that she is dearly and deeply treasured. In the wordless exchange of a long and loving embrace, everything that needs to be said is said."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence It is true that some children are uncomfortable with close con- tact, but you will know if you have one of those kinds of young- sters. For the most part, I suggest being generous with hugs, and their close cousin, kisses on the top of the head. Some families institute a hugging policy that they call upon when things are rap- idly deteriorating. They stop yelling, drop all negotiations, and open their arms wide. Here is a description of grandparent hugs from Bunmi Ladi- tan’s “Honest Toddler.” Perhaps too sugary, but I found it cute: “Grandparent hugs are mystical. If a grandparent hug were a food, it would be a marshmallow coated in chocolate sauce rolled in cotton candy gently warmed by unicorn breath.” She offers steps, including: “Clear your head of any to-dos. You have nowhere to be.” and “Smile like it ’s Christmas.” Hug your kids. If they won’t let you, hug them with your eyes. They’ll get the message. let the tears fall Parents invest an inordinate amount of effort trying to keep their children from crying. “Don’t be sad.” “Dry those eyes.” “It ’s not that bad!” As with all the miraculous systems of our body, the mechanism of crying is enormously important. Remember dry- eyed syndrome ? This is the term used by psychologists for those children who don’t care what we threaten to do or take away. Their hearts have hardened, and they are emotionally frozen. When we begin taking time to slow down and be quietly pres- ent, painful emotions that have been long repressed may rise to the surface. Many of us remain in constant motion so we won’t feel the pain of unresolved sorrow or grief, when in fact, feeling those feelings is what lets them move through and out. How won- derful to help our children learn that they can allow their emo- tions to be felt, including the difficult ones."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Tools, Tips, and Strategies  In her essay “What Makes You Cry,” Annie Lalla writes, Feelings are internal and can often be hidden, but tears are external and thus seen by others. They are explicit visual cues that indicate: this individual needs help. A bleeding cut on your body says “pay attention, do something to heal the wound.” Similarly, tears say the tribe is bleeding through the tender heart of one member. “Pay attention, go and help.” Tears . . . your tears, are the way your body shows you what ’s important to you. Holding them back is a form of self-deception and a withhold [ sic ] of your deepest truth. . . . Every uncried tear is a lost epiphany, a missed lesson, a moment that failed at aliveness. . . . Tears lead us home. Sometimes the most generous thing we can do for our child — or ourselves — is to sit quietly and let the tears fall. Author Marc Gafni says that our tears show us what we care about. I love that. Encourage your children to let liquid joy and sorrow leak out of their eyes when powerful feelings show up. Honor the big emotions that move your kids, as well as yourself. Let tears lead you home, to your heart. stand on one leg Kim Eng, teacher of Presence through Movement workshops, a spiritual practice that incorporates physical movement as a way of accessing the state of presence, offered this idea for stepping out of anger. The next time you find yourself in a heated argu- ment or power struggle with your child, try standing on one leg while you argue. (The more heated the argument, the higher you lift the leg.) It ’s nearly impossible to continue being angry. You can have your child do the same thing. When you are standing on"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence one leg, which seems like an absurd exercise, you will see that it isn’t the exercise that is absurd, it ’s your ego that is being absurd. The one-legged exercise reminds you that your ego is reacting to a situation and that you can let go. Any unusual posture or move- ment can be used as a way to withdraw attention from the condi- tioned mind, becoming aware of the ego, and generating greater self-awareness. create a peace corner Many children tell me that when they get upset by a sibling’s annoy- ing behavior or a parent ’s nagging, they just want to be left alone for a while. This is actually a healthy expression of self-care. One way to facilitate “alone time” is to establish a corner in your house where kids can go to recover from an emotional storm. (This is the opposite of a time-out chair or being sent to the corner because your child misbehaved.) Furnish it with a beanbag chair and a cozy blanket and call it the Peace Corner or Our Safe Spot. Place things in the space like fidget balls, pipe cleaners, Wikki Stix, a soft stuffed animal, tactile puffer balls, something pleasantly fragrant, magnets, a favorite book or toy, a Tangle stress-relief tube, or puppets. When your child is feeling out of sorts, let him know that this can be a spe- cial place where he can go to unwind and be away from everyone who may have been annoying him. You may end up using it your- self from time to time! establish signals Although many parents believe that children generate melt- downs as a manipulation to get what they want, most children suffer greatly when they tip over the emotional edge and fall apart, almost always remorseful after the fact. Kids just don’t always know how to keep themselves together when they’re over- whelmed by big emotions."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Tools, Tips, and Strategies  In my work, I talk a great deal about the importance of avoid- ing parent-child problems by addressing their cause. But some- times even our best efforts to steer clear of a child ’s emotional storm don’t work. It can be helpful to agree on a signal your child can use to alert you when she is flooded by out-of-control feelings and needs your help. The idea is to help a child think about what she needs to come back to center, taking responsibility for pre- venting future meltdowns without feeling judged by us for losing her cool. “Sweetheart, do you remember how upset you got this morning when you couldn’t find the shoes you wanted to wear? It looked like you were feeling horrible — like a hurricane had started swirling inside you.” Assuming she agrees, you might continue with something along these lines: “I’d like to help you when you’re starting to get so upset. Can you think of what I might have said or done that would have made it easier to stop getting mad? Would you have liked it if I’d given you a hug or walked outside with you for a minute? Or maybe it would have been better if I’d just left you alone for a little bit? What do you think about coming up with a signal you could use that would tell me that you’re starting to lose it? That way, I could do something helpful — like give you a hug — instead of adding to the problem by doing things like talking too much or giving advice?” Some children will come up with a special phrase (“Sweet potatoes!”). Others might invent a hand signal (wiggling all the fingers on one hand, or pulling on an earlobe.) Or the signal could be a sound — “Whoosh!” Realize that this is much easier to talk about when things are going well than it is to enact when a child is headed toward a tantrum. But creating a signal to nip explosive behaviors in the bud can help a child develop greater emotional awareness and mastery."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence Practices for Deep Relaxing put out fires This practice can be beneficial for children who are agitated, angry, or out of sorts, since it helps carry them out of the mael- strom of upsetting thoughts. Have your child either sit or lie down, and say, “Close your eyes, and imagine you’re in a tiny plane flying over every part of your body, looking for tension the way a fire-fighting plane might look for hot spots in a forest fire. It might be that your stomach feels tight, or there ’s a pressure in your chest. Or your hands might feel sweaty or your neck tense. Notice these sensations, and let go as you imagine flooding the area with the “water of relaxation” to put out fires of tightness and tension. As you mentally spray those areas where you are holding stress, pay attention to the wonderful feeling of relaxation that comes, and enjoy that feeling.” have a body part contest As goofy as it sounds, this technique has proved to be a fun way to step out of a busy mind and deepen relaxation. I lie down and close my eyes, and instead of scanning my body for tension, I search for the most relaxed body part. I actually announce to my body that we ’re having a contest and that the most relaxed part wins! Funny enough, as I move from head, neck, back, arms, legs and so on, I notice each part relaxing just a wee bit more so that it might “win.” The sheer silliness of this activity may just appeal to your kids! breathe through a straw To do this exercise, you will each need a drinking straw. Invite your child to take a few normal breaths, and then have her take a breath in and slowly exhale with her lips around the straw with one hand placed about an inch from the end of the straw. The goal"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Tools, Tips, and Strategies  is to exhale so slowly that she cannot feel even a puff of air with the hand on the outer end of the straw. After two or three easy breaths, have her take another breath in, and then put the straw back to her lips and exhale slowly so that again, her hand does not feel any wind. Eventually this exercise can be done without a straw, by simply placing a hand outside the nose or mouth as you exhale, trying again to let the air out so gently that there is no felt puff of air. give your child a calming bracelet Ceremoniously put a little bracelet on your child ’s wrist, calling it “your special calming bracelet.” Then sit together doing one of the quieting activities that has proved successful in helping your child feel peaceful and calm. When you complete the exercise, have him touch the bracelet, suggesting that he pour his peaceful feelings into the bracelet to saturate it with calmness. “When you feel restless or stirred up, touch your bracelet and remember this wonderful feeling of calm.” long swing I learned this exercise while doing vision training but have found that it not only helps my eyes relax by breaking up the stare from being on the computer, but it also helps me restore a feeling of relaxation. It may have something to do with the steady motion, like being rocked in our mother’s bellies. Have your child stand with feet about shoulder width apart and say, “With your eyes open, twist the upper part of your body to the right and then to the left, keeping your feet on the floor but allowing each heel to lift up as you twist to the opposite side. Let your eyes land wherever they will, rather than fixating on any one spot. In fact, don’t try to see anything.

One of my favorites for children — appropriately named — is Child ’s Pose. Start in a kneeling position and drop your bottom to your heels while stretching your body down and forward onto the mat. Lay your arms alongside your body on the floor, your stomach on top of your thighs, and allow your forehead to rest on the mat. This posture relaxes the entire body and is one of many poses helpful in alleviating stress. Practices for the Whole Family share appreciations When I have a family counseling session, I often begin with a round of appreciations. Each member takes turns standing up and telling each person in turn one specific thing they appreciate about them based on the past week. “Daddy, I appreciated that you went bike riding with me. (Older brother) Max, I appreciate that you let me play with you in your room instead of kicking me out. (Lit- tle sister) Cassie, I appreciate that you helped me find my shoes. I forgot I’d taken them off in the backyard, but you remembered. Mommy, I appreciate that you put almonds in my cereal the way I like them.” As each person waits to hear what the speaker is about to say about them, their faces have an expectant, almost beatific glow. I never fail to be touched by these simple expressions, and the way hearts soften. Many families institute this practice reg- ularly. Being appreciated by someone almost instantly changes how we feel about him, even if he is your annoying big brother!"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Tools, Tips, and Strategies  inject more fun The Fun Factor seems to be seriously missing in many children’s lives.

If you have a dancer in the family, he or she can move to the beat. •\t Play hooky with your kids once a year: drive toward school, then drive on by and head out on an unplanned adventure for the day. “Shall we turn right or left?” Make it up as you go. Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “It is a happy talent to know how to play.” Having fun with your children is one of the quickest ways to change the pH of the relationship (chapter 3 ) and restore connection. Enjoy! three pleasures a day This is a fun activity to do with your children. It will help shift the focus from mental activities (often involving something with a plug, screen, or battery) to the pleasures that come from simply inhabiting a human body. It is adapted from Martha Beck’s The Joy Diet. Invite each person in the family to complete the following sentences aloud by listing five things that they enjoy in each cat- egory.

Remembering that you love the smell of lilacs might remind you of how much you enjoy visiting a florist — an easy way to uplift your spirits. Or you may recall how relaxing it is to listen to the sound of the birds, sending you more often to a park bench to drink in their song. mindful drawing Drawing with a child is a great way to settle into the present moment together. Have your youngster choose a simple object and share the instruction to simply draw what you see. Allow the left, language-based, analytical side of your brain to quiet down as you simply draw what is in front of you. Notice details. Walk around the object to see it from different angles. This is a great activity to do with children to awaken awareness to the “what is” in front of us. storytelling In this era of digital overload, many children are losing the ability to form pictures in their mind, contributing to a decrease in their willingness to enjoy the pleasures of a good book. Storytelling entertains, activates the imagination, and calms children down. There are a variety of ways to engage children in the timeless art of telling stories.

Another option is to create “take-turn” stories. Offer an open- ing sentence and then have each of your children add a line or two as you go around in a circle, developing the narrative. Their par- ticipation ensures that they will stay alert and engaged. You may also choose to listen to stories. There are gifted actors who deliver dramatic audio performances for children. One of my favorites is Jim Weiss, from Great Hall Productions. Telling (and listening to) stories is relaxing, builds connec- tion, and develops children’s ability to stay focused. Have fun with it! just listen It goes without saying, but I’ll say it anyway. One of the best ways to connect with your child is to drop what you’re doing and listen to her. Be interested in what she is interested in. Ask questions. Talk about spiders or Elmo or climate change. When we make ourselves fully available to our children to learn more about their interior life with openness and curiosity, we restore connection and strengthen attachment. In chapter 6 , I referred to an exercise I call the Three Yeses that facilitates greater mutual understanding and empathy. Here is an example of this exercise from a session I had with a mother and her son. It begins with Thomas speaking for a few minutes to his mom about something that ’s been bothering him. Mom has agreed to listen carefully without interrupting, rolling her eyes, or defending herself. At the end, she is instructed to get three yeses from Thomas so that he feels heard and validated, and then they switch. thomas: “Mom, it makes me really mad when you are so cranky in the morning. I don’t like it when you come into my room all mad and yelling at me. You’re a lot nicer to Jen. It ’s not fair.

I could just have a breakfast bar in the car. But you still make me get up and sit at the table, and I wish you’d let me stay in bed longer. I’m really tired. That ’s all I wanna say.” mom: “Thanks, Thomas. So, one thing I heard you say is that you don’t see why you have to get up so early. It seems like you can get ready in less than forty-five minutes.” thomas : “Yes.” (I hold up one finger, indicating that mom has gotten one yes.) mom: “I also heard you say that you really don’t like it when I yell in the morning. That really doesn’t feel good.” thomas : “Yep. That ’s right.” (I hold up two fingers.) mom: “And I think I heard you say that you wish you could have your breakfast in the car.” thomas : “No, I just want to eat a bar in the car. Not a whole breakfast.” mom: “Okay. You wish you could have a breakfast bar in the car. So you could stay in bed longer.” thomas : “Yes!” (I hold up three fingers, confirming that mom got her three yeses.) mom: “Okay — got it. Thank you for sharing all that with me.” Now it ’s mom’s turn. She gets to respond — respectfully — to what Thomas has said, and it is now his turn to get three yeses so she also feels heard. mom: “I understand that you’re really tired in the morning, and it ’s super hard to get out of bed.

I wish we could start our mornings off in a friendlier way because I love you and it hurts my heart to fight with you. It hurts both of us.

This helps create a climate in which new possibilities or agree- ments can be forged. Another way of saying this is that each per- son shifts from feeling like the other’s enemy to being on the same team. It is an easy but powerful exercise. weave in a morning good-bye ritual Weaving in a quick mindfulness practice before sending a child off to school only takes a minute and can set him up to have a much better day. Adding an element that fosters connection can also make partings easier for children who have a difficult time with separation. It might be something like taking three deep breaths together while holding hands. It could be a three- second hug, or a little song that the two of you make up. Children love rituals. The more you make anchoring yourselves to feelings of gratitude or connection a part of your child ’s daily routine, the more likely it will become something she continues to do on her own. deliver a smile One of the simplest ways we humans connect with one another is by sharing a smile. It is a universal way of touching another’s heart, building trust, and fostering empathy. On top of that, there are actually health benefits to smiling! It reduces blood pressure, relaxes the body, releases endorphins, and helps diminish stress. A smile delivered lovingly to a child as she races through breakfast or to a wife as she walks in the door can be transformative.

It is a gift to a child to feel so loved. offer a love feast We all want to feel we are appreciated for who we are. When peo- ple visit my website and opt in for my newsletter, they are sent a video with an exercise called Love Flooding. In the video, I invite parents to write down at least ten things they love and appreciate about their child and then set aside time to read their list to their son or daughter. Many parents have told me that this little activity — one that takes just a few minutes — has dramatically improved their relationship with their child. When we let a child know that she is cherished by us for who she is, we are offering her a feast of our love. I highly recommend telling those you love the things about them that delight you. Practices for Manifesting a Happy and Fulfilling Life set intentions Most days, before I walk into my office to start a session with a cli- ent, I set an intention for clarity, presence, and wisdom. Each year I host a Parenting with Presence summit, a series of dialogues held over four days with a variety of notable people such as Dr. Jane Goodall, Arianna Huffington, Jon Kabat-Zinn, Alanis Morissette, and Congressman Tim Ryan. Before beginning, I take a moment with each guest to set an intention that our discussion may unfold in a way that allows us to reach the minds and hearts of parents in every part of the world, uplifting, inspiring, and supporting.

Stepping into a situation with a clear intention can make a huge difference in our experience of it. show gratitude Gratitude is at the cornerstone of everything I have talked about in this book. It changes everything — our relationship to what- ever is going on in our life, our ability to accept the people we interact with, and our capacity to enjoy the moment we ’re in. Appreciation transforms the most challenging experience into one that we can embrace. I could write a book on gratitude — and many have! Here are some ideas that you may want to incorporate into your life. When you feel appreciation for something someone has done, let him know. It ’s easy to forget to acknowledge the kind- nesses we are shown by others, but it is also easy to let them know we noticed and are grateful. A quick “thank you” in person is fine, especially when you pause to actually feel grateful while you are speaking. A text message or email can let someone know you recognized their effort. A quick phone call is lovely. But there ’s nothing like handwriting a note, addressing and stamping it, and sending it off in the mail, knowing the recipient will have the pleasure of reading and rereading your words of gratitude. Letter writing is a lost art — and one I think we should revive. If you’re so inclined, you may even encourage your kids to write notes of thanks — but only if it is done in a relaxed atmosphere. Forcing kids to write thank-you notes can discourage a child from doing them for the rest of their lives! put a dime in the blame jar I wrote earlier about the importance of taking responsibility for our mistakes. While others may provide us with opportunities for"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence justifying our unkind behavior, we need to help children learn that they are responsible for their actions. Blaming keeps us from being accountable and making the changes that would bring us closer to happiness, regardless of whether people or circum- stances conform to our liking. A blame jar can help everyone in the family shift out of victim mode. The idea is simple: if someone points the finger at someone else for making a mistake, she puts a dime in the jar. (Some parents include whining or complaining as behaviors that cost a dime!) This activity can be an important element in raising the awareness that we are the architects of our lives rather than at the mercy of things we cannot control. take a six-minute drive Think about a place that is a short drive from home, and try add- ing this activity as a ritual you institute every time you drive to that place. From the time you leave the house until you arrive at the grocery store, school, or park, declare aloud the things you are grateful for. It ’s that easy. “I’m so glad I have this warm jacket on such a cold morning.” “I am thankful for that yummy smoothie we just had.” “I’m grateful for you guys — you little munchkins!” By the end of the ride, you may be surprised by how great you all feel — and grateful! do a thirty-second appreciation Here is something you can pause and do right now. Look around and let your eyes land on something in your immediate environ- ment. Choose something ordinary, something you’ve seen count- less times before. Perhaps it is the glass of water beside you. Look at it carefully. Pause to appreciate it. Consider the person who designed the glass, how she thought about what it would feel like to hold it, and to drink from it — how she considered the size of"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Tools, Tips, and Strategies  your hand as she determined its dimensions and the way your lip would feel as you placed it to your mouth. Think about the water — the person who helped configure the filtering plant to remove contaminants so that you could safely quench your thirst. Allow yourself to relax into an appreciation for this simple glass of water and all that has gone into manifesting it on the table beside you. You can do this throughout your day, with virtually unlimited objects. Sense the experience of gratitude settling into you. Another thirty-second exercise is to touch your hand to your heart as you review your blessings, reconnecting to your heart and spirit. Let gratitude spread through your chest like a warm glow, opening you up to the miracle of the moment. Making this a daily practice can transform your life. You may even want to set an alarm on your smartphone to remind you to do this every hour or two to solidify an attitude of gratitude! make paper chains of gratitude This is another easy activity you can do with your children. Cut out at least twenty strips of paper and on each strip write down something you’re grateful for. You can then make a paper chain that you hang in the kitchen or living room — or outside your front door — as a reminder of gratitude. So fun! preview the day Before your eyes even open in the morning, preview the day to come and relax into a place of gratitude for each of the people you are likely to encounter — children, spouse, neighbor, boss, coworkers. Generate at least five things about each person that you appreciate. This can definitely make your day go easier and is also a great practice to do with children before they head off to school."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence velcro the good Neuropsychologist Rick Hanson has coined the term Velcro-Teflon syndrome. He says that because Mother Nature is more concerned with our survival than our enjoyment of any particular event, we are wired to remember negative experiences much more intensely than positive ones. The threat of a wild boar makes more impact than a little bird tweeting its song! So negative experiences stick to us like Velcro, lodging them- selves in our consciousness, where we review them again and again . . . and again, often as we ’re trying to fall asleep. (“I can’t believe my boss didn’t thank me for staying late to work on that project. He doesn’t appreciate how hard I work! I put in so much time there.”) Thankfully, we can change the pattern of spiraling into negative thinking. The longer we hold a positive moment in our awareness, the more neurons will fire and wire together, creating a hospitable cli- mate in our brain for happiness. Therefore, if we want our positive experiences to stick (rather than slide off our Teflon coating), we need to remain focused on them for at least twenty seconds. Han- son says, “The more you get your neurons firing about positive facts, the more they’ll be wiring up positive neural structures.” Create a gratitude journal and write about positive experi- ences from your day. Make a drawing of something special that happened that you feel grateful for. Or brag to others — or out loud to yourself — about the good that comes your way. All these activities will take at least twenty seconds, ensuring that your focus makes the neuronal shift toward positivity. notice the positive When you experience something pleasing — the taste of a juicy blueberry, your kids laughing together, the sun warming your skin — allow yourself to soak in good feelings about it.

In other words, a negative thought might drop into our mind, but that doesn’t mean we have to continue down its dark and dreary road. If a negative or limiting belief lands in your head, such as, “I can’t believe how selfish Jonathon is” or “I’ll never be able to figure out how to put this juicer together,” say, “Cancel, Cancel.” The idea is that you immediately nip in the bud the potential for a downward spiral into negativity. Practices for Parents to Do on Their Own toss down the anchor One of the greatest predictors of how my day is going to go is whether or not I’m tethered to my spirit. It ’s analogous to a ship at sea; one that is free floating can drift off course for miles, while a ship that is anchored — even in the midst of rough waters — will remain wherever the anchor was tossed down. Regardless of what tasks or activities await us when we open our eyes to face a new morning, most of us feel pressure to get started. There are children to awaken, breakfasts to pre- pare, lunches to pack, emails to check — the list is endless. Many of us operate from a sense of urgency — the sooner I can get started, the sooner I’ll be done and the pressure will be off. But the truth, of course, is that the minute we check one thing off the list, another pops up in its place. We will never be done, caught up, or complete with everything we have to take care of."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence We shortchange ourselves when we leap into the day without making contact with the touchstone within, even for a moment or two. And here is what I have discovered: That beautiful feel- ing inside is the secret sauce that makes everything better. When I focus on my spirit, I feel so much better, and so much more myself; I shake my head in wonder that I skip days or don’t spend more time doing something that brings me so much joy and peace. But I forget. It seems that life is orchestrated in such a way as to require me to choose that inner experience, to consciously turn away from the seduction of the outer world to swim in the waters of the inner one. It ’s not easy. I am drawn to what ’s going on outside myself. Potential distractions are everywhere: The news- paper. The television. Emails. The garden that needs watering. The phone calls that need to be returned. And this is life without children underfoot! For parents of little ones, carving out a few minutes to drink from the peaceful well within is a challenge, I know. And I have also found, over the forty plus years I have med- itated, that the feeling inside wants to be courted. It ’s like a ten- tative but extraordinary lover. When I set a clear intention that if only for a few moments, I am going to give all of myself to that inner experience and I keep turning toward that feeling when my mind wanders, I am rewarded with an experience that defies description. It is holy and divine, sweet and tender. I become who I am, and my heart does a little song and dance with happiness that I have taken the time to feed it what it most wants and loves and needs. From this place, I can move through my day with that feeling still humming in the background, at least some of the day, or at least until the noise of the outside world gets terribly loud. But even then, the deepest part of me remembers what is more real inside me, and I don’t lose myself quite so badly in the rush and tumble."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Tools, Tips, and Strategies  Meditation is a practice. It ’s not a pill we can pop. It takes time to get to know ourselves as who we truly are. It is an invest- ment. Not everyone wants to go deeply within, and that is fine. We should each follow the call of our hearts. But following the call of our hearts requires us to get quiet and listen. As you tune in to what brings you a sense of peace or joy, pay attention. Court that feeling. Bring it flowers. Send it love letters. That feeling beneath your identity as a wife, husband, partner, mother, father is who you really are. Just like your child, it wants to be seen and loved. It wants your time and attention. Investing in that you — beyond the external identity or role you play — will pay off in spades. Make time for it. Throw down the anchor to connect with your inner self for a moment before going about the business of your day. I think you’ll be glad you did. do nothing Choose a fifteen-minute time slot and find a place where you can be alone. (I know this is easier said than done, but stay with me here.) It might be a walking trail, your back porch, or even your car. Try to ensure that for those fifteen minutes you will not be interrupted. Martha Beck describes this as putting up the No Vacancy sign in your life. She goes on to say that the next step is either to sit in medita- tion or to do a mindless, repetitive activity that keeps your body busy such as walking, Rollerblading, or jogging. Watch grass blowing in a field, or witness the ripples moving across a pond. Next she invites you to vacate your mind. “The typical human mind is like a supercomputer possessed by the soul of a demented squirrel. It ’s constantly calculating, anticipating, remembering, fantasizing, worrying, hoarding, bouncing frenetically from thought to thought to thought.” At this stage, you simply watch your thoughts without judging them. You might picture the"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence thoughts in your head as small, yapping dogs. You are the big elephant lumbering down the road as the harmless little dogs yip and yap. The last step is to create a mental image of a sanctuary where you can anchor yourself in times of stress or chaos. Call to mind a special place where you feel peaceful and still, a place where the world stops and you come to a feeling of deep rest and content- ment. You can visit this place in your imagination during your fifteen minutes of Doing Nothing. This practice is wonderful for helping restore a sense of peace and balance in your life. make contact Here is an activity I sometimes do when I am in an airport, although I’ve done it other times as well. I walk through the ter- minal specifically watching for anyone who is available for con- tact — a glance, a friendly smile, a nod. When I play this game, I usually notice that it is difficult to find someone who isn’t hur- rying and scurrying around, looking at his watch or fussing at his children to stay close. But now and then I hit the jackpot and get a lovely reminder from another pair of eyes that no matter where we ’re going, we are each just here and now, and all is well. appreciate yourself This exercise can be one of the hardest; when I do it with my cli- ents it is sometimes like pulling teeth to get them started. But it is very powerful. Think about the qualities in yourself that you appreciate: kindness, generosity, patience, a sense of humor. Include anything you like about yourself. If you are having a hard time, ask your friends to tell you five things they appreciate about you. (If that is also difficult, tell them it ’s a required assignment for a class you’re taking!)

Make sure you know what a gift you are to us all. tune in when you are triggered Sometimes we get triggered because our child ’s behavior is in direct conflict with our beliefs. If you grew up in a household where it was expected that children should instantly do what they’re asked, or should never talk back to their parents, then you are likely to feel a real reaction coming on when your kids refuse to pitch in, or they sass back. We may also get triggered when our child behaves in a way that is foreign to our innate temperament. A loud child is more likely to push the buttons of his mild-mannered mother. Or we might lose a grip on our composure because we believe we aren’t living up to the expectations of people whose opinion means a great deal to us — our spouse, friends, mother-in-law, or favorite parenting “expert.” When you realize that you are out of alignment with your own inner parenting wisdom, try the following exercise. step 1. Become quiet and still. Tune in to what is taking place — your little boy demanding pasta and butter or your daughter refusing to turn off the TV. Simply become aware of how you are feeling inside. step 2. If an onslaught of thoughts starts fueling your upset, ask, “Whose voice am I hearing in my head right now?” My mother or father’s?

Or it may be suggesting that you’re perilously out of control. step 4. Look for the need underneath that voice. Perhaps it is saying: I am afraid that you don’t know how to handle your son. I’m worried that if I don’t scare you or criticize your parenting, you will stop trying to rein in his aggressive tendencies. step 5. Jot down what you learn from this insight. Say to that voice within yourself: I get the message, I appreciate it, and here’s what I’m going to do about it. This activity may be done in conjunction with therapy or a parenting class in which you are in a committed process to learn more about what derails your efforts to stay calmly and lovingly in charge. It isn’t easy, but it is always illuminating. dance your way out of anger One of the quickest ways to get anger out of your body is to dance. Put on one of your favorite toe-tappers, and get moving! By the end of a song or two, you may even have forgotten what got you so hot and bothered! I often start off my day with some- thing lively or take dance breaks after focused writing to get back into my body and the juicy thrill of being alive. name what you miss Being present means making contact with life as it is, right now. It means choosing to be here, even if “here” isn’t quite what you’d pictured. It means being present with the sound of your children laughing — or arguing — in the next room. It means being pres- ent as you sit on the piano bench helping your son practice as he stumbles through the notes. But sometimes, before we can fully be present to what is in"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Tools, Tips, and Strategies  front of us, we have to grieve for what we have lost, or at least what we think we ’ve lost. Take a few moments to get quiet. Place your hand on your heart as you breathe, and step into a place of real kindness toward yourself. Acknowledge the effort you make each day from the moment you awaken until you collapse into bed at night. Soften your heart to the ways you have had to stretch beyond yourself and the things you have had to let go of. Ask this question, and wait for an answer without forcing one to come: “What am I missing from the life I was living before I had children?” Be still and wait quietly. If no answer comes to mind, that ’s fine. If you sense or hear an answer that doesn’t immedi- ately make sense, let it lead you where it will. It is important to stay in a loving and kind place toward all of yourself, allowing anything to be true, even if it isn’t the truest truth or the whole truth. Perhaps you miss preparenting dinners when you could sit down from start to finish without popping up to get something for someone. You may miss leisurely time to be romantic with your partner. You might miss long baths, or walks alone in the woods, or simply a mind that isn’t constantly keep- ing track of where your children are, how they’re doing, or what they should be doing. You might miss uninterrupted time to write, read, or meditate. Or you might just miss who you were before you became so inextricably entwined with others — perhaps you were more lighthearted and relaxed or more focused and seem- ingly productive. Reflect on this question. You may want to talk aloud or jour- nal about what comes up. Again, if nothing shows up, that ’s fine. Don’t force yourself to miss something you don’t miss. But give yourself space for flushing out the hidden things that may impair your ability to show up completely for your life."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence ask yourself some difficult questions Many times we have trouble being attuned with and present to our child because, as discussed in chapter 3 , our vision of raising children doesn’t quite match up to reality. It may even be radi- cally different from what we expected, leaving us disappointed, discouraged, or even regretful. None of this means we don’t love our children or that we wish we didn’t have them. It just means that we have feelings we need to face rather than sweeping them under the rug. It is our expec- tations that get us into trouble. If you were sure that having a baby would solidify a marriage that was on the rocks, you may have discovered that parenting adds to marital stress rather than eliminating it. If you imagined that having a baby would win you the approval of your parents, you may find that it also exposes you to their ongoing criticism about how you’re parenting. And if you believed that having a baby would fill an emptiness in your heart and soul, you have probably found out that it does not, and cannot, without enormous cost to your child. That said, children do add to our lives immeasurably. They sometimes even strengthen marriages, create stronger bonds with extended family, and fill our hearts with a love we could not have imagined. The problem is that children don’t always do those things for us. And most important, it is not their job to improve our marriages and family relations or vanquish our loneliness. Just like that line in Jerry Maguire that precipitated ridicule — “You complete me” — it is not our children’s job to complete us. When we raise our kids with that kind of neediness, we disturb the natural hierarchy of dependency. Our kids are meant to lean on us — not be the answer to our unresolved needs. Below are a few questions you may find useful as you reflect on the expectations you brought to your parenting life. I urge you to be honest but also very gentle with yourself. We all have"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Tools, Tips, and Strategies  expectations about raising children. We all hope that adding kids will make our lives better. We all have wounds from our child- hoods that we hope to heal as we grow older.

If some very painful realizations come up, please seek the support of a trusted professional to help move through those old feelings. I once heard an interview with a mother who was stalking her twenty-seven-year-old daughter — showing up at her work, hanging around her favorite coffee shop, and calling her through- out the day to “check in.” Her daughter was mortified and desper- ate to have some space. When the mother was challenged by the interviewer, she declared with great emotion, “I love my daughter! I have been a mother my whole life! It ’s what I do! It ’s who I am!” The psy- chologist urged her to pursue interests she had before she ’d had children. She replied, “I don’t have any other interests. I’ve never done anything else. I am a mother.” She had so identified with the role of parent that she had lost a sense of herself as a separate per- son. And in the process, she was clipping her daughter’s wings. Here are some questions to reflect on: What did you hope parenting would do for you? What changes did you imagine it would bring about in your life? Was there an empty feeling that you hoped would be filled by having a child? How has real-life parenting failed to match up to your expec- tations? Are there times that you wish you could freeze-frame? Do you miss earlier stages of your child ’s life in ways that make it difficult to accept who they are now? Again, take your time, and go easy with this exercise. It ’s all okay."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence unravel your fear of being judged Many parents feel especially triggered by their child ’s misbehav- ior when they are out in public or with extended family. They may suffer from what psychologist Mary Pipher calls imaginary audience syndrome , a term she coined to describe adolescent girls’ heightened self-consciousness. But parents can also suffer from this affliction, believing that other people are scrutinizing their every move, judging them ruthlessly every time they fail to sub- due a child ’s tantrums, or their child forgets her manners. When we are suffering from imaginary audience syndrome we are terrified of losing status with those we think we need to impress, moving into Lawyer or Dictator mode to try to control our child ’s behavior so we can look good to those around us. The following questions can help you get to the root of these feelings of shame or heightened self-consciousness. 1 . Whose judgment do you most fear? 2 . What concerns you about having this person thinking poorly about your parenting? 3 . What would having this person’s approval give you? 4 . What else would you gain from this person’s approval? 5 . And what else? 6 . Is there any way you could get the things you wrote in answer to 3 to 5 without securing that person’s approval? This exercise can uncover some difficult truths but can also be invaluable in liberating us to live with greater authenticity, imper- fections and all. see your child without a name Sometimes we trip over personality and ego, losing sight of who we and our children are beneath names, labels, and long-held per- ceptions.

Forget that you are her mother or father. Simply step back and regard your child as a spirit poured into the container that is her body, here to journey alongside you in this most inti- mate way. You may find it easier to do this exercise when your child is sleeping, but it can be lovely to spend a few minutes in the wakeful company of your child, trying to see him or her as a beloved brother or sister of your soul. Just don’t forget that, in this lifetime, at this time, you are playing the role of parent; while you and your children are equals on a soul level, down here on Earth, you’re still the grown-up in charge. say, “there, there” Parents are often masters at offering comfort to their children. We fuss over boo-boos, cluck over owies, and pour mommy or daddy love into broken hearts. How sad then, that we are sometimes so cruel to ourselves when we are hurting. “I should have known better!” “I shouldn’t let that bother me!” I have repeatedly said that parenting is hard. It is. It ’s impos- sible, really. And therefore it is impossible not to have really tough days. That is one of the reasons I love the following practice and urge you to make it your own. When you are feeling overwhelmed, or you’ve come apart at the seams, touch your heart in the same loving way you would your hurting little boy or girl, and say, “There, there.” I want you to say it out loud. Parents are no less deserving of loving-kindness and comfort than their children, and yet we are exceptionally stingy about acknowledging how tough it sometimes is to keep it all together.

With that in mind, I’d like to invite you to think about what you have read in this book that made particular sense to you. What grabbed your attention or prompted you to think about your own parenting life? You may find it useful to do a quick scan through the book to see what jumps out or reminds you of something you’d like to incorporate into your life. Pick two things you would like to work on in the next three months. Perhaps you want to commit to acknowledging nonjudg- mentally whatever you are feeling when you find yourself getting upset. You may decide you want to be kinder to yourself — more ruthless about challenging the negative things you say to your- self. Maybe you want to slow down and be more present with your kids. Or you may decide you’d like to commit to apologizing more readily, taking ownership for mistakes. Set realistic goals for making the changes you have chosen. If you decide to change the tone of voice you use with your kids and how much time you spend with them and how often you’re on your digital devices and how present you stay with your feelings when you get upset, and how calmly you handle stress . . . well, you get the picture. It ’s no good trying to change everything at once. At any rate, I have no doubt that much of how you are parenting is already terrific! I just want you to focus on two things that would make a substantive difference in your daily life. Or even one! In your journal, please describe two changes that you would like to work on in the next three months. Below each intention, write a sentence or two about why you want to institute this shift."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Tools, Tips, and Strategies  How will your life improve as a result? Here ’s what it will look like (This exercise can also be found on my website, www.Susan Stiffelman.com/PWPextras): Two changes I’d like to make in the next three months: 1 . Why I want to work on this (How will my life be better?): 2 . Evidence of change (How will I know that these changes are underway?): You will lose your way. Just as you are instructed to gently bring your focus back to your breath if your mind wanders during mindfulness practices, be kind to yourself if you drift from your intended new behavior. You may find yourself nagging when you promised you wouldn’t or getting lost online when you commit- ted to hitting the Off switch after a certain amount of time. Be patient. Be kind to yourself. At the end of each day, jot down any progress you made toward making these two changes, even if you have to get out your magnifying glass to find something! Change happens baby step by baby step. There will be days when you seem to move backward, slipping and stumbling along. That ’s to be expected. Just commit to making an effort, and write or record at least two or three bits of evidence that suggest you’re moving forward with your intentions. A story is told about a shepherd boy who wanted to be strong enough to lift a sheep but found it impossible, lamenting to his father that he was too weak. His father picked out a newborn lamb and gave his son the instruction to carry the lamb around its enclosure every day, without fail. The boy thought his father’s directions were useless. After all, the baby lamb was so light and so tiny; he wanted to be able to carry a full-grown sheep! But he obliged his father, carrying the baby lamb around its enclosure each day, not noticing that every day, the lamb was growing big- ger — and the boy’s muscles were growing stronger. Finally, as"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":" Parenting with Presence months went by, the boy realized that he had become capable of carrying what was now a full-grown sheep. If you commit to living with greater awareness, acknowledg- ing any and all small successes each day, then change in your fam- ily will be inevitable. You will be able to carry the sheep. Just start — today — by lifting the little lamb. wear a rubber band This exercise is an easy way to make practical and lasting changes. I have used it not only with adults but also with children, with great success. Choose one thing you would like to stop doing. It could be yelling at your kids. It might be blaming others. Place a rubber band on your wrist as you announce your desire to stop doing that thing. I sometimes have each member of a family pick a behavior they would like to work on and then invite them to all ceremoni- ously put their rubber band on while declaring their intention. “I hereby place this rubber bands on my wrist with the intention of using a nicer tone of voice with everybody!” “I hereby place this rubber band on my wrist with the intention of not teasing my little sister!” If you slip up and do the behavior you’re trying to stop, move the rubber band to the other wrist. The goal? Keep the rubber band on the same wrist for twenty-one consecutive days. The idea is that it takes about twenty-one days to change a habit. So if you have a physical reminder with you wherever you go, it becomes easier to stay aware of your intention to change a behavior."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":" Epilogue • • I n India a story is told of a man who leaves his village to make his fortune. Some years later, as he journeys back home with his riches, a thief claiming to be a fellow traveler joins him. As they travel together each day, the wealthy man talks about the money he made and all the things he is going to do now that he is rich. Every night the two of them share lodging. When the wealthy man steps out for his evening meal, his companion searches the room from top to bottom for the money the man claims he is bringing back to his village. On their fi nal day, as the man nears his village, the thief con- fesses. “I must tell you that I am a thief. It was my plan to steal your riches, but each night when you left the room, I searched high and low and never found anything. Tell me, now that you are safely delivered to your village — did you really have all that money?

That is why I hid my money where you would never find it.” “Where? Where did you hide it?” The man replied simply, “Under your pillow.” We gain true freedom when we realize that everything we could ever want or need for is already ours. But we forget. In Conversations with God , Neale Donald Walsch invites us to imagine that God delivers us into human life with amnesia. We forget who we are so that we might experience the great joy of finding our way back home again. To do that, we need to get very still and quiet. We need to be able to listen to the voice within, calling us Home. Most of us hustle and rush through our days, forgetting that there even is an inner voice whispering an invitation to rest within and enjoy the moment, whatever it may be. Children remind us. They remind us of our natural state — the one buried beneath layers of fear, guardedness, or disengagement from life. They remind us of who we can be if we live with an open heart, in won- der, enchantment, and gratitude. They remind us of the treasures hidden under our own pillow. Everything we are looking for is here. It is here in our active days, our sleepless nights, the snuggles under Dora the Explorer sheets, and the shouting from the sidelines at baseball games. It is here, the possibility of true expansion of our heart and soul. If we embrace the moment, we will find everything we long for. There is a glass ceiling that is blessedly being shattered as a generation of parents commit to parenting with greater pres- ence, attunement, and engagement. Doing so is not easy; in fact, for most of us, it is counterintuitive to how we were raised, very much a journey of two steps forward, one step back. But if you make even a small effort to be more awake and engaged with your children, the possibilities are limitless! Not only will you"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"Epilogue  experience greater joy in your heart and peace in your home, but the world will be populated with more and more people who grew up feeling seen, appreciated, and enjoyed.

Long-held limiting beliefs were laid to rest as new possibilities were being birthed, starting with the invitation by Eckhart Tolle and Kim Eng to publish Parenting with Presence with New World Library’s new imprint, Eckhart Tolle Editions. Not only was I being offered an opportunity to associate with one of the clearest and brightest lights I have ever met, but Eckhart went so far as to help edit the book as I wrote. I cannot adequately express my thanks to both Eckhart and Kim for so deeply believ- ing in my work and championing it so that others may benefi t from what I have learned along the way. To my supercalifragilistic editor, Jason Gardner, thank you, thank you, thank you.
