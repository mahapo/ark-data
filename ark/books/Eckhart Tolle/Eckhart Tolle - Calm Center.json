How spiritual you are depends on yourdegree of presence in everyday life, which is to say your state ofconsciousness.The essence of all spirituality is presence, a state of consciousness thattranscends thinking. There is a space behind and in between your thoughts andemotions. When you become aware of that space, you are present, and you realizethat your personal history, which consists of thought, is not your true identityand is not the essence of who you are. What is that space, that innerspaciousness? It is stillness, the calm center. It is pure consciousness, thetranscendent I AM that becomes aware of itself. The Buddha called it sunyata,emptiness. It is the “kingdom of heaven” that Jesus pointed to, which is withinyou, here and now.As presence increasingly arises within you, it manifests in many different ways:inner peace, empathy, an outflow of goodwill toward your fellow human beings,creativity, a heightened sense of aliveness, freedom from dysfunctional andcompulsive thinking, a deep appreciation of the present moment. All these shiftsand many other changes greatly enhance the quality of your life.Presence can also empower and inspire the spoken and written word. All truespiritual teachings use words as pointers toward that transcendent dimension ofconsciousness that is presence. In some mysterious way, the words that arise outof presence are imbued with a certain power that goes beyond their informationalvalue and is reflective of presence. That power can awaken or deepen thepresence in those people who listen to or read those words. All true spiritualbooks have that power. You can, and indeed will want to, return to and rereadthem many times, because a certain shift in consciousness happens within you asyou read. You enter the state of presence.The Calm Center is one of those rare books. It belongs to the genre of poetry,which has been recognized since ancient times as a highly appropriate medium forthe expression and transmission of spiritual truth. Many ancient scriptures canbe considered either as poetry or as existing on the borderline between poetryand prose. The Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Dhammapada, and the Tao TeChing are all poetic in nature. In these texts, meaning, images, sound, andrhythm interact to create a harmonious whole whose transformative power isactivated in the consciousness of the reader or listener. Then there are thegreat mystical poets of Sufism, such as Hafiz, Rumi, Kabir, and Attar; and theBuddhist poets Basho and Milarepa. In the Christian tradition also there aregreat mystical poets, such as St. John of the Cross, Angelus Silesius, and ofcourse Meister Eckhart, whose writings, with their masterful use of images andmetaphors, could be described as poetic prose. In more recent times, thespiritual dimension is present in the works of numerous poets, such asWordsworth, Whitman, Rilke, and many others.Steve Taylor’s The Calm Center is a contemporary incarnation of that ancienttradition of poetic spiritual discourse. The ultimate subject matter of almosteach one of these poems is the reader’s state of consciousness. If you openyourself to their transformative power, and read slowly and attentively, thenyou will find that each piece will work its magic within you and bring about asubtle but distinct shift in your state of consciousness. It will free you fromthe mental noise of compulsive thinking and raise you into the alert innerstillness that is presence. It will awaken you to the spiritual dimension. Andif you enjoy reading these poems repeatedly, their cumulative effect will bepotentially life-changing.I recommend that you keep a copy of the book on your bedside table and anotherat your place of work to provide spiritual sustenance during your breaks,however short. The reading of each piece can become a mini-meditation, and oftenone will be all you need at any given time. I have read some of Steve Taylor’spoems out loud to the participants at spiritual retreats, where they wereenthusiastically received. I would advise that you also occasionally share yourfavorite pieces aloud with your partner, spouse, family members, or group offriends. You, as well as those who listen, will benefit greatly from this, aswill the quality of your relationship. Just make sure, however, that the otherperson is open and receptive, so that you don’t cast these pearls before peoplewho are too unconscious to appreciate them.Allow me to start off your spiritual reading pleasure with this little excerptfrom a poem:I wish I could show you, When you are lonely or in darkness,The Astonishing LightOf your own Being!* [part0008.html#fn-1]This little gem certainly does not look out of place in the pages of this book.It was written, however, over six hundred years ago by the great Persian Sufipoet Hafiz, who was given the epithet “Tongue of the Invisible” — which goes toshow that words that emanate from presence are timeless.— Eckhart Tolle, author of The Power of Now and A New Earth__________* [part0008.html#fn1] Hafiz, “My Brilliant Image,” I Heard God Laughing: Poemsof Hope and Joy, trans.

present?When maelstroms of tormenting thoughtspush back the barricades of your sanitythe present is the calm center where you can rest.And slowly, as you rest there,the niggling thoughts and fears dissolvelike shadows shrinking under the midday sununtil you don’t need refuge anymore.The present is the only placewhere there is no thought-created pain.The present is the only place."},{"pageContent":"The Challenge [part0007.html#rch2]How will you know how strong you areunless your strength is tested?How will you know how deep you areunless turmoil breaks your surfaceand

rise like a sun, amazed by your own brightness,stronger than you ever suspecteddeeper than you ever dreamed."},{"pageContent":"Divine Dissatisfaction (The Opening) [part0007.html#rch3]When you sense there’s something morewhen the life that used to satisfy you no longer seems enoughand security seems suffocating and pleasures lose their tastewhen dreams of success don’t motivate you anymoreand diversions don’t seem to divert youwhen familiarity seems oppressive, like a coat that’s too old and tight,and every repetition of the old routinemakes you feel more stale and wearyWhen you find yourself achingwith a sadness that doesn’t seem to have a sourcewith a hunger that seems too subtle to satisfywhen strange energies are pulsing through youlike the tremors of an earthquake deep down insideand you can feel the ground shiftingand are afraid of losing balanceand you ask yourself, “What’s wrong with me?Why can’t I be happy anymore?”Have no fear — there’s nothing wrong with you.This isn’t anxiety or depression,it’s divine dissatisfaction.You’re not breaking down but breaking through.This is your awakeningthe tearing of the veilthe opening of your soul.Your real self is emerging, slowly, painfully,through the hard skin of your chrysalis.The old world is receding behind youand you’re waiting at the threshold of the new, disoriented,wondering how to make sense of this strange place.But as long as you have the courage to move forwarda guide will appear and your path will form before youand a glorious adventure will begin.And soon the lushness of this landscape won’t startle you anymoresoon the brilliance of this sun won’t dazzle yousoon the vastness of this space won’t feel overwhelmingand the magic and meaning of this new world will embrace you."},{"pageContent":"Become

beat its wingsbut now just lets them hang limply by its sides.But the bars of your cage aren’t solid.They’re a mirage made up of fears and desiresprojected by your restless mindfueled by the attention you give them.Just for a moment let your mind be quietand see how fears evaporatesee how desires withdrawlike the claws of an animal that’s no longer threatened.Watch the bars melt awayand let the world immerse you.Let your mind-space merge with the space out thereuntil there is only space without distinction —stretch your wings and become the sky."},{"pageContent":"The Voice inside Your Head [part0007.html#rch5]One day you’ll grow fed up with the voice inside your headwith its constant murmurings of discontentits fearmongering thoughts of the futureand its questioning of every choice you make.One day you’ll turn to it and calmly say, “I refuse to listen”then stand back and look awayturning your attention to your surroundingsor to a quietness and spaciousness you can senseinside you, just behind the voice.The voice is so self-absorbedthat at first it won’t even notice it’s being ignoredand will carry on chattering away to itself.You’ll still hear its complaints and criticismsbut they won’t convince you anymore —you’ll doubt them, laugh at them, reject them.And gradually, without the fuel of your attention,the voice will become more hesitantwill stumble and slow down, leaving space;until eventually that self-assertive drawl that demanded to be heardand seemed to submerge the rest of realitywill be no louder than a whisper, like a gentle breezethat seems to be part of silence."},{"pageContent":"The Core [part0007.html#rch6]It can take a whole lifetime to become yourself —years of feeling adrift and aloneacting in a role you were never meant to playstammering in a

accident.Death creeps behind you and swipes you hard across your backawakening you from your torpor.Suddenly the fog dissolvesand you can see the narrow ledge you’re walking— the one you’ve always been walking — between life and death.And now it’s all so simple and makes perfect sense —life is temporary and fragile, precious beyond measure,and life contains nothing except this present

life easier —there’s a storm of impressions, thoughts, and feelingsthat could confuse and overwhelm youbut you can stand firm, with the mask protecting you,reflecting back the world like a cold metallic shielddeflecting any pain that comes your way.And it’s easier still when you don’t stand back and watch anymorewhen you become the role you’re playingand forget you were ever anyone else.But the mask is like a child that never grows upthat will never be self-sufficient;you have to keep feeding it with attentionand make sure it never meets silence or solitude —the two predators that threaten it.And eventually the mask will crumblewhen you can’t keep up the effort anymoreand collapse like an exhausted parent at the end of the day.Then your real self will stumble freestunned after

they might be thinkingand be discouraged if no one seems to be watching at allor frustrated if they don’t seem to understand.It’s enough to do what you’re meant to doto express what you’re meant to expresswithout evaluating your effector considering results or reactions.There’s too much at stake for you to becomeanything less than you were meant to be,to leave the smallest part of your potential unfulfilledor the smallest piece of your message unsaid.This is the time to be fearlessso that the force can flow through you freely.This is the time to be emptyso that the source can fill you completely.This is the time to step asideand let the project unfold through you."},{"pageContent":"Back Home [part0007.html#rch54]Back hometo the place where the sky is as wide as spacewhere the clouds caress one another as they floatwhere the trees are dancing messengers of the windwhere shapes are clear and fine and colors seem to shineas if they’re cut from the clearest glass.Back hometo the soothing serene energy of the selfthe underground river that makes the soil so richwith roots stretching way, way downinto the safe and sturdy groundso that stress and fear can’t bend or break you.Back hometo the place where time opens up, almost seems to stop,and there’s no more striving or seeking or even doingonly a graceful glide of being through every easy dayand the pressure of the future fades awaylike an army retreatingleaving the present in peace."},{"pageContent":"The Essence [part0007.html#rch55]The essence of you is emptinessthe essence of you is lovethe essence of you is energythe essence of you is bliss.The essence of you flows like a fountainfrom a pool of pure consciousness at the heart of reality.The essence of you surges with an eternal forcethat has borrowed you for this lifetime.The essence of you is deathless.This form will wither and dissolve awaythen the essence will return to its sourceto find a new expression.The essence of you stretchesinside and outside your bodyinside and outside timewithin and beyond the worldat home, in peace, in every place."},{"pageContent":"Acknowledgments [part0007.html#rack]I would like to express my gratitude to
