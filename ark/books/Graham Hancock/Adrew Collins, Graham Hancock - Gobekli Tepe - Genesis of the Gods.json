Yet those of a NewAge persuasion who had waited patiently for this all-important date were to besadly disappointed. Even so, an archaeological discovery brought to the world’sattention for the first time in 20001 [index_split_058.html#filepos919845] isnow poised to make up for any sense of anticlimax that might have accompaniedthe millennial nonevent.I speak of Göbekli Tepe, a megalithic complex of incredible beauty andimportance located close to the ancient city of Şanlıurfa in southeast Turkey.Here, quietly, since 1995, a series of stone enclosures of immensesophistication, each containing T-shaped pillars up to 18 feet (5.5 meters) talland weighing as much as 16.5 US tons (15 metric tonnes), is being uncovered on amountain platform close to the western termination of the Anti-Taurus range.Carved into the faces of the dozens of stone pillars and freestanding monolithsuncovered so far is a virtual menagerie of strange creatures that populated theworld when these mysterious monuments were constructed between twelve thousandand ten thousand years ago. Foxes, wolves, lions, snakes, aurochs, hyena, ibex,and boars are seen alongside insects, arachnids, and various species of bird,including crane, vulture, flamingo, and a flightless bird with the likeness of adodo.The quality and style of Göbekli Tepe’s strange carved art are at oncebreathtaking and mesmeric, a fact made even more incredible in the knowledgethat we are told the complex was built by simple hunter-gatherer communitiesthat thrived in an age before the emergence of subsistence agriculture andanimal husbandry.NEOLITHIC REVOLUTIONProfessor Klaus Schmidt, the forward-thinking German archaeologist in charge ofexcavations at Göbekli Tepe, now believes that the Neolithic revolution cameabout as a result of the creation of megalithic complexes of this kind acrosssoutheast Turkey, which forms part of what archaeologists refer to as thetriangle d’or, or golden triangle. Schmidt proposes that the many hundreds ofpeople involved in the construction and maintenance of the enclosures at GöbekliTepe would quickly have depleted locally available food resources.Add to this the thousands of “pilgrims” who would descend on the site for clangatherings and other forms of ceremonial activity, and it is clear that another,more plentiful supply of food was required—one that could be provided year inyear out, ad infinitum. Hence, subsistence agriculture rapidly emerged in theform of the domestication of wild species of wheat and rye. This required thehunter-gatherers of the region to become settled farmers and pastoralists livingin more permanent environments, which gradually emerged as the first towns andvillages of the Neolithic age.Evidence of this transition from hunter-gatherer to settled farmer in southeastTurkey comes from the discovery by geneticists that sixty-eight modern strainsof wheat derive from a form of wild wheat called einkorn that thrives to thisday on the slopes of an extinct volcano named Karaca Dağ, which lies some 50miles (80 kilometers) to the northeast of Göbekli Tepe.All this was occurring in the Near East as much as two thousand years before theflowering of the first major city complexes at places such as Çatal Höyük andAşıklı Höyük in what is today central Turkey. They emerged as part of the rapidexpansion of the Neolithic revolution, which after embracing the CentralAnatolian Plain very quickly reached Eastern Europe. The revolution movedsouthward also into the Levant, where forms of protoagriculture already existed,and eastward into Iran, Central Asia, and eventually India and Pakistan, home ofthe Indus Valley civilization. Schmidt is in no doubt that Göbekli Tepe was oneof the key points of origin of the Neolithic revolution, meaning that for ourpresent civilization at least this is where history begins.GÖBEKLI TEPE IN CONTEXTBefore going any further, it is important to place Göbekli Tepe in context withwhat is known about the emergence of the civilized world. Its earliestenclosures, which are by far the most sophisticated, existed as much as seventhousand years before the construction of Stonehenge in southern England, builtaround 3000 BC. Yet having said this, mounting evidence indicates that theStonehenge we see today, with its familiar sarsen trilithons, Heel Stonealignment toward the midsummer sunrise, and bluestone horseshoe of standingstones, is simply the final phase of an evolution that began with the creationof a Mesolithic complex as early as 8000 BC. Who was responsible for thisproto-Stonehenge thousands of years before the arrival on British shores of thefirst Neolithic farmers remains a mystery. Whatever the answer, the fact thatthis early date of construction coincides with the final abandonment of GöbekliTepe must raise a few eyebrows and suggests there might have been a much greatercommunication network between prehistoric cultures than is currently accepted byscholars.EGYPT’S FIRST TIMEGöbekli Tepe is also a full seven thousand years older than the conventionaldates attributed to the construction of the Great Pyramid and its neighbors onEgypt’s famous plateau at Giza. Even if we accept these monuments as the productof Egypt’s pharaonic age, the evidence presented both by me and my colleagueRobert Bauval in a number of our books suggests very strongly that much earlierstructures must have existed in the Nile Valley during a mythical age referredto by the dynastic Egyptians as Zep Tepi, the First Time. It is a time when thegods themselves—Osiris, Isis, Seth, Horus, Thoth, and others—are said to havewalked the earth.An obvious marker of this age of the gods is the Great Sphinx, the leoninemonument that sits on the eastern edge of the plateau at Giza—its gaze fixedtoward the eastern horizon, where the sun rises at the time of the equinoxes.During the mid-1990s convincing evidence was put forward by Boston geologist Dr.Robert Schoch and his colleague John Anthony West to suggest that the Sphinx isnot the product of the Fourth Dynasty, when pharaohs such as Khufu, Khafre, andMenkaure built the surrounding pyramid complexes, but dates to a much earlierepoch of humankind. It might even be possible that this timeless monument wasoriginally created to gaze at its celestial counterpart, the constellation ofLeo, when that noble asterism last housed the equinoctial sun between theeleventh millennium BC and the ninth millennium BC.Such a realization, if verified, would make the Sphinx pretty much contemporarywith Göbekli Tepe, which lies at a distance of around 700 miles (1,100kilometers) from Egypt’s Nile Valley.LION PILLAR BUILDINGIt is therefore a matter of great interest that there are striking carvings ofadvancing lions on the inner faces of twin pillars in an east-west alignedenclosure at Göbekli Tepe dated to the ninth millennium BC. Called the “LionPillars Building,” the structure’s leonine pillars form a gateway at its easternend, their advancing beasts appearing to rear out of the equinoctial horizon.As Andrew Collins points out elsewhere,2 [index_split_058.html#filepos920038]there is every possibility that to the Göbekli builders this leonine art notonly signified the blood-red might of the sun (like the lion-headed goddesses ofancient Egypt), but also the influence of the constellation of Leo, thecelestial lion, as it rose in the predawn light of the spring equinox.So the same inspiration behind the construction of the Great Sphinx might alsohave been present at Göbekli Tepe, leading us to ask whether there is a realconnection between these two distant places. If so, was the emergence of highculture in both the Nile Valley and southeast Turkey related in some manner tothe creation of proto-Stonehenge by an unknown culture that thrived during thevery same epoch? Were all these sites, and many more besides, once connected insome unfathomable manner?FORGOTTEN CIVILIZATIONIn books such as Fingerprints of the Gods (1995), Heaven’s Mirror (1998,authored with my wife, Santha Faiia), and the sequel to Fingerprints of theGods, which I am writing for publication in 2015, I make the case for a globalcivilization, possessing immense technical sophistication and a profoundunderstanding of our place in the cosmos, that thrived in an age before aterrible cataclysm brought the world to its knees soon after the end of the lastice age.More than ever before, science is piecing together exactly what occurred duringthis global catastrophe, which is now firmly dated to ca. 10,900–10,800 BC. Itis a moment in time known to paleoclimatologists as the Younger Dryas horizon,which defines the boundary between the Pleistocene geological epoch and theHolocene, which we still live in today.It was a time also when the glaciers that had covered much of the NorthernHemisphere during the Ice Age began rapidly to readvance, for the Younger Dryasis the name given to a mini ice age that gripped the world for a period ofaround thirteen hundred years, from approximately 10,900 BC onward, and endedabruptly around the time the first major enclosures were under construction atGöbekli Tepe, ca. 9600–9500 BC.It seems certain, now, that the cause of this worldwide catastrophe was a largecomet that fragmented into thousands of pieces as it entered the upperatmosphere. Each fragment rained down on the earth, causing unimaginabledetonations that pulverized vast swathes of land across the planet. Not only didthis terrible cataclysm trigger the onset of the Younger Dryas mini ice age andwith it the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna, including the mammoth,mastodon, toxodon, great camel, and great sloth, but it also devastated theworld’s human population. The worst hit areas were on the American continent.Here the impact blasts, each one as powerful as a small atomic bomb, were morewidespread than anywhere else.CATASTROPHOBIAAndrew, in this groundbreaking book, proposes that Göbekli Tepe was built as aresponse to the aftermath of this global cataclysm. The earliest enclosures werecreated, he postulates, by a hunter-gatherer populace still in fear of anothercomet impact, even though several hundred years had elapsed since the finalreverberations of this catastrophic event.Each structure, with its beautifully carved stones, was built with the specificpurpose of preserving cosmic order through shamanic interactions with the unseenworld. This was achieved using an idealized cosmology, envisaged as a sky pole,or umbilicus, linking earth and heaven. In this way the hunter-gatherers, underthe instruction of a ruling elite, were able to maintain the status quo of thecosmos and prevent further attacks on the sky pole, the axis of heaven, from acosmic trickster in the guise of a supernatural fox or wolf.It was this absolute fear of another cosmic catastrophe, something thatvisionary writer Barbara Hand Clow refers to so aptly as catastrophobia, thatcaused the hunter-gatherers of southeast Turkey to suddenly start supersizingtheir cult buildings into the beautiful megalithic structures we see today.It was also this obsession with preventing another cataclysm that wasresponsible, at least in part, for the collective amnesia that has allowed us tofilter out and reject the existence of the proposed global civilization thatthrived in the epoch immediately prior to the Younger Dryas Boundary impactevent, as scientists call it today.Yet some expression of the complex cosmology existing during this former goldenage is almost certainly locked into the design, proportion, and carved art atGöbekli Tepe. It thus becomes a virtual Noah’s ark in stone, bridging the gapbetween a former age of enlightenment and the emergence down on the MesopotamiaPlain of some of the oldest known civilizations of this current world age, mostobviously those of Sumer, Akkad, Assyria, and Babylon.ABODE OF THE GODSThe mythologies of these great civilizations speak clearly of wisdom bringersand creator gods responsible for the formation of the earliest towns, cities,canals, walled enclosures, and irrigation channels—and even of humankind. Namedas the Anunnaki, these anthropomorphic, or humanlike, gods are said to haveemerged from a primeval mound called Duku, situated on a cosmic mountain namedKharsag, beneath which was the world of mortal human beings.Klaus Schmidt believes that Göbekli Tepe had a direct impact on the myths andlegends regarding the Anunnaki, and that the site could be the role model forthe original Duku mound. Indeed, he goes further, as Andrew points out in thisbook, by hinting at a connection between Göbekli Tepe and biblical traditionsconcerning the Garden of Eden, and perhaps even the very human angels of Hebrewmythological tradition known as the Watchers.CULT OF THE VULTUREA deep look at the description of the Watchers and their offspring, theNephilim, in ancient Jewish texts such as the book of Enoch makes it clear thatthese mythical creatures were not incorporeal angels, but flesh and blood humanbeings with very distinct shamanistic qualities. They are occasionally said towear dark, iridescent cloaks, or feather coats, and on occasion they take flightlike birds, echoing the presence among the earliest proto-Neolithic communitiesof the Near East of a cult of death and rebirth focused on scavenger birds suchas the vulture.As Andrew points out, at Göbekli Tepe, as well as at the nine-thousandyear-oldNeolithic city of Çatal Höyük in southern-central Turkey, there are abstractrepresentations of vultures with articulated legs. Either they are shamansadorned as birds or bird spirits with anthropomorphic features.Were these shamans of the early Neolithic age role models for the Watchers ofEnochian tradition? Are the Watchers a vague memory of those behind theconstruction of proto-Neolithic complexes, amongst them Göbekli Tepe insoutheast Turkey? Did the Watchers really introduce this current world age toforbidden knowledge carried over from a global civilization that once thrived inan antediluvian world?FROM THE ASHES OF ANGELSThese are questions we are only now beginning to ask for the first time. Yetthey were asked as far back as 1996 by Andrew Collins in his groundbreaking bookFrom the Ashes of Angels. What is more, there is little question that Andrew wasone of the first writers to realize the greater significance of Göbekli Tepe,bringing it to the attention of the mysteries community as early as 2004. It isfor this reason that his book Göbekli Tepe: Genesis of the Gods is such amasterwork, for it is the culmination of nearly twenty years of Andrew’soriginal research into the origins of the Neolithic revolution and itsrelationship to Hebrew traditions concerning the location of the Garden of Edenand the human truth behind the Watchers of the book of Enoch.In a testimonial written to accompany the publication of From the Ashes ofAngels, I said that Andrew had “put important new facts before the publicconcerning the mysterious origins of human civilization.” I stand by thisstatement and add only that with his vast knowledge of the subject underdiscussion, there is no one better suited to reveal Göbekli Tepe’s place inhistory today.Graham Hancock, born in Edinburgh, Scotland, is a British writer and journalist.His books, including Fingerprints of the Gods, The Sign and The Seal, andHeaven’s Mirror, have sold more than five million copies worldwide and have beentranslated into twenty-seven languages.

Ever since kindergarten I have had a strange fascinationwith angels. Back then I was forced to endure Sunday school on a regular basis,and what I heard about Moses parting the Red Sea or Jesus feeding the fivethousand with just a few loaves and fishes intrigued me. I loved hearing aboutmiracles. Yet the lessons were always long and dreary. I wished only to be inthe park, kicking about a soccer ball with my dad and brother.Then one day my Sunday school teacher, a rather stern-faced woman, related howthe Old Testament prophet Abraham received into his presence three angels. Theysat with him beneath the shade of a tree, where they talked and ate foodtogether.I knew about angels, those with radiant bodies and beautiful wings, but what theteacher was implying seemed at odds with this ethereal view. Not only did angelsseem to function in this world, but they could also be tangibly real. What’smore, people could talk to them and perhaps even become their friends. This wasan incredible revelation to me.Abraham’s meeting with the angels was not lingered on, causing me to raise myhand and ask: “Please miss, what are angels?” To which I was told: “They aremessengers of God.”I needed to know more, so I asked the teacher to elaborate further. She justlooked at me and said, slowly and decisively: “There is nothing to beexplained—they are the angels of God.”For her, the existence of angels seemed arbitrary, so my curiosity bore nomeaning or relevance. Yet clearly it mattered to me.It was a moment in my life I shall never forget. Somehow it fired my interest inangels as corporeal creatures and was one of the reasons I was here in southeastTurkey, making my way through sun-baked, dusty streets looking for answers. Allaround me were market vendors plying their wares, stalls brimming with ripemelons, trays of tomatoes, and all manner of household goods sold at verycompetitive prices.Amid the incessant din, I gazed up at an age-old stone archway, the only openingthrough a more or less intact wall of some considerable size. Beyond it, as faras the eye could see, were the ruins of an ancient city razed to the ground bythe Mongol hoards in 1271. Known as Carrhae to the Romans, this sprawlingMesopotamian metropolis—a commercial center at the crossroads of several keytrading routes—is better known by the name Harran.All that remains of the ancient city today are a scattering of walls; a massivestone arch marking the entrance to the now-vanished Great Mosque; a ruinedcastle, built in the early Islamic period on the site of a pagan templededicated to the Mesopotamian moon god Sin; and a colossal stone structure,rising to a height of 110 feet (33 meters) and known locally as the AstronomicalTower. Although it too once formed part of the Great Mosque—or Paradise Mosque,as it was more correctly known—legend asserts that the Harranites, theinhabitants of Harran, were keen astronomers who used the tower’s summit toobserve and record the movement of the stars.Although the Harranites acknowledged the faith of Islam following the Arabconquest, many belonged to an altogether different faith—one that came to beknown as Sabaeanism. These curious people worshipped the sun, moon, and planets,which they honored in temples built specifically for this purpose. In additionto this, they saw the Pole Star, and the northern night sky in general, as thedirection of the Primal Cause, of God himself, a fact celebrated each year in agrand festival known as the Mystery of the North. This fascination with the PoleStar was a belief shared by other religious sects of the region including theIsmaili Brethren of Purity, the Mandaeans of Iraq and Iran, and theangel-worshipping Yezidi, all of whom owe at least some part of their existenceto the Sabaeans of Harran.In addition to being star worshippers, the Harranites are said to have collatedthe sacred writings of Greco-Roman Egypt attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, theThrice Great Hermes. Following the destruction of Harran in the thirteenthcentury, this important corpus of religious literature known as the Hermeticawas carried into Europe, where, some one and a half centuries later, it becamethe spiritual backbone to the Italian Renaissance and, with it, a revival of allthings Egyptian.Yet before even the Sabaeans flourished in Harran, the city was connected withthe earliest events of the Bible. Here the prophet Abraham and his family stayedprior to their departure to Canaan, God’s Promised Land. Local tradition assertsthat the prophet hailed from the nearby city of Şanlıurfa, the original “Ur ofthe Chaldees.” So strong is this belief that even today thousands of KurdishMuslims arrive in the city, anciently known as Orfa, Orhay, or Edessa, in orderto visit a cave shrine said to be the birthplace of the great prophet.According to medieval belief, Abraham arrived at Harran and at once set aboutconverting the local population to his monotheistic faith. Yet the Harranitesclaimed their teachings were older, having derived from Seth, the son of Adam,and Enoch, a later antediluvian patriarch. Some of the Harranites did convert toAbraham’s faith and departed with him to Canaan. Those who did not are said tohave remained in the neighborhood of Harran, declaring that “we acknowledge thereligion of Seth, Idris (Enoch) and Noah.”1 [index_split_058.html#filepos920437]So much did the inhabitants of Harran honor Abraham’s presence in the city thata temple was set up to him and his father, Terah, which apparently stood 2parsangs (around 7 miles, or 11 kilometers) southeast of the city, close to theborder with Syria.2 [index_split_058.html#filepos920670] Abraham was theperceived father of the Jewish people, and his descendants were responsible forbringing together the source material for the book of Genesis, the first book ofthe Old Testament, traditionally ascribed to Moses the Lawgiver.Everywhere around Harran are sites associated with stories from the book ofGenesis. On Cudi Dağ (Mount al-Judi), in the mountains to the east of Harran,Noah’s ark is said to have made first landfall after the waters of the GreatFlood receded. Here too Noah established his first post-Flood settlement,leaving his son Shem to continue his journey into the Eastern Taurus Mountains,where also Seth, the son of Adam, lived after his father and mother’s expulsionfrom the Garden of Eden (see chapters 35 and 37). Even Harran itself, whereAbraham dwelled with his family, had more ancient biblical connections, astradition insists that Cainan, a grandson of Shem, founded the city. He was theoriginator of Chaldaism, the knowledge of the stars as practiced by the Sabaeansof Harran.3 [index_split_058.html#filepos920804]More significantly, the book of Genesis records that the primordial Garden whereAdam and Eve, the First Couple, existed in a state of innocence and bliss beforethe time of the Fall was located at the source of the four rivers of Paradise,two of which can easily be identified as the Tigris and Euphrates (see chapter27). They take their rise in the mountains to the northeast of Harran. Heresomewhere lies the original Garden of Eden, tended over by the angels of God,returning me to the pressing questions that had preoccupied my childhood: Who orwhat are angels? Where did they come from, and did they have some kind ofearthly tangibility?As I climbed Harran’s giant occupational mound, which rises above the ruinedcity, and stared out toward the mesmeric Astronomical Tower, I felt I wasgetting closer to some real answers. For even as the first Bible stories werebeing played out across the region, Harran was already extremely old.Archaeological fieldwork has shown that its earliest inhabitants occupied thesite as much as eight thousand years ago,4 [index_split_058.html#filepos921040]having arrived here from another occupational mound, located just 6 miles (10kilometers) away, which dates back an incredible ten thousand years.5[index_split_058.html#filepos921286]Known as Tell Idris, the very name of this prehistoric mound reveals itsassociation not just with the earliest events of the Bible but also with theangelic beings said to have guarded the Garden of Eden. For Idris is the Arabicname for the antediluvian patriarch Enoch, the great-grandfather of Noah. He isaccredited with the authorship of one of the strangest and most mystifyingreligious texts ever written.Called the book of Enoch, it recounts how Enoch, while resting in his bed onenight, is approached by two strange beings of angelic appearance. Named Watchers(Hebrew ‘îrîn), they ask him to accompany them on a tour of the Seven Heavens,one of which includes the Garden of Righteousness, where the four rivers ofParadise take their rise, while another leads to the abode of the angels.When in the Watchers’ heavenly settlement, Enoch is shown a prison in which awhole group of these angelic beings are incarcerated. On asking what crime theyhave committed, the patriarch is informed that two hundred of their numberdisobeyed the laws of heaven by descending among mortal kind and taking wivesfor themselves. As a consequence, these women gave birth to giant offspringcalled Nephilim (a Hebrew word meaning “those who fell” or the “fallen ones”).More significantly, the book of Enoch relates how the rebel Watchers, who aredescribed as extremely tall (like “trees”), with pale and ruddy skin, powerfuleyes, white hair, and long, viper-like faces (see chapter 32), are said to havetaught their mortal wives the arts and sciences of heaven. For this heinouscrime they were rounded up and incarcerated.Although these stories are understandably dismissed as allegorical fantasy bytheologians and Bible scholars alike, there is an air about them that tells of aforgotten event in humanity’s distant past—one connected integrally with Harranand the surrounding region, for it was here that the Neolithic revolution began.On the upper reaches of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, in the region that istoday made up of eastern Turkey, northern Syria, northern Iraq, and northwestIran, animal husbandry occurred for the first time, as did the domestication ofwild cereals and the first metalworking and smelting. Here too some of theearliest baked and fired statuettes were produced, along with the constructionof rectilinear and curvilinear buildings, some incorporating decorated standingstones and steles. With them came the first construction of terrazzo mortarfloors, the first evidence for brewing beer, and perhaps even the first use ofgrapes to produce wine.In the same region, as early as 8000 BC, diamond-hard stone drills were employedto pierce holes through large oval beads of carnelian and agate to producebeautiful necklaces, and green malachite powder was first used as a cosmetic tobeautify the eyes.Among the forbidden arts of heaven that the Watchers are said to have giftedmortal kind are the use of metals and metalworking, and the means for women tobeautify themselves. They are also said to have provided the first polishedmirrors, an interesting fact, as the earliest known mirrors, made of the blackvolcanic glass obsidian, were manufactured at early Neolithic sites in centralTurkey, such as Çatal Höyük and Aşıklı Höyük.Is it possible that some memory of the prime movers or driving elite behind thisgreat transition in technology and innovation is recalled in the stories of theWatchers providing mortal kind with the rudiments of civilization? Is this whatthese human angels are—instigators of the Neolithic revolution?Here at Harran are further clues to this baffling mystery. From the summit ofits occupational mound the eye is drawn beyond the Astronomical Tower to the lowridge of mountains that dominates the northern horizon. Amid those peaks and infull sight of the Sabaean city is an archaeological site of incredibleimportance to world history.Known as Göbekli Tepe, its existence, and the work currently being carried outthere by a dedicated team of specialists, might one day help answer the pressingquestions that have haunted me since childhood. Here, on a hilly ridge close tothe southernmost limits of the Anti-Taurus Mountains, is the oldest acknowledgedmonumental architecture anywhere in the world. It takes the form of a series ofcircular and rectangular stone sanctuaries constructed as early as 9500 BC by anadvanced group of hunter-gatherers who might well have been responsible forcatalyzing the genesis of civilization in a manner echoing the very human-likeactivities of the Watchers in the book of Enoch.Who were the builders of Göbekli Tepe, and what motivated them to construct suchextraordinary monuments so soon after the end of the last ice age? What part ofthe ancient world did they come from, and what did they look like? Is itpossible that a memory of their existence was preserved by the peoples of theregion and later carried by the descendants of Abraham into the Holy Land, whereit inspired the stories of angels trafficking with humankind preserved inreligious texts such as the book of Enoch and book of Genesis?Remarkably, an ancient Hebrew work known as the book of Jubilees, which alsotells the story of the Watchers, relates how Cainan, the legendary founder ofHarran, uncovered an inscription carved on a stone stela. When translated it wasfound to contain the antediluvian science of astrology as taught by theWatchers.6 [index_split_058.html#filepos921445] This knowledge went on to formthe basis of the beliefs of the Chaldeans; that is, the pagans of Harran, whoseprogenitor is said to have been Cainan’s father, Arphaxad, the son of Shem andgrandson of Noah.7 [index_split_058.html#filepos921566] The name Arphaxad simplymeans “Ur of the Chaldees,”8 [index_split_058.html#filepos921729] taking us backto the site of Abraham’s birthplace in nearby Şanlıurfa.Was the stone stela found by Cainan and said to reveal the astrologicalknowledge of the Watchers a reference to the beautifully carved T-shaped pillarsfound at nearby Göbekli Tepe, some of which, as we see in part two of this book,seem to reflect a profound knowledge of the starry heavens during the epoch oftheir construction? Was this the true source of the Harranites’ starry wisdom,adopted from their forerunners, who inhabited Tell Idris and other similar earlyNeolithic settlements on the Harran Plain as much as ten thousand years ago?Further linking the Harran region with the Watchers is the belief that the cityof Şanlıurfa, where a settlement site belonging to the same culture responsiblefor Göbekli Tepe was uncovered near Abraham’s birthplace during the 1990s, wasfounded either by the patriarch Enoch9 [index_split_058.html#filepos921878] orby “Orhay son of Hewya,” with hewya meaning “serpent.”10[index_split_058.html#filepos922005] Almost certainly, this serpentine founderof the city is an allusion to the Watchers, who are themselves occasionallydescribed as Serpents (see chapter 34). Was it here, in Şanlıurfa, that Enochmet with the two Watchers who took him on a tour of the Seven Heavens, amountainous realm that included the Garden of Righteousness?What exactly was the Garden of Eden, where Adam and Eve are said to have livedin a state of perpetual bliss before the time of the Fall? Was this the truehome of the Watchers of the book of Enoch? Could its discovery hold the key tounderstanding the origins behind humankind’s contact with angels during someformer age? Did it exist at Göbekli Tepe or somewhere else—in the mountains tothe northeast, perhaps, where the four rivers of Paradise take their rise?Only by understanding the mysteries of Göbekli Tepe would any real answers beforthcoming, and so it is here that our quest must begin, starting with itsrediscovery in 1994 by a brilliant-minded German archaeologist, to whom we oweits existence today.I will ask the reader to bear with me now as I switch from a first person to athird person narrative in order to determine who built Göbekli Tepe, and why. Mypersonal quest is resumed in part four, when a powerful dream initiates a freshsearch for the source of the terrestrial Paradise.It is an intellectual adventure that will culminate not only in the discovery ofEden but also in the realization that the true meaning behind humanity’s fallfrom grace, in the wake of the Neolithic revolution, is integrally bound up withthe secret writings of Seth, the son of Adam. These forgotten books of Seth,glimpses of which can be found in Gnostic literature, tell us that in order totruly return to Paradise and partake of the immortality offered by the Tree ofLife, we must first become like angels ourselves, as once we were in the Gardenof Eden."},{"pageContent":"PART ONEConstruction[images/00125.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"1A LIFETIME’S WORKOne day in October 1994 Professor Klaus Schmidt, an archaeologist working withthe German Archaeological Institute and the University of Heidelberg, made thetrek out to a bleak limestone plateau, situated close to the southernmost limitsof the Anti-Taurus Mountains, just 8 miles (13 kilometers) northeast of theTurkish city of Şanlıurfa. It was a decision that would change his life foreverand alter the very way we perceive the rise of civilization in the ancientworld.Schmidt’s intention was to inspect a large artificial mound composed of earthand rock debris, which sits on a mountain ridge that rises to a height of justunder half a mile (780 meters) above sea level. Stretching away toward the southlay the Harran Plain, where the patriarch Abraham is said to have set out on hisjourney to the Promised Land some seven thousand years after the incredibleevents that gave rise to the almost alien world that awaited discovery here atGöbekli Tepe, the “hill of the navel.”1 [index_split_058.html#filepos922200]SITE V52/1Schmidt knew that as early as 1963 a joint team from the universities ofIstanbul and Chicago had visited the site and identified a number of “knolls,”or rises, that cover an area of some 3.5 acres (1.44 hectares)—a figure extendedto 22 acres (9 hectares) following a geomagnetic survey of the site in 2003.2[index_split_058.html#filepos922367]The 1963 expedition noted that immediately west of Göbekli Tepe’s rounded summitprehistoric stone tools lay strewn across a wide area. They belonged to an agewhen the inhabitants of southeast Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) were making thetransition from hunter-gatherers to settled pastoralists and farmers.The survey team also recorded the presence at Göbekli Tepe (documented as siteV52/1) of cut and dressed slabs of limestone bearing evidence of carved relief.Team member Peter Benedict, an anthropologist with the University of Chicago,concluded the fragments came from a lost Byzantine cemetery. It was a decisioninfluenced perhaps by the fact that the local Kurdish community consider thetepe or tell—these being, respectively, the Turkish and Arabic words for a largeartificial mound created by human occupation—as sacred, using it themselves as acemetery for their dead. At its summit, modern graves lie within a walledenclosure clustered around a single fig-mulberry tree, a sight clearly visibleto anyone approaching the mountain from the plain below.SUBLIME SOPHISTICATIONGöbekli Tepe was not investigated further, with the entire matter being confinedto a single report published in 1980.3 [index_split_058.html#filepos922544]Instead, the joint Istanbul-Chicago team concentrated their efforts onexcavating an important early Neolithic site at Çayönü Tepesi, located 4 miles(6 kilometers) southwest of the town of Ergani, northwest of the city ofDiyarbakır. Having thrived, in the main, between ca. 8630 BC and 6820 BC, Çayönüis noted for the discovery there of a series of rectangular buildings withdistinctive “grill-plan” subfloors composed of low, parallel walls of stone,possibly to allow air to pass freely beneath the main flooring. Here too wasfound some of the earliest evidence for the use of copper, beaten into shape,not smelted, along with evidence of animal husbandry in the form of pigdomestication and the earliest known use of linen fabric, a piece being foundstill wrapped around an antler.The site’s lead excavators, American archaeologist and anthropologist Robert J.Braidwood (1907–2003) and Turkish academic Dr. Halet Çambel, also came acrossother examples of advanced building design and technical achievement at Çayönü.In addition to the grill-plan floors, one structure, dubbed the FlagstoneBuilding, was found to possess a floor of polished limestone slabs up to 6.5feet (2 meters) in length. Two tall stone pillars stood in the center of theroom, with rows of orthostats (stone posts) set up against the interior walls.4[index_split_058.html#filepos922702]Another structure, known as the Terrazzo Building, bore a slightly different,although no less impressive, style of flooring. It consisted of a 16-inch (40centimeter)-thick setting of terrazzo, a hard, polished surface made from burntand crushed lime and clay, stained red with a substance called ochre. Into this,two parallel rows of white pebbles had been inserted to create a linear designof simple beauty. Orthostats again lined the interior walls, while a pair ofstanding stones, like those in the Flagstone Building, had been set up in themiddle of the room.Prior to the discovery of Çayönü, the use of orthostats had been found in just afew rare instances. For instance, at a proto-Neolithic site in northern Iraqnamed Qermez Dere, located on a south-facing mountain slope overlooking a vastdesert expanse known as the Jezirah, stone pillars, their tops carved into thelikeness of human shoulders and arms, were found to have stood at the center oftwo circular buildings with plaster floors. Both structures provided dates inthe region of the early tenth millennium BC.5[index_split_058.html#filepos922906]SANGUINE DISCOVERIESIn one of the enclosures at Çayönü archaeologists discovered, both in the wallsand beneath the floor, human skulls belonging to around seventy individuals. Inone pit excavators came across large numbers of disarticulated human bones, mostof them long bones, which, along with the skulls, suggested the presence of noless than 450 individuals. What fate had befallen them, and under whatcircumstances, remains unclear.Unsurprisingly, this apparent mortuary structure, which had a round apse at itsnorthern end, became known as the Skull Building, although it was whatexcavators found on an enormous cut and polished stone slab, 1.1 U.S. tons(about 1 metric tonne) in weight and set up like an altar table, that mostdisturbed them. On its surface were clear traces of blood from aurochs (anextinct species of wild cattle) and humans, in the form of crystals andhemoglobin.6 [index_split_058.html#filepos923079] Equally disturbing was thediscovery next to the stone slab of a vicious-looking flint knife, likesomething out of an Aztec temple.Some pressing questions arise regarding the presence of human blood insideÇayönü’s cult buildings. Was it the result of human sacrifice or autosacrifice,personal blood-letting like that practiced in pre-Columbian times amongMesoamerican civilizations such as the Aztec and Maya? Perhaps the matter isbest left alone until a much clearer picture emerges of what was really going onhere. Yet whatever the answer, it would seem that, during the early Neolithicage, beauty, sophistication, and advances in technology and architectural designwent hand in hand with dark, sanguine activities, just as they would thousandsof years later among the peoples of Central and South America.NEOLITHIZATIONFor those who study the prehistory of the Near East, the transitional agebetween the hunter-gatherers of the late Paleolithic age and the later Neolithicfarmers and herders is styled the Pre-Pottery Neolithic, a term devised byBritish archaeologist Dame Kathleen Kenyon (1906–1978) following her extensiveexcavations at Jericho in the 1950s. It is a term used much in this book,although in its formative stage this era is described as the proto-Neolithicperiod, while in Europe this same epoch is called the Mesolithic age (see figure1.1 on p. 22).The Pre-Pottery (i.e., preceramic) Neolithic age is split into two separatephases—A and B. The Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) is generally seen to haveoccurred between ca. 9500 BC and 8500 BC, with the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B(PPNB) taking place between ca. 8700 BC and 6000 BC.7[index_split_058.html#filepos923283] This marked the appearance of subsistenceagriculture; that is, the domestication of plants and cereals, as well as thegrowing of crops on a large scale. Thereafter came the Pottery Neolithic, ca.6400–4500 BC, when “neolithization” really began. It was an age not just offired pottery but also of the rapid spread of agriculture from Western Asia intoother parts of the ancient world, such as Europe, Central Asia, and the IndusValley of India and Pakistan.ARCHAEOLOGICAL MINEFIELDProfessor Klaus Schmidt was mainly concerned with the Pre-Pottery Neolithic onhis first visit to Göbekli Tepe. He understood full well why the JointIstanbul-Chicago Prehistoric Survey Team had focused their attentions on Çayönüinstead of better investigating Göbekli Tepe, for, as he said himself: “Time wasnot ripe to recognize the real importance of this site . . . [so] Göbekli Tepepassed into oblivion, and it seems quite clear that no archaeologist returned tothe site until the author’s visit in 1994.”8[index_split_058.html#filepos923454][images/00109.jpg]Figure 1.1. Chart showing dates of the Near Eastern cultures, civilizations, andpaleoclimatological ages mentioned in this book.Thankfully, Schmidt did make the decision to visit Göbekli Tepe and see forhimself what the site had to offer, and it took him very little time to realizethat beneath the huge artificial mound of reddish brown earth and compactedstone chippings, a Pre-Pottery Neolithic complex of immense significance awaiteddiscovery.Schmidt also realized that the carved stone fragments scattered about GöbekliTepe were more than simply funerary slabs belonging to some lost Byzantinecemetery. They closely resembled pillars unearthed at another Pre-PotteryNeolithic site, named Nevalı Çori9 [index_split_058.html#filepos923603] (seefigure 1.2), located on a hill slope overlooking a branch of the EuphratesRiver, halfway between Şanlıurfa and Diyarbakır, some 30 miles (48 kilometers)north-northeast of Göbekli Tepe. He knew this because he had worked at the siteunder the auspices of fellow German archaeologist Dr. Harald Hauptmann from 1983through to 1992, when the rising waters of the Euphrates submerged Nevalı Çorifollowing the construction of the Atatürk Dam.[images/00120.jpg]Figure 1.2. Map showing Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites in southwest Asia mentionedin this book.THE CULT BUILDINGNevalı Çori was found to consist of a series of rectangular buildings clusteredtogether to form a village settlement, which thrived between 8500 BC and 7600BC; that is, from the end of the PPNA into the PPNB period. Among the structuresuncovered by Hauptmann and his team was one much grander than the rest. Its rearwall backed up to the hill slope, while its interior walls, made of quarrystone, included a communal benchlike feature. This was divided into sections byequally spaced stone pillars, each with a T-shaped or inverted L-liketermination. During one of its earliest building phases, designated Level II anddating to ca. 8400–8000 BC, twelve standing pillars had stood within its walls(two on each side and one in each corner), with the number increasing tothirteen during the next phase, designated Level III, ca. 8000 BC (see figure1.3). Like its counterpart at Çayönü, Nevalı Çori’s megalithic structurepossessed a terrazzo floor of burnt lime cement, beneath which was a subfloor ofhuge stone slabs.During the Level II building phase, a squared-off niche was constructed into therear wall of the cult building. Here excavators found an elongated carved headwith its face missing. Nicknamed the “skinhead,” it is roughly life size andlooks like an egg with ears. On its reverse is a highly unusual sikha, a longponytail that resembles a wriggling snake with its head shaped like a mushroomcap. The “skinhead” originated, most probably, from a full-size statue, whichhaving become detached from its body, had been hidden away within the building’snorth wall.THE GREAT MONOLITHThe item placed within the building’s terrazzo floor, however, was what mostcompelled the excavators, for standing in the center of the room were theremains of a tall, rectangular pillar bearing an uncanny likeness to the blackobsidian monolith that appeared among the apelike creatures at the beginning ofStanley Kubrick’s movie adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke’s 2001: A Space Odyssey(figure 1.4).[images/00127.jpg]Figure 1.3. Nevalı Çori’s cult building, showing cutaways for Levels II and III,ca. 8400–8000 BC.[images/00132.jpg]Figure 1.4. Nevalı Çori’s cult building, showing the surviving central monolithstill in situ.[images/00059.jpg]Figure 1.5. One of the stone pillars from Nevalı Çori. Note the stylized arms,hands, stole, and neck pendant.The pillar, originally 10 feet (3 meters) high, had been carved to represent anabstract human form. In relief across its two widest faces were thin arms, bentat the elbow, with hands and fingers curling around to its front, narrow edge(see figure 1.5 schematic). Anthropomorphic shaping had previously been notedamong the remains of the twelve to thirteen standing pillars that had beenerected within the building’s four walls, but that displayed on the centralpillar was far more accomplished. Above the figure’s hands were two parallelgrooves, or chiseled vertical lines, clearly meant to represent the double hemof a woven garment, open to the waist, which some have seen as a scarflikestole, similar to that worn by a Catholic priest.A broken fragment of the same pillar lay nearby. Its base matched the top of thestanding remnant, although its upper end was so damaged that no semblance of theindividual’s head could be discerned. In spite of this, it was clear from thepresence of the other stone pillars in the walls that this much larger monolithwould once have had a T-shaped termination, creating a hammerlike head. As such,it constituted one of the world’s oldest known 3-D representations of the humanform.A hole in the terrazzo floor close to the standing pillar showed that a secondmonolith must have stood parallel to it, although any trace of its presence hadlong since disappeared. Like the stone pillars in the walls, the twin pillarsperhaps functioned as roof supports, although this is by no means certain. Twinsets of standing pillars had been found in the Flagstone Building and TerrazzoBuilding at Çayönü. Yet here it was the stone slabs’ wider faces, and not one oftheir narrow sides, that had greeted the entrant approaching from the south.A PERSONAL DIVINITYSo who or what did the twin pillars represent? Archaeologists at the timesuggested they symbolized a “personal divinity.”10[index_split_058.html#filepos923703] This might have been so, but it did notexplain why there were two monoliths side by side or why they faced out towardthe cult building’s southwesterly placed entrance (the building was found to beoriented almost exactly northeast to southwest). Perhaps the pillars werepositioned to greet the entrant, like twin genii loci (spirits of the place)guarding the enclosure’s inner sanctum. Very likely this presumed liminal, orsacred, area signified an otherworldly environment that existed beyond themundane world. Indeed, it probably reflected the presence of a parallel realm, asupernatural world, accessible either in death or through the attainment ofdeathlike trances and other forms of altered states of consciousness, with theaim being to communicate with power animals, great ancestors, and mythicalbeings.11 [index_split_058.html#filepos923836]EXPLORING GÖBEKLI TEPEKlaus Schmidt had all this in mind as he examined the various carved fragmentsof “large-scale sculptures”12 [index_split_058.html#filepos924026] foundscattered about Göbekli Tepe. Quickly, he realized that “the entire area hadbeen used for the construction of megalithic architecture, not just a specificpart of it.”13 [index_split_058.html#filepos924176] He saw its function asritual in nature.14 [index_split_058.html#filepos924277] Indeed, Göbekli Tepe’sbuilding structures would, he felt, reflect the same cultic influences as thoseat Çayönü and Nevalı Çori.Having seen enough, Schmidt came to a frightening conclusion. If he did not turnaround and walk away now, he would be there for the rest of his life. As fatewould have it, he decided to stay and commit himself to excavating the sitefully, and we can be thankful for Schmidt’s decision, as it was afterwarddiscovered that the entire hillside was about to become an open quarry to supplyrock for the construction of the new Gaziantep to Mardin highway, a decisionthat was reversed only when the importance of the archaeological site becameknown.15 [index_split_058.html#filepos924378] So we can be pretty sure thatwithout the intervention of this quick-thinking German archaeologist, the worldmight never have gazed upon the oldest stone temple in the world."},{"pageContent":"2MONUMENTAL ARCHITECTUREUnder the joint auspices of the German Archaeological Institute and theArchaeological Museum at Şanlıurfa, Dr. Klaus Schmidt started work at GöbekliTepe in 1995. Very soon his team, made up of undergraduates from German andTurkish universities, as well as fifty local workers of Kurdish, Turkish, andArab ethnicity, began making remarkable discoveries. Beneath the mound’s topsoilhis team came across stone pillars set vertically into the ground. Each one wasfound to have a T-shaped head like those uncovered at Nevalı Çori.Two principal structures were investigated between 1995 and 1997 at GöbekliTepe. One—uncovered immediately west of the solitary fig-mulberry tree with itstiny walled cemetery of modern graves—was a rectangular enclosure that becameknown as the Lion Pillar Building because of the discovery at its eastern end oftwin pillars with carved reliefs of leaping lions on their inner faces (seeplate 17 [index_split_031.html#filepos432477]). The other was called the SnakePillar Building.SNAKE PILLAR BUILDINGThe Snake Pillar Building was located beneath the southern slope of theoccupational mound, some 50 feet (15 meters) lower in depth than the Lion PillarBuilding. Designated Enclosure A, it sits on the mountain’s limestone bedrock,suggesting its extreme age. Excavators found it to contain five T-shaped pillarsstanding about an arm’s length apart from one another. As at Nevalı Çori, theywere set within quarry stone walls with stepped benches, a thin layer of claymortar between each block.Two pillars stood parallel to each other, with another two placed on the samealignment outside of them; a fifth, south of the central pillars, stood withinthe perimeter wall, one of its narrow edges facing toward the center of the room(a sixth pillar was found just outside the interior walls). The inner pair ofstones acted as a gateway into a round apse containing a hemispherical stonebench, constructed at the rectangular structure’s northwest end; a similar apsehad previously been recorded in connection with Çayönü’s Skull Building. As wasthe case with Nevalı Çori’s cult building and Çayönü’s Terrazzo Building,Enclosure A possessed a perfectly level terrazzo floor that covered theunderlying bedrock.Like the pillars in the Lion Temple Building, those in Enclosure A turned out tobe revelations in prehistoric art. Pillar 1, the first to be exposed, bore onits front narrow face five slithering snakes, their heads pointing downward. Oneof the stone’s wide surfaces displayed more snakes interwoven to form amesh-like pattern of diamonds, collectively forming a snakeskin pattern (seefigure 2.1).Pillar 2 bore reliefs of an auroch, a leaping fox, and a wading bird, mostlikely a crane (see plate 4 [index_split_031.html#filepos427429]). At the top ofthe pillar’s front narrow edge, just beneath the overhang of the hammer-shapedhead, was a small bucranium (ox skull) in high relief. It faced outward towardthe viewer, and its whereabouts on the figure made an interpretation easy.Anthropomorphic pillars found at Nevalı Çori had been found to possess aV-shaped relief, like a neck collar, in exactly the same place. In other words,the bucranium was, most likely, a carved pendant or emblem of office, wornaround the “neck” of the figure.CULT OF THE SNAKEPillars 3 and 4 were without relief, while Pillar 5 bore yet anotherrepresentation of a snake. This strong presence of serpentine imagery on thecarved stones at Göbekli Tepe begged the question of just what this creaturemight have symbolized to the peoples of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic age.Universally, snakes are seen as symbols of supernatural power, divine energy,otherworldly knowledge, male and female sexuality, and, because they shed theirskin, metaphysical transformation. The snake also represents the active spiritof medicines, the reason it is today a universal symbol of the medicalprofession through its association with the cult of Asclepius, the Greek god ofmedicine and healing. Moreover, the snake is associated not just with beneficialmedicines, but also with those that bring forth hallucinations and even death.In Christian legend, for instance, poison offered to John the Evangelist in alaced chalice of wine was made to slither away as a black snake moments beforethe apostle was about to drink it.[images/00028.jpg]Figure 2.1. Snakes seen on Göbekli Tepe’s Pillar 1 in Enclosure A.Are the snakes carved on the pillars at Göbekli Tepe meant to symbolize thevisionary effects of psychotropic (mind-altering) or soporific (sleep-inducing)drugs? It seems likely, for as Schmidt writes himself, several large basaltbowls found at the site were perhaps used in the preparation of medicines ordrugs.1 [index_split_058.html#filepos924677]Visionary snakes are the most common creatures glimpsed by shamans and initiatesduring ecstatic or altered states of consciousness induced by mind-alteringsubstances, which among the indigenous peoples of the Amazonian rainforest ismost commonly the sacred brew called yagé or ayahuasca, known as the “vine ofthe soul.”2 [index_split_058.html#filepos925189] These serpentine creatures areseen as the active spirit of the drug and can even communicate with the shamanor initiate.More pertinent to the decorative art at Göbekli Tepe is that during yagé orayahuasca sessions, visionary snakes appear in such profusion that on occasionthey have been seen to wrap themselves enmass around either the experiencer ornearby houseposts,3 [index_split_058.html#filepos925365] creating an effect thatcannot be unlike the mesh or net of snakes represented on Enclosure A’s Pillar 1and found also on other standing stones uncovered at the site (see figure 2.2).So is this what the snake imagery at Göbekli Tepe shows, rare glimpses of thevisionary world experienced by the shaman? Whatever the answer, the presence ofso many snakes in Enclosure A was enough to convince Schmidt to christen it theSnake Pillar Building.ENCLOSURE B EXPOSEDIn 1998 and 1999 a new series of trenches, 29.5 feet (9 meters) square, wasopened at Göbekli Tepe. One, dug immediately north of the Snake Pillar Building,revealed the presence of a slightly larger structure, which became known asEnclosure B. This was found to be ovoid, measuring roughly 23 feet (7 meters) by28.5 feet (8.7 meters), with no less than nine T-shaped pillars—seven placedwithin its temenos (that is, boundary) wall and two set parallel to each otherin the center of a terrazzo floor—like those that had originally stood in NevalıÇori’s cult building. Schmidt remarked that it was like the “T-shapes,” as hecalls the anthropomorphic pillars, were gathered for “a meeting or dance.”4[index_split_058.html#filepos925476]Pillar 6 displayed carved reliefs of a reptile and snake, while those set up inthe center of the room (9 and 10) both bore T-shaped terminations andexquisitely carved leaping foxes on their inner faces. The creatures’ animatedstance made them appear as if they were jumping across the monolith, perhapstoward the entrant who would approach from the south, exactly in keeping withthe cult buildings at Çayönü, which also had entrances in the south.[images/00044.jpg]Figure 2.2. Left, poison escapes from the chalice of wine about to be drunk byJohn the Evangelist in the form of snakes, from a mosaic on the wall of thechurch of Saint John the Evangelist, New Ferry, Merseyside, England. Right,snakes on the front of Göbekli Tepe’s Pillar 31 in Enclosure D. Do theyrepresent the active spirit of medicines and poisons, or do they refer moreparticularly to visionary experiences induced through the use of psychoactivesubstances?NEW TEMPLES DISCOVEREDWork began around the same time on another structure of much greater size, whichbecame known as Enclosure C. Once again, T-shaped pillars were soon exposed, andthese too were set radially within stone walls containing the now familiar stonebenches. One monolith, designated Pillar 12, was found to bear a carved reliefon its T-shaped head, the first to do so. It showed five birds, either waders ora flightless species, amid a backdrop of V-shaped lines that were perhaps meantto represent water ripples. On the same pillar’s shaft was a “threatening boar”5[index_split_058.html#filepos925609] shown above a leaping fox. In front of thestone a portable sculpture of a boar was uncovered. Freestanding art of thiskind, including carved human heads, are often found to be fragments of muchlarger pieces of sculpture, such as carved stone totem poles or life-sizestatues.Soon after the discovery of Enclosure C, another massive building structure,Enclosure D, was uncovered immediately to its northwest. This would prove to beone of the oldest and most mysterious monuments ever uncovered in the ancientworld. Both enclosures, C and D, are described in full within subsequentchapters.DELIBERATE BURIALWhat started to become apparent to Schmidt’s team, as it removed the vastamounts of fill that covered the various building structures beneath the tell atGöbekli Tepe, is that each one had been deliberately buried beneath anever-expanding mound.6 [index_split_058.html#filepos925758] It was almost as ifthe idea of creating the bellylike tell, or tepe, was part of an original granddesign, with each new enclosure playing some role in its greater purpose, agradually evolving process that had taken some fifteen hundred years tocomplete. This ritual act of “killing,” or decommissioning, each enclosurebefore the construction of a new one to take its place would seem to haveoccurred in stages until around 8000 BC, when the remaining structures werecovered over and the site finally abandoned.7[index_split_058.html#filepos925858]For Schmidt and his team the burial of the enclosures was an immense bugbear, asit meant they were not easily able to determine the construction dates of thevarious monuments uncovered. Despite this problem, Schmidt was able to ascertainfrom the different types of flint tool found within the fill that the earliestphases of building activity uncovered at Göbekli Tepe belonged to the epochknown as Pre-Pottery Neolithic A, which began around 9500 BC.8[index_split_058.html#filepos926015]THE YOUNGER DRYAS MINI ICE AGEIt is a date that coincides pretty well with the culmination of a mini ice age,or prolonged cold spell, known as the Younger Dryas. This had enveloped much ofthe Northern Hemisphere for around thirteen hundred hundred years, ca.10,900–9600 BC, bringing with it a pronounced dip in temperature as well as asustained drought that severely altered the plant and animal life throughoutwhat is known as the Fertile Crescent. This is the arclike region of verdantriver valleys, steppes, and plains that stretches clockwise from Palestine andIsrael, through the Levantine corridor of Lebanon, into the Middle EuphratesBasin of northern Syria, then across into what is known as Northern Mesopotamia,a region that embraces southeast Anatolia, before entering the MesopotamianPlain, or what is today the country of Iraq.The Younger Dryas period followed a two-thousand-year episode of global warmingknown as the Allerød interstadial. This in turn had brought to a close the lastice age proper, which had been with us for approximately ninety-five thousandyears, reaching its last glacial maximum around twenty to twenty-two thousandyears ago (an interstadial is a period when temperatures rise and glaciers go onthe retreat).With the cessation of the mini ice age, or big chill, ca. 9600 BC, thetemperatures rose, bringing about a blossoming of new flora and fauna (ingeological terms this point in history marks the transition from the Pleistoceneage to the Holocene, which we are still in today). It was an ideal environmentfor new growth that led to the emergence of agriculture on the Middle Euphratesand farther south within the Levantine corridor. It was also around this time,Schmidt believes, that hunter-gatherers from across the region came together tocreate the extraordinary stone structures being uncovered today at Göbekli Tepe,which he is sure were not domestic in nature.No evidence of fires, hearths, cooking areas, or any other signs of habitationhave been found in or around the enclosures at Göbekli Tepe that might indicatethe permanent presence here of a large community. Human remains have been found,plenty of them, although these are either retrieved from the fill covering theenclosures or are found concealed in walls or benches. Exactly what they aredoing here remains unclear.A LIFE OF BEEROne more anomaly at Göbekli Tepe is that the nearest water source is 3 miles (5kilometers) away, meaning that any drinking water has to be carried to the site.This lack of a constant water supply seems illogical, especially given that theconstruction of the monuments would have required the presence of a labor forceinvolving hundreds of workers and their families, all of whom would have neededto be fed on a daily basis. The only explanation is that the workers lived insettlements nearby and climbed the mountain with sufficient supplies to lastthem for the duration of their stay.This said, there is a strong possibility that a form of beer made from wildwheat was on the menu at Göbekli Tepe. Large stone vats unearthed by Schmidt’steam have been linked with beer production (see figure 2.3).9[index_split_058.html#filepos926164] Whether the beer was brewed for reasons ofnecessity or for some ritual function remains to be seen, although as anintoxicating beverage it is likely to have possessed an otherworldlysignificance. The term ale, used today for beer, originally meant any kind ofalcoholic drink made using wheat grain. The word could well derive from theIndo-European root alu, which has definite connotations of shifting realitiesand altered states of consciousness through its presence in key words such ashallucinate and hallucination.10 [index_split_058.html#filepos926297]CUP MARKS FOR CARRION BIRDSAnother peculiar mystery at Göbekli Tepe is the presence on the exposed bedrockto the southwest of the main enclosures of large cuplike holes, up to 6 inches(15 centimeters) in width and depth (see figure 2.4). There are dozens of themeverywhere. Similar cup marks are to be seen on top of some of the standingpillars, while clusters of them are found also at other Pre-Pottery Neolithicsites across the region.On asking Klaus Schmidt what he thought these cup marks represented in September2012, he shrugged his shoulders and said they are found everywhere, often in thecompany of carved rings marks, like those in Britain. Yet clearly they did oncehave a function, and the most obvious solution is that they were receptacles forsomething, either liquid—blood, beer, milk, or water perhaps—or, more likely,some type of food such as meat. Because they almost always seem to be carved inelevated positions, it appears possible that whatever they contained wereofferings to carrion birds such as vultures, crows, or ravens, which might wellhave played some kind of symbolic function in the rituals taking place insidethe sanctuaries (a large number of bones belonging to both the crow and ravenhave been found within the fill at Göbekli Tepe11[index_split_058.html#filepos926643]).[images/00061.jpg]Figure 2.3. Minor enclosure at Göbekli Tepe, dating to ca. 8500–8000 BC, showinga stone container thought to have held beer.[images/00078.jpg]Figure 2.4. Examples of the incised cup marks found on exposed bedrock in thevicinity of Göbekli Tepe’s Enclosure E.Scavenger birds such as vultures play an important role in the Neolithic cult ofthe dead (see chapter 9), and so gaining their favor in a divinatory mannermight well have been important to the success of a ritual. In other words, ifthe birds came down and took away the meat, it was a good omen, and if theydidn’t, then the opposite would be the case.Interestingly enough, divination has been proposed as an explanation for thepresence of similar cup marks found on exposed rock surfaces in the area ofMount Ararat in eastern Anatolia. Armenian prehistorians speculate that althoughthe true purpose of the cup marks has now been lost, they were probably “used byoracles during fortune telling,” a very credible explanation indeed, which sitswell with their possible function at Göbekli Tepe.12[index_split_058.html#filepos926861]ENGINEERING CONUNDRUMThe standing pillars found in the various enclosures at Göbekli Tepe areregularly between 6.5 and 10 feet (2 and 3 meters) in size and are thought toweigh between 5.5 and 16.5 U.S. tons apiece (5 and 15 metric tonnes). Even moreof an enigma is that sitting in a quarry a quarter of a mile (400 meters) awayfrom the occupational mound is an unfinished T-shaped monolith some 22.9 feet (7meters) in length and 9.8 feet (3 meters) broad, with an estimated weight ofapproximately 55 U.S. tons (50 metric tonnes).13[index_split_058.html#filepos927014] As Schmidt asked back in 2001:> How could the manpower be amassed at the mound to move such pillars? It seems> obvious that only organized meetings of several groups of hunter-gatherers> from the territories around Göbekli Tepe would be able to provide the> capabilities for such an undertaking, meetings rooted in a ritual> background.14 [index_split_058.html#filepos927164]As Schmidt admits, the construction of huge megalithic architecture is notthought to have begun until many thousand years later at places such as Egyptand Stonehenge in England. Never before had the archaeological communityconceived of such feats of monumental engineering going on even before thewide-scale appearance of agriculture. From the faunal (animal) remains retrievedfrom the fill covering Göbekli Tepe’s occupational mound, it would seem that themain food source was wild game such as gazelles, red deer, wild boar, aurochs,and wild sheep,15 [index_split_058.html#filepos927265] supplemented with copiousamounts of almonds and pistachios.NEOLITHIC REVOLUTIONIn Schmidt’s opinion: “Hunter-gatherers living at Göbekli Tepe for an extendedtime would have caused a serious over-exploitation of the local naturalresources.”16 [index_split_058.html#filepos927428] For him the coming togetherof so many people led to the domestication of wild species of cereals and otherplants in order to feed those present both here and at other similar sitesacross southeast Anatolia, causing what Australian archaeologist and philologistV. Gordon Childe (1892–1957) long ago christened the Neolithic revolution.Yet Childe saw it the other way around—the rapid spread of agriculture at thebeginning of the Neolithic, and the more settled lifestyle it brought withit—gave people time to invent new technologies and to think about the mysteriesof life, leading to the construction of the first temples, an act that led tothe creation of cities and civilizations. Now we know Childe was wrong. It wasthe temples that came first, with agriculture created in their wake to satisfythe needs of so many people engaged in the construction and maintenance of suchmammoth building projects.THE ORIGINS OF AGRICULTURESuch a theory makes sense of another puzzling enigma that prehistorians arestill trying to fully understand. Genetic research into the origins of cerealproduction has determined that no less than sixty-eight modern strains of wheat,used by us today to make bread, beer, pasta, and other products, can be tracedback to a variety of wild einkorn that grows on the slopes of Karaca Dağ(pronounced ka-rag-a dar), a volcanic mountain just 50 miles (80 kilometers)northeast of Göbekli Tepe.17 [index_split_058.html#filepos927578] This meansthat wheat might well have been domesticated for the first time only a shortdistance away from the site of humanity’s earliest known example of monumentalarchitecture.Over an extensive period of time einkorn was gradually domesticated throughselective cultivation to create a much stronger variety whereby the kernelsremained on the plants, instead of falling to the ground. This enabled a higherwheat yield through the heads being able to ripen better before harvesting tookplace.Was it possible that the domestication of wheat occurred in southeast Anatoliain response to the sheer need to feed so many groups of hunter-gatherers eitherlaboring away on site or visiting Göbekli Tepe as part of some huge sociomagicalgathering? “Their idea, to meet again and again at a specific place,” Schmidtargues, “seems to be a basic factor of the origins of neolithization.”18[index_split_058.html#filepos927798] Here then, really, is where the revolutionbegan—the revolution in becoming Neolithic, in becoming farmers tilling thefields, herding animals, and living more communal lifestyles. It was a turningpoint in human existence that quite literally paved the way for the rise ofcivilization, which had its beginnings in what was happening at Göbekli Tepesome 11,500 years ago."},{"pageContent":"3FROZEN IN STONEA large number of the T-shaped pillars seen in the various enclosures at GöbekliTepe show beautiful carvings of strange, eerie, and often terrifying creaturesof the natural world. Those most frequently represented are, in order, snakes,leaping foxes, wild boars, and cranes. Others seen include aurochs, gazelles,lions, wild sheep, lizards, scorpions, spiders, and ants (with at least one bearand a hyena identified as well). Various species of bird are also found,including flamingos, vultures, ibises, and flightless birds. In addition tothis, excavators have found a number of 3-D statues that include boars, aurochs,and at least three teeth-bearing predators, most likely wolves. These can beseen today in Şanlıurfa’s museum of archaeology.Too many species are represented by the carved art to easily assess what exactlythey all mean or why there are so many creatures portrayed together, and perhapsthis is a clue to their greater purpose. It is almost as if they constitute asnapshot of the abundance of life that existed when the monuments wereconstructed shortly after the end of the last Ice Age. Yet for the most partthese are not friendly creatures by any stretch of the imagination: they bite,gore, claw, sting, tear apart, and generally kill whatever gets in their way.They are not the kind of animals you would want to be locked inside aclaustrophobic room with, without any means of escape.None of the animals shown on the stone pillars at Göbekli Tepe are nice cuddlycreatures, even though some of them, such as the auroch, wild boar, wild sheep,and even the wolf, would afterward become domesticated. Clearly, this was meantto be the case, suggesting that someone, an entrant or initiate, finding him- orherself inside an enclosure, would immediately be presented with a terrifyingvisual spectacle illuminated either by natural light or by torches of some kind.It was an assault on the senses that would have induced not a state of peace andcalmness, but one of fear and alertness, something that must have been all toofamiliar to the hunter-gatherer, whose whole life was centered around thestruggle for survival on a day-to-day basis.Yet such mental assaults were perhaps not simply for focusing the mind on thedangers of the hunt, especially as by this time people were beginning to settleinto more communal lifestyles away from the immediate concerns of the chase.There was clearly something else going on here, something that plunges us intothe realm of deep-seated, instinctual psychological states.For example, when we look at the magnificent accomplishment of the Paleolithicartists that entered the deepest caves of northern Spain and southern France toexecute their work toward the end of the last ice age, ca. 30,000–9500 BC, asense of immense beauty and tranquility is conveyed. This is in completecontrast to the overall sense of fear and anxiety that exudes from the morechilling art of Göbekli Tepe. This, simply from its manner of execution, hasmore in common with the visual art of the pre-Columbian civilizations of Centraland South America than it does the majestic cave paintings of southwest Europe.It is an impression that only deepens the more we examine the various enclosuresat Göbekli Tepe.ENCLOSURE COf all the structures so far uncovered at Göbekli Tepe, by far the most complexis Enclosure C, which, like Enclosure B, is ovoid in appearance, being roughly75 feet (23 meters) by 60 feet (18 meters) in size. It consists of twoconcentric walls of stone (the inner one being built after the structure’soriginal construction1 [index_split_058.html#filepos928021]), each containingvarious pillars, most of them T-shaped.At the center of the enclosure two enormous twin monoliths once stood. Onlytheir stumps remain in situ, with a large fragment of the western monolith(Pillar 37) being reerected in 2009 under the leadership of German architect andengineering consultant Eduard Knoll. Similar to the central pillars in EnclosureB, a leaping fox appears on its inner face, the animal’s gaze once againdirected southward. Estimates suggest that originally Enclosure C’s twin pillarswould have stood around 16 feet (5 meters) in height. Yet unlike those ofEnclosure B, these examples have not been set within a terrazzo floor. Instead,they are slotted into rectangular grooves cut into raised, steplike pedestalssculpted out of the bedrock.A large area of smoothed bedrock, elliptical in shape, complete with a pair ofrock-cut pedestals that also contain rectangular slots, had earlier been foundon level ground 160 yards (146 meters) west-southwest of Göbekli Tepe’s maingroup of structures. Yet here, in what has become known as Enclosure E, or theFelsentempel (German for “rock temple”), no clear evidence of any standingpillars or surrounding structure survives today. This said, it is clear thatEnclosure E is of the same general age as Enclosure C.Adjacent to Enclosure C’s western central monolith is one of the most remarkableT-shaped stones discovered so far at the site. Running down the front narrowedge of Pillar 27 is a 3-D predator, a famished quadruped, with a long bushytail and emaciated body. Its snarling jaws, complete with carved linessignifying whiskers, reveal a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth. That such a featof artistic expression was carried out eleven thousand years ago by simplehunter-gatherers seems almost alien, although achieve it they did. As to theidentity of this predator, Schmidt believes it is a feline, a lion mostprobably. Yet the shape of its body, the large incised teeth, and the long bushytail make a case for its being a canine of some description.A DOUBLE RING OF STONESThe exact number of standing pillars Enclosure C’s outer ring once possessed isnow lost, with just eight remaining in place. Its inner ring probably containedtwelve T-shaped pillars, with eleven surviving today. The area between the twoconcentric walls into which the stones were set created a circular walkway,although there was no direct means of access from here into the centralenclosure where the twin monoliths were located. So how might entry have beenachieved? The answer is that either a porthole stone once existed within thewall of the inner ring (several such stones, some decorated with carved figures,have been found at the site), or the entrant had to quite literally climbinside, perhaps using ropes or a ladder. This is suggested by the presence of asteplike feature on the south side of the enclosure between two pillars, formingwhat appears to be an entranceway of some kind (see plate 7[index_split_031.html#filepos428543]).Another possibility is that there was once an overhead entry point within acovered roof. Certainly, there are angled slots and grooves on the uppersurfaces of some of the stones making up Enclosure C’s inner circle, which couldeasily have been cut to help support an overhead structure. Yet whether a roofof this sort was an original feature or one added at some later point remainsunclear. Archaeologist Ted Banning of the University of Toronto has proposedthat the T-shaped pillars at Göbekli Tepe were primarily roof supports and theenclosures themselves domestic houses,2 [index_split_058.html#filepos928156] aview not shared by Schmidt and his colleagues.THE DROMOSEnclosure C’s circular walkway, between the outer and inner temenos walls, wasentered from the south through a north-south-aligned stone passage measuring 25feet (7.5 meters) in length. Schmidt calls it the dromos, after an ancient Greekword meaning avenue or entranceway, because of its likeness to the passagewaysattached to the beehive-shaped tholoi tombs of Mycenaean Greece.At the southern end of the dromos a curious U-shaped stone portal, or inversearch, was set up as an entranceway. The upright terminations of its two “arms”were carved into the likeness of strange, crouching quadrupeds that faceoutward; that is, away from each other. The identity of these twin guardians,only one of which remains roughly in situ today, is another puzzle (see plate 8[index_split_031.html#filepos428918]). Schmidt calls this U-shaped doorway the“Lion’s Gate,”3 [index_split_058.html#filepos928292] perhaps because of the twinlions carved in stone above the Lion’s Gate entrance at the Mycenaean city ofMycenae in southern Greece.Beyond the U-shaped entrance to the dromos, Schmidt’s team has uncovered a stonestairway of eight steps constructed to navigate a noticeable dip or “depression”in the bedrock (see figure 3.1).4 [index_split_058.html#filepos928422] It is anincredible feat of ingenuity and constitutes one of the oldest staircases to befound anywhere in the world. Its presence here at Göbekli Tepe confirms boththat an ascent was required to enter the enclosure and that the south was thedirection of approach for the visitor.[images/00090.jpg]Figure 3.1. Plan of Göbekli Tepe showing the main enclosures uncovered so far.ENCLOSURE DAbutting Enclosure C to the northwest is Enclosure D, the most accomplished ofall the structures at Göbekli Tepe. Once again it is ovoid, measuringapproximately 60 feet (18 meters) by 47.5 feet (14.5 meters), and wouldoriginally have contained a ring of twelve T-shaped pillars (just eleven remaintoday). Its length-to-breath ratio is almost exactly 5:4, which, strangelyenough, is identical to that of Enclosure B and Enclosure C, something that isunlikely to be coincidence. (The ovoid outline in the bedrock of the nowvanished Enclosure E, located slightly west of the main group of structures,suggests that it too possessed a 5:4 size ratio.) It is a realization we returnto in chapter 5.Two enormous twin monoliths stand at the center of Enclosure D. Althoughslightly bent by the weight of the soil and debris bearing down on them, theyremain intact today. Each one—with a height of around 18 feet (5.5 meters) andweighing as much as 16.5 U.S. tons apiece (15 metric tonnes)—was found to havebeen slotted into rectangular pedestals carved out of the bedrock, like those inEnclosure C. Yet bizarrely these slots are no more than 4–6 inches (10–15centimeters) deep, which would have left the pillars particularly unstable.Such a decision to erect the pillars in this manner is unlikely to have been adesign fault, as it seems so out of character with the sophisticated style ofbuilding construction employed at Göbekli Tepe. The only logical explanation isto assume that in addition to being slotted firmly into the bedrock pedestals,the central pillars were held in place by wooden support frames (as they aretoday), which perhaps formed part of a roof.MYSTERY OF THE FLIGHTLESS BIRDSThe carved decoration on Enclosure D’s eastern central pillar (Pillar 18) isquite extraordinary. Starting with the rock-cut pedestal supporting themonolith, we see a line of seven strange birds spread out along its south-facingedge (see plate 16 [index_split_031.html#filepos432158]). The peculiar shape oftheir heads and beaks give them the appearance of baby dinosaurs! However, thecreatures’ plump bodies, without any obvious wings, reveal them to be flightlessbirds that sit on their haunches, their legs stretched out in front of them. Sowhat species do they represent? An examination of known flightless birds fromthe past right down to the present day suggests they could be dodos (see figure3.2).*1 [index_split_057.html#filepos911799]No other bird type known to have existed in the tenth millennium BC even comesclose to matching what we see at Göbekli Tepe, and to ignore this conclusionwould be to miss an opportunity to better understand the geographical world ofthe Göbekli builders. This is not to say they visited the island of Mauritius inthe Indian Ocean, where the dodo was hunted to extinction by the first Europeansto reach the island, only that somewhere on their travels the Göbekli buildersmight have encountered a similar bird that is today extinct.As to why birds of this type are represented at Göbekli Tepe we can onlyspeculate. Perhaps the fact that they are flightless is the clue. Since theycan’t fly away, they are rooted to the ground, just like the bedrock pedestalson which they’re carved, implying therefore that the birds symbolize permanenceand a point of foundation.[images/00076.jpg]Figure 3.2. Left, seated dodo bird and, right, two of the seven flightless birdsseen on the pedestal of Göbekli Tepe’s Pillar 18 in Enclosure D.LATER PHASES OF BUILDING ACTIVITYVarious smaller enclosures and cell-like rooms, uncovered to the north and westof the main group of buildings at Göbekli Tepe, were found to have beenconstructed during a slightly later building phase, ca. 9000–8000 BC. This seemscertain, since they are positioned as much as 50 feet (15 meters) higher thanthe other enclosures constructed on the bedrock below. In other words, thesemuch younger structures were built long after the older structures had beenburied (at least in part) below the gradually emerging tell. Like theirforerunners, these rooms contain T-shaped pillars, communal benches, andstone-lined walls, invariably rectangular in design. Yet in size and qualitythey are often greatly inferior. In some cases, they are the size of bathrooms,with their stones no more than 3.2 to 5 feet (1 to 1.5 meters) in height. Someof the pillars are T-shaped, with clearly carved anthropomorphic features liketheir predecessors, while others are left unadorned. Clearly the later Göbeklibuilders were downsizing in architectural style and artistic design, while atthe same time retaining some elements of the earlier enclosures.Around 8000 BC the remaining structures at Göbekli Tepe were covered with filland abandoned completely, this unique style of architecture continuing only at ahandful of other Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites in the region, including Çayönü andNevalı Çori, which we have already explored; Hamzan Tepe,5[index_split_058.html#filepos928595] Sefer Tepe,6[index_split_058.html#filepos928830] and Taşlı Tepe,7[index_split_058.html#filepos928959] all near Şanlıurfa; and Karahan Tepe.8[index_split_058.html#filepos929176] This last mentioned site, set within theTektek Mountains some 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of Şanlıurfa, has yet to befully excavated, even though in size it could easily match that of Göbekli Tepe(it was investigated by the present author in 2004, who noted carved stonefragments, exposed heads of T-shaped pillars, a stone row, and countless flinttools scattered across a very wide area indeed). At a place named Kilisik, closeto the town of Adıyaman, around 53 miles (85 kilometers) north of Nevalı Çori, amini T-shaped figure in the form of a small stone statue was found in 1965,9[index_split_058.html#filepos929339] leading prehistorians to consider thatanother early Neolithic site awaits discovery here (see chapter 10 for more onthis remarkable statue). At a place named Kilisik, a village close to the Kahtariver in Adıyaman province, in the foothills of the Anti-Taurus Mountains, some46.5 miles (75 kilometers) north-northwest of Göbekli Tepe, a mini T-shapedfigure in the form of a small stone statue was found in 1965,9 leadingprehistorians to consider that another early Neolithic site awaits discoveryhere (see chapter 10 for more on this remarkable stature).TRIANGLE D’ORAll of these sites, where T-shaped pillars and portable statues have been found,lie within a very small area no more than 150 miles (240 kilometers) indiameter, with its center close to Karaca Dağ, where the genetic origins ofmodern wheat have been traced to a variety of wild einkorn growing on its lowerslopes. This area of southeast Anatolia, where neolithization began, has beenchristened the triangle d’or, the “golden triangle,” due to the key role itplayed in kick-starting the Neolithic revolution.10[index_split_058.html#filepos929554]It is a grand title, the triangle d’or, but it does seem to express the sheergenius of inspiration that led to the emergence of sites such as Göbekli Tepe,with their unique architecture, which seems almost alien to the modern world.Yet where did this genius of inspiration come from? Dr. Mehrdad R. Izady,professor of Near East studies at New York University, wrote in 1992 (two yearsbefore Klaus Schmidt first visited Göbekli Tepe) that at the beginning of theNeolithic age the peoples of southeast Anatolia “went through an unexplainedstage of accelerated technological evolution, prompted by yet uncertainforces.”11 [index_split_058.html#filepos929758] What exactly were these as “yetuncertain forces”? Were they material or divine? Were they human or somethingelse altogether? All we can say is that something quite extraordinary happenedin the triangle d’or some twelve thousand years ago, and the key tounderstanding this mystery might well await discovery among the T-shaped pillarsand carved art of Göbekli Tepe.To date, seven major structures (Enclosures A, B, C, D, E, and F, as well as theLion Pillar Building) have been explored at Göbekli Tepe. Yet the geomagneticsurvey undertaken in 2003 suggests that this constitutes just a small fractionof what lies buried beneath the occupational mound (Schmidt estimates theremight be as many as fifteen more enclosures still to be uncovered, providing atotal of some 200 standing pillars12 [index_split_058.html#filepos929882]). Ascan be imagined, with two digging campaigns a year (April to May and Septemberto November), Klaus Schmidt’s multinational team is constantly discovering newstructures and monuments.Very gradually our fragmented picture of what went on here as much as twelvethousand years ago will slowly take shape. Trying to unravel its mysteries toosoon is rife with problems, although simply stepping aside and allowing thearchaeological evidence to speak for itself is to miss an opportunity to getinside the minds of the Göbekli builders and truly know what motivated them togive up their hunter-gatherer lifestyle to create monumental architecture on ascale never before seen in the world. Why exactly did they do this? Why createthe earliest known megalithic monuments anywhere in the world? One possible clueis the strange carved symbolism on the stones that includes quite specificglyphs or ideograms, which, as we see next, might well reveal the Göbeklibuilders’ fascination with the heavens."},{"pageContent":"4STRANGE GLYPHS AND IDEOGRAMSThe eastern central pillar (Pillar 18) in Göbekli Tepe’s Enclosure D sports awide belt on which are a sequence of abstract glyphs, or ideograms, which arelikely to have had some symbolic meaning to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic world ofthe tenth millennium BC. One, looking like a thin letter C, is seen sometimesturned toward the left and at other times toward the right. Another glyph,resembling the letter H, is found both in an upright position and rotated 90degrees (see figure 4.1 and plate 11 [index_split_031.html#filepos430298] andplate13 [index_split_031.html#filepos431039]). It appears in the same sequenceas the C-shaped glyphs, and both seem to work in concert with each other.On the “front” of the T-shape’s belt the H symbol appears no less than fivetimes, two upright and three on their side. In addition to these glyphs isanother, slightly larger ideogram that appears in the position of the figure’sbelt buckle, below which a fox-pelt loincloth appears in high relief (both areexplored in chapter 12).THE H GLYPHHow might we interpret these strange ideograms in use among the Göbekli buildersso soon after the end of the last Ice Age? Let’s start with the H glyph.Searching the archives of prehistoric symbolism throws up very little. Theycould be shields made of animal hide, as examples in prehistoric art dooccasionally resemble the letter H. Yet if so, why do they appear so many timeson the same pillar? Also apparent is that the H character resembles two letterTs joined stem to stem. It is an association that might not be without meaning,especially in view of the general appearance of the T-shaped pillars at GöbekliTepe and the presence of the twin monoliths at the center of the enclosures. Ifso, then what might this mirrored double T actually represent?[images/00079.jpg]Figure 4.1. Mid-section of Göbekli Tepe’s Pillar 18 in Enclosure D showing thefigure’s wide belt decorated with C- and H-shaped glyphs.Is it possible that the H glyph conveys the connection between two perfectlymirrored worlds, states, or existences linked by a conceived bridge or tunnel,represented by the crossbar between the two “columns”? If this is the case, itreally does not matter whether the glyph is depicted upright or rotated 90degrees; the meaning would always be the same.SHAMANIC POT STANDSSome idea of how indigenous cultures have portrayed the relationship between thetwo worlds, and the transition between the two, can be found in the design ofritual pot stands used by the Desana shamans of Colombia. Taking the shape of anhourglass, that is, two cones point to point, they are made from spiraling canesbound together in such a manner as to leave a central hole connecting the twocones, which, when looked at from either end, have the appearance of a hole-likeentrance through a spiraling vortex or whirlpool (see figure 4.2). Yet “whenseen in profile, as an hourglass, the object can be interpreted as a cosmicmodel, the two cones connected by a circular ‘door’, an image that leads toothers such as ‘birth’, ‘rebirth’, the passage from one ‘dimension’ (turí) toanother while under the influence of a narcotic, and to similar shamanisticimages. . . . In sum, the hourglass shape contains a great amount of shamanisticimagery concerned with cosmic structures and with transformative processes.”1[index_split_058.html#filepos930099]These are the words of anthropologist Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff (1912–1994), whoconducted an extensive study of the beliefs and practices of shamanic-basedcultures of the Amazon rainforest. He saw the hourglass-shaped pot stand of theDesana as symbolic of the connection between the two worlds, the hole createdbetween the two cones being the point of entrance and exit between the twodimensions of existence. This bears out the interpretation of Göbekli Tepe’s Hglyph as being a mirrored symbol of movement between two worlds, whether acrossspace or time. If so, then it is likely that the accompanying C glyph also hassome kind of transformative role. It would not be unreasonable to see the twin Cshape as the slim crescents of the old and new moon, which when shown together,face to face, signify the transition period between one lunar cycle and thenext.[images/00123.jpg]Figure 4.2. Desana shaman’s ritual pot stand from the side and looking downthrough its hollow interior (after Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff).AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL ARTAnother possible interpretation of the C-shaped glyph can be found among thesymbolic art of the aboriginal peoples of Australia. Here the C-shape ideogramdepicts a bird’s-eye view of a seated man or woman, the arms of the symbolrepresenting those of the individual.2 [index_split_058.html#filepos930246] Whentwo Cs are shown together, face to face, this denotes two people sittingopposite each other.3 [index_split_058.html#filepos930423] Occasionally therewill be a bar shown between them, signifying a small, benchlike moundconstructed for special ceremonies and said to symbolize a mound of creationassociated with a primeval snake.4 [index_split_058.html#filepos930523]A photograph in British anthropologist Sir Walter Baldwin Spencer’s book AcrossAustralia (1912) of a Worgaia medicine man from Central Australia, who washimself “a great maker of medicine men,”5 [index_split_058.html#filepos930668]shows the double C ideogram, with a bar in between, painted on his chest. It isnearly identical to one that appears on the chest of a T-shaped pillar atGöbekli Tepe (see figure 4.3 on p. 54),6 [index_split_058.html#filepos930774]the only difference being that here the horizontal line forms the connecting barof the H symbol earlier described.EMBLEMS OF OFFICELike other major pillars at Göbekli Tepe, Enclosure D’s central monoliths havecarved symbols upon their “neck,” just below their T-shaped heads. On theeastern pillar two are seen, the uppermost being the same H-shaped glyph foundon the belt. This particular example is upright with a small, hollowed-out ovalshape within its crossbar (here the symbol looks like two matchstick men holdinghands, which lends credence to the idea that the C-ideogram might sometimes meana seated man or woman, just as it does in Australian aboriginal art).Immediately beneath the H shape is a well-defined, horizontal crescent, itshorns turned upward. Cupped within its concave form is a wide-banded circle witha deeply incised hole at its center. A thin, V-shaped “collar” or “chain” isvisible either side of the two glyphs (see figure 4.4 on p. 56), making it clearthat these symbols are emblems of office worn around the neck, perhaps denotingthe individual’s status or identity.[images/00129.jpg]Figure 4.3. Left, double C and H symbol on the chest of Pillar 28 in GöbekliTepe’s Enclosure C. Right, Worgaia medicine man from Central Australia with thesame symbol on his body.Confirming the use of collars or chains by the elite of the Pre-PotteryNeolithic is a life-size statue of a man, 5 feet 9 inches (1.8 meters) inheight, found at Şanlıurfa, just 8 miles (13 kilometers) from Göbekli Tepe (seeplate 23 [index_split_031.html#filepos435017]). Located today in the city’sarchaeological museum, the figure was discovered in 1993 on Yeni Yol Street inBalıklıgöl, the oldest part of the city, where a Pre-Pottery Neolithic Asettlement was investigated in 1997.7 [index_split_058.html#filepos930899] It ishere also in Balıklıgöl that the prophet Abraham is said to have been bornwithin a cave shrine renowned throughout the Muslim world as an important placeof pilgrimage. The statue, which has black obsidian disks for eyes, a prominentnose, arms that end in hands clasped over the genitalia, and a conelike lowerhalf where the legs should be, dates to around 9000 BC. The fact that it alsosports a double V-shaped collar in high relief is evidence that the neck emblemson the T-shaped pillars at Göbekli Tepe are most likely pendants or medallionsattached to a chain or collar of office.THE EYE AND THE CRESCENTAlthough it is conceivable that the crescent on the neck of the eastern centralpillar in Enclosure D signifies the moon, the carved circle with the hole in itscenter is more difficult to understand (see figure 4.4 on p. 56). Perhaps it isa representation of an eye, as similar circles with hollow middles act as eyeson the 3-D carving of the snarling predator seen on the front face of EnclosureC’s Pillar 27. The likeness is too close for this to be simply coincidence. Soif the circle is an eye, then the slim crescent that cups it must form the lowereyelid.In ancient Egypt the eye was the symbol of the sun god Re (or Ra), while thetitle Eye of Re was given to various leonine goddesses including Sekhmet,Tefnut, and Bastet, showing the clear relationship between the sun and theall-seeing eye.THE WESTERN CENTRAL PILLAREnclosure D’s other central pillar (Pillar 31), positioned to the west of theone just described, also sports a belt and buckle, although in this instanceboth are almost featureless (other than a small bovine scratched into the belton its eastern side). Like its neighbor, the T-shape sports a fox-peltloincloth, while around its “neck” is a small bucranium, or ox head, worn as apendant or emblem of office. French prehistorian Jacques Cauvin saw the bull inearly Neolithic symbolism as representative of male domination over nature.8[index_split_058.html#filepos931082] This might well be so. Yet if the combinedcircle and crescent symbol on the neck of the eastern pillar does represent thesun, then there has to be a distinct possibility that the bucranium on itswestern neighbor represents the moon, the twin pillars displaying some kind ofdual, solar-lunar polarity.[images/00001.jpg]Figure 4.4. H, eye, and crescent symbol together on the neck of the easterncentral pillar (Pillar 18) in Göbekli Tepe’s Enclosure D.That bucrania perhaps symbolized the crescent moon in the Upper Paleolithic isshown by the Venus of Laussel, a carved stone relief of a naked full-bodiedwoman, 17.5 inches (45 centimeters) in height and carved into a block oflimestone. Dating to ca. 27,000–20,000 BC, she was discovered in 1911 at theentrance to a rock shelter at Laussel in the Dordogne region of southwesternFrance. In her right hand she holds a bison’s horn on which are inscribedthirteen vertical notches, interpreted by some prehistorians as symbolizing thethirteen-month lunar cycle.Should these speculations prove valid, it implies that some of the glyphsdisplayed on the T-shaped pillars at Göbekli Tepe have distinct spatial,temporal, and celestial values. The C and H ideograms, along with the eye symboland bucranium, all suggest as much. So are the anthropomorphic pillarspersonifications of higher intelligences—some kind of divine company thatreflects these otherworldly influences? We now begin to explore the truefunction of Göbekli Tepe’s quite extraordinary monumental architecture."},{"pageContent":"PART TWOCosmos[images/00125.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"5GATEWAY TO HEAVENIt is impossible today to assess the exact number of stones in each of the mainenclosures uncovered at Göbekli Tepe. There were certainly twelve stones inEnclosure D’s main circle. Eight remain in Enclosure C’s outer wall and elevenwithin its inner ring, with the likelihood of a twelfth having once existed.Seven are known from Enclosure B (not counting the two central pillars), whileEnclosure A is so different in style that guessing its original design becomesdifficult. Enclosure F is so small, and from such a later date, that it isunlikely to have been built with the exact same motivations as its predecessors;ditto the Lion Pillar Building on the summit of the mound.Having said this, it does appear that a twelvefold division of stones did onceexist in Enclosures C and D, arguably Göbekli Tepe’s oldest and mostaccomplished structures uncovered so far, while twelve T-shaped pillars areknown to have existed in the walls of Nevalı Çori’s Level II cult building, thenumber increasing to thirteen during its next building phase, Level III, ca.8000 BC. (The level system runs from the oldest layer, Level I, ca. 8500 BC, tothe most recent occupational layers, Levels III–V, ca. 8000–7600 BC.)That the earliest enclosures at Göbekli Tepe might originally have had twelveT-shaped pillars within their elliptical walls raises the question of whetherthis number had any significance to the hunter-gatherers who created thesestrange structures over eleven thousand years ago. Was it simply by chance thattwelve stones were chosen for the purpose, or might there be some deeper meaningbehind the use of this myth-laden number?A CLOCKWISE MOTIONA clue to this mystery lies in the fact that at least half of the standingpillars in Enclosures C and D have reliefs both on their shafts and on theirT-shaped “heads.” Yet the head decoration appears only on the right-hand “faces”of the figures, never on their left sides.1 [index_split_058.html#filepos931330]If these facial carvings had to be viewed in any kind of order or sequence, thenit implies the entrant would have had to perambulate the enclosures in aclockwise motion. Doing so in a counterclockwise direction would have meant notbeing able to see any of the cranial reliefs.Of course, this could all just be coincidence or a simple case of designpreference on the part of the Göbekli builders. However, a preferred navigationof the sacred enclosures in a clockwise fashion, along with the possiblecelestial nature of the glyphs on key pillars in Enclosures C and D, does hintat some kind of synchronization with the motion of the celestial bodies—the sun,moon, and planets—which all rise in the east and move around to the south beforesetting in the west.This clockwise, or sunwise, movement is seen in the shadow cast by a verticalpole or sundial gnomon. For this reason, the hands of the first analog clockswere set to move “with the sun”; that is, clockwise, and not counterclockwise,or anticlockwise, something that was seen as against the natural order of theuniverse.THE SUN’S PATHThese realizations invoke compelling thoughts. The ecliptic, the sun’s coursethrough the heavens, is divided into twelve divisions, or “months,” a consensusreached long ago based on the placement along its circular course of twelve keyconstellations, which each rise with the sun across one complete calendar year.Each remains visible in this role for a period of around thirty days, or onemonth, before giving way to the next constellation in line, the whole processoccurring twelve times in all before the first constellation returns to thepredawn sky.These zodiacal constellations provide us with a twelvefold division both of thesolar year and the vault of heaven, with the combined twelve 30-degree sectionsmaking up a 360-degree circle. Thus in this manner both time and space areintrinsically bound together in recurring cycles, which through the passage ofthe seasons and the movement of the planets control the destiny of humankind,this being the root of astrology.The problem here is that the creation of the zodiac, along with the twelvefolddivision of the ecliptic and the establishment of the zodiacal houses, isthought to have taken place only around three thousand years ago, with all itsdifferent elements coming together finally in the Greek zodiac, which evolvedinto its current form during the first millennium BC. Despite this, a twelvefolddivision of the heavens did exist before this time. For example, as early as2400 BC the Indus Valley civilization divided the celestial horizon into twelveparts.2 [index_split_058.html#filepos931477] Excavations at Lothal in Indiabetween 1955 and 1960 revealed knowledge among the inhabitants of an eight- andtwelvefold division of the horizon and sky. They utilized a thick, ringlikeinstrument made of shell, which divided the horizon into 360 degrees—all thiscoming some fifteen hundred years before the Greeks “invented” the zodiac.3[index_split_058.html#filepos931936]COSMIC HARMONYThe twelvefold division of the enclosures at Göbekli Tepe suggests a basicknowledge of cosmic geography in the design and layout of its monumentalarchitecture. If correct, then the apparent 5:4 size ratio of Enclosures B, C,D, and E, which are all ovoid, suggests not only a basic understanding of cosmicharmony and proportion but also an interest in the interaction between differenttime cycles, most obviously those relating to the earth’s eccentricity, itsaxial tilt, and the precession of the earth’s orbit against the starrybackground (see chapter 7 for more on the Göbekli builders’ apparent interest inprecession). Although many of these cosmic notions were not fully recognizeduntil fairly recent times, there is some hint that they were known at least inprinciple during the age of Pythagoras and Plato.4[index_split_058.html#filepos932059]So the next most obvious question would be to ask whether the carved art atGöbekli Tepe confirms its builders’ interest in a twelvefold division of thenight sky. The answer, unfortunately, is frustratingly disappointing, foralthough certain zoomorphs found carved on the T-shape pillars do resemble thesigns of the zodiac (such as scorpions, rams, goats, bulls, birds, and lions),there are too many other creatures featured to make any realistic comparisonswith existing zodiac forms.Despite such drawbacks, some kind of astronomical or celestial motivation behindthe construction of the various enclosures at Göbekli Tepe cannot be ruled out.If this is the case, then the T-shaped pillars found within the walls of itssacred enclosures might well act as symbolic markers representing the twelvefoldsegmentation of the heavens and the twelvefold division of the year. Yet whatdoes this tell us about the true function of these monuments?CENTER OF THE WORLDWith the rings of T-shaped stones acting as the divisional markers of a symbolicclock face, the main enclosures’ pivotal axis would have been their twin centralpillars. In cosmological terms these constitute the site’s axis mundi, or “axisof the earth,” a concept familiar to shamanic societies worldwide. This was asymbolic axis or world pillar—symbolized usually by a rope, pole, or tree trunkand often associated with a “world mountain” or “cosmic mountain”—seen to linkthe center of the earth with the rotation of the starry canopy via the celestialpole and marked in the night sky by the Pole Star. Each different tribe,culture, or territory had its own axis mundi, while shamanic cultures often hadmovable axis mundi represented by poles erected for this express purpose.Indeed, an axis mundi would often be the pole inside a communal tent, the smokehole at the top of the structure acting as the entrance to a sky world thoughtto exist beyond the physical world.The concept of an axis mundi is most easily understood through its place inGreek cosmological architecture, for here it was marked permanently by anomphalos, a word meaning “navel.” These were bullet-shaped or conical stones ofvarying sizes set up in the inner sanctums of chief sanctuaries to signify thecenter of the physical world (very much like the Shiva-lingam of Hindutradition, a navel-like stone set up in a temple’s most holy place, usually adarkened crypt immediately beneath the main building).According to Greek mythology the site of the original omphalos was determinedwhen the sky god Zeus let fly two eagles, one from either “end” of the earth.Where they came together would be the absolute center of the world, which, inthe version of the story handed down to us, turns out to be Delphi (omphaliexisted in other Greek kingdoms as well). Here the omphalos was said to allowdirect access to the realm of the gods, a fact borne out by its supposedplacement in the temple’s adyton, or Pythia, where a priestess, known as theOracle, would deliver prophecies after breathing vapors rising from a chasm inthe rock.Although the origin of the term omphalos has been lost, it is very likely linkedto the idea that it was connected to the so-called cosmic axis, or turning pointof the heavens, by an invisible umbilical cord. This was a concept based on thebelief that the earth, as the offspring of the greater universe, was nourishedin a fetal state within some kind of cosmic womb, seen in terms of the starryvault of heaven.PLACE OF THE PLACENTAIs it possible that the elliptical shape of the large enclosures at GöbekliTepe, with their 5:4 size ratios, symbolizes the womb chamber, within which isthe ovoid placenta that nourishes a prenatal child during pregnancy via theumbilical cord? Completing the picture would have been the site’s occupationalmound, constructed around the enclosures to represent a belly swollen bypregnancy. It is a theme expressed, of course, in the name Göbekli Tepe, which,as we saw in chapter 1, means in Turkish “navel-like (göbekli) hill (tepe).”There is no way of knowing exactly when Göbekli Tepe gained its current name,although the chances are it replaced an earlier one meaning exactly the samething, a process that might have been going on since the site’s finalabandonment around 8000 BC. Evidence of this comes from the fact that theKurdish name for the tell, which local people see even today as sacred, is GireNavoke, which means “hill (gire) of the swollen belly (navoke),” with anemphasis on fertilization and pregnancy (Armenians, who formerly occupiedeastern Turkey when it was part of Armenia Major, call Göbekli Tepe Portasar,meaning the “hill of the navel.” However, no historical evidence exists to showthat this name was used prior to news of the site’s discovery in the year 2000.)Possibly significant in this respect is that in the language of the Sumerians,who thrived on the Mesopotamia Plain from ca. 2900 BC to 1940 BC, the word forplacenta, ùš, is more or less identical to that used for blood and death (úš),as well as the word for base or foundation place (uš), as in a place to set upthe central pole for a tent.5 [index_split_058.html#filepos932189] Such a termmight easily have applied to Göbekli Tepe, where the “pole” in question wasrepresented by the enclosures’ twin central pillars.In various indigenous cultures and civilizations the placenta was, and still is,considered a very sacred object, the disposal of which was of great importancenot just to the future of the postnatal child, but also to the well-being of thefamily. Among the Acholi tribe of Uganda and the Sudan, for instance, placentasare buried in a spirit house made of stone at the center of a lineage shrineknown as the abila.6 [index_split_058.html#filepos932558] In Eastern Asia, Japanin particular, the placenta is buried with great dignity, often beneath a tree(another symbol of the sky pole). The site is thereafter venerated as a sacredplace, with the placentas of emperors becoming the subject of annual festivalsrelating to the fecundity of the land and the prosperity of the people.7[index_split_058.html#filepos932685]TEMPLE OF THE TWINSPlacentas, when featured in ancient myth and ritual, are often associated withthe theme of twins, a matter that may well have some bearing on the presence ofthe twin pillars at the center of the enclosures at Göbekli Tepe. For example,among the Baganda tribe of Uganda the placenta and umbilical cord of the kingare considered the source of his “twin” (mulongo), which is seen as the ghost orspirit of the placenta.8 [index_split_058.html#filepos932819] During themonarch’s life it is kept under constant watch in a specially built Temple ofthe Twin, and at the first sight of the lunar crescent each month it is broughtinto the king’s presence for a special ceremony. Once the ceremony is complete,the “twin” is “exposed in the doorway of the temple for the moon to shine uponit, and also anointed with butter.”9 [index_split_058.html#filepos932946] Thisexposure to the light of the moon takes place also on a second night, before the“twin” is hidden away for another month.After the king’s death the “twin,” that is, the placenta and umbilical cord, isburied in the temple, along with his jaw, which thereafter functions as a pointof communication with the dead monarch’s spirit, the relics being brought out onspecial occasions for oracular purposes.10 [index_split_058.html#filepos933052]At the same time a new Temple of the Twin is created for the next king, with thewhole process being repeated (rather like the periodic construction of newenclosures at Göbekli Tepe).Even in ancient Egypt the placenta formed the twin of the king, quite literallythe seat of his soul double or alter ego. As in Baganda tradition, it wasretained and carefully protected throughout his life and, following his death,was most probably buried in a special room, where it served as his ka, ordouble. To the ancient Egyptians the royal placenta was seen as a divinity inits own right, its cult attested as early as the late Predynastic period, ca.3250–3050 BC.11 [index_split_058.html#filepos933229]More disturbingly, it is reported that in addition to placing placentas in theabila cult shrine, the Acholi tribe of Africa is said to have buried alive twinsplaced in jars at the same spot.12 [index_split_058.html#filepos933428] Whateverthe reality of this macabre act, it further emphasizes the connection betweentwins and the placenta, which derives in the main from the primordial beliefthat when a child is born, his twin, symbolized by the placenta, is the one whodies, and thus becomes a spirit double of the living person. In this knowledge,it was considered that during pregnancy the womb always contains twins, eachwith his or her own soul and destiny.The association between twins and the placenta is expressed also in the creationmyth of the Dogon of Mali, in West Africa, where a double placenta forms insidethe cosmic egg of Amma, the creator god, each one attached to a pair of twins.13[index_split_058.html#filepos933556] A Dogon pictogram showing the doubleplacenta inside Amma’s egg closely resembles the elliptical appearance of thesanctuaries at Göbekli Tepe (see figure 5.1). More incredibly, vertical strokesdrawn to represent the two sets of twins inside the egg eerily echo theplacement and orientation of the twin pillars at the center of the enclosures.TWIN PORTALS TO THE SKY WORLDThis information makes it highly likely that similar themes might have featuredamong the beliefs and practices of the Göbekli builders. If so, then the twinsets of pillars in the various enclosures at Göbekli Tepe could well signifyhuman twins, either twins that exist in the womb during pregnancy or twins thatare seen to have reentered some kind of symbolic womb in death (something thatevery entrant might have been seen to do when he or she entered the enclosuresfor shamanic purposes). Indeed, if the central pillars do symbolize twins, onerepresenting the human soul, the other signifying the soul double, or ghost,then this practice might be related to a belief expressed by the Karo Batakpeoples of Sumatra, which asserts that of the twin souls, a person’s true soulis that of the placenta, which was probably seen as “the seat of thetransferable soul.”14 [index_split_058.html#filepos933705] In other words, inorder to enter and navigate the spirit world, shamans or initiates had first totransfer the consciousness from their physical body to that of their twin;namely, the placenta soul. Thus the twin central pillars at Göbekli Tepe mighthave enforced a similar belief in the minds of entrants standing between them.[images/00003.jpg]Figure 5.1. Dogon pictogram showing the two sets of twins inside the doubleplacenta within Amma’s egg. Note how the vertical lines, representing the twins,eerily echo the twin central pillars in the enclosures at Göbekli Tepe.Allied to this belief is the fact that the twin pillars at Göbekli Tepe mostprobably signified portals or gateways; that is, entranceways into the conceivedaxis mundi that would have transferred you instantly to the sky world (hollowsin tree trunks are often seen to serve this function among shamanic-basedsocieties). An instantaneous dimension shift of this sort would have beenachieved through the use of one or more shamanic processes, including ecstaticdancing, ritual drumming, long-term sensory deprivation, and, of course, theingestion of psychotropic or soporific substances (something suggested atGöbekli Tepe, as we have seen, through the profusion of snakes in its carved artand also by the presence of large basalt bowls used perhaps in the preparationof drugs and medicine). All of these methods would have enabled the mind to,quite literally, jump between worlds without any kind of delay involving regularspace or time.So where exactly was the sky world of the shaman during the age of Göbekli Tepe?In an attempt to answer this question, we must examine the deepest, mostprofound, cave art of Ice Age Europe."},{"pageContent":"6WINDOW ON ANOTHER WORLDIf the hermetic axiom of “as above, so below” were to be applied to theconstruction of Göbekli Tepe in the tenth millennium BC, then it would suggestthat ritual activity taking place within its enclosures was reflected in somemanner in the heavens, and vice versa. Going beyond the imagined portal createdby the twin pillars standing at the center of the structures is likely to haveprojected the shaman or initiate into some part of the night sky, but whereexactly?Some idea might be gleaned from the Ice Age cave artists of the late Paleolithicage. Although much of the beautiful imagery seen in the caves suggests a clearinterface between the physical world and the perceived supernatural realmsexisting beyond human consciousness, certain painted panels are now thought toconvey abstract celestial themes as well.1 [index_split_058.html#filepos933947]Three examples can be cited in this respect, and in each case the panels orfriezes are positioned in the direction of the area of sky where the relevantstars were to be seen during the epoch in question.THE LASCAUX SHAFT SCENEThe first example is the famous Shaft Scene from Lascaux Caves near Montignac inFrance’s Dordogne region. Located in a pit 16 feet (4.9 meters) deep, whichcould only be accessed using a rope (the remains of which have been found), thescene is composed of a set of images that have mystified paleontologists sincethe chance discovery of the cave complex by four teenagers in 1940.From right to left, the painted fresco—which is approximately ten feet (threemeters) across—shows a wounded bison, a birdman, a bird on a pole, and arhinoceros (see figure 6.1 on p. 70, although the rhino is not shown here).Black loops drawn beneath the bison’s belly indicate the release of itsentrails, perhaps by the barbed spear seen cutting across its body at an acuteangle. Either that or it has been gored by the rhinoceros, which appears to bewalking away from the scene. Facing the bison is a male human figure, who eitherhas the head of a bird or wears a bird mask. He leans backward in a most awkwardposition and has an erect penis, a stance that could indicate he is a birdshaman experiencing an ecstatic trance state (the ingestion of psychotropicsubstances often causes male erection).Confirming the significance of the figure’s avian features is the presence justbelow his feet of a bird on a pole, its head and beak resembling those of thebirdman. Off to the left is the rhinoceros, whose role is debatable; he couldhave gored the bison, or he might simply be associated with the birdman’sblatant display of virility (rhino horn, being phallic in appearance, is valuedin some cultures as an aphrodisiac). Next to the creature’s upraised tail aresix black dots drawn in pairs, the meaning of which is unclear.The panel’s awkward positioning at the bottom of a deep shaft, along with thefact that it shows the only human figure in the entire cave complex, indicatesthat it held some special significance to the Upper Paleolithic peoples whoentered Lascaux and decorated its corridors and halls with a whole menagerie ofIce Age animals.THE SUMMER TRIANGLEMany scholars have attempted to understand Lascaux’s Shaft Scene, although noconsensus regarding its meaning has ever been reached. However, in 2000 Germanscholar Dr. Michael Rappenglück of the University of Munich came up with a trulyinspired interpretation of the painted panel. He argues that the entire scene isan abstract map of an area of sky featuring a group of three bright stars knowncollectively as the Summer Triangle, these being Altair in Aquila, Vega in Lyra,and Deneb, the brightest star in the constellation of Cygnus, the celestial birdor swan, known also as the Northern Cross.2 [index_split_058.html#filepos934102]At the time the Shaft Scene was created, ca. 16,500–15,000 BC, Deneb acted asthe Pole Star, as it was the closest star to the celestial pole, the turningpoint of the heavens.[images/00006.jpg]Figure 6.1. The Shaft Scene inside the pit at Lascaux in southern France.Solutrean period, ca. 16,500–15,000 BC.Today Polaris, a star in the constellation of Ursa Minor, the Little Bear, marksthe position of the celestial pole in the northern night sky. Yet over time, thePole Star changes due to the effects of precession—the slow wobble of the earthacross a cycle of approximately twenty-six thousand years. During the pyramidage, Thuban, a minor star in the constellation of Draco, the celestial dragon,held the position of Pole Star. Going back further, Vega in Lyra was Pole Starfrom around 13,000 BC to 11,000 BC. Before that the pole had been marked byDelta Cygni, one of the wing stars of Cygnus. It gained the role from itsneighbor Deneb, which was Pole Star from around 16,500 BC until ca. 14,500 BC.That Deneb was Pole Star when the Shaft Scene was created makes sense of itsconnection with the Summer Triangle, especially as Cygnus is universally seen asa celestial bird. In other words, the bird shown on the pole at Lascaux isCygnus marking the celestial pole, with the pole itself representing thevertical axis, or sky pole, which turns the heavens and holds up the sky. As tothe birdman, he might well signify a shaman who has attained a trance state andascended the sky pole in the guise of a bird associated in some manner withastral flight and, of course, the Cygnus asterism, or star group. Moreover, theShaft Scene is located on a north-facing wall, which corresponds to thedirection of the Summer Triangle during this distant epoch. It is almost as ifthe panel is an imaginary window onto the celestial world it portrays.This theory suggests that the area of sky in question held a special place inthe beliefs and practices of the Ice Age peoples responsible for executing thecave art. Such practices, which perhaps involved a ritual descent into the shaftusing the rope provided, very likely acted as a symbolic means of shifting fromone level of reality to another. In this way the Paleolithic shamans orinitiates could commune with perceived supernatural intelligences in a sky worldthought to exist beyond the celestial pole.On its own, the directing of Lascaux’s Shaft Scene toward the stars its panelrepresents might seem like a happy coincidence. However, elsewhere in theLascaux Caves other murals have been identified as abstract representations ofknown asterisms. For instance, Rappenglück and others see the head, horns, andupper torso of a bull in the Salle des Taureaux, or Hall of the Bulls, as arepresentation of the constellation of Taurus, the bull, with a grouping of sixto seven dots next to it being seen as the nearby star cluster known as thePleiades.3 [index_split_058.html#filepos934252] As with the Shaft Scene, theanimals on the wall of the Salle des Taureaux face toward where the stars inquestion would have been visible during the epoch in question.THE VENUS AND THE SORCERERA third example of the relationship between Ice Age cave art and celestialthemes can be found in the Chauvet Cave of southern France, which overlooks anancient gorge through which the Ardèche River once flowed. Discovered asrecently as 1994, its painted galleries, full of breathtaking friezes showing avariety of Ice Age animals, are among the oldest so far discovered, having beenexecuted by Paleolithic cave artists around thirty-two thousand years ago. Ofspecial interest here is the fact that in the Salle du Fond, or End Chamber,located in the deepest part of the complex, a remarkable piece of walldecoration can be found. Called the Venus and the Sorcerer, it appears on avertically hanging cone of limestone (a form of stalactite) that comes to within3 feet 6 inches (1 meter) of the cave floor.The Venus in question is an abstract torso, hips, vulva, and legs of afull-bodied woman, arguably one of the oldest known two-dimensionalrepresentations of the female form in existence; it is also the only humanfigure to be seen anywhere in the caves. The Sorcerer is a young bison, its headoverlying the woman’s belly or womb, its left front leg doubling as her leftleg, indicating a special relationship between the two figures. Completing thescene is the head and upper body of a large feline, perhaps a panther or lion,which extends above and to the left of the woman’s body as if the former isemerging from the latter (see figure 6.2).The strange image is unique, without anything else quite like it in the entirecave complex, and would seem to have been a central focus of the cave artists’ritual activity. Thus any suggestion that the panel might depict abstractrepresentations of celestial objects should be taken seriously, especially whenwe find that it could well reflect the same region of sky as Lascaux’s ShaftScene.THE GREAT RIFTSwiss researcher Franz Gnaedinger has proposed that the woman’s torso andgenitalia represent the Summer Triangle, within which the young bison’s head andshoulders are perfectly framed.*2 [index_split_057.html#filepos911980] This isan inspiring theory, although a more positive identification would be to suggestthat the woman’s vulva and scissorlike legs represent the area of the Milky Wayknown as the Great Rift (also known as the Dark Rift, Cygnus Rift, and GreatCleft), which is framed within the Summer Triangle (see figure 6.3 on p. 74).This is a dark band of stellar dust and debris in line with the galactic planethat causes the Milky Way to appear to split into two separate streams in theregion of the Cygnus constellation. As a dark band it continues to where theecliptic, the path of the sun, crosses the Milky Way in the region of the starsof Sagittarius and Scorpius, or Scorpio, the celestial scorpion. Here one “leg”of the Milky Way peters out as the other expands in width and continues into thesouthern sky.[images/00008.jpg]Figure 6.2. The Venus and the Sorcerer panel inside the Chauvet Cave. Note howthe woman and bull share the same leg, while the large feline seems to emergefrom the scene.If Chauvet’s Venus figure really is an expression of the Milky Way, then thehead of the young bison might be viewed as emerging from the Great Rift like anewborn child. As alien as such a concept might seem, there are 3-Drepresentations and murals showing women, goddesses perhaps, giving birth tobull calves at Çatal Höyük, the Neolithic city on the Konya Plain in southerncentral Turkey, which dates to ca. 7500–5700 BC (see figure 6.4).[images/00045.jpg]Figure 6.3. The Venus and the Sorcerer from the Chauvet Cave overlaid on theMilky Way, showing that the woman’s legs form the twin streams of the GreatRift, while the head of the bull calf in her womb area corresponds to theposition of the stars of Cygnus and Cepheus.[images/00012.jpg]Figure 6.4. Three-dimensional panel showing a leopard-headed woman giving birthto a bull calf, from the Neolithic city of Çatal Höyük, ca. 7500–5700 BC.In addition to forming the outline of a bird in flight, the arrangement of theCygnus stars resemble the frontal view of a bovine head, complete with extendedhorns. It is a realization that probably inspired both the Chauvet Cave’s Venusand Sorcerer panel and the ancient Egyptian belief that the sun is reborn eachmorning in the form of a bull calf, which emerges from between the twin streamsof the Milky Way’s Great Rift.4 [index_split_058.html#filepos934417]Yet if Chauvet’s Venus is an abstract representation of the Milky Way in theregion of the Great Rift, and the bull calf signifies the Cygnus stars, whatdoes the large feline represent? Its position immediately above the otherfigures gives the impression that it is either responsible for or connected withwhat is displayed, suggesting that it too is a representation of something to beseen in the heavens. Universally, large felines, such as panthers, jaguars,pumas, and lions, have been seen as personifications, and even controllingintelligences, of the night sky. Is it possible that the example at Chauvetplays a similar role? Could it be seen as the “father,” or progenitor, of thebull calf, with the Venus as its mother—the feline, bull, and woman having somekind of symbiotic relationship?As with the proposed astronomical frescoes at Lascaux, the Venus and Sorcererpanel at Chauvet is located at the extreme northern end of the cave complex at aposition suggesting that it too acted as a symbolic window onto the section ofsky represented by the images in question. If this surmise is correct, it couldsuggest that the Ice Age artists that executed this extraordinary cave art somethirty-two thousand years ago possessed, like those at Lascaux, a highly complexunderstanding of the night sky that we are only now beginning to comprehend.CAVE SCENES TO CULT SHRINESAll this is very interesting and might well be correct. Yet linking Ice Age caveart with the design of sacred enclosures created at Göbekli Tepe in southeastAnatolia thousands of years later might seem presumptuous. It is a fact,however, that in the early Neolithic, stalagmites and stalactites were removedfrom cave interiors and carried back to Çatal Höyük, where they were placed incult shrines alongside statuettes, bucrania, vulture beaks, and painted frescoesof extraordinary beauty and sophistication. So many fragments from caves werefound there that British archaeologist James Mellaart, who excavated the site inthe 1960s, proposed that the shrines at Çatal Höyük might have been the realm ofchthonic deities; that is, gods of the underworld.5[index_split_058.html#filepos934551]B. C. Dietrich, Ph.D., author of The Origins of Greek Religion, went further bysuggesting that the ritual activities practiced in Çatal Höyük’s cult shrineshad formerly been celebrated in primordial cave settings, adding that: “Thoughthe locality of the cult may have changed, its form did not relax its curioushold on the mind of the worshipper who, over many generations, retained theaniconic stalagmite as an image of his goddess.”6[index_split_058.html#filepos934682] This, of course, resonates with the mannerin which the limestone cone in the Chauvet Cave was utilized in the creation ofthe Venus and Sorcerer panel.If the sacred enclosures at Göbekli Tepe do reflect an interest in the celestialheavens, was it just a symbolic gesture, without any kind of real accuracy, orwas there true precision involved in their construction? We examine now theevidence presented by the T-shaped pillars, which reveal a recurring patternthat will leave the reader in little doubt that they were once turned towardsomething very specific in the night sky."},{"pageContent":"7TURNED TOWARD THE STARSIn the knowledge that megalithic monuments worldwide have been found to possessalignments toward celestial bodies, such as the sun, moon, and stars, it seemsreasonable to look for something similar at Göbekli Tepe, with the most obviouscandidates for orientation being the various sets of twin pillars at the centerof the different enclosures. These could have acted as astronomical markers,especially as at the time of their construction a clear view of the localhorizon would have been visible in all directions from their elevated positions.Even a cursory glance at the positioning of the different sets of twin pillarsin the main enclosures shows them to be aligned roughly north-south. Thissuggests they are unlikely to have targeted the sun, moon, or planets, which allrise in the east and set in the west. Clearly, if their orientations meananything, then the enclosures must have been built to target a star or stellarobject that either rose or set close to the imaginary north-south meridian linethat divides the sky in two and crosses directly overhead.ANGLES OF ORIENTATIONEstablishing the precise orientations of the enclosures’ central pillars was putto chartered engineer Rodney Hale, who for the past fifteen years has made adetailed study of stellar alignments at prehistoric and sacred sites around theworld. He examined Göbekli Tepe’s detailed survey plan and determined that thecentral pillars in Enclosures B, C, D, and E (the Felsentempel, or rock temple,located to the west of the main group) all seemed to be aligned just west ofnorth, and, equally, just east of south, in the following manner:Enclosure B 337°/157°Enclosure C 345°/165°Enclosure D 353°/173°Enclosure E 350°/170°The twin pillars marking the entrance to an apse-like feature at the northernend of Enclosure A were turned much farther west. Indeed, they are oriented 312degrees/132 degrees, just 3 degrees off northwest-southeast, suggesting thatwhatever it was they were oriented toward had little to do with the primaryalignments of the larger enclosures.The slight differences in the mean azimuths of the central pillars in EnclosuresB, C, D, and E is telling, as it suggests that each set targeted a star orstellar object that was very gradually shifting its position against the localhorizon as a result of precession (see figure 7.1). Thus the enclosures werealigned to a celestial object that either set each night on thenorth-northwestern horizon or, equally, rose each night on the south-southeasthorizon.AN ORION CORRELATION?Among the southern star groups and constellations looked at by Hale were theHyades, Taurus, the Pleiades, and Orion (more specifically its three “belt”stars), all of which have been claimed to match the orientations of the twinpillars in the various enclosures at Göbekli Tepe during the epoch of theirconstruction.1 [index_split_058.html#filepos934914] Out of these, just onecandidate emerged as perhaps playing some role at Göbekli Tepe, and this wasOrion, the celestial hunter.Rodney Hale charted the risings of Orion’s principal stars between 9500 BC and8000 BC, then matched this information against the window of opportunity createdby the orientations of the central pillars in the various enclosures at GöbekliTepe.*3 [index_split_057.html#filepos912323] However, the results weredisappointing. Although potential alignments existed between Enclosure B and theOrion belt stars between 9000 BC and 8600 BC, the mean azimuths of the centralpillars in Enclosures C, D, and E did not target the rising of any of Orion’sbelt stars between 9500 BC and 8000 BC. The constellation’s other keystars—Betelgeuse, Bellatrix, Saiph, and Rigel—fared even worse, making it highlyunlikely that Orion was involved in the orientation of Göbekli Tepe’s principalenclosures.[images/00015.jpg]Figure 7.1. The main enclosures at Göbekli Tepe showing the mean alignments oftheir central pillars.ALIGNED TO SIRIUS?Giulio Magli, a professor of mathematical physics at the Politecnico of Milan,also dismisses Orion’s role in the alignment of the twin pillars at GöbekliTepe. To accept such a hypothesis, he says, would mean reducing the age of themountaintop sanctuaries by as much as a thousand years, something that goesagainst all dating evidence emerging from the site at this time.2[index_split_058.html#filepos935061]Instead, Magli proposes that the mean azimuths of the twin pillars in EnclosuresB, C, and D were aligned to the rising of the star Sirius, which made itsreappearance in the night skies from the latitude of Göbekli Tepe sometimearound 9500 BC.3 [index_split_058.html#filepos935409] For a period of aroundfifty-five hundred years prior to this time it had been missing from the skiesdue to the effects of precession. Magli surmises that the hunter-gatherers ofthe region might have created the temples at Göbekli Tepe to honor theappearance of this new “guest” star in the night sky.Magli’s theory was put to the test by Rodney Hale. He calculated, by recognizedmethods, that in the epoch of Göbekli Tepe’s construction, ca. 9500–8900 BC,Sirius, which only just rose above the southern horizon at this time, would havebeen so dim due to the effects of atmospheric absorption and aerosol pollutionthat it is unlikely to have impressed the region’s hunter-gatherers.4[index_split_058.html#filepos935509] Moreover, the meager arc the star made asit crossed the southern horizon was so brief that in just twenty minutes itwould have shifted its horizontal position a full 3 degrees, making it adifficult and highly unrealistic stellar target to use for such a purpose.5[index_split_058.html#filepos935838]In conclusion, it seems totally improbable that the Paleolithic peoples ofsoutheast Anatolia gave up their free lives as hunters to worship such aninsignificant star. Clearly, if astronomical phenomena really did inspire thesepeople’s building motivations, then it did not involve either the stars of Orionor the lone star Sirius.NORTH OR SOUTH?In fact, there is a fundamental problem in even assuming that the mainenclosures at Göbekli Tepe are oriented south, for although the humanlikefeatures of the central monoliths are all turned this direction, there is noreason to conclude that their gaze is fixed toward the southern skyline. Morelikely, they greet the entrant approaching from the south in the same mannerthat statues in churches face the worshipper approaching the high altar. Churchaltars are located in the east, as this is the direction of heaven in Christiantradition, and also because churches were often aligned toward the positionwhere the sun rises on the feast day of its patron saint. Just because Jesus,Saint Michael, or the Virgin Mary faces away from the high altar does not meantheir gaze is fixed toward the western skyline.In Göbekli Tepe’s case, if its enclosures did have a high altar or holy ofholies, then it would have been in the north, the direction of darkness, wherethe sun never rises. It is also the direction of the celestial pole, the turningpoint of the heavens. In southeast and eastern Anatolia, northerly orientationsof early Neolithic cult buildings have been noted at Çayönü, Nevalı Çori, andHallan Çemi in the eastern Taurus Mountains (see chapter 23). It thus seemslikely that Göbekli Tepe’s enclosures are oriented toward the north, and not thesouth.Concluding that Göbekli Tepe’s central pillars face south without taking intoaccount the significance that the north plays in Anatolia’s early Neolithictradition would be very foolish indeed. What is more, the Sabaeans, the paganstar worshippers of the ancient city of Harran—the ruins of which are overlookedby Göbekli Tepe—each year celebrated the Mystery of the North, since this wasdeemed the direction of the primal cause and the source of life itself.6[index_split_058.html#filepos935938] As we saw in the prologue, the earliestinhabitants of the city, who thrived a full ten thousand years ago, were verylikely the direct descendants of the Göbekli builders.Similar beliefs of the north being the original qibla, or direction of prayer,were held by other ethno-religious groups of the region, including theangel-worshipping Yezidi, the Mandaeans of Iraq and Iran, and an Ismaili sectknown as the Brethren of Purity.7 [index_split_058.html#filepos936142] All ofthem most likely inherited aspects of their beliefs and practices from muchearlier cultures with roots in the Neolithic age. With these thoughts in mind,Hale now turned his attention to the northern sky to identify any possiblestellar targets there.TARGET REVEALEDJust one star emerged as a potential candidate, and this was Deneb, thebrightest star in the constellation of Cygnus, the celestial bird. Before 9500BC Deneb was circumpolar, in that it never set, although after this time,through the effects of precession, it started to set each night on thenorth-northwestern horizon. As the centuries rolled by, the star’s point ofextinction moved ever westward in a manner that, as we see below, not only makessense of the mean azimuths of the various sets of twin pillars at Göbekli Tepebut also offers realistic construction dates for the enclosures in question.Enclosure D @ 353° = 9400 BC*4 [index_split_057.html#filepos912533]Enclosure E @ 350° = 9290 BCEnclosure C @ 345° = 8980 BCEnclosure B @ 337° = 8235 BCThese dates should not be seen as absolute, as we have no idea as to what levelof accuracy the Göbekli builders employed in their building construction. Even asmall error in the positioning of the central pillars could alter the proposedalignment toward a stellar object by as much as a hundred years. Having saidthis, the construction dates of the various pairs of central pillars—suggestedby their alignment to Deneb—correlate pretty well with available radiocarbondates obtained from key enclosures.ENCLOSURE DATESFor instance, loam taken from wall plaster found in Göbekli Tepe’s Enclosure Dhas provided a radiocarbon age of 9745–9314 BC,8[index_split_058.html#filepos936242] which corresponds perfectly with a date ofca. 9400 BC defined by the alignment of its twin pillars toward Deneb at thistime. Interestingly, bone samples taken from Enclosure B have provided aradiocarbon age of 8306–8236 BC,9 [index_split_058.html#filepos936447] whichcoincides with a suggested construction date of ca. 8235 BC implied by its twinpillars’ alignment toward Deneb. Having said this, radiocarbon specialist OliverDietrich of the German Archaeological Institute believes these burials couldhave been made long after the construction of the enclosure, so no more can besaid on the matter until better dating evidence becomes available.10[index_split_058.html#filepos936547] Other radiocarbon dates have been obtainedfrom organic materials found within the fill used to cover the major enclosures,and these range from the late tenth to the late ninth millennium BC, the time ofthe site’s final abandonment.11 [index_split_058.html#filepos936894]Clearly, the possibility that the central pillars in Göbekli Tepe’s mainenclosures were aligned to reflect the precessional shift of a singleastronomical target across an extended period of time is borne out by theastronomical data presented by Rodney Hale. What is more, there is evidence thatcult buildings at other Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites in southeast Anatolia mightalso have reflected an interest in the star Deneb. For instance, the FlagstoneBuilding, Skull Building, and Terrazzo Building at Çayönü are also alignednorth-northwest with entrances in their southern walls (see figure 7.2 on p.84). Hale checked their orientations, based on available plans, and establishedthat they reflect alignments toward the setting of Deneb between ca. 8825 BC and7950 BC—shown in the following table12[index_split_058.html#filepos936995]—dates that accord well with recentrevisions of Çayönü’s age based on radiocarbon evidence obtained during the1960s.13 [index_split_058.html#filepos937270] Structure Azimuth Deneb Setting Date Flagstone Building 345.35° 8810BC Skull Building 345.86° 8825 BC Terrazzo Building 336.20° 7950 BC CELESTIAL MARKERSComing to Göbekli Tepe’s Enclosure E, the Felsentempel, where all the pillarshave been removed and only the slots within the stone pedestals remain, we findthat the orientation of its twin pillars targeted the setting of Deneb at a dateof ca. 9290 BC, some 110 years later than those of Enclosure D (see figure 7.3on p. 84). This said, the fact that Enclosure E’s standing pillars have beenremoved makes it impossible to verify whether it really was aligned north towardDeneb. We are, however, on much firmer ground with Enclosure C.According to Hale’s calculations, Enclosure C’s central pillars targeted thesetting of Deneb around 8980 BC, suggesting that this was the time frame oftheir construction (no radiocarbon dates are available at present for thisstructure).*5 [index_split_057.html#filepos912748] Yet the rectangular slots cutout of the bedrock pedestals to support Enclosure C’s twin monoliths are alignedslightly more toward north than the pillars themselves. They are askew only byabout a degree, although the difference between the stones and their slots isnoticeable. This might indicate that the pillars target Deneb at a date slightlylater than the construction of the slots, which could reflect the position ofthe star at an earlier date. If so, then quite possibly the enclosure is olderthan the 8980 BC date suggested by the proposed astronomical alignment of itstwin pillars, perhaps by as much as a century or so. It is even possible thatthe monoliths were repositioned when it was realized they no longer synched withthe setting of Deneb. So around 8980 BC they were turned very slightly toreflect the star’s new setting position. If this theory is correct, then it ispossible that the Göbekli builders were familiar with the effects of precession,which shifts a star against the local horizon at a rate of around one degreeevery seventy-two years.[images/00017.jpg]Figure 7.2. The three cult buildings at Çayönü—the Terrazzo Building, SkullBuilding, and Flagstone Building. All are oriented north-northwest withentrances in the south.[images/00019.jpg]Figure 7.3. The alignment of Enclosure D’s central pillars toward the star Denebin Cygnus and the opening of the Milky Way’s Great Rift, ca. 9400 BC.SIGHTING STONE DISCOVERYFurther evidence of Göbekli Tepe’s proposed astronomical alignments comes fromEnclosure D. A stone pillar standing around 5 feet (1.5 meters) in height hasrecently been found in its north-northwestern perimeter wall, exactly behind andin line with its central pillars (see figure 10.3 on p. 109). The stone isrectangular, and unlike the rings of radially oriented pillars found in the mainenclosures, it has one of its wider faces turned toward the center of thestructure. The significance of this stone is that it has a hole some 9 to 10inches (23–25 centimeters) in diameter bored through it horizontally at a heightof around 3 feet (1 meter) off the ground. Covering the stone is a series ofcurved lines, which flow in pairs and converge just beneath the hole beforetrailing off toward the stone’s right-hand corner. Very likely they are a naïverepresentation of the human torso complete with legs bent at the knees (seechapter 10).If the enclosure’s twin pillars were indeed oriented toward Deneb, then aperson, a shaman perhaps, would have been able to look through the stone’ssighting hole to see Deneb setting on the north-northwestern horizon, a quitemagnificent sight that cannot have happened by chance alone. Clearly, this ispowerful evidence that the enclosure really was directed toward this star duringthe epoch of its construction.A similar holed stone exists in Enclosure C, which is also located within thenorth-northwest section of the temenos wall (see figure 10.1 on p. 106).Designated Pillar 59, it has been turned over onto its eastern side and isfractured across its hole, with the top section now missing. The diameter of thehole is very slightly larger than the one in the corresponding stone inEnclosure D, measuring 11 to 12 inches (28–30.5 centimeters). This is also theapproximate width of the stone through which the hole has been bored.The holed stone in Enclosure C remains only partly exposed. It leans forward sothat no indication of whether it bears any carved relief, like its partner inEnclosure D, can yet be determined. What does seem clear is that when in itsoriginal position, Pillar 59 would have stood exactly behind and in line withEnclosure C’s twin central pillars. This means that it too could have been usedto observe the setting of Deneb when standing between the twin pillars duringthe epoch of its construction (bearing in mind that a second, inner ring ofstones was added after the original construction of the outer circle, accordingto Klaus Schmidt.14 [index_split_058.html#filepos937819] Its construction wouldquite possibly have obscured the line of vision from the twin central pillars tothe holed stone).SOUL HOLESSo what exactly are these holed stones that once stood in the same positions inEnclosures C and D? The answer almost certainly is that they are seelenloch, aGerman word meaning “soul hole” (seelenlocher, “soul holes,” in plural). AcrossEurope*6 [index_split_057.html#filepos913373] and also in southwest Asia†7[index_split_057.html#filepos914051] megalithic structures, such as dolmens,passage graves, and chambered tombs, often incorporate upright entrance stonesinto which circular holes have been bored. These holes are usually between 10and 16 inches (25–41 centimeters) in diameter, which makes them too small for anadult to pass through. This has led to speculation that they must have servedsome kind of symbolic function.Prehistorians have suggested that the holes in dolmens might have allowedofferings of food to be made to the dead following their initial interment. Thisis at least possible. Yet more often than not, holed entrances to megalithicstructures are interpreted as seelenloch, holes that are believed to allow thespirit or soul of the deceased to exit the tomb. (Even Klaus Schmidt hassuggested that fragmented stone rings found at Göbekli Tepe during the earliestsurveys of the site might have functioned as seelenloch.15[index_split_058.html#filepos937955] This, however, was long before thediscovery of the aforementioned holed stones in Enclosures C and D.)Holes were also bored into the shoulders or sides of cremation urns in RomanEurope,16 [index_split_058.html#filepos938085] and also in the Ararat Valley ofeastern Anatolia during the Bronze Age,17 [index_split_058.html#filepos938315]apparently with similar purposes in mind. In places such as the Austrian Tyrolthe concept of the seelenloch persisted until the twentieth century. Here,circular “doors” were built into the walls of houses, which were opened onlywhen a person died in the house, the purpose being to allow the soul of thedeceased to leave its earthly surroundings and depart for the afterlife.18[index_split_058.html#filepos938509]CAUCASIAN DOLMENSBy far the greatest concentration of dolmens with façades or entrance stones,into which holes have been bored, are to be found in the Caucasus region ofAbkhazia and southern Russia, on the northeast coast of the Black Sea. Here asmany as three thousand structures of this kind have been noted, many of whichhave never been properly recorded. Those that have been investigated produceradiocarbon dates and artifacts suggesting a construction date during the BronzeAge, ca. 3000–2000 BC.19 [index_split_058.html#filepos938929]Many of the dolmens have paved-stone enclosures with tememos walls thatincorporate the porthole stone. The similarity in design between thesemegalithic enclosures in the Caucasus and Göbekli Tepe’s Enclosures C and D,with their own holed stones forming part of the temenos wall, is uncanny andmust surely form part of a similar tradition.Many of the Caucasian dolmens have carved reliefs around their portholes. Oftenthis shows twin pillars or supports capped with a trilithon (like those atStonehenge), creating the image of a gateway or doorway, similar to the toriientrance gates to Japanese Shinto shrines. These carved gateways are curiouslyreminiscent of the twin pillars standing at the center of the enclosures atGöbekli Tepe.It thus seems likely that the holed stones in Göbekli Tepe’s Enclosures C and Dfunctioned as seelenloch. If correct, then whether this rite of passage throughthe stone’s bored hole related to souls of the deceased leaving the enclosure orunborn souls entering this world is a matter of debate discussed in chapter 10.More obviously, the seelenloch enabled the soul or spirit of the shaman to exitthe structure.PASSAGE OF THE SOULWhile in an ecstatic or altered state of consciousness a shaman imagines him-orherself entering a hole or tunnel that allows access to otherworldlyenvironments, either in the lower world (underworld) or upper world (sky world).Often these holes, particularly those leading to the lower world, are reachedthrough the visualization of physical holes such as water holes, holes in treetrunks, circular depressions in rocks, entrances to caves, or holes carved inpolished circular stones, similar to the jade bi or pi disks of Chinese folktradition.20 [index_split_058.html#filepos939154] These are thought to symbolizethe starry vault, with the hole in the center representing the access point toheaven.21 [index_split_058.html#filepos939429] Siberian shamans often wear ontheir coats disks with holes, which are usually made of iron. They bear namessuch as künjeta (“sun”) and oibon künga (“hole-in-the-ice sun”) and correspondwith invisible holes (oibone) in the shaman’s body used in spiritcommunication.22 [index_split_058.html#filepos939661]This then is what the porthole stones in Göbekli Tepe’s Enclosures C and D mostlikely signified—points of exit for the shaman’s soul on journeys to the skyworld, accessed via the star Deneb in Cygnus. Yet why was this particular areaof the sky of such interest to the shamans of the early Neolithic? The answerseems to lie in the fact that Deneb cannot take all the credit for causing theGöbekli builders to align the various sets of twin pillars toward thenorth-northwest. For Deneb’s role as a stellar marker is in fact secondary tothe Milky Way’s Great Rift, which, as we find out next, was once seen as anentrance to the sky world."},{"pageContent":"8THE PATH OF SOULS;The orientation of the central pillars in Göbekli Tepe’s main enclosures towardboth Deneb and the Milky Way’s Great Rift is by no means unique. All around theglobe ancient cultures and societies saw this area of the heavens as an entranceto the sky world. It was considered a place of the gods, a land of theancestors, and the source of creation in the universe.For instance, the ancient Maya of Central America pictured Xibalba, theirunderworld, as accessible from a sky road known as ri b’e xib’alb’a, the BlackRoad, identified as the Milky Way’s Great Rift.1[index_split_058.html#filepos940038] Its actual entrance or location wasrepresented by cave and mouth imagery, often accompanied by a symbol known asthe Cross Bands glyph. This has the appearance of a letter X inside a squareframe and has been identified with the Cygnus stars in their guise as acelestial cross, made up of five specific stars.2[index_split_058.html#filepos940210] The actual road to Xibalba (a word meaning“place of fear”) is shown as a caiman crocodile, its long jaws the twin streamscreated by the Great Rift, with its head, eyes, and gullet located in thevicinity of the Cygnus region (see figure 8.1 on p. 90).In Mayan mythology the solar god One Hunahpu was reborn from the mouth of thecaiman. The sun god was perhaps imagined as being carried along the length ofthe creature’s open jaws to the place where the ecliptic, the sun’s path,crosses the Milky Way in the vicinity of the stars of Sagittarius and Scorpius.3[index_split_058.html#filepos940404] This is a point corresponding, visually atleast, with the nuclear bulge in the galactic plane that marks the center of theMilky Way galaxy. The sun god reached this point of rebirth at the moment ofsunrise on the winter solstice.[images/00022.jpg]Figure 8.1. Left, caiman crocodile overlaid on the Milky Way’s Great Rift, asconceived by the Maya of Central America. Right, the Milky Way’s Great Rift onits own for comparison.The Olmec of Mexico, whom the Maya might well have seen as spiritual forebears,created grotesque stone offering tables with the likeness of the head and jawsof a monstrous jaguar. From the creature’s open mouth (some see it as a caveentrance) a deity identified as a were-jaguar—half human, half jaguar—is seenemerging. Although next to nothing is known about Olmec cosmology, it probablyinvolved mythological ideas similar to those of the Maya.As the Cross Bands glyph appears on these offering tables, usually eitherbetween the teeth of the monster or on the headdress worn by the were-jaguar, itis likely the Olmec also had some concept of the sun god being reborn from theMilky Way’s Great Rift, seen as the cavelike mouth of a hideous sky monster.CLEAVING OPEN THE PORTALSThe Maya manufactured enormous ceremonial ax heads in jade that take the form ofabstract were-jaguars, the lips on their human faces downturned in a peculiarand highly exaggerated manner (see figure 8.2). Across the top of the head,going from front to back, is a furrow or cleft, which has a deeply significantmeaning, for on the were-jaguar’s breech cloth the Cross Bands glyph appears,like the Union Jack emblazoned on a belt buckle. According to the labelaccompanying the British Museum’s own were-jaguar hand ax:> The crossed bands glyph incised on the breech cloth signifies an entrance or> opening. . . . These symbols (i.e., the glyph and the cleft on the top of the> head) proclaim the axe’s magical power to cleave open the portals into the> spirit world.As that “spirit world” was almost certainly Xibalba, it confirms that the CrossBands glyph symbolizes its “entrance or opening,” which, as we have seen, wasmarked by the constellation of Cygnus, the Northern Cross. Even the cleft isevidence of this connection, for the Great Rift is known also as the GreatCleft, as it appears to cleave the Milky Way in two, a symbolic act carried outin Mayan tradition by the jade ax in its celestial guise.[images/00024.jpg]Figure 8.2. Left, Olmec altar at La Venta, in Mexico’s Tabasco state, showing afigure emerging from the cave-like mouth of the were-jaguar. Note the CrossBands glyph between the creature’s fangs. Right, Mayan ax in jade fashioned intothe likeness of the were-jaguar. Note the cross bands glyph on the belt bucklearea of the breeches and the cleft on the top of the head.THE DENEB PORTALSimilar ideas regarding a spirit world existing beyond the opening to the GreatRift are held even today by a number of Native American tribes, whose star mythsare thought to have a common origin among the Mississippi mound-buildingcultures, forming what is known as the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, whichthrived ca. AD 1200–1650.4 [index_split_058.html#filepos940770] The mostconsistent story that emerges from their beliefs and practices tells of how indeath the soul departs to the west, a journey that takes three to four days tocomplete. When finally it reaches the edge of the Earth’s disk, the soul waitsfor the right moment to make a leap of faith to enter the Milky Way, theso-called Path of Souls, via a star portal, knowing that the consequences offailing this difficult jump will mean being lost forever in the lower world.The portal is marked by a celestial hand, its fingers pointing downward and madeup of stars belonging to the Orion constellation, the three belt stars markingthe severed wrist. It is a symbol found again and again in the iconography ofthe Southeastern Ceremonial Complex and dates back to the Hopewell moundbuilders of Ohio, who thrived some two thousand years ago.The actual portal is the stellar object Messier 42, a small, fuzzy nebulalocated in Orion’s “sword.” Here the soul joins the Milky Way and travels southand then north until it reaches a fork on the path identified with the twin armsof the Great Rift. Its longer arm, the one bridging the two halves of the MilkyWay, is envisioned as a log spanning a celestial river that the soul must crossto reach the sky world.Yet before the soul can cross the log bridge it has to encounter its guardian,most usually a “forked-eye raptor,” a supernatural eagle known as the “BrainSmasher,” identified with the star Deneb. Only by receiving the right judgmentcan the soul avoid Brain Smasher and pass over the log and enter the afterlife.If the judgment is not favorable, the soul is forced to take the Great Rift’sshorter, severed arm, which leads only to oblivion. Clearly, the raptor isCygnus in its role as the celestial bird, its forked eye the Milky Way’s GreatRift (see figure 8.3).STORM DEMON WITH OPEN MOUTHHow exactly the Göbekli builders might have viewed the starry existence beyondthe Great Rift is now lost. Yet some idea of their understanding of cosmicgeography can be gleaned from the star lore recorded in cuneiform script by theastronomer-priests of the civilizations that thrived on the Mesopotamia Plain inwhat is today Iraq.[images/00027.jpg]Figure 8.3. Native American symbols from artifacts found at mound sites. Notethe raptor, which represents Cygnus, and the eye in the hand, representingOrion, above which is a circle that represents the bright star Deneb in Cygnus(after Greg Little).Babylonian texts, which contain source material that goes back to the thirdmillennium BC, catalogue dozens of stellar objects, either stars or asterisms, afew of which, such as the Scorpion (Scorpius), the Goat-headed Fish (Capricorn),and the Lion (Leo), are recognizable from their equivalents in the Greek zodiac.The stars of Cygnus would seem to have been combined with others from theneighboring constellation of Cepheus (located immediately above Deneb inastronomical terms) to create a huge griffinlike creature with the head and bodyof a panther (nimru in Akkadian) and the wings, back feet, and tail of an eagle.Its name was MULUD.KA.DUH.A, which means “constellation (MUL) of the storm-demonwith an open mouth,” and it was seen as the place of reception of dead souls.5[index_split_058.html#filepos941554]With the head of the panther in Cygnus6 [index_split_058.html#filepos941694] andits tail in Cepheus (making it perfectly synchronized with the Milky Way), itbecomes clear that in Babylonian star lore the entrance to the realm of the deadwas through the mouth or gullet of MULUD.KA.DUH.A, which corresponds to theopening of the Great Rift. This, of course, is similar to the Olmec and Mayanconception of the entrance to the underworld being through the mouth of agruesome monster, either a jaguar or caiman. For this reason, it seems certainthat the Babylonians, and presumably their forebears the Sumerians andAkkadians, saw the entrance to the netherworld, or realm of the dead, assynonymous with the Great Rift.VENERATION OF THE POLE STARFrom the evidence presented here, it seems likely that the Pre-Pottery Neolithicpeoples of southeast Anatolia considered Deneb the visible marker for theopening into a sky world accessed via the Milky Way’s Great Rift. Why exactlythis particular area of the sky became so important to the mind-set of thePre-Pottery Neolithic world of southeast Anatolia lies in the fact that therewas no Pole Star when Göbekli Tepe was constructed, ca. 9500–8000 BC. In otherwords, the celestial pole was not marked by any bright stellar object in thenight sky. Thus it seems reasonable to suggest that the Göbekli builders adheredto much earlier Paleolithic traditions regarding the location of the sky worldthat reached back to a time when Deneb was Pole Star, ca. 16,500–14,500 BC. Itwas, of course, during this epoch that the Lascaux Shaft Scene was created byPaleolithic cave artists. This shows the bird on the pole, perhaps signifyingthe ascent of the bird-headed shaman (depicted next to it) into a sky worldaccessed through the celestial pole, marked at that time by Cygnus in the formof a bird.SHIFTING POLE STARSIs it really possible that the people of Göbekli Tepe followed a tradition thatwas more than five thousand years old? As already mentioned, the effects ofprecession caused the celestial pole to shift away from Cygnus around 13,000 BC.Thereafter it entered the constellation of Lyra, causing its bright star Vega tobecome Pole Star, ca. 13,000–11,000 BC. So why had the sky watchers of this agenot switched their allegiance from Cygnus to Vega? The answer is that somePaleolithic cultures probably did start seeing Vega as the point of entry to thesky world. However, others almost certainly remained loyal to Cygnus, and Denebin particular, simply because it synchronized with the start of the Milky Way’sGreat Rift, which was already considered the rightful entrance to the sky world.Visually, the star Vega lies well away from both the Great Rift and the MilkyWay, explaining why the star might not have attained the same significance asDeneb.So not only did Vega lose its importance around 11,000 BC, but veneration ofDeneb and the Great Rift as the true entrance to the sky world was almostcertainly on the increase again, a situation that probably existed when the mainenclosures at Göbekli Tepe were under construction in the tenth millennium BC.It thus makes sense that the builders of these monuments, the oldest known startemples anywhere in the world, chose to align them to the opening of the GreatRift, the most obvious point of entry into the sky world at that time.Yet as we shall see next, the method by which the soul made its journey to andfrom the sky world was by using Cygnus’s most primordial totem, the celestialbird, which we find represented quite spectacularly in the carved art at GöbekliTepe."},{"pageContent":"9CULT OF THE VULTUREAt Çatal Höyük, the 9,500-year-old Neolithic city in southern central Anatolia,the dead were portrayed in art as headless matchstick men, often seen in thecompany of vultures. These are carrion or scavenger birds associated with theprocess of excarnation, the deliberate defleshing of human carcasses, whichoften took place on wooden mortuary towers, the remaining bones being afterwardcollected for what is known as a secondary, or disarticulated, burial.Excarnation is certainly considered to have taken place during the Neolithic ageand might even have occurred at Göbekli Tepe, according to Klaus Schmidt. Hecompares its large enclosures to the Towers of Silence that feature in thefunerary practices of the religion known as Zoroastrianism,1[index_split_058.html#filepos942186] which thrived in Iran, Armenia, and laterIndia (under the name Parsism) until comparatively recent times. Here the deadwere placed at the top of round stone towers, the Towers of Silence, away from acommunity. The vultures would swoop down and pick the carcasses clean, afterwhich the remaining bones were allowed to calcine in the hot sun before beingcollected for final burial.Although such practices are rare today, they do continue under the name skyburials among some remote Tibetan Buddhist communities in the Himalayas.Eyewitness reports show that first the vultures swoop down to devour thecarcasses, then the ravens, hawks, and crows arrive to finish the job, almost asif this honor among birds might be the true origin of the term pecking order.Excarnation almost certainly occurred at Çatal Höyük, where it is depicted on atleast one painted fresco (see figure 9.1). This shows two wooden towers,accessed by a staircase, at the base of which are two figures, guardians perhapsof the charnel area. On top of the right-hand tower vultures attack a headlessmatchstick man, which is very likely an abstract symbol used to represent a deadbody. The head was considered the seat of the soul, and because the soul hasdeparted the body, it is portrayed as headless; that is, soulless. The missinghead is seen in outline on top of the left-hand tower, where two vultures appearto be taking the head, or soul, under their wings.[images/00030.jpg]Figure 9.1. Excarnation towers from a reconstructed panel found at the Neolithiccity of Çatal Höyük, dating to 7500–5700 BC (after James Mellaart). Note thesoul of the deceased depicted as a head, with its denuded body shown as aheadless matchstick man.PSYCHOPOMPThe painting is meant to convey the idea that, even though the human carcassmight suffer the unsightly (although very efficient) act of excarnation, thespirits of the vultures accompany the soul into the afterlife. Each bird is thusacting as a psychopomp, an ancient Greek word meaning “soul carrier,” used todescribe a supernatural being or creature whose role was to assist a newlydeceased soul reach the next world.British archaeologist James Mellaart recorded that all panels connected withdeath and rebirth at Çatal Höyük were located on either the north or east wallsof cult shrines.2 [index_split_058.html#filepos942322] East is clearly thedirection of rebirth, symbolized by the appearance of the sun each morning,leaving the north as the direction of the netherworld, the realm of darkness andthe dead. Indeed, some of the most prominent vulture imagery featuringmatchstick men at Çatal Höyük was placed on the north walls of cult shrines.Not only is the north the only place where, in the Northern Hemisphere, the sunnever reaches, it is also the direction of the Milky Way’s Great Rift, the starsof Cygnus, and, of course, the celestial pole. Was it in this direction, towardthe perceived entrance to the sky world, that the vultures were thought to carryor accompany the soul into the afterlife?Although Cygnus is most often represented in Eurasian star lore as a swan,evidence indicates it was once seen on the Euphrates as Vultur cadens, the“falling vulture,”3 [index_split_058.html#filepos942453] even though this is atitle more commonly associated with the nearby constellation of Lyra.GÖBEKLI’S VULTURE STONERepresentations of vultures were found among the ruins of the cult building atNevalı Çori. Here Harald Hauptmann and his team uncovered a stone totem pole onwhich human heads and vultures are shown together, as well as a beautifullyexecuted sculpture of a vulture that would not look out of place in a modern artgallery. Yet strangely this beautiful piece of art was being used as fill withinthe wall of the cult building, indicating that it belonged to an earlier phaseof building activity, probably ca. 8500–8400 BC.Vultures are also to be seen among the carved art at Göbekli Tepe, mostobviously on Pillar 43. Located in the north-northwestern section of EnclosureD, it stands immediately west of the holed stone that would have allowed aperson crouching between the twin pillars to observe the setting of Deneb duringthe epoch in question.On Pillar 43’s western face are three vultures, one of which is a juvenile. Alsovisible is a scorpion and two long-necked wader birds—flamingos perhaps—andbetween them and the head of the adult vulture in the upper register is a lineof small squares, abutted on each side by a series of V-shapes, possiblysignifying the flow of water.Other strange features are depicted at the top of the stone. Three rectangularforms appear in a line with linked loops that make them resemble handbags. Nextto each is a small creature, which in order, from left to right, can beidentified as a long-legged bird (a wader perhaps), a quadruped (seemingly afeline), and an amphibian (possibly a frog or toad). An interpretation of thisscene is problematic, although the handbags, or “man bags,” as some people arecalling them, are most likely animal pens or houses, situated on what could bethe edge of a river, upon which is a trackway (the lines of squares) underneathwhich flows water (the accompanying V-shapes).This, however, is not why Pillar 43 has been singled out as important. It is thevulture positioned at the end of the line of small squares that draws the eye(see figure 9.2 on p. 100). It stands up, with its wings articulated in a mannerresembling human arms. It also has bent knees and bizarre flat feet, in theshape of oversized clowns’ shoes, indicating that this is very likely a shamanin the guise of a vulture or a bird spirit with anthropomorphic features.Similar vultures with articulated legs are depicted on the walls of shrines atÇatal Höyük, and these too are interpreted either as anthropomorphs or asshamans adorned in the manner of vultures.4 [index_split_058.html#filepos942610]HEAD LIKE A BALLJust above the vulture’s right wing is a carved circle, like a ball or sun disk.Klaus Schmidt interprets this “ball” as a human head, and this is almostcertainly what it is, for on the back of another vulture lower down the registeris a headless, or soulless, figure, just like the examples found in associationwith the vultures and excarnation towers at Çatal Höyük. And we can be sure thatthis “ball” does represent a human head as similar balls are seen in theprehistoric rock art of the region, where their context makes it clear theyrepresent human souls.5 [index_split_058.html#filepos942739] As Anatolianprehistoric rock art expert Muvaffak Uyanik explains:[images/00033.jpg]Figure 9.2. Göbekli Tepe’s Vulture Stone (Pillar 43). Note the scorpion on theshaft, the headless human figure with erect penis on the neck of thevulture-like bird at the base of the shaft, and the ball above the right wing ofthe vulture in the upper register.> In the Mesolithic age [i.e., in the epoch of the Göbekli builders], it was> realized that man had a soul, apart from his body and, as it was accepted that> the soul inhabited the head, only the skull of the human body was buried. We> also know that the human soul was symbolized as a circle and that this symbol> was later used, in a traditional manner, on tomb-stones without inscriptions.6> [index_split_058.html#filepos942891]So the headless figure represents not only the human skeleton but also a deadman whose soul has departed in the form of a ball-like head that is now underthe charge of the vulture, which is itself arguably a bird spirit with humanattributes, a were-vulture, if you like. Clearly, Göbekli Tepe’s Pillar 43—theVulture Stone, as we shall call it—conveys in symbolic form the release of thesoul into the care of the vulture in its role as psychopomp, or soul carrier, onits journey into the afterlife (Schmidt’s suggestion7[index_split_058.html#filepos942991] that the vulture is playing with a humanhead as part of some macabre game is simply inadequate to explain what is goingon here).VULTURE WINGSEvidence of vulture-related shamanism has been found also at other sites acrossthe region. For instance, during the 1950s at an open-air settlement called ZawiChemi Shanidar, which overlooks the Greater Zab River in the Zagros Mountains ofnorthern Iraq, American archaeologists Ralph and Rose Solecki discovered thewings of seventeen large predatory birds, along with the skulls of at leastfifteen goats and wild sheep.Among the species of bird represented by the bones, many of them stillarticulated, were the bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus) and griffon vulture(Gyps fulvus), as well as various species of eagle. They were found positionedby the wall of a stone structure, which probably served a cultic function.8[index_split_058.html#filepos943254] The excavators were in no doubt that thewings had been severed from the birds at the point of death and worn as part ofa ritualistic costume.9 [index_split_058.html#filepos943451] In other words,shamans utilized these wings as “ritual paraphernalia”10[index_split_058.html#filepos943620] in order to adopt the guise of the vulturein its role as a primary symbol of the cult of the dead.The wings were radiocarbon dated to 8870 BC (+/- 300 years),11[index_split_058.html#filepos943797] although modern forms of recalibration (dueto recent reassessments of the amount of carbon-14 present in organic matterduring former ages) means they probably date to the end of the Younger Dryasperiod, ca. 9600 BC12 [index_split_058.html#filepos943963]; that is, shortlybefore the construction of the large enclosures at Göbekli Tepe, which as thecrow flies is about 280 miles (450 kilometers) west of Zawi Chemi Shanidar.STAR MAP IN STONEIf Göbekli Tepe’s Vulture Stone does show a human soul being accompanied intothe afterlife by a psychopomp in the likeness of a vulture, then there has to bea chance that its rich imagery contains themes of a celestial nature. Scholarsworking in the field of archaeoastronomy have been quick to point out that thescorpion shown at the base of the shaft could signify the constellationScorpius.13 [index_split_058.html#filepos944140] Certainly, in Babylonianastronomical texts such as those found on the Mul-Apin tablets, the stars ofScorpius are identified with a constellation named Scorpion (MULGIR.TAB).14[index_split_058.html#filepos944295]In the cosmological art of the Maya in Central America, a scorpion is oftenshown at the base of the world tree (see figure 9.3), a symbol interpreted bysome scholars as the Milky Way standing erect on the horizon. This has led tothe scorpion being identified with the constellation Scorpius, which liesimmediately beneath the Milky Way’s Great Rift.15[index_split_058.html#filepos944504] Thus it is conceivable that there existed auniversal identification of the stars of Scorpius with the symbol of a scorpionthat originated in the Paleolithic age, the reason it appears on Göbekli Tepe’sVulture Stone, carved ca. 9500–9000 BC.CYGNUS AS A VULTUREIf Pillar 43’s scorpion does represent the Scorpius constellation and is thussymbolizing the point of crossing between the ecliptic and the Milky Way’s GreatRift, then the vulture with articulated wings and clownlike feet at the top ofthe stone completes the cosmic picture. Its wings, head, neck, and body have afamiliar ring to them, for they form a near perfect outline of the Cygnusconstellation, with the vulture’s head in the position of Deneb and itsoutstretched wings matching those of its celestial counterpart as it appeared11,500 years ago (see figure 9.4). This identification with Cygnus, first notedby Professor Vachagan Vahradyan of the Russian-Armenian (Slavonic) University,16[index_split_058.html#filepos944677] is remarkable and unlikely to becoincidence.Thus the abstract imagery on Pillar 43, with its headless matchstick man next tothe scorpion, and the ball-like head above the left wing of the vulture,probably shows the transmigration of the soul from its terrestrial environment,signified by the stars of Scorpius at the base of the Milky Way’s Great Rift, toits final destination in the region of the Cygnus constellation at the top ofthe Great Rift.[images/00036.jpg]Figure 9.3. Mayan cosmic tree, symbol of the Milky Way, with a scorpion by itsbase perhaps signifying the constellation Scorpius.[images/00038.jpg]Figure 9.4. Göbekli Tepe’s Vulture Stone (Pillar 43) with the Cygnusconstellation overlaid.[images/00040.jpg]Figure 9.5. The Milky Way’s Great Rift overlaid with the scorpion and vulturefrom Göbekli Tepe’s Vulture Stone (Pillar 43), showing their match with,respectively, the stars of Scorpius when just above the western horizon and, atthe same time, Cygnus (the vulture) as it crosses the meridian high in the sky.Absolute confirmation of this pictorial journey into the afterlife comes fromthe fact that in 9500 BC, when Scorpius came into view on the western horizonshortly after sunset, the Milky Way’s Great Rift would have stretched upwardinto the night sky to highlight Cygnus as it crossed the meridian on its uppertransit at an elevation of approximately 70 degrees. It is almost certainly thisrelationship between the two constellations that is depicted on Göbekli Tepe’sVulture Stone, especially as the pillar’s clown-footed vulture and scorpion arein similar positions to their celestial counterparts (see figure 9.5).The fact that Enclosure D’s Vulture Stone is also in the north-northwest, nextto the holed stone and on the same basic alignment as its twin pillars, isanother potential clue as to its astronomical function, in particular itsconnection with Cygnus and the Milky Way’s Great Rift. Yet how exactly did theGöbekli builders envision the sky world, which seems to have been intrinsicallylinked to the symbol of the vulture? The greatest clue comes from the holedstone, which, as we have seen, probably acted as a seelenloch, or soul hole,through which the soul had to pass in order to reach its otherworldlydestination."},{"pageContent":"10COSMIC BIRTH STONEIf the twin monoliths at the center of Göbekli Tepe’s Enclosure D were onceoriented toward the setting of Deneb in the epoch of their construction, then,as we have seen, a person standing or crouching between them would have beenable to view this astronomical spectacle through a holed stone locatedimmediately east of the Vulture Stone. It would have been a similar case inEnclosure C, where the entrant would also have been able to witness the settingof Deneb through the aperture of a holed stone (Pillar 59) when positionedbetween the twin central pillars.It is time now to better understand the purpose of these holed stones, focusingour attentions on the example in Enclosure D, which remains in situ. It hascarved parallel lines that curve around the hole to form what appear to be naïverenderings of human legs bent at the knee. After coming together beneath thehole the “legs” trail off toward the bottom right-hand corner of the stone,leaving a parallel opening between the knee and the presumed ankles. That thetwin sets of parallel lines represent legs, and not something else, is confirmedby the fact that the lower left-hand edge noticeably bulges as if to signify theperson’s right-hand buttock (see figure 10.1).[images/00043.jpg]Figure 10.1. Left, decorated holed stone in the north wall of Göbekli Tepe’sEnclosure D. Note the lines flowing around the hole, suggestive of an abstractfemale form. Right, the broken holed stone in a similar position in Enclosure C.THE KILISIK STATUEIf the incised lines on the sighting stone do show a pair of legs bent at theknees, then the large hole directly above them can only signify one thing—theperson’s, or should I say the woman’s, vulva. A similar hole is seen on the miniT-shaped statue found in 1965 at Kilisik, a village in Adıyaman province, some46.5 miles (75 kilometers) north-northwest of Göbekli Tepe.1[index_split_058.html#filepos945132] In addition to having arms and hands, likethe T-shaped pillars at Göbekli Tepe and Nevalı Çori, the statue has anadditional line that rises at an angle on both its wide faces to meet the handson the front narrow face. It seems clear that the figure is lifting up itsgarment to expose its belly and genitalia (see figure 10.2).Strangely, the belly or womb area of the statue is sculpted into a much smallerhuman form represented by a crude head, body, and arms, executed in a stylereminiscent of a macabre stone totem pole unearthed at Göbekli Tepe and now inŞanlıurfa’s archaeological museum. This too shows smaller human forms in theposition of the womb or stomach of a much larger standing figure (see plate 24[index_split_031.html#filepos435608]).The small figure on the Kilisik statue very likely represents a fetus inside awoman’s womb, the large incised hole immediately beneath the belly emphasizingnot just the position of the vulva but also the birth canal. That a verysimilar, although much larger hole, has been bored through Enclosure D’spotential sighting stone, which is itself surrounded by incised lines arguablysignifying the legs of a woman, suggests this hole is also an exaggerated vulva(presumably the holed stone at the same position in Enclosure C played a similarrole).[images/00046.jpg]Figure 10.2. Stone statue of a T-shaped figure found in 1965 at Kilisik inAdıyaman province, some 46.5 miles (75 kilometers) from Göbekli Tepe. Note thehole forming the figure’s vulva and the small human figure carved into thestomach area.This means that when in 9400 BC the setting of Deneb aligned with the hole inthe sighting stone in Enclosure D, the star’s presence would have been framedwithin the abstract woman’s vulva. Clearly, this carefully executedsynchronization between star and stone was created to mark the moment ofalignment with the opening of the Milky Way’s Great Rift in its role as thesuspected entrance to the sky world, where souls departed to in death and,presumably, emerged from at birth. We can go further, for the angle made by thewoman’s lower legs, as they trail off toward the right-hand corner of the stone,is similar to the angle of the Milky Way and Great Rift when the star Deneb isat approximately 45 degrees in elevation. In other words, the manner ofplacement of the woman’s legs seems to emphasize that her vulva marks theentrance to the Great Rift (see figure 10.3).So if the abstract female form seen on the holed stone in Enclosure D symbolizesthe Cosmic Mother, is the purpose of the synchronization between star and stoneto indicate that she is about to give birth? Should this surmise prove correct,there can be little doubt that this was a highly symbolic act seen to take placeboth in a material sense within the womblike enclosure, and in a celestial form,with the cosmic child imagined as emerging into life from the opening of theGreat Rift (exactly like the rebirth of the solar god One Hunahpu in Mayan mythand legend). In this manner, the cosmic child would have been seen to come forthfrom Cygnus, then descend the Great Rift to the “ground”; that is, the horizon,where the ecliptic, the sun’s path, crossed the Milky Way in the vicinity of thestars of Sagittarius and Scorpius.COSMIC BIRTHAlmost exactly what we see represented in abstract form on the sighting stone inGöbekli Tepe’s Enclosure D is found also on the Venus and Sorcerer panel insideFrance’s Chauvet Cave, which, as we have seen, was created by Upper Paleolithiccave artists some thirty-two thousand years ago. Here too the abstract legs ofthe “Venus” seem to signify the twin streams of the Milky Way on either side ofthe Great Rift, with the head of a young bovine overlaid upon the position ofthe womb (see figure 6.3 below). In this context, the bucranium likelyrepresents the Cygnus constellation in its role as the head of a bull calf,which in prehistoric times was seen as an abstract symbol of the female womb oruterus, complete with its hornlike fallopian tubes (see figure 10.4 on p. 110).The uncanny resemblance between the two is something our ancestors would appearto have realized at a very early stage in human development,2[index_split_058.html#filepos945268] making the bucranium, and the bull calf ingeneral, primary symbols of birth and death in the Neolithic age.[images/00049.jpg]Figure 10.3. Göbekli Tepe’s Enclosure D, showing the location of the holedsighting stone in its perimeter wall. Note the Milky Way’s Great Rift on thehorizon.We are reminded also of the 3-D frescoes from Çatal Höyük showing bulls beingborn from between the legs of divine females (who have the heads of leopards),and the ancient Egyptian belief that the goddess Hathor, in her role as theMilky Way, gave birth each morning to the sun god in the form of a bull calf.The cult of Hathor was virtually synonymous with that of Nut, the sky goddess,who was herself a personification of the Milky Way, her womb and vulva occupiedby the stars of Cygnus (see figure 10.5 on p. 110).3[index_split_058.html#filepos945418]Nut was the mother of Osiris, the god of death and resurrection, and also of Re,the sun-god, who was reborn each morning from between her loins. In death, thepharaoh would assume the identity of Osiris and reenter the womb of his mother,Nut, in order to reach an afterlife among the stars. In other words, as theresurrected god Osiris the deceased would return from whence he or she had comeoriginally, which was the Milky Way’s Great Rift in the vicinity of the Cygnusconstellation.[images/00051.jpg]Figure 10.4.

Ancient Egyptian sky goddess Nut in her role as a personificationof the Milky Way, with the stars of Cygnus marking her womb and vulva, and theGreat Rift signifying the gap between her legs (after R. A. Wells).BIRTH CHAMBERHow exactly the entrants to Göbekli Tepe’s Enclosure D, or indeed its neighbor,Enclosure C, might have celebrated the act of cosmic birth is open tospeculation. Perhaps the new soul was believed to emerge from the opening of theGreat Rift and then in some unimaginable manner enter a pregnant woman waitingbetween the enclosure’s twin pillars. A ritual act like this might have takenplace either at the point of conception, sometime during pregnancy, or, perhaps,shortly before birth. It might even be that some births actually took placebetween the enclosure’s central pillars, mimicking exactly what the incisedlines on the holed stone were attempting to convey.So not only were the enclosures at Göbekli Tepe built to honor the departure ofthe soul in the company of the vulture in its role as psychopomp (remember, theVulture Stone is next to Enclosure D’s holed stone or Cosmic Birth Stone, as weshall call it), but they were also designed to bring forth new life. Presumablysouls entering the world would be accompanied by a psycho-pomp in the guise of abird, most probably the vulture, which in some painted panels uncovered at ÇatalHöyük is shown with an oval inside its back containing a human baby. Today, inmany parts of Europe and Asia newborn babies are accompanied into the world bythe stork. Yet in the Baltic (and seemingly in Siberia4[index_split_058.html#filepos945552]) a white swan replaces the stork.5[index_split_058.html#filepos945701] Clearly, in these areas of the globe, theswan or stork plays the same role as the vulture once did in the Near East.In Egyptian and Hindu myth, a primordial goose or swan brought forth theuniverse with its call, although in many countries the swan was said to havelaid the egg that either formed the universe or became the sun (such as TündérIlona, the Hungarian fairy goddess, who “when she was changed into the shape ofa swan” laid an egg in the sky that became the sun6[index_split_058.html#filepos945823]). This once again ties in with the beliefthat cosmic creation takes place in the vicinity of the Cygnus constellation andGreat Rift, resulting in the rebirth of the sun each day.COSMOLOGICAL BELIEFSEverything points toward Enclosure C and Enclosure D’s holed stones being notjust confirmation of Deneb’s place in the mind-set of the Göbekli builders butalso of the site’s role as a place where the rites of birth, death, and rebirthwere celebrated both in its carved art and within the architectural design ofits larger enclosures, which formed symbolic wombs complete with twin souls andaxes mundi.The Göbekli builders would appear to have used the holed stones as seelenloch toenter an otherworldly environment associated with both the act of cosmic birthand the creation of human souls, which came forth from there prior to childbirthand returned there in death. During their ecstatic and altered states ofconsciousness, shamans at Göbekli Tepe perhaps believed they were to become asfetuses in order to reenter the cosmic womb, the source of primordial creation,an act integrally associated with the star Deneb and the Milky Way’s Great Rift.Further confirmation of the holed stones’ function as symbolic vulva is found inthe work of scholars attempting to understand the cosmic design of megalithicdolmens, which, as we know, often have circular holes in their entrance façades.The burials found inside them are often placed in fetal positions ready for newlife, leading to theories that the stone structures are symbolic wombs or uteri,their portholes representing the vulva, prompting one expert on the origins ofJudaism and Islam to observe that whosoever “enters or leaves a dolmen [throughthe hole “drilled with enormous effort”] does this in the posture of a child atdelivery through the vagina. The burial-dolmen itself is therefore symbolicallya uterus.”7 [index_split_058.html#filepos945968]These are incredible revelations that entirely alter our current perceptions ofthe mind-set of those behind the creation of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic world insoutheast Anatolia. Yet as we see in part three, such cosmological thinkingpales into insignificance when compared with other major factors that might wellhave been behind the creation of Göbekli Tepe’s main enclosures. For it seemslikely that monumental architecture on this scale was built in response tosomething terrible that had happened in the world."},{"pageContent":"PART THREECatastrophobia[images/00125.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"11THE HOODED ONESUp to twelve T-shaped pillars stood in rings within Göbekli Tepe’s largeenclosures, all with their faceless gaze focused toward the central monoliths,as if they formed part of some kind of otherworldly gathering of a secretsociety. For when we come to ask why the human form is being portrayed withT-shaped terminations both here and at other Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites acrossthe region, with the best answer being that they represent individuals withheads that are long and narrow (hyper-dolichocephalic) who also wear cowls, orhoods, that extend to the rear, as if they might cradle a full head of hair.It is a conclusion strengthened in the knowledge that the life-size statue of amale uncovered during urban development on Yeni Yol Street in Şanlıurfa’sBalıklıgöl district in 1993, has a regular face and head, as do the variousportable statues found at Göbekli Tepe and Nevalı Çori. So the sculptors of thePre-Pottery Neolithic world knew very well how to create perfect representationsof the human form with all its intricacies. Clearly then, the T-shaped pillarsare abstract representations of those remembered as having once looked this way,their blank expressions confirming their otherworldliness, or transcendentalnature.[images/00057.jpg]Figure 11.1. An example of hooded figures in a circle, like the T-shaped pillarsat Göbekli Tepe. Here three men perform a type of dance around a piper. Cyprianlimestone carving. Phoenician in origin, date unknown.THE MINI T-SHAPED STATUEThat the T-shaped pillars show long-headed individuals wearing cowls seemsconfirmed by the mini T-shaped statue found in 1965 close to the village ofKilisik, some 46.5 miles (75 kilometers) north-northwest of Göbekli Tepe. Itappears to be wearing a large hood extended at the rear by the peculiar shape ofthe skull; indeed, even the start of the hood can be seen as a straight linethat divides the rear half of the head from the projecting face (see figure10.2).Why exactly these figures are depicted with elongated heads is a matter wereturn to later in this book. Yet why wear hoods or cowls in the first place?Perhaps it was the prevailing climatic conditions, or the fact that theseindividuals needed to protect their skin from the sun’s rays. More likely isthat the cowls convey some idea of status among the communities in which theymoved, a fact suggesting the presence of elitism; in other words, a cleardivision between the Göbekli builders, made up of quarry men, stone masons,flint knappers, hunters, and butchers and those who controlled and managed theconstruction work going on at the site.Having said this, it seems unlikely that the T-shapes reflect the presence ofindividuals living when the main enclosures at Göbekli Tepe were constructedaround 9500–8900 BC. Like saints and divinities represented as carved art inchurches, or the statues of gods and heroes in classical temples, the T-shapesat Göbekli Tepe are perhaps reflections of something that has been. Somethingthat had to be remembered, celebrated, and not forgotten.We cannot know what might have been going at Göbekli Tepe when the largeenclosures were under construction, nor whether the genesis of the T-shapedpillars happened here or elsewhere. It is possible, as Schmidt believes, thatcomplex structures like Enclosures C and D were the pinnacle of a long period ofdevelopment at the site going back many thousands of years. On the other hand,the construction of the monumental enclosures might just as easily have beeninspired by a significant event. Perhaps the arrival in southeast Anatolia ofrepresentatives from another culture—individuals who helped galvanize the localhunter-gathering population into embarking on this mammoth building project.A SUDDEN CHANGE IN LIFESTYLEIs this what really happened in southeast Anatolia sometime either during ordirectly after the Younger Dryas mini ice age, ca. 10,900–9600 BC? Did somegreat change occur in the world of the local hunter-gatherers that culminated inthe construction of the large enclosures at Göbekli Tepe under the guidance ofsome kind of “power elite,”1 [index_split_058.html#filepos946195] as Schmidtrefers to them?Hunter-gatherers would work together in small bands to fulfill their primaryfunctions in life, with these being hunting wild game, foraging for varioustypes of food, and ensuring the well-being and safety of their extended familygroup. They created temporary settlements that they occupied only at certaintimes of the year; for the rest of the time the hunters followed the migrationalroutes of herd animals. They relied on these animals for food; clothes; fat forbalms, fires, and lamps; bone, horn, and antler for weapons, tools, and items ofpersonal adornment; and sinew (thin shredded fibers of muscle tendons) for useas cordage, binding points on arrow shafts, and as a backing material on bows.Epipaleolithic (that is, transitional Paleolithic) hunters used establishedcampsites and work stations, kitted out with basic facilities, before moving onto the next site, and the next site, and so forth, until eventually theyreturned to their original place of departure. This was their cycle of life, andit would have remained so had neolithization not gotten in the way.There can have been no obvious advantage in hundreds, if not thousands, ofpeople (Klaus Schmidt believes that between five hundred and a thousandindividuals were employed in building construction at Göbekli Tepe at any onetime2 [index_split_058.html#filepos946326]) putting aside their free existenceas hunters and foragers and coming together to create monumental architecture onsuch a grand scale. Something must have spurred the regional population intoabandoning their old lives and adopting a completely different way of living,and from the presence in the enclosures of the massive T-shaped pillars, that“something” would appear to have been whoever, or whatever, they represented.Did the T-shapes represent the memory of powerful individuals, great ancestorsperhaps, of those who built Göbekli Tepe?MESSIANIC MESSAGEIf so, then who exactly were these influential figures—the Hooded Ones, as weshall call them until their likely identity is revealed? Did they come asmessianic figures, bringing some sort of message—one that was so clear it couldnot be ignored? Was it believed that something bad would happen to the localhunter-gatherers, their families, and the world around them if this message wereto be ignored?As much as these ideas might seem at odds with our understanding of thePaleolithic mindset, they will begin to make sense of the evidence beinguncovered right now at Göbekli Tepe. This can be seen in the fact that thecontinuous building of sacred enclosures in the same basic style, albeit in agradually declining fashion, across a period of nearly fifteen hundred years,ca. 9500–8000 BC, argues for the presence at the site of a very rigid beliefsystem attached to the erection of the T-shaped pillars. It implies also astrength of conviction that might be compared to the manner in which Christians,adhering to ancient traditions, have steadfastly built churches in the samebasic style across a very similar period of time.The same can be said for the religious houses of other major religions, with themotivation behind these strictly-adhered-to dogmas always being the words,deeds, and legacy of prophets, saints, and messianic figures. Had somethingsimilar been going on at Göbekli Tepe or more particularly in the world thatexisted immediately prior to the construction of its large enclosures?If the Hooded Ones did exist, then what might have been their powerful message,and where did they come from? To even start to answer these questions we need toreturn to the strange symbolism of the T-shaped pillars, in particular thosethat stand proud in the center of Enclosure D, arguably the most accomplishedstructure uncovered so far."},{"pageContent":"12THE FOX’S TAILThe imposing central pillars in Göbekli Tepe’s Enclosure D both sport widebelts, at the front of which, beneath a centrally placed belt buckle, fox-peltloincloths have been carved, the animal’s hind legs and long, bushy tailextending down to knee level (see plate 13[index_split_031.html#filepos431039]). Further emphasizing the easternmonolith’s vulpine character is the presence on its inner face of a leaping fox,something present also on the central pillars of Enclosures B, the easterncentral pillar in Enclosure A, and the western central pillar in Enclosure C.These images of the fox, along with the high level of faunal remains belongingto the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) found at Göbekli Tepe, led archaeozoologist JorisPeters, writing with Klaus Schmidt, to conclude that the interest in this caninecreature went beyond any domestic usage and was connected in some way with the“exploitation of its pelt and/or the utilization of fox teeth for ornamentalpurposes.”1 [index_split_058.html#filepos946672] That this statement was madeeven before the discovery of the fox-pelt loincloths carved on the front narrowfaces of Enclosure D’s central pillars means that what Peters and Schmidt go onto say in the same paper should not be ignored, for in their opinion “a specificworship of foxes may be reflected here.”2 [index_split_058.html#filepos946890]That leaping foxes appear also on the central pillars in the large enclosures atGöbekli Tepe suggests that the entrant passing between them would haveencountered this vulpine creature upon accessing the otherworldly environmentreached through the enclosures’ inner recesses. So why foxes, especially as theyare usually seen in indigenous mythologies as cosmic tricksters, evil twins ofthe true creator god, responsible only for chaos and disarray in the universe?BELT BUCKLE CLUEWas the fox the chosen animal totem of the Hooded Ones, the faceless individualsportrayed by the T-shaped pillars? If the answer is yes, then what does it mean?The key is the strange belt buckle immediately above the fox-pelt loincloth onthe enclosure’s eastern pillar (Pillar 18). A similar belt buckle is seen on thewestern pillar (Pillar 31), although here it is left unadorned, in the same waythat the figure’s belt, in complete contrast to the one worn by its easterncounterpart, is completely devoid of any glyphs or ideograms.Only on the eastern pillar does the belt buckle reveal something verysignificant indeed. It shows a glyph composed of a thick letter U that cupswithin its concave form a large circle from which emerge three prongs that standupward (see figure 12.1 and plate 13 [index_split_031.html#filepos431039]). Thatthis emblem is worn centrally, on a belt festooned with strange ideograms,suggests that it has a very specific function. If so, then what might this havebeen?THREE-TAILED COMETHaving examined the belt buckle glyph at some length, it is the author’s opinionthat it represents the principal components of a comet. The circle is its head,or nucleus, and the U-shape is the bow shock that bends around the leading edgeof the nucleus and trails away as the halo. The upright prongs denote threeseparate tails, with multiple tails being a common feature of comets (see figure12.2).That the comet’s “tails” on the belt buckle stand upward also makes sense, forthese are often seen to trail into the night sky as the comet reachesperihelion. This is its final approach and slingshot orbit around the sun. Asthis takes place the solar magnetic fields cause the gaseous particles of thecomet to point away from the sun, so when the comet is seen in the sky, eitherin the predawn light (before perihelion) or, alternatively, just after sunset(following perihelion), its tail or tails point upward from the horizon,creating an unforgettable sight (see figure 12.3).[images/00060.jpg]Figure 12.1. The belt on Enclosure D’s eastern central pillar (Pillar 18)showing its belt buckle device and fox-pelt loincloth.[images/00063.jpg]Figure 12.2. Left, comet showing the bow shock around its leading edge and,right, Halley’s Comet in 1910. Both resemble elements of Pillar 18’s beltbuckle.[images/00066.jpg]Figure 12.3. The Great Comet of 1861 showing its triple tail.The idea that the belt buckle glyph shows a comet is strengthened by itssimilarity to three-tailed comets seen in an ancient Chinese silk text. TheMawangdui cometary atlas (also known as the Book of Silk), created ca. 300–200BC and named after the Han Dynasty mound tomb in which it was discovered in the1970s, lists, in all, twenty-nine different cometary forms and the disastersassociated with them. In figure 12.4, we see that in more than one example thereis a striking resemblance to the Göbekli Tepe belt buckle design, especially asthe comets are drawn with their tails pointing upward.3[index_split_058.html#filepos946990]MARK OF THE COMETYet even assuming that the belt buckle glyph does show a comet, could this notsimply be a personal device without any connection to the function of GöbekliTepe? This appears unlikely, as the pillar is festooned with ideograms of aprobable celestial nature. The belt’s C and H glyphs would appear to havecosmological values, as does the carved eye held within a slim crescent wornaround the “neck” of the T-shaped monolith. In addition to this, it does seem asif Enclosure D’s eastern central pillar has a greater function than its westernneighbor, almost as if one twin is alive, while the other functions as a ghostor echo of the other.[images/00069.jpg]Figure 12.4. The Chinese Mawangdui atlas (or Book of Silk) from ca. 300– 200 BC,showing the entry for the various different types of comet, some resembling thebelt buckle on Göbekli Tepe’s pillar.Regardless of these facts Pillar 18’s belt buckle is simply not enough todemonstrate that comets held some special importance at Göbekli Tepe. There is,however, another tantalizing link between the symbol of the comet and EnclosureD—this being the fox-pelt loincloths seen beneath the belt buckle on bothmonoliths. Universally the fox, and the fox tail in particular, has been seen asa metaphor for comets, due to the hairlike appearance of their long tails. Evenin British heraldry the device known as the comet or blazing star is drawn toresemble the fox’s tail (see figure 12.5 on p. 124). It is for this reason thatcomets have occasionally been personified as having clear vulpine and—as weshall see—canine (doglike) and lupine (wolflike) qualities of a dark, forebodingnature.COMETARY CANINESChinese myths and legends, for instance, speak of mountain demons called t’ien-kou (tengu in Japanese), “heavenly dogs.” Folk tradition asserts that thesesupernatural creatures derive their name from comets or meteors falling toearth, for it is said they resemble the tails of dogs or foxes. One accountspeaks of t’ien-kou as:[images/00072.jpg]Figure 12.5. Medieval heraldic device known as the comet or blazing star withits distinctive “fox tail.”> a huge dog with a tail of fire like a comet. Its home was in the heavens, but> it sustained itself by descending to earth every night and seeking out human> children to eat. If it could not catch any children it would attack a human> adult and consume his liver.4 [index_split_058.html#filepos947120]It is this dreaded fear of comets, seen in terms of malevolent supernaturalcreatures in canine form, that brings us to a fascinating account recorded by aSpanish Jesuit priest who journeyed through northern Mexico in 1607–1608. Whilestaying in the town of Parras in the state of Coahuila, Andrés Pérez de Ribas(1576–1655) witnessed the priests of the local tribe, perhaps the TlaxcalanIndians, conduct a powerful and somewhat macabre ceremony to ward off thebaleful influence of a comet (almost certainly it was Halley’s Comet, which madean appearance in 1607). According to him:> The end of the comet (some of them said) was in the form of plumage: others> said it had the form of an animal’s tail. For this reason some came with> feathers on their heads, and others with a lion’s or fox’s tail, each of them> mimicking the animal he represented. In the middle of the plaza there was a> great bonfire into which they threw their baskets [containing dead animals]> along with everything in them. They did this in order to burn up and sacrifice> these things, so they would rise up as smoke to the comet. As a result, the> comet would have some food during those days and would therefore do them no> harm.5 [index_split_058.html#filepos947434]Although this strange ceremony to negate the influence of a comet took place onanother continent nearly ten thousand years after the abandonment of GöbekliTepe, the very specific use of fox (and lion) tails not just to represent thecomet but also to connect with its supernatural nature, cannot be ignored. Thisform of sympathetic magic was the domain of the priest or shaman, and there canbe little question that very similar ceremonies took place on other continentsin past ages.That the twin central pillars of Göbekli Tepe’s Enclosure D both display foxtails, while the eastern example additionally possesses a belt buckle that mightwell show the symbol of a comet, begs the question of whether the Göbeklibuilders might in some way have been concerned by the influence and presence ofcomets in our skies. Moreover, because the comet symbolism only appears in fullon one of the central pillars, was this particular figure seen to have a specialdominion over comets, an ability connected with the proposed message or doctrineintroduced to the hunter-gatherers of southeast Anatolia in the epochimmediately prior to the construction of the first stone enclosures at GöbekliTepe?I PREDICT A COMETIs it possible that this imposing stone figure at the center of Enclosure D,whoever or whatever it represents, was seen to have delivered the means by whichthe Epipaleolithic peoples of southeast Anatolia, with the help of hisshamanicbased elite, could combat the baleful influence of comets? That thehunter-gatherers of southeast Anatolia so readily gave up their nomadiclifestyles to build monumental architecture in an unprecedented manner arguespersuasively that this incoming elite must have had some kind of hold orinfluence over the people. Perhaps they claimed they had direct contact with thesupernatural creature behind the manifestation of comets. If so, then suchclaims would have needed to be backed up with some convincing displays of prooffor the hunter-gatherers to have so readily abandoned their old ways. So whatmight this have been?One realistic answer is that, like the ancient Chinese astrologers behind thecreation of the Mawangdui atlas ca. 300–200 BC, the incoming elite had a veryreal knowledge of comets, which might have included information on periodiccomets, those that make their return within one to two human generations. Aperfect example is Halley’s Comet, which makes its return every seventy-five toseventy-six years (its last appearances were in 1910 and 1986). Indeed, eventhough the gravitational influence of the solar system’s larger planets, such asSaturn and Jupiter, means that the orbit of a short-period comet can fluctuatesomewhat, it is possible that its reappearance might have been calculated tosome degree of accuracy in just a few centuries of observation.It is not known whether Halley’s Comet graced our skies in the tenth or eleventhmillennium BC, although some sources do suggest that it has been in its currentorbit for between sixteen thousand and two hundred thousand years.6[index_split_058.html#filepos947654] So the likelihood of Göbekli Tepe’sfounding elite being able to calculate the return of a short-period comet wastherefore pretty high. If they were able to do this, then using this valuableinformation to their advantage might have been enough to convince thehunter-gathering communities that they had real influence over these fearfulcelestial objects.Such ideas might help explain why Enclosure D’s twin central monoliths wearfox-pelt loincloths, why leaping foxes are present on the inner faces of keycentral pillars at Göbekli Tepe, and why Joris Peters and Klaus Schmidtconsidered that “a specific worship of foxes may be reflected here.” Thesethoughts also perhaps have some bearing on why the large enclosures seem toincorporate symbolism of a clearly celestial and cyclic nature.Is it possible that the enclosures embody a belief, offered by the Hooded Onesand, through them, their lineal descendants (responsible perhaps for thecontinued construction and management of Göbekli Tepe), that by synchronizingthe enclosures with cosmic time cycles it would help provide the builders withenough information to control the influence of comets on a supernatural level?Was it these communities’ absolute fear and loathing of comets that motivatedthem to abandon their old lifestyles to build monumental architecture on such adramatic scale? More pertinently, how did any of this relate to the apparentalignment of the main enclosures at Göbekli Tepe toward the Milky Way’s GreatRift, marked out in the heavens by the star Deneb? These are matters that mustbe addressed next."},{"pageContent":"13COSMIC TRICKSTERIt was the Greek Neoplatonist and celebrated philosopher Proclus of Athens(412–485 AD) who warned that “the fox star nibbles continuously at the thong ofthe yoke which holds together heaven and Earth,”1[index_split_058.html#filepos947998] with German folklore adding that when thefox succeeds, the world will come to an end.2[index_split_058.html#filepos948150] Proclus was referring here to the faintbinary star Alcor, which in Babylonian star lore was known as MULKA.A, the FoxStar.3 [index_split_058.html#filepos948250] In astronomical terms Alcor islocated next to a much brighter quadruple system of binary stars, collectivelyknown under the name Mizar. Together Alcor and Mizar make up the kink in the“handle” of the Plough, or Big Dipper, which forms part of the constellation ofUrsa Major, the Great Bear (see figure 13.1).Some semblance of Alcor’s mythical origin is revealed in Greek star lore, whichtells how the star was once part of the Pleiades, or Seven Sisters, the clusterof seven stars located in the proximity of Taurus, the Bull. According to theGreek writer Hyginus (or one of his pupils writing under his name), a Pleiadenamed Elektra was so distraught at seeing the death of her descendant, KingDardanus, during the fall of Troy, that she withdrew her light and took flightas a “hair star,” a comet, and became Alopex, the Fox, called by the Arabs AlSuha (the “forgotten” or “neglected one”), all names for Alcor.4[index_split_058.html#filepos948384][images/00074.jpg]Figure 13.1. The stars of Ursa Major, or the Big Dipper, as the ancient asterismknown as the Wain, with Alcor in its role as the Fox Star (after Gavin White).TURNING THE HEAVENSEven though there are no astronomical explanations behind these puzzling mythsfeaturing the star Alcor, they do reinforce the connection between the fox, as asymbol of the cosmic trickster, and the destruction of the world caused by theintrusion of a comet, or comets in plural. Why should this have been so? Theanswer seems to lie in the fact that the seven main stars of Ursa Major, whichincludes the Alcor/Mizar combination, were once universally seen as the plow,yoke, mill, handle, wain, or mechanism that quite literally turned the sky poleor world pillar holding up the heavens. This belief came about because the starsof Ursa Major are seen to revolve around the celestial pole in an unerringfashion, a role played by the constellation in every human age, despite the factthat none of its stars ever occupy the position of Pole Star.Proclus’s warning about the Fox Star nibbling “continuously at the thong of theyoke which holds together heaven and Earth” is an allusion to the fox attemptingto sabotage the universe’s turning mechanism, which, of course, was seen to haveits terrestrial point of origin wherever an axis mundi was established on theground. The fox, if allowed to carry out its mischievous deeds, would eventuallybring about the collapse of the imagined sky pole, and with it would follow theend, not just of the world but also of time itself. The fact that Alcor, orAlopex, the Fox Star, was additionally seen as a comet inbound from the Pleiadesis revealing indeed and conjures the idea that as a “hair star” it might havebeen seen as responsible for this perceived cosmic catastrophe.Fox, star, comet, pole, destruction. These are the key elements in this puzzlingenigma of ancient Greek star lore, which might easily have had its origins inancient Mesopotamia, among one of the great civilizations that rose up on thebanks of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers around 3000 BC. Indeed, it is justpossible that certain aspects of this seemingly naïve vision of the cosmos mightreflect something of the proposed strategy adopted by the Epipaleolithichunter-gatherers of southeast Anatolia prior to the construction of GöbekliTepe. Interestingly, Professor Klaus Schmidt compares the leaping foxes carvedon the twin central pillars in the various enclosures at Göbekli Tepe withReynard the Fox, a trickster of French folklore,5[index_split_058.html#filepos948732] as well as with the Mesopotamian Fox StarAlcor, which he says belonged to Enlil, the highest god of the Sumerianpantheon, who was patron also of the ancient city of Nipper in Lower Iraq.6[index_split_058.html#filepos948862]MAN VERSUS DEVILSo if the Fox Star Alcor appears on the inner faces of key central pillarsGöbekli Tepe, why are they aligned toward Cygnus, and not Ursa Major? The answerseems to lie in the fact that there was once a close interrelationship betweenthe Fox Star and the power and influence of Cygnus in its role as guardian ofthe celestial pole.It is a relationship brought out in a complex Romanian sky myth that begins withthe formation of the earth and heavens and leads into a search by humankind tofind the creator. For the journey “the Man” gathers together various tools,objects, and creatures, which are identified with different constellations ofthe night sky. Among the items taken on the journey are “the Great Cross of thechurch” and “the Fountain of the Crossroads,” identified, respectively, asCygnus and the constellation’s bright star Deneb,7[index_split_058.html#filepos948968] the crossroads being a metaphor for boththe axis mundi and the corresponding cosmic axis in the sky.Thereafter, the Man sets off on his voyage and eventually reaches “the middle ofthe Sky’s road,” with the “Sky’s road” being the Milky Way.8[index_split_058.html#filepos949331] Here the Man encounters “He Who Will BeKilled By The Cross.” This is the Devil, identified as the Fox Star, Alcor, whomthe Man fights and eventually defeats.9 [index_split_058.html#filepos949431] Thestory implies that in Christian times the mischievous sky fox was transformedinto the Devil himself.RESTORING COSMIC ORDERWhat takes place during the cosmic battle between the Man, as the bearer of theCross, and the Devil, as the Fox Star, seems to relate to the former regainingcontrol of “the cosmic world axis or world tree of other myths,”10[index_split_058.html#filepos949531] after the Devil sends the heavens spinningout of control. Thus the story implies that the Devil, that is, Alcor, is“killed” or stopped by the Man wielding the Cross, which is Cygnus in its roleas guardian of the “cosmic world axis.”This restoration of cosmic order is achieved, however, only after chaos andmayhem have taken place, for we are told that once the “brave Man” beganfighting with the Devil, their battle “created a great storm beneath the Sky,called by us on Earth ‘the rabid wind.’”11 [index_split_058.html#filepos949632]There are no indications of what this “great storm” or “rabid wind” might havebeen, although it clearly implies some sort of mass upheaval in the heavens,which either affected the earth or was witnessed from the ground.It seems feasible that this Romanian sky myth reflects the role played atGöbekli Tepe by Cygnus, and Deneb in particular. The leaping foxes on thepillars, along with the fox-pelt loincloths on the central monoliths ofEnclosure D, certainly suggest there was some connection between the Fox StarAlcor as the cosmic trickster and the area of sky toward which the pillars weredirected, in other words the Cygnus star Deneb. These precision alignmentstoward the perceived opening to the upper world enabled the shaman or astraltraveler immediate access to the sky realms. Beyond here, in otherworldly terms,would have been a world inhabited by a whole host of strange creatures. Theywould have been seen to roam freely within this sky world and could thus beencountered during vision quests or shamanic journeys made during altered statesof consciousness. Many of these sky creatures, denoted by stars and star groupsspread out along the Milky Way, are almost certainly represented in carvedrelief on the T-shaped pillars at Göbekli Tepe.Yet for these people living in southeast Anatolia during the tenth millennium BCone of the greatest considered threats to the stability of the sky pole orcosmic axis was, it seems, the fox, who as the cosmic trickster had the abilityto create chaos and mayhem—activities that could lead to the collapse of the skypole and the destruction of the world. It is almost certainly for this reasonthat the fox appears on the inner faces of the pillars at Göbekli Tepe, whichSchmidt was probably correct to identify with the Fox Star Alcor. Very likelythe foxes shown within the bent arms of the anthropomorphic figures representedby the twin pillars—particularly those in Enclosure D, who wear the fox feltloincloths—are displaying absolute control over the trickster influence of thesky fox, whose astronomical form is the Fox Star, Alcor.In the Romanian sky myth quoted above, the shaking of the heavens is all thatresults from the Man battling against the Fox Star Alcor in its form as theChristian Devil. However, this perceived threat from the heavens multipliesexponentially when we realize that it is not just the fox that can cause cometsto bring about world destruction but also the wolf, a much more dangerouscreature by far."},{"pageContent":"14FROM A FOX TO A WOLFIn the star lore of Estonia, on the Baltic coast of Northern Europe, we againencounter Alcor, the Fox Star, although now its zoomorphic form has changed tothat of the wolf (bar in Estonian). As the Wolf Star it stands alongside the Ox,or Bull, identified with the nearby star Mizar.1[index_split_058.html#filepos949812] Once again they constitute the kink of the“handle” of the Big Dipper, or Plough, which in Estonia is known as the GreatWain (that is, a cart or wagon).Slovenian star lore tells the story of Saint Martin, who uses the Great Wain(Ursa Major) to carry a great pile of logs.2[index_split_058.html#filepos949949] Along comes the mischievous Wolf (Alcor),who proceeds to kill the Ox (Mizar) and break the vehicle’s shaft. The saintrepairs the Wain and, as punishment, harnesses the Wolf to the Ox in order tomake the animal take the load. Yet the Wolf does nothing more than pull the cartbackward.THE CESSATION OF COSMIC TIMEOnce more the star Alcor, here in the guise of the Wolf, is seen to interferewith the turning mechanism of the heavens, symbolized in this instance by theshaft of the Wain. Not only this, but he also disrupts the natural order of theheavens by dragging the wagon backward, an allusion to the collapse or reversalof time. Clearly, in European star lore the figure of the sky wolf wasinterchangeable with that of the sky fox.The harnessing of the Wolf (Alcor) by Saint Martin is simply a variation of theRomanian sky myth in which the Man defeats the Devil to restore cosmic order.Clearly, the wolf, the fox, and the Devil play nearly identical roles in thismyth cycle, with the human intercession being necessary to prevent any kind ofcatastrophe taking place (the role played by the shaman at Göbekli Tepe).Saint Martin’s feast day is November 11, when swans and geese are roasted andeaten across Europe. The date corresponds also to the return of migrating swansand geese from their breeding grounds in the north. Indeed, the idea of swansand geese carrying souls to and from a northerly placed “heaven” played a majorrole in European folklore until fairly recent times, the connection with Cygnusin its capacity as the entrance to the sky world being the obvious next step.3[index_split_058.html#filepos950055] Thus if Saint Martin might be seen as aChristian patron of the Cygnus constellation, then his role in the Slovenian skymyth makes complete sense. Like the Man in the Romanian story, he is the guidingintelligence of the Cygnus constellation in its struggle against the cosmictrickster symbolized by the star Alcor in Ursa Major. More incredibly, thesebeliefs almost certainly go back to a time when the constellation of Ursa Majorrevolved around either Deneb or Delta Cygni in their role as pole stars, ca.16,500–13,000 BC.Yet even if this unprecedented vision of the beliefs and practices of those whoinspired the construction of Göbekli Tepe in the tenth millennium BC is correct,why go to all this trouble in order to avert the baleful influence of comets?What was the real motivation behind all this work and effort, which must havecompletely changed the lifestyles of the hunter-gatherers of the region? Why didanyone at the end of the Upper Paleolithic age live in fear that a sky fox, orindeed a sky wolf, might disrupt the turning mechanism of the heavens and in sodoing bring about the destruction of the world?The answer would seem to be that in the minds of the Göbekli builders, there wasa genuine fear that if they did not do everything in their power to curtail thisperceived threat from the sky, then something bad would happen. Whatever that“something” was, it was so deeply entrenched in the collective psyche of thepeoples of southeast Anatolia that they were willing to abandon their oldlifestyles and adopt new ones in order to deal with the problem.Accepting such a scenario only makes sense if there had already been aterrifying incident involving the sky fox or sky wolf—one that had brought chaosto the world during some former age of humankind. As we see next, a searchthrough the folklore, myths, and legends of the ancient world tells us that justsuch a catastrophe might well have taken place in fairly recent geologicalhistory."},{"pageContent":"15TWILIGHT OF THE GODSIt was the American congressman, popular writer, and amateur scientist IgnatiusDonnelly (1831–1901), most remembered for his best-selling work Atlantis: TheAntediluvian World (1882), who first publicly explored the possibility that acomet impact caused untold devastation on earth during some former geologicalage. More significantly, he thought that humans living at this time might wellhave preserved a memory of this catastrophic event that was passed down throughcountless generations in the form of myths and legends.Donnelly’s theories on a comet impact in recent geological history became thesubject of a book entitled Ragnarök: The Age of Fire and Gravel, published in1883, just one year after Atlantis: The Antediluvian World. It contains myths,legends, stories, and traditions from around the world that preserve chillingaccounts of something immensely bad that happened in our skies, involving thesun, moon, and intruding celestial phenomena. As a result the earth is decimatedby an all-encompassing conflagration, accompanied by noxious clouds, an extendedperiod of darkness, and a subsequent deluge, responsible for putting out thefires and drowning humankind. Invariably, just a few righteous people survive,either by boarding a vessel or by hiding in a cave. Very often the world isrepopulated either by a single family or a couple, usually a brother and sister,who become the progenitors of a new group of humans. Some accounts even speak ofthe survivors erecting great temples as a direct response to what has happened.THE EDDASOne source of material utilized by Donnelly to outline the actions of what hesaw as a rogue comet, or cluster of comets, that brought destruction to theworld, was that preserved by the peoples of Scandinavia and Iceland. Two primarysources are cited—the Prose Edda and Poetic Edda (known also as the Younger Eddaand Elder Edda)—both recorded in their present form by Christian scholars duringthe medieval period. The Prose Edda, attributed to Snorri Sturluson, who livedca. 1178–1241, derives from an Icelandic text known as the Codex Upsaliensis,which dates to the early 1300s, while the Poetic Edda is found in athirteenth-century manuscript, written in Icelandic and known as the CodexRegius.Both Eddas feature a much prophesized event that acted as the climax to the ageof the gods, who are known as the Æsir, or Asa. This catastrophic event isreferred to as Ragnarök, an Old Icelandic word meaning “doom or destruction ofthe gods; the last day, the end of the gods.”1[index_split_058.html#filepos950268] Another variation of the name, Ragnarøkkr,means “twilight of the gods” or “world’s end.”2[index_split_058.html#filepos950435] Put simply, it is the Norse version ofArmageddon, a fatalistic judgment, where key gods actually die fighting hellishmonsters that rise up intent on bringing about the end of the world.So important was the account of Ragnarök to Donnelly’s mounting evidence for acomet impact in some former age of humankind that it provided him with the titlefor his book. As there is today overwhelming scientific evidence to confirm hisforward-thinking conclusions (see chapter 17), it seems appropriate to allow theU.S. congressman’s often poignant comments to set the scene as we review theaccount of Ragnarök as given in the Prose Edda, Donnelly’s own source for theevents described in his book, cited here using the English translation byAmerican author, professor, and diplomat Rasmus Björn Anderson (1846–1936).3[index_split_058.html#filepos950535]THE DEVOURING OF THE SUN AND MOONThe twilight of the gods began, according to the Scandinavian account, after thehuman race had become foul murderers, perjurers, and sinners, shedding eachother’s blood. Humanity’s descent into depravity is a common theme incatastrophe myths that generally stress that divine intervention was necessaryto purge the world of a wicked or evil strain of humanity.Thus the scene is set for the coming destruction, and shortly afterward aterrible sight is seen in the skies—the wolf named Sköll opens its jaws and eatsthe sun. “That is, the Comet strikes the sun, or approaches so close to it thatit seems to do so,”4 [index_split_058.html#filepos950663] was how Donnelly putit.The Edda tells us next how another wolf named Hati Hróðvitnisson (his first namemeans “he who hates, enemy”5 [index_split_058.html#filepos950790]) devours themoon: “and this, too, will cause great mischief. Then the stars shall be hurledfrom the heavens, and the earth shall be shaken so violently that trees will betorn up by the roots, the tottering mountains will tumble headlong from theirfoundations, and all bonds and fetters will be shivered to pieces.”6[index_split_058.html#filepos950919]These words Donnelly saw as describing the appearance of a second comet, itsblazing debris now falling to earth, causing absolute devastation.7[index_split_058.html#filepos951052] There is a hint here also of the looseningof the bonds that hold up the sky pole, or world pillar, preventing the worldfrom falling apart.After this the monster known as the Fenris Wolf, the offspring of the trickstergod Loki, breaks free of his shackles, which had held him firm up to this time(see figure 15.1 on below), prompting Donnelly to comment: “This, we shall see,is the name of one of the comets.”8 [index_split_058.html#filepos951179] Fenrishimself is the father of Sköll and Hati, wolves that pursue and devour the sunand moon.THE MIDGARD SERPENTThe account of Ragnarök continues: “The sea rushes over the earth, for theMidgard-serpent writhes in giant rage, and seeks to gain the land.”9[index_split_058.html#filepos951285] This is a mythical snake that curls aroundthe base of the world tree, known as Yggdrasil, which unites heaven, earth(Midgard), and underworld. The Midgard Serpent is for Donnelly “the name ofanother comet; it strives to reach the earth; its proximity disturbs theoceans.”10 [index_split_058.html#filepos951418] However, once again we can seehere the actions of a terrible monster intent on destroying the physical worldby bringing about the downfall of Yggdrasil, the Norse form of the world pillar.We are told next that the “Fenris-wolf advances and opens his enormous mouth;the lower jaw reaches to the earth and the upper one to heaven, and he wouldopen it still wider had he room to do so. Fire flashes from his eyes andnostrils. The Midgard-serpent, placing himself by the side of the Fenris-wolf,vomits forth floods of poison, which fill the air and the waters.”11[index_split_058.html#filepos951546][images/00077.jpg]Figure 15.1. The Fenris Wolf bound with magical cord, from a seventeenth-centuryIcelandic manuscript in the possession of the Árni Magnússon Institute inIceland. Note the Van River emerging from the creature’s mouth.These then, the Fenris Wolf and the Midgard Serpent, are to be seen as the twoprincipal comets of destruction, side by side, Donnelly suggested, “like Biela’stwo fragments, and they give out poison—the carbureted-hydrogen gas revealed bythe spectroscope.”12 [index_split_058.html#filepos951680]Biela was the name given to a short-period comet first recorded in 1772 andobserved again in 1805. It was not, however, recognized as being the same objectuntil 1822, when Wilhelm von Biela, an army officer from Vienna, finallyidentified it as a periodic comet with an orbit of just 6.6 years. During itsappearance in 1852 the comet split in two, prompting Donnelly’s comment aboutthe two comet fragments moving together.Biela’s comet was never seen again, and presumably it has now broken up intoundetectable pieces that periodically fall to earth as harmless meteors wheneverthe earth passes through the orbit of its remaining fragments. Illustrations ofthe comet after its breakup into two separate fragments make for a very ominouspicture indeed (see figure 15.2), helping us to understand the dread that theappearance of such celestial bodies might have instilled in the peoples offormer ages.After this time the Prose Edda states that “Surt rides first, and before andbehind him flames burning fire. His sword outshines the sun itself. Bifrost (therainbow), as they ride over it, breaks to pieces.”13[index_split_058.html#filepos951808] Surt is said to have been a fire giant,although for Donnelly it is the “blazing nucleus of the comet,”14[index_split_058.html#filepos951942] with swords being common metaphors forcomets. For example, an illustration of comet types in Johannes Hevelius’sCometographia, published in 1668, shows them as swords and daggers of variousshapes and sizes (see figure 15.3 on p. 140).[images/00080.jpg]Figure 15.2. Biela’s comet in 1846, soon after it split in two.THE MONSTROUS REGIMENTThe Prose Edda account reveals next how the monstrous regiment “direct theircourse to the battle-field called Vigrid. Thither repair also the Fenris-wolfand the Midgard-serpent, and Loki with all the followers of Hel, and Hrym withall the frost-giants.”15 [index_split_058.html#filepos952070]For Donnelly this implied that “all these evil forces, the comets, the fire, thedevil, and death, have taken possession of the great plain, the heart of thecivilized land. The scene is located in this spot, because probably it was fromthis spot the legends were afterward dispersed to all the world.”16[index_split_058.html#filepos952204]This is an interesting statement since it supposes that somewhere in the ancientworld there existed a heartland, a place where all these great tragedies wereplayed out and witnessed by those who survived this tumultuous ordeal.BATTLE OF LIGHT AND DARKNESSIt is after this time that the gods, as the defenders of the world, begin tofight back and start to win the day against the hellish terrors, although notwithout casualties on their own side. Heimdal, the guardian of Bifrost Bridge,blows the Gjallarhorn, which had been hidden beneath Yggdrasil. It awakens thegods, allowing the battle of Ragnarök to commence. The sky god Odin takes flightto Mimir’s Well, a sacred pool at the foot of Yggdrasil. Here lurks the head ofhis friend Mimir, which he asks to grant him advice. After that we are told the“ash Yggdrasil begins to quiver, nor is there anything in heaven or on earththat does not fear and tremble in that terrible hour.”17[index_split_058.html#filepos952332] It is a hint once more that the worldpillar is being shaken, tilted even, by the events transpiring both on theground and in the air.[images/00083.jpg]Figure 15.3. A page from Johannes Hevelius’s Cometographia of 1668 showingcomets as daggers and swords.Thereafter, the gods enter Vigrid and engage in battle: “That day the dog Garm,that had been chained in the Gnipa-cave, breaks loose. He is the most fearfulmonster of all, and attacks Tyr, and they kill each other.”18[index_split_058.html#filepos952466] At the same time, the god Thor is able toslay the Midgard Serpent but dies as a consequence of the poisonous venom themonster breathes on him. Inevitably, Donnelly saw Garm, described as abloodstained hound that guards “Hel’s gate,” as alluding to yet another cometfragment.19 [index_split_058.html#filepos952573] Its appearance marks the entryof a fourth canid into the Ragnarök story.THE EARTH SINKSAt this point in the battle Odin takes on the Fenris Wolf but is swallowed bythe monster, which he himself had helped to rear (is this “because Odin had aconnection with wolves?” asks one commentator20[index_split_058.html#filepos952701]). On seeing the death of his father, Odin’sson Víðarr rushes at the beast and, wearing a magic boot prepared specially forthe confrontation, stamps his foot into the Fenris Wolf ’s mouth and holds openits lower jaw. He then uses brute force to pull up on the beast’s jaw, an actionthat brings about its instant demise (see figure 15.4).[images/00085.jpg]Figure 15.4. Shaft of the Gosforth Cross in Cumbria, England, showing Odin’s sonVíðarr killing the Fenris Wolf. Note its knotted serpentine tail.The Fenris Wolf ’s father, Loki, comes up against the god Heimdal, and they killeach other, at which: “Surt flings fire and flame over the world. Smoke wreathesup around the all-nourishing tree (Yggdrasil), the high names play against theheavens, and earth consumed sinks down beneath the sea.”21[index_split_058.html#filepos952847] Once more, this is a clear sign of somekind of global conflagration, as well as an all-encompassing deluge that beginsto engulf the earth, making it appear as if it is sinking beneath the waves.THE FIMBUL-WINTERJust in these few lines we see telltale signs of the aftermath of a majorcataclysm that is set to decimate the earth and everything upon it, a surmiseaffirmed by the fact that the Prose Edda speaks also of the world being plungedinto an age of ice:> The growing depravity and strife in the world proclaim the approach of this> great event. First there is a winter called Fimbul-winter, during which snow> will fall from the four corners of the world; the frosts will be very severe,> the winds piercing, the weather tempestuous, and the sun will impart no> gladness. Three such winters shall pass away without being tempered.22> [index_split_058.html#filepos952981]Donnelly easily recognized these words as describing the onset of a glacial age,following the impact of the comets. This great freeze, which seems to come onquickly, does eventually begin to thaw, as the clouds of darkness disappear anda new sun and moon are born. The floods recede also, leading to a completerenewal of nature.Thereafter emerge the sole human survivors:> During the conflagration caused by Surt’s fire, a woman by name Lif (life) and> a man named Lifthraser lie concealed in Hodmimer’s forest. The dew of the dawn> serves them for food, and so great a race shall spring from them that their> descendants shall soon spread over the whole earth.”23> [index_split_058.html#filepos953088]Donnelly suggested that it was from a cave that Lif and Lifthraser emergedbecause caves feature worldwide in the regeneration of humankind in the wake ofcatastrophes, while the reference to them giving birth to a great “race” impliesthat, in Scandinavian tradition at least, the current human population derivesfrom these two individuals. Others survive the cataclysm as well, includingVíðarr and Vale, the sons of Odin, and Mode and Magne, the sons of Thor. Yetthese are not mortal beings like Lif and Lifthraser. They are offspring of theÆsir, who are destined to dwell on the plains of Ida, where stands the worldtree, Yggdrasil, alongside Mimir’s Well and Asgard, the home of the gods.DONNELLY’S DATESFrom what we read here, it does seem possible that the Eddas, like very similarmyths and legends from around the world, contain echoes of a devastatingcatastrophe that engulfed the world during some distant epoch. Donnellyenvisaged this sequence of events beginning around thirty thousand years ago, atthe height of the last ice age, and culminating around eleven thousand to eightthousand years ago.24 [index_split_058.html#filepos953195] As we shall see, hislater dates correspond pretty well with the proposed timescale of cosmiccatastrophes now believed to have taken place globally toward the end of thelast ice age, triggered by a major impact event around 10,900 BC (see chapter17).Donnelly was convinced that a comet, or indeed a series of comets, wasresponsible for these cataclysms, and once again he was bang on the money, as weshall see soon enough. His proposal that these global killers were portrayed inancient myths and legends as supernatural creatures of the earth and sky alsoseems to be right, a theory advanced since that time by a number of differentcatastrophists, who have each put a unique spin on the subject.NUCLEAR WINTERIn the Ragnarök account, various monsters are cited as being responsible fordestruction in this world, including the Midgard Serpent, the fire giant Surt,and at least four canids, three of them wolves. Two of the wolves are accused ofhaving swallowed the sun and moon, and this quite possibly describes thetemporary disappearance of the heavenly bodies that would inevitably follow acatastrophe of this scale. A comet or asteroid impacting the earth would createunimaginable clouds of smoke, dust, and microparticles of various kinds thatwould be thrust into the upper atmosphere, creating what is known as a nuclearwinter, a total blackout of available light. This debris, which would probablyremain airborne for some considerable length of time, would be joined by a thicklayer of toxic ash produced by the intense firestorms that would engulf entireregions of the planet in the days, weeks, and months after the initial event.To our ancestors this period of absolute darkness might have led them to assumethat the sky wolves, in other words, the comet fragments, had quite literallydevoured the sun and moon. Clearly, the lack of any sunlight heating up theplanet would have resulted in an immediate drop in temperature, helping totrigger the onset of an ice age in a matter of days. Indeed, it would havehappened in a manner quite similar to that portrayed in Roland Emmerich’sdisaster movie The Day After Tomorrow (2004). Although fiction, this filmadequately shows what would happen under such severe weather conditions and howquickly our world would be turned on its head by an initial catastrophe ofglobal consequences.The effect of all this would have been to bring humankind to its knees as itstrived to survive from day to day, all this being “caused” by the intrusioninto their midst of perceived supernatural creatures, including deathly serpentsand terrifying sky wolves that could quite literally swallow the sun and moonwhole.It must have been an unimaginably frightening time to live in. Never would thisdreadful age be forgotten; nor should it be forgotten. As Donnelly so aptly putit:> What else can mankind think of, or dream of, or talk of for the next thousand> years but this awful, this unparalleled calamity through which the race has> passed?> A long-subsequent but most ancient and cultivated people, whose memory> has, for us, almost faded from the earth, will thereafter embalm the great> drama in legends, myths, prayers, poems, and sagas; fragments of which are> found to-day dispersed through all literatures in all lands.25> [index_split_058.html#filepos953327]The peoples of Northern Europe almost certainly preserved their memory of this“unparalleled calamity” in their accounts of Ragnarök. Its existence helpsstrengthen the case for canids—wolves, hounds, and foxes—being seen by ourancestors not just as dangerous cosmic tricksters with the power to bring aboutdeath and destruction but also as outright enemies of the world pillar, or skypole, that connects this world with both the underworld and sky world. Yet as wesee next, these myths existed not only in “legends, myths, prayers, poems, andsagas”26 [index_split_058.html#filepos953434] handed down from some forgottenage. They lingered on in fragmentary sky lore that once again reveals the greatthreat that the sky wolves were seen to pose in destabilizing everything that wehave ever held dear in this world."},{"pageContent":"16THE WOLF PROGENYThe dual relationship between order and chaos in the heavens is highlighted inthe “magnificent song of Eirek,” ca. 950 AD, which has the Norse god Odin say:“Evermore the wolf, the grey one, gazes on the throne of the gods,” an allusionto the Pole Star, which in Anglo-Saxon tradition was the “divine seat where thenorth star Tir (or Tyr) . . . ‘never flinches.’”1[index_split_058.html#filepos953610]There is a strange echo of this scenario in the Scandinavian story of Ragnarök.The main battle is most often described with Odin coming up against Loki’s son,the Fenris Wolf, and losing his life, and then how Odin’s son Víðarr is finallyable to kill the demonic creature. However, less attention is paid to the storyof the Germanic, Old English, and Norse war god named Tíw, Týr, or Tir. He iswilling to sacrifice his life to ensure the safety of humankind by placing hisarm in the Fenris Wolf ’s jaws after the gods had asked the beast to try onvarious fetters, or shackles, to test his strength against them, the realpurpose being to trick Fenris into bondage so that he could never wreak havoc inthe world (see figure 16.1).Fenris was easily able to break free of two sets of fetter, the second one twiceas strong as the first. Yet he becomes suspicious when he sees the next fetter,which seems to be little more than a silk ribbon. So to make sure this is not aruse, Fenris asks one of the gods to step forward and put his arm in his mouth.Tíw agrees to do so, after which the wolf is bound.[images/00002.jpg]Figure 16.1. Helmet plate die from Torslunda on Oland in Sweden showing theNorse god Tíw binding the Fenris Wolf, seventh century AD .Of course, it is a trick, as the silk ribbon has been forged by dark elves fromsix different magical substances, which when combined make an utterlyunbreakable fetter. Once the Fenris Wolf realizes he has been tricked, he bitesoff Tíw’s right arm.Although simply a tale, it is a story containing much deeper symbolism relatingto the stability of the world, and in particular the world pillar. In the Norsemagical alphabet known as the runes, Tíw is represented by the T-rune namedTiwaz. It is composed of an upright pole at the top of which are two downwardturned lines that show the rune to be an arrow. The Tiwaz rune is popularlyconsidered to be a representation of the “vault of heaven held up by theuniversal column,”2 [index_split_058.html#filepos954004] as well as theIrminsul, the “world column” of the Saxons, that “has its heavenly terminationin the pole star.”3 [index_split_058.html#filepos954128] (See figure 16.2.)[images/00034.jpg]Figure 16.2. Left, the German world pillar known as the Irminsul and, right, theTiwaz rune, showing its likeness to the world pillar.This identification fits well with Tíw’s role as personification of the NorthStar, suggesting that originally he was the genius loci, or guardian spirit, ofthe axis mundi, protecting it against attacks by adversaries such as the FenrisWolf. Even though Tíw is killed by the helldog Garm in the Prose Edda renditionof Ragnarök, in the Poetic Edda this act is never fulfilled—Tíw’s earliersacrifice for his warriors and humanity permitting him the title “Leavings ofthe Wolf ”4 [index_split_058.html#filepos954233]; in other words, the one thatthe wolf left alone, that is, didn’t kill.SAVIOR OF THE WORLDTíw was a very early sky god. His name is thought to derive from the same routeas deus, or dei, meaning “god,”5 [index_split_058.html#filepos954461] althoughhe is also the “hanged” god. This suggests he is to be seen as some kind ofsavior who fought and won the battle against the cosmic trickster in the guiseof a supernatural wolf, when it attacked the world pillar and almost broughtabout the destruction of not only the Æsir gods, but also humankind, an abstractmemory, seemingly, of a very real comet impact event in some former age.In Nordic folklore the twin streams formed by the Milky Way’s Great Rift, in thevicinity of Cygnus, have been identified as the “two streams of saliva” thatfall from the Fenris Wolf ’s jaws, one named Wil, the other called Wan, or Van,known also as “Hell’s stream” or the “road of the dead”6[index_split_058.html#filepos954630] (see figure 15.1 on p. 138). Fenris’salternative name, Vanargandr, actually means monster guardian of the River Van,7[index_split_058.html#filepos954760] so there is tantalizing evidence that thewolf was linked in some manner with the Milky Way’s Great Rift, and through thisto the celestial pole and axis mundi, from which the monster was finally able tobreak free of his bonds to wreak havoc in the world.BLACK DOGAnd the Fenris Wolf was not the only supernatural canid of European folklore tohave been perceived as a threat to the stability of the world pillar. Ukrainiansky lore relates how the constellation of Ursa Major, which includes the sevenstars making up the Plough or Big Dipper, is a team of horses tethered to aharness and that “every night a black dog tries to bite through the harness, inorder to destroy the world, but he does not achieve his disastrous aim: at dawn,when he runs to drink from a spring, the harness renews itself.”8[index_split_058.html#filepos954905] Since the Big Dipper circles around thecelestial pole, the horses tethered to the sky pole are the method by which theheavens turn. The “black dog” is, of course, the cosmic trickster attempting tobreak the horses free in order to collapse the sky pole and bring about thedestruction of the world.Variations of the Ukrainian sky myth say that the black dog was bound in chainsbeside the constellation of Ursa Minor, the Little Bear, which is the locationof the current Pole Star, Polaris. Here the animal attempts to gnaw through itsshackles, and when this occurs the world will end,9[index_split_058.html#filepos955320] a clear comparison with the actions of theFenris Wolf in Norse sky lore.THE ETERNAL STRUGGLEIn a similar vein, Russian philologist Dr. Vyacheslav Ivanov wrote that theeternal struggle against the dragon in Slavonic folklore derives from a mucholder tradition in which heroic blacksmiths were able to bind and chain “aterrible dog.” Ivanov goes on to say that “over the whole territory of Eurasia,this mythological complex is associated . . . with the Great Bear . . . (and)with a star near it as a dog which is dangerous for the Universe.”10[index_split_058.html#filepos955675][images/00007.jpg]Figure 16.3. Dacian battle standard known as the Draco, or Drago. Note itscometlike tail.Although it’s not stated which star “near” Ursa Major the infernal dog is to beidentified with, almost certainly it is Alcor, the Fox Star, or Wolf Star. It isa conclusion confirmed by the fact that this canine “is dangerous for theUniverse” and has the ability to bring about the destruction of everything. Assky monsters, the wolf and dragon are essentially one and the same, as is shownby the battle standard of the Dacians, the pre-Roman peoples of Romania. With awolf ’s head and serpent-like tail, it is called the Draco, or Drago, thedragon, and has been identified as a possible representation of a comet (seefigure 16.3).11 [index_split_058.html#filepos955880]TEUTONIC MYTHOLOGYThe great philologist and mythologist Jacob Grimm (1785–1863) in his multivolumework Teutonic Mythology discusses the role of the supernatural canid incatastrophe folklore. He saw the Fenris Wolf as quite simply the trickster godLoki “in a second birth . . . (although now) in the shape of a wolf.”12[index_split_058.html#filepos956002]Grimm cites also an old Scottish story about “the tayl of the wolfe and thewarldis end,”13 [index_split_058.html#filepos956144] a reference to the worldfalling apart following the appearance of a wolf ’s tail, which we can be prettysure is a metaphor for a comet. Grimm wrote that much fuller stories of how agreat wolf or dog had brought destruction to the world must once have existed“all over Germany, and beyond it,” adding that, “we still say, when baneful andperilous disturbances arise, ‘the devil is broke loose,’ while in the North theywould say ‘Loki er or böndum (Loki is out of control).’”14[index_split_058.html#filepos956256]Grimm quotes other examples of catastrophe-based folklore and folk beliefs amongthe peoples of medieval Europe. They include a popular French song about KingHenry IV that “expresses the far end of the future as the time when the wolf ’steeth shall get at the moon”15 [index_split_058.html#filepos956363]; in otherwords, the wolf will cause it to be extinguished, bringing about the world’send. All these stories seem to be fragmented memories of a terrible cataclysm,coupled with an unerring fear that one day it could all happen again.THE BUNDAHISHNThat these examples of canine cosmic tricksters, manifesting in the skies asplanet killers such as comets and asteroids, come from Europe and not Anatolianeed not concern us, for similar cosmological themes exist in sky lore muchcloser to Göbekli Tepe. The Bundahishn, a sacred text of Zoroastrianism, areligious doctrine that once thrived in Iran, India, and Armenia, contains itsown graphic account of a Ragnarök-style scenario, which includes the followingsomewhat enigmatic lines: “As Gokihar falls in the celestial sphere from amoon-beam on to earth, the distress of the earth becomes such-like as that of asheep when a wolf falls upon it.”16 [index_split_058.html#filepos956464]Gokihar is generally translated as “meteor,”17[index_split_058.html#filepos956804] that is, an incoming comet fragment,asteroid, or bolide of some sort, while the name itself has been interpreted asmeaning “wolf progeny.”18 [index_split_058.html#filepos956920] The doubleallusion in this statement to the wolf is significant, and one can envisage, andeven feel, the force of the assumed impact, here likened to the manner that asheep’s legs bend and collapse when pounced on by a wolf.That Gokihar’s appearance heralds some kind of apocalyptic event seems confirmedin the verse that follows: “Afterward, the fire and halo melt the metal of [thearchangel] Shatvairo, in the hills and mountains, and it [the molten metal]remains on this earth like a river.”19 [index_split_058.html#filepos957064] Ifthe impact of a comet fragment or asteroid is implied, then the presenceafterward of firestorms and rivers of molten “metal” caused by the eruption ofvolcanoes would be inevitable.After the destruction of the seven evil spirits under the rule of the evilprinciple, named Ahriman, Gokihar “burns the serpent in the melted metal, andthe stench and pollution which were in hell are burned in that metal, and it(hell) becomes quite pure.”20 [index_split_058.html#filepos957277]Once again these are indications that Gokihar, the “wolf progeny,” is involveddirectly with apocalyptic events described in the Bundahishn, and although theyfocus on a day of reckoning for both the gods and humanity, there is a sense ofthem forming part of a repeating cycle. In other words, the Bundahishn describesa replay of events that have already taken place. Christians in countries wherethe Norse myths remained strong associated the events of Ragnarök with thecoming Day of Judgment, described in the book of Revelation; in other words,they saw them as events to come, not events that had occurred during someprevious age.Gokihar ably takes the place of the Fenris Wolf in the Norse myths, although inthe Bundahishn there is a strange twist—the comet, or bolide, personified as asupernatural wolf, actually becomes a cleansing agent, clearing away the wickedin order to make the world “immortal forever and everlasting.”21[index_split_058.html#filepos957397]It is a disturbing account of a past that is to be repeated in the future, andif all this is true, then the cataclysm that Donnelly envisaged as having takenplace in some former epoch of humankind must have been so powerful, so allencompassing, that it affected not just a few isolated communities here andthere, but human populations all over the world. What then was this event, andhow did it come to affect the mind-set of the Epipaleolithic peoples thatoccupied southeast Anatolia in the age immediately prior to the construction ofGöbekli Tepe?As we see next, those who lived in the Near East at this time might have hadevery reason to be suffering from catastrophobia (as publisher, visionary, andmysteries writer Barbara Hand Clow so aptly put it in her book of the samename22 [index_split_058.html#filepos957517]), for the great cataclysm did notpass them by. Instead, it engulfed them in a quite terrifying manner that thescientific world is only now piecing together for the first time."},{"pageContent":"17A DARK DAY IN SYRIATell Abu Hureyra is an archaeological site of great importance on the MiddleEuphrates of northern Syria. It was occupied from the late Epipaleolithic age,ca. 11,340 BC, to the Neolithic age, ca. 5500 BC, although today it lies beneaththe waters of Lake Assad, created in 1973 following the completion of the TabqaDam.Investigation of Abu Hureyra began in 1972 under the leadership of Andrew Moorefrom the University of Oxford. Yet as the rising waters began to lap around thebase of the tell during the second digging season, the excavation changed into afrantic salvage operation as the British archaeologist’s team desperatelyattempted to understand the significance of the occupational mound before itsfinal submergence.THE BIG CHILLEven after the first season’s expedition it was clear that Abu Hureyra was aquite extraordinary site that would reveal much about the transition from theage of the hunter-gatherer to the establishment of settled farming communitiesacross the Near East. The second year of excavation, along with the subsequentwork continued both in Syria and at various foreign universities, enabled Mooreto get a pretty good picture of what had been going on at the site at the end ofthe Paleolithic age. He concluded that the first people to occupy the regionarrived as the climate warmed during the Allerød interstadial, which heraldedthe end of the last ice age, around 13,000 BC.In the two thousand years that followed there was a population boom throughoutthe Fertile Crescent, and it was during this new golden age that Abu Hureyra wasestablished. Its inhabitants—who belonged to the Natufian culture, whichinhabited the Levant region, ca. 12,900–9500 BC—lived mainly by hunting,fishing, and cultivating lentils and wild cereals, such as einkorn, emmer, andrye.With the onset of the big chill, known as the Younger Dryas, around 10,900 BC,there was a sudden and unexpected disruption to migratory animals across theregion. One animal that all but disappeared from the Fertile Crescent was thePersian gazelle, which until that time had formed a major part of the diet ofthe hunter-gatherers at Abu Hureyra.Adding to the problems of the Epipaleolithic hunter-gatherers was thedisappearance of forageable foods, such as wild grain and pistachio nuts, almostcertainly caused by the rapid climate change, which had brought with it a severedrought, revealed by an analysis of plant remains recovered from Abu Hureyra. Inthe end, its inhabitants were left with no alternative but to seek warmerclimes. It was the same throughout the Fertile Crescent, Natufian settlementsbeing abandoned to the elements, their distinctive style of living vanishingcompletely.The mini ice age lasted for approximately 1,300 years. After its cessationaround 9600 BC, just before the creation of the first large enclosures atGöbekli Tepe, the temperatures began to rise again. A new community wasestablished at Abu Hureyra, which built mud brick houses on the site of earlierdwellings. The inhabitants, now classed as members of the Pre-Pottery NeolithicA culture, used much fatter grain seeds for cultivation, making this perhaps oneof the oldest sites where the domestication of cereal crops is thought to haveoccurred.1 [index_split_058.html#filepos957719]MICROSPHERULES AND SLOSTheories about Tell Abu Hureyra and its role in the birth of agriculture at thepoint of transition from the Epipaleolithic age to the earliest Neolithicfarming communities remain controversial. Yet none of the scholars attempting tounderstand the evolution of the site, and its place in the emergence of thePrePottery Neolithic world, can have been prepared for what an eighteen-memberinternational team of researchers, including James Kennett, professor of earthscience at the University of California, found after examining sedimentmaterials removed from the site during Moore’s excavations in 1972 and 1973.Soil taken from a depth of 11.8 feet (3.6 meters) below the surface revealed,quite astonishingly, that it contained large quantities of almost nano-sizedmagnetic and glass balls known as microspherules, along with something calledSLOs, short for “siliceous scoria-like objects.” These are microscopic glassyparticles up to a quarter of an inch (roughly 6.5 millimeters) in size that arehighly porous and vesiculated, which means they are full of small sacs createdby gas bubbles. In appearance the SLOs resemble scoria, the name given to jaggedrock fragments ejected from volcanoes.What is so remarkable about SLOs is that they form only under incredibly hightemperatures, in the range of 3,100 to 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit (1,700 to 1,980degrees Celsius),2 [index_split_058.html#filepos958087] which, believe it ornot, is the boiling point of quartz, a form of silica. This, in its molten form,is one of the main constituents of SLOs, which can appear dark brown, green,white, or black. The extraordinary heat needed to create these glassy objectsrules out their manufacture by either human activity or volcanic action—or byany other natural process connected with the earth itself.Also discounted was the possibility that the tiny glass objects were produced inspace, then fell to earth as micrometeors. Results show that 90 percent of themicrospherules and SLOs are composed of elements not only distinct from cosmicmaterial, but also closely match the geochemistry of the rocks and sediment inthe area of their recovery, clearly indicating their terrestrial origin.MELT PRODUCTSThe microspherules and SLOs are also geochemically and morphologicallycomparable with each other; in other words, they derive from the same or verysimilar source materials. More significantly, they both show evidence of“high-energy interparticle collisions” of the sort that occur inside impactplumes.3 [index_split_058.html#filepos958547] Both are also comparable with meltproducts, tiny objects of molten glass, found at Meteor Crater, Arizona, thesite of an impact event around fifty thousand years ago, and also attektite-strewn fields in Australasia (tektites are glassy objects created from amixture of terrestrial and extraterrestrial matter ejected during impacts).More disturbingly, the SLOs found at Abu Hureyra and two other sites in theUnited States (Blackville, South Carolina, and Melrose, Pennsylvania) resemble“high-temperature materials”4 [index_split_058.html#filepos958647] found at theTrinity site, which forms part of the Alamogordo Bombing Range, New Mexico,following the detonation there of the first atomic bomb in 1945. Apparently, thethermal blast melted 0.5–1 inch (1–2.5 centimeters) of the desert floor for aradius of approximately 500 feet (150 meters) and left puddles of melted silicaglass objects across a wide area.MULTIPLE IMPACTORSNature herself creates such unbelievably high temperatures only during lightningstrikes. Under such conditions microspherules and SLOs can result, although whenthis occurs, the lateral spread of glassy objects is only around 60 inches (1.5meters); none generally reach beyond this point. However, the SLOs discovered atAbu Hureyra indicate a minimum spread of 14.5 feet (4.5 meters), ruling outlightning as their cause.All this supports the slightly disturbing conclusion that the microspherules andSLOs found at Abu Hureyra were the product of an unimaginable impact plume orfireball cloud. Moreover, the fact that similar microparticles were discoveredat three of the eighteen sites where evidence of an impact event was found bythe team tells us there must have been “multiple impactors,” air blasts causedby a fragmenting comet or asteroid, most likely the former.5[index_split_058.html#filepos958747] Most significant to this debate are thefinal words in the published paper containing the findings of the internationalteam:> Because these three sites in North America and the Middle East [i.e., Syria,> where SLOs were found] are separated by 1,000–10,000 km, we propose that there> were three or more major impact/airburst epicenters for the YDB [Younger Dryas> Boundary] impact event. If so, the much higher concentration of SLOs at Abu> Hureyra suggests that the effects on that settlement and its inhabitants would> have been severe.6 [index_split_058.html#filepos958847]The Younger Dryas Boundary (or YDB) impact event is the name given to thisproposed comet collision with Earth, which is believed to have occurred around10,900 BC. This date marks the “boundary” or “horizon” between the Allerødinterstadial and the Younger Dryas mini ice age. The glass microspherules andSLOs found at Abu Hureyra were located at this Younger Dryas Boundary,immediately beneath an organic-rich layer referred to as the “black mat,” which,the report claims, has been found at a number of sites in North and SouthAmerica, Europe, and now Syria.TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORTWe can only imagine how the Epipaleolithic hunter-gatherers of Abu Hureyra feltaround 12,900 years ago, gazing out of their subsurface round houses and seeingone or more blinding balls of fire crossing the open sky (like the meteor caughtso spectacularly on film as it passed over Russia’s Chelyabinsk region inFebruary 2013) before exploding shortly before impact with the ground and as aresult causing thunderous explosions, unlike anything ever imagined before inthe lives of these people. Moments later, everything—livestock, buildings, andpeople—are hit by a shock wave of soaring heat and wind that peppers everythingin its path with microscopic glassy objects, like the discharge of a hundredthousand shotguns all fired at once.This is just a glimpse of what might have happened at one location on theEuphrates River, but other Natufian settlements in the Levant and elsewherecould also have been affected by the Younger Dryas impact event. Indeed, we haveno real idea just how widespread the proposed devastation might have been, withthe only clue being the Usselo horizon. This is a “charcoalrich layer” measuring8 inches (20 centimeters) in thickness that has been detected at theAllerød–Younger Dryas Boundary at sites in the Netherlands, France, Germany,Belgium, Belarus, Poland, India, South Africa, Egypt, and Australia.7[index_split_058.html#filepos958947]This strange black layer has been found to contain magnetic grains,microspherules, iridium (an element commonly found in cosmic impactors), andnanodiamonds,8 [index_split_058.html#filepos959128] that is, pure carbon, all ofwhich supports the conclusion that the Usselo horizon is the result of multipleimpact events that sent ash, soot, and other debris high into the atmosphere.This mixture would eventually have fallen back to earth to create the Usselohorizon, which now becomes a telltale marker for the effects of the impact eventaround 12,900 years ago.In addition to the evidence presented here, other scientific teams haveuncovered similar evidence of microspherules at the Younger Dryas Boundary inVenezuela, South America, and various other parts of the world.9[index_split_058.html#filepos959331] It is thus clear that something very majordid go down at this time and that it involved a series of bolides, most likelyfragments of a comet that perhaps broke up during its slingshot orbit of thesun. The inhabitants on Earth would have seen all this—the arrival of the comet,or comets, in the sky, its reappearance and fragmentation, along with theincoming waves of fireballs and the terrifying air blasts as the fragmentsreached the lower atmosphere, causing maximum devastation on the earth itself.KILL, CHILL, ILL, AND NOW GRILL!The effects of the Younger Dryas Boundary impact event would have been felt onevery continent, although the true extent of the damage can only be guessed attoday. What we do know is that it coincided with the disappearance of the IceAge megafauna, such as mammoths, mastodons, giant ground sloths, dire wolves,and saber-toothed tigers. All of these animals existed in abundance until theend of the Allerød interglacial, then vanished with the onset of the YoungerDryas mini ice age. How exactly they disappeared remains a complete mystery,with three main theories being proposed: they died through overhunting (theoverkill theory); they died because of the sudden change in temperature at thebeginning of the mini ice age (the overchill theory); or they suffered some kindof mass epidemic, which wiped out whole species (the overill theory). Recently,a fourth contender has entered the debate, this being the over-grill theory,which proposes that they were decimated in the wildfires caused by the cometimpact.None of these theories—kill, chill, ill, or grill—is ever going to account forthe extinction of so many different Ice Age animals, and indeed there is a goodchance that all four scenarios played some role in their demise.Also around the same time North America’s Paleo-Indians, represented by theClovis culture, abruptly disappear from the archaeological record. With theknowledge that some of the larger fragments of the disintegrating comet arethought to have impacted with the Laurentide Ice Sheet—which had coveredhundreds of thousands of square miles of North America for much of the lastglacial age—causing the ice to vaporize and fall back to earth as acid rain, itbecomes increasingly likely that the Clovis population might have been greatlyreduced by the events of the Younger Dryas Boundary impact event.10[index_split_058.html#filepos959505]That some kind of cataclysm really did occur at the Allerød–Younger DryasBoundary seems inescapable, both from the evidence presented by science today,11[index_split_058.html#filepos959812] and from the wealth of catastrophe mythspreserved in ancient texts and by indigenous societies worldwide. All of thistells us very clearly that something terrible happened in the world around thistime, and very likely these legends refer, at least in part, to the samecatastrophic event. Most likely a disintegrating comet was the culprit, althoughwe cannot discount other possibilities, such as an asteroid or meteor impact, ora close supernova event. What is important, however, is its impact on themind-set of the peoples existing in the Euphrates Basin at the termination ofthe Paleolithic age, for there is compelling evidence that a memory of thisdevastating cataclysm lingered on in the minds of the Göbekli buildersthemselves."},{"pageContent":"18AFTERMATHOne of the major problems for farmers in southeast Turkey is that the landscapeis littered with basalt boulders of all shapes and sizes, making it difficult toplow or sow a piece of land unless the rocks are first moved to the edge of thefield. Since many of these boulders can be anything between several hundredpounds and a couple of tons apiece, this can often be a near impossible task.The sources of these boulders are local volcanoes, which are known to haveerupted in fairly recent geological history. Exactly when this might have beendiffers from volcano to volcano, although some kind of pattern might eventuallyemerge. One such volcano is Karajeddah Dağ, part of the Karaca Dağ massif, whichlies between the cities of Diyarbakır in the east and Şanlıurfa to the west. Itis Karaca Dağ, we should recall, that geneticists have identified as the pointof origin of sixty-eight modern strains of wheat, suggesting that it was here,in the heart of the triangle d’or, that the Neolithic revolution had itsinception.A BEDOUIN CATASTROPHE MYTHWith this information in mind, it is interesting to find that Karajeddah Dağ isthe setting for a highly significant folktale preserved by Bedouin tribespeople,who inhabit the area even to this day. The tale, told to the author in 2004 by aBedouin driver as they came within sight of the mountain,1[index_split_058.html#filepos960942] speaks of how once, long ago, whenhumankind first began to till the land, a dragon with seven heads lived in ahole.One day, the tillers’ plows revealed the monster’s lair, making the creatureextremely angry. It emerged into the light and began torching the forests withits fiery breath until all the trees had been razed to the ground. Fearing fortheir lives, the people called upon Allah to stop this misery. This he did bycarrying the monster up through the seven heavens until it reached the highestone, and here the dragon exploded with a great burst of fire, scattering rocksacross the entire region.SEVEN-TAILED COMETEven though this story exists to help explain the countless boulders ejected bythe now-extinct volcano, elements within it hint at a meaning on a much deeperlevel. The aerial detonation of the great dragon in the seventh heaven smacks ofthe sudden entry into the atmosphere of a fiery bolide, a comet perhaps. Theseven heads of the dragon suggest that the comet might have fragmented intoseven pieces or that it had multiple tails. In 1907 Comet Daniel appeared in ourskies with seven tails, leading one astronomer to refer to it as “this awesome,seven-tailed monster.”2 [index_split_058.html#filepos961255] That theseven-headed dragon of the story torched the forests with its fiery breath untilall the trees had been razed to the ground is another clear sign that this wasmore than simply the action of a volcano.If this Bedouin folktale does recall some memory of the Younger Dryas Boundaryimpact event, as well as an eruption of Karajeddah triggered at the same time,then this is very important indeed, especially as the mountain, although a full50 miles (80 kilometers) away from Göbekli Tepe, is just about visible on thenortheast horizon. Even more significant, however, is the reference in the storyto the first tillers of the land disturbing the lair of the fiery dragon,resulting in it wreaking havoc on the world. Does this allude to the firstpeople to begin cereal cultivation in the triangle d’or at the beginning of theNeolithic age? The fact that this tilling of the land was said to have triggeredthese catastrophic events need not worry us, as after thirteen thousand yearsconfusion as to what happened in which order is understandable.Behind this archaic story is one final piece of useful information. The folktaletells us that it was the tillers’ actions that caused the release of the dragon.In other words, the inhabitants of the region, whose descendants we know becamethe first farmers, blamed themselves for the destruction it caused. If correct,then we can better understand why the Epipaleolithic hunter-gatherers ofsoutheast Anatolia so feared a repeat of these events, for in their minds it wastheir actions that had caused the original catastrophe, in which case it couldall happen again if they were not careful, the definition perhaps of BarbaraHand Clow’s catastrophobia. No wonder these people might have accepted the offerof an incoming elite to rid them of this constant fear, a decision that led,eventually, to the construction of Göbekli Tepe.PROFESSOR SCHMIDT’S OPINIONSWhether there is a connection between Göbekli Tepe and the Younger DryasBoundary impact event is something the author put to Professor Klaus Schmidtduring an impromptu interview in September 2012. His immediate response was anemphatic “no, no connection.” It was, however, pointed out to him that there wasnow firm evidence that the Natufian settlement at Tell Abu Hureyra on the MiddleEuphrates, just 100 miles (160 kilometers) away, might have been an impact zone,and that in the opinion of the scientists who made this discovery, “the effectson that settlement and its inhabitants would have been severe.”3[index_split_058.html#filepos961404]Schmidt’s dismissal of the subject is, however, understandable. Even if theproposed impact event of 10,900 BC really did occur in the manner described,then this was a full 1,400 years before the construction of the oldest knownenclosures at Göbekli Tepe, ca. 9500 BC. Surely, the hunter-gatherers of theregion would have forgotten what had happened so many centuries after thissupposed catastrophe took place.This is a valid point, although scientific evidence indicates that somethingcatastrophic continued to happen in the world for many hundreds of years afterthe commencement of the Younger Dryas cold spell. Drilled cores taken from theGreenland ice sheet reveal that ammonium levels in the atmosphere, arguablycaused by the spread of wildfires, rose suddenly around 12,900 years ago,coincident to the proposed impact event, and then remained high for hundreds ofyears afterward.4 [index_split_058.html#filepos961578] They then spiked againaround 12,340 years ago, that is 10,340 BC, suggesting that something elseoccurred at this time, prompting Dr. Richard Firestone of Lawrence BerkeleyNational Laboratory of Nuclear Science and his coauthors in their book The Cycleof Cosmic Catastrophes to comment, “We think that [10,340 BC] may be the date ofone of the impacts.”5 [index_split_058.html#filepos962068]In other words, we could be looking at another major impact on or around 10,340BC, which brought to a climax a sequence of events that had been happening onand off since the initial impact some five centuries earlier. Firestone and histeam propose that at least part of the ammonium content in the Greenland icecores came from a disintegrating comet, the rest from the wildfires it caused.In addition to the massive spike in ammonium corresponding to a date of 12,340years ago detected in the Greenland ice cores, the levels of nitrate theycontain also peaked at exactly the same date—12,340 BP. Nitrate is anotherchemical produced by wildfires, although when the levels shoot up for bothammonium and nitrate together, it could mean that the fires in question wereburning fiercely, as opposed to smoldering after the event.6[index_split_058.html#filepos962240]Compounding the mystery still further is the fact that another chemical,oxalate, also spikes in the Greenland ice core samples for the date 12,340 BP,and this too is associated with wildfires. Apparently this peak is the higheston record for the entire four hundred thousand years covered by the ice cores.7[index_split_058.html#filepos962350] The importance of these findings is madeclear by Firestone and his coauthors when they write, “The researchers tested alot of ice, and they did not find any event as severe as that one, which spannedabout four ice-age cycles. We think that it was no ordinary fire; it was acosmic one.”8 [index_split_058.html#filepos962456]Whether a comet was responsible for the wildfires raging some 12,340 years agoremains a matter of speculation, although the ice core samples make it clearthat the world was not at all stable at that time. Remember too that this is afull 560 years after the proposed Younger Dryas impact event of 12,900 yearsago, and just 850 years, arguably less, before the construction of the firstlarge enclosures at Göbekli Tepe.A REMEDY FOR CATASTROPHOBIAMammoth building projects like Göbekli Tepe were initiated, most probably, afterthe inhabitants of southeast Anatolia came into contact with other parties, mostlikely displaced peoples from some other part of the ancient world. They perhapsbrought with them a virtual messianic message explaining how they had the powerto put an end to the prevailing state of fear. We have called them the HoodedOnes and suspect that it is their memory, and the memory of their own greatancestors, embodied in the T-shaped pillars erected at Göbekli Tepe. Mostlikely, this power elite was shamanic in nature and believed it had some specialrelationship with either the fox or the wolf, a connection that gave themcontrol over the sky fox or sky wolf responsible for bringing destruction to theworld.It is time now to examine the archaeological record in the hope of identifyingthis incoming group who would appear to have had such a big impact on theEpipaleolithic peoples of southeast Anatolia. Where did they come from, and howwere they so easily able to convince communities of hunters to give up theirfree lives to build huge stone monuments, the oldest known astronomicallyaligned temples anywhere in the world? The answers, as we shall see in partfour, might well lie on a different continent together, with that continentbeing Europe."},{"pageContent":"PART FOURContact[images/00125.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"19THE REINDEER HUNTERSDr. Alice Roberts is a British anatomist, anthropologist, and osteoarchaeologist(bone specialist), as well as an author and TV presenter. In her book TheIncredible Human Journey (2009), written to accompany a BBC documentary seriesof the same name, she visited Göbekli Tepe and chatted at some length with leadarchaeologist Professor Klaus Schmidt. During the interview Roberts made apoignant observation, based on a sound knowledge of ancient stone tooltechnologies. She noted that the toolkit in use at Göbekli Tepe “was similar tosome of the tanged point cultures of Central Europe, in the late Paleolithic andMesolithic.”1 [index_split_058.html#filepos962635]In response, Schmidt suggested that “perhaps there was some kind of connectionor communication between the societies of Turkey and those around the Black Seaand the Crimea,”2 [index_split_058.html#filepos962781] noting also a similaritybetween the style of game hunting in southeast Anatolia in the epoch of GöbekliTepe’s construction and the “reindeer hunters of the North.”3[index_split_058.html#filepos962881] Yet as if, immediately, to distance himselffrom any proposed connection between Europe and Göbekli Tepe, Schmidt pointedout that there is nothing “even vaguely like it in Europe . . . until well intothe Neolithic.”4 [index_split_058.html#filepos962981]TANGED POINT CULTURESThis is true; there is absolutely nothing to compare with Göbekli Tepe anywherein Europe or, indeed, anywhere else in the ancient world until much later, whenmegalithic architecture begins in earnest at places such as Malta, Sardinia,Brittany, Ireland, and, of course, Britain. Yet that doesn’t rule out thetantalizing possibility that the Göbekli builders came in contact with peoplesfrom Europe, and from what Dr. Roberts and Klaus Schmidt were both implying,perhaps we should be looking toward the “tanged point cultures” and “reindeerhunters of the North” for some answers.In the late Upper Paleolithic age reindeer hunters who occupied the forests andplains of Northern Europe, often operating on the sandy terrains of loess leftbehind by the melting glaciers, started different hunting strategies becausetheir perennial prize, the reindeer herds, were abandoning their old territoriesand moving ever northward and northeastward. The animals undertook thesecontinual migrations so that they could remain within the forests and tundra(land with small trees and plants) essential for their continued survival. Evenwith the onset of the Younger Dryas mini ice age, ca. 10,900 BC, the reindeerkept moving, even though the worsening weather conditions were forcing humanpopulations to migrate ever southward.As part of their change in strategy, the reindeer hunters at the termination ofthe Upper Paleolithic age, which in Europe quickly transformed into theMesolithic age, adopted the use of a very specific type of weapon, usually madeof flint and known as the tanged point. This is a type of arrowhead, eithershaped like a willow leaf or geometric (that is, triangular) in form. Thesepoints have distinctive “shoulders,” or “tangs,” delicately chipped away fromthe base so that they could more easily be hafted onto an arrow shaft. Sometimesthe points have only one tang, or shoulder, while at other times they have two.Clearly, the use of the bow and arrow gave Paleolithic hunters the advantage notonly during the chase but also over human enemies.THE CASE OF MARY SETTEGASTSo could there have been some kind of contact between these reindeer hunters ofthe North European Plain and the Epipaleolithic peoples of southeast Anatolia inthe lead up to the construction of the first large enclosures at Göbekli Tepe?The answer is almost certainly yes. In 1987 a fascinating book entitled PlatoPrehistorian, by archaeological writer Mary Settegast, attempted to paint apicture of the turmoil that might have existed in Europe in the aftermath of aglobal catastrophe at the end of the last ice age. Settegast linked this eventwith the account given by the Greek philosopher Plato in his works Timaeus andCritias, written around 350 BC. He, of course, describes the destruction of amythical island empire called Atlantis that was said to have existed beyond thePillars of Hercules, out in the Atlantic Ocean.According to Plato the main island of Atlantis sank beneath the waves around9500 BC following a day and night of earthquakes and floods, sent by the sky godZeus to punish the Atlanteans for having become too haughty and arrogant. Priorto this time they had made incursions into the Mediterranean and attacked majorcity-ports as far east as Italy’s Tyrrhenian Sea, then under the control of theAthenians.Plato’s account of Atlantis might well be based on some kind of historicalreality, although the wars between the Atlanteans and the Athenians are muchmore difficult to prove, especially given that Athens and its inhabitants, theAthenians, did not exist in 9500 BC. For this reason, some of Settegast’sproposals are quite obviously biased toward accepting the validity of Plato’saccount. That said, the evidence she presents for bloodshed and turmoil inEurope at the end of the Ice Age is stunning.5[index_split_058.html#filepos963081]THE SWIDERIAN CULTURECrucially, Settegast recognized that during the Younger Dryas period, ca.10,900–9600 BC, major migrations were taking place all over Europe, seemingly inthe aftermath of the proposed cataclysm. Among those on the move was a specificgroup of reindeer hunters known as the Swiderians. They began pushing fartherand farther eastward and southward until they were quite literally knocking onAnatolia’s door.Mary Settegast realized that as they moved across Europe at the onset of theYounger Dryas cold spell, the Swiderians left behind a noticeable trail offinely carved tanged points. It stretched all the way from the CarpathianMountains of Central Europe right across to the Crimean Mountains, located on apeninsula immediately west of the Sea of Azov, a northerly extension of theBlack Sea, in what is today Ukraine. She noted also that around this same timestrikingly similar tanged points started to appear at Epipaleolithic andproto-Neolithic sites in the Near East, something that is unlikely to be asimple coincidence.6 [index_split_058.html#filepos963214][images/00067.jpg]Figure 19.1. Map showing the eastern migration of tanged, or shouldered, points,most likely arrowheads, belonging to the Swiderian culture, which emerged ca.11,000 BC.To better argue her case, Settegast included in her book a map that shows thetrail of Swiderian points across Europe,7 [index_split_058.html#filepos963324] aversion of which is included here (see figure 19.1). Her compelling evidenceprompted the question of what exactly these Paleolithic hunters were doingcrossing Eastern Europe so boldly, with the standard explanation being that theywere following the flight of the reindeer herds, but as Settegast herself noted,many of their campsites show very little evidence of the spoils of the chase,8[index_split_058.html#filepos963445] so clearly something else was going on intheir lives. So who exactly were the Swiderians, and how do they fit into thegradually emerging picture painted so far in this book?THE SWIDERIAN LANDSCAPEThe Swiderians take their name from an occupational “type” site where theirunique style of stone tool technology was first recognized. This is ŚwidryWielkie in Otwock, near Warsaw in Poland, which now forms one of the thousandsof campsites, work stations, and settlement sites that the culture createdacross a vast territory, stretching from Poland in the west across to Belarus,Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Moldova, and Ukraine. They make their presence knownfor the first time at the beginning of the Younger Dryas period, occupying theforests, steppes, and glacial loess of the East European Plain, and settling onmajor rivers including the Vistula, Oder, and Warta in the west, and theDnieper, Volga, Oka, and Don in the east.9 [index_split_058.html#filepos963555]In addition to this, they are known to have occupied the northern and easternfoothills of the Carpathian Mountains,10 [index_split_058.html#filepos963700]which embrace Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, Ukraine, and Romania (which is made upof the former kingdoms of Transylvania, Wallachia, and western Moldavia).The culture’s principal calling cards, so to speak, were their distinctivetanged points, along with their exquisitely finished leaf-shaped points.Prehistorians propose that the Swiderians were an offshoot of one of thepreexisting reindeer-hunting traditions of Northern Europe, either theHamburgian-Ahrenburgian cultures of North Germany or, more likely, theBrommian-Lyngby cultures of Denmark and the Scandinavia Peninsula (together theyform what is known as the Tanged Point Technocomplex). Yet as we see next, theSwiderians had ancient roots that mark them out as more successful than theircontemporaries. They would seem also to have had a great motivation and drivethat has allowed them to be credited with the foundation of various subgroupsthat were instrumental in the establishment of European culture and language ona number of different levels. It is a long road from Central Europe to Anatolia,but it is one we must now take to create a better picture of why exactly theSwiderians are so crucial to the story of Göbekli Tepe and the rise ofcivilization in the ancient world."},{"pageContent":"20SWIDERIAN DAWNThe effect the Younger Dryas Boundary impact event of 10,900 BC might have hadon Europe remains unclear. Yet evidence of its aftermath can be found at sitesacross the continent as the Usselo horizon, the 8-inch (20-centimeter)charcoal-rich layer lying between soils signifying the termination of theAllerød interstadial and the commencement of the Younger Dryas mini ice age, ca.10,900 BC.1 [index_split_058.html#filepos963904] Listed among the countries inEurope where this black layer has been found are the Netherlands, France,Germany, and Belgium, as well as known Swiderian territories such as Belarusand, as we shall see now, Poland.THE WITÓW PEOPLEAt the beginning of the 1960s, archaeologists working on a site at Witów, nearŁęczyca, in the Polish province of Łódź, were puzzled to find “a charcoal layerin late-glacial dune, comparable to [the] Usselo-layer.”2[index_split_058.html#filepos964253] This layer was found to contain flintartifacts “forming a hitherto unknown assemblage,”3[index_split_058.html#filepos964410] while in the sand immediately above thisblack mat, archaeologists came across stone implements belonging to the “middleSwiderian industry,”4 [index_split_058.html#filepos964510] showing that theSwiderian reindeer hunters were here at this time.In addition to the flint implements, archaeologists found at Witów four largeovoid “huts,” all aligned east-west. Each one contained various finds, includinga noticeable amount of hematite, which is a highly magnetic, iron-based mineral,usually rust red in color. It is crushed to make a pigment called ochre, used inrock art and human decoration, such as tattoos and body paint.Radiocarbon analyses for the charcoal layer provided dates in the region of10,820±160 BP, or 8820 BC. However, when these tests took place it was notrealized that recalibration is necessary to bring raw radiocarbon dates in linewith the true trend of carbon-14 release from organic materials, so when this isapplied the charcoal layer offers dates in the range of 11,000–10,500 BC, wellwithin the proposed time frame of the Younger Dryas Boundary impact event of ca.10,900 BC.SWIDERIANS IN CRIMEAThe stone tools found inside the huts at Witów in Poland were initially quite amystery to archaeologists, leading them to announce the discovery of apreviously unknown culture.5 [index_split_058.html#filepos964610] What they didnotice, however, were similarities between the assemblage’s curved-back knivesand blade segments with examples found over 850 miles (1,400 kilometers) away inthe Shan Koba cave in Crimea.6 [index_split_058.html#filepos964762] These arenow recognized as belonging to a Crimean Swiderian culture, responsible also forthe manufacture of Swiderian points found at other sites in the CrimeanHighlands, immediately north of the Black Sea.7[index_split_058.html#filepos964867]Here in a rock shelter known as Syuren 2, tanged blades have been unearthed“with direct analogies to the Polish Swiderian.”8[index_split_058.html#filepos965269] In other words, they are more or lessidentical to those found at the culture’s mostly open air sites in theiroriginal heartland of Poland and the Carpathian Mountains. More crucially, theexamples found in the Syuren 2 rock shelter are so similar to the real thingthat two Russian prehistorians were led to conclude that a “direct migration ofa group of Swiderian population in the Crimea is not excluded.”9[index_split_058.html#filepos965414] In other words, the Swiderian peoples whoinhabited these caves might well have been the immediate descendants of reindeerhunters who had arrived in this region from Poland.If these migrations really did take place, then it is unbelievable evidence ofthe sheer endurance and willpower of these people, who crossed the entire lengthof Eastern Europe to end up on the Black Sea. What is more, there is tentativeevidence that they did not stop their journey there. In 1959 Russianprehistorian Aleksandr Formozov saw evidence of stone tools of theSwiderian-European style as far east as the Caucasus Mountains of Georgia,10[index_split_058.html#filepos966208] which stretch between the Black Sea in thewest and the Caspian Sea in the east. If correct, then this brings the reindeerhunters within striking distance of the Armenian Highlands, just a couple ofhundred miles away from Göbekli Tepe.TANGED POINTS IN THE NEAR EASTSupporting the idea that the Swiderians reached even beyond the CaucasusMountains is, as Mary Settegast realized, the fact that a great many tangedpoints strikingly similar to those manufactured in Europe have been found atEpipaleolithic and early Neolithic sites across the Near East. Indeed, if theyhad been found on European soil, archaeologists would have had no qualms inidentifying them as belonging to one or another of the North Europeanreindeer-hunting traditions.Clearly, there are certain differences in style. Sometimes the tang is trapezoidin shape, or with a slight barb. Alternatively, notches are made on either sideof the blade, making it easier to haft onto an arrow shaft. Despite thesevariations, there are enough similarities to suggest that the Swiderian reindeerhunters were somewhere in the background. Indeed, leaf-shaped tanged points thateasily compare with those created as part of the Swiderian tradition have beenfound at Göbekli Tepe (see figure 20.1 on p. 174).11[index_split_058.html#filepos966692] This opens up the possibility that theEuropean reindeer hunters, or at least their direct descendants, really werepresent in southeast Anatolia and might well have influenced the development ofits earliest Neolithic cultures, something they certainly did in other parts ofthe ancient world.POST-SWIDERIAN CULTURESHaving established many hundreds of settlement sites as far east as the Don andUpper Volga rivers of Central Russia, Swiderian groups spread into newterritories, where they created post-Swiderian cultures, such as the Kunda andButovo, which thrived between the middle of the tenth millennium and the end ofthe seventh millennium BC in Estonia, Belarus, Latvia, and northwest Russia.12[index_split_058.html#filepos967119] Here they adopted an advanced toolmakingtechnique known as surface pressure flaking, a process so unique that whendiscovered at a Mesolithic site in north or northeast Europe it is seen as clearevidence of a Swiderian presence there.Pressure flaking is a process whereby a bone tool or antler is used to trim abiface (an implement shaped on both faces) by very carefully applying pressureto its edges in order to prize off rows of tiny flakes. This produces equallyspaced, concave troughs, each one generally overlapping the next in line, whichcan reach as far as the center of the implement, giving it a perfect geometricfinish.[images/00014.jpg]Figure 20.1. Comparison of tanged points found in the fill at Göbekli Tepe (Aand C) against two examples (B and D) from the Swiderian culture.Although stone tools dating back seventy-five thousand years found at theBlombos Cave in South Africa show evidence of having been finished usingpressure flaking, it is a technique not usually associated with Europeancultures at the end of the Paleolithic age. This said, pressure flaking wasbeing used in eastern Anatolia to process obsidian (see chapter 22) during thePre-Pottery Neolithic B period, ca. 8700 BC and 6000 BC, and was present at theNeolithic city of Çatal Höyük by 7000 BC.13 [index_split_058.html#filepos967356]FINNO-UGRIC PEOPLESThere is firm evidence also that post-Swiderian groups entered Finland andestablished key settlements during the ninth millennium BC. Here theirtraditions are associated with the country’s Finno-Ugric speaking peoples,including the Sámi, a shamanic-based, reindeer-herding culture that exists tothis day.14 [index_split_058.html#filepos967615] Additionally, newly discoveredsettlement sites in Norway, dating to roughly the same age as those inneighboring Finland, have revealed evidence of a blade technology identified aspost-Swiderian in nature.15 [index_split_058.html#filepos967828] Similar toolshave been found at a Mesolithic site in Lapland, northern Sweden, dated to ca.6600 BC.16 [index_split_058.html#filepos968005] What is more, extraordinarilyaccomplished stone tools finished using pressure flaking techniques weremanufactured during the late Neolithic/early Bronze Age, ca. 3000–2500 BC, inparts of Scandinavia (Denmark in particular), and this can be put down to thepresence of technologically advanced cultures deriving from the post-Swideriantradition.All this implies that some of the earliest influences on Finnish, Scandinavian,and Baltic ethnicity, culture, stone technology, and, very likely, mythologymight well have originated with the Swiderian reindeer hunters, whose originalhomeland was the forests, steppes, and river valleys of Central and EasternEurope. Yet who exactly were the Swiderians? Where did they come from, and whatdid they look like?HUMAN HYBRIDSAnatomically speaking, the Swiderians have been described as “tall . . .long-headed, [and] thin faced.”17 [index_split_058.html#filepos968189] It issomething confirmed by noted Lithuanian anthropologist Marija Gimbutas(1921–1994), who in 1956 detailed the discovery eight years earlier, in 1948, ofa partial cranium, minus its lower jaw, at Kebeliai, near Priekulė in Lithuania.Dating to the end of the Paleolithic age, when Swiderian settlements occupiedthe area, it is said to have been “massive, dolichocephalic [that is, longheaded], with strong proclivity [inclination] of the forehead, prominent andmassive brow ridges and a narrow forehead.” In her opinion the strange skull“was sapiens, but had Neanderthaloid elements, in other words, [it] was aNeanderthal-sapiens hybrid.”18 [index_split_058.html#filepos968629] Gimbutasspoke also of a “closely related” cranium dating again to the end of the lastglacial age, this one discovered on the Skhodnia River, northwest of Moscow,19[index_split_058.html#filepos968779] where Swiderian groups are known to haveexisted at this time.A third skull of interest, attributed to the post-Swiderian Kunda culture andfound in a pit paved with stones at Kirsna in the district of Marijampolė insouthern Lithuania, Gimbutas describes as “hyperdolichocephic [that is,extremely long headed] . . . narrow faced, high-orbited,” and resembling the“Brünn skull of central Europe.”20 [index_split_058.html#filepos968880]The “Brünn skull” mentioned refers to one of a number of examples, all verysimilar, unearthed in 1891 at Brünn (modern Brno), the capital of Moravia inwhat is today the Czech Republic. Here human remains dating back as much astwenty-five thousand years were found that had a slightly different physiognomyto the pre-existing Cro-Magnon population that had entered Europe from Africaaround forty-three thousand years ago.21 [index_split_058.html#filepos968991]Whereas the Cro-Magnon were broad-faced, large-headed individuals, the Brünnskulls displayed “extreme elongation and dolichocephaly,”22[index_split_058.html#filepos969755] that is, their craniums were long andnarrow. They also had strong chins, high cheekbones, low, wide-set eye orbits,and, like the Kebeliai example, prominent brow ridges.23[index_split_058.html#filepos969896]Similar skulls from the same human population were unearthed three years laterin 1894 at PÅ™edmost (modernly spelt Predmostí), also in the Czech Republic.Fourteen complete skeletons and the remains of six others had been placed in atight circle within a pit, their bodies contracted into a squatting position andsurrounded by a bank of stones. The size of the limbs of these individualsindicated that they were of “large stature.”24[index_split_058.html#filepos970099] The finds at PÅ™edmost led anthropologistsof the period to start referring to this unknown human type as “Brünn-PÅ™edmostman” and even Homo pÅ™edmostensis.25 [index_split_058.html#filepos970240]Speculation mounted in the early twentieth century that the Brünn population ofthe Upper Paleolithic age were in fact “Neanderthaloids,” eitherNeanderthal-human hybrids and/or the remnants of an intermediary stage betweenthe two species,26 [index_split_058.html#filepos970388] ideas that almostcertainly influenced the observations made by Marija Gimbutas in 1956 regardingthe strange physiognomy of the Kebeliai skull.It is thus possible that the Swiderians of Central and Eastern Europe weredirectly related to the Brünn population and that both either evolved from orcontained within their communities Neanderthal-human hybrids of quite strikingappearance, having elongated heads, long faces, high foreheads, prominent browridges (a specific Neanderthal trait), high cheekbones, large jaws (a Cro-Magnontrait), and an increased height. It was a physiognomy inherited bypost-Swiderian cultures, such as the Kunda, who are elsewhere described as tallwith elongated skulls and narrow faces.27 [index_split_058.html#filepos970526]That the Swiderians might have been related to the Brünn population thatappeared in Central Europe sometime around twenty-five thousand years ago is anextraordinary realization. Yet it is a conclusion strengthened in the knowledgethat the Swiderians might well have inherited one of the most accomplished andmysterious traditions of the Upper Paleolithic age—that of the Solutrean, amatter we explore next.[images/00094.jpg]Plate 1.

Their campsites, work stations,and cave sites date to between 25,000 and 16,500 years ago and span from England(especially East Anglia) in the north, to northern Spain, Portugal, and Francein the south. Like the Swiderians much later, the Solutreans mastered the use ofsurface pressure flaking to create highly unique willow-leaf-shaped projectilepoints and much larger, laurel-leaf-shaped lance heads, which share similaritiesto the Swiderians’ own leaflike points. Moreover, like the Swiderians, theSolutreans—who were themselves reindeer hunters—fashioned shouldered (i.e.,tanged) points, with either one or two shoulders (see figure 21.1 on p. 178) andthus almost certainly used bows and arrows.So thin and so finely worked are the Solutreans’ laurel-leaf lance heads, whichcan be up to 14 inches (36 centimeters) in length, translucent, and just aquarter of an inch (0.6 centimeter) thick (see plate 25[index_split_031.html#filepos436317]), that Sharon McKern, an anthropologicalconsultant, writing with her husband, Dr. Thomas McKern, professor ofanthropology at the University of Kansas, was moved to observe: “This delicatelyflaked tool technique is the most aesthetic—and the most mysterious—known fromprehistoric times.”1 [index_split_058.html#filepos970778] The fact that a numberof these unique blades have been found in groups within caches and are regularlymade of nonlocal, exotic materials (including chalcedony, jasper, and quartzcrystal) has led to speculation that they were not used for any practicalpurpose but instead served some ritual or symbolic function.[images/00122.jpg]Figure 21.1. A selection of finely worked Solutrean points, ca. 20,000– 14,500BC, many finished using the pressure flaking technique.RIMUTÈ RIMANTIENÈ’S COMMENTSSo what exactly is the connection between the Solutreans and the laterSwiderians? In 1996 Lithuanian archaeologist Rimutè Rimantienè proposed groupingtogether the various North European cultures that thrived in the UpperPaleolithic under a single umbrella term—the Baltic Magdalenian, or the “Groupof Baltic Magdalenian cultures,” because they all display signs of having acommon origin.2 [index_split_058.html#filepos970925] Just one culture was to beexcluded from the list, and this was the Swiderian, “where the relations withthe Solutrean are outstanding, though also indirect.”3[index_split_058.html#filepos971086]Rimantienè recognized the remarkable similarities between the stone tooltechnologies of the two cultures and felt the need to put this in writing, eventhough making such a connection was clearly anathema in the scholarly communityin which she moved.*8 [index_split_057.html#filepos914421] The problem issimple—the Swiderian culture does not enter the scene until the beginning of theYounger Dryas period, ca. 10,900 BC. This is thirty-five hundred years after theSolutreans disappear from the pages of European history to make way for theMagdalenians, an altogether different culture whose principal legacy is thebeautiful Ice Age cave art of southwest Europe.As to the fate of the Solutreans, no one really knows, although someprehistorians propose that they departed for the North European Plain when thereindeer herds migrated northward at the end of the last ice age. If so, thenthey might easily have formed the core of much later reindeer-huntingtraditions, in particular the Brommian-Lyngby cultures of Denmark and theScandinavian Peninsula. Certainly, laurel-leaf points and shouldered points,identical to those of the Solutreans, have been found in the south and west ofSweden and Norway,4 [index_split_058.html#filepos971186] suggesting stronglythat this is where the Solutreans came looking for the reindeer herds. Heretheir descendants would have remained until the onset of the Younger Dryas miniice age, when with the worsening climate they were forced southward into CentralEurope, paving the way for the emergence of the Swiderian tradition in placessuch as Poland, Slovakia, and the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains.ANCIENT MARINERSAll this is quite plausible, although there is now mounting evidence to suggestthat the Solutreans also took to the high seas and ended up in North America,having navigated the southern limits of the sea ice that clogged large areas ofthe North Atlantic Ocean some twenty thousand years ago.5[index_split_058.html#filepos971338]In North America, beyond the Laurentide Ice Sheet, which reached as far south asMissouri and the Ohio River Basin, the Solutrean hunters became the forerunnersof the Clovis culture, producing laurel-leaf-shaped blades very similar to thosemanufactured in Western Europe. It was a tradition continued in the productionof the exquisite Clovis points, manufactured using the pressure flakingtechnique by the Clovis people, who thrived in many parts of North Americaaround the same time as the emergence of the Swiderian culture some thirteenthousand years ago. Yet unlike the Clovis culture that flourished for just fivehundred to seven hundred years before disappearing during the Younger Dryasperiod, the Swiderians continued to thrive, creating all manner ofpost-Swiderian cultures, which, as we have seen, went on to occupy large areasof north and northeast Europe during Mesolithic times.THE BRÜNN CONTROVERSYStrengthening the connection between the Solutrean and Swiderian traditionsstill further is the fact that the two cultures might once have shared the sameterritories and the same physiognomy. It has long been known that a stone toolindustry identical to that of the early Solutrean existed in Germany and themodern Czech Republic, and even further east in Hungary and Poland.6[index_split_058.html#filepos971511]Anthropologists of the early twentieth century became convinced that theSolutreans derived not from Cro-Magnons but from the Brünn peoples, who emergedonto the scene in places such as Hungary and the Czech Republic aroundtwenty-five thousand years ago, where they formed part of the much larger, andfar older, Eastern Gravettian culture. This connection was no idle speculationeither, for quite distinctive Solutrean tools and laurel-leaf blades were foundin association with human remains of the Brünn type at two separate sites, oneof them being PÅ™edmost in the Czech Republic, leading Princeton paleontologistand geologist Henry Fairfield Osborn (1857–1935) to observe: “There is noquestion that the human remains [found at PÅ™edmost] belong to the middleSolutrean stage.”7 [index_split_058.html#filepos972017] It was a link thatseemed confirmed with the discovery in the late nineteenth century of skullssimilar to those of the Brünn type at Solutré, west of Mâcon in France’sSaône-et-Loire region,8 [index_split_058.html#filepos972176] which, as the namesuggests, was the original “type-site” of the Solutrean tradition.Yet when, in the second half of the twentieth century, typological thinkingregarding the racial origins of humankind became unfashionable, if not downrightdistasteful, any proposed connections between the Brünn type and the Solutreantradition were dropped. Not only did this leave the Solutreans without anydefinitive physical characteristics, but any notion that the Solutreans ofWestern Europe were related to the Solutreans of Central Europe was abandoned.Indeed, those of Central Europe were stripped completely of their Solutreanstatus and reclassified as a separate culture that evolved quite independentlyof the Solutreans of Western Europe.Despite this awkward and somewhat strange reclassification process, it remainspossible that the Solutrean tradition really is tied in with the suddenappearance in Central Europe of the Brünn population around twenty-five thousandyears ago. Having said this, modern anthropological thinking has the Solutreansenter southwest Europe from Africa where, it has been suggested, they formedpart of a Saharan culture known as the Aterian, which employed the use ofstrikingly similar toolmaking techniques. Yet equally likely is that theSolutreans and the human population of Central Europe categorized as the Brünntype came from the east, not the south.Paleolithic stone tool expert Bruce Bradley, Ph.D., of the University of Exeter,and his colleagues have proposed that the Solutreans’ highly sophisticated stonetechnology originated among the peoples who occupied a region stretching fromthe cold forest steppes north and northeast of the Black Sea as far north as thecentral Russian Plain. Here between ca. 30,000 BC and 19,000 BC thrived anadvanced culture known as the Kostenki-Streletskaya, which formed part of themuch larger Eastern Gravettian tradition and produced stone tools and projectilepoints with close parallels to those manufactured by the Solutreans in bothcentral and southwest Europe.9 [index_split_058.html#filepos972318]These Ice Age peoples of the Russian steppes and plain inhabited a series ofsettlement sites, including Kostenki, the culture’s principal type-site, on thewest bank of the Don River, and Sungir on the Klyazma River. At this last site,located on the outskirts of the city of Vladimir, some 110 miles (177kilometers) east-northeast of Moscow, three extraordinary human burials wereuncovered in 1956. Each was adorned with thousands of ivory beads, which hadbeen attached to tailored garments of immense sophistication. Radiocarbonevidence shows that the burials took place as early as 30,000 BC.10[index_split_058.html#filepos972570] One of the skulls, Sungir 1,11[index_split_058.html#filepos972768] bears similarities to some of the skullsfound at the PÅ™edmost site in the Czech Republic, in particular an exampleknown as PÅ™edmost 3. With its prominent brow ridge and pronounced jaw, it bearsdistinct characteristics of not only the Brünn population that entered CentralEurope around twenty-five thousand years ago and perhaps kickstarted theSolutrean culture, but also the Neanderthal-human hybrid skulls found in Russiaand Lithuania (see chapter 20), which might well have belonged to individualsstemming from the Swiderian culture. It is a supposition supported by theobservations of one of the twentieth century’s greatest prehistorians, V. GordonChilde. In his book The Prehistory of European Society, published in 1958, hewrites:> In Western and Central Europe the “Solutrean” seems a brief episode that> exercised no recognizable influence on subsequent developments. In Eastern> Europe on the contrary Solutrean techniques were applied at times to the later> East Gravettian (Kostienki) flint-work and survived locally even in the> Mesolithic Swiderian industry.”12 [index_split_058.html#filepos972895]Childe recognized the close similarity between the “flint-work” of all threetraditions and believed that the Swiderians and Solutreans derived theircharacteristic toolmaking capabilities from the Kostenki-Streletskaya culture ofCentral Russia. In other words, their true point of origin was not to be lookedfor in Central Europe, but much further east, on the Russian Plain, where highlyadvanced peoples, almost certainly related to the Brünn population, existed atplaces like Kostenki and Sungir as much as thirty-two thousand years ago.Thus it is exciting to think that the legacy of these technologically advancedsocieties of the Upper Paleolithic might have had some influence on the eventsthat led eventually to the construction of Göbekli Tepe during the tenthmillennium BC. It is a surmise strengthened in the knowledge that one of theonly known uses of carved stone blocks prior to the Neolithic age was among theSolutrean cave artists of southwest Europe.SOLUTREAN STONE FRIEZESIn the collapsed rock shelter of Roc-de-Sers, located in France’sPoitou-Charente region, in the southwest of the country, archaeologists in the1920s uncovered a series of huge limestone blocks, their front faces coveredwith deeply carved bas-reliefs of Ice Age animals and human forms. Ibexes, deer,bison, and boars are represented, as are reindeer and horses. All come togetherto form part of a multipiece rock frieze originally positioned in a semicircleon a natural ledge located at the rear of the shelter. In addition to this,lumps of manganese used to create a black pigment for painting were also foundat Roc-de-Sers, suggesting that its elaborate rock frieze was originally paintedin some manner. This incredible stone art, thought to be around nineteenthousand years old, has been firmly identified as belonging to the Solutreanoccupation of the shelter, even though it would not look out of place among thegothic architecture of Chartres Cathedral or Notre Dame de Paris (see figure21.2).Two more carved stone blocks were found at the Fourneau du Diable rock shelterin France’s Dordogne region, and these have also been identified as belonging tothe Solutrean tradition. In addition to this, archaeologists found within theSolutrean layers in the Cueva del Parpalló rock shelter, situated on the slopesof Montdúber Mountain in Valencia, Spain, literally thousands of painted stoneslabs.[images/00128.jpg]Figure 21.2. Carved stone block from the Roc-de-Sers shelter in France’sPoitou-Charente region, showing a horse (on the left), and bull, its headrecarved as a boar. Solutrean period, ca. 17,000 BC.Although direct evidence of ritual activity, and even burials, is sadly lackingwhen it comes to the Solutreans, it is proposed that the “placement of engravedblocks at some sites, the accumulation of painted slabs at Parpalló, and eventhe abundance of elaborate worked stone points at a number of sites all reflectsome type of ceremonial or ritual activities.”13[index_split_058.html#filepos973049] In other words, the unique rock friezesfound at Solutrean sites might well have had a magico-religious function similarto that of the decorated T-shaped pillars at Göbekli Tepe.PURSUED BY A BULLOne block is of particular significance at Roc-de-Sers. It shows a human figure,a male it seems, with a pudding-basin haircut and slightly bent legs (see figure21.3). He appears to be either baiting or escaping from a pursuer in the form ofa huge musk ox, its three-dimensional head lowered in readiness to charge. Theclear relationship between this human form and an aggressive bovine has led tocomparisons with the Shaft Scene in the Lascaux Caves. This, as we shall recall,shows a reclining birdman being confronted by a wounded bison.[images/00133.jpg]Figure 21.3. Left, drawing showing a musk ox pursuing a human figure from therock frieze found at Roc-de-Sers. Right, the aforementioned human figure as seenon the rock frieze. Solutrean period, ca. 17,000 BC.Yet the connection with Lascaux goes deeper, for stylistic and dating evidenceindicates that its famous Shaft Scene was executed not by Magdalenian caveartists, as most prehistorians assume, but by Solutreans who entered the wellshaft as early as 16,500 BC.14 [index_split_058.html#filepos973182]SOLUTREAN BIRD CULT?More incredibly, the only other human figure depicted among the stone blocksforming the frieze at Roc-de-Sers appears to be wearing a bird mask. It iscarved on the very same block as the aforementioned musk ox and figure withpudding-basin haircut. This mask-wearing figure, which also has slightly bentlegs, might well have an erect phallus, like the birdman in Lascaux’s ShaftScene (see figure 21.4 on p. 186 to judge for yourself). Clearly, bird totemism,perhaps involving ecstatic states and mask-wearing rituals, could have beenimportant to the Solutrean peoples of southwest Europe.This conclusion is strengthened by the presence in various caves decoratedduring the Solutrean period of a strange abstract symbol known as the aviform.This is a long, thick, horizontal line, with downward-turned lines at each endand a vertical extension, either up or down, at its center.Aviform means “birdlike,” and there is no denying the birdlike appearance ofthese devices, which are found so often that they might well be a sign ofrecognition among a particular Solutrean grouping or subculture. Yet if theseare birds, then their downturned outer wings suggest they have adopted a glidingposition, usually seen when birds are kept aloft by thermals generated bycolumns of warm air (see figure 21.5). It is a method of flight usedparticularly by raptors, vultures, seagulls, and storks, as well as by smallerbirds such as swallows and swifts. Thus the aviform could represent eitherastral flight or the soul of the shaman in the form of a bird.THE SKY PEOPLEMaybe it was believed that a mask-wearing shaman could project his or her soulinto a soaring bird to observe the herd animals below, providing vitalinformation in advance of the chase. In this manner, high-flying birds takingadvantage of warm air thermals might themselves have been identified as shamansthat had adopted an avian form. If correct, then with the existence of thebirdmen at Lascaux and Roc-de-Sers, we could be looking at evidence among theSolutreans of a semiorganized cult of the bird, which might easily have becomeassociated not just with the sky but also with an imagined sky pole linked tothe cosmic axis, something that seems depicted in the Lascaux Shaft Scene.Perhaps the Solutreans were the original sky people, with the aviform a visiblesign of their sky-based religion.[images/00016.jpg]Figure 21.4. Comparison of different bird-headed figures: left, the birdman fromthe Lascaux Shaft Scene, Solutrean period, ca. 16,500–15,000 BC; center, birdmanfrom the rock frieze at Roc-de-Sers, Solutrean period, ca. 17,000 BC; and,right, ceramic bird goddess from the Vinča culture of southeast Europe, ca.5500–4500 BC.[images/00031.jpg]Figure 21.5. Left, two examples of Solutrean aviform signs from the Grotte duPlacard rock shelter in France’s Poitou-Charente region, ca. 18,000 BC, and,right, a silhouetted kite gliding in flight for comparison.That the Lascaux Shaft Scene might be the handiwork of Solutrean artists isincredibly important, for it could suggest they were carriers of the traditionthat identified Cygnus as a celestial bird, with its bright star Deneb markingthe entrance to a sky world reached through the Milky Way’s Great Rift.Remember, Deneb occupied the position of Pole Star from ca. 16,500 BC to 14,500BC, precisely when Solutrean cave artists created the Lascaux Shaft Scene.Thus it becomes possible that Solutrean knowledge regarding the execution ofstone friezes in cave sanctuaries, along with their profound understanding ofcosmic geography, bird totemism, and avian shamanism, might well have found itsway to southeast Anatolia via the Swiderians. This enabled much earliertraditions, which all had their roots in the Kostenki-Streletskaya culture ofthe Russian Plain, to flower once more with the construction of the largesanctuaries at Göbekli Tepe, an event that undoubtedly helped catalyze not justthe Neolithic revolution but also the rise of civilization.SWANS AND WOLVESDespite their compelling links to the Solutreans, the religious ideologies ofthe Swiderians have been more difficult to ascertain. The ancient rock art ofthe Russian Republic of Karelia, which borders Finland to the west, does,however, throw some light on the matter. Close to the shores of Lake Onega—wherein 1936 a nine thousand-year-old cemetery was found and identified as belongingto the post-Swiderian Kunda culture—exposed rock surfaces are covered in carvedpetroglyphs, many of which belong to the Mesolithic age. Some show swans withexaggerated necks, like long poles. Others show swans sitting on top of polesthat are being climbed by a small human figure. As at Lascaux, the poles almostcertainly symbolize axes mundi, while the human figures are perhaps the souls ofshaman travelling between the physical world and sky world. This suggests thatthe Swiderians, like the Solutreans before them, saw birds, and swans inparticular, as symbols of a sky world reached via the Cygnus constellation (abelief probably going back to a time when Cygnus marked the celestial pole, ca.16,500–13,000 BC).Interestingly, a large number of bird bones, including those of the swan, havebeen recovered from the Mesolithic cemetery of Oleni Ostrov (Reindeer Island) onLake Onega. Their deliberate placement alongside human burials has been comparedwith the shamanic practices of the indigenous Sámi population, who utilize birdand animal bones in rituals and see the spirit of the bird as associated withotherworldly journeys.15 [index_split_058.html#filepos973565] Also, as we saw inchapter 10, the swan replaces the stork in the Baltic countries as the bringerof newborn babies into the world, another intimation that the swan wasassociated with the soul’s passage to and from the sky world.Also of value is an examination of the beliefs and practices of those who muchlater occupied Swiderian territories in Central Europe. For instance, in thefirst millennium BC a collective of fierce tribal nations known as the Dacians,or Getae, inhabited the region between the Carpathian Mountains and the BlackSea, which was known as Dacia. They honored the “spirit wolf ” and sawthemselves as “wolf people.”16 [index_split_058.html#filepos973770]The Dacians venerated the wolf as “lord of the animals” and utilized itssupernatural power against all they saw as evil, in which role it became their“guardian warrior.”17 [index_split_058.html#filepos973892] In fact, the Dacians’bond with the lupine influence was so strong that they were apparently able totransform themselves into wolves to become werewolves, a connection with Romaniaand more specifically Transylvania and the Carpathian Mountains, all toofamiliar to Western popular culture. According to the Romanian historian MirceaEliade (1907–1986), the Dacians conducted carefully orchestrated ritualsfeaturing wolf pelts and psychoactive mushrooms in order to undergo “a totalpsychological transformation into wolves,” the origin most likely oflycanthropy, the belief that certain people can, quite literally, becomewolves.18 [index_split_058.html#filepos973993]Although the Dacians thrived a full nine thousand years after the Swiderianshunted the same territories, there is a distant echo of what could be a memoryof a distant cataclysm in the Dacians’ use of the Draco, or Drago, battlestandard. Its description as a wolf ’s head with the tail of a serpent and itsproposed identification as a comet19 [index_split_058.html#filepos974198] aretoo close to the Fenris Wolf ’s role in Ragnarök for this to be a simplecoincidence. Were the Geto-Dacians unconsciously recalling the manner in whichthe world was brought to its knees by a comet likened to a heavenly wolf with aserpent’s tail? If so, did they inherit these ideas from indigenous peopleswhose own ancestors inhabited the Carpathian Mountains as far back asPaleolithic times?HUNTING WITH WOLVESWhat we do know is that the Paleolithic hunters of Central and Eastern Europeactually began to work alongside wolves, training the animals to accompany themon hunting expeditions. Modern scholarship says that this act of cooperationbetween human and beast cannot be seen as simply a matter of taming friendlywolves to turn them into man’s best friend. Instead, it should be viewed as theadoption of “a new technology,” a new “weapon,”20[index_split_058.html#filepos974320] which, like the bow and arrow, would haveincreased the efficiency of the hunter during the chase. Yet from this taming ofthe wolf the relationship between human and beast emerged, and there is evidencefor this even among campsites belonging to the Swiderian hunters.*9[index_split_057.html#filepos914641]21 [index_split_058.html#filepos974555]Perhaps the Swiderians thus felt it necessary to quite literally take on themantle of the wolf to ensure both the success of the chase and the safety of theherd against predators. Then, when the comet terrorized the planet in the guiseof a sky wolf or sky fox, they played an active part in attempting to counterthe supernatural creature’s baleful influence to prevent the sky pole fromtoppling and the world from coming to an end.Might some memory of this supernatural sky creature have passed from thepost-Swiderian cultures of northeast Europe into the myths and legends of theirdescendants in Scandinavia? Was a representation of this cosmic trickster,identified in Norse myth as the Fenris Wolf, carried aloft by the Geto-Daciansin the form of the Draco battle standard, and was it this knowledge that theSwiderians took with them all the way to Göbekli Tepe? If so, what motivatedmembers of this Post-Solutrean culture to journey to such distant lands, and howexactly did they come to so strongly influence the peoples of southeastAnatolia? The answer, as we see next, seems to be the exploitation of minerals,in particular obsidian."},{"pageContent":"22OBSIDIAN OBSESSIONNot only were the Swiderians an advanced hunting society with a uniquestone-tool technology, but they also established sophisticated miningoperations, some of the only accepted examples anywhere in the world during thePaleolithic age. At various locations within the Świętokrzyskie (Holy Cross)Mountains of central Poland they extracted “exotic” forms of flint, as well ashematite, used as ochre. In addition to becoming efficient miners, theSwiderians established long-distance trading networks to export high-qualitystone tools as well as the “pre-form” cores to make new ones. Yet in addition toflint and ochre, one other mineral coveted by the Swiderians was the blackvolcanic glass known as obsidian.Obsidian is a natural glass, usually black or gray, created when volcanic lavasolidifies very quickly, without allowing any time for a crystalline matrix toform. Throughout the Middle and Upper Paleolithic ages, obsidian was a highlyprized commodity all around the world. It was used by prehistoric cultures inAfrica, Asia, the Americas, Australia, and Europe. The Solutreans also usedobsidian to create their unique projectile points.*10[index_split_057.html#filepos914892]1 [index_split_058.html#filepos975077]In Europe, there are only a handful of obsidian sources. Two can be found onsmall volcanic islands forming part of the Sicilian archipelago off the southcoast of Italy. Another is located on a tiny island off the west coast of Italy,with a further source on the island of Sardinia. There is also an importantancient source on the Greek Cycladic island of Melos (or Milos), with another onthe volcanic Greek island of Gyali, close to the southwest coast of Turkey.*11[index_split_057.html#filepos915081] The only other sources in mainland Europeare located in the Carpathian Mountains, the “land of obsidian,”2[index_split_058.html#filepos975231] within the Tokaj and Zemplén Mountains,which straddle the border between, respectively, northeast Hungary and southeastSlovakia (see figure 22.1).3 [index_split_058.html#filepos975667]†12[index_split_057.html#filepos915247][images/00047.jpg]Figure 22.1. Map of obsidian sources in Europe and southwest Asia, along withsites mentioned in connection with the distribution of obsidian in the sameregions.THE FRANCHTHI CAVEThe obsidian trade was big business in the Upper Paleolithic, with examples fromthe island of Melos reaching an occupational site known as the Franchthi Cave inthe Greek Peloponnese around 13,000 BC.4 [index_split_058.html#filepos975767]This tells us that even at this early age, obsidian was being transported acrossthe Aegean Sea from Melos to the Greek mainland, a minimum distance of 62 miles(100 kilometers).Maritime trading on this scale can only have come under the control of an elitegroup, most probably a band of complex hunter-gatherers exporting obsidianacross vast distances, initially by sea, and then by land. Professor CatherinePerlès, a prehistorian with the University of Paris, argues that the Melosobsidian trade was in the hands of “specialists,” who had the ability tonavigate a familiar sea route and knew exactly where to find the raw material onthe island.5 [index_split_058.html#filepos976173]Melos obsidian might well have been transported as far as the Balkans inNeolithic times,6 [index_split_058.html#filepos976347] confirming its incredibleimportance throughout Europe. For the Swiderians too it would seem to have helda special place in their stone kit. One survey of exotic materials found at latePaleolithic sites in the Carpathians showed that out of twenty Swiderian centersexamined, all contained items made of obsidian.7[index_split_058.html#filepos976524] The only other contemporary Carpathianpeople that would seem to have taken a noticeable fancy to obsidian were theSwiderians’ neighbors in Hungary, the Epigravettians (i.e., late Gravettians),with a large number of items made from the volcanic glass being found in theirsettlement sites as well.8 [index_split_058.html#filepos976712]LETHAL WEAPONThe Swiderians used obsidian to create super-sharp tanged points, such as theone found at a site in Wolodz, Subcarpathia, Poland.9[index_split_058.html#filepos976869] Being fashioned out of obsidian would havemade these arrowheads among the most lethal weapons in the world. So sharp isobsidian that surgeons today use scalpel blades tipped with the black volcanicglass to make near-perfect incisions during operations.Experts in Stone Age tool production often cite the story of Don Crabtree, oneof the people responsible for the rebirth of stone knapping in the 1960s and1970s.10 [index_split_058.html#filepos977123] He apparently insisted that duringan operation surgeons use obsidian blades that he himself had made. Incredibly,obsidian slices through tissue with such efficiency that it enables healing totake place easily. Metal blades, in contrast, make micro-rips in body tissuethat can take much longer to heal.CROW-FLINT FIREIt might not have been just the sharpness of obsidian that appealed to theSwiderians, or indeed their neighbors, the Epigravettians. We cannot say exactlyhow the peoples of the Upper Paleolithic viewed obsidian on a subtle level, butthe fact that it was found on the slopes of volcanoes, some of which might stillhave been active, tells us that it could have been associated with the elementof fire.Indeed, Hungarians living in the Carpathian Basin would use obsidian—picked upat prehistoric settlement sites—to kindle fire. They referred to it asvarjúkova, “crow-flint,”11 [index_split_058.html#filepos977284] as well as istennyila, “thunder bolts” (or “godly arrowheads”),12[index_split_058.html#filepos977707] associating it with the god of thunder andlightning. They even described obsidian as lebkövek, “meteorite-like stones,” inthe belief that these shiny gray or black pieces of rock came from the sky.13[index_split_058.html#filepos977808]OBSIDIAN RELIGIONIn Mesoamerican tradition obsidian was said to be blood that had congealed andgone black. Both the Aztecs and Maya used obsidian to create sacrificial knives,as well as blades and implements for autosacrifice; that is, bloodlettingthrough self-inflicted incisions.Scottish folklorist Lewis Spence (1874–1955) wrote in The Magic and Mysteries ofMexico (1922) that the Mesoamerican fixation with obsidian—what he called the“obsidian religion”—emerged from an epoch of human history when prehistorichunters used obsidian weapons to hunt deer:> The deer was slain by the obsidian weapon, which, therefore, came to be> regarded as the magical weapon, that by which food was procured [by the> prehistoric hunters of Mexico]. In the course of time it assumed a sacred> significance, the hunting-gods themselves came to wield it, and it [obsidian]> was thought of as coming from the stars or the heavens where the gods dwelt.14> [index_split_058.html#filepos977980]Even though Mexico lies thousands of miles away from the Carpathian Mountains,can we envisage the existence of similar beliefs in the magical potency ofobsidian among the Upper Paleolithic peoples of Central and Eastern Europe? Didthe Swiderians see obsidian as a magical weapon, linked integrally with theirrole as reindeer hunters?THE SEARCH FOR NEW SOURCESIn all likelihood, the Swiderians’ fascination with obsidian could suggest theyhad some kind of control over its collection and distribution in the CarpathianMountains, the “land of obsidian,” prior to any kind of forced migration tonorth and northeast Europe caused either by the Younger Dryas Boundary impactevent, ca. 10,900 BC, or the thirteen-hundred-year mini ice age that followedit. Not only was obsidian to be found in the Caucasus Mountains, which theSwiderians reached as early as the eleventh millennium BC, but as we see next,it was the sources in and around the Armenian Highlands that become crucial tomaking the connection between the Swiderians and the power elite thought to bebehind the construction of Göbekli Tepe."},{"pageContent":"23THE BINGÖL MASTERSIn 2008 it was determined that obsidian tools found at Göbekli Tepe derive fromthree primary sources—one of them being Göllü Dağ in central Anatolia, wherethere are several major sources of obsidian, with the other two coming fromlocations near Bingöl Mountain.1 [index_split_058.html#filepos978207] This is anorth-south aligned massif with twin peaks located some 30 miles (50 kilometers)south of the city of Erzurum in the Armenian Highlands of eastern Anatolia.A separate survey completed in 2012 determined that another source of the rawmaterial used to fashion many of the obsidian tools and blades found at GöbekliTepe was Nemrut Dağ, an extinct volcano close to Lake Van, Turkey’s largestinland sea, which lies to the southeast of the Armenian Highlands.2[index_split_058.html#filepos978674] This latest discovery has led tospeculation that Göbekli Tepe might have been a cosmopolitan center, a kind ofNeolithic Mecca or Jerusalem for people coming from central Anatolia, some 280miles (450 kilometers) away, and from the Bingöl/Lake Van area, which liesaround 200 miles (320 kilometers) to the northeast.3[index_split_058.html#filepos979073]Supporting evidence for the cosmopolitan center theory includes the countlessflint tools found scattered about Göbekli Tepe’s artificial mound, which arehardly likely to have been dropped by the builders. They are everywhere; youcannot help but tread on them. The sheer quantity suggests they are offeringsleft by visitors across an extended period of time.Clearly, Göbekli Tepe was a center of pilgrimage. However, the presence here ofobsidian tools from central Anatolia and the Bingöl/Lake Van area might wellhave other implications. As we have seen in Mexico, Central Europe, and Greece,obsidian was a prestige item, one endowed with great magical properties,including the ability to produce fire. Its presence at Göbekli Tepe tells us twothings: first, that it might have been employed in rituals due to its specialqualities, and, second, there must have been lines of communication betweenGöbekli Tepe and the obsidian sources in the Bingöl/Lake Van area. Thisconnection with Bingöl Mountain in particular was most obviously throughproto-Neolithic centers such as Hallan Çemi in the foothills of the easternTaurus Mountains, which dates to ca. 10,250–9600 BC, and Çayönü, ca. 8650–7350BC, both of which acted as clearinghouses for obsidian reaching southeastAnatolia from the Armenian Highlands.THE EMERGENCE OF HALLAN ÇEMIHallan Çemi exhibited a level of cultural sophistication that easily matchedanything going on in the Levant at this time. Although the people here werehunters and foragers, eating wild game (mostly sheep, goats, red deer, foxes,and turtles), they would appear to have domesticated the pig, the earliestevidence of this form of animal husbandry anywhere in the world.The discovery of a substantial number of stone querns, used to grind seeds, hasled some prehistorians to suggest that the inhabitants of Hallan Çemi wereengaged in protoagriculture, or certainly the exploitation of wild cereals.However, very few cereal seeds have been found at the site, casting doubts onthis theory. In fact, all the indications are that the main food here, inaddition to game meat, consisted of wild lentils, bitter vetch (a type of pea),and nuts. These included pistachios and wild almonds, which had first to beroasted before consumption to remove their toxicity. Evidence of pistachio andalmond consumption has also been found at Göbekli Tepe.Excavators at Hallan Çemi worked frantically to explore the site from 1991 to1994 in advance of its disappearance beneath the rising waters of the nearbyBatman River, following the construction of a nearby dam. Before its finalsubmergence they were able to uncover two semisubterranean, circular structuresof great significance. Each one was around 20 feet (6 meters) in diameter, withwalls faced with sandstone ashlars, as well as stone benches, plastered floors,and central hearths. Archaeologists found inside them a large number of prestigeitems, including pieces of copper ore and obsidian tools, along with evidence offood preparation, most likely for ceremonial feasts cooked on the hearths.One of the structures contained a massive auroch’s skull, which had hung at itsnorthern end, indicating that the building was almost certainly used for culticpurposes. The discovery of this bucranium supports the theory that the north wasthe preferred direction of orientation of proto-Neolithic cult buildings evenbefore the construction of much more complex structures at both Göbekli Tepe andÇayönü.Indeed, there is a good case for Hallan Çemi having some direct bearing on whatcame later at Göbekli Tepe, as does the basic design and carved art of othercult centers in the region, such as Jerf el-Ahmar in North Syria and Qermez Derein the Jezirah Desert of northern Iraq (see chapter 1).Hallan Çemi, where almost half the stone tools found were made of obsidian, is75 miles (120 kilometers) south-southwest of Bingöl Mountain and just under 140miles (225 kilometers) away from Göbekli Tepe. To date, Hallan Çemi is theclosest known proto-Neolithic site to Bingöl, and the sheer amount of obsidianfound here has prompted prehistorians to suggest that trade networks must haveexisted across the region. If so, then Hallan Çemi was very likely a maindistribution center, the raw obsidian arriving here from workshops much closerto the mountain.EUROPEAN TAKEOVERThese realizations take us into interesting territories, for if the trade inobsidian was indeed regulated by some kind of elite group, is it possible thatSwiderian peoples entered eastern Anatolia from the north during the YoungerDryas period and assumed control of the regional obsidian trade, introducing newforms of tool manufacture, such as the pressure flaking technique? Curiously,this is the exact same time that the local culture, the Zarzian, vanish from thescene, having thrived in the region for as much as nine thousand years.The Zarzians are a very compelling group. Not only were they the founders ofHallan Çemi, but evidence suggests they also domesticated dogs.4[index_split_058.html#filepos979173] In addition to this, they were one of thefirst cultures in the Middle East to employ the use of bows and arrows, whichthey utilized to hunt red deer, onager (or wild ass), cattle, sheep, and wildgoats. They kept on the move, living mainly in temporary campsites, and mostimportant of all, they had access to major obsidian sources in the ArmenianHighlands.Obsidian from the Bingöl sources has been found at various Zarzian camps as farsouth as the Zagros Mountains, including the cave of Zarzi (the culture’s typesite), near Sulaymaniah in Iraqi Kurdistan, and the Zawi Chemi Shanidarsettlement site, which overlooks the Greater Zab River in northern Iraq. It washere during the 1950s that American archaeologists Ralph and Rose Soleckidiscovered the wings of seventeen large predatory birds, mostly vultures, alongwith the skulls of at least fifteen goats and wild sheep (see chapter 9).Although this ritual deposit is assigned to the proto-Neolithic community thatoccupied the site, chances are it represents a continuation of beliefs andpractices that had been prevalent among the Zarzian peoples, whose legacy livedon among the proto-Neolithic populations of southeast Anatolia and northernIraq. In other words, the Zarzians were most likely carriers of the traditionthat included the utilization of the vulture in shamanic practices, somethingthat later appears at cult centers such as Göbekli Tepe and Nevalı Çori. This isdespite the fact that the Swiderians held specific knowledge regarding bird-andcanine-related shamanism derived, at least in part, from both their suspectedSolutrean background and their likely contact with the descendants of theKostenki-Streletskaya culture of the Russian steppes and plain, whom they wouldhave encountered on their journey to eastern Anatolia. Yet their beliefs andpractices do not appear to have included the use of the vulture as a primarysymbol of birth, death, and rebirth. That seems to have come from the Zarzianpeoples, who occupied the region before their arrival.As to their origin, British archaeologist James Mellaart felt that the Zarzianshad started their journey on the Russian steppes, then moved gradually southwardinto the Caucasian Mountains and Armenian Highlands, before eventually reachingthe Zagros Mountains of northern Iraq and northwest Iran.5[index_split_058.html#filepos979303] Yet this was a migration that had startedas early as 19,000 BC, as much as nine thousand years before the Swiderianswould appear to have traveled exactly the same route to reach eastern Anatoliaduring the Younger Dryas period.So did the Swiderian hunters overrun Zarzian camps, decimating the inhabitants?Certainly, there is compelling evidence that some kind of power struggleoccurred around this time in the Zarzian territories of Gobustan in Azerbaijan,right where the eastern termination of the Caucasus Mountains meets the CaspianSea.THE GOBUSTAN WARRIORSRock art in the Gobustan (or Kobystan) National Park, located 40 miles (64kilometers) southwest of the Azerbaijani capital of Baku, shows warriors withbows and arrows slung across their backs (see figure 23.1). Some figures appearto be wearing fringed waistbands and even animal loincloths with the tailshanging between their legs, similar to those seen on the anthropomorphic twinpillars in Göbekli Tepe’s Enclosure D.[images/00064.jpg]Figure 23.1. Rock art from Gobustan, Azerbaijan, close to the west coast of theCaspian Sea, showing warriors wielding bows and arrows. Mesolithic period, ca.eleventh to tenth millennium BC. The boat in the upper register is thought tohave been added at a later date.The lifelike manner in which the warriors are drawn, with smaller figures behindthem, gives the impression of arrival—as if they are arriving from somewhereelse in the ancient world. This seems emphasized by the fact that in thebackground of some of the engraved panels are high-prowed boats of a type commonto the Neolithic rock art of Egypt’s Eastern Desert and the Bronze Age rock artof Scandinavia. So much do these vessels resemble those of later cultures thatprehistorians suggest that, whereas the Gobustan warriors are “early Mesolithicage at the latest,”6 [index_split_058.html#filepos979459] thus ca. 9600–9000 BC,the vessels were added later, most probably during the Bronze Age.Mary Settegast, the author of Plato Prehistorian, argues that the Gobustan rockart shows the arrival of incoming warriors, most likely bow-and-arrow-wieldingreindeer hunters from Europe.7 [index_split_058.html#filepos979596] So are welooking at Swiderians seizing control of Zarzian territories? Whoever thesewarriors represent, their presence would not seem to have been greetedcordially, for some of the engraved panels show open conflict between twoseparate groups of individuals.Even if the Gobustan rock art does show Swiderian hunters coming up againsttheir Zarzian counterparts, there is no reason to assume that one decimated theother. Perhaps after some initial skirmishes, the two factions came to some kindof understanding regarding the exploitation of the region’s rich mineralresources, including the all-important obsidian. In doing so, it is possiblethat the Zarzians amalgamated with the incoming European hunters to become thedriving force behind the emergence of the proto-Neolithic world at keysettlements like Hallan Çemi in the Eastern Taurus Mountains. As mentionedearlier, Hallan Çemi acted as a workshop and clearinghouse for obsidian comingfrom Bingöl Mountain and Lake Van, and so its Zarzian vulture shamans might wellhave had some hand in the rise of early Neolithic cult centers in the triangled’or such as Göbekli Tepe, Çayönü, and Nevalı Çori.DISTANT COUSINSIf the Zarzians did come originally from the Russian steppes, as James Mellaartsuspected, sometime around ca. 19,000 BC, the chances are they were related tothe highly advanced Kostenki-Streletskaya culture, which disappears aroundexactly the same time. So if the Solutreans and their proposed successors, theSwiderians, really were related to the Kostenki-Streletskaya culture (as wasproposed by V. Gordon Childe, see chapter 21), then it means that the Zarzianswere in fact distant cousins of the Swiderians, a factor that might just haveallowed them to find some common ground. Both used bows and arrows, and bothmight well have domesticated dogs and/or wolves, while the Kostenki-Streletskayaculture is thought to have held a special interest in the fox, one of theprimary totemic animals seen at Göbekli Tepe.For example, a male burial uncovered at Sungir in Russia in 1956 (designatedSungir 1) had a number of perforated arctic fox teeth on his cranium whenuncovered, suggesting they were sewn into a cap of some sort. Another burial ofa boy aged around thirteen (Sungir 2), interred in a shallow grave head-to-headwith an adolescent female (Sungir 3), was found to have around 250 drilledarctic fox teeth around his waist. These probably came from a decorated belt,similar to those seen on the central pillars in Göbekli Tepe’s Enclosure D.Burials at Kostenki itself have also been found to contain unusual amounts ofteeth and bones of the arctic fox. This includes the 150 fox teeth found wrappedaround the head of a child, aged about six to seven years old, uncovered at asite known as Kostenki 15. Covering the burial was a huge mammoth scapula(shoulder blade), a feature common also among the contemporary, andunquestionably related, Pavlovian culture of Moravia. Today Moravia is part ofthe Czech Republic, which includes the sites of Brünn (modern Brno) andPÅ™edmost, where evidence of the Brünn-type human population was reported in thenineteenth century.Among the Pavlovians—their name deriving from Pavlov, a village situated in thePavlov Hills, around 22 miles (35 kilometers) from the city of Brno—the arcticfox also features heavily among burials. At a site named Dolní VÄ›stonice onechild burial contained twenty-seven arctic fox teeth, while a triple burial madeup of two men, with a woman in between them, revealed that both males had beenwearing headdresses of arctic fox teeth when interred. Within the mass graveuncovered at PÅ™edmost in 1894 (see chapter 20), excavators came across largeamounts of wolf and fox remains, which seemed to line the perimeter of the pit.Among the remains were a number of unperforated arctic fox canines as well asvarious wolf skulls. Most pertinently, a woman, aged around forty, discovered atDolní VÄ›stonice site 1, and known popularly as “the shamaness,” was found to beholding five unperforated fox incisors in her right hand and various fox bonesin her left hand.Although the use of wolf and arctic fox remains as items of personal adornmentamong the Eastern Gravettians, ca. thirty-two thousand to twenty-one thousandyears ago, might easily be attributed to the large-scale capture of thesecarnivores for their meat and pelts, the presence in the graves of unperforatedfox teeth hints at the importance of this animal on a cosmological level.Arguably the arctic fox, and the wolf also, was seen as an otherworldly creaturethat needed to be appeased by the newly dead on their journey into theafterlife. Such ideas, if realistic, might easily have been inherited by thedescendants of the Eastern Gravettians, including the Swiderians, who came tooccupy the same territories during the Younger Dryas period.Should this quite fantastic scenario prove realistic, then it seems likely thatincoming Swiderian groups entered eastern Anatolia and assumed control of theobsidian trade, giving them direct access to settlement sites not just in theEastern Taurus range and Zagros Mountains, but also in southeast Anatolia, muchcloser to Göbekli Tepe. Now they were in a position to introduce their ownreligious ideologies to the local inhabitants, which would seem to have includednew ways to counter the baleful actions of the cosmic trickster in its guise asthe sky wolf or sky fox.Because the center of the Armenian obsidian trade was Bingöl Mountain, there isevery chance that this is one of the locations the Swiderian hunters settled sothat they could exploit their newly acquired sources of exotic materials,including the all-important obsidian find sites. If this is correct, then weshould find evidence of their presence in this region, and this, as we see next,is exactly what we do find."},{"pageContent":"24WOLF STONE MOUNTAINIn the religion of Zoroastrianism, a native form of which flourished inhistorical Armenia before the spread of Christianity in the fourth century, thewolf was an animal of Ahriman, the evil principle, who engages in a constantstruggle with Ohrmazd (also known as Ahura Mazda), the creator of the universe.The Bundahishn, one of the holy books of the Zoroastrian faith, speaks of howAhriman planned to create the wolf species as “disembodied, unseen evilspirits.” Yet Ohrmazd got wind of Ahriman’s plan and created the wolf himself,along with the elephant and the lion, which were all made creatures of the evilprinciple.Ormuzd showed what he had done to Ahriman, who being pleased, “attached the evilspirits to these forms saying, ‘Ohrmazd did what I was going to do.’”1[index_split_058.html#filepos979784] Elsewhere, Ahriman is cited as theprogenitor of the “wolf species,” the leader of whom is the lion,2[index_split_058.html#filepos979944] a predator interchangeable with the wolf inthe Zoroastrian tradition.There is a reason for citing these facts, for in historical Armenia, the regionwe know today as eastern Turkey (the modern Republic of Armenia lies immediatelynorth of here), there once existed a mountain called Gaylaxaz-ut, which means“abounding in gaylaxaz,” or “wolf ’s stone” (from gayl, “wolf ”).3[index_split_058.html#filepos980066] Usually this refers to flint, the principalmaterial used during the Stone Age to make tools and weapons. Yet gaylaxaz canalso mean obsidian,4 [index_split_058.html#filepos980463] even though inArmenian tradition this black volcanic glass is known also as satani elung,“Satan’s nail,”5 [index_split_058.html#filepos980579] or perhaps “Satan’sclaw.”*13 [index_split_057.html#filepos915467]SERVANTS OF SATANPreviously, Gaylaxaz-ut had been called Paxray,6[index_split_058.html#filepos980694] which in the Armenian language means “hind,deer, stag,”7 [index_split_058.html#filepos980847] with the deer being acreature synonymous in local folk tradition with both Satan and the wolf.8[index_split_058.html#filepos980968] Aristakes Lastivertc’i, an eleventh-centuryArmenian cleric and historian, relates an archaic story that speaks of how onthis mountain a “village” was established named Xač (pronounced something like“hack”), which means “holy cross.” This was destroyed, he said, by the “servantsof the Satan,”9 [index_split_058.html#filepos981088] who afterward returned “totheir snake-dwelling lairs,”10 [index_split_058.html#filepos981203] locatedelsewhere on the mountain.Trying to get to the bottom of this strange story, Armenian linguist Hrach K.Martirosyan wondered whether the mountain Gaylaxaz-ut might be Baghir Dağ,11[index_split_058.html#filepos981315] a peak at the end of a mountain chain tothe west of Bingöl Mountain. On its eastern side is the ominously named ShaitanDağ, “Satan’s Mountain,” leading Martirosyan to ask:> Bearing in mind that the mountain of Paxray = Gaylaxaz-ut is said to be> dwelled by “servants of the Satan” [in “snake-dwelling lairs”], one may assume> that the “devilish fame/nature” of the mountain is conditioned by the> abundance of gaylaxaz-stones as is seen in the name of the mountain and is> also reflected in its earlier name Paxray, if this indeed is identic with> paxray “hind, deer.”12 [index_split_058.html#filepos981427]In other words, the name Gaylaxaz-ut alludes, most probably, to a mountain where“gaylaxaz-stones,” that is, flint or obsidian, is found, and that the “servantsof the Satan” are in fact reflections of the mountain’s inhabitants. AlthoughMartirosyan identifies this location with Baghir Dağ,13[index_split_058.html#filepos981539] there are no notable flint or obsidiansources nearby. More likely is that Gaylaxaz-ut, which quite literally meansWolf Stone Mountain, is Bingöl Mountain, around 45 miles (72 kilometers) east ofShaitan Dağ. This, as we saw in chapter 23, has been the region’s primary sourceof obsidian since Paleolithic times.Confirmation that Gaylaxaz-ut is Bingöl Mountain comes from its earlier name ofPaxray, recorded also as Paxir, Parxar, and Parxaray.14[index_split_058.html#filepos981984] According to the Roman naturalist andphilosopher Pliny the Elder (AD 23–79), the beginning of the Euphrates on MonteAba (an ancient name for Bingöl Mountain) was called the Pyxirates,15[index_split_058.html#filepos982142] which almost certainly derives from thesame root as Paxray, suggesting that Bingöl Mountain really is Gaylaxaz-ut, WolfStone Mountain.That obsidian was known in Armenia as wolf’s stone implies, quite clearly, thatthe creature was associated in some manner with this black volcanic glass. Mightthe wolves not have been animals originally, but groups or individuals whoidentified themselves with the wolf and prized this black volcanic glass? Didthe memory of these “wolves” degenerate over time until they became nothing morethan the “servants of the Satan,” minions of the Zoroastrian evil principleAhriman, who lived in “snake-dwelling lairs” on Wolf Stone Mountain?LAND OF THE PERIThat mythical beings associated both with obsidian and the wolf might once haveinhabited the region is affirmed by the fact that one of the rivers that takesits rise on Bingöl Mountain is the Peri Şu, which means “river of the Peri,”with Peri being “one of a large group of beautiful, fairy-like beings of Persianmythology.”16 [index_split_058.html#filepos982325] Peri Şu is the river’s namein the local Kurdish language, although to the region’s Armenian population itis the Gail, or Kyle, from gayl, meaning “wolf.”17[index_split_058.html#filepos982561] Linking the wolf still further with Bingölis a narrow gorge through which the fledgling river passes after leaving themountain, which is called in Turkish Kurt-Duzi, meaning “wolf (kurt) plain(duzi).”18 [index_split_058.html#filepos982723]So how then did a river named Gail, or wolf, come to be called Peri Şu by theregion’s Kurdish inhabitants, and did this information have any obvious bearingon Bingöl’s long association with obsidian?Kurdish folklore asserts that the mountains and valleys around the Peri Şu wereonce the haunt of the Peri, the offspring of fallen angels in Persian myth andlegend. They are said to have been tall, strong, beautiful, “super human beingsthat could cohabit with mortal kind.”*14 [index_split_057.html#filepos915792]19[index_split_058.html#filepos982952] It was even believed that certaincommunities of Kurds, particularly those that included pale-looking females,were the descendants of Peri that had mated with mortal kind. 20[index_split_058.html#filepos983107] According to a Kurd who was born and raisedin a rural village close to the obsidian route between Bingöl and Diyarbakır,the Peri were linked to the local obsidian trade in stories once told by themost elderly members of the community.21 [index_split_058.html#filepos983283]How exactly, unfortunately, has now been lost.Yet the fact that the Peri Şu, or Gail River, rises on Bingöl Mountain linksthese various traditions with mythical individuals who might well have beenidentified not only with the Peri of Kurdish folklore, but also with both thewolf and obsidian. It is even possible that we have here a dim recollection ofthe arrival in the region of Swiderian peoples from central and eastern Europe.If all this is correct, then how would these European hunters, whose totemanimals included the wolf and reindeer, convince the indigenous peoples ofsoutheast Anatolia to embark on the construction of monumental architectureunlike anything ever seen before in the ancient world? It is time now to examinejust how exactly the hunting magic of the Swiderians might have gone on toinfluence the strange world that emerged at Göbekli Tepe in the aftermath of theYounger Dryas mini ice age ca. 9600–9500 BC."},{"pageContent":"25SAVIORS OF THE WORLDPolish anthropologist Maria Czaplicka (1884–1921) made a study of the Koryakreindeer herders of Siberia’s Kamchatka Krai, which is in the extreme northeastof Russia (a krai is a federal subject, or political division, of Russia). Oneceremony she recorded involved the slaughter of a wolf and then the killing of areindeer. The latter was decapitated, and its head and body placed alongsidethat of the slain wolf on a raised platform. The rite was a sacrifice toGicholan, “The-One-on-High,” the Koryak supreme being, upon whom they called toprevent the wolf from attacking the herd. A feast was afterward prepared andeaten, at which “the wolf is fed”; that is, its spirit was appeased. Czaplickagoes on:> The night is spent without sleep, in beating the drum, and dancing to> entertain the wolf, lest his relatives come and take revenge. Beating the drum> and addressing themselves to the wolf, the people say, “Be well! (Nimeleu> jatvanvota!),” and addressing The-One-on-High, they say, “Be good, do not make> the wolf bad!”1 [index_split_058.html#filepos983531]Yet in answer as to whether this ritual was done to ward off wolves, the Koryakinsisted that the animal was not dangerous in its visible state, especially asthe northern wolf generally avoids human contact. Czaplicka said it wasdangerous only in its “invisible, anthropomorphic form”; that is, as a werewolf,a half-human, half-wolf. With this in mind, she noted that in Koryak tradition:> The wolf is a rich reindeer-owner and the powerful master of the tundra . . .> [and] avenges [himself] particularly on those that hunt [wolves]. The Reindeer> Koryak, who have special reason to fear the wolf on account of their herds,> regard this animal as a powerful shaman and an evil spirit.2> [index_split_058.html#filepos983707]Thus for the Koryak the wolf was both a “powerful shaman and an evil spirit,” aforce to be reckoned with on a supernatural level.WOLF-STICK FESTIVALIn another ritual celebration practiced by the Koryak, called the Wolf-stickFestival (Elhogi Çayönüin), a wolf was killed, skinned, and decapitated. Movingacross to a hearth the participants would then place a pointed stick in theground, to which they would tie an arrow. Alternatively, the arrow was driveninto the earth, with its point sticking upward. A man would then adorn himselfin the wolf ’s skin and walk in circles around the hearth to the beat of a drumplayed by someone standing nearby. When questioned as to why they conducted thisritual, the Koryak would simply shrug their shoulders and say: “Our forefathersdid [it] this way.”3 [index_split_058.html#filepos983807]THE SHAMAN’S POLECzaplicka was mystified as to why during the Wolf-stick Festival the Koryakstuck a stick in the ground with an arrow tied to it or used an arrow instead.Yet an explanation is actually quite simple, for it cannot be coincidence thatshamanistic practices in Siberia, and many other parts of the world, involve theerection of a stick or pole that represents the axis mundi, the axis of theearth.The shaman’s pole, which can even be the central support of a skin-covered tent,then becomes the means by which the shaman gains entry to the sky world, eitherby ascending it in astral form and/or by actually climbing the pole, like someweird circus act in a big top. As Czaplicka herself pointed out in connectionwith the cosmological views of the Chukchi, a Siberian tribe whose territoriesborder those of the Koryak:> A hole, under the pole-star, forms a passage from one world to the other, and> through this hole shamans and spirits pass from one to another of the worlds.4> [index_split_058.html#filepos983987]Such beliefs and practices are likely to have existed in Paleolithic times, andif this is correct, then there is no reason they cannot have survived into themodern era in remote parts of Siberia. The existence of rituals such as theWolf-stick Festival of the Koryak demonstrates the absolute necessity of atribal group in countering the malefic intentions of their enemies; not here,but in the spirit world, where they can be confronted head-on by the shaman, whomight well take on the mantle of the wolf to deal directly with a feared andrespected rival or enemy.OCCULT BATTLEThese are psychological processes most assuredly, but it is as well to recallthat during the Second World War British witches and occultists—most famouslyDion Fortune (1890–1946), who lived at Glastonbury at the time—became entangledin what they saw as a magical battle of life and death in order to counteractthe threat of Nazi Germany to British freedom. Those taking part conductedregular rituals, meditations, and psychic battles to ensure an Allied victory.These individuals believed that what they were doing was very real indeed, andno amount of skepticism would have convinced them otherwise. It is extremelylikely that something similar was going on in the aftermath of the Younger DryasBoundary impact event involving European reindeer hunters and wolf shamanscountering the baleful influence of the cosmic trickster in the form of the wolfor fox.Did the Paleolithic peoples eventually claim victory over the forces of the skywolf, or sky fox, in a manner echoed in the outcome of the Scandinavian accountof Ragnarök, the Twilight of the Gods? Did their claims, handed down from onegeneration to the next, have any bearing on the story of how the god Tíw, orTyr, sacrificed his right arm in order that the Fenris Wolf might be boundforever, saving the lives not just of the remaining Æsir, or Asa gods, but alsothe fledgling strains of humanity? Remember, this was seen as a compassionateact of self-sacrifice that gained Tíw the epithet “leavings of the wolf.”Not only was Tíw considered a divine protector of the North Star or celestialpole, but his symbol, the T-rune Tiwaz, is the outline of an arrow, and, as wesaw in chapter 16, a representation of the “vault of heaven held up by theuniversal column,”5 [index_split_058.html#filepos984093] as well as theIrminsul, or “world-column of the Saxons that terminates in the pole star.”6[index_split_058.html#filepos984217] The symbolism is thus the same as the arrowand pole used in the Koryak Wolf-stick Festival, with all of it being done tocounter the trickster wolf and ensure the future stability of the world.STRANGE CUSTOMS OF THE SÁMIFurther evidence of this surmise comes from the Sámi, the shamanic-based tribalculture and, until fairly recently, reindeer herders who have existed inFinland, northern Scandinavia, and the Kola Peninsula of Russia since Mesolithictimes (see figure 25.1 on p. 211). According to noted Swedish ethnologist UnoHarva (1882–1949), the Sámi practiced a “strange custom” whereby they madesacrifices to a sky god “so the sky or the world would not fall down.”7[index_split_058.html#filepos984322] For this they erected a forked tree, ortall pole, on the top of which they placed an iron nail, symbolizing the “worldpillar,” next to which an altar was created so that the god “could support andkeep the world, that it would not grow old and fall from its former position.”8[index_split_058.html#filepos984505] Harva compared the Sámi’s sky pole with theIrminsul of the Saxons, linking it back to the Tiwaz rune, which was known bothto the Scandinavians and the Germanic peoples.9[index_split_058.html#filepos984605]According to an eighteenth-century missionary named Jens Kildal (1683–1767), theNorwegian Sámi believed in a high god called Maylmen Radien, in whose honor aworld pillar or axis mundi called Maylmen Stytto was erected and “smeared withthe blood of a sacrificial reindeer oxen.”10[index_split_058.html#filepos984705]Here we have clear evidence of shamanic rituals taking place among the Sámi topreserve the stability of the sky pole, or world pillar (the Maylmen Stytto wasthought to connect with the celestial pole). This was done in order that itmight “not grow old and fall from its former position” or that “the sky or theworld would not fall down”; that is, so that it would not be destroyed, eitherthrough neglect or, might we say, through the intrusion of some kind ofsupernatural agency, such as a sky wolf or sky fox*15[index_split_057.html#filepos916889] (the reindeer, wolf, and fox are keyanimals depicted on Sámi shaman drums, alongside a central cross variouslydescribed as the world tree [Saiva Moura], the world pillar [Maylmen Stytto],and even the Cross of Christ).[images/00081.jpg]Figure 25.1. Antique line drawing showing Sámi reindeer herders.FINNO-UGRIC ORIGINSThe significant point about the Sámi is that they belong to an ethnic group thatforms part of the Finno-Ugric language family. Not only is there a relationshipbetween the Finno-Ugric language and both Armenian and Hungarian, but there isevidence also that the Sámi inherited traditions from a post-Swiderian cultureresponsible for the spread of the Finno-Ugric group of languages intoScandinavia, Estonia, and Finland.11 [index_split_058.html#filepos984806]Thus there exists some small chance that the beliefs and practices of the Sámiowe some debt to those practiced by the Swiderian reindeer hunters, including,we can only assume, shamanic rites to preserve the stability of the sky pole sothat the world does not come to an end.With all this in mind, can we go on to imagine Swiderian groups reaching theArmenian Highlands in the wake of the catastrophic events that would appear tohave affected the world in the eleventh millennium BC and claiming that theirhunting magic and their understanding of the sky wolf or sky fox, had, quiteliterally, brought humankind back from the brink of destruction? Did they offerto reveal how the hunter-gatherers of southeast Anatolia could themselvesstabilize the world pillar and counter the baleful influence of the cosmictrickster so that “the sky or the world would not fall down”?Such speculation might seem crazy, but we have to imagine ourselves in theposition of the hunter-gatherers of southeast Anatolia at the end of thePaleolithic age and attempt to understand why they might have embarked onmammoth building projects such as Göbekli Tepe. If the large enclosures, builtca. 9500–8900 BC, are not the end product of hundreds, if not thousands, ofyears of gradual evolution, then it is possible they were inspired not only bythe fear of a further cataclysm taking place but also by new ideas carried intothe region by outsiders. As we have seen, by far the best candidates for thisrole are the Swiderians, who would seem to have been carrying traditionsinherited from their likely forebears, the Solutreans and Kestenki-Streletskayaculture of the Russian Plain, in particular a knowledge of cosmic geography andshamanistic practices involving the concept of the sky pole used to reach a skyworld existing in the area of the Cygnus region.FOX, NOT WOLF?One question remains before we can move on: If Fenris is a wolf, and theEuropean reindeer hunters arrived in Anatolia claiming an association with thisanimal, why don’t we see the wolf depicted more at Göbekli Tepe? The answer isthat the wolf is represented among the carved art at Göbekli Tepe. It is verylikely the identity of at least three “predators” or “quadrupeds” represented by3-D statues found at the site, which are today on display at the Şanlıurfaarchaeological museum. That said, it is the fox that predominates among thecarved art seen in the enclosures, especially on the inner faces of the centralpillars. It was this realization, along with the large number of faunal remainsbelonging to the red fox found at the site, that prompted archaeozoologist JorisPeters and Klaus Schmidt to conclude that “a specific worship of foxes may bereflected here.”12 [index_split_058.html#filepos985041]The reason behind this noticeable switch from wolf to fox, both of which wereforms of the cosmic trickster and the star Alcor in Ursa Major, is easilyexplained. Whereas the wolf was important to the reindeer hunters of the EastEuropean Plain, the fox appears to have played a cosmological role among theEastern Gravettian peoples of both Central Europe and the Russian Plain. The foxwas also important among the Natufian communities of the Levant. Here the bonesand teeth of the red fox have often been identified among the faunal remainsfound at occupation sites.13 [index_split_058.html#filepos985265]It was arguably for similar reasons that the fox and wolf were interchangeablein their role as cosmic trickster, since the animals meant different things todifferent cultures in different localities. In ancient Egyptian tradition, forexample, the trickster god is Seth, whose animistic form is the fenekh, ordesert fox, while for the Dogon of Mali in West Africa the trickster is Ogo, thepale fox.The cosmic trickster, in all its forms, whether as the wolf or fox (or, indeed,the dog, dragon, lion, or any other type of animal) has the potential to quiteliterally bring about the death of the world through the collapse of the skypole that holds up the heavens. The crucial knowledge of how to prevent thisfrom happening was, quite possibly, the all-important remedy for thecatastrophobia rife among the hunter-gatherers of southeast Anatolia in the wakeof the Younger Dryas Boundary impact event.This then was the knowledge very likely made available to the Epipaleolithicpeoples of southeast Anatolia some twelve to thirteen thousand years ago. Thosewho offered this solution were, most probably, members of a Swiderian rulingelite—hunters, warriors, tool specialists, and shamans—whose journey probablybegins as far west as Poland’s Vistula River and the obsidian sources of theCarpathian Mountains and ends with their entry into eastern Anatolia sometimeduring the Younger Dryas mini ice age, perhaps around 10,500 BC or slightlylater. They are the face of the Hooded Ones, whose own great ancestors are mostlikely immortalized in the twelvefold rings of T-shaped pillars, not just withinthe large enclosures at Göbekli Tepe but also at the various other Pre-PotteryNeolithic sites throughout the triangle d’or.Yet we still need to better understand how exactly the incoming groups ofSwiderians were able to convince the Epipaleolithic hunter-gatherers ofsoutheast Anatolia to come together to create the first truly megalithicarchitecture in human history. How did this happen? It is a matter we addressnext."},{"pageContent":"26STRANGE-LOOKING PEOPLECan we imagine the sense of fear and uncertainty that must have existed in theminds of the Epipaleolithic peoples who lived in the vicinity of Göbekli Tepeduring the Younger Dryas mini ice age, ca. 10,900–9600 BC? The golden age oncespoken about by the elders was now little more than a utopic dream. Since thegreat fire from the sky and the time of perpetual darkness and constant rain,when the land had sunk beneath the waters, the world had been an entirelydifferent place—cold, bleak, dry, and almost devoid of the herd animals that hadprovided life and sustenance to so many.It almost seemed as if the animal spirits that had addressed their every needhad now deserted them, perhaps through their misdeeds in the years leading up tothis terrible change in the world. What is more, there was no assurance thatthese great catastrophes would not happen again and again, until finally nothingmore was left, only the darkness that prevailed before time began.Then one day a group of tall, strange-looking people of striking appearance,with elongated heads, long faces, high cheekbones, strong jaws, and prominentbrow bridges due to their ancestry as Neanderthal-human hybrids, enter thesettlement. Perhaps they wear long, hooded garments made of linen, flax, orhide, as well as belts decorated with strange symbols, leather leggings, andboots made out of animal skin (a reconstruction by graphic artist Russell M.Hossain is offered in figure 26.1). They are clearly hunters, with bows andarrows slung over their backs and items of personal adornment gained from thechase. They have necklaces of wolf or fox teeth; strings of beads made fromivory, bone, shell, antler, and stone; as well as insignia of office that hanglike medallions around their necks. Alongside them are others, peoples of theregion, identified as post-Zarzian shamans, warriors, and tradesmen.[images/00092.jpg]Figure 26.1. 3-D digital sculpts by artist Russell M. Hossain depicting theHooded Ones—the Swiderian power elite behind the creation of Göbekli Tepe. Theirphysical traits are derived from anatomical evidence of the Brünn population andthe Sungir burials of Russia, coupled with a knowledge of Swiderian physiognomy,which suggests Neanderthal-human hybridization.Leaders of the group will have addressed representatives of the community,showing them examples of exotic materials such as obsidian from Bingöl and LakeVan and flint from farther afield. They might have offered to supply these andother valuable commodities, and then, after gaining the community’s trust, thehooded strangers will have revealed the true purpose of their mission. Their skymagic had successfully combated the baleful influences of the canine trickster,who had attempted to destroy the world at the time of the great fire from thesky. This knowledge they would now pass on at a price. However, to successfullybind the cosmic trickster and ensure the future stability of the sky pole thatsupported the heavens, the community would have to give up their huntinglifestyles and learn to work together to put into practice this powerful magic.COMMUNITY NETWORKINGThe chances are that this incoming group, of Swiderian descent, visited otherEpipaleolithic communities as well, offering exotic materials to theirinhabitants while at the same time spreading their potent message and showingtheir control and influence over the cosmic trickster, perhaps by predicting theappearance of short-period comets. Eventually the Hooded Ones gained control ofeach and every one of the settlements they entered. When simple exchanges didnot work, open conflict might have ensued, although very likely the strangersset existing allies against confrontational groups or tribes to quell anyunrest.This then was very likely the beginning of a type of regional supremacyinstigated by the incoming power elite to bring about the building projects thatwould eventually lead to the creation of major cult centers such as GöbekliTepe. These stone sanctuaries would function as axes mundi, terrestrial turningpoints of the heavens, their central pillars acting as gateways or portals to aperceived sky world existing in the direction of the constellation of Cygnus.From these enclosures rites of birth, death, and rebirth would be enacted andthe baleful influence of comets countered by shamans.THE WALLS OF JERICHOHow exactly the ruling elite might have convinced the indigenous peoples tocreate monumental architecture on such a grand scale remains a mystery. Fear isthe most obvious answer—fear that it would all happen again if they did notcreate these monuments in exactly the fashion prescribed. Yet as Klaus Schmidtis at pains to point out, nothing like Göbekli Tepe existed anywhere else in theworld at this time. That said, monumental architecture was being builtcontemporary to the construction of Göbekli Tepe 420 miles (675 kilometers) awayat Jericho, in what is today the Palestinian territories.A Natufian site existed at Jericho during the Younger Dryas period, but it wasnot until the arrival of a Pre-Pottery Neolithic A culture that the place wastransformed into a major town complex. Very quickly the inhabitants felt theneed to surround the 10-acre (4 hectare) settlement with a stone wall 10 feet (3meters) thick and 13 feet (4 meters) high, which extended around the entireoccupational mound for a distance of nearly half a mile (800 meters).In addition to the great wall, the Jericho inhabitants constructed an enormousstone tower 33 feet (10 meters) in diameter and 28 feet (8.5 meters) high,accessed through a west-facing doorway that connected with a stone staircase oftwenty-two steps.As well as the almighty stone tower and perimeter wall, a gigantic ditch was cutout of the limestone bedrock around the outside of the settlement. This was 9feet deep (2.75 meters), 27 feet wide (8 meters), and more than half a mile(over 800 meters) long, with one prehistorian describing it, aptly, as “aconsiderable feat in the absence of metal tools.”1[index_split_058.html#filepos985537]Clearly, something major was occurring at Jericho. The inhabitants seemed eagerto keep something out, and it was not simply wild animals or the elements. Anaggressor lurked out there somewhere, who was perceived as a potential threat tothe well-being and lifestyle of the Jericho population, which numbered in thehundreds.The existence of sites such as Jericho tells us that the capability to supersizemonuments and structures was present among the Pre-Pottery Neolithic peoples ofthe Fertile Crescent at this time. Yet clearly, before the construction ofGöbekli Tepe and Jericho, the motivation to create large-scale stone buildingsfor specific magico-religious purposes was simply not present. Something thenchanged, and all the indications are that the hunter-gatherers of southeastAnatolia and the Levantine corridor were responding to events happening in theirworld, and in the opinion of the author that was the Younger Dryas Boundaryimpact event and the incredible state of fear it left in the world’s humanpopulation in its aftermath. However, even then it had taken the intrusion of apowerful elite of European descent to inspire the creation of monumentalarchitecture with the intent of curbing wide-scale catastrophobia once and forall.SCHMIDT AND THE SWIDERIANSAs controversial as these theories might seem, even Klaus Schmidt has had hiseye on the Swiderians as being in some way instrumental in what was going on insoutheast Anatolia at the commencement of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic age. Notonly does he acknowledge the similarity between the Natufian gazelle hunters andthe “reindeer hunters of the North,”2 [index_split_058.html#filepos985723] thatis, those in Europe, and admit that “perhaps there was some kind of connectionor communication between the societies of Turkey and those around the Black Seaand the Crimea,”3 [index_split_058.html#filepos985874] but in a paper writtenfor the journal Neo-lithics in 2002, he even names the Swiderians4[index_split_058.html#filepos985974] when he writes:> The late Paleolithic Swiderian reindeer hunters of eastern Europe had a> similar hunting strategy [to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic peoples of the Upper> Euphrates] using the seasonal wandering of reindeer and their crossing of big> rivers such as the Vistula (Weichsel).5 [index_split_058.html#filepos986145]Schmidt obviously recognizes something of the European hunting tradition in thePre-Pottery Neolithic world that existed in the lead-up to the construction ofGöbekli Tepe and other religious centers in southeast Anatolia during the tenthmillennium BC. He singles out the Swiderians as an example of these huntingstrategies, when he could have mentioned the Hamburgian-Ahrenburgian cultures ofNorth Germany, the Brommian-Lyngby cultures of Denmark and Scandinavia, orindeed any one of a number of other Paleolithic hunting traditions that thrivedin Europe toward the end of the Upper Paleolithic age. Why? Was it that he hadjust read an article on the Swiderian culture and wanted simply to use them asan example of this hunting strategy, or does he too have a sense of theirpresence at Göbekli Tepe?The greatest clue is in the German archaeologist’s suggestion that “perhapsthere was some kind of connection or communication between the societies ofTurkey and those around the Black Sea and the Crimea.”6[index_split_058.html#filepos986250] When he said these words toosteoarchaeologist and TV presenter Dr. Alice Roberts, he almost certainly hadin mind the incursions of the Polish Swiderian tradition into the CrimeanHighlands, immediately above the Black Sea. A simple boat journey along itseastern coast, or a gradual migration overland through the Caucasus Mountainsand the Armenian Highlands, would have brought these European hunters directlyinto contact with the Epipaleolithic peoples of southeast Anatolia, and Schmidtknows this very well. However, I suspect that until now he has found nothingconcrete at Göbekli Tepe that might help confirm these surmises, despite thefact that worked flints have been found that are more-orless identical toSwiderian tanged points.THE END OF GÖBEKLI TEPEThe world of Göbekli Tepe remains truly bizarre, and so far we have only beenable to scratch the surface of what was really going on here nearly twelvethousand years ago. Having started with grand structures featuring monoliths 18feet (5.5 meters) high, the Göbekli builders ended up settling for bathroom-sizerooms, with standing stones no more than a few feet in height and communalbenches like something you might find in a family-size Jacuzzi.It seems clear that whatever incentive there had been to remain loyal to aparticular style and design gradually diminished as the centuries rolled by. Itis almost as if the Göbekli builders, although still committed to following anestablished tradition, which included the erection of anthropomorphic T-shapedpillars, were now downsizing in their choice of architectural styles. By the endthey were simply going through the motions, without the original motivationbeing there any more.It has been suggested that the entire complex at Göbekli Tepe was buriedhurriedly around 8000 BC, as if there was some urgency involved. It has evenbeen speculated that the large enclosures were covered over to protect them fromanother cataclysm, either a comet strike or some kind of plasma-induced event,brought about by a coronal mass ejection from the sun.7[index_split_058.html#filepos986350]As attractive as such disaster scenarios might seem, there is at present nothingthat has been discovered at Göbekli Tepe that might support such claims. Thesite’s final decommissioning involved the remaining sanctuaries, cult buildings,shrines, and other structures being buried beneath thousands of tons of importedearth, quarry chippings, and refuse matter. Yet even then, very occasionally,the heads of stones would be exposed by soil erosion and tilling of the land.The rest, however, remained encased within the tell’s swollen belly for a fullten thousand years until Klaus Schmidt realized the site’s incredible importancein 1994. We owe him a great debt for bringing back to life this unimaginablestone complex that reveals to us the mind-set of our ancestors during an age ofuncertainty and change.Yet we cannot end the story here, for even after the final abandonment ofGöbekli Tepe its legacy lived on, and there is every reason to believe that therole its founders, and maintainers, played in the instigation of the Neolithicrevolution was preserved in the myths and legends of the cultures that thrivedin these same regions during much later times.Some of these ancient accounts are still with us today, and it is time now tosee how exactly they address the strange world that existed in southeastAnatolia and the Armenian Highlands during the formative years of the Neolithicera. As we shall see, they seem to preserve dim echoes of the Younger DryasBoundary impact event and the existence of the Hooded Ones—the Swiderian elitewhose memory is encapsulated in the rings of T-shaped pillars and twin centralmonoliths at Göbekli Tepe.For the next part of our journey the author would like to ask the reader toexcuse him as he now switches from a third-person narrative to, where necessary,a first-person delivery that much better fits the quest of discovery that befellhim in the wake of an extraordinary sequence of events that will culminate withthe finding of Eden itself."},{"pageContent":"PART FIVEConvergence[images/00125.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"27IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN > The overwhelming aroma of incense hung heavy in the air of the church’s> darkened interior.

I had already submitted a detailed synopsis and chapterbreakdown and knew pretty well what I was going to write.Yet now I sensed that something was missing, a major piece of the jigsaw that myvivid dream suggested I would find if I looked in the right places. Somewhere ineastern Turkey, not far from the huge inland sea named Lake Van, a couple ofhundred miles east of Göbekli Tepe, was, I felt, a church and monastery wherethe monks believed that the landscape thereabouts was the actual Garden of Eden.These were thoughts now going through my mind, even though twenty years ofresearch into the origins of the Genesis account of the Fall and itsgeographical relationship to eastern Turkey, for books such as From the Ashes ofAngels (1996) and Gods of Eden (1998), had failed to uncover anything evenremotely like this tradition.TEMPLE IN EDENThere seemed only one thing to do, and this was for me to reexamine the evidencethat had led me to conclude that eastern Turkey, the former Greater Armenia, orArmenia Major, was the true site of the Garden of Eden, and to see if I couldturn up any new leads that might throw further light on this puzzling mystery.This seemed especially important to do, as in 2009 there had been reports thatProfessor Klaus Schmidt had told British journalist Sean Thomas (writing underthe pseudonym Tom Knox) that “Göbekli Tepe was not the Garden of Eden: it is atemple in Eden.”1 [index_split_058.html#filepos986572]Although Klaus Schmidt told me in September 2012 that Sean Thomas had misquotedhim (the German archaeologist had actually said that Göbekli Tepe was anEden-like place, not “a temple in Eden”), the story became a news sensation,with headlines such as “Do These Mysterious Stones Mark the Site of the Gardenof Eden?”2 [index_split_058.html#filepos987058] appearing worldwide. The Germanarchaeologist obviously played down the matter, and eventually it did all diedown. (I actually apologized to Schmidt as it was me who’d given Sean Thomasinstructions on how to get out there, after he became interested in Göbekli Tepethrough reading material I’d written on the subject.)So if Göbekli Tepe was not the Garden of Eden, where was it really located, andhow did the Genesis story of Adam and Eve and the Fall fit into the emergence ofthe Pre-Pottery Neolithic world of southeast Anatolia?THE EXISTENCE OF PARADISEIt was really not until medieval times that people started looking for theGarden of Eden. Prior to this time it was considered a paradisiacal realmcreated by God for the benefit of our First Parents, Adam and Eve, who had livedin a state of perpetual bliss and happiness, not knowing death, pain, or hunger.Yet when they committed the original sin by eating of the Tree of Knowledge ofGood and Evil, and knew immediately that they were naked, God removed Paradisefrom the reach not only of our First Parents, but also of humanity as a whole.Never again would humans gaze upon the garden until the Final Judgment, when allrighteous souls would be reunited with God in the heavenly Paradise. In otherwords, there was no point looking for Eden as it had no material presence in themundane world. In fact, so detached from the physical world was it considered tobe that some medieval theologians and church leaders thought that God hadremoved it to the vicinity of the Moon.3 [index_split_058.html#filepos987158]Even if Paradise had existed in a material sense, there was no way it wasaccessible to humankind. It existed as a place beyond physical existence, almostlike a parallel world, guarded by angels called cherubim, whose flaming swordsprotected its entrances with an impenetrable wall of fire. This was the mannerin which Paradise was portrayed on medieval maps of the world—as a walled gardensurrounded by fire, existing just beyond the eastern limits of the Eurasianlandmass. Adam and Eve, the Serpent of Temptation, the Tree of Good and Evil,and the cherubim with flaming swords would all be present, as if to remind theonlooker where humanity might now be if the original sin had not been committed.Those church leaders or theologians who did propose that the Garden of Edenmight once have had a physical existence would be informed that if this were thecase, then it would have been destroyed in the Great Flood. According to theGenesis account, this all-encompassing deluge engulfed the entire earth, rightto the highest mountaintops. Only Noah and his family survived by taking to theark and eventually finding the sole piece of land that God had set aside toremain above water, and it was from here that the world began anew.THE GREAT REFORMThese were the generally accepted views that the Church of Rome held regardingthe existence of Paradise, and very few scholars or church leaders daredchallenge these opinions for fear of being branded as heretics. It was not untilthe religious reforms of the sixteenth century and the birth of Lutheranism andProtestantism that attitudes began to change regarding the concept of Paradise.This was helped by the discovery of the American continent, which confirmed thatthe known world was not surrounded by an expanse of water, beyond which therewas nothing, a realization that led eventually to the abandonment of thelong-held belief that the world was flat. The earth was a globe, and every partof it could be mapped and explored without fear of falling off into an abyssthat existed beyond God’s creation. So everything in the world became moretangible and fixed, and even the inspired word of God transmitted through theprophet Moses to create the Pentateuch, the first five books of the OldTestament, became subject to question for the first time.Church leaders, travelers, and cartographers began now to find firm geographicalclues in the Bible that revealed the true location of the Garden of Eden, whichmany now concluded had existed in the Bible lands themselves. According to thebook of Genesis, as well as various apocryphal and pseudepigraphical works ofJewish, Christian, and Muslim origin, the Garden of Eden was watered by a singlestream that took its rise from a spring or fountain that emerged from the baseof the Tree of Life. After exiting the garden, the stream then split into fourheads that became the sources of four great rivers (see figure 27.1), each ofwhich are named and described in chapter two of the book of Genesis (I shallquote from Young’s Literal Translation of the Bible, which exactly reproducesthe original Jewish and Greek text, so that nothing is lost in translation):> And a river is going out from Eden to water the garden, and from thence it is> parted, and hath become four chief [rivers]; the name of the one [is] Pison,> it [is] that which is surrounding the whole land of the Havilah where the gold> [is], and the gold of that land [is] good, there [in Havilah, is] the bdolach> and the shoham stone; and the name of the second river [is] Gibon [or Gihon],> it [is] that which is surrounding the whole land of Cush; and the name of the> third river [is] Hiddekel, it [is] that which is going east of Asshur; and the> fourth river is Phrat. (Gen. 2:10–14)4 [index_split_058.html#filepos987392][images/00104.jpg]Figure 27.1. Adam and Eve in the terrestrial Paradise, from the Hereford Mappamundi (Map of the World), ca. 1300 AD . Note the four rivers of Paradise, eachone named, which emerge from a fountain of four heads positioned in front of theTree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, complete with the Serpent of Temptation.Identifying these four rivers has always been key to locating the terrestrialParadise, and two of them are easily found. The last one mentioned, the Phrat(Kurdish Firat, Armenian Aratsani, Greek and Roman Arsanias), is the Euphrates,the longest river in Western Asia. It has two main branches, the Kara Şu, orWestern Euphrates, and the Murad Şu, or Eastern Euphrates, which rise,respectively, to the north and northwest of Lake Van in the Armenian Highlands.They then snake their way through southeast Turkey and merge together beforepassing into northern Syria and entering the Mesopotamia Plain in what is todayIraq. Just before emptying into the Persian Gulf, the Euphrates joins the TigrisRiver.There can be little question that the Euphrates was one of the four rivers ofParadise, and this information alone should always have been enough to establishthe geographical position of Eden as being somewhere along its course. Yet wefind again and again that this was often not the case, with the Garden of Edenbeing placed not just in the Bible lands but also in every other part of theancient and new world. Ceylon, the Americas, equatorial Africa, Australia, andeven the North Pole have all been proposed as the setting for the terrestrialParadise, based on arguments that seem more related to personal theories and thebeauty of the place than to the facts presented in the Genesis account.THE HIDDEKELAnother river of Paradise easy to identify is the Hiddekel, which flows to the“east of Asshur”; that is, Assyria, in what is today northern Iraq. This isunquestionably the River Tigris (from the Persian tigra, meaning “arrow”),originally called the Hiddekel (from the Akkadian id Idikla, “the river ofIdikla”), which does indeed flow through the eastern parts of the ancientkingdom of Assyria. The river, which takes its rise northeast of the city ofDiyarbakır, immediately south of the main sources of the Euphrates, is fed by aseries of tributaries that rise in the Eastern Taurus Mountains of easternTurkey.The Tigris then leaves Turkey and flows southeastward through Iraq, parallelwith the Euphrates on its western side. The two rivers bend toward each other inthe vicinity of Baghdad, close to the site of the ancient city of Babylon. Yetinstead of coming together they run parallel for a few miles before partingagain, only to merge finally into one giant estuary that empties into thePersian Gulf.So if both the Euphrates and the Tigris form two of the four rivers of Paradise,this should confirm that the Garden of Eden was either where they take theirrise in the Eastern Taurus Mountains and Armenian Highlands or where they cometogether in southern Iraq; no other possible location should even be consideredbased on the evidence provided by the book of Genesis. Indeed, the matter can bepinned down still further by pointing out that the Garden of Eden was situatedat the source of the four rivers, meaning that the terrestrial Paradise can onlyhave been located in historical Armenia, modern eastern Turkey. Where exactly isprovided by the identities of the remaining two rivers.GIHON AND THE LAND OF CUSHIdentifying the Gibon or, more commonly, the Gihon, another of the rivers ofParadise, is slightly more of a challenge, although the fact that it is said toflow “around the whole land of Cush” is a major clue. Usually, the land of Cushis identified with an ancient kingdom of this name in Ethiopia, the reason theword Ethiopia appears instead of Cush in the King James Bible. It is also whythe Gihon is identified with the River Nile, which rises in Ethiopia and wascalled the Geion by the Coptic Christians of Egypt.5[index_split_058.html#filepos987567]Yet these identifications are fundamentally wrong, and very misleading too.Cush, or Kush, is more likely to be a kingdom named in Assyrian inscriptions asKusu. It was the land of a people called the Kusai, who lived “in the celebratedhill country to the north of Syria, whence came the Kusai breed of horses.”6[index_split_058.html#filepos987686] Indeed, it was apparently from Kusu thatthe Assyrians obtained their horses.7 [index_split_058.html#filepos987825]English Assyriologist George Smith (1840–1876), in The Chaldean Account ofGenesis (1876), notes that in the book of Genesis the father of Nimrod, thebuilder of the Tower of Babel, is given as Cush, and that this too might be anallusion to the land of Kusu.8 [index_split_058.html#filepos988085] Nimrod is alegendary figure of Armenian folk history said to have cast the patriarchAbraham into a fiery furnace because he would not bow down to pagan idols. Thisis supposed to have taken place in the ancient city of Edessa, modern Şanlıurfa,celebrated as the birthplace of Abraham. It is also, as we have seen, just 8miles (13 kilometers) away from Göbekli Tepe, a connection that should not beforgotten. If Kusu was north of Assyria, then it must have been locatedsomewhere in the vicinity of Lake Van and the Armenian Highlands.Historical Armenia was overrun by the Turkish Ottoman Empire in themid-fifteenth century, and although it kept its cultural, religious, andgeographical identity until the twentieth century, the entire country was wipedoff the face of the map following the Armenian Genocide of 1915. In antiquity,however, it was a kingdom in its own right, with the separate kingdom of ArmeniaMinor to its west. Today the modern Republic of Armenia, the former SovietArmenia, is the only remaining part of Greater Armenia (or Armenia Major), withthe rest of “historical Armenia” now being simply the eastern provinces ofTurkey.Back in the first millennium BC, at the height of the Assyrian Empire, thekingdom of Armenia was famous for its horses. The Greek geographer Straboreported that it was very good for “horse pasturing” and that “Nesaean horses,”favored by the Persian kings, were bred there.9[index_split_058.html#filepos988231] Moreover, Strabo recorded that every yearthe Persian king was sent by way of a tribute from Armenia twenty thousandfoals.10 [index_split_058.html#filepos988373] He noted also that: “The passionfor riding and the care of horses characterize the Thessalians, and are commonto Armenians and Medes.”11 [index_split_058.html#filepos988497] The Medes werethe inhabitants of Media, a kingdom located on the southern shores of theCaspian Sea, northeast of Armenia, in what is today Azerbaijan and northwestIran.So the land of Kusu, where Kusai horses came from, was almost certainly areference to the Armenian Highlands, which makes sense, for the Gihon River haslong been identified with the Araxes (the modern Aras) River. Along with a majorbranch of the Western Euphrates, the Araxes takes its rise on Bingöl Mountain,the center of the obsidian trade, located some 30 miles (48 kilometers) south ofthe city of Erzurum. It then flows eastward, past the base of Mount Ararat,joining eventually another great river called the Kur before emptying finallyinto the Caspian Sea. Its mouth is near Baku, the capital and largest city ofAzerbaijan, ancient Media, close to Gobustan, the site of the incredible rockart described in chapter 23.Where exactly the name Gihon came from is unclear, although during the Arabinvasion of the Caucasus in the eighth century the river was known as theGaihun,12 [index_split_058.html#filepos988622] with nineteenth-century Persiandictionaries referring to the Araxes as the Jichon-Aras.13[index_split_058.html#filepos988742] Moreover, American theologian andeducationist John McClintock (1814–1870) recorded in his multivolume biblicalencyclopedia that the Gihon “to this day bears the same name among the Arabs.This [i.e., the Araxes] is a large river in Armenia Major, which takes its risefrom a number of sources in Mount Abus (the present Bin-Gol), nearly in thecentre of the space between the east and west branches of the Euphrates.”14[index_split_058.html#filepos988874]Strangely, not only was the Araxes identified with the Gihon by Dutchphilologist and scholar Hadrian Reland (1676–1718) more than three hundred yearsago, but he also proposed that the land of Cush, through which it passed, was“the country of the Cussaei of the ancients,”15[index_split_058.html#filepos989086] a perceptive observation that is almostcertainly correct.So from the evidence provided so far we can be pretty certain that if onespecific location is being identified as the site of the terrestrial Paradisethen it is the Armenian Highlands, where the Euphrates and Araxes take theirrise, with the source of the Tigris just a short distance to the south.IN SEARCH OF THE PISONThe final river of Paradise, called the Pison, or Pishon, is a little moretricky to identify, so the clues offered by the book of Genesis are worthexamining a second time: “the name of the one [is] Pison, it [is] that which issurrounding the whole land of the Havilah where the gold [is], and the gold ofthat land [is] good, there [is] the bdolach and the shoham stone.”To begin with, the land of Havilah is completely unknown, although Havilah as apersonal name also appears in the book of Genesis, where it is cited, likeNimrod, as being a son of Cush (Gen. 10:9). If these names are, as seemspossible, references both to kingdoms and their founders, then the fact thatCush is synonymous with the land of Kusu, an ancient name for Armenia, suggeststhat this is where we should look for the Pison River.THE LAND OF GOLDAdding weight to this conclusion is the fact that Armenia was well known for itsgold, as is recorded by Strabo, who in the section of his Geography on Armeniaspeaks of the gold mines of “Syspiritis and Caballa, to where Menon was sent byAlexander with soldiers, and he was led up to them by the natives.”16[index_split_058.html#filepos989221]Dutch chemist and science historian RobertJames Forbes proposed that the mines of “Syspiritis and Caballa” were on theBlack Sea near Batumi in southwest Georgia, the site of Colchis, legendary landof the Golden Fleece.17 [index_split_058.html#filepos989364]It is an interesting theory. However, the site of Caballa is completely lost tous. Syspiritis, on the other hand, is a little more easy to track down, foralthough some classical scholars like to see its gold mines as existingsomewhere in the vicinity of the ancient city of Erzurum, north of BingölMountain, Syspiritis was most likely close to Adiabenê.18[index_split_058.html#filepos989504] This is a former kingdom and Assyrian city(the modern Arbil, or Erbil) located between the Upper Zab and Lower Zab riversof northern Iraq, which flow down from the direction of the Thospites, or ArseneLake,19 [index_split_058.html#filepos989648] ancient names for Lake Van, andmerge eventually with the Tigris River. Interesting in this respect is the factthat Robert Forbes mentions that “other deposits [of gold] known are south ofLake Van,”20 [index_split_058.html#filepos989804] doubly confirming thatSyspiritis is to be looked for here, and not farther north.21[index_split_058.html#filepos989905]SEAT ON THE RIVER OF EDENThis information becomes a major clue to the identity of the last river ofParadise, for the ancient Assyrian Church, also known as the Nestorian Church,recognized the Greater Zab as the River Pison. This information comes from theseat of their patriarch and head bishop, or Catholicos, located from theseventeenth century until the Assyrian Genocide of 1915 at Kotchanes (modernKonak) in the Hakkari. This is a remote region in the foothills of the ZagrosMountains in the southeast corner of Turkey, close to the borders with Iraq andIran. Here the patriarch would sign off his letters “from my cell on the Riverof the Garden of Eden.”22 [index_split_058.html#filepos990006]Valuable clues like this should not be taken lightly, as the Assyrian Church wasone of the oldest forms of Christianity existing in the region, being founded asearly as the first century.23 [index_split_058.html#filepos990212] This seems toaffirm that the land of Havilah, through which the Pison flowed, was an areadefined by the course of the Greater Zab, which embraces the Turkish provincesof Van and Hakkari, as well as the Iraqi governorate of Arbil.The “bdolach” that we are told was found in the land of Havilah can easily beidentified as a resinous exudation produced by shrubs of the Astragalus genus,called gum tragacanth or astragalus manna.24[index_split_058.html#filepos990538] This was collected in the Mush, Erzurum,and Lake Van districts of Greater Armenia25 [index_split_058.html#filepos990669]and then transported to the city of Mosul, close to where the Greater Zab joinsthe Tigris.26 [index_split_058.html#filepos990821] However, the province mostcommonly associated with the Astragalus shrub is the Hakkari,27[index_split_058.html#filepos990966] the suspected heartland of the land ofHavilah.As for the shoham stone mentioned in the Genesis account, this is probably areference either to onyx (its usual identity), which is found in the Araratdistrict of Armenia, or to obsidian, which was very often confused with onyx inancient times. Having made all these statements, there is one further traditionregarding the identity of the Pison that, due to its compelling yet conflictingimplications, is best left until chapter 29.RELAND’S CHOICEThe Genesis account of the Garden of Eden indicates, very clearly, that if itdid exist as a physical location, then it was to be found somewhere in thevicinity of Lake Van and the Armenian Highlands, where the sources of the fourrivers of Paradise take their course (see figure 27.2). It is a conclusion thatanyone can achieve, simply by following the clues on offer, and it was somethingthat Dutch scholar Hadrian Reland worked out at the beginning of the eighteenthcentury.28 [index_split_058.html#filepos991457] However, having identified theEuphrates, Tigris, and Araxes as three of the rivers of Paradise, he chose tocorrelate the final one, the Pison, with the Phasis, a river mentioned inancient Greek sources, which is usually associated with the Rion, or Rioni,which rises in Georgia and empties into the Black Sea.[images/00115.jpg]Figure 27.2. Map of southwest Asia showing the most likely candidates for thefour rivers of Paradise: the Euphrates (Phrat), Tigris (Hiddekel), Araxes(Gihon), and Greater Zab (Pison). The modern trend in identifying the Pison withthe Uizhun River of Iran is rife with problems due to its great distance fromthe sources of the other three rivers.Choosing the Phasis as the Pison pulls the imaginary epicenter for theterrestrial Paradise much farther north, toward the northern extremes of theArmenian Highlands, whereas identifying the Pison with the Greater Zab placesthe epicenter much farther south, close to the northern edge of the plain ofMush, which separates the Armenian Highlands from the Eastern Taurus Mountainsto the south (see figure 27.3).[images/00124.jpg]Figure 27.3. Map showing sources of the four rivers of Paradise with theirepicenter in the vicinity of the Mush Plain in eastern Turkey. Note thelocations of the land of Cush, through which the Gihon flowed, and the land ofHavilah, associated with the Pison River. Note also the Peri S̨u, or Gail(“Wolf”) River, which in Armenian tradition is identified with the Pison (seechapter 29).Was this where I would find the Armenian monastery where, according to my dream,the monks believed they served God in the Garden of Eden itself? As we shall seenext, the Mush Plain becomes one of the most likely candidates for the site ofthe terrestrial Paradise, information that, although available long ago, has notstopped theologians and scholars from locating Eden everywhere but where thefour rivers of Paradise take their rise."},{"pageContent":"28THE FOUNTAIN OF PARADISEThe book of Genesis’s description of the four rivers of Paradise indicates verystrongly that the Garden of Eden was located in historical Armenia, modern-dayeastern Turkey, with the epicenter being somewhere in the vicinity of theenigmatic plain of Mush, a vast expanse of congealed lava, created across tensof thousands of years by the outpouring of the various volcanoes that surroundit. After crumbling to dust, the lava was transformed into a rich soil that hasmade Mush one of the most fertile regions in eastern Turkey, noted in the pastfor its wheat and tobacco. Vineyards were also once numerous, with a fair wineapparently being produced.1 [index_split_058.html#filepos991675]THE PLAIN OF MUSHThe plain itself lies at a height of just over 4,100 feet (1,250 meters) abovesea level and is approximately 40 miles (64 kilometers) in length from east towest and 10 miles (16 kilometers) broad. Visible at its eastern end is theextinct volcano Nemrut Dağ (Mount Nimrod), which takes the form of a giganticcaldera half a mile (800 meters) in diameter, within which is an enormouscrescent-shaped lake. Obsidian from Nemrut Dağ has been found at Göbekli Tepe.The Murad Şu, or Eastern Euphrates, cuts right across the plain, dividing it intwo, before vanishing into a narrow gorge at its western end. This creates apass through the Eastern Taurus Mountains, along which the somewhat hazardousroad to Diyarbakır winds its way. This was the old obsidian route from Bingöland Lake Van to the various proto-Neolithic and Pre-Pottery Neolithic centers,such as Hallan Çemi, Çayönü, Nevalı Çori, and, of course, Göbekli Tepe.Another gorge at the plain’s southeast corner forms a pass through the EasternTaurus range, providing access to the university city of Bitlis (ancientBaghesh) and Lake Van while another pass, carved out by the Murad Şu, opens theway north toward Bingöl, both the town and the mountain, beyond which is the oldArmenian city of Karin, modern-day Erzurum.MONASTIC FOUNDATIONSSome miles to the northwest of the town of Mush, the capital of the province ofthe same name, are the remains of Surb Karapet, or more correctly Surb HovhannesKarapet Vank, the Monastery of Saint John the Baptist. Before its destruction atthe time of the Armenian Genocide in 1915, it was a major place of pilgrimage,with Christians coming here from all over Armenia to venerate holy relicsbelonging to John the Baptist. According to tradition, Armenia’s great crusadingchurchman Gregory the Illuminator built the monastery on the site of importantpagan temples destroyed by him and his army at the beginning of the fourthcentury. Today, Surb Karapet, which from old pictures looks more like afairy-tale castle than a monastery, is little more than a few pathetic walls inthe middle of a bustling Kurdish village, which has long since lost interest inits rich Armenian heritage.Apparently, several monasteries were once to be found on the plain of Mush,which formed part of a royal kingdom called Taron, or Turuberan, where ArmenianChristianity had its beginnings even before the arrival of Gregory theIlluminator in the fourth century.2 [index_split_058.html#filepos991825] I couldfind information about just one other notable monastic ruin in the area, andthis was Surb Arakelots (Holy Apostles), located in a mountain valley southeastof the town of Mush. However, an examination of what was known about SurbKarapet and Surb Arakelots, or, indeed, any of the other monasteries that onceexisted in the region, did not in any way feel similar to what I had seen andexperienced in my dream.THE TREE OF LIFEYet the more I recalled the strange ceremony taking place inside the gloomychurch interior, the more I became convinced not only that the Eden monasteryexisted, but that the monks there had been elevating an object of greatspiritual value. It had been removed from a plain, wooden box that acted as areliquary (a relic holder). As to the nature of the relic, this seemed to be ablackened piece of wood, like a short, round section of a tree branch, some 2.5inches (6 centimeters) in diameter and 7 to 8 inches (18 to 20 centimeters) inlength.Initially, I thought the monks might have identified this relic as a piece ofthe Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, which the Genesis account tells us wasto be found in the Garden of Eden. However, this did not sit right with me, andvery quickly I realized that I had this wrong. The relic was in fact thought tobe a fragment of the Tree of Life, the other tree in the Garden of Eden. Thatfelt absolutely right, especially as I had seen it being elevated during aritual that seemed to celebrate life itself.The monks, I suspected, believed that simply possessing this holy relic invokeda sense of the eternal life that Adam and Eve experienced before their expulsionfrom the Garden of Eden. The couple’s existence was sustained through theirproximity to the Tree of Life, which, situated within the garden, was seen as apowerhouse of divine energy that transcended the normal laws of nature. Yetwithout the benefits of the Tree of Life, Adam and Eve, along with all theirdescendants, were doomed to suffer mortality in all its ugly ways, a justpunishment for committing the original sin, or so the book of Genesis tells us.That the monks of the monastery drew some kind of spiritual power from what theysaw as a fragment of the Tree of Life made absolute sense. Combining thereligious potency of this relic with the fact that the monastery was thought tohave existed in the Garden of Eden would only have increased their faith in whatthey believed they were achieving here in this spiritual powerhouse. No wonder Icould so vividly recall this archaic ritual that must have taken place beforethe assumed destruction of the monastery at the time of the Armenian Genocide.I sensed strongly that the monastery in question existed somewhere in thevicinity of the plain of Mush. It was a perfect setting for the Garden of Eden,especially as high mountains surround it on all sides and from these comestreams that feed all four rivers of Paradise.FINDING OTHER EDENSDespite this information, the most often quoted solution regarding thewhereabouts of the Garden of Eden stems from the somewhat puzzling conclusion,first proposed by influential French theologian and pastor John Calvin(1509–1564), that the terrestrial Paradise was located in the vicinity ofBasrah, in southern Iraq. Here the Euphrates and Tigris rivers were once thoughtto have come together and then parted again to form all four rivers of Paradise.The fact of the matter is that although these two great rivers do indeedconverge here to form the Shatt al-Arab waterway, into which flows Iran’s KarunRiver (which some take to be the Gihon3 [index_split_058.html#filepos991990]),this hardly fits the evidence offered for the location of the Garden of Eden inthe book of Genesis.Others have suggested that the four “heads” of the rivers of Paradise refer totheir mouths, meaning that we should be looking for the Garden of Eden where theEuphrates and Tigris empty into the Persian Gulf. This has prompted all sorts ofcomplicated theories involving now-vanished rivers, with the most persuasivebeing that the Pison once ran through Arabia’s Wadi al-Rummah, emptying into thePersian Gulf close to the Shatt al-Arab waterway.4[index_split_058.html#filepos992134] As far-fetched as these claims might seem,they remain the most popular theories regarding the true site of the Garden ofEden.5 [index_split_058.html#filepos992234]More incredible still is the view that the holy city of Jerusalem is theterrestrial Paradise, based on a few brief references in the Old Testamentcomparing the city to the Garden of Eden, along with a Jewish legend that speaksof Jerusalem as the center of the world.6 [index_split_058.html#filepos992527]Once again, this is not simply the belief of lay people, but the opinion oftheologians and historians, even though Jerusalem is located nowhere near any ofthe easily identifiable rivers of Paradise.These theories have been put forth despite the fact that Armenian scholars havefor many years attempted to convince the outside world that the terrestrialParadise was located in their historical homeland. Their arguments go unnoticedbecause they are usually written in Russian Armenian, which very fewnon-Armenians can read. Even when their work is published in English, somethingis lost in translation, resulting in very few people taking it seriously.7[index_split_058.html#filepos992971]THE REVEREND MARMADUKE CARVERYet, as we have seen, Westerners do occasionally conclude that the area aroundthe sources of the four rivers of Paradise constitutes the most likely site ofthe Garden of Eden. Dutch scholar Hadrian Reland worked this out at thebeginning of the eighteenth century, although he was certainly not the first todo so. One of the earliest individuals to come to the same conclusion was therather grandly named Marmaduke Carver (d. 1665), a former rector of Harthill inSouth Yorkshire. His fascinating work on the subject, entitled A Discourse ofthe Terrestrial Paradise, Aiming at a More Probable Discovery of the TrueSituation of That Happy Place of Our First Parents Habitation, was publishedposthumously in 1666, one year after his death.Having learned that the Reverend Marmaduke Carver had identified the site of theGarden of Eden as Armenia Major, I decided to find out more about thechurchman’s life and theories, so went in search of him and his book, beginningwith his former parish of Harthill, near Sheffield. Yet here, in the localparish church, I found no mention of him, other than his name entered in a longlist of rectors from medieval times to the present day.One thing I did manage to establish was that toward the end of his life Carverhad spent much of his time in the city of York, just 60 miles (97 kilometers)from Harthill. Here he had become chaplain to Sir Thomas Osborne (afterward Dukeof Leeds), high sheriff of the county, delivering sermons in York Minster, thecity’s famous cathedral. More significantly, I found that on his death in August1665 Carver’s body had been laid to rest in the south aisle of the cathedralchoir.So after leaving Harthill, I traveled to York Minster, hoping to find someevidence of Carver’s gravesite. Yet no evidence of his interment remains today,not even the wall plaque that marked the spot. This was obviously a greatdisappointment, so after sitting down briefly in the choir area to meditate onwhat I should do next, I made the decision to visit the York Minster Library,located within the cathedral grounds. Here I was finally able to find out alittle more about the fate of Marmaduke Carver’s memorial plaque. Originally ithad borne an inscription in Latin, written by James Torre, an early historian ofthe minster, but this had been destroyed during restoration work in 1736. It wassubsequently replaced with a new plaque, its inscription now in English. This,however, along with the site of Carver’s grave, has since been lost due tosubsequent restoration work in the south aisle. Mercifully, both versions of theinscription have been preserved.*16 [index_split_057.html#filepos917453]8[index_split_058.html#filepos993137] As you can see, it is a fitting epitaph tothe churchman’s life and work, in particular his search for the terrestrialParadise:> Reader, if you love piety, if you know how to value learning, you should know> what a treasure lies under this stone, Marmaduke Carver, formerly rector of> the Church of Harthill, but very well versed in . . . chronology and> geography, an accomplished linguist, a fine speaker—the man, to wit, who . . .> pointed out to the world the true place of the terrestrial paradise, (yet in> death) made of the object of his admonitions, the celestial (paradise) which> he recommended to the praise of his hearers to attain which we are filled with> great longing. He was translated on this day of August 1665.9> [index_split_058.html#filepos993344]During his stay in York, Carver had apparently spent much of his time conductingresearch for his book in the cathedral library, which is the largest of its kindin the country. It has a collection of around 120,000 volumes, 25,000 of whichwere printed before 1801, including 115 incunabula (tracts printed before 1501).So it seemed only fitting that I should find that York Minster Library has twoof the only remaining copies of Carver’s book in the country. Some cunningpersuasion helped overturn the librarian’s decision not to allow me to view thetitle at such short notice, so I sat down ready to read what I hoped wouldprovide me with some valuable insights regarding the true whereabouts of theGarden of Eden. I was not to be disappointed.THE GREAT FIRE OF LONDONThe small, leather-bound book placed before me on the reading desk felt veryspecial indeed. It was printed in April 1666 by James Flesher of London and soldby one Samuel Thomson “at the Bishop’s head in St. Paul’s Church-yard” (seefigure 28.1). Now, it is important to conjure a vision of the time, for 1666 wasthe year of the Great Fire of London, which burned from the second to the fifthof September and started in a bakery in Pudding Lane. This is just over 1,000yards (1 kilometer) away from Saint Paul’s Cathedral, where Samuel Thomson hadhis bookshop at the sign of the Bishop’s Head (probably located in the inn’sthoroughfare). So unless this copy of Carver’s book had sold in the monthsleading up to the fire, it must have been among the stock salvaged after thefire had swept through Saint Paul’s churchyard, razing the old cathedral to theground. I almost expected the book to exude a residual aroma of smoke and fireas I began to digest Carver’s findings on the true location of the terrestrialParadise.[images/00130.jpg]Figure 28.1. The cover of A Discourse of the Terrestrial Paradise, by theReverend Marmaduke Carver, published in London, England, in 1666. It wasarguably the first book to build a solid case for the terrestrial Paradise beinglocated in historical Armenia.A MERE UTOPIAThe tract’s opening address, dedicated to Gilbert Sheldon, the archbishop ofCanterbury, makes it clear that the author has written the book in an attempt todispel antiscriptorial thinking, begun in earnest by Martin Luther (1483–1546),which asserted that the Garden of Eden was “a mere Utopia, a Fiction of a placethat never was, to the manifest and designed undermining of the Authority andVeracity of the Holy Text.”10 [index_split_058.html#filepos993556] After this,in a long forward, Carver makes his case against the current most popular theoryon the location of the terrestrial Paradise, that it was located where theTigris and Euphrates rivers converge in Lower Mesopotamia, a view held, he says,not only by Calvinist reformers, but also by some Papist, or Catholic,scholars.11 [index_split_058.html#filepos993719]Having successfully rebutted this theory, Carver proceeds, in a sound, scholarlymanner, to build a case for Eden being located in Armenia Major, now part ofeastern Turkey. Significantly, he explores ancient evidence suggesting that theEuphrates, Tigris, and Araxes rivers all derive from the same source.12[index_split_058.html#filepos993824] This, he says, was a single “fountain” inthe “forests of Armenia,”13 [index_split_058.html#filepos993930] situated in thevicinity of a lake known anciently as Thonitis, or Thospites,14[index_split_058.html#filepos994036] called also Arianias, or Arsissa,15[index_split_058.html#filepos994150] all names usually associated with Lake Van.Carver cites the belief of various classical writers, including Strabo16[index_split_058.html#filepos994256] and Pliny,17[index_split_058.html#filepos994399] that some kind of proto-river, the truesource of the Tigris, emerged from a primordial fountain, then discharged intothe Thospites, or Lake Van, its waters so rapid, so powerful, that they did notmix with those of the “nitrous lake.” The proto-Tigris then reemerged beyond thelake’s southwest corner and sank down into a subterranean cave, only to reappearon the south side of the Eastern Taurus Mountains in the former Armenianprovince of Sophene, north of Diyarbakır. This then becomes the open source ofthe Tigris, which is known today as the Tigris Tunnel, or Birkleyn, from theArabic birqat al-’ayn, “source of the river.”Carver believed it was this primordial fountain, the true source of the Tigris,that brought forth the four rivers of Paradise.18[index_split_058.html#filepos994832] With this in mind, he concludes hisscholarly discourse by proposing that the site of Eden, or “Heden” as he marksit on the accompanying map (see figure 28.2), was to be found between Sophene“and the fountains of Tigris, in the midst whereof, and upon the bank of theriver, stood the Tree of Life. . . . Just about which place . . . we see . . .the nitrous Lake Thospites.”19 [index_split_058.html#filepos994988]CHERUBIM WITH THE FLAMING SWORDSCarver points out that after the proto-Tigris passes through the Thospites, itwas said by the classical writers to reemerge in the region of Mount Niphates.20[index_split_058.html#filepos995100] This is the ancient name for Nemrut Dağ,the volcanic caldera situated just beyond Van’s western shoreline. Havingconcluded that the Fountain of Paradise lay between here and Sophene, orimmediately south of the plain of Mush, he proposes that the cherubim, which Godset up to guard the Tree of Life with flaming swords turning every way, were infact the “flashings issuing out of some Lakes.”21[index_split_058.html#filepos995296]This is a very clever solution. Such “flashings” might easily describe thevolcanic activity attached to Nemrut Dağ, which has erupted periodically sinceancient times, the last time being in 1891, when the summit started “vomitingforth flames and lava,” destroying the villages at the base of the mountain.22[index_split_058.html#filepos995452]On this same matter, the Reverend W. A. Wigram and Sir Edgar T. A. Wigram intheir book The Cradle of Mankind, published in 1914 following their celebratedtravels in Kurdistan (eastern Turkey, northern Syria, northeast Iraq, andwestern Iran), observed:> It is held by many commentators that the site of the Garden of Eden was near> modern Van and Bitlis, round about the headwaters of the Euphrates, the> Tigris, the Araxes, and the Zab. If so, then the Garden of Eden now lies> buried beneath the lava of these volcanoes; and where could we find fitter> antitypes of the Cherubim with the flaming swords?23> [index_split_058.html#filepos995669]It is unlikely that the Wigrams were aware of Carver’s work when they wrotetheir book. However, their statements suggesting that the volcanoes, as naturalboundaries to the Garden of Eden, were themselves the cherubim wielding theflaming swords echo Carver’s thoughts completely.And if the Garden of Eden is not encased in volcanic lava, then it could equallyhave been drowned, for one old Armenian legend asserts that it lies “at thebottom of Lake Van,” where it has been since the time of the Great Flood.24[index_split_058.html#filepos995813] This conclusion reflects the medievalbelief that even if a terrestrial Paradise had once existed, then it wouldsurely have been destroyed at the time of the Flood, which covered everything tothe height of the highest mountains.CARVER’S MAP OF PARADISETurning next to Marmaduke Carver’s detailed, though rather fantastic, map ofGreater Armenia (see figure 28.2), we see the terrestrial Paradise marked underthe Latin legend Heden regio quae et anthe (Eden region and caves). These wordsare sandwiched between the Thospites, or Lake Van, in the east, and Sophene inthe west. Indeed, the inscription appears in the vicinity of the Eastern TaurusMountains, which lie immediately beneath the plain of Mush, with eden derivingmost probably from the Akkadian word edinu (Sumerian eden), meaning “plain” or“steppe.”25 [index_split_058.html#filepos995957] Having said this, a recentacademic trend sees eden as stemming from the West Semitic root ‘dn, meaning “toenrich, make abundant,”26 [index_split_058.html#filepos996085] which remainspossible, although less likely.MOUNT ABUSPassing across Thospites Lake on Carver’s map are two parallel lines that runnorth-south, representing the proto-Tigris flowing unaffected through itswaters. They continue as dotted lines beyond the lake’s northern shores,indicating that this is the incoming subterranean river alluded to in thewritings of classical writers, such as Strabo and Pliny, and that at its sourcewas the primordial foundation from which all four rivers of Paradise took theircourse. Geographically, the lines originate from between a line of mountains,one of which is marked with the legend “Abus Mons.”Abus Mons, or Mount Abus, also spelled Monte Abas,27[index_split_058.html#filepos996227] or Aba,28[index_split_058.html#filepos996498] is mentioned in the works of both Pliny29[index_split_058.html#filepos996682] and Strabo, the latter of whom writes thatfrom its summit “flow both the Euphrates and the Araxes, the former towards thewest and the latter towards the east.”30 [index_split_058.html#filepos996783]This can only be a reference to Bingöl Mountain, of which it is said: “TheAraxes rises near Erzurum (Turkey) in the Bingöl Dağ region: there is only a lowdivide separating it from the headwaters of the Euphrates river.”31[index_split_058.html#filepos996926] We should recall that Bingöl was the centerof the obsidian trade in the Armenian Highlands in the proto-Neolithic age andcan also be identified with Gaylaxaz-ut, or Paxray, the Wolf Stone Mountain ofArmenian folklore (see chapter 24).[images/00004.jpg]Figure 28.2. Section from Marmaduke Carver’s A Discourse of the TerrestrialParadise showing “Heden,” or Eden, between Lake Van (the Thospites, in thecenter) and the ancient kingdom of Sophene. Note the proto-Tigris coming downfrom the north, close to Abus Mons (Bingöl Mountain), and flowing uninterruptedthrough the lake.THE SOURCE OF MANY RIVERSDutch scholar of Semitic studies Martijn Theodoor Houtsma (1851–1943), in theEncyclopaedia of Islam, made it even clearer in 1927, when he wrote: “No fewerthan six important water-courses rise in this erosion [i.e., Bingöl Mountain’sinnumerable glacial pools], in which Armenian tradition for this reason placesthe site of the biblical Paradise.”32 [index_split_058.html#filepos997247] These“water-courses” are broken down in the following manner: in the northwest is thesource of the Araxes, in the west is the Tuzla Şu, which becomes a major branchof the Western, or Northern, Euphrates, and the Bingöl (or Peri) Şu, which, aswe saw in chapter 24, was known to the native Armenian population as the Gail,or “Wolf,” River. It too rises on the west side of Bingöl Mountain, then headsoff in the direction of Baghir and Shaitan Dağ. In the southwest part of themassif rises the Gönük Şu; in the south, the Çabughar Şu; and in the east andnortheast, the Khınis Şu. The last four mentioned rivers, including the Peri Şu,all join the Eastern, or Southern, Euphrates.What was it that led the Reverend Marmaduke Carver to conclude that theprimordial fountain that gave rise to the four rivers of Paradise existed in thesame mountain range as Abus Mons, in other words Bingöl Mountain? Was he awareof Strabo’s reference to Abus Mons as the source of both the Euphrates andAraxes?33 [index_split_058.html#filepos997418] It is possible, although if thiswere the case then surely he would have mentioned it. More likely is that it wasquite simply an intuitive decision based on whatever evidence he had in handwhen he came to write his fascinating book.Strangely, Carver does not identify the Gihon with the Araxes, nor does heassociate the Greater Zab with the Pison. Instead, he sees major waterways thatsplit away from the Tigris and Euphrates as evidence for the existence of theseother two rivers. The Pison, for instance, he has entering neighboring Persiaand linking, eventually, to the Indus, one of the longest rivers in Asia. Yetthis vagueness should not detract from Carver’s remarkable insights into thegeographical location of the Garden of Eden, and we are by no means finishedwith his findings quite yet.I felt the need now to focus my efforts more toward Bingöl Mountain, the AbusMons of antiquity, in an attempt to better understand why Carver believed thathere somewhere was the primordial fountain of life, and why the Dutch scholarMartijn Houtsma concluded that this was “the site of the biblical Paradise.”"},{"pageContent":"29THE WORLD’S SUMMITBingöl is a Turkish place-name that means “a thousand (bin) lakes or springs(göl),” an allusion to the many mountain streams that take their rise from theglacial lakes that grace its summit. In the Armenian language, Bingöl Mountainis known as Biurakn, which means “a million (bir, byur) eyes (akn),” areference, once again, to the countless springs, or “eyes,” that take their riseon its summit (although see chapter 33 for a clearer interpretation of thisArmenian name).Bingöl is mentioned also in Armenian texts under the more enigmatic name ofMount Srmantz, or Srmanç1 [index_split_058.html#filepos997828] (again, seechapter 33 for a discussion of the meaning of this name), described as KatarErkri, the Summit of the Earth,2 [index_split_058.html#filepos997986] or theWorld’s Summit,3 [index_split_058.html#filepos998157] or, indeed, the Top of theWorld, from which flowed the “four rivers to the four corners of the world.”4[index_split_058.html#filepos998300] Bingöl was also a “place of the gods,”5[index_split_058.html#filepos998405] the habitation of mythical beingsidentified, almost certainly, with the Peri of Kurdish and Persian folklore (theregion’s population until the early twentieth century were mainly Armenians,Kurds, Turks, Yezidi, and Kızılbaş [Alevi], the last two being ethno-religiousgroups quite separate from the others mentioned here).Very probably, the Judeo-Christian belief in the four rivers of Paradise flowingout of the Garden of Eden (see figure 29.1, for instance) is simply a variationof the cosmic mountain theme preserved in connection with Bingöl Mountain by theArmenian inhabitants of the region. It was probably for this reason that MartijnHoutsma, in 1927, noted that Armenians considered it “the site of the biblicalParadise,”6 [index_split_058.html#filepos998505] which, if correct, should beextended southward to include the plain of Mush, the proposed site of the Gardenof Eden itself.[images/00020.jpg]Figure 29.1. Section of a map of the Middle East by French cartographer andgeographer Philippe Buache (1700–1773), published in 1783. Eden is shown to thewest of Lake Van, placing it in the vicinity of the Mush Plain and ArmenianHighlands. Confusingly, the identities of the Pison and Gihon rivers aretransposed: the Araxes is shown as the Pison (written “Phison”), while theGreater Zab becomes the Gihon (written “Gehon”).Having said this, we know that the Genesis account of the earthly Paradisedescribes real rivers, three of which—the Tigris, Euphrates, and Araxes—wereconsidered to take their rise from the same primordial fountain that existedsomewhere in the vicinity of the Bingöl massif. Only one of the rivers, thePison, remains somewhat of an enigma, even though the Assyrian Church, as we sawin chapter 27, identifies it with the Greater Zab, which rises in the mountainssoutheast of Lake Van.THE PISON RIVER—NEW EVIDENCEHaving said this, compelling evidence suggests that the Pison was also once seento take its rise on Bingöl Mountain and is to be identified with the Peri Şu, orGail River. This flows initially westward before turning south to merge,eventually, with the Eastern Euphrates just north of the ancient fortress townof Kharput, thought to be Carcathiocerta, the lost capital of Sophene.This connection between the Pison River and the Peri Şu is recorded in a bookwritten in 1870 by German cartographers Wilhelm Strecker and Heinrich Kiepert.7[index_split_058.html#filepos998675] It examines the geography of the Anabasis,a seven-volume work penned by Greek professional soldier and writer Xenophon(ca. 430–354 BC). He marched with the ten thousand Greek mercenaries hired byCyrus the Younger, who sought to wrest the throne of Persia from his brother,the king, Artaxerxes II.8 [index_split_058.html#filepos998900] The route of theTen Thousand, as they are known, to and from the Battle of Cunaxa on the banksof the Euphrates, some 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of Babylon, took themthrough Colchis (modern Georgia), Armenia, and Mesopotamia. The identity of therivers, towns, and cities Xenophon describes encountering on this two-wayjourney has been the subject of debate among scholars for hundreds of years.The Ten Thousand are known to have marched through the foothills of the Bingölmassif, and discussing the sights they might have encountered Streker andKiepert make the following observation:> The native people spoken to on my trips to Armenia Major, call this river> [i.e., the Peri Şu] Phison, and see it as a river of Paradise, [which they> say] lies on Bingöl Mountain.1 That this is not an arbitrary adoption of> modern times is proved by the ancient Armenian writer who indicates the> existence of a Castell Phison in Sophene, probably identical with the area> between the two Euphrates.9 [index_split_058.html#filepos999253]The superscript number 1 after the word “Mountain” in the original text refersthe reader to the base of the page. Here we read that although the inhabitantsof the region assert the Peri Şu to be the “Phison,” the authors have beenunable to verify this claim among the works of the Armenian writers.10[index_split_058.html#filepos999420]This is a shame. Yet we are still left with the tantalizing possibility that thePeri Şu is the Pison, even though this new information is unlikely to constitutea major challenge to the Greater Zab’s claim to being the self-same river. Asstated in chapter 27, the word of the ancient Assyrian Church should not betaken lightly, especially as the Armenian Church seems to have a tendency tomove around holy places (the case of the ark’s Place of Descent being a primeexample—see chapter 30).Having said this, the fact that the Armenian population of Armenia Majorbelieved that the Peri Şu was the Pison now links the sources of all four riversof Paradise with the area around Bingöl Mountain, which, we should not forget,was known in Armenian tradition as Katar Erkri, the Summit of the Earth, itswaters carrying the “four rivers to the four corners of the world.”*17[index_split_057.html#filepos918096]11 [index_split_058.html#filepos999531]FOUNTAIN OF LIFEQuite independent of Judeo-Christian tradition, Muslim Kurds revere BingölMountain as the site of another heavenly, paradisiacal fountain of great renown.Here is to be found Ma’ul Hayat, the Fountain of Life, the waters of which canrejuvenate youth and provide everlasting life.12[index_split_058.html#filepos999680]According to popular legend, Alexander the Great (called in Persian Iskender andin Turkish Zülkarneyn, meaning “the Horned One” or “the Two-horned,” a referenceto the ram horns on his helmet) traveled to “the land of darkness,” beyond thesetting sun, in search of the Fountain of Life, which was said to exist “in thenorth, beneath the Pole Star.”13 [index_split_058.html#filepos999825] His guideand vizier on the journey was the mysterious al-Khidr, a wise man; however, whenthey came to a fork in the road, both men went in different directions. Onlyal-Khidr ended up finding the Fountain of Life and drinking from its waters (oreating a fish that swims in the fountain in another version; see figure 29.2).Even though al-Khidr waited for Alexander to catch up, the fountain disappearedas he approached. Al-Khidr also then vanished, having been granted immortalityby Allah.Although the Persian and Turkish accounts of Alexander’s journey do not mentionBingöl by name, local Kurdish folklore does. Its version of the story tells howAlexander, with deep wounds and pains in his body, went in search of the Ab’iHayat, the Waters of Life, which he found in the vicinity of Bingöl Mountain(named Jabal-i-çur). Here he either drinks or bathes in its waters, an act thatcures his ailments. In honor of this miracle Alexander chooses a spot on anearby river and builds a castle called Çapakçur,14[index_split_058.html#filepos1000033] this being the old name for the town ofBingöl, which lies a short distance from the mountain.[images/00037.jpg]Figure 29.2. Al-Khidr (Turkish Hızır), the Green One, who gains immortality atthe Ma’ul Hayat, the Fountain of Life, thought to be located in the vicinity ofBingöl Mountain.AL-KHIDR, THE GREEN ONEAl-Khidr, called in Turkish Hızır, means the “Green One.” He features in theHoly Qur’an,15 [index_split_058.html#filepos1000313] as well as in Persianliterature and various non-Islamic sources, as a mysterious figure, anever-youthful “servant of Allah” who appears at the right moment to avert adisaster or rectify a fatalistic situation. There are many accounts of peoplewho encounter a bearded holy figure only to find afterward that it was al-Khidr.He is a saint and a holy man, as well as the spiritual head of the Sufimovement, the so-called qutb, the intermediary between Allah and humankind. Heis also identified with Saint George and shares the same feast date as him,which is April 23. Some even see the presence of al-Khidr in the proliferationof carved foliate heads, or Green Men, in Norman churches and cathedrals.16[index_split_058.html#filepos1000430]THE CULT OF ENKIAl-Khidr himself was originally, most probably, a deity belonging toMesopotamian myth and legend. Very likely he is linked with Enki, the Sumeriangod of creation, water, and intelligence, known in the Akkadian and Babylonianlanguage as Ea. In art Enki is generally shown as a human figure wearing ahorned helmet with streams of water emerging from his shoulders, like twinfountains (see figure 29.3). Within the flow fish swim upstream, like salmontrying to reach the source of a river. These twin streams represent the Tigrisand Euphrates,17 [index_split_058.html#filepos1000561] over which Enki presidedas god of Eridu, an ancient Mesopotamian city located on the shores of the Shattal-Arab waterway, where the two rivers come together before emptying into thePersian Gulf. However, there is no reason why Enki should not also have beenconnected with the sources of these mighty rivers.[images/00052.jpg]Figure 29.3. The Sumerian Anunnaki god Enki (Akkadian Ea, Armenian Haya), withthe twin streams of the Euphrates and Tigris emerging from his shoulders.In Sumero-Akkadian mythology the Tigris and Euphrates were said to take theirrise from a primordial water source, a subterranean lake that was the source ofall “sweet water” called the Abzu (also written Apsu), which came under thepatronage of Enki.In his Semitic form as Ea, Enki was venerated in Urartu, the ancient kingdomthat thrived between the Eastern Taurus Mountains and the Armenian Highlandsduring the last quarter of the second millennium BC and the first half of thefirst millennium BC, under the name Haya or Hayya.18[index_split_058.html#filepos1000714] His importance at that time is preservedin Armenia’s Persian name, which is Hayastan, and also in its original Urartianname, which is Hayasa.19 [index_split_058.html#filepos1000866] Even today theArmenian term for “Republic of Armenia” is Hayastani Hanrapetutiun. Thisindicates very strongly that this region, which includes Bingöl Mountain, wasformerly associated with the cult of Haya, or Ea, the patron of the Tigris andEuphrates rivers, which, as we have seen, emerge as twin streams from hisshoulders.In Armenian folklore Haya was transformed into the culture hero Hayk,20[index_split_058.html#filepos1001006] who was said to have slain Bel, a Titanand king of Babylon synonymous with the biblical character Nimrod. Traditionasserts that before the battle Hayk visited Bingöl Mountain and here immersedhis sword in the icy waters of one of its glacial lakes in order to sharpenit.21 [index_split_058.html#filepos1001112] After Hayk had killed Bel on theshores of Lake Van, the Titan’s body was apparently buried on the summit ofnearby Nemrut Dağ, which is named in honor of Nimrod.DILMUN—GARDEN OF THE GODSEnki, Ea, or Haya, was associated with a mythical location called Dilmun, a kindof garden of creation, inhabited by him and his wife in an act that initiated “asinless age of complete happiness,” where animals lived in peace and harmony,humans had no rivals, and the god Enlil “in one tongue gave praise.”22[index_split_058.html#filepos1001365] It was also a pure, clean, bright “abodeof the immortals,” where death, disease, and sorrow were unknown,23[index_split_058.html#filepos1001515] and some mortals were given “life like agod.”24 [index_split_058.html#filepos1001648] One text describes Dilmun as aplace “where the raven did not croak and wolves and lion did not devour theirprey.”25 [index_split_058.html#filepos1001749]Even though Dilmun was a name given by the Sumerians to the island of Bahrain inthe Persian Gulf, originally it was a mountainous region that overlooked theMesopotamia Basin. One text speaks of “the mountain of Dilmun. The place wherethe sun rises.”26 [index_split_058.html#filepos1001903]Some texts refer to Dilmun as the “land of Cedars,” and Mehrdad Izady, professorof Near East studies at New York University, has successfully shown that this isa reference not to distant Lebanon, the country normally celebrated for itscedar forests, but to the Upper Zagros Mountains as far north as Lake Van.27[index_split_058.html#filepos1002043] Cedar forests grew here in abundance untilthe end of the Neolithic era, when they were cut down and used by the Sumeriansand Akkadians to build their towns and cities, which thrived down on the Iraqiplain.THE DIMLI KURDSThe Bundahishn, the holy book of the Zoroastrians, actually locates a placecalled Dilamân “at the headwaters of the Tigris,”28[index_split_058.html#filepos1002167] while the archives of the Assyrian Church,located in the ancient city of Arbil in northern Iraq, refer to Beth Dailômâye,the “land of the Daylamites” as existing in the same region.29[index_split_058.html#filepos1002273] The Daylamites were a Kurdish tribaldynasty whose original homeland was Daylamân, or Dilamân, a region of theArmenian Highlands,30 [index_split_058.html#filepos1002379] where their moderndescendants, the Dimila, or Dimli, Kurds live today. Their actual territoryextends from the city of Erzincan and the province of Tunceli in the west,across to the Murad Şu, or Eastern Euphrates, in the east.It is an area that includes Bingöl and the northern parts of the plain of Mush,making it clear that the geographical location of the terrestrial Paradiseappears to be synonymous with the Mesopotamian concept of Dilmun; the two mostlikely deriving from the same culture that once saw the region as the locationof the Abzu, the primordial water source that fed every river, lake, and sea inthe ancient world.The Dimli Kurds are a distinct ethnic community with very few connections to theMuslim Kurds of the region. They have their own language, called Zâzâ or Gurani,and belong to a very ancient religion called Alevi (also known as Kızılbaş,meaning “red heads,” a reference to their distinctive red headgear). Althoughconsidered to have been introduced to eastern Turkey from southwest Iran,Alevism probably contains religious elements deriving from the beliefs andpractices of the Arevordi, or Arewordik, the “children of the sun,”31[index_split_058.html#filepos1002480] who are classed as a type of ArmenianZoroastrian.32 [index_split_058.html#filepos1002685] They practiced exposure ofthe dead on rooftops (i.e., excarnation) and entered subterranean “pits” fortheir rites—practices reminiscent of the early Neolithic peoples who lived inthis same region thousands of years earlier.33[index_split_058.html#filepos1002837]THE FOUNTAIN OF HIZIRMore significantly, the Alevi revere Hızır (pronounced his-sheer), the Turkishform of al-Khidr, whose most sacred shrine is Hızır Çeşmesi, the Fountain ofHızır, a mountain spring with accompanying fountain that emerges from the baseof a tree in the foothills northwest of Bingöl Mountain, close to the town ofVarto (ancient Gimgim). Alevi come from all over Turkey to venerate Hızır atthis shrine. They take water from the fountain, which is believed to haverejuvenating properties, and spend the night in a small, unassuming buildingnext door in order to experience dreams of the saint. This practice, known asdream incubation, is an extremely ancient means of communication withsupernatural forces, and to find that it still occurs at the base of BingölMountain is quite extraordinary.Whether the Fountain of Hızır is considered to be the original Ma’ul Hayat,Fountain of Life, or the Ab’i Hayat, Waters of Life, is unclear, although theconnection is indisputable. Clearly, this holy spring cannot have been theactual source of the rivers of Paradise, because each river rises from adifferent location on the mountain’s summit. Perhaps some kind of primordialfountain, as imagined by the Reverend Marmaduke Carver, was thought to existwithin the mountain itself. Perhaps this was seen to feed the glacial lakes thatare the true source of the many rivers and streams that take their rise on themountain, accounting for the name Bingöl, which, as we have seen, means “aThousand Lakes”; that is, boundless sources of water.Was this also the origin of the concept of the Abzu, the primordial water sourceof Mesopotamian mythology presided over by Enki, who lived with his wife in theparadisiacal realm of Dilmun? Was the Alevi shrine of Hızır Çeşmesi, theFountain of Hızır, some distant echo of these beliefs, which we can only assumesprang from this very region many thousands of years ago?The fountain’s current genius loci, certainly among the Alevi, is Hızır, afigure that can almost certainly be identified with Haya, the Armenian form ofEnki or Ea, guardian of the Abzu. Might the Alevi, as the descendants of theDaylamân, or Dilamân, hold some special knowledge regarding the former existencein their midst of Dilmun? As we see next, this paradisiacal realm was synonymouswith another location in Mesopotamian myth and legend, this being the Dukumound, birthplace of the Anunnaki gods."},{"pageContent":"30RISE OF THE ANUNNAKIKlaus Schmidt may have regretted talking to British journalist Sean Thomas, whowould later write that the German archaeologist claimed that Göbekli Tepe was a“temple in Eden.” It has not, however, stopped Schmidt from speculating aboutthe effect the site might have had on the civilizations that flourished on theMesopotamia Plain from around 3000 BC onward.In his book Göbekli Tepe: A Stone Age Sanctuary in South-eastern Anatolia,published in its English language version for the first time in 2012, Schmidtspeculates that the Göbekli builders may have derived from a shamanic societyand that the T-shaped pillars perhaps represent their great ancestors. Muchlater, the memories of these powerful individuals were transformed into storiesrelating to deities called the Anunna gods of heaven (an) and earth (ki), knownalso as the Anunnaki.According to the myths and legends of the Sumerians and Akkadians—the peoplesthat thrived down on the Mesopotamian Plain during the third millennium BC—thebirthplace and abode of the Anunnaki was the Duku, a Sumerian word meaning “holymound.” Here was created the first sheep and grain, which were then given by thegods Enki and Enlil to humankind, who lived down below. This is very clearly anallusion to the origins of animal husbandry and agriculture, which, as we haveseen, took place in the triangle d’or at the time of the Neolithic evolution. AsKlaus Schmidt puts it himself:> Can these arguments be connected, is it possible that behind Göbekli Tepe> there hides Mount Du-ku, and are the anthropomorphous pillars of Göbekli> Tepe—suddenly surprisingly real—the ancient Anuna Gods?1> [index_split_058.html#filepos1003017]Incredibly, these same ideas regarding the origins of the Anunnaki being amemory of the prime movers behind the Neolithic revolution in southeast Anatoliawere put forward by the current author in his book From the Ashes of Angels,published in 1996, and written as Schmidt was surveying the mountaintopsanctuary of Göbekli Tepe for the first time. That the German archaeologist nowalso believes the catalyzing events of the Neolithic revolution might well bepreserved in the accounts of the Duku mound and the Anunnaki giving humankindthe rudiments of civilization is highly significant. Consequently, it isessential to ascertain the foundation point of these mythological traditions,and to find out whether they really do relate to Göbekli Tepe and its enigmaticT-shaped pillars.Although in the Sumerian language Duku means “holy (ku) mound (dul),” theequivalent of dul in Akkadian is tillu, cognate with the Arab tell, that is, anoccupational mound, very like Göbekli Tepe itself.2[index_split_058.html#filepos1003152] In fact, Mesopotamian scholar Jeremy Blackthinks it likely that as a mythological concept the Duku was seen as a prototypeof the many tells found scattered across the Mesopotamian Plain, many of whichwould already have been abandoned, even by the commencement of the Sumerian andAkkadian civilizations in the third millennium BC.3[index_split_058.html#filepos1003302]Just a riffle through the dirt and soil of any occupational mound very quicklyproduces potsherds, worked flints, and even human remains, which might easilyhave been seen as material evidence of the former presence on earth of the gods.The existence of these tells is most likely the root behind not only the Dukumound of Sumerian mythology but also the primeval mounds featured in the mythsand legends of other ancient civilizations, where they are seen as the firstbuilt structures to occupy the earth (those that feature in ancient Egyptiantexts as the foundation points of pharaonic civilization being prime examples).The Duku was therefore a primeval mound, the place of origin of the earliestancestor gods, built where earth and heaven come together. These ancestor godswere so old that when eventually superceded by later deities, they were seen tohave withdrawn into a nebulous world existing within the mound itself, whichthereafter acted as a conduit into this netherworld, known as the Kur.4[index_split_058.html#filepos1003402]The holy mound thus became an entrance to the Kur, a word meaning also “foreignland” and “mountain.” Indeed, some scholars see the word kur as the origin of“kurd,” the name given to the foreign inhabitants of the north, from which wederive the term Kurds and Kurdistan.5 [index_split_058.html#filepos1003674] Yethaving said this the Duku also came to be identified, like Dilmun, with the“Mountain of the Spring,” from which the sun emerged each morning.6[index_split_058.html#filepos1003826] This association comes from the fact that,like the sun-god in ancient Egyptian tradition who was thought to pass throughthe Duat, or underworld, from sunset to sunrise, the sun-god in Mesopotamiantradition similarly passed through the Kur, or netherworld, to emerge from acavelike opening in the Duku mound. Thus the Kur, as both the mountainous landof foreigners and the realm of the dead, came to be associated with the land ofdarkness, in other words the north, the only direction that the sun does notreach in the Northern Hemisphere.Although ancient Mesopotamian cities often possessed their own representationsof the Duku mound, somewhere out in the mythological world was the original one,where the genesis of the Anunnaki gods took place. So was Schmidt correct toidentify the Duku with Göbekli Tepe?MOUNTAIN OF THE GODSAncient texts tell us the Duku mound existed as part of a much larger hill ormountain called Kharsag (or hursagËœ), known as Kharsag-gal-kurkura, “greatmountain of all lands.”7 [index_split_058.html#filepos1003989] It acted as asupport on which the heavens rested and around which the stars revolved in anunerring fashion, showing it to be a cosmic mountain or world mountain.Although Kharsag, like the Duku mound, is sometimes described as the Mountain ofthe East,8 [index_split_058.html#filepos1004143] an allusion to the direction ofthe rising sun, it is also occasionally situated in the north,9[index_split_058.html#filepos1004275] the direction of the Eastern TaurusMountains and the Armenian Highlands. So where exactly was Kharsag, if indeed itwas a physical location?THE NIPPUR FOUNDATION CYLINDEROne Sumero-Akkadian inscription, dating to around 2600 BC and found on aterra-cotta cylinder deposited in the foundations of the “Mountain House”(E-kur) of the god Enlil in the city of Nippur in southern Iraq, speaks ofKharsag in direct association with the Tigris and Euphrates rivers:> > > > The holy Tigris, the holy Euphrates,> > > > The holy scepter of Enlil> > > > Establish Kharsag;> > > > They give abundance.> > > > His scepter protects (?);> > > > [to] its lord, a prayer . . .> > > > the sprouts of the land.10 [index_split_058.html#filepos1004415]Unless this is a reference to the mouths of the Tigris and Euphrates, it impliesthat the two great rivers were seen to sprout forth from Kharsag, the Mountainof the World. That Kharsag might be an actual mountain to the north or northeastof Mesopotamia has long been realized, although most usually it is identifiedwith Mount Ararat,11 [index_split_058.html#filepos1004567] a sacred mountain ineastern Turkey of paramount importance to Christian tradition.It was here, we are told, that Noah’s ark came to rest after the Great Flood,although this, as we shall see, is a complete misnomer. The original Genesisaccount says only that the ark came to rest “on [the] mountains of Ararat (Gen.8:4),” a reference to the kingdom of Ararat. This is the Hebrew name for Urartu,which appears in Assyrian and Babylonian literature for the first time aroundthe thirteenth century BC. At its height Urartu stretched from the EasternTaurus Mountains in the south all the way to the Caucasus Mountains in thenorth, with its main heartland being in the region of the Armenian Highlands andLake Van. Never does the Bible allude directly to Mount Ararat. Yet this has notstopped overzealous clergy members, theologians, and scholars identifying theso-called Place of Descent, where Noah’s ark made landfall, with the tallestmountain in Armenia, which is Mount Massis, popularly known today as MountArarat.MOUNT AL-JUDIMount Massis is unquestionably a mountain very sacred in Armenian tradition, andevidence of human activity here goes back to prehistoric times. Yet nothingbefore the fifth century AD associates it with the story of Noah’s ark. Indeed,the inhabitants of the region point out another mountain as the true Place ofDescent. This is Mount al-Judi, the modern Cudi Dağ, close to the Turkish-Syrianborder. At the foot of the mountain is the town of Cizre, which traditionasserts is the site of Thamanin, the settlement established by Noah and hisfamily after leaving the ark.Mount al-Judi is the Place of Descent recognized by Babylonian Jews, Christiansof the Assyrian Church, Muslims (as stated in the Holy Qur’an’s Sura 11:44),Yezidis (a Kurdish angel-worshipping religion), and “Chaldeans,”12[index_split_058.html#filepos1004718] a reference to the peoples of NorthernMesopotamia. This same mountain is asserted to be the landing place of Noah’sark by Berossus (a Babylonian historian, ca. 250 BC) and Abydenus (a Greekhistorian, ca. 200 BC), who stated that inhabitants thereabouts “scraped thepitch off the planks as a rarity, and carried it about them for an amulet,”while “the wood of the vessel (was used) against many diseases with wonderfulsuccess.”13 [index_split_058.html#filepos1004863]According to English Orientalist George Sale (1697–1736), who made an Englishtranslation of the Holy Qur’an published in 1734, relics of the ark were “seenhere in the time of Epiphanius [a famous church leader who lived at the end offourth century AD], if we may believe him; and we are told the [Byzantine]emperor Heraclius [who ruled AD 610–641] went from the town of Thamanin up tothe mountain al Jûdi, and saw the place of the ark.”14[index_split_058.html#filepos1004964]Sale mentions also that there was once an ancient monastery on the summit ofMount al-Judi, which was destroyed by lightning in AD 776. After this time,belief that the mountain was the Place of Descent declined, its place taken byMount Massis, called by the Turks Agri Dağ and by the Christians Mount Ararat.15[index_split_058.html#filepos1005065]THE SWITCH TO MOUNT MASSISThe Armenian Church was directly responsible for transferring the Place ofDescent from Mount al-Judi to the more northerly Mount Massis,16[index_split_058.html#filepos1005166] a holy mountain under the jurisdiction ofthe Mother See of Holy Echmiadzin, a church and monastery located inVagharshapat, near the city of Erivan, or Yerevan, the capital of the Republicof Armenia (see figure 30.1). As the seat of the Catholicos, or head of theArmenian Church, Holy Echmiadzin is to the Armenians what the Vatican is to theCatholic Church. When viewed from Echmiadzin, Mount Massis seems to rise up fromthe surrounding plain to dominate the southern skyline.The change in location of the Place of Descent from Mount al-Judi to MountMassis was almost certainly political and occurred following the ruling of theCouncil of Ephesus in 431, which banned the ancient Assyrian Church from theOrthodox Catholic Church because of its unorthodox views on Christ’s dualistnature. At the time Mount al-Judi was under the jurisdiction of the AssyrianChurch, the Armenian Church’s southern rival, so a switch of interest away fromMount al-Judi to Mount Massis was deemed appropriate, as the Armenians did notwant the Assyrians to have control of this important place of pilgrimage.Yet before this time the Armenian Church was, seemingly, happy to accept Mountal-Judi as the site of the Place of Descent. This is brought out in an Armenianchronicle known as the Epic Histories, attributed to an Armenian historian namedFaustus of Byzantium, who lived in the fifth century. The book chronicles thevisit of Jacob (or James), the second bishop of Nisibis in Northern Mesopotamia,to Mount al-Judi. Here the “Armenian saint,” who was born at the end of thethird century, is said to have found the “wood of Noah’s Ark.”17[index_split_058.html#filepos1005327]Today, only Christians believe that Mount Ararat is the site where Noah’s arkcame to rest. Yet the sheer potency of this belief remains so strong that it hasinspired a number of high-profile attempts to locate the remains of the ark onthe slopes of Mount Ararat. All of these expeditions have either come to nothingor resulted in clandestine video footage of the alleged remains of a petrifiedboat, which becomes impossible to verify.The reason for diverting from the main theme of the chapter to cite these factsis that the Christian belief in the power of Mount Ararat has over the pastthree hundred years seriously clouded scholarly judgment regarding thegeographical placement of legendary locations connected with either NorthernMesopotamia or the Armenian Highlands. For instance, it was almost certainly theChristian obsession with Mount Ararat that led to its being identified withKharsag.18 [index_split_058.html#filepos1005428] Yet no major rivers take theirrise there, especially not the Tigris and Euphrates mentioned in the inscriptionrecorded on the Nippur foundation cylinder.Since it was anciently believed that the Tigris and Euphrates stemmed from thesame source, it is more likely that Kharsag should be identified with the Bingölmassif, which is located around 150 miles (240 kilometers) west-southwest ofMount Ararat. Just as the Armenians saw Bingöl Mountain as the Place of theGods, the Sumero-Akkadians saw Kharsag as “where the gods were born”19[index_split_058.html#filepos1005562] or “where the gods had their seat,”20[index_split_058.html#filepos1005713]an allusion to the presence thereabouts ofthe Duku mound, which, as we have seen, was very likely envisaged as a tell, anabandoned occupational mound, dating back to the age of the gods.[images/00070.jpg]Figure 30.1. Old print of Mount Ararat as seen from Erivan, modern Yerevan, theRepublic of Armenia’s capital and largest city.Interestingly, some accounts of the Duku mound speak of something called theAncient City,21 [index_split_058.html#filepos1005846] which was believed to havebeen built right on top of it, underneath which was the Abzu.22[index_split_058.html#filepos1006010] Although scholars consider that thisaccount relates to the ancient city of Eridu, which was under the patronage ofEnki and had its own representation of both the Duku mound and Abzu, chances arethat the concept of the Ancient City relates to a built structure existing onthe original Duku—one that was seen to sink down into the hill when its ancestorgods withdrew into the mound.THE NIPPUR FOUNDATION CYLINDERIn the 1980s British historical writer and geologist Christian O’Brien(1914–2001) made a careful study of the Nippur foundation cylinder (correctlyentitled the Barton Cylinder, after George A. Barton [1859–1942], the Canadianclergyman and professor of Semitic languages who first translated its text). Heconcluded that its inscription alluded to some kind of settlement of theAnunnaki existing in Kharsag, which he interpreted as meaning “principal fencedenclosure” or “lofty fenced enclosure.”23 [index_split_058.html#filepos1006111]It was a conviction reinforced by the fact that the Akkadian word edin, meaning“plain,” “plateau,” or “steppe,” is twice used in connection with this highland“settlement.”24 [index_split_058.html#filepos1006266] Was this the “AncientCity” existing on top of the Duku mound?Among the Anunnaki named in the Nippur foundation cylinder is the great lordEnlil, along with Enki, whom we have already met; Utu, or Ugmash, the sun god;Anu, whose name means “heaven”; and Enlil’s (usually Enki’s) consort,Ninkharsag, a name that translates as “Lady of the Sacred Mountain.”Significantly, she appears also under the Akkadian name Šir (the equivalent ofthe Sumerian Muš, pronounced mush),25 [index_split_058.html#filepos1006372]meaning “Serpent,” and is given the epithet Bê-lit, meaning “Divine Lady.”26[index_split_058.html#filepos1006524] Even though Mesopotamian scholar George A.Barton assumed that Šir was a “serpent goddess” venerated in the city ofNippur,27 [index_split_058.html#filepos1006630] O’Brien interpreted her name asmeaning “Serpent Lady”28 [index_split_058.html#filepos1006731] and identifiedher as one of the Anunnaki living in Kharsag.CULT OF THE SNAKEIt is curious that Ninkharsag, also called Šir (or Muš), the wife of Enlil orEnki, is seen as one of the Anunnaki living at Kharsag, for a cult of the snakeis known to have thrived on the plain of Mush (which in Turkish is written Muş).A medieval translation of a work by the fourth-century Armenian abbot Zenob Glaksays that snake worship was introduced to the kingdom of Taron, the ancient nameof Mush, by “Hindoos,” who arrived from the east in 149 BC.29[index_split_058.html#filepos1006882] They built cities and temples here thatwere destroyed by Gregory the Illuminator during his crusade against the pagansat the beginning of the fourth century AD. Apparently, the temples were locatedat Ashtishat, close to the road between Mush and Bingöl Mountain, whereafterward Surb Karapet, the Monastery of Saint John the Baptist, was built.This story suggests that Mush derives its name from the Sumerian Muš, theAkkadian Šir (pronounced shir), both meaning “snake” (even though in Armenianpopular tradition Mush, as the word mshush, means “fog,” a name deriving from astory in which the Armenian goddess Anahita raised a mist so that her daughterAstghik, goddess of love and beauty, could bathe without any mortal setting eyeson her nakedness). If so, then the ancient snake cult known to have existed atAshtishat (the principal seat of the goddess Astghik, whose symbol was thevishap, a word meaning “snake” or “dragon”) probably predates the arrival of the“Hindoos” and most likely relates to a time when the region was under thecontrol of one of the Mesopotamian civilizations. If so, then this has profoundimplications for the identification of Kharsag with Bingöl Mountain, and theGarden of Eden with the Mush Plain, for in his book The Genius of the Few,Christian O’Brien argues that the account of Kharsag preserved in the Nippurfoundation cylinder was perhaps the origin of the Genesis account of theterrestrial Paradise:> The parallels between this epic account and the Hebraic record at the Garden> of Eden are highly convincing. Not only is “Eden” twice mentioned, but the> reference to the “Serpent Lady”, as an epithet for Ninkharsag . . . [is] clear> confirmation of the scientific nature of the work carried out by the> equivalent Serpents in the Hebrew account.30> [index_split_058.html#filepos1007122]We shall meet with those Serpents of Hebrew tradition shortly, but for themoment it is important to explore O’Brien’s conclusions regarding Kharsag’sidentification as the original Garden of Eden. He located this mountainsettlement of the Anunnaki not at Bingöl Mountain in the Armenian Highlands butat Mount Hermon (modern Jabal al-Shaykh, “Mountain of the Chief ”), which formspart of the Anti-Lebanon range and straddles the border between Syria andLebanon, extending as far south as the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.NO CEDAR FORESTSO’Brien identified Mount Hermon with Kharsag primarily because the textassociates it with cedar forests. So even though the Sumero-Akkadians locatedtheir world mountain in the north, northeast, or even the east of what is todayIraq, O’Brien chose to place it in the extreme west, the direction of Lebanon’scelebrated cedar forests, because, in his opinion, there were no cedar forestsin the Zagros Mountains. Yet as we have seen, cedar forests existed in abundancethroughout the Zagros Mountains at the start of the Sumerian and Akkadiancivilizations. So thorough, however, was their extermination that much laterscribes interpreted references to cedar forests in ancient texts as alluding toLebanon in the far west. This was simply because the scribes were not aware thatcedar forests had once existed in the mountains to the north and northeast oftheir kingdoms. As a consequence, some versions of the famous Epic of Gilgameshhave its hero embarking on his quest for the plant of immortality and ending upin the vicinity of Lake Van and the Armenian Highlands, while others haveGilgamesh in Lebanon, traveling as far as Mount Hermon.31[index_split_058.html#filepos1007278]If Kharsag is to be geographically placed anywhere, then it is going to be inthe direction of the Eastern Taurus Mountains and Armenian Highlands, close toLake Van. What is more, if Kharsag really was established where the Tigris andEuphrates sprouted forth, as the Nippur foundation cylinder suggests, thislocates it in the vicinity of the Bingöl massif, making it the true “place ofthe gods,” in both Armenian and Mesopotamian tradition. Here too was the site ofthe terrestrial Paradise, which O’Brien was almost certainly right to identifywith Kharsag, and thus the Duku mound, where the Anunnaki lived and were firstcreated.Whether or not Göbekli Tepe can claim some credit as the original inspirationbehind the Duku mound, as Klaus Schmidt surmises, remains to be seen.Undoubtedly, it would have had some influence on the development of the variousmyths featuring the Duku mound, just in the same manner that the story of thefirst sheep and grain created on the Duku mound and given by the Anunnaki tohumankind is an abstract memory of the introduction of animal husbandry andsedentary farming in the triangle d’or. Having said this, the vision of the Dukuas an abandoned tell situated in a hilly or mountainous environment, on whichwas built the “Ancient City,” fits Göbekli Tepe perfectly. So in summary we cansay that the concept of the Duku—as handed down across the millennia, until itbecame a feature in the cosmological world of the Sumerians, Akkadians, andlater Babylonians and Assyrians—most likely constituted an amalgam of sites thatincluded Göbekli Tepe in the triangle d’or, and another now lost site in thevicinity of Bingöl Mountain in the Armenian Highlands.So who exactly were the Anunnaki, and what were they doing in the terrestrialParadise, where in biblical tradition Adam and Eve are placed after beingcreated by God? As we see next, in Mesopotamian tradition it was not God, butthe Anunnaki who were responsible for the creation of the first humans."},{"pageContent":"31THE MAKING OF HUMANKINDAs to who the Anunnaki might have been, we shall learn soon enough, and as towhat they were doing in the terrestrial Paradise, the answer is clear—Kharsag,Eden, and Dilmun, as geologist and writer Christian O’Brien suspected, are allone and the same, and in Mesopotamian tradition it was here that the Anunnakiare said to have “made” humankind.One story in particular talks about mythical beings called the Igigi beingburdened with labor by their masters, the Anunnaki, and rebelling, only to bereplaced by human beings.1 [index_split_058.html#filepos1007489] The accountappears in the myth of Atrahasis, the Assyrian flood hero, where we find theIgigi being told to dig a watercourse in a paradise seen in terms of a garden.2[index_split_058.html#filepos1007635] The environment is actually very similarto the setting imagined by Christian O’Brien in his own translation of theNippur foundation cylinder.THE CREATION OF MANAfter “3600 years” of digging out the Tigris and Euphrates river beds to createwater channels, seen as “the lifelines of the land,”3[index_split_058.html#filepos1007880] the Igigi decide they are not going tosuffer this toil any longer and so rebel against the Anunnaki, who are under theleadership of Ellil (the Old Babylonian and Assyrian form of Enlil).4[index_split_058.html#filepos1008038] Apparently, they set fire to their toolsand lay siege to Ekur, Ellil’s mountain house, where the other Anunnaki are alsoto be found. On learning why exactly the Igigi are up in arms, the Anunnakicouncil decides to make the first humans in order to carry out all furthermanual work on behalf of the gods.The humans are created by the Anunnaki through the intervention of “far-sightedEnki” and some of the other Anunnaki.5 [index_split_058.html#filepos1008143] Toachieve this, the god Illawela “who had intelligence” (the god Kingu in otheraccounts) is sacrificed, and the Anunnaki immerse themselves in his blood topurify themselves.6 [index_split_058.html#filepos1008253] Enki then providesclay to the womb goddess Nintu, also called Mami, who calls upon more wombgoddesses to start molding together the blood of the god to create the firsthuman beings “to bear the yoke . . . to bear the load of the gods.” From thegod’s flesh a ghost comes into existence, so that the slain god might never beforgotten.7 [index_split_058.html#filepos1008358]In another version of the Mesopotamian creation myth, the first man is said tohave been Adapa, a name reminiscent of Adam, the first man of Hebrew myth, whois modeled from clay that is the color of blood.8[index_split_058.html#filepos1008468] In this instance it is not only Enki whoprovides clay for the creation of the first humans, but also his wifeNinkharsag, who is synonymous with Nintu and Mami. Together they mold togetherthe blood and clay to create the likeness of the human form.Ninkharsag, we must remember, is one and the same as the wise snake goddess Šir,or Muš, of the Nippur foundation cylinder, meaning that in Mesopotamian myth agoddess identified as a snake is involved in the creation of the first humanbeings. George A. Barton, the original translator of the Nippur foundationcylinder, sensed the biblical connection with this story when he wrote: “She[Muš] was very wise. Her counsels strengthen the wise divinity of Anu [the godof heaven], a statement which reveals a point of view similar to that of Genesis3,”9 [index_split_058.html#filepos1008621] a reference, very clearly, to Eve’srole as the progenitor of humankind in the Genesis story.EVE, THE GIVER OF LIFEStrangely, in Aramaic, the West Semitic language used in the Bible lands duringthe first millennium BC, the word for Eve ([images/00086.jpg], chava or hava) ismore or less identical to the word for snake ([images/00096.jpg]).10[index_split_058.html#filepos1008773] In Arabic also the name Eve, hawwa, means“snake,” although it can also mean “giver of life.” Life, Eve, and the Serpentof Temptation are ultimately bound together, reflections of each other, and ifthis is the case then the fact that Eve bears correspondences with the goddessNinkharsag, Muš, or Šir, the wife of Enki, is significant. Could Eve simply be aHebrew form of this snake goddess who was responsible for the creation ofhumanity, the same way that in biblical tradition Eve is considered to be theFirst Mother of humankind?If so, then it strengthens still further the case for the Mush Plain being theGarden of Eden and Bingöl Mountain being not only Kharsag, and the Duku mound,where the Anunnaki lived and were created, but also the true “place of the gods”in Armenian tradition. Perhaps as both Klaus Schmidt and the current authorsurmise, the Anunnaki are to be seen as the instigators of the Neolithicrevolution, whose memory is immortalized in the T-shaped pillars found in thevarious large enclosures at Göbekli Tepe. As we have seen, there is every chancethat these divine ancestors are a memory of Swiderian groups who entered easternAnatolia sometime during the Younger Dryas mini ice age, ca. 10,900–9600 BC, andwent on to catalyze the Neolithic revolution in the triangle d’or.Yet there remains a stratum of activity concerned with this transformation ofhumanity from simple hunter and forager to animal herder and agriculturallaborer that needs addressing, and this is the memory of the founders ofcivilization contained in the forgotten, fringe, and often heretical literatureof the Judaic world. Here the mythical beings that provide humanity with therudiments of civilization are named as ‘îrîn, “Watchers.” As we see next, theirstory is told in the book of Enoch, one of the strangest yet most compellingholy books ever written."},{"pageContent":"32THE COMING OF THE WATCHERSWhile researching the myths and legends of Bingöl Mountain I became intrigued byits ancient name of Srmantz, or Srmanç, which appears occasionally in oldArmenian texts without explanation.1 [index_split_058.html#filepos1009018] InGreek, I found it written Σερμάντου (Sermantou),2[index_split_058.html#filepos1009247] which I asked writer and journalistJonathan Bright, a colleague from Greece, to investigate on my behalf. Hepossesses a sound understanding of the origins of the Greek language and stood agood chance of identifying the root components behind this curious place-name.Without knowing anything about my findings concerning Bingöl Mountain, he feltcompelled to respond in the following manner:> I cannot avoid noticing the resemblance of the word [Σερμάντου (Sermantou)]> with the Enochian ‘Eρμώμ’ (Sherman-tu/Shermon-/Hermon-/Hermom. . .), where the> 200 watchers have supposedly descended, so although Mt Hermon is identified as> the one standing at the borders between Syria, Lebanon and Israel (Golan> Heights), one cannot help but wonder . . .3> [index_split_058.html#filepos1009529]One cannot help but wonder, indeed. Mount Hermon does indeed feature in“Enochian” texts, such as the enigmatic book of Enoch. This is apseudepigraphical (falsely attributed) work of immense age, the oldest fragmentsof which have been identified among the Dead Sea Scrolls, which in theirearliest form date to the third century BC.One of the book of Enoch’s internal texts, known to scholars as the book of theWatchers, tells the story of the ‘îrîn, a name given to angels in certain Hebrewworks of early manufacture and meaning something like “those who are awake” or“those who watch” (in Greek, [images/00107.jpg]γρήγοροι [egrêgoroi]; in Latinand Slavic, Grigori; and in English, Watchers).*18[index_split_057.html#filepos918709] It is said that two hundred of their numbercame together in an assembly on top of a mountain and swore an oath of loyaltybefore descending to the plains below. Here they took mortal wives and revealedto them the secret arts of heaven. For this they became outcasts, rebels, andreprobates—the first fallen angels, a crime for which they were rounded up,incarcerated by the heavenly angels, and forced to watch the slaughter of theirgiant offspring, the Nephilim, a word that means “those who have fallen” or the“fallen ones.”FIRSTS FOR HUMANITYThe secret arts and sciences of heaven revealed to humanity by the rebelWatchers, as I first noted in From the Ashes of Angels, correspond with a numberof firsts for humanity in the centuries and millennia after the initialNeolithic revolution. This we can see beginning with the construction of GöbekliTepe in the mid-tenth millennium BC and continuing in one form or another acrossthe Near East and Middle East for the next four thousand years.In addition to the earliest expression of animal domestication and agriculture,the earliest use of beaten and smelted metal took place in the Near East, as didthe earliest manufacture of linen fabric, the first brewing of beer andfermenting of wine. Some of the earliest creation of figurines using firedpottery occurred in this region, as did the first known construction of stonebuildings for both secular and religious purposes.This very same epoch saw the first use of stone drills, arguably made of flint,to penetrate large, polished beads made from semiprecious stone, such as quartz,agate, and carnelian, to create beautiful necklaces. At the same time, we findthe first use of green malachite powder for cosmetic purposes. Interestingly,the Watchers were accused of teaching women how to beautify themselves, just asthey are said to have introduced humanity to working with metal,4[index_split_058.html#filepos1009707] something that took place for the firsttime at Çayönü in southeast Anatolia.THE SONS OF GODSo who were the Watchers, and how do they fit into the bigger picture? Biblescholars are convinced that the book of Enoch and other similar examples ofEnochian literature derive from a few brief passages in Genesis 6, which speakof how the bene ha-Elohim, the “Sons of God,” who are synonymous with theWatchers, came upon the “daughters of men” and, finding them fair, lay with themto produce gibborim, “giants,” generally interpreted as alluding to theNephilim. However, this is the original account:> The fallen ones [Nephilim] were in the earth in those days, and even> afterwards when sons of God [bene ha-Elohim] come in unto daughters of men,> and they have borne to them—they [are] the heroes, who, from of old, [are] the> men of name [gibborim]. (Gen. 6:4).Clearly, the Nephilim were actually already existent when the Sons of God, thatis, the Watchers, took mortal wives, and there is good reason to suggest thatthe Watchers and Nephilim are simply different names for the same antediluvianpopulation that thrived in the Bible lands prior to the Flood of Noah. Yet tothink that these meager lines should have inspired the story of the Watchers inthe book of Enoch seems unlikely. More plausible is that it was the other wayaround: the few lines in the book of Genesis are interpolations, laterinsertions, based on quite separate source material, most likely some variationof the Watchers story.After reading the book of Enoch, I became convinced that these Watchers, or“fallen ones,” like the Anunnaki of Sumero-Akkadian tradition, were verypowerful human individuals who lived during some distant age of humankind. Theywere advanced enough to give us the rudiments of civilization, recalled in themanner in which the fallen angels revealed to mortal kind the forbidden arts andsciences of heaven. What is more, their sexual liaisons with the “daughters ofmen” expressed their quite obvious human nature, as well as their ability tococreate in order to produce flesh and blood offspring that resembled boththemselves and their mortal wives.VISAGE LIKE A VIPERYet these rebel Watchers, or fallen angels, bore no recognizable wings. InEnochian literature they are described only as tall in stature, with long, whitehair, pale skin, ruddy complexions, and mesmeric eyes that quite literally shinelike the sun.5 [index_split_058.html#filepos1009869] One crucial passage in afragmentary text known as the Testament of Amram likens the visage of oneWatcher to that of a “viper,” suggesting a long, narrow face of apparentserpentine appearance.6 [index_split_058.html#filepos1010132]At other times, the Nephilim, as the offspring of the Watchers, are calledAwwim, “Serpents,”7 [index_split_058.html#filepos1010331] while in one instancea Nephilim is described as the “son of the serpent named Tabâ’et,”8[index_split_058.html#filepos1010469] with Tabâ’et being one of the rebelWatchers. A Watcher named Gâdreêl is even cited as the serpent that “led astrayEve,”9 [index_split_058.html#filepos1010630] implying that the serpent of Edenwas in fact a Watcher, or fallen angel. More crucially these strange beings areoccasionally described as flying like birds,10[index_split_058.html#filepos1010743] or they are described as wearingiridescent dark cloaks,11 [index_split_058.html#filepos1010935] or garments with“the appearance of feathers”12 [index_split_058.html#filepos1011135] (see figure32.1). Very clearly it suggests the Watchers are in fact quite human shamans, orsome kind of ruling elite, and not simply heavenly beings that have become fleshand blood in order to lie with mortal women.As we have seen, vultures feature heavily in the early Neolithic art of centraland eastern Anatolia, often in humanized form, where they seem to be associatedwith the passage of the soul into the sky world, a path taken also by the shamanafter entering trancelike states. It is likely that to achieve these astraljourneys the shaman put on the paraphernalia of the vulture, like thearticulated wings found at Zawi Chemi Shanidar in the Zagros Mountains ofnorthern Iraq, a site more or less contemporary with Göbekli Tepe.HUMAN ANGELSIs it possible that the memory of how a shamanic or ruling elite seen asresponsible for humanity’s sudden leap forward at the beginning of the Neolithicage has been preserved in Judaic literature as the story of the Watchers andNephilim? Were these fallen angels remembered in Mesopotamian myth as theAnunnaki, the gods of heaven and earth, that “fashioned” the first humans fromblood and clay, and later revealed to us the rudiments of civilization?[images/00118.jpg]Figure 32.1. Left, artist Billie Walker John’s conception of a Watcher based ondescriptions given in Enochian material, and, right, a 3-D sculpt by graphicartist Russell M. Hossain of a Watcher based on Billie Walker John’s 1995illustration.Once again we find that Klaus Schmidt has had something interesting to say onthe subject. Having separately speculated on the myths of the Anunnaki beingsome distant memory of the divine ancestors portrayed as the T-shaped pillars atGöbekli Tepe, in an interview given to the Turkish Times in 2006 he spoke of thestones as representing the “watchman [sic] of the period.”13[index_split_058.html#filepos1011299] Watchmen is simply another form of thename Watcher and actually appears in the book of Enoch (“And I related beforethem all the visions that I had seen in my sleep, and commenced to speak thosewords of justice and to upbraid the watchmen of heaven”14[index_split_058.html#filepos1011871]).Whether Schmidt had in mind the Watchers of the book of Enoch when he said thesewords is not clear; either way, it is an interesting admission and one that doesmake complete sense. For instance, Christian O’Brien, in The Genius of the Few,not only identifies the Anunnaki with the Watchers but concludes that theAnunnaki’s highland settlement of Kharsag was one and the same as the earthlyabode of the Watchers described in the book of Enoch.15[index_split_058.html#filepos1012022] These, it must be said, were incrediblyforward-thinking ideas for 1985, when his book was published, particularly asthe most popular theory at the time was that the Watchers and Anunnaki wereancient astronauts who came here in rocket ships two hundred thousand years agoand created human beings as slave labor to mine South African gold, which wasthen taken off planet.These fanciful notions continue to prosper today. However, at least now we havea realistic alternative that with the discovery of Göbekli Tepe is becomingacceptable even among the academic community, thanks to the very bold stancetaken on the subject by scholars such as Professor Klaus Schmidt. He recognizesthat stories and legends preserved in ancient texts relating to mythical beings,accredited with being the founders of civilization, could well reflect a memoryof the prime movers behind the initiation of the Neolithic revolution.So if the Watchers were, in fact, not heavenly angels but human beings, thenwhere exactly was their earthly abode? Where was the Mountain of Assembly onwhich the two hundred rebels swore allegiance before descending on to the plainsbelow and taking mortal wives? As we shall see next, it was certainly not wherethe book of Enoch tells us, but much farther north in a mythical realm known asthe Land of Darkness."},{"pageContent":"33MOUNTAIN OF THE WATCHERSThere is a general belief that the events portrayed in the book of Enoch, ifthey do have geographical correspondences in the real world, must have occurredin the vicinity of Mount Hermon, where the Watchers are said to have made theirpact before descending on to the plains below. Indeed, some of the place-namesfeatured in the text can be found in the foothills around the mountain, whichlies on the northern border of Israel in the Anti-Lebanon range. There is nodenying that the stories acted out in the book of Enoch are meant to be seen ashaving occurred in the Promised Land of the Israelites, occupied in the wake ofAbraham and his family’s departure from the city of Harran.More likely, however, is that the setting for the events featured in the book ofEnoch was eastern Anatolia, historical Armenia, where almost all the storiescontained in the book of Genesis prior to the age of Abraham are played out. Notonly is it the suspected setting for the fall of Adam and Eve in the Garden ofEden, but it is also where Noah’s ark came to rest; where Abraham was brought upin Ur of the Chaldees (which was most likely Şanlıurfa, and not a city insouthern Iraq, as is generally believed today); where Enoch built the first city(identified with Şanlıurfa—see chapter 34); and where Nimrod, the builder of theTower of Babel, came up against Abraham and was later defeated by the Armeniancultural hero Hayk.All of these biblical characters supposedly lived their lives in thisregion—their shrines and monuments still revered today. So if eastern Turkey isthe geographical setting for the stories of the book of Genesis, then this iswhere we should start looking for the home of the Watchers and Nephilim, and notthe area around Mount Hermon in the Levant.ARMON NOT HERMON?Although such an assumption might seem ludicrous to some, there is confirmationof this surmise in the book of Enoch itself. Whereas in some extant copies MountHermon is cited as the mountain where the rebel Watchers assemble to swearallegiance, in others it is called Armon, which introduces an entirely differentball game. For instance, the translation of the book of Enoch by German scholarAndrew Gottlier Hoffman reads:> Their [i.e., the rebel Watchers’] whole number was two hundred, who descended> in the days of Jared, upon the top of Mount Armon. Therefore they called the> mountain Armon, because they had sworn upon it, and bound themselves by mutual> execrations.1 [index_split_058.html#filepos1012274]Now, it could be argued that Armon is simply a corruption of Hermon, but thiswas not the conclusion of John Baty, who made an English translation ofHoffman’s German language edition of the book of Enoch, published in 1836. Hewas sure that using the name Mount Armon for the Watchers’ Mountain of Assemblyrevealed its true geographical significance, for Armon, the name “the evilangels called that mount . . . in Hebrew signifies both the top of a mountain,and the residence of a famous chief,”2 [index_split_058.html#filepos1012424]adding that “the land of Armenia received its name from Armen, the third of theleaders of the evil angels, who taught the signs of the earth.”3[index_split_058.html#filepos1012554] This, he felt, confirmed the origin of thename, for “the land of Armenia is in Hebrew the land of Ararat, and mount Araratof the Armenians has been clearly shewn to be the mount on which the angelsswore, the top of which was called Armon.”4[index_split_058.html#filepos1012654]MOUNT ARARAT AGAINSo here Baty not only locates Armon in Armenia but identifies it also with MountArarat, the tallest mountain of the region, which, as we have seen, is taken byChristians to be the landing place of Noah’s ark. Yet as outlined in chapter 30,much older traditions, accepted by Babylonian Jews, Muslims, and AssyrianChristians, as well as indigenous Kurds belonging to various ethnoreligiousgroups, identify the ark’s Place of Descent as Mount al-Judi, the modern CudiDağ, near the town of Cizre in southeast Turkey.This absolute conviction in Mount Ararat’s role as the resting place of Noah’sark has allowed it to be identified with all manner of legendary mountainsthought to be located in this region. Any story relating to a nonspecific holymountain in either Northern Mesopotamia or Armenia is automatically assumed torefer to Mount Ararat, simply because it is seen as the sole piece of land thatGod set aside to become the place of renewal of humanity following the recedingof the waters at the time of the Flood. In the eyes of the Christian faith, noother holy mountain even comes close to the religious significance played byMount Ararat in the emergence of humankind.So much did Ararat become a sponge for myths and traditions attached to themountains of Armenia that Abus Mons, or Mount Abus, modern Bingöl Mountain, theacknowledged source of the Euphrates and Araxes rivers, has been assumed to beMount Ararat. This is despite the rather obvious fact that the sources of theEuphrates and Araxes do not take their rise on this mountain. The closest sourceof the Euphrates to Mount Ararat is 50 miles (80 kilometers) away, while theAraxes flows only through its foothills, having taken its course some 150 miles(240 kilometers) to the west on Bingöl Mountain, the true site of Abus Mons.So absurd did this situation become that some maps of Armenia show a mountain inthe approximate geographical position of Bingöl, from which emerge the Euphratesand Araxes rivers. However, instead of its being labeled Bingöl, or even AbusMons, it is named Mount Ararat! (See figure 33.1 on p. 282.) This generalconfusion even led, as late as 1907, to the Araxes being cited as “rising in Mt.Ararat,”5 [index_split_058.html#filepos1012754] when clearly its source is onBingöl Mountain.[images/00126.jpg]Figure 33.1. Section of a map of Armenia by French cartographer Alain ManessonMallet (1630–1706), published in 1683. It misnames Bingöl Mountain, the clearsource of the Euphrates and Araxes rivers, as Mount Ararat.MOUNTAIN-LAND OF THE MINYASBearing all this in mind, Baty’s assertion that the book of Enoch’s Mount Armonhas been ably identified as Mount Ararat is completely groundless. Despite this,he was probably right to link this mythical location, where the Watchers sweartheir allegiance, with Armenia. In the book of Enoch, Armen, the root of thename Armenia, is the name of one of the rebel Watchers. He is said to have“taught the signs of the earth,”6 [index_split_058.html#filepos1012898] thisbeing a form of divination whereby the perturbations of the heavens arereflected also on earth, and vice versa, the rudiments, of course, of astrology.The name of this Watcher derives most probably from another mythical figurenamed Armen, who is considered to be the legendary founder of Armenia. Quitepossibly, the inclusion of Armen’s name in the book of Enoch relates to anArmenian location mentioned by classical writers under the name Armon,7[index_split_058.html#filepos1013048] or Armona,8[index_split_058.html#filepos1013314] a corruption of Har-minni, that is, MountMinni (with variations such as Minyas and Minyadis).9[index_split_058.html#filepos1013590] In this form it is found in the Bible’sbook of Jeremiah, which reads:> > > > Lift ye up an ensign in the land,> > > > Blow a trumpet among nations,> > > > Sanctify against it nations,> > > > Summon against it the kingdoms> > > > of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz.10 [index_split_058.html#filepos1013715]Here the Armenian kingdoms of Ararat and Ashkenaz are clearly separate to thatof Minni, so where exactly was it to be found? English lexicographer WilliamSmith (1813–1893) in his celebrated Bible Dictionary, published in 1884, stateson the matter: “[In the Bible] MINNI only occurs in Jeremiah (51:27). It isprobably identical with the district Minyas, in the upper valley of the Murad-subranch of the Euphrates.”11 [index_split_058.html#filepos1013822]The Murad Şu, or Eastern Euphrates, flows westward through the ArmenianHighlands and gradually turns south below the town of Varto before finallyentering the plain of Mush. This places Minyas, or Minni, in the vicinity of thetown of Varto, immediately south of the Bingöl massif, implying, if correct,that Har-minni, or Mount Minni, was most likely Bingöl Mountain itself.HEAVENLY MOUNTAINGerman theologian Christian Abraham Wahl (1829–1901), whose biblical lexiconswere published in the early nineteenth century, translated the name Har-Minni asmeaning:> “Heavenly Mountain, the mountain whose top reaches to heaven, meaning Ararat;> for mino in Zend, and myno, myny in Parsee, signify heaven, heavenly. And> hence the ancients called the whole province of Ararat, Minyas.”12> [index_split_058.html#filepos1014109]Once again a biblical scholar is beguiled by the magnetic draw of Mount Ararat,for as Jeremiah as well as Latin and Greek scholar William Smith make clear, thekingdom of Minni was not Ararat. Har-minni was thus another mountain, andalthough its exact location cannot be verified with absolute certainly, the factthat Ararat’s main rival Bingöl was once called Mingöl13[index_split_058.html#filepos1014441] seems a little beyond coincidence.Since the Turkish root bin, “a thousand,” coupled with göl, “lake,” providesBingöl’s normal translation of “a thousand lakes” or “a thousand springs,” itmeans that the root min, as in Mingöl, is either a corruption of bin or itrelates to something else. Wahl’s second option seems more likely, as the nameBingöl Dağ is unattested before the writings of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier(1605–1689), a French diamond merchant and traveler who visited the region inthe second half of the seventeenth century.14[index_split_058.html#filepos1014685]Perhaps as the German theologian Christian Wahl proposes, the name Har-minni(i.e., Mingöl) derives from a time when Armenia was under the control of thePersian Empire, which was between the sixth century BC and the time of Alexanderthe Great in the fourth century BC, and again from AD 301 until the sixthcentury AD. Thus the word root min derives most probably from mino, which in thelanguage of the Persian Zoroastrian holy books known as the Avesta means“heaven” or “heavenly.” It is a conclusion supported by the fact that in Persianminú means “azure heaven,”15 [index_split_058.html#filepos1014863] while inHindustani or Urdú, a language that includes many Persian words, míná means“heaven,”16 [index_split_058.html#filepos1015025] while mínú means “paradise.”17[index_split_058.html#filepos1015185] Thus in Persian, Mingöl probably meanssomething like “lake of heaven” or even “waters of paradise.”18[index_split_058.html#filepos1015312]All this tells us very firmly that the mountain named Armon, or Har-mini, uponwhich the rebel Watchers assembled and swore an oath of allegiance beforedescending on to the plain below, was located in Armenia, and not in the Levant,and is most probably Bingöl Mountain, the center of the Armenian obsidian tradeduring the age of Göbekli Tepe (see figure 33.2).THE MOUNTAIN OF GODThere is yet more evidence that the setting for the book of Enoch was theArmenian Highlands and not Mount Hermon in the Anti-Lebanon range. Polish-bornOrientalist and scholar Edward Lipinski (b. 1930), who specializes in biblicaland ancient Near Eastern studies, conducted a major investigation into theorigins of the Mountain of God, the place where the Canaanite god El was said todwell. Even in biblical times, this was deemed to be Mount Hermon, althoughLipinksi found compelling evidence that it was originally located much farthernorth, in the kingdom of Armenia.The first thing that the Belgium-based scholar observed was that the name ofEl’s abode was g‘ r-ll, the “mountain of the night.”19[index_split_058.html#filepos1015513] This is derived from the fact that itsrecesses were “toward the meeting place of the assembly” in the north where thesun never reaches, the Land of Darkness, as viewed from the perspective of thesoutherly placed Mesopotamian Plain, home of the Sumerians, Akkadians, and laterBabylonians and Assyrians.20 [index_split_058.html#filepos1015670] Lipinski wasable to draw parallels between the name of El’s abode and the Sumerian place ofGod known as kur-suh-ha, “the dark mountain,” as well as “the mountain ofdarkness” in the Jewish Talmud, which contains teachings and lore relating tothe contents of the Torah, the first five books of the Old Testament.21[index_split_058.html#filepos1015771] The Talmud speaks also about a placecalled Gehenna, a kind of Jewish underworld, lying “behind the land ofdarkness,” somewhere in the Armenian Highlands.22[index_split_058.html#filepos1015872][images/00131.jpg]Figure 33.2. Section of a map of Armenia by Scottish cartographer John Tomson(ca. 1777–1840), published in Edinburgh in 1814. Here Bingöl Mountain is calledMinguli Dağ, which derives from the Turkish for mountain (dağ ) and the Persianminjul, meaning “lake of heaven” or “waters of paradise.”BENEATH THE POLE STARThis was also where, Lipinski realized, Alexander the Great must have comeseeking immortality in “the land of darkness,”23[index_split_058.html#filepos1015978] which was said to exist “in the north,beneath the Pole Star.”24 [index_split_058.html#filepos1016084] According to thestory, Alexander reached “‘the way of the Armenians’ country, where is thesource of the Euphrates and of the Tigris,’ [here] he entered the wonderland,traversed the land of darkness, proceeded up to the country of the blessed ones,where ‘the sun does not shine,’ and, without knowing it, he reached the springof life,”25 [index_split_058.html#filepos1016292] located, as we have seen, onBingöl Mountain. This story, Lipinski points out, was known as early as thethird century BC, because the Greek philosopher and teacher Teles of Megara inca. 240 BC says that humans want “as Alexander to become immortal.”26[index_split_058.html#filepos1016421]ENOCH IN PARADISEAll this was just a prelude for Lipinski’s investigation of the locationsdescribed in the book of Enoch, for he instantly recognized the same mythicallocations cited here. At the beginning of the story, Enoch journeys to Paradisein the company of two angels, or Watchers, and comes “to a dark place and to amountain, the point of whose summit reached to heaven.”27[index_split_058.html#filepos1016527] Here he saw “the mountains of the darknessof winter and the place whence the waters of the entire deep flow,” and “themouths [i.e., sources] of all the rivers of the earth and the mouth of thedeep.”28 [index_split_058.html#filepos1016653] Additionally, after having“passed above a land of darkness,” Enoch “came next to the Paradise ofrighteousness,”29 [index_split_058.html#filepos1016778] which Lipinski says,“has to be identified with the high mountain of God”30[index_split_058.html#filepos1016907]; that is, the aforementioned abode of El,who is a form of the Hebrew god Yahweh. This “Paradise of righteousness” is, ofcourse, the Garden of Eden or terrestrial Paradise of the Genesis account, forhere, we are told, “the throne of God was fixed where the Tree of Life was.”31[index_split_058.html#filepos1017013]TIGRIS TUNNELFrom this Lipsinki concluded that the entrance to the Land of Darkness, beyondwhich was the Mountain of God, was reached through “a gate of darkness, whosegeographical origin is likely to be looked for in the tunnel at the source ofthe Western Tigris.”32 [index_split_058.html#filepos1017186] This, of course,was the Reverend Marmaduke Carver’s western corner of his proposed terrestrialParadise, its eastern corner being Lake Van, with its apex in the mountain rangethat included Abus Mons; that is, Bingöl Mountain.The Tigris Tunnel, through which the river passes, was originally about a milelong (1.5 kilometers) and ran all the way through the mountain, although todayit has been shortened due to landfalls at its northern end. Yet thousands ofyears ago this mysterious passage, which is in part a deep gorge, was seen as asymbolic gateway from the world of the living to a realm of myth and legend, awonderland, beyond which was Paradise itself.THE MOUNT OF ASSEMBLYIt would be impossible to do full justice to Lipinski’s incredible contributionto this subject (for instance, he shows that the Tigris Tunnel features in theEpic of Gilgamesh as the long tunnel through which the Mesopotamian hero, on hisquest to discover the plant of immortality, passes to reach the Land of the EverLiving, situated in a region of perpetual darkness).33[index_split_058.html#filepos1017315] However, I’ll let him give you hisconclusions on the presence in Armenia of the mountain abode of the god El.Talking about the Old Testament’s book of Isaiah, where the king boldlyproclaims: “Above the stars of El I will exalt my throne, and I will sit downupon the Mount of Assembly, in the recesses of the north (Is. 14:13),” Lipinskiwrites:> The recesses of the north are here the high mountains of Urartu [the Armenian> highlands], where the divine assembly, presided by El, was believed to gather.> . . . In the light of these mythological allusions to the abode of the gods in> the mountains of Armenia, the only explicit mention of El’s abode at the> sources of the Euphrates acquires new dimensions.34> [index_split_058.html#filepos1017426]In other words, as he says himself: “El’s abode . . . is not to be looked fornear Mount Hermon [in the Levant], but midst the mountains of Armenia [currentauthor’s emphasis],”35 [index_split_058.html#filepos1017537] near the sources ofthe Euphrates.BABYLONIAN MAP OF THE WORLDStrengthening the case still further for the Mountain of Assembly of the rebelWatchers existing somewhere in the vicinity of the Armenian Highlands is theoldest known map of the ancient world. Dating from the sixth century BC, it iscontained on a Babylonian clay tablet found during the nineteenth century at theancient city of Sippur in southern Iraq and is currently on display in theBritish Museum (BM 92687).36 [index_split_058.html#filepos1017643] (See figure33.3.)The map shows a large central disk, representing the known world, beyond whichis a circular band labeled mar-ra-tum, which means “ocean,” this being theprimordial waters that were thought to exist beyond the world landmass. Varioustriangles extend from the “ocean,” like the rays of a star, each representing anagû, or “region,” either a mythical realm or distant land. Smaller circlespositioned just inside the perimeter of the disk indicate real geographicallocations as observed from the perspective of Babylon, which is marked as alarge rectangle just above the center of the map.Running through the landmass are parallel lines representing the EuphratesRiver, which begins at the top of the circular landmass within a semicirclelabeled šá-du-ú, meaning “mountain,” a reference to the northerly placed EasternTaurus range. This identification is confirmed by the presence just below and tothe right of the semicircle labeled ur, “city,” next to which is the wordUrartu, the ancient kingdom that embraced territories from the Eastern TaurusMountains north to the Armenian Highlands (the land of Ararat of the Bible) andbeyond to the Caucasus Mountains. Just below this, to the south, is anothersmall circle labeled kuraš+šurki, “Assyria,” which, like Urartu, is correctlyplaced.Yet it is what lies outside of the semicircle marked “Mountain” that is ofinterest here, for the triangle extending away from the primordial ocean bearsthe name BÀG.GU.LA, meaning “great wall,” accompanying which is the legend “6leagues in between where the sun is not seen.”37[index_split_058.html#filepos1017907] Its location, in the north, correspondsperfectly to the direction of Lake Van and the plain of Mush, suggesting thatthe “great wall” is in fact a seemingly impenetrable wall of mountains, eitherthe Armenian Highlands or perhaps even the more northerly Caucasus Mountains,which do indeed form a virtually impenetrable barrier stretching from the BlackSea in the west to the Caspian Sea in the east.That the sun does not shine here shows it to be, as Mesopotamian scholar WayneHorowitz surmises, a “region of perpetual darkness” in the extreme north. LikeLipinski, he thinks it likely this is the same wonderland encountered by thehero Gilgamesh on his journeys and mentioned also in literary traditionsconcerning the travels of the celebrated king of Akkad, Sargon the Great, whoruled ca. 2334–2279 BC.38 [index_split_058.html#filepos1018054] Almost certainlythis distant nagû, or region, was thought to be accessed, as Lipinski alsorealized, through the fabled Tigris Tunnel, which acted as a kind of passage orgateway from the material world in the south to the otherworldly realm ofdarkness existing beyond the Eastern Taurus Mountains. Here was the abode or“throne” of God, the Garden of Righteousness, and the paradisiacal realm visitedby Enoch in the company of angels.[images/00087.jpg]Figure 33.3. Left, Babylonian world map in the form of a clay tablet, now in thepossession of the British Museum (BM 92687), and right, the translation of keyterms used on this map. Note the northerly placed “Mountain,” most likely theEastern Taurus range, beyond which is the nagû, or “region” (triangle shown inblack), labeled “Great Wall,” indicating either the Armenian Highlands or themore northerly Caucasus Mountains. As the legend states, this was “where the sunis not seen”; that is, the Land of Darkness, the location of both the Mountainof Assembly of the Watchers and Kharsag, the mountain home of the Anunnaki gods. GOD’S PROMISED LANDAll this compelling evidence brings us to one powerful conclusion—that theoriginal earthly abode of the Watchers was not Mount Hermon in the Levant, but aplace much farther north, in the Armenian Highlands, with Bingöl Mountain beingthe most obvious candidate. As the Armenian world-mountain, it bore the titleKatar Erkri, “Summit of the Earth,” and was seen as the abode of the gods, whowere most likely the role models for the Anunnaki of Mesopotamian myth andlegend, as well as the Watchers of the book of Enoch.As Greek writer Jonathan Bright intimated in connection with Bingöl’s Armenianname Srmantz, or Srmanç, written in Greek Σερμάάντου (Sermantou), perhaps wehave here the original form of the name Hermon, the Mountain of the Watchers. Itis a surmise strengthened in the knowledge that Srmantz, or Sermantou, which canalso be written Sermantz, is a place-name derived from the Armenian root serm,meaning “seed,” as in the offspring of a progenitor, and the suffix antz, whichmeans either “place of ” or “abounding in.”When applied to Bingöl Mountain, Sermantz reflects its role as a place fromwhich the “seeds” of life sprang forth. Interestingly, the Armenian word serm isconnected with the word root her, or herm, used in the old Armenian language(known as Grabar) to denote the word “father,” through its association withanother word, hayr, or hai’r, which means the root of a hair.*19[index_split_057.html#filepos918897] This word association is crucial, for itbacks up Jonathan Bright’s suggestion that Sermantz reflects the name Hermon,for in Armenian, Hermontz or Hermanz means “place of the father,” or place ofthe progenitor of the seed of life, exactly the same as Sermantz.So both Sermantz and its variation Hermontz not only help explain Bingöl’sclassical name of Abus Mons, which means “Mountain (Latin mons) of the Father(Aramaic and Greek abba),” but they also make better sense of the mountain’smost common Armenian name Biurakn. This, as we saw in chapter 29, means “amillion (bir, byur) eyes (akn),” with “eyes” here meaning sources, mostobviously the countless springs that take their rise on the mountain’s summit.However, Armenian correspondent Gagik Avagyan has informed the author that thereis a much deeper meaning behind the name Biurakn that expresses the idea of themountain being the root, source, or fount of life itself. He says that this samesentiment is conveyed in the mountain’s suspected Persian name, Mingöl, whichmeans “heavenly waters” or the “waters of paradise,” with Paradise or Heavenbeing the source of all life on earth.Apparently, Armenians from all over the country would arrive at Bingöl Mountainevery spring to give thanks to Anahita, the Armenian goddess of fertility, forthe sprouting forth of new seeds (serm) following the harsh winter months. Manyof them would remain camped in its foothills until summer.So in the context of Bingöl’s role as the source of the four rivers of Paradisein Judeo-Christian myth and legend, we can now see that in Armenian traditionthis concept related to the mountain being the place of beginning, the place oforiginal creation, the garden of God himself. He was the “father” who broughtforth the “seed” of all life, which was then, symbolically, carried toward thefour directions by the rivers themselves. How exactly Bingöl gained thiswondrous association is today lost. Most probably it is connected with the factthat the mountain was the center of the region’s obsidian trade during the ageof Göbekli Tepe and that it was from here that the forerunners of the Göbeklibuilders, identified as incoming Swiderian groups, emerged as the ruling elitesometime around 10,500 BC. It was the memory of their deeds that weremythologized into the stories of the Anunnaki—who dwelt in Duku, Kharsag, orDilmun—and the Watchers, the human angels, who descended from Mount Hermon totake mortal wives and reveal the forbidden arts of heaven. That the ArmenianHighlands were also once known as Yerkir Nayiri, “Land of (the) Watchers,”39[index_split_058.html#filepos1018160] supports this theory.Curiously, the name Anunnaki itself might also be of Armenian origin, for in theold Grabar language (which bears some comparisons to Akkadian) its rootcomponents break down as anun, “name”; ak, “root, beginning, river root, seed”;and e, “the,”40 [index_split_058.html#filepos1018335] which when put togethermakes “the name is the beginning,” an allusion most assuredly to the genesis ofthe gods themselves. Yet just what was the role of the Watchers at Göbekli Tepe?Could it really be said that the Watchers, or, indeed, the Anunnaki, areimmortalized in the dozens of anthropomorphic pillars being uncovered theretoday?"},{"pageContent":"34WALKING WITH SERPENTSSo exactly who were the Watchers of the book of Enoch? Their recorded appearanceas being extremely tall, like “trees,” with long white hair, pale skin, ruddycomplexions, eyes that seem to shine like the sun, and visages with theappearance of vipers, conjures a strange creature indeed, and one that has allthe hallmarks of an albino. So were the Watchers albinos? It is a compellingtheory, although there is a far easier explanation.Such distinctive traits might simply be exaggerated descriptions of theSwiderian population, whose suspected presence in eastern Anatolia in theaftermath of the Younger Dryas Boundary impact event might well have catalyzedthe creation of Göbekli Tepe and the later accounts of mythical beings such asthe Watchers and Anunnaki. As we saw in chapter 20, Swiderian communitiescertainly included “tall . . . long-headed, [and] thin faced” individuals,1[index_split_058.html#filepos1018589] while among the post-Swiderian groups ofCentral Russia and the Baltic region were people of increased height withelongated (hyper-dolichocephalic) skulls and narrow faces.2[index_split_058.html#filepos1019039]Additionally, Swiderians would also seem to have carried the distinctivephysiognomy of the Brünn population. They too possessed heads that were long andnarrow, plus they bore traits that marked them as likely Neanderthal-humanhybrids, most obviously prominent brow ridges.3[index_split_058.html#filepos1019207] Similar traits were identified in theSwiderian-linked Kebeliai skull, found in Lithuania in 1948, suggesting thatamong the Swiderian groups entering eastern Anatolia were strange-looking peopleindeed.In fact, the unique physiological features of the Brünn population derived, mostprobably, from prolonged contact with Neanderthal communities, either in CentralEurope or at places like Kostenki and Sungir in Central Russia (the firstsettlement sites at Kostenki go back at least 40,000 years, arguably evenearlier). It is even possible that cross-contact between the different humanspecies began much further away, in the Altai region of Siberia, whereanatomically modern humans shared the world with Neanderthals, as well as othertypes of extinct human types, before their final disappearance sometime aroundthirty to forty thousand years ago.All this tells us that when the Swiderians entered eastern Anatolia theirstriking physical appearance might have contrasted greatly with that of thelocal Epipaleolithic population. Did this lead, eventually, through consistentstorytelling, to gross exaggerations that have made the Watchers into superhumanalbinos the size of trees? If so, then we can understand also how the theSwiderians’ elongated heads led to their being represented not only as abstractstatues with T-shaped heads at Göbekli Tepe but also as human angels withvisages like vipers in myths and legends. Was it a memory that across themillennia became so abstract that eventually they became Awwim, quite literallywalking “serpents”?4 [index_split_058.html#filepos1019365] It is a staggeringpossibility. What is more, compelling evidence now suggests that the peoples ofthe Near East preserved an abstract memory of the existence of a serpent-facedelite for thousands of years after the construction of Göbekli Tepe.THE MYSTERY OF TELL ARPACHIYAHFollowing the Pre-Pottery Neolithic age came the Pottery Neolithic, which ineastern Anatolia and Northern Mesopotamia was represented by the Halaf culture,ca. 6000–5000 BC, and the Ubaid people, ca. 5000–4100 BC, both of whom probablyinfluenced the emergence of the Sumerian and Akkadian civilizations down on theMesopotamia Plain. At a Halaf and later Ubaid site known as Tell Arpachiyah,situated in the Khabur Valley, just outside the city of Mosul in northern Iraq,Max Mallowan and John Cruikshank Rose of the British School of Archaeology inIraq, in the company of writer Agatha Christie, made an amazing discovery. Theyuncovered evidence of an advanced village setting with cobbled streets,rectangular buildings, and round buildings with domed ceilings like the tholoitombs of Mycenaean Greece.5 [index_split_058.html#filepos1019503]Mallowan and his team also unearthed a number of burials, many in poorcondition. Thirteen skulls, however, were better preserved, and these wereexamined by anthropologists Theya Molleson and Stuart Campbell.6[index_split_058.html#filepos1019668] Six were found to be artificiallydeformed, in that they had been deliberately elongated to create an extendedcranium. This must have been done when the individuals were still in theirinfancy using a combination of boards and linen wrappings. These findings hadearlier been predicted by Max Mallowan and fellow archaeologist Hilda Linford,who in 1969 wrote:> We appear to be confronted with long heads, and there are certain pro nounced> facial and other characteristics which . . . would have made them> exceptionally easy to recognize.7 [index_split_058.html#filepos1019836]What seemed important about these deformed skulls is that some of their uniquefeatures were not artificial but natural. In other words, the deformation hadmerely accentuated what was already there. It was a realization that ledMolleson and Campbell to conclude that “several of the individuals (includingsome without deformations) were related to each other,”8[index_split_058.html#filepos1019999] in that they formed part of an extendedcaste, or family group. Moreover, because the site covered the transition phasefrom Halaf to Ubaid, ca. 5200–4500 BC, and the characteristics were present inremains belonging to both cultures, there was evidence of a direct geneticdescent from one culture to the other across an extended period of time.SNAKELIKE HEADSMolleson and Campbell went on to state that this type of deliberate cranialdeformation within a specific group of people “has considerable potential forelitism.”9 [index_split_058.html#filepos1020167] In conclusion, they wrote thathead accentuation among the Halaf and later Ubaid peoples was done to “demarcatea particular elite group, either social or functional,” who were of “closegenetic relationship” and as such were part of a hereditary group that was“closely inbred.”10 [index_split_058.html#filepos1020272]Furthermore, Molleson and Campbell speculated that the “shapes of the head mayhave had some meaning,”11 [index_split_058.html#filepos1020373] adding,incredibly, that these individuals were perhaps recalled in the fired clayfigurines found in various Ubaid cemeteries, which have snakelike heads (seeplate 32 [index_split_031.html#filepos439929]).12[index_split_058.html#filepos1020474] In addition to this, they wrote that anumber of small ceramic heads with elongated cranial features and strangecoffee-bean eyes dating from the Halaf period were also most likelyrepresentations of this elite group (see figure 34.1).13[index_split_058.html#filepos1020585][images/00089.jpg]Figure 34.1. Heads of serpent-like statues from ancient Mesopotamia in theBritish Museum. Their extended heads and coffee-bean eyes indicate that they areabstract representations of the long-headed elite known to have existed amongthe Ubaid and Halaf cultures, ca. 6000–4100 BC.CULT OF THE SNAKESo who exactly were these long-headed individuals, who would seem to have beenmembers of a genetically related group seen as snake-headed in appearance? Thegreatest clue comes not from the ancient world, but from Central America. Amongthe Maya of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, a hereditary line of priests called thechane, or “serpents,” would deliberately deform the heads of their infants togive them what was known as a polcan—an elongated serpent-like head. Doing thismade the child eligible for a hereditary priesthood known as the People of theSerpent, who perpetuated the cult of the rattlesnake.14[index_split_058.html#filepos1020691] They honored Itzamna, or Zamna, a form ofAhau Can, the “Lordly Serpent,” a great wisdom bringer and legendary founder ofthe chane priesthood.Had something similar been occurring at Tell Arpachiyah in northern Iraq—ahereditary group, arguably an elite caste, that deliberately elongated the headsof their children so that when they came of age they were demarked as specialamong the communities in which they moved? Was this done to honor or celebrate adivine ancestor, or a specific group of ancestors, believed to have possessedvery similar serpentine features? Did they represent these divine ancestors assnake-headed figurines of the type found in Ubaid graves?More pertinently, were these human serpents the Watchers of the book of Enoch,who were believed to have had long, serpentlike faces—visages like vipers, asthe Testament of Amram so aptly puts it? Was their memory confused with theenvisaged Fall in the terrestrial Paradise, through the serpent’s temptation ofAdam and Eve? Remember, the book of Enoch tells us that the Watcher namedGâdreêl was the serpent that “led astray Eve.”15[index_split_058.html#filepos1020958]ELITE RITUAL CENTERNo further information is available concerning the genetic background of theskulls found at Tell Arpachiyah, which is now thought to have been an “eliteritual center.”16 [index_split_058.html#filepos1021119] Yet it is worthconsidering whether the elite family group or caste that deformed the heads oftheir children among the Halaf and later Ubaid peoples might not have beendescendants of Swiderian groups who entered eastern Anatolia from the north somefour thousand to five thousand years before the foundation of Tell Arpachiyaharound 5200 BC.Intriguingly, overwhelming evidence indicates that the Halaf culture controlledthe Lake Van and Bingöl obsidian trade,17 [index_split_058.html#filepos1021297]distributing the black volcanic glass throughout the Near East from a series ofcenters in eastern Turkey, northern Syria, and northern Iraq, including TellArpachiyah.18 [index_split_058.html#filepos1021495] In other words, the elitegroup here might have seen itself as the direct successors of the walkingserpents that had controlled the obsidian trade in the distant past. Perhaps theHalaf even saw themselves as their lineal descendants, the reason they chose toaccentuate their cranial features to make their children look more serpentlikein appearance. If this is true, then clearly by this time the European hunters’connections with totems such as the wolf and reindeer had long since beensuperseded by those of the serpent and vulture, two of the most familiarcreatures associated with the beliefs and practices of the Pre-Pottery Neolithicworld (it is interesting to note that in Aztec mythology, the serpent is linkeddirectly with obsidian, and obsidian knives in particular).The strange dark garments or cloaks of feathers worn by the Watchers were mostlikely the ritual paraphernalia of a shaman, arguably one associated with thevulture. This probably led eventually to claims that these individuals were birdpeople19 [index_split_058.html#filepos1021639] or that they bore wings,something that was added to the description of angels as late as the fourthcentury AD.Not only were the book of Enoch’s Watchers seen as walking serpents, but theAnunnaki also were said to have had distinct serpentine qualities. For instance,Christian O’Brien points out that Ninkharsag, the wife of Enlil in the Nippurfoundation cylinder, bears the epithet “Serpent Lady,” while Enlil himself isdescribed as the “Splendid Serpent of the shining eyes.”20[index_split_058.html#filepos1021831] Remember, it is the Anunnaki that KlausSchmidt proposes are perhaps represented by the T-shaped pillars at GöbekliTepe. So are these anthropomorphic pillars representations of the Watchers aswell?CITY OF ENOCHIt would be wrong to identify the long-headed, hood-wearing anthromorphsrepresented by the stone pillars at Göbekli Tepe as actual Watchers, or indeedAnunnaki, simply because both derive from quite separate branches of humandevelopment that reached their zenith many thousands of years after the worldthat emerged in the triangle d’or sometime around the end of the Younger Dryasmini ice age, ca. 9600 BC. Having said this, the indirect connections betweenGöbekli Tepe and these human angels cannot be ignored. For instance, one Syrianchronicler wrote that the city of Şanlıurfa, ancient Edessa, was founded by“Orhay son of Hewya,” the “Serpent,”21 [index_split_058.html#filepos1021998] aclear allusion to the Watchers of the book of Enoch. Remember, Göbekli Tepe isjust 8 miles (13 kilometers) away from the center of Şanlıurfa, where aPre-Pottery Neolithic settlement dating to 9000 BC was investigated in 1997following the discovery in Yeni Yol Street of a life-size human statue withobsidian disks for eyes (see chapter 4).22 [index_split_058.html#filepos1022131]This was discovered in the same area of the city where Nimrod is said to havebuilt his fortress and Abraham was born in a cave, the latter being the reasonthe whole area is considered sacred in Muslim tradition.Strengthening the link between Enoch and Şanlıurfa still further is the factthat Bar Hebraeus (1226–1286), a historical chronicler and bishop of the SyrianChurch, wrote that the prophet Enoch founded the city of Edessa, that is, Urfaor Orfa (even though, in fairness, he attributes the same role to Nimrodelsewhere in his writings).23 [index_split_058.html#filepos1022315] This isinteresting, as Enoch was said to have been visited in his dream-vision by twoWatchers, who took him on a tour of the Seven Heavens, one of which containedthe abode of the angels, while in another was the Garden of Righteousness. As wehave seen, the geographical setting for the patriarch’s amazing journey wouldappear to have been the Eastern Taurus Mountains and Armenian Highlands. So wasEnoch’s place of departure on this great adventure Şanlıurfa?THE PERI AND CINWe should also not forget that the Kurds of eastern Turkey preserve stories andtraditions regarding mythical beings that inhabited this region in prehistorictimes. They are the Peri—tall, strong, beautiful, “super human beings,” whosefay-looking descendants were still thought to inhabit remote mountain villagesas late as the twentieth century. As with the relationship between the Anunnakiand the Igigi, the Peri are said to have worked in concert with other beings ofmythical origin called in Kurdish the Cin; that is, the Jinn of Persianfolklore; the expression “Cin u Peri” being used to express the dual powers ofthese mythical creatures.It was believed that King Solomon made the Cin go to work for him and that they“did what an ordinary human being could not do.”24[index_split_058.html#filepos1022443] Both the Peri and Cin were able to carryheavy objects, build great monuments, and perform other grand feats, and it wasput to me by my Kurdish contact, Hakan Dalkus, who was brought up in a smallvillage in the foothills of the Eastern Taurus Mountains, that “maybe GöbekliTepe was built by them. Or some people then or later believed so. It makes sucha place sacred too. While for us Genies, [that is, Cin] mostly stand for badcharacters to be feared, Peri is the opposite.”25[index_split_058.html#filepos1022621]In his book The Fairy Mythology (revised edition, 1850), celebrated Irishmythologist and historian Thomas Keightley (1789–1872) states that the Jinn, thePersian name for the Cin, “were created and occupied the earth several thousandyears before Adam,”26 [index_split_058.html#filepos1022722] whose death isusually said to have occurred five thousand, five years before the time ofChrist (see chapter 35). So if the Cin or Jinn are in some cases the memory of ahuman culture that thrived in the Armenian Highlands in prehistoric times, thenit suggests they entered the scene around the same time that Swiderian groupsmight well have arrived in the same territories during the Younger Dryas miniice age, ca. 10,900–9600 BC. One of the leaders of the Jinn was Azâzêl,27[index_split_058.html#filepos1022860] a fallen angel, who was also a leader ofthe rebel Watchers, according to the book of Enoch, showing that traditionsregarding the Watchers probably derive from the same origins as those of thePeri and Cin.28 [index_split_058.html#filepos1022961]Clearly, it was not Peri or Cin who built Göbekli Tepe, but human beings.However, there is an outside chance that, in their archaic stories about thePeri and Cin, the Kurds may have preserved the memory of incoming peoples ofstrange appearance who inspired the building of monuments and sacred places. Themanner in which the Peri were able to cohabit with mortal kind is alsoreminiscent of the way the Watchers took mortal wives, who gave birth to giantoffspring that resembled their Watcher fathers in appearance, being large bodiedwith pale and ruddied skin, just like the faylike descendants of the Peri.29[index_split_058.html#filepos1023268]EGYPTIAN INFLUENCE?So were the Nephilim and Sons of God of Genesis 6, along with the Watchers ofthe book of Enoch, really the memory of a Swiderian elite whose originalhomeland included the Carpathian Mountains of Central Europe? It is a persuasivetheory, although we cannot dismiss the possibility that the Hooded Ones weremade up of individuals from more than one ethnological background, with somereaching southeast Anatolia from other parts of the ancient world. We havealready seen how the post-Zarzian peoples of the Eastern Taurus Mountains andZagros Mountains might have provided the expertise to help create cult centerssuch as Hallan Çemi and even Göbekli Tepe, suggesting that the structuresthemselves were in fact the product of indigenous cultures, under the control ofa power elite of Swiderian origin.Yet other cultures from farther afield might also have been involved in thecreation process. For instance, if Nilotic peoples from Egypt, Sudan, and eventhe Sahara were trading with the Natufian peoples, as seems likely from a numberof disparate pieces of evidence now emerging from Epipaleolithic sites in theLevant corridor,*20 [index_split_057.html#filepos919167] then it remainsdistinctly possible that groups or individuals from the Nile Valley might havehad a hand in the emergence of Göbekli Tepe.These are possibilities that cannot be ruled out at this time. Yet what seemsmore certain is that the Swiderians, who would have reached eastern Anatoliaduring the Younger Dryas period, carried with them some semblance of thebeliefs, practices, and ideologies that had earlier thrived among the Solutreanpeoples of southwest and central Europe. They were also, very likely, carriersof magical traditions derived from the Kostenki-Streletskaya culture, whosedescendants they would have encountered as they crossed the Russian steppes ontheir way to the Caucasus Mountains and Armenian Highlands. TheKostenki-Streletskaya peoples’ own successors most probably included theZarzians, who had followed a very similar route as the Swiderians, southwardfrom the Russian steppes to eastern Anatolia, as much as ten thousand yearsearlier. All of these influences are interconnected and came to bear,eventually, on the construction of Göbekli Tepe, ca. 9500–8000 BC.Our journey is almost over. Yet I still needed to make the link between GöbekliTepe and the presence some two hundred miles (320 kilometers) away of the Gardenof Eden. How did one affect the other when they existed in separate millennia,many thousands of years apart? Those living either in biblical times or muchlater during the formative years of Christianity cannot have known of GöbekliTepe, even if they did recognize Armenia as the genesis point of humancivilization. So what linked all these disparate elements together? The answerfor me came with the confirmation of a dream."},{"pageContent":"PART SIXCompletion[images/00125.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"35A QUIET CORNER OF EDENThursday, March 1, 2012. Finally, after nearly eleven months of searching, I hadfound the monastery of my dream, the one in which the monks were celebratinglife itself through the elevation of a holy relic thought to be a fragment ofthe Tree of Life. Called Yeghrdut (or Yeghrduti), the monastery was located 13.5miles (21.5 kilometers) west of the town of Mush, in the foothills of theEastern Taurus Mountains, overlooking the plain of Mush and the Murad Şu, orEastern Euphrates.EDEN-LIKE WOODLANDEvidence of the existence of this monastery, destroyed during the ArmenianGenocide of 1915, had utterly eluded me until now, even though I had consultedample books on the history of Taron, the ancient Armenian kingdom that embracedthe plain of Mush. Yet of all places, it was on Wikipedia that I first foundreference to Yeghrdut. It had its own entry, and under the subheading “Legends,”the following lines almost jumped off the page at me:> According to popular belief, the Kingdom of Armenia has an Eden-like woodland> named Yeghrdut in the Taron district, west of the Muş Valley. It is believed> that old men who come there from Muş valley and spend some time in that corner> of unearthly beauty would become twenty years younger.1> [index_split_058.html#filepos1023545]This “Eden-like” woodland called Yeghrdut, where local men would come to berejuvenated, sounded very much like the claims attached to the Fountain of Life(Ma’ul Hayat) or Waters of Life (Ab’i Hayat), identified in Kurdish folklore asbeing in the vicinity of Bingöl Mountain, 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of thisarea. Was this Armenian account simply an echo of these same legends, or couldYeghrdut relate to the presence in the region of the terrestrial Paradise?Clearly, Eden-like did not mean Eden itself, although I had a hunch there wasfar more going on here.THE DISCIPLE THADDEUSThat day I searched online and found two webpages on Yeghrdut’s history andlegendary background written in Russian-Armenian.2[index_split_058.html#filepos1023806] What they contained simply stunned me andchanged everything I thought I knew about Armenia’s place in the story of theGarden of Eden. Apparently, the fourth-century Armenian churchman Zenob Glak,who wrote a history of Taron, recorded a quite fantastic story regarding theorigins of the Yeghrdut monastery. It begins with the well-established accountof how in AD 29 Thaddeus, one of the seventy (or seventy-two) disciples ofChrist, traveled to the city of Edessa (modern Şanlıurfa) in NorthernMesopotamia at the behest of its king, Abgar, who wished to be cured of aserious skin malady.According to early Christian legend, the king, having heard of miracles beingperformed by Jesus, sent out a request for this wonder worker to cure him of hisillness. In response, the disciple Thomas dispatched Thaddeus of Edessa, who hadearlier traveled from his homeland in Northern Mesopotamia to Judea, where he’dbeen baptized by John the Baptist in the River Jordan, and then, following theBaptist’s death at the hands of King Herod, had become a follower of Jesus.So when Jesus was still alive, according to the story, Thaddeus (also known asAddai) arrived in Edessa, his native city, carrying with him a handkerchief thatJesus is alleged to have wiped across his face, leaving behind a facelikeimpression. It was the power of this holy relic, known as the Image of Edessa,or the Mandylion, that is said to have cured Abgar of his malady.The account goes on to state that Thaddeus afterward baptized King Abgar, whothus became the first monarch to adopt the Christian faith. As for Thaddeus, heapparently remained in Northern Mesopotamia preaching the word of God, and thenin either AD 43 or AD 45 entered the neighboring kingdom of Armenia. Here hecame upon a “woodland” called Yeghrdut, where he deposited a number of highlysignificant holy relics brought out of the Holy Land. Other variations of thistradition have Thaddeus being accompanied on his journey by the apostleBartholomew.3 [index_split_058.html#filepos1023998]Fast forward to the fourth century, and the writer Zenob Glak now has thecelebrated Armenian churchman Gregory the Illuminator being led by God toretrieve the holy relics left behind by Thaddeus three centuries earlier.Thereafter a monastery is founded on the spot in order to house them.4[index_split_058.html#filepos1024163]The relics found by Gregory at Yeghrdut apparently included a small finger ofMary Magdalene, items belonging to Joseph of Arimathea, and bones from the rightarm of John the Baptist,5 [index_split_058.html#filepos1024693] hence themonastery’s dedication to the saint.6 [index_split_058.html#filepos1024793]Gregory also discovered a bottle, or container (Armenian shish), in which waspreserved a remnant of the perfumed oil (known as the Myron, Muron, or Chrism)that had anointed “prophets and apostles”7 [index_split_058.html#filepos1024893]and had been used by Thaddeus to help restore King Abgar’s health and vitalityfollowing his miracle cure after coming into contact with the Image of Edessa.For this reason the monastery bore the alternative name of Shishyugho, whichmeans “of the oil bottle,”8 [index_split_058.html#filepos1025228] or Shuyugho,“young branch of the (oil) tree.”9 [index_split_058.html#filepos1025449]EDEN AND THE TREE OF LIFEIn Christian tradition such relics, if considered “genuine,” would be deemedhighly significant. However, for me they paled into insignificance when comparedwith what else Thaddeus supposedly deposited at Yeghrdut, for according toArmenian tradition he came bearing a fragment of the “Tree of Life” (Armenian[images/00091.jpg]), which after its discovery became a key focus of venerationat the monastery.10 [index_split_058.html#filepos1025610]More incredibly, I discovered that Yeghrdut was believed to have been locatednot just in an “Eden-like woodland,” but in “a corner” or “one corner” of “Eden”(Armenian [images/00093.jpg]), which can also mean the “Garden of Eden.” This,the Armenian source states, “was in Taron Province, south of the Mush plain(Armenian [images/00095.jpg]).” It goes on to say that “The place was calledYeghrdut, and here the elderly man would travel to become younger by twentyyears.”11 [index_split_058.html#filepos1025902]As soon as I read these words, my stomach churned, and I knew inside that thiswas the monastery I had glimpsed in dream the previous year. Both the referenceto the presence there of a piece of the Tree of Life and the monks’ belief thattheir monastery stood in some quiet corner of the Garden of Eden seemed toconfirm this fact. It was the same place I’d seen, smelt, and experienced, bothin sleep and then afterward when recording my thoughts in diary form.Yet double-checking what exactly a fragment of the Tree of Life actually meansin Armenian Church tradition made me realize that the holy relic at Yeghrdut wasslightly more complicated than I had first imagined, for it is also described asthe “Stick of Life” (Armenian [images/00097.jpg]),12[index_split_058.html#filepos1026124] or a “piece of the Wood or Timber of (theTree of) Life (Armenian [images/00099.jpg][images/00101.jpg]).”13[index_split_058.html#filepos1026272] It is a term that derives from a graduallyevolving legend that has its inception in the first century AD and revolvesaround what happened to Adam and Eve following their expulsion from Paradise.After departing the Garden of Eden, the couple settle down somewhere on itsfringes, and here they raise two sons, Cain, a crop grower, and Abel, ashepherd. As the book of Genesis tells us, Cain kills Abel, creating the firstmurder and death in human history. As a consequence, Cain is cast out and livesthe rest of his life in the enigmatically named land of Nod, while Adam andEve’s third son, Seth, is born. He becomes Adam’s rightful successor and theinheritor of his heavenly wisdom and knowledge.THE OIL OF MERCYSo far, this is the basic story in the book of Genesis. However, Jewish andlater Christian works compiled between the third century AD and medievaltimes—containing what scholars refer to as Primary Adam Literature—continuewhere the Bible account leaves off. The most well-known of these are the LatinVita Adae et Evae (“Life of Adam and Eve”) and the Greek Apocalypsis Mosis(“Apocalypse or Revelation of Moses”). Both these texts, and others like them,relate the story of how when Adam was on his deathbed he asks his son Seth toapproach the gates of Paradise and beseech God to part with a little of the “Oilof Mercy” that flows from the Tree of Life, in order that this might sustain hislife. Obeying his father, Seth departs for Paradise in the company of Eve andimplores God to give him some of the oil from the “tree of his mercy” in orderthat he might anoint his sick father (see figure 35.1).After some time, an angel appears (usually this is Michael, although notalways). He refuses their request, saying that the Oil of Mercy is reserved forthe final days, adding that in five and a half thousand years a savior will comewho will be baptized in the River Jordan. Thereafter he will “anoint from theoil of mercy all that believe in Him. And the oil of mercy shall be forgeneration to generation for those who are ready to be born again of water andthe Holy Spirit to life eternal. Then the most beloved Son of God, Christ,descending on earth shall lead thy father Adam to Paradise to the tree ofmercy”14 [index_split_058.html#filepos1026400]; that is, the Tree of Life (seefigure 35.2).HOLY ANOINTING OILIn other words, the text prophesized that, following his baptism in the RiverJordan at the hands of John the Baptist, Jesus would somehow become the vesselof the Oil of Mercy, which would be spread by the Holy Spirit. The ArmenianChurch believes that this power was given originally to Moses, who wasinstructed by God to make something called the holy anointing oil (Ex.30:22–33). This was afterward used to anoint many generations of Old Testamentprophets, and eventually it found its way into the hands of John the Baptist.Following his death it was given to Mary Magdalene, who used it to anointJesus’s feet before his entry into Jerusalem prior to his arrest andcrucifixion. He is said to have blessed it, after which time the oil was used toanoint apostles. Thaddeus of Edessa then carried the oil’s container to Edessa,where the anointing oil was used to restore King Abgar’s health and vitality.Thereafter the disciple continued his journey and buried the shish bottle “inDaron under an evergreen tree.”15 [index_split_058.html#filepos1026671]The “Daron” mentioned here is an alternative rendering of “Taron,” the plain ofMush, with the location of the “evergreen tree” being Yeghrdut (the Tree of Lifewas anciently considered to be an olive tree, which is an evergreen16[index_split_058.html#filepos1026942]). There is nothing about Jesus anointingthe apostles in the New Testament—this is considered to have been bestowed onall 120 disciples of Christ by the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost inJerusalem.17 [index_split_058.html#filepos1027405] However, the Yeghrdut legendstates that the holy anointing oil deposited there by Thaddeus had been used toanoint “prophets and apostles.”18 [index_split_058.html#filepos1027581][images/00103.jpg]Figure 35.1.

American lithograph ofthe Tree of Life in the terrestrial Paradise by the Currier and Ives company(1857–1907).THE ANGEL’S GIFTIn the story contained in the Latin Vita Adae et Evae, composed sometime betweenthe third and seventh century using earlier source material, Seth and Eve departfrom the Garden empty-handed. However, in alternative, and arguably later,accounts the angel gives Seth seeds or saplings from the Tree of Life to takeaway with him.19 [index_split_058.html#filepos1027920] He and Eve then return toAdam, revealing what the angel said and what has been given to them. ThereafterAdam dies, and his body is laid to rest with the help of angels.Prior to Adam’s final interment, Eve and Seth place the seeds from the Tree ofLife in his mouth, or alternatively, they plant the saplings over the positionof Adam’s skull (the accounts vary). These grow into either a single tree orthree trees that wrap around each other to become one. Eventually the tree iscut down and the timber utilized for a number of quite fantastic purposes. It isused to fashion the rod of Moses. It becomes a beam in King Solomon’s Temple, orit is used to make a bridge, over which the Queen of Sheba passes. As thishappens, she realizes the sanctity of the wood and demands that it be taken upand placed inside Solomon’s Temple as a sacred relic.THE TRUE AND LIVING CROSSAfterward, the Holy Wood, or Holy Timber, of Life, as it is called in theWestern Church, finds its way into a carpenter’s shop, where it is used tofashion the Cross of Calvary, known in medieval tradition as the Holy Rood.After Christ’s crucifixion on Golgotha, the cross is buried nearby. Here also isAdam’s skull, concealed during a much earlier age either by Shem, Noah’s son andheir, and/or by Melchizedek, the first king of Salem; that is, Jerusalem. Theblood trickling down the cross from Christ’s body reaches Adam’s skull, finallybringing redemption to Adam for causing the original sin. The symbolism betweenthe burial of Adam’s skull and Golgotha, which means the Place of the Skull, ispurposeful. It is for this reason that we see a skull at the foot of the crossin Crucifixion scenes, and also on crucifixes.Accordingly, the elderly Empress Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, thefirst Roman emperor to adopt and legalize Christianity, visits Jerusalem in AD327 or AD 328 and is led by miraculous means to discover the remains of theCross of Calvary beneath a Roman temple of Venus now occupying Golgotha Hill. Asfragments of the holy cross are found to constantly sprout forth new greenshoots (due to the wood originating from the earthly Tree of Life), it becomesknown as the True and Living Cross. It is because of this regenerative powerthat fragments of the True Cross are thought to have the power to restore lifein a sickly person.Clearly, the fragment of the Tree of Life possessed by the Yeghrdut monasterymust have come from a separate branch to the one used to create the Cross ofCalvary, as this piece is said to have reached Armenia in either AD 43 or AD 45,a mere decade after the Crucifixion and nearly three centuries before theEmpress Helena discovered the Cross of Calvary. The only other thing I coulddiscover was that Yeghrdut’s precious holy relic was kept in a reliquary box(see chapter 39) and, I could only assume, was brought out and elevated duringspecial ceremonies in the absolute conviction that here was a true fragment ofthe Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden.Yet there was more to this story than simply the existence at Yeghrdut of theTree of Life fragment and the vessel containing the holy anointing oil, forafter the foundation of the monastery in the fourth century, the monks wouldmanufacture their own Myron, or holy anointing oil, always mixing it in thebottle that had contained the original oil created by Moses. This was done sothat the new anointing oil would forever contain the essence of the originalholy anointing oil used to bless “prophets and apostles.” Apparently, Yeghrdut’ssacred oil would be transported to the Mother See of Holy Echmiadzin inVagharshapat, Armenia, where it was used in the inauguration of the Catholicos,the head of the Armenian Church.20 [index_split_058.html#filepos1028179]Naturally, I wanted to know more about Yeghrdut and its monks who, I felt sure,played heavily on their illustrious heritage and location on the edge of Edenitself. It was incredible to think that this monastery had thrived in thefoothills of the Eastern Taurus Mountains just 170 miles (274 kilometers) awayfrom Göbekli Tepe, a true site of the genesis of civilization.Yet what was Yeghrdut’s connection with Göbekli Tepe, and, more pressingly,where was this monastery? It did not appear on any detailed maps of Taron, andunless its location was found, there could be no absolute confirmation that thiswas the place of my dream."},{"pageContent":"36THE RED CHURCHIneeded to know where exactly the Yeghrdut monastery was located, so I attemptedto use the geographic coordinates provided by Wikipedia to find the site. Yetwherever engineer Rodney Hale and I looked on Google Earth, nothing could beseen (the coordinates were later found to be wrong). All I knew was thatYeghrdut lay somewhere in the vicinity of a village called Kızılağaç (orKızılhaç, pronounced kiz-a-large), a part Turkish, part Kurdish name meaning“red cross,” a sure sign that a Christian edifice lay nearby.The break came at the end of March 2012, when I learned from my Kurdish contact,Hakan Dalkus, who had managed to contact the person running the KızılağaçFacebook page, that in nearby mountains were Armenian ruins called Dera Sor,Kurdish for “Red Church.” It took further three-way correspondence to pin downthe geographical location of Dera Sor. Then on Friday, April 6, 2012,appropriately Good Friday in the Western calendar, I saw for the first time onGoogle Earth an enormous rectilinear structure on a forested mountain ledge 2.25miles (3.6 kilometers) south-southeast of Kızılağaç and 1.5 miles (2.5kilometers) west-southwest of the village of Suluca (located at the coordinatesof 38°45'1.37\"N, 41°20'24.69\"E).The ruins appeared to consist of an outer shell around 70 yards (64 meters) inlength and just over 40 yards (37 meters) in width. From what I could make outfrom the shadows cast by the remaining sections of the wall, they remainedfairly high in places. The foundation of a second structure in the southeastquadrant of the perimeter wall was also just visible, its axis skewed slightlymore toward north (see figure 36.1).[images/00106.jpg]Figure 36.1. Google Earth image of Dera Sor, located on the northern slopes ofthe Eastern Taurus Mountains, overlooking the Mush Plain. Does it mark the siteof the Garden of Eden? Courtesy of DigitalGlobe 2013.Immediately outside Dera Sor’s exterior walls were traces of other rectilinearfeatures, showing that this had to have been a monastery of some considerablesize, situated in the northern foothills of the Eastern Taurus Mountains,overlooking the plain of Mush and Murad Şu or Eastern Euphrates River. Lookingat the site, I got a strong sense of seclusion, isolation, and deliberateremoteness. Unlike monasteries such as Surb Karapet and Surb Arakelots elsewherein the Mush district, this one cannot have received many visitors, unless it wasfor a very good reason indeed.Although I was able to confirm that the Google Earth ruins were those of DeraSor, the Red Church, I had no way of knowing whether they belonged to theYeghrdut monastery. Further correspondence between my Kurdish contact and theman from Kızılağaç drew a complete blank. No one seemed to know anything aboutYeghrdut or its history.I tried synching the geographical position of the Red Church with some old mapsof Armenia, one of which had the word “Arkhavank,” meaning “King’s Monastery”(probably a reference to Jesus as King of the Jews), in the approximate sameposition, while another actually had a small diamond marking the position ofYeghrdut. They correlated pretty well, suggesting that Dera Sor, Arkhavank, andYeghrdut were all one and the same.STRANGE DECREESomething else pretty curious was then discovered about Yeghrdut by a researchercolleague named Janet Morris. On my behalf, she had been studying and, wherenecessary, translating accounts of European travelers who had crossed the plainof Mush over the past four hundred years. One such person, she found, was theFrench geographer Vital-Casimir Cuinet (1833–1896), who was sent to easternTurkey to survey and count the Ottoman Armenian population. He made a verycurious statement following a visit to the Yeghrdut monastery:> On the opposite side of the plain, at the summit of a picturesque hill,> covered with a thick wood and whose view extends a long way over an agreeable> country, is found a convent under the decollation of St John the Baptist. Its> construction as that of Mar-Johanna goes back to high antiquity. Amongst other> precious titles, this convent holds a firman of the fourth Caliph Rachedi,> Ali, son-in-law and first cousin of Mohammed, who accorded certain autonomous> privileges falling into disuse over the course of time.1> [index_split_058.html#filepos1028474]That Ali (AD 601–661), the son-in-law and cousin of the Prophet Muhammad, seenas the first imam in the Shia Muslim faith, signed a firman, or religiousdecree, on behalf of Yeghrdut begs the question of what might have been behindthis decision. Clearly, Ali cannot have spent his time issuing and signingreligious decrees for every Christian edifice the Arab armies came across asthey conquered large parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe, so why was thismonastery singled out for special attention?In the year 15 AH (anno Hegirae; i.e., after the foundation point of the Islamicfaith, thus AD 637), the Commander of the Faithful, Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab,issued a written decree acknowledging the due rights of all non-Muslim sects,including Christians. This was done to protect churches and monasteries ingeneral. Yet the one issued for Yeghrdut seems entirely different and suggeststhat, like Saint Catherine’s Monastery in the Sinai, which was issued a firmanby Muhammad himself, it was believed to contain important holy relics. Somebodywanted whatever it contained preserved and not destroyed by the first marauderswho came along looking for the spoils of battle. It hinted that Yeghrdut’s claimto house holy relics belonging to Jesus, Mary Magdalene, John the Baptist, andJoseph of Arimathea was known at the time of the Arab-Muslim invasion of Armeniain the seventh century. (Much later I discovered a second reference toYeghrdut’s firman, which states that it was signed not just by Ali, but also bythe Prophet Muhammad himself.2 [index_split_058.html#filepos1028634] If nothingelse, it tells us that Yeghrdut once held a religious status equal to that ofSaint Catherine’s monastery in the Sinai, which makes it a highly importantplace indeed.)ONLINE APPEALI was getting frustrated. I really needed to know whether Dera Sor, the RedChurch, was Yeghrdut, the Eden monastery of my dream, so I posted a message onan online forum called AniOnline that addresses matters relating to Armenianarchitecture in the Lake Van area. I asked for confirmation of the monastery’sexact geographical coordinates and anything else anyone might come up with,citing exactly what I knew already.3 [index_split_058.html#filepos1028809]As I waited for a response, my Kurdish correspondent, Hakan, returned with moreinformation on Dera Sor from the Facebook contact in Kızılağaç:> It is easy to reach the Red Church from Suluca and Kızılağaç. Walls and two> arches stand. . . . They say Red Church was a monastery. Monks, priests and> sisters etc. were educated there. It was a very rich monastery. Farmers of the> surrounding lands were giving 50 percent of their crops to the monastery. No> other info.4 [index_split_058.html#filepos1029206]A few days later, Raffi Kojian, the mediator of the AniOnline forum, posted afew lines on the Yeghrdut monastery paraphrased from a Russian-Armeniandictionary of Armenian architecture:> From the monastery the following were visible: Aradzani and Meghraget [both> rivers], S. Karapet Monastery, a few villages [and mountains, viz.], Byurakn> [Bingöl], Nemrut [Dağ], Gurgur, Sipan [Suphan Dağ], and in the further> distance, the gray top of Massis [Mount Ararat]. That last one seems like a> stretch, but that’s what it says.5 [index_split_058.html#filepos1029380]Rodney Hale used Google Earth to check whether each mountain peak—Bingöl Dağ,Nemrut Dağ, Suphan Dağ, and Agri Dağ (Mount Ararat or Mount Massis)—was indeedvisible from Dera Sor. Sure enough, if one were to stand on the mountain ridgeimmediately above the monastery ruins, all the peaks mentioned would have beenvisible on a particularly fine day.Two days later, Raffi Kojian again posted on his forum. He said he now had inhis possession a lengthy entry on Yeghrdut taken from a Russian-Armenianencyclopedia on the churches and monasteries of the Taron Province, published in1953. He had uploaded the opening lines to the Yeghrdut webpage on Armeniapedia,the online database for Armenian church architecture, which were now availableto read.6 [index_split_058.html#filepos1029721] Clicking the link, I found thefollowing:> Located four to five hours west of Mush, in front of S. Garabed/Karapet> Monastery, in “Yegherits” region (yergir), on Sim Mountain (Sim ler) or on> Black Mountain (Sev sar), on the south side of Yeprad/Yeprat River [i.e., the> Murad Şu or Eastern Euphrates]. The location of the monastery is unmatched. On> four sides are cold springs and forest. The air is pure, but cold. The view is> indescribable. Almost all of Mush’s plain is flat like a floor, its green> worked fields open up before your eyes.7 [index_split_058.html#filepos1030017]This place sounded incredible, situated at a near perfect location to perpetuatethe belief that it was founded in some quiet corner of Eden itself. I laterdiscovered that four springs surrounded the monastery, one on each side, beyondwhich lay forests containing oak, hazel, and cedar trees.8[index_split_058.html#filepos1030182]HOLY TREE AND SACRED SPRINGThe contact at Kızılağaç was shown this entry on Yeghrdut and confirmed thatthis was indeed the topographical description of Dera Sor, adding that onespring in particular flowed from beneath the shade of an ancient walnut tree.Indeed, there was no other tree quite like it in the whole of Mush Province(walnut trees are considered sacred in Kurdish tradition). People came here fromall over the district to drink the waters of the spring in the belief that itcould cure ailments and maladies, and rejuvenate the body by as much as twentyyears.9 [index_split_058.html#filepos1030282] This was, it seemed, the latestincarnation of the “evergreen tree” beneath which Thaddeus supposedly depositedthe various holy relics in the first century AD.Clearly this was an important holy shrine and one that was venerated extensivelyin the past by Christians and Muslim Kurds alike. It almost seemed as if, withthe presence at Yeghrdut of a piece of the Tree of Life, together with thebottle that contained the sacred Myron, or holy anointing oil, the monks mighthave seen this evergreen tree and sacred spring as earthly representations ofthe Tree of Life with its spring that watered the Garden of Eden. Indeed, thestream that takes its rise from the spring beneath the monastery’s holy tree,which bears the name Kilise Şu, “Church Stream,” flows into the EasternEuphrates, making it a source of one of the four rivers of Paradise.DERA SOR IS YEGHRDUT!That same day, Thursday, April 12, 2012, a member of the AniOnline forum postedthe geographical coordinates of Yeghrdut, which were those of Dera Sor, the RedChurch. The two were the same. The person in question said he had walked thehills from Mush to the location and could confirm that it is identical to thetopographical description of Yeghrdut. In response, Raffi, the mediator of theforum, added a Google Earth link to Yeghrdut’s entry on Armeniapedia, which nowclicked through to the site of Dera Sor.10 [index_split_058.html#filepos1030562]There could no longer be any doubt—Dera Sor was Yeghrdut, which for me nowbecame the absolute site of the Eden monastery first glimpsed in dream almostexactly one year earlier. To say I was elated is an understatement, for italmost seemed as if something I had created in my mind had now taken root inreality. Yeghrdut was certainly real, and with its fragment of the Tree of Life,the bottle containing the holy Myron, the “evergreen tree” with its sacredspring, and, of course, its “indescribable” setting, it was everything one couldhope for in a monastery located in Paradise itself. Yet still more research wasrequired to truly understand the site’s greater importance to this graduallyemerging picture.SIM MOUNTAINSomething in the opening lines of the Yeghrdut entry in the Russian-Armenianencyclopedia on churches and monasteries of the Taron Province then caught myattention. It was the statement regarding the monastery being located on SimMountain (Sim ler) or Black Mountain (Sev sar). The latter is a quite commonname for hills and mountains in the region, usually under the Turkish word forblack, which is kara. However, Sim Mountain needed further investigation, as itseemed somehow familiar. So I checked the history and topography of Taron andfound something very interesting indeed.Movses Khorenatsi, the father of Armenian history, who lived in the fifthcentury AD, wrote extensively on the region’s mythological past, in particularthe life and exploits of Armenian cultural heroes thought to be descended fromNoah (Armenians themselves believe they are descended from Noah11[index_split_058.html#filepos1030859]). For instance, Hayk, the conqueror ofKing Bel, or Nimrod, is said to have been the great-great-great grandson ofJapheth, the son of Noah. Shem, Noah’s chosen heir, is also connected withArmenia’s legends, and according to Movses, after the ark came to rest, Shemdeparted with his sons and came upon a mountain, which he afterward named Sim(or Simsar, which means Mount Sim).12 [index_split_058.html#filepos1031221]According to Movses, Noah, having departed from the ark, established a dwellingfor himself and his family (afterward named Thamanin, the modern Cizre insoutheast Turkey), while Shem continued northwestward with his sons, and that> coming to a plain in the high mountains, he stopped by a river and named the> mountain Sim after his own name. He gave this region to his youngest son> Tarpan [the Armenian word for ark is Tapan]. . . . Tarpan remained with his> sons and daughters in the region given to him by his father and called it> Taron and later Taruperan after his own name.13> [index_split_058.html#filepos1031365]Taron, or Taruperan, was, as we have already seen, the name of an ancientArmenian kingdom embracing the plain of Mush, implying, quite clearly, thatMount Sim overlooked the plain, which, of course, it does. Thus Yeghrdut wasfounded either on or very close to the spot where Shem and his sons are supposedto have set up camp after leaving the ark. As Movses Khorenatsi’s home villagewas nearby Chorene, immediately south of Yeghrdut, it seems unlikely that themonks of the monastery would not have been aware of this clearly local traditionfeaturing Shem, the son of Noah.Movses Khorenatsi’s geographical positioning of Mount Sim and the wanderings ofNoah and his family also make it clear that Mount Ararat is not the Place ofDescent, the site where Noah’s ark came to rest after the Flood. Shem is said tohave traveled “northwest” to reach Sim Mountain in the kingdom of Taron (seefigure 36.2), which fits perfectly with the ancient belief that the ark wentaground on Mount al-Judi, the modern Cudi Dağ in southeast Turkey. In otherwords, the story as preserved in Movses’s fifth-century history of Armenia waswritten with Mount al-Judi in mind as the Place of Descent, and not MountArarat, which lies some distance to the east-northeast of Sim Mountain.[images/00108.jpg]Figure 36.2. Map of eastern Turkey showing the candidates for the Place ofDescent in Noahic tradition. Note also the route taken by Noah’s son Shem fromthe Place of Descent to Sim Mountain, said to overlook the kingdom of Taron,that is, the plain of Mush.All these Armenian traditions indicate that the plain of Mush and thesurrounding mountain ranges were seen as important to the events portrayed inthe generations between Adam and Abraham, although what they did not do was givecredence to the belief that here also was the terrestrial Paradise. What Ineeded was better confirmation that Armenia, and in particular the area underdiscussion, was once believed to have been the site of Eden, something thatMovses Khorenatsi worryingly makes no mention of in his history of Armenia.As we see next, that confirmation is provided by the Reverend Marmaduke Carver,who in his fabulous work A Discourse of the Terrestrial Paradise, published in1666, did so much to show that the area between Thospites Lake (Lake Van), theTigris Tunnel in Sophene, and Bingöl Mountain in the Armenian Highlands was thetrue site of the terrestrial Paradise."},{"pageContent":"37THE SECRETS OF ADAMThe Reverend Marmaduke Carver wished also to find absolute confirmation that thesouthern part of Armenia Major, modern eastern Turkey, was the authentic site ofthe Garden of Eden. Writing in A Discourse of the Terrestrial Paradise, henotes: “Tradition successfully continued in these parts [i.e., after the Flood],that hereabout was the place of Adam’s Paradise,”1[index_split_058.html#filepos1031714] adding:> The Author that affirms this is Methodius. . . . Now this ancient Author (in> lib. Revel.) speaking of the death of Seth, and the secession of his posterity> from the posterity of Cain, hath among other things this remarkable passage:> Mortuo Seth separavit se Cognatio ejus à sobole Caini, redierúntque ad natale> solum. Nam & Pater corum vivens prohibuerat nè miscerentur.

And Seth lived with his kin on Mount Cordan, next to theterrestrial Paradise.”Having cited Methodius’s words, Carver notes: “If the terrestrial paradise werenear the Mount Cordan, and that Mount Cordan or Gordiæus stood in the same placewhere Ptolemy hath set it; then we may rest secured, that the happy seat of ourFirst Parents Habitation was at or about the very place that we havedescribed.”3 [index_split_058.html#filepos1031976]THE REVELATIONS OF METHODIUSVery pertinent words indeed, so who was Methodius and where was Mount Cordan, orGordiæus? Methodius of Olympus was a theologian and prolific writer of the earlyfourth century (he died ca. AD 311). The quotation cited by Carver, orvariations of it, is from a work accredited to Methodius entitled the Apocalypseor Revelations (Revelatio). It contains a commentary on the book of Genesis andan account of the coming of the Antichrist and the inevitable end of the world.However, there is a problem, as there is no record of Methodius ever havingwritten such a book. Moreover, it is quite clear from its contents that theApocalypse was written in response to the Arab invasion of Asia Minor in thesecond half of the seventh century AD, three hundred years after Methodius’sdeath. In other words, its author was most likely a Christian writer of theseventh century who wanted to bolster the tract’s value by accrediting it toMethodius.Exactly who penned this pseudepigraphical, or falsely attributed, work isunclear (the author is now referred to as Pseudo-Methodius), although what isimportant is that it was written originally in Syriac, the language of NorthernMesopotamia, meaning that it could well have originated from somewhere close tothe city of Edessa, modern Şanlıurfa. This seems certain, as just a year or twoafter its initial circulation, modified versions, known today as the EdesseneApocalypse, were being produced in the area, quite possibly in one of themonasteries locally.4 [index_split_058.html#filepos1032082]WHERE IS CORDAN MONTE?Which version of the Apocalypse the Reverend Marmaduke Carver consulted for hisbook is not cited. Most likely it was a volume in the York Minster Library,where the churchman did much of his research for A Discourse of the TerrestrialParadise. Yet if we accept Carver’s translation as authentic (and I havecertainly found a Latin version of the Apocalypse with a date of 1593 thatcontains these exact same lines5 [index_split_058.html#filepos1032258]), itimplies that in the late seventh century an accomplished theological writer,living close to Edessa and the site of Göbekli Tepe, possessed knowledgeimplying that Seth, his father Adam, his mother Eve, and their extended familygroup inhabited “Cordan monte,” or Mount Cordan. Even more significant is hisconviction that this mountain was situated proximo, or “next,” to theterrestrial Paradise; that is, the Garden of Eden.Carver assumed that “Cordan monte” was a reference to the Gordiæus Mountains(also written Gordyene or Corduene), which, he says, the Greco-Roman geographerPtolemy (AD 90–168) located in the district of Armenia Major. Apparently,Ptolemy saw them as at “the same latitude with the springs of the Tigris: Strabojoins them with Mount Taurus.”6 [index_split_058.html#filepos1032425] Today,this mountain range is identified with the Kardu Mountains, which are farthersouth and include Mount al-Judi, the traditional resting place of the ark. Yetthe classical writers located the Gordiæus Mountains north of here, in theEastern Taurus range, which borders the plain of Mush on its southern side.So this fixed the mythical world of Adam, Eve, Seth, and their extended familyfirmly within reach not just of the source of the Tigris, but also Sim Mountain,where Shem and his sons settled, and the Yeghrdut monastery was founded in thefourth century AD. Is this where Adam and Eve came to rest after being expelledfrom the Garden of Righteousness, somewhere in the vicinity of Yeghrdut, whereafterward Shem established his own home? Interestingly, it was Shem who Noahsent to retrieve Adam’s skull from its place of burial in order that it might bebrought on to the ark,7 [index_split_058.html#filepos1032653] even though thebodies of Eve, Seth, and all the other early patriarchs were left in situ.Apparently, the site of Adam’s burial was the “Cave of Treasures,” located on a“Holy Mountain”8 [index_split_058.html#filepos1032809] that was said to overlookthe site of the original Garden of Eden.9 [index_split_058.html#filepos1033043]Did this cave exist somewhere near Yeghrdut, and could it be found today?Of course, the historical validity of any such material is at best questionable,and yet there is no denying that the power of belief in a fictional mythos canbe just as real as if not more real than, a tangible, mundane reality. Moreover,mythical data can encode within it kernels of truth that can manifest in thereal world, and so nothing should be ignored or dismissed out of hand withoutdue consideration.THE SEED OF SETHSo to suddenly find that Adam and Eve’s homeland after their expulsion from theGarden of Eden was somewhere in the vicinity of the Eastern Taurus Mountains wasvery compelling indeed. Moreover, the introduction of Seth to the story was alsohighly significant, as it was the “seed of Seth,” or Seth’s descendants, whowere to inherit God’s kingdom after the death of Adam. This belief is derivedfrom a passage in Genesis 4:25, which reads:> And Adam again knoweth his wife, and she beareth a son, and calleth his name> Seth, “for God hath appointed for me another seed instead of Abel:” for Cain> had slain him.The words “another seed” is interpreted as meaning that through Seth, the thirdson of Adam, God created a new branch of humanity that some Jews and earlyChristians believed was the only truly righteous tribe of God. Everybody elsewas descended of Cain, Seth’s evil brother, and was thus wicked by descent.Many Gnostic sects that thrived in the first five centuries of the Christian erasaw Seth as the first of three manifestations of Christ himself. The otherswould seem to have been Shem, the son of Noah, and Jesus Christ himself. Indeed,the heavenly Seth was seen to have manifested in this world through theincarnation of Jesus, the two being synonymous with each other.THE NAG HAMMADI LIBRARYGnostic followers of Seth, or Sethites as they were known, flourished amongreligious sects and secret groups that thrived in regions such as Palestine,Syria, Asia Minor, Egypt, and Armenia. They had their own gospels, orscriptures, many of which were found together inside a cave near Nag Hammadi inMiddle Egypt in 1945. What became known as the Nag Hammadi library is the mostimportant collection of Gnostic and Sethite texts ever studied. One theory isthat the codices may have belonged to a local Coptic monastery and were buriedfollowing Bishop Athanasius’s condemnation of the use of non-canonical holybooks, that is, those not officially recognized by the Roman Church, in AD 367.Among the Sethian titles in the Nag Hammadi collection are the Three Steles ofSeth, Zostrianos (some see Zostrianos as a manifestation of Zoroaster, thedivine leader of the Zoroastrians), the Second Treatise of the Great Seth, theParaphrase of Shem (or Seth), Allogenes, the Trimorphic Prottenoia, andMelchizedek. These Gnostic gospels have some very interesting things to sayabout Seth, who is occasionally confused or identified with Shem,10[index_split_058.html#filepos1033193] the son of Noah. For instance, it issuggested that before his death, Adam transmitted to Seth certain mattersconcerning everything from the divine or angelic nature of humankind to themovement of the stars and heavenly bodies, and the knowledge of a comingcatastrophe involving fire and water. These “secrets of Adam” are said to havebeen recorded before being hidden away until humanity was ready to receive them.Some of these secrets were to be revealed, periodically, through the appearanceof four Phosters, that is, revealers or illuminators, who would incarnate forthis express purpose,11 [index_split_058.html#filepos1033356] while others wouldremain hidden until the right time for their discovery.THE PILLARS OF SETHWhat intrigued me most about this tradition is that Seth apparently inscribedthe secrets of Adam on pillars or wrote them down on stone tablets, calledsteles, which were then deposited somewhere in the ancient world, usually eitheron or within a mountain cave of some description. For instance, the Jewishwriter Flavius Josephus (AD 37–100), in his book The Antiquities of the Jews,talks about Seth leaving behind children, who “inhabited the same countrywithout dissensions, and in a happy condition.” They were “the inventors of thatpeculiar sort of wisdom which is concerned with the heavenly bodies, and theirorder.” He goes on to write:> And that their inventions might not be lost before they were sufficiently> known, upon Adam’s prediction that the world was to be destroyed at one time> by the force of fire, and at another time by the violence and quantity of> water, they made two pillars, the one of brick, the other of stone: they> inscribed their discoveries on them both, that in case the pillar of brick> should be destroyed by the flood, the pillar of stone might remain, and> exhibit those discoveries to mankind; and also inform them that there was> another pillar of brick erected by them. Now this remains in the land of> Siriad to this day.12 [index_split_058.html#filepos1033505]Here the secrets of Adam are inscribed on pillars, one of brick, the other ofstone, which are erected to preserve this knowledge beyond the coming cataclysminvolving both a conflagration and deluge. So where exactly is Siriad (alsowritten Seiris or Sirian), the named location of the inscribed pillars?THE LAND OF SIRIADBecause of the confusion between Seth, the son of Adam, and Seth, the brother ofOsiris in Egyptian mythology, it has long been assumed that Siriad means Egypt.Here the inhabitants venerated the bright star Sirius, a similar sounding nameto Siriad, while the pillars of Seth themselves were identified with the GreatPyramid and its neighbor, the Second Pyramid. This was a surmise assumed by thescholarly world following the publication in 1737 of a very popular translationof Josephus’s works by English theologian, historian, and mathematician WilliamWhiston (1667–1752).13 [index_split_058.html#filepos1033655] Although Whistondid not believe that the pillars of Seth could have survived the conflagrationand Flood, he did identify the land of Siriad as Egypt.14[index_split_058.html#filepos1033797]Yet this connection with Egypt is a misnomer, for even if Seth did somehowbecome associated with the Great Pyramid, we know that Adam’s son “lived,” asPseudo-Methodius tells us, somewhere in Armenia, which, following the carving upof the Greek Empire after the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, came underthe control of the Syrian Seleucid Empire. Even with the dissolution of theempire in 190 BC, two Seleucid satraps, or governors, revolted and assumedcontrol of Armenia Major and Armenia Minor (or Lesser Armenia), located west ofthe Euphrates River, and proclaimed themselves kings. Hellenic Greek practicesand customs continued to thrive in Armenia and Northern Mesopotamia with all itsSyrian influences. What is more, Edessa’s kings, who were mostly called Abgar orManu, kept their links with Syriac culture and tradition, and retained Syrian asthe main written language.There is really nothing to link the pillars of Seth with Egypt, and all theindications are that Siriad is a straightforward reference to Syria. In fact,before William Whiston’s translation of Josephus’s works, earlier translatorsdid not hesitate to link Siriad with Syria. D. Eduardi Bernardi, for instance,in a translation of Josephus published at Oxford in 1687, discusses whetherSiriad means Syriac in origin or belonging to Syria.15[index_split_058.html#filepos1033957]Elsewhere there is additional evidence that Seth was depositing the “secrets ofAdam” closer to home. For instance, at the end of the Latin Vita Adae et Evae,the “Life of Adam and Eve,” following Adam’s death Eve instructs their childrento write on tablets of stone and clay everything they have learned both from herand their father. During the coming cataclysm, that which is written on stonewill survive the Flood, while that which is written on clay will survive theconflagration. The implication is that Seth then conceals the tablets in thesame vicinity; in other words, somewhere close to the terrestrial Paradise.16[index_split_058.html#filepos1034236]THE ROCK OF TRUTHThe Apocalypse of Adam, one of the Gnostic texts included in the Nag Hammadilibrary, contains the revelation that “Adam taught his son Seth in the sevenhundredth year.” Here Adam tells Seth to record all of his and Eve’s experiencesin the Garden of Paradise (see figure 37.1). This is to include the revelationsconveyed to them by three angelic informants regarding the future adventures ofthe elect, that is, the seed of Seth, along with knowledge of the imminentcataclysm of fire and flood, and details of the coming savior, who is Sethhimself. Collectively, this wisdom is described as the “hidden knowledge ofAdam.” The reader is told also that a special revelation is to be written “on ahigh mountain, upon a rock of truth.”17 [index_split_058.html#filepos1034446][images/00110.jpg]Figure 37.1. Eve at the Fountain, by English visionary painter John Martin(1789–1854), one of twenty illustrations done in mezzotint for the 1827 editionof John Milton’s Paradise Lost.Even though the whereabouts of the land of Siriad, or Seiris, is nowhere givenin the Gnostic gospels, Adam’s secret writings are repeatedly said to be hiddenin a holy mountain. The work known as the Allogenes, for instance, proclaims:“Write down [the things that I Allogenes, a name of Seth] shall [tell] you andof which I shall remind you for the sake of those who will be worthy after you.And you will leave this book upon a mountain and you will adjure the guardian‘Come, O Dreadful One.’”18 [index_split_058.html#filepos1034583]THE GOSPEL OF THE EGYPTIANSThen in The Gospel of the Egyptians, also from the Nag Hammadi library, we read:> This is the book which the great Seth wrote, and placed in high mountains on> which the sun has not risen, nor is it possible. And since the days of the> prophets, and the apostles, and the preachers, the name has not at all risen> upon their hearts, nor is it possible. And ear has not heard it.> The great Seth wrote this book with letters in one hundred and thirty> years. He placed it in the mountain that is called Charaxio, in order that, at> the end of the times and the eras . . . it may come forth and reveal this> incorruptible, holy race of the great savior, and those who dwell with them in> love.19 [index_split_058.html#filepos1034726]These words are greatly enigmatic, for they speak of a book concealed “in” amountain, the location of which, and even the name thereof, has not been utteredsince the time of Seth. Yet then, as if pronounced as part of some magicalspell, the name of the mountain is finally revealed: Charaxio. But where isCharaxio? Was this the true hiding place of the secrets of Adam?THE SEARCH FOR CHARAXIOCharaxio is said to be located “where the sun has not risen, nor is itpossible,” a clear allusion to the Land of Darkness, the otherworldly realm inthe extreme north associated with Alexander the Great’s quest to find theFountain of Life and Gilgamesh’s search to find the plant of immortality. It washere too that the god El had his abode and the two hundred rebel Watchers madethe decision to descend to the plains below and take mortal wives. AsBelgium-based Near Eastern scholar Edward Lipinski determined, the Land ofDarkness existed beyond the virtually impenetrable barrier created by theEastern Taurus Mountains in Armenia Major.Guy G. Stroumsa, a Gnostic scholar with the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, andOxford University, England, has made a study of the mysterious mountain calledCharaxio. He says that various attempts have been made to find its location.However, because Charaxio appears under this name only in The Gospel of theEgyptians, it has proved near impossible to trace. This said, the abbreviatedform, Charax, does appear in antiquity.20 [index_split_058.html#filepos1034879]John Lemprière’s Bibliotheca Classica: A Classical Dictionary, published in1788, reveals just one entry under this name, which is “a town in Armenia.”21[index_split_058.html#filepos1035010]That Charaxio might have been situated in Armenia makes sense of the fact thatit was said to exist where the sun doesn’t shine; that is, in the Land ofDarkness, in the far north. Stroumsa himself took note of this, comparingCharaxio’s description with “the dark regions mentioned in 1 Enoch 78:3”22[index_split_058.html#filepos1035171]; that is, the book of Enoch, which, as wehave seen, can be linked with the Land of Darkness beyond the Tigris Tunnel.Realizing this, Stroumsa alludes to traditions regarding the prophet Enoch beinghanded books from his forefathers Adam and Seth, which he says were concealed onMount Ararat in Armenia, so that they might remain safe during the comingdeluge.23 [index_split_058.html#filepos1035302]MOUNT SIRPushing the matter still further, Stroumsa notes that “the link between Seiris(the land of the sons of Seth and the place of the Steles) and Mount Ararat”finds expression in another Gnostic text called The Hypostatis of the Archons,which is also found in the Nag Hammadi library. He continues: “Noah is asked bythe demiurge (the creator of the physical world) to set the ark upon Mount Sir.. . . In some milieus, the mountain could have been given the name of the landin which the books were written Σειρ(ις)”24[index_split_058.html#filepos1035403]; that is, Seir(is).So Guy Stroumsa proposes that Charaxio, Seiris, and Mount Sir (Seir) are all oneand the same or that they are conflated forms of an original mountain of Seth,which he identifies as Mount Ararat, since this would have been the safest placefor something to have been hidden with foresight of the coming conflagration anddeluge. This is, in my opinion, smart thinking, yet once again we are back toMount Ararat sucking up every legend and tradition that comes along, simplybecause of the Christian fixation with its being the Place of Descent of Noah’sark. Just one Gnostic work actually mentions Mount Ararat by name, this beingthe Pistis Sophia contained in the Askew Codex, a fifth-century parchmentmanuscript of Coptic origin now in the British Library. Yet it speaks only ofJesus in his spiritual form causing the patriarch Enoch to write the so-calledBooks of Yeu (or Jeu) when in Paradise, and then getting him to deposit them forsafekeeping “in the rock Ararad,” where a heavenly ruler is appointed to watchover them during the coming flood.25 [index_split_058.html#filepos1035566] Itdoes not mention Adam or Seth, and certainly makes no direct reference toCharaxio, Seiris, or Mount Sir.So I looked again for any elucidation on the place-name Charaxio and foundsomething very interesting indeed. I discovered that the Araxes River, which wasalso known by the abbreviated form of Arax, was itself once called the Charax,26[index_split_058.html#filepos1035892] making sense of John Lemprière’s entry inhis Bibliotheca Classica regarding a town called Charax in Armenia. Since weknow that the Araxes takes its rise on Bingöl Mountain, the Abus Mons ofantiquity, there has to be a good chance that it is also Charaxio, which withthe –io suffix gives it the meaning “belonging to Charax”; that is, the AraxesRiver.Charaxio’s identification with Bingöl Mountain is strengthened by the words ofStroumsa himself, who concludes for perfectly good reasons that Charaxio,Seiris, and Mount Sir are all synonymous with Bingöl’s main rival, Mount Ararat.Take Mount Ararat out of the picture and you are still left with his firmconviction that somewhere in Armenia Major is the real Charaxio. So was BingölMountain really where Seth concealed the secrets of Adam on pillars or steles inorder that they might be revealed in the final days? It is interesting that JohnLemprière’s entry for Abus Mons reads “a mountain in Syria, where the Euphratesrises.”27 [index_split_058.html#filepos1036241] It confirms that in classicaltimes this region of Armenia Major was still classed as Syria, the ancient landof Siriad or Seiris, where Josephus tells us that Seth concealed his pillars ofknowledge and his descendants continued to live after this time. Yet what aboutMount Sir—where was that located?MONS VICTORIALISA tract entitled Opus Imperfectum in Matthaeum, a commentary on the Gospel ofMatthew, which circulated among a Christian sect known as the Arians during thefifth century, alludes to a lost book or books of Seth. It states that once ayear a group of twelve scholars would climb a mountain called Mons Victorialis,the “Victorious Mountain” or “Mountain of Victory,” on which were abundant“fountains” and beautiful trees, and here they would enter a cave and examine anoriginal work written by Seth.28 [index_split_058.html#filepos1036394]An eighth-century Syriac text known as the “Revelation of the Magi”29[index_split_058.html#filepos1036592] contains the same basic story, althoughhere the twelve scholars are twelve Magi, who are both kings and “wise men,”30[index_split_058.html#filepos1036852] descendants of Seth,31[index_split_058.html#filepos1036982] who live in the land of Shir (i.e., Sir orSeiris).32 [index_split_058.html#filepos1037092] The book takes the form ofcommandments given by Adam to Seth, who records them in written form. It speaksof a sign that will herald the birth of a god in human form, with that signbeing a star in the likeness of a small child.33[index_split_058.html#filepos1037199]Every year the Magi would purify themselves in a spring and then ascend theMountain of Victory and pray in silence before entering the cave, which isidentified as the Cave of Treasures of the Hidden Mysteries.34[index_split_058.html#filepos1037311] (See figure 37.2.) Here Adam and Eve hadlived, just beyond the Garden of Eden, and after their deaths it had become thehome of Seth, his family, and their descendants.This same settlement of the antediluvian patriarchs, as we have already seen,was said by Pseudo-Methodius to have been located near Mount Cordan, in theEastern Taurus range, close to the Yeghrdut monastery and the plain of Mush.Inside the cave the Magi consulted the books of Seth containing the secrets ofAdam and watched for the prophesied sign before returning to their kingdoms toinstruct those of their people who wished to learn of the “hidden mysteries.”The whole process was repeated across many generations, and when one of thetwelve died, either a son or a close relative would replace him.35[index_split_058.html#filepos1037418]The text alludes also to a book of revelations written by Seth, which statesthat Adam had originally seen the sign, the original star child, hanging overthe Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden, but that it had disappeared when hecommitted the first sin.36 [index_split_058.html#filepos1037530] The “Revelationof the Magi” then reveals how a star appears in the sky, before entering thecave, inviting the Magi to do the same. Inside they find not a star, but thelikeness of a small child, who introduces himself as the Son of God. The wisemen are instructed to follow the star so that they might worship him in humanform. They are then led in a quite fantastic manner first to Jerusalem and thento Bethlehem, where the star enters a cave and becomes the infant Jesus, atwhich point the story reverts to the account of the Nativity as told in thegospel of Matthew (2:1–12). Eventually, the Magi return to the land of Shir, andin time the apostle Judas Thomas arrives to convert the people through “mightydeeds”37 [index_split_058.html#filepos1037641]; and here he now baptizes andanoints the Magi.[images/00112.jpg]Figure 37.2. Twelfth-century representation of Adam and Eve inside the Cave ofTreasures, located within Mons Victorialis, the Mountain of Victory. Here livedthe “children of Seth” until the time of the Flood. Its discovery will revealthe books of Seth containing the secrets of Adam.Although there have been attempts to identify the land of Shir with locations asfar away as northeast Iran and even China,38[index_split_058.html#filepos1037749] it was likely located in the vicinity ofthe Cave of Treasures and, of course, the Garden of Eden. What is more, theMountain of Victory, or Mons Victorialis, features in the sixth century Syriactext entitled the book of the Cave of Treasures as a name of the “Mountain ofGod” on which Adam, Eve, and their extended family—the “children of Seth”—liveprior to the time of the Flood. These “children” constitute the entire line ofearly patriarchs and their families, from Seth right down to Noah.39[index_split_058.html#filepos1037916] Enoch is there also, ministering unto Godinside the cave and burying his father, Jared, all this coming before hiscelebrated translation to Paradise in the company of angels (see figure 37.3).According to the book of the Cave of Treasures, at the time of the Flood, Shem,the son of Noah, returns to the cave to retrieve the body of Adam, which is thentaken aboard the ark—the bodies of the other patriarchs being left behind in thecave.40 [index_split_058.html#filepos1038098]So was the land of Shir to be found somewhere in the vicinity of the plain ofMush, the most obvious site of the Garden of Eden? Was it to be identified withSim Mountain, where Shem is said to have established a settlement after leavingthe ark and where Thaddeus deposited the holy relics beneath Yeghrdut’severgreen tree in the first century AD? Remember, the alternative form of theSumerian word for snake, muš, which might well be the root behind the Mushplace-name, is šir, pronounced shir in the Akkadian language. Was the ancientArmenian kingdom of Taron, which included the plain of Mush, once known as theland of Šir, or Shir; that is, the land of the snake? This has to remain a verydistinct possibility indeed.If not in the vicinity of Yeghrdut, was the Mountain of Victory synonymous withBingöl Mountain and Abus Mons, the best candidate by far for Charaxio, themountain where The Gospel of the Egyptians tells us Seth hid his holy book, orbooks, containing the secrets of Adam? Is this where the Cave of Treasures willbe found? Both sites, Yeghrdut and Bingöl, which are visible from each other,might easily have played some dual role in the construction of the Jewish,Gnostic, and later Christian myths concerning the true location not only of theoriginal Garden of Eden but also where Adam and Eve’s descendants, the “childrenof Seth,” are said to have lived on the “holy mountain” of God. No othergeographical region makes sense of all of these disparate stories, showing usquite clearly that in Judeo-Christian tradition this was where the events of thebook of Genesis were played out, no more than a couple of hundred miles awayfrom Göbekli Tepe.So what exactly are the secrets of Adam? Can we go on to determine what Sethactually recorded, either in book form or in stone? As we see next, Adam’ssecrets might well turn out to contain forbidden knowledge regarding the angelicorigins of humankind.[images/00114.jpg]Figure 37.3. The patriarch Enoch is translated to Paradise after being anointedby the angel Michael and becoming like an angel himself."},{"pageContent":"38AS ANGELS OURSELVESWhat exactly are the secrets of Adam? What might they pertain to, and whatrelevance has any of this to Göbekli Tepe and the Yeghrdut monastery located insome quiet corner of the terrestrial Paradise? The first clue is The Gospel ofthe Egyptians, which tells of the creation of the Sethians. They, we are told,constitute “earthly counterparts of a heavenly church of angelic beings, theprototypical Sethians.”1 [index_split_058.html#filepos1038376] Moreover, welearn that when the book or stele that Seth placed in the mountain Charaxio isfound, “it will identify the true race of Seth.”2[index_split_058.html#filepos1038553]There is little question that this “true race of Seth” is to be seen as theincarnated souls of the aforementioned “angelic beings, the prototypicalSethians,” meaning that the secrets of Adam supposedly reveal the angelic natureof humankind.LIKE THE ANGELSWhat exactly does this mean? How can humans become like angels, especially ifthe rebel Watchers of the book of Enoch represent, arguably, a memory of thereal prime movers behind the genesis of civilization? The key is that the angelswere said to have inhabited Paradise itself and so benefited, like Adam and Evebefore the Fall, from the presence of the Tree of Life, which conveys eternallife to whoever or whatever is in its presence.Before the Fall, according to Gnostic tradition, Adam and Eve had spiritualbodies, “like the angels,”3 [index_split_058.html#filepos1038653] but aftertheir expulsion, their bodies grew more and more dense and languid until theywere no more than “coats of skin.”4 [index_split_058.html#filepos1038841] Onlywith the “sweet odour of light,” the perfumed oil from the Tree of Life, wouldthey ever be able to regain their original divine body.5[index_split_058.html#filepos1038941]Not only does any fragment from the Tree of Life remain “true and living,” aconcept reflected in Yeghrdut’s holy tree being “evergreen,” but the Oil ofMercy from the Tree of Life is said to bestow eternal light and life through thesacred process of anointing. Indeed, early Christian tradition asserted thatJesus was himself anointed with oil from the Holy Wood of the Tree of Lifebefore incarnation in order that he might become Christ,6[index_split_058.html#filepos1039041] a word taken from the Greek Xριςτός(Christos), meaning “the Anointed One.”As I already knew, the Tree of Life was anciently believed to have been an olivetree,7 [index_split_058.html#filepos1039388] an evergreen that gave forth afragrance or perfume,8 [index_split_058.html#filepos1039609] a belief connectedwith the story contained in the book of Enoch in which Enoch, on his visit toParadise in the company of two angels, is anointed with an oil fragranced bymyrrh:> And God said to Michael: “Approach and remove Enoch’s earthly garments! Anoint> him with My blessed oil and dress him with garments of My glory! Michael did> what God told him; he anointed me and dressed me. The appearance of the oil> was greater than a great light and its lubricant was like blessed dew, and its> fragrance was like myrrh shining like the sun’s rays. I looked at myself and> saw that I was like one of His glorious ones and there was no obvious> difference.9 [index_split_058.html#filepos1039716]So the removal of Enoch’s physical garments and his anointing with perfumed oilhave the purpose of taking away the patriarch’s earthly skin and replacing itwith divine garments that are symbolic of his transformation from a mortalperson into an angelic being. This is the prerequisite for his permanenttranslation to Paradise, the story told in the book of Genesis.10[index_split_058.html#filepos1040104] Yet it is also a reference to thespiritual bodies, or “garments of light,” that Adam bore before the Fall. Sothrough this anointing process Enoch becomes as Adam was in Paradise, a personrestored to his original state of divine glory, no different from the angelsthemselves.THE HOLY MYRONThe perfumed oil used by the angel or Watcher named Michael to anoint Enoch canbe compared with the Myron (or Muron), also known as the Chrism, used even todayto anoint the Catholicos during his inauguration as spiritual head of theArmenian Church. It is obtained by mixing together pure olive oil with someforty or so herbs and spices, including myrrh, which is then exposed to thesurviving essence of the original holy anointing oil made by Moses underYahweh’s instruction and brought to Yeghrdut in Taron by Thaddeus in the firstcentury.The Myron is considered to convey wisdom through the Holy Spirit or divine lightof God since it bore the similitude of the heavenly Oil of Mercy from the Treeof Life. This is brought out in teachings attributed to Saint Peter, the founderof the Church of Rome, which state that one day Christians will be able toreceive oil that comes directly from the Tree of Life and not simply from somecreated imitation: “If the oil blended by men had such power, think how great isthe oil that was extracted by God himself from a branch of the tree of life.”11[index_split_058.html#filepos1040230]Very similar ideas are behind the anointing not just of church leaders worldwidebut also of kings and queens. At a coronation, it is the anointing of thecandidate that conveys kingship, not the crowning; the placement of the crown ismerely a visible sign of the monarch’s authority to rule in the eyes of God andof his or her newfound divinity.From this it might be assumed that the secrets of Adam, written down by Seth,contain the manner in which we, as mortal humans, are able to regain ourspiritual bodies of light lost at the time of the Fall. To do this and become asangels ourselves, we have to be anointed by the perfumed oil that bears thesimilitude of the Oil of Mercy from the Tree of Life. Within the influence ofthis divinely prescribed substitute for the Oil of Mercy, immortality isassured.Clearly, this is a religious concept, utilized today by Jewish and Christiannations around the world. It might seem also to have little, if anything, to dowith the discovery 170 miles (274 kilometers) from Yeghrdut of Göbekli Tepe. Yetempowerment and otherworldly transformation through the use of specific types ofwood, and the oils and resins extracted from them, is something that might wellhave had its origins in the early Neolithic world of southeast Anatolia.The discovery at Göbekli Tepe of burnt almond wood and spent almond shells12[index_split_058.html#filepos1040406] among the fill covering its sanctuariesindicates that almond oil was almost certainly known here. Its use could easilyhave been the origin behind much later anointing traditions that existed amongthe civilizations of ancient Mesopotamia and the Semitic peoples of the Levant(hence its association with biblical tradition). Interestingly, the rod ofAaron, Moses’s brother, is said to have “bloomed blossoms, which spreading theleaves, were formed into almonds” (Num. 17:8), while the seven-branched candleof the Jews known as the menorah represents both an almond tree and the Tree ofLife. The two are synonymous,13 [index_split_058.html#filepos1040553] eventhough elsewhere the Tree of Life, as we have seen, is said to be an olive tree.LINKS TO YEGHRDUTIn view of all this, the fact that Thaddeus travels all the way from Judea viaEdessa to Yeghrdut to deposit both a fragment of the Tree of Life and the bottlecontaining the essence of the perfumed oil that Yahweh had instructed Moses tomake has incredible implications. It suggests that the disciple was taking themto somewhere already connected with traditions associated with the Oil of Mercyand Tree of Life. This he recognized through the presence there of an earthlyrepresentation of the Tree of Life in the form of Yeghrdut’s own evergreen tree,from beneath which flowed a source of the Euphrates, one of the four rivers ofParadise. It tells us also that Yeghrdut was considered the true foundationpoint of the Armenian Church, the Myron bottle and fragment of the Tree of Lifebeing its symbols of divine authority over counter claims of supremacy fromrival monastic foundations.Of course, it might easily be argued that the Armenian Church made up the entirestory of Thaddeus’s visit to Yeghrdut and his concealment there of the holyrelics. Yet if this were the case, why connect the legend with Yeghrdut and notSurb Karapet, Taron’s showcase monastery on the opposite side of the plain ofMush? Why attribute this extraordinary tradition to Yeghrdut when Surb Karapetwould have been a much better option, especially as it was founded aroundimportant relics of John the Baptist? Alternatively, why not connect the storyto the Mother See of Holy Echmiadzin at Vagharshapat, Armenia’s great spiritualcenter located within sight of Mount Ararat, where eventually Yeghrdut’s sacredcontainer was moved so that the holy Myron might continue to be manufacturedthere?Everything points toward a long-held tradition suggesting that Yeghrdut’severgreen tree was seen to mark the site of the terrestrial Tree of Life,planted by Seth either within or upon the skull of Adam, the first man. Ifcorrect, then close by was the Cave of Treasures, where Adam and the earlypatriarchs lived and were buried after the time of the Fall, and the book orbooks containing the secrets of Adam lay hidden within the Mountain of Victory,located in the land of Shir, or Seir.In Gnostic tradition, Seth incarnates to save his “seed” on three occasions:first as Seth, the man; second as Shem, the son of Noah; and finally as JesusChrist (his lives as Seth and Jesus both linking him with traditions concerningthe Oil of Mercy). A. F. J. Klijn in his important work Seth in Jewish,Christian and Gnostic Literature (1977) says that the “race of Seth” may havebeen a historical phenomena “which existed until the flood or [they were] agroup which was to be saved at the end of time.”14[index_split_058.html#filepos1040682] Yet as much as these ideas regarding thebooks, steles, or pillars of Seth are bound up in Jewish, Christian, and Gnosticmillennialism, can they really be linked to the discoveries being made today atGöbekli Tepe?THE CHILDREN OF SETHAn ancient Jewish religious work known as the book of Jubilees, which, like thebook of Enoch, has been found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, talks about Cainan,the son of Arphaxad, or Arpachshad, who found “a writing which the ancestorsengraved on stone,” reminding us of the pillars or steles on which Seth wrotethe secrets of Adam. These writings contained “the teaching of the Watchers bywhich they used to observe the omens of the sun and moon and stars within allthe signs of heaven.”15 [index_split_058.html#filepos1040846]It was this same starry wisdom that became the foundation of the beliefs of theChaldeans; that is, the Sabaean star-worshippers of Harran, theten-thousand-year-old city located on the plain beneath the gaze of Göbekli Tepe(see the Prologue for the full story). Arphaxad, Cainan’s father, is said tohave been the progenitor of the Chaldeans of Harran.16[index_split_058.html#filepos1041030] His name, Arphaxad, is a conflation of theplace-name “Ur of the Chaldees,”17 [index_split_058.html#filepos1041194]Abraham’s birthplace in nearby Şanlıurfa, showing the firm connection betweenthese early biblical characters and the triangle d’or, the birthplace of theNeolithic revolution. Completing the picture is the fact that Arphaxad’s fatherwas Shem, the son of Noah, whose settlement at Simsar, or Sim Mountain, in theEastern Taurus range overlooking the plain of Mush, is today occupied by theYeghrdut monastery.Interestingly, the Sabaeans, the pagan inhabitants of Harran, were said to havebeen “worshippers of fire called Magi” and claimed to be keepers of themysterious “book of Seth,” because their founder was one “Sabius, a son ofSeth.”18 [index_split_058.html#filepos1041344] Moreover, they asserted that “weacknowledge the religion of Seth, Idris (Enoch) and Noah.”19[index_split_058.html#filepos1041502] So could the original book or books ofSeth have been carved stone pillars, like those being uncovered today at nearbyGöbekli Tepe? Were the twelve Magi that perpetually guarded the book or books ofSeth an echo, however slight, of the rings of twelve anthropomorphic pillarserected at Göbekli Tepe some 11,500 years ago? Could these rings of stonereflect much later traditions regarding the “children of Seth” preserving thesecrets of Adam in written form? If so, then who or what might the twin centralpillars have come to represent in Jewish, Christian, and Gnostic tradition?Too much speculation here would be foolish, although the fact that Gnosticwritings emphasize that Cain and Abel, the twin sons of Adam, each had twinsisters is intriguing and reminds us of the belief that twins always grew insidethe womb during pregnancy. Moreover, that Seth was born as Abel’s replacementsets up a twinlike relationship between Cain and Seth, reflected in the storiesregarding our descendancy either from the “sons of Cain” or the “seed of Seth”;that is, the Sethites. The central pillars at Göbekli Tepe are perhaps allusionsto this twin tradition, although whether they can be seen in terms of the twinoffspring of Adam, the first man, who in Gnostic teachings was overshadowed byhis own celestial twin, is another matter altogether.So in addition to revealing humanity’s dual origins, angelic and mortal, doGöbekli Tepe’s T-shaped pillars reflect an understanding of Adam’s “astrologicalknowledge” which might have included information regarding the appearance ofshort-period comets? One brilliant-minded person once wrote that the secrets ofAdam, handed down to Seth and Enoch, might have been “the knowledge of months,years and periods of comets that the remote generations had acquired—and thehope grew into faith that no such or similar destruction would come any more todecimate mankind.”20 [index_split_058.html#filepos1041664]That person was Russian-Jewish psychiatrist Immanuel Velikovsky (1895–1979), oneof the greatest catastrophe theorists of the twentieth century. He realizedthat, in all likelihood, any such secret information had to relate not just tothe conflagration and deluge itself but also to how to ensure that suchcatastrophes never again trouble our world.Out there somewhere, in some lonely spot on Bingöl Mountain (in its likely roleas Charaxio), or maybe in the vicinity of the Yeghrdut monastery (as a potentiallocation of the Cave of Treasures), are perhaps the true secrets of Adam.Inscribed on standing pillars or on steles, similar to those seen today atGöbekli Tepe, they await discovery and interpretation. They might reveal how we,as mortal humans, can restore our bodies of light, lost at the time of the Fall,and be as angels ourselves; in other words, become as one with our incorporealselves left behind during the process of incarnation on this earthly plane. Theymight also provide confirmation that the world was once brought to its knees bya comet impact and that only afterward did the genesis of civilization beginhere in eastern Anatolia, the true location of the Garden of Eden.A TRIP TO TURKEYThere was only one thing left for me to do, and this was to go to Turkey, whereI would visit the ruins of the Yeghrdut monastery and get out to Bingöl Mountainsomehow. I needed to find out what I could about these places and inquirelocally into any folklore, myths, and legends that might help bring alive theirgeomythic reality. From there I would journey to Göbekli Tepe, where I hoped tointerview Professor Klaus Schmidt.I knew the region pretty well from my years of research, having visited GöbekliTepe, Çayönü, Harran, and Karahan Tepe back in 2004. However, I saw one slightproblem looming on the horizon like a dark cloud, and this was the fact that themountains around Mush, including Bingöl Dağ and the Eastern Taurus Mountainsbeyond Yeghrdut, were currently the front line for the Kurdish uprising headedby the PKK, the Kurdistan Workers Party. They have been fighting for Kurdishindependent rule and an autonomous Turkish Kurdistan for the past thirty-fiveyears. Although most of the offensives against them by the Turkish army andsecret police are today concentrated in the mountainous region close to theborder with Iraqi Kurdistan, I was shocked to find that there had been recentmilitary operations against the PKK in the area of Zengok (modern Yörecik), avillage just 7 miles (11 kilometers) from the Yeghrdut monastery ruins, and evenon a mountain named Kozma Dağ, immediately to the south of Dera Sor.As the date of my departure for Turkey grew nearer, the matter did begin toworry me, yet there was very little I could do. Nothing, not even my betterjudgment, was going to stop me from getting out to Yeghrdut, which, however youlook at it, was first introduced to my world though a simple, though quiteprofound dream."},{"pageContent":"39THE RETURN TO EDENMonday, September 10, 2012. After a night spent in a dismal hotel on theoutskirts of Istanbul, I journeyed on to eastern Turkey. From the small airportat Mush, a taxi took me to the hotel, which lay on the edge of town. Close bywas the road out to the villages of Kızılağaç and Suluca, near to which I wouldfind Dera Sor, the ruins of the Yeghrdut monastery.The next morning, over breakfast, I was able to appreciate exactly where I wasfor the first time. Through the hotel’s panoramic windows I could see the plainof Mush stretching away in every direction, beyond which was a seeminglyimpenetrable wall of mountains, reminding me of the seven mountains thatencircle the Garden of Righteousness, according to the book of Enoch.1[index_split_058.html#filepos1042024] Only toward the east did they seem tolower slightly, and here I thought I could make out the summit of Nemrut Dağ,the extinct volcano on the western shores of Lake Van.THE TAXI RIDEWith breakfast over I waited in the lobby as the hotel owner made various phonecalls. These resulted in a taxi driver arriving just after ten, although theguide-interpreter situation was not good, apparently. For two hours I dranksweet black tea and waited, until finally two guys turned up, both quite young,one of whom said he was usually paid the going rate as an interpreter for theEuropean Union, which worried me slightly due to the potential expense. Theother was his friend, who also spoke good English. Very quickly we were in thetaxi on our way out to Suluca.No one had heard of Dera Sor, or Yeghrdut, which seemed bizarre. I was tellingthem about a sacred site, an ancient ruin of substantial size with a fascinatinghistory spanning nearly two thousand years, yet nobody knew a thing about it. Ifit had not been for the images I had brought along that showed Dera Sor onGoogle Earth, my new friends might not have believed it even existed.As the taxi left the outskirts of town, I followed the route closely to ensurewe were going in the right direction, but the driver knew Suluca, and very soonwe were on a side road leading toward the foothills of the Eastern TaurusMountains and a cluster of prefabricated buildings. We stopped to ask the way toDera Sor, and an old man pointed immediately toward the heavily forestedmountain slope behind him. So at least the ruins still existed and were known tothe villagers of Suluca.The elderly man climbed into the taxi and guided us to the start of an unmadetrack that marked the beginning of a very bumpy ride in a vehicle that wasscarcely suitable for such a journey. As we climbed higher and higher, generallywith the steep hillside to our left, we rose above the surrounding landscape,which stretched away to the north, and for the first time I got a glimpse of theMurad Şu, or Eastern Euphrates, winding its way across the plain of Mush.PKK SITUATIONI did inquire about the situation with the PKK locally and was informed that themountains were under rebel control, so much so that Turkish forces did not evenventure into the area unless it was part of an official military offensive. Iasked also about the chances of getting to Bingöl Mountain and was told thatthis area was currently an active front line and thus a no-go zone to visitorslike me. This was a massive disappointment, but for the moment my principal goalwas to get to Yeghrdut.After driving for around fifteen to twenty minutes, we leveled out but stillfaced the prospect of an even higher climb to the east of our position. The taxidriver seemed lost, the guide and his friend didn’t know what to do, and no onewas around to ask for directions. My map seemed useless, so the only option leftwas to stand on a high spot and just look for any sign of ruins.It was the guide’s friend who first spotted Dera Sor. Over on a ridge, abouthalf a mile away, was what appeared to be a long, red wall on a flat ridge. Thathad to be it, and without further ado we were back in the taxi trying to reachthe spot. The path seemed strewn with potholes, so we left the vehicle in thecapable hands of the guide’s friend and continued on foot in the baking hot sun.The track lifted up over an incline, beyond which on the left was a ridge ofpine trees. I was struck immediately by the extreme redness of the earth,created no doubt by sandstone with a heavy iron oxide content that had longsince crumbled to dust. To the right the ground sloped away toward the plainbelow. Scrub and a few clumps of trees grew here and there, but generally theland seemed parched and dry.THE DERA SOR COMMUNITYComing into view now was a group of large, wigwamlike tents, some covered withwhite tarpaulin, others with tree branches. There were also circular pens fullof turkeys and plenty of goats running loose around the whole camp. People werealready emerging to see what all the commotion was about. I felt that the sightof an Englishman in desert suit, straw trilby hat, and black-framed glasses wasnot the norm for these people. Coming out to meet us were women wearing brightlycolored hijab headscarves, several small children, three young men in their lateteens, and a tall, thin, elderly gentleman with large moustache, gray jacket,and traditional Turkish fez, a black one that had seen better days. He was quiteclearly the leader of the small community, which numbered fifteen to twentyindividuals.These people were seasonal pastoralists, who live out on the mountainside duringthe summer months, then retire to more urban environments when the cold weathersets in around November. From then on until March or April, the whole region canbe covered from top to bottom in thick snow, making life very difficult indeed.Our guide greeted the fez-wearing man and his family, and conversations ensuedregarding the purpose of our visit. The subject of the ruins was discussed, andfrom the nods and points toward a large earthen ridge of debris immediately westof the settlement, above which I could see the tops of red-stone walls, Irealized that there was no obvious problem with our being here. Yet before goingany further I asked the elderly man about the monastery’s sacred tree and holyspring. Did he know where these were?A VISIT TO THE SPRINGExchanges between the guide and the leader resulted in our moving out intoparched scrubland between the camp and the ruins. Not 40 yards (37 meters) fromwhere we had stood was the spring, close to the base of the north-facing hillslope. From its sunken entrance, marked by an arch of large, flat stones, theleader removed a mesh of tree branches bound together with nails, and put thereto prevent animals from contaminating the water. With this I sought permissionto climb inside the cramped space, created by a rounded roof of stoneworkoverlaid with earth.I wanted to get some pictures and drink a little water, which I now saw came upinto a small pool before trickling away beneath the earth. Farther down the hillthe water flow reemerged from a metal pipe, creating the beginnings of theKilise Şu stream, which flows into the Eastern Euphrates. I was now at a sourceof one of the four rivers of Paradise.Despite Yeghrdut’s location on the edge of Paradise, I was dismayed to seeplastic cups and containers, as well as cooking utensils and half-buried dustbinliners, strewn about inside the hollow. It was clear that the spring was nolonger seen as sacred, a fact confirmed through conversations with thefez-wearing man.THE HOLY TREEI asked next to see the old walnut tree, which had been renowned throughout theentire province as a place of healing (see figure 39.1 on p. 346). Our hostsnodded, ushering us on another 20 yards (18 meters) to a dusty patch of ground.Here they pointed toward the remains of an old tree stump still in situ, with agirth of around 5 feet (1.5 meters). Clearly, this was not the originalevergreen tree that had stood on the spot in Thaddeus’s day, but it wascertainly a potent symbol of its former presence here.[images/00116.jpg]Figure 39.1. Dera Sor, the ruins of the Yeghrdut monastery, in snow, from aGoogle Earth image taken on April 1, 2009. Note the walnut tree, the finalincarnation of the “evergreen tree,” under which the disciple Thaddeusapparently deposited a piece of the Tree of Life and the container that held theessence of holy oil used to anoint “prophets and apostles.” Courtesy ofDigitalGlobe 2013.When I inquired about what had happened to the tree, I was told that it hadfallen down around two years earlier, and that two trucks were needed to carryaway all the timber. Hearing this made me incredibly sad and a little annoyedthat the tree had not been better preserved, especially given that it reflectednearly two thousand years of history at the site.According to what I had found out over the past few months,2[index_split_058.html#filepos1042189] the evergreen tree under which Thaddeushad concealed the holy relics was said to have survived to the present day, anunlikely claim particularly after examining the pitiful remains of the walnuttree. According to tradition, an eagle had nested at the summit of the originaltree. A flowing stream emerged from beneath its trunk, and a stone wall, with analtar at one end, had protected its roots. Women and young ladies in particularwould come here not just to rest beneath its shade but also to take water fromthe stream to cure ailments. They would take away any small part of the treethey could find—leaves, bark, twigs, and so forth, which would be placed insidetheir clothes, against the body, to relieve pain. Apparently, any greeneryremoved from the tree was the ultimate healing aid, with the ability to retainits healing potency forever.3 [index_split_058.html#filepos1042354]I learned also that the fragment of the Tree of Life deposited at Yeghrdut byThaddeus was the subject of a quite extraordinary legend.4[index_split_058.html#filepos1042454] One day a shepherd visiting the monasterysaw the simple box containing the relic and decided to steal it, thinking thatits contents might be worth money. He got home and decided to take a look atwhat was inside. Yet on seeing that it contained a piece of wood, the manpanicked and threw the box on the fire. No sooner had he done this than flamesburst forth from the hearth and consumed the entire house, sending the shepherdrunning for his life.Prompted by the fire, the great eagle that guarded the holy tree then swoopeddown and snatched up the box with its precious contents, neither of which hadbeen damaged in any way. The bird took them back to its nest and thereafterbecame their constant guardian, never letting anyone with ill intent near them.EAGLE ON THE WORLD TREEThis legend, which seems like something out of a book of Turkish folktales, wasbelieved fervently by the monks of the monastery and is included in the entryfor Yeghrdut in the aforementioned encyclopedia of monasteries and churches ofthe Taron Province.5 [index_split_058.html#filepos1042554] Whatever its reality,the story oozes mythological symbolism. The eagle sitting atop the tree guardinga piece of the Tree of Life is suggestive of the world tree Yggdrasil in Norsetradition, which also has an eagle nesting on its summit.The similarity between the name Yeghrdut and Yggdrasil is probably coincidental,although it has not stopped people from drawing comparisons between yggdr, onepossible root behind the name Yeghrdut, and Yggdrasil, and also between Hızır,or al-Khidr, a guardian of the Waters of Life, and Odin, the god who hangs onthe Norse world tree to gain the knowledge of the runic alphabet.6[index_split_058.html#filepos1042654] Interestingly, compelling evidenceindicates that the origins of some Norse mythology, and perhaps even the rootsof the Scandinavian people, are to be looked for in the region around Lake Van.World-renowned explorer Thor Heyerdahl (1914–2002) was working on these theoriesshortly before his death.7 [index_split_058.html#filepos1043022] The exactderivation of the word Yeghrdut still remains unclear, as it is not a properArmenian word, although it does seem to relate to Armenian word roots meaning“king,” “flower,” and “willow,”8 [index_split_058.html#filepos1043467] or, as Ihad already established, shuyugho, the “young branch of the (oil tree).”9[index_split_058.html#filepos1043838]The eagle itself was the symbol of the ancient kingdom of Taron, which wasestablished in the fourth century AD by an Armenian dynasty of kings called theMamikonians, whose emblem was the double-headed eagle. This connection betweenTaron and the eagle might easily have stemmed from the existence of a pagan godin the form of an eagle that was venerated in Armenia Major during former ages.The association between the eagle of Yeghrdut and the holy tree, however, mightwell stem from a source much closer to the root of the mystery.THE WOOD THAT CUTSThere are many different variations of the story of how the Holy Wood or HolyTimber of Life used to create the Cross of Calvary, which originated in somemanner from the Tree of Life. One version has Adam being given a branch upon hisdeparture from the Garden of Eden; in another it is handed to Seth in the formof seeds or saplings; and in still another a bird known as the roc, a gigantic,mythical eagle of Arabic tradition, picks up “a piece of wood from one of thetrees in the garden.”10 [index_split_058.html#filepos1043999] This mythical birdcarries the branch to Jerusalem and there drops it onto a huge, upside-downcopper cauldron, beneath which is the bird’s young. They are being held captiveby King Solomon, who has snatched them away from their mother after searchingfor guidance from God as to how he might go about finishing the temple begun byhis father, David.The weight of the wood smashes the cauldron, releasing the bird’s young.Thereafter, Solomon realizes that the wood left by the roc can miraculously cutstone blocks, enabling the king to complete the temple. Following a long storyinvolving King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, the Holy Wood finds its way tothe carpenter’s shop, where, as in the more traditional story, it is fashionedinto the cross on which Christ is crucified.11[index_split_058.html#filepos1044146]The important part of this story is that this piece of wood taken from “one ofthe trees in the garden,” an allusion unquestionably to the Tree of Life, islinked with an eaglelike bird, just as it is in the Yeghrdut legend. This lendssupport to the belief that the monastery had in its possession a fragment of theHoly Wood of Life thought to derive from the Tree of Life itself.THE RUINS EXPLOREDAfter asking for and getting a few small fragments of the remaining tree trunk(as well as a walnut shell, confirming it as the holy tree mentioned in thecorrespondence with the contact from Kızılağaç), we now moved on to the goal ofthe expedition—the monastery itself. Walking about 40 yards (37 meters) we nowclimbed a huge pile of rubble and debris and saw spread out before us the ruinsin all their glory. The raised mound marked the position of the structure’seastern wall, while similar piles of rubble marked the location of the north andsouth walls. However, in the west, the remaining wall, made up of a thick baseof rust-red bricks and an upper level of lighter-colored gray stone, wassubstantial, being as much as 15 feet (4.5 meters) in height, with a largebreach toward its northern end.In all, the west wall was around 70 yards (64 meters) in length, with areturning wall at its southern end, which quickly reduces down to ground level.Walking up to the remaining wall, I noticed a series of linear foundationsjutting out at right angles, which I suspected marked the position of smallcells, most likely living quarters for the monks. It is incredible to think thatthis immense structure was, apparently, two stories high and almost equal insize to the more famous monastery of Surb Karapet, located in the foothills ofthe Armenian Highlands on the opposite side of the plain of Mush (indeed, themonasteries, both dedicated to Saint John the Baptist, would each have beenvisible to the other).FINDING THE CHURCHESThe only other architectural features that remain standing at the monastery siteare two beautiful stones arches, around 12 feet (3.7 meters) high, onepositioned directly in front of the other (see figure 39.2 on p. 350). These areoriented east-northeast (at approximately 20 degrees north of east) and onceformed the northern entrance into a large building located in the southeastquadrant of the monastery. All around the arches are piles of rubble and debris,reducing their interior height, although it is still possible to pass beneaththem fairly comfortably.[images/00117.jpg]Figure 39.2. Plan of Dera Sor, the ruins of the Yeghrdut monastery, drawn by theauthor following his return from the site in September 2012. Note the differentalignment of the building structure contained within the southeast quadrant ofthe perimeter wall, suggesting that it might belong to a different age.The identity of the ruins attached to the twin arches has been impossible toestablish with any degree of certainty, as no surviving photographs or plans ofthe monastery have been found.12 [index_split_058.html#filepos1044253] Presentsomewhere in the monastery’s southeast quadrant was a large, domed churchdedicated to the Mother of God. Attached to it was a chapel of Saint John theBaptist in which was a martyrium where the saint’s relics were kept. Here toowas another chapel dedicated to Gregory the Illuminator, located beyond thechurch’s northwest corner. Its position was marked by an imposing bell tower,under which was a walkway into the main church, the walls of which wereconstructed of stone in three different colors—black, yellow, and reddish brown.Apparently, the bell tower collapsed during an earthquake in 1866, a portentperhaps of the imminent destruction of the monastery and the disappearance ofits monks at the time of the Armenian Genocide of 1915. Exactly what happenedhere at Yeghrdut may never be known, but it is unlikely to have been pleasant,and as for the fate of the monastery’s precious relics, no one can say. ThoseArmenians who remain today in Mush have adopted a radical form of Islam, so itis unlikely that any real answers will be forthcoming any time soon.I was pretty sure that the bell tower was located somewhere in the vicinity ofthe stone arches; indeed, they might easily have formed its support columns,under which one passed to enter the main church. In my dream the monks hadconducted the strange ritual involving the elevation of the fragment of the Treeof Life at the center of the church. So I now stood the closest I was going toget to that very spot, which was a strange sensation, especially after travelingnearly 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers) to be there.SPECTACULAR VIEWSAs I moved across to the piles of debris marking the north wall, I realized justhow spectacular the view was from this elevated position; to say it wasimpressive would be an understatement. The monastery, as I knew only too well,looked out across the plain of Mush and the Eastern Euphrates, beyond which werethe foothills and peaks of the Armenian Highlands. Yet the monastery itself issheltered beneath hilly slopes to the southeast, south, and west, which wouldhave afforded it some degree of protection from the elements during the long,harsh winters.For an hour or so, I followed the course of the perimeter wall, obtainingphotos, getting video footage, and taking in the ambience, always with one ofour hosts by my side. Scattered everywhere were potsherds of all shapes andsizes, which I could see embraced a time frame from medieval times right down tothe modern day. However, I was not concerned with ceramics on this occasion. Iwanted to find evidence that the site had been occupied prior to the arrival ofChristianity in the fourth century. Yet, in all honesty, I found nothing ofinterest, even though there was every possibility that a settlement from aformer age could have occupied a position higher up the hill, closer to itssummit perhaps.One legend fervently believed by the monks of Yeghrdut tells how near “a smallworkshop” somewhere beyond the monastery, a concealed copy of the “OldTestament” was found. It was apparently seen as a gift of the eagle, presumablythe one that lived in the holy evergreen tree.13[index_split_058.html#filepos1044540] The implication of this chance discoveryis that the book belonged to an age that antedated the monastery, implying thatthe site was important even before the arrival of Gregory the Illuminator in thefourth century.IS THIS EDEN?It was very difficult to take in the setting during this one brief visit. Mysense, however, was that the monastery had been deliberately left to fall intodecay. The site had been neglected, this was clear, and no one really seemedinterested in its history or preservation. It was difficult to come to termswith the fact that until 1915 Yeghrdut had been a thriving monastery, as well asa tranquil place of healing for Armenians and Kurds alike. Men and women camehere not just to cure ailments but also to rejuvenate both body and soul. Therewas a natural vitality about this site, which people believed was channeledthrough the holy tree and spring, the reason they took away leaves, twigs, andbark, not to mention the holy water itself.All that is now gone. All that remains is the tranquillity of the site and itsextraordinary setting, which is simply outstanding. This was the sight the monksof Yeghrdut woke up to every morning, making it easy to understand why theymight have believed this was some quiet corner on the edge of Eden itself.THE RED EARTH OF ADAMThe monks also cannot have failed to notice the absolute redness of the earth,especially the hill slope to the southeast of the monastery. It would havereminded them that the first-century Jewish scholar Flavius Josephus wrote thatAdam was created out of red clay:> That God took dust from the ground, and formed man, and inserted in him a> spirit and a soul. This man was called Adam, which in the Hebrew tongue> signifies one that is red, because he was formed out of red earth, compounded> together; for of that kind is virgin and true earth.14> [index_split_058.html#filepos1044706]Another tradition said that after Adam’s death, he was buried by angels “in thespot where God found the dust” to fashion his body.15[index_split_058.html#filepos1044852] So if the monks did see the red earthsurrounding the monastery as significant (and it is rarely glimpsed anywhereelse in the area), then it might well have strengthened the conviction thattheir monastery existed close to the site where Adam and Eve lived after theirexpulsion from Paradise, and where afterward their son Seth and his descendantscontinued to live right down to the time of the flood.A RESPITEAfter completing our visit to the ruins, the elderly man and his wife opened uptheir home to us. Inside the large, conical tent, its opening directed towardthe plain below, we sat down on a bed of brightly patterned kilim rugs thatoverlaid a bed of flat stone slabs. Placed in front of us was an enormous silverplatter containing glasses of sweet tea and bowls of local food, includingyogurt, Turkish flat bread, and salad. The kindness of these people wasoverwhelming, particularly as they did not know me, our guide, or the taxidriver, who were all afforded the same degree of hospitality.I then learned something important from the fez-wearing man. He told me thatsomewhere on the hill slope, immediately behind the monastery’s west wall, therewas once a large cave opening. Yet it had vanished after the “rich” Armenianmonks had stuffed it full of “gold” prior to their rapid departure. Local peoplehad attempted to find the cave entrance in order to reach the “gold,” but so farall efforts had come to nothing.I found the story difficult to believe, first, because there was no sign of anycave existing today (I checked afterward), and, second, the fervent belief thatArmenian monks were so rich that they simply could not carry away all theircumbersome gold treasure was quite simply fantasy. The only thing it did do wasremind me of the legends regarding the Cave of Treasures, where Adam, Eve, Seth,and their family had lived and where they were supposedly buried upon theirdeaths. Was the role model for the Cave of Treasures around here somewhere, ifnot close to the monastery, then in the foothills of the mountains immediatelyto the south of Yeghrdut? Was it there that the secrets of Adam, inscribedeither on steles or pillars, would one day be found? Or was it north of theplain of Mush, somewhere in the vicinity of Bingöl Mountain? There were no hardand fast answers, and for now the matter would have to rest there.One other piece of information I picked up was that around fifteen years before,workmen had arrived one day and broken down whole sections of the monastery’sremaining walls, with the resulting piles of rubble being carried away inwaiting trucks. Hearing this instantly made me concerned about the fate of theremaining ruins, which are not protected in any manner, and so could,presumably, be destroyed at any time.Shortly after that it was time to leave. A thunderstorm was close by, and onceit hit, any resulting flash floods could make driving back down the mountainsidetreacherous. So as the taxi now began to make its descent, I watched awestruckas a rolling gray cloud came in from the west and seemed to follow the course ofthe Euphrates, sending out lightning flashes that struck the plain of Mush andeven the waters of the river itself. No wonder the Semitic peoples of Syria andCanaan came to believe that the abode of the god El was to be found in thisotherworldly Land of Darkness.AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEYThat night and the next day I recorded my thoughts and impressions about thetrip to the monastery. There was a sense that I had achieved what I had comehere to do, but I wanted to go back one more time, and this I managed to do onWednesday, September 12, with the same taxi driver, although this time with anew guide, a social worker named Idris, who spoke perfect English. He knew everyvillage, large and small, on the plain of Mush, as he visits them as part of hisday-to-day job. We shared a mutual passion for keeping alive the rich culturalheritage of the region and so very quickly became friends.The following day Idris asked if I would like to accompany him the next day to avillage called Muska, not far from Bingöl Mountain. He had friends there whowere Alevi and thought this might be an ideal opportunity for me to speak withthem about their beliefs and practices. Even though I was due to leave Mushearly the morning after that, this was too good an opportunity to miss, so Isaid yes.I asked Idris about the situation regarding access to Bingöl Mountain, as Iunderstood it was a virtual no-go area because of the recent army offensives. Hesaid we would be fine and that if we did encounter any PKK units in the hills,he knew what to say (Kurdish sympathy among the local population runs very highindeed). With that, I accepted finally that I might get to glimpse BingölMountain, at least from a distance, which is something I had almost abandonedany thought of achieving on this journey of discovery."},{"pageContent":"40A TRIP TO PARADISEFriday, September 14, 2012. The drive by dolmus (a Turkish minibus) from Mush tothe Alevi town of Varto, in the foothills of the Armenian Highlands, wasbreathtaking. After leaving the great plain, the road follows the course of theEastern Euphrates, which runs alongside the road for part of the way. Once thathad veered away toward the east, the vehicle climbed ever higher until, finally,we entered Varto itself. The town is a bustling hive of activity even in thebaking hot sun, and having left behind the dolmus, we journeyed on foot until wereached a local hospital, where Idris picked up a car for us to complete thejourney (it belonged to a work colleague).After departing Varto, we moved into a beautiful green landscape, utterlydifferent from the dusty, volcanic earth that proliferates on the plain of Mush,and very soon my eyes became focused on something I never expected to see onthis journey—the summit of Bingöl Mountain looming up ahead. Seeing it as asingle mountain is in fact inaccurate, for Bingöl is in reality a north-southoriented ridge, or massif, with two separate peaks, linked by a saddlebackindentation.MOUNTAIN LIONUnbelievably, the car journey took us right alongside the mountain, which was onour right-hand side at a distance of no more than 4–5 miles (6.5–8 kilometers).What I saw transfixed me, for the twin peaks give the mountain’s elevated summitthe likeness of a large feline, most obviously a lion, its protruding head,shoulders, and forelegs made up of the northern peak, with the saddlebackindentation and southern peak creating the creature’s body, hind legs, and tail(see plate 31 [index_split_031.html#filepos439352]). The whole thing looks as ifit is emerging from the mountain’s rocky surface in order to rise into the sky.The form is unmistakable and cannot have been missed by those who inhabited theregion in the past. Of course, not everyone is going to interpret this rocksimulacrum as a lion, although the likeness is striking enough for it to haveimpressed some people along the way, including perhaps the Armenians who wouldcome here each spring to venerate Anahita, the goddess of fertility and thewaters of life. She is depicted in Persian religious art as a shining beingstanding on a lion.PEOPLE OF TRUTHA lion sitting astride a world mountain, guarding the axis mundi or world pillaras Bingöl Mountain appears to do in Armenian myth and legend, reminded me alsoof a similar leonine beast featured in the creation myth of a Kurdish religionnamed Ahl-e Haqq, which means “People of Truth.” Although this ethnoreligiousgroup, known also as the Yâresân, exists mostly in Iraqi Kurdistan and northwestIran, some still remain in remote parts of eastern Turkey. According to them, acharismatic leader named Sultan Sahak founded the Ahl-e Haqq religion during thefourteenth century, although beyond that their origins remain obscure.As part of the Yâresân creation myth, the divine essence, called Khavankar,brings into existence the seven Haftan, or archangels, and two of them, Ruchiyarand Ayvat (or Yar), become a cow and lion, respectively. The divine essence thencreates a fish in the primordial waters and places a large white stone on itsback. The cow then steps on the white stone, and the lion stands on the back ofthe cow. The divine essence places the earth on the horn of the cow, and on thehead of the lion he places the “Supreme Sphere”; that is, the vault of heaven.1[index_split_058.html#filepos1045081]The relationship of the fish, cow, and lion expresses a three-tiered universe,with a watery abyss in the lower world, a material existence in the middleworld, and a cosmic realm in the upper world, all of them linked via animaginary line of ascent.COSMIC LIONElsewhere in Yâresân myth the lion is the avatar of Ali, the son-in-law andcousin of Muhammad,2 [index_split_058.html#filepos1045214] just as he is in thebeliefs of the Alevi, who probably share similar traditions. The Alevi see Alias the first of the twelve imams, or spiritual leaders, and depict him as a lionsurrounded by twelve stars. This echoes the lion-headed figure named ZurvanAkarana featured in the religion of Zurvanism, a form of Zoroastrianism oncepracticed in Armenia. He is the kosmokrator, or controller of the revolution oftime, symbolized by the seven planets and the twelve signs of the zodiac.Clearly, throughout the region the lion was seen as some kind of cosmic beingassociated with the stability of the world pillar that links the world mountainwith the celestial pole, the turning point of the heavens.The significance of the lion to the Alevi faith was brought home to me laterthat day when, on leaving Muska, I saw a large feline carved in relief on thewall of a single-story house. Is it possible that the lion simulacrum is linkedwith Bingöl’s role as Katar Erkri, the “Summit of the Earth”?3[index_split_058.html#filepos1045320] In China, a peak called Kulkun (in themodern Bayan Kat Mountains) was known as “King of Mountains, the summit of theearth, the supporter of heaven and the axis which touches the pole.”4[index_split_058.html#filepos1045491] Similar legends, I suspect, were onceattached to Bingöl Mountain.ARRIVAL AT MUSKAWhat I had learned the night before about our destination seemed almostunbelievable. Muska, where Idris’s friends live, is the site of Hızır Çeşmesi,the Fountain of Hızır (the Alevi form of al-Khidr), with its accompanying dreamincubation house. Although Muska is the generally used name of the village,which has a population of around 120 people, its modern Turkish name isBeşikkaya Köyü. However, this name is rarely used by the local population, sinceit was imposed on the village by Turkish authorities as part of a concertedattempt to rid the region of any kind of unwanted cultural ethnicity. I washoping we could visit the fountain, which from the few pictures I had managed toview online, looked absolutely idyllic, with the spring water emerging from thebase of an old gnarled tree.The very last of the scattering of houses making up the village ceased as we nowentered a small enclosed valley, beyond which to the east and north weremountain slopes, part of a northern extension of the Bingöl massif. I looked outon the landscape below, which seemed abundantly rich in green trees, lushmeadows, and beautiful mountain streams. It was unimaginable the differencebetween here and the more arid conditions on the plain of Mush.Getting out of the car, I saw instantly several pieces of obsidian just lyingabout on the track. I picked up a few examples as we began a walk across whatappeared to be an extended garden area. Here we navigated the outpouring of amountain brook that ran down from a plush green environment up ahead. No one wasabout as, with the sound of trickling water all around us, we entered asheltered canopy of trees at the base of the mountain valley. I recognized itimmediately as the Fountain of Hızır, which seemed absolutely bizarre, as ouractual destination was a property immediately beyond it on slightly higherground. This all seemed a little weird—Idris’s friends just happening to livenext to one of the most holy sites in Alevi tradition.FOUNTAIN OF HIZIRBefore me now stood an eight-sided column, painted canary yellow, with a spouton each facade, from which came mountain water of the purest kind. This reallywas a fountain and not a well, with the water somehow being projected throughthe column by the action of gravity. The structure was not old—fifty to seventyyears at the most—although the site was as old as the hills themselves. Therewere inscriptions in black on the column, but none offered any real words ofwisdom. One read “Hızır Çesmesi hepimizindir cevreyi temiz tutalim,” which means“Fountain of Khidr is for everyone, let’s keep the environment clean”! It wasadvice clearly taken, because the entire site was still as nature intended,although the childish graffiti scrawled into the fountain seemed unnecessary.The source of the spring was beneath an overhanging tree close by. Off to ourleft some 20 feet (6 meters) away, and sheltered by overhanging branches, wasthe building used for dream incubation. It was simple and unassuming, and forsome reason it reminded me of a waiting room on a railway station (sans the badsmells, of course).At the fountain, Idris and I sampled the water, which tasted good. It was muchneeded, and just maybe it would have some beneficial effect on our health. Itook time to take in the ambience of the place, realizing that I had been led,almost by chance, to somewhere quite special indeed.To say that this site was scenic would be to do it an injustice, for thesunlight glinting off the sparkling waters seemed almost to bring alive thesheer abundance of life that prospered here. Trees, plants, and flowers seemedto grow with an almost enchanting beauty. It was as if this place was imbibedwith the spirit of life itself, making me wonder whether this really was theMa’ul Hayat, the Fountain of Life, where al-Khidr, the genius loci of the site,was given immortality, or the Ab’i Hayat, the Waters of Life, where Alexanderthe Great achieved immortality himself following a quest that had brought himright here to Bingöl Mountain.FISH FARMJust beyond the Fountain of Hızır is, rather surprisingly, a prefabricatedfactory unit, which, it must be pointed out, blends in pretty well with theenvironment. Between it and the Fountain of Hızır is a cluster ofindustrial-sized pools, for I learned that Idris’s friends run a commercial fishfarm, a strange site perpetuation echoing the manner in which al-Khidr achievesimmortality by catching and eating a fish swimming about in the Fountain ofImmortality.Slightly uphill of both the factory unit and the Fountain of Hızır was our finaldestination—an unassuming cottage, in the garden of which introductions werequickly made. Welcoming us was the owner of the house, a tall, thin, bearded manin his sixties, who at this point I had no idea was a renowned Alevi poet andmusician named Hıdır Çelik. Youths also were present, apprentices at the fishfarm and relatives perhaps of Hıdır. A couple of men from the community greetedus, as did Hıdır’s daughter, Gülüzar, who seemed to be in her twenties.She and a female friend started to prepare salad for a meal, as black tea wasserved, and one of the youths now reappeared with a whole bag of fresh fish andstarted cooking them on a grill supported above an open fire. Gülüzar washedcutlery and glasses in the mountain brook, which actually ran through thegarden, making it clear that this was their main source of water. Neither Hıdır,his daughter, nor anyone else present other than Idris spoke English, so allconversations were in Turkish or Kurdish. At suitable moments, I took my leaveto gaze down at the Fountain of Hızır not 50 yards (46 meters) away. I watched ashepherd herding his flock of sheep along the edge of the mountain slope andwent across to the outdoor bathroom positioned on a nearby hill ridge, providingme with an opportunity to refine my collection of obsidian pieces, disgorged byBingöl Mountain when it was still an active volcano.Were pieces of obsidian like this instrumental in instigating the constructionof places like Göbekli Tepe, and through it initiating the Neolithic revolution?The earliest known mirrors are highly polished disks of obsidian found at ÇatalHöyük in southern-central Anatolia, and also at Aşıklı Höyük, aten-thousand-year-old town complex discovered in the 1960s near Aksaray incentral Turkey. I thought it fitting therefore that among the forbidden arts ofheaven that Azâzêl, one of the leaders of the Watchers, is said to have revealedto humankind was “the fabrication of mirrors, and the workmanship of braceletsand ornaments.”5 [index_split_058.html#filepos1045674]An obsidian bracelet, more than nine thousand years old, discovered at AşıklıHöyük during the 1990s, is deemed so unique that it was given special attentionby researchers from the Institut Français d’Etudes Anatoliennes in Istanbul andthe Laboratoire de Tribologie et Dynamique des Systèmes in Lyon, France.6[index_split_058.html#filepos1045831] They determined that it was made usinghighly specialized manufacturing techniques and is almost perfectly regular inshape. Additionally, they found that the symmetry of the central annular ridgeis within a degree of accuracy, while the mirrorlike surface of the braceletwould have required “the use of complex polishing techniques capable ofobtaining a nanometer-scale surface quality worthy of today’s telescopelenses.”7 [index_split_058.html#filepos1046128]Could the technique of producing finely polished obsidian mirrors and braceletshave been introduced to the early Neolithic world of central and easternAnatolia by Swiderian master craftsmen, remembered in myth and legend as theWatchers and Anunnaki, as well as the Peri of Persian and Kurdish folklore? Weresome of these individuals in fact Neanderthal human-hybrids of strikingappearance, whose original homeland was the Russian Plain, or even theCarpathian Mountains of Central Europe? It did seem possible.POETRY READINGFollowing food and a tour of the fish farm, Idris and I were given copies of theAlevi poet’s book of poems, written partly in Turkish and partly in Zâzâ, thenative language of the Alevi, who are mostly Dimli Kurds.8[index_split_058.html#filepos1046228] There were calls for Hıdır to read a poemor two, which he did in his native tongue. His words sounded emotive andmeaningful.After more tea, it was time to leave, and with the car dropped off safely inVarto, there were just moments to spare before the final dolmus departed forMush. We never did encounter the PKK on our travels, and no one seemed in anyway concerned that elsewhere in Bingöl Province, as well as in other parts ofeastern Turkey, a very real war was being waged every day, with it rarely evengetting a mention in the international media.The following morning I left Mush for Göbekli Tepe, traveling purposely by coachin order to experience the nail-biting journey through the Eastern TaurusMountains on the old obsidian route, first to Diyarbakır and then on toŞanlıurfa, where I planned to stay for the final three days of the trip. Wepassed close to the source of the Tigris River, as well as the site of Çayönü,and also Nevalı Çori, submerged by the floodwaters caused by the opening of theAtatürk Dam in 1992. We also passed within reach of Karaca Dağ, the source of somany strains of modern wheat, pinpointing this region—the heart of the triangled’or—as the true foundation point for the emergence of agriculture in the NearEast. All of these important marks on the pages of history are just a stone’sthrow away from the road between Mush and Göbekli Tepe."},{"pageContent":"41GÖBEKLI TEPE REVISITEDIfirst visited Göbekli Tepe back in 2004. Back then many of the enclosures wereeither only partially excavated or they were enclosed in temporary structureswith corrugated roofs. At the time, I had the whole place to myself andencountered only the man who owns the pastureland thereabouts, and who isacknowledged as the “discoverer” of the site. His name is Şeymus Yıldız, and inthe 1980s he kept coming across fragments of carved stone when tilling thefields, which he simply picked up and placed on boundary walls. He did reportthese finds to the archaeological museum in Şanlıurfa, but no one ever came toinspect them until the German archaeologist Dr. Klaus Schmidt turned up at thesite in 1994.Today, nearly all the pillars in the large enclosures are fully exposed, whilenew structures are being unearthed to the west and northwest of the main groupof sanctuaries. There are too many mysteries oozing from every corner of thisenigmatic archaeological site to do it justice in one book, although I knew thiswas what I would be attempting to do upon my return to the United Kingdom.After hanging around the site long enough, I did finally manage to get animpromptu interview with Klaus Schmidt, who was very forthcoming on a number ofdifferent subjects. He told me, for instance, that he does not discount thepossibility that some of the enclosures might have been built with celestial orastronomical considerations in mind. Yet he admits it is not his “favoritetheory” regarding the purpose of the sanctuaries.UNFINISHED MONOLITHOn the second day, I was able to walk out to the unfinished monolith, located ona northwest extension of the mountain ridge, a quarter of a mile (400 meters)away from the main enclosures. For the journey I was accompanied by one of KlausSchmidt’s archaeological colleagues (name withheld at his request), with whom Iwas able to discuss many aspects of the discoveries at the site.The partly hewn pillar—bigger than anything seen in the enclosures so far—hasmajor fracture lines across its surface, suggesting that the Göbekli buildersbroke it even before they had a chance to remove it from the bedrock. Mostprobably they moved on to another site elsewhere on the plateau and begancarving out a new stone there. When a finished pillar was finally freed from thebedrock it would leave behind a gaping hole. Within this, my archaeologicalfriend informed me, a fierce fire would be kindled to burn the thousands oflimestone chips that would inevitably result from fashioning a pillar of thissize. These would then be pulverized to make the fill necessary to create thebeautifully finished terrazzo floors seen in some of the sanctuaries.The bigger question left in my mind, however, was why supersize everything atthe site, especially when no one before had even attempted to create stonesanctuaries on this scale. Only the great stone wall and tower at Jericho mightbe contemporaneous with the earliest building phases of Göbekli Tepe. Furtherback in time we have only the carved stone blocks fashioned by the Solutreanpeoples to create rock friezes within the caves of southwest Europe.So why the sudden change in policy at places like Göbekli Tepe in southeastAnatolia during the tenth millennium BC? My archaeological friend suggested thatGöbekli Tepe was the culmination of a natural evolution in building constructionacross a period of thousands of years, which was also the opinion of his mentor,Klaus Schmidt. I thought differently, citing fear as the greatestmotivation—fear that something bad would happen if you didn’t do it. He didconsider the possibility before deciding to differ with me on this point.JUTTING HEADLANDAfter the archaeologist’s departure, I spent some time in the baking heatwalking out to the tip of a narrow headland that juts toward the northeast ofthe main east-west aligned mountain ridge. Although purely natural, I had asense that this promontory might have played some role in the beliefs andpractices of the Göbekli builders.The closer I got to the end of the headland, the more the flint tools thatlitter the bellylike tepe almost disappear. Either this place was completelyleft unoccupied or it was reserved for special occasions. Large, rectilinearblocks that had fractured away from the limestone bedrock had clearly beenremoved to leave a flat, rectangular enclosure that faced roughly north towardthe direction of Karaca Dağ and, of course, the stars of the northern night sky.Here the Göbekli builders could have watched Cygnus rise and set and the MilkyWay’s Great Rift form an entrance to the sky world. There was little questionthat this place possessed an ancient sanctity even more primeval than the largeenclosures on the top of the ridge, which, as the crow flies, are about a thirdof a mile (550 meters) away from this location.The only other evidence of human activity I saw was what appeared to be a smallfragment of a stone bowl, most likely from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic age. Itwould remain undisturbed until such time as the archaeologists turned theirattention to this strange place, which, I sensed, was not going to be any timesoon. It would take decades to excavate the many enclosures still to beuncovered beneath the artificial mound, and that was always going to be theirprimary focus of attention.NEW LION PILLARAs I returned to the occupational mound, I passed the square grid of 30-foot (9meter) trenches opened to the northwest of the main enclosures and caught sightof a new discovery sticking out of the ground. It was another major pillar that,even with its T-shaped termination missing, stands an impressive 7 feet (2meters) in height. On its western face is the carved relief of a leaping lion(see plate 20 [index_split_031.html#filepos433748]), occupying the same positionas the foxes on the central pillars in the enclosures forming part of the maingroup. Next to nothing is known about the enclosure that once surrounded thepillar, although presumably this great monolith stood proud as part of a pair atthe center of the structure. That the carved lion appears on its western face,directed toward the entrant approaching from the south, implies that this is theeastern pillar, its western neighbor probably still awaiting discovery somewherebeneath the compact soil and rock debris forming the surface of the mound.MIGHTY LIONSeeing this mighty lion, which was just about to be encased in wood to protectit against potential vandalism and the harsh winter ahead, made me recall thelion simulacrum crowning the summit of Bingöl Mountain and the lion of Ali,sacred to the Alevi and Yâresân. Did this carved lion on the side of a Göbeklipillar symbolize the kosmokrator, the guardian of the world pillar and keeper ofcosmic time, like the lion-headed cosmic being called Zurvan Akarana in thebranch of Zoroastrianism known as Zurvanism? Or was it yet another form of thecosmic trickster, a creature of Ahriman, the dark principle in Zoroastrianism,just like the wolf and fox? In ancient Egypt, the goddess Hathor, in her guiseas the lioness-headed Sekhmet, rained down fire on the earth and nearlydestroyed humankind when the sun god Re deemed that humankind had become “tooold,” a memory perhaps of the terrifying destruction that accompanied theYounger Dryas comet impact of 10,900 BC. Was this same leonine destructressdepicted on the newly uncovered pillar at Göbekli Tepe, or was it simply acreature encountered upon entering the sky world, perhaps a proto-form of theMesopotamian sky panther MULUD. KA.DUH.A, made up of stars belonging to Cygnusand the neighboring constellation of Cepheus (as described in chapter 8)? It istoo early to say, especially since each new pillar or porthole stone uncoveredraises even more questions about this extraordinary place.To confirm that the carving on the newly uncovered pillar was really a lion andnot some other species of quadruped, I pointed to the stone and called out,“azlan?” The two men, who were probably about 30 yards (27 meters) away, stoppedwhat they were doing, waved, and shouted back, “azlan,” which is Turkish for“lion.”I felt I was done at Göbekli Tepe. I could do no more here for the time being.Yet before leaving I vowed to come back to this place whenever time and moneywould permit, for it was clear that discoveries were being made all the time andthat I could always expect to learn something new whenever I returned to thissanctuary on the edge of Eden itself."},{"pageContent":"42A LOSS OF INNOCENCEThe following afternoon I departed for London, reaching home some twenty-fourhours later. The world for me soon returned to normal, but I could not get outof my mind one persisting image no matter what I did, even at the local gym thatweek. As I lay on a bench, using a chest machine, the hardest possible rap musicwas pumping out of the speakers, alienating me from the activities taking placein the room and somehow allowing my mind to escape this unnerving madness.I was back in Hıdır Çelik’s garden in Muska, the noise of the nearby Fountain ofHızır and the network of tiny brooks that passed through this paradise stillaudible in my ear. Golden sunlight sparkled off the running water as it trickledgently over a trail of pebbles, some of them undoubtedly pieces of polishedobsidian ejected in some former age by Bingöl Mountain itself.We had finished eating the fresh fish, cooked by the youth on an open fire, andHıdır’s daughter, Gülüzar, now gathered water from the mountain stream runningthrough the garden. These people, all Alevi by birth, seemed completely at peaceliving their lives on a mountainside, only rarely coming into contact with thepressures and tensions of the outside world. They are relatively free of thestresses and strains that come with a modern, urban existence like the one mostof us are doomed to suffer during our lives.Without even trying, these people experience a harmony with nature that allowsthem a purity of heart, and a certain sense of grace, that almost seemsreflected in the fecundity of everything that grows in and around the garden.From the trees overhanging the sacred Fountain of Hızır to the bright greenfields and meadows that fill the local landscape, and even the abundance of fishthat thrive here in the thousands, everything appears utterly awash with lifeand vitality.A SENSE OF GUILTI imagined that this was the same innocence, the same purity of heart, that musthave prevailed in the Garden of Eden before the serpent beguiled Adam and Eveinto partaking of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of God and Evil. Instantly,their innocence vanished as their eyes were opened to the fact that they werenaked. I am sure they must have noticed before that they wore no clothes, thedifference being that now they felt a sense of shame and guilt over thisinnocent act, and so covered themselves up. This was something they did,according to some accounts, by using fig leaves picked from the same tree thatthe couple had eaten from, implying that the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evilwas a fig tree,1 [index_split_058.html#filepos1046432] just like the one thatgraces the summit of Göbekli Tepe today.DEATH OF AN IDYLLIC WORLDAdam and Eve, as our First Parents, are merely metaphors for humanity as itexisted before we woke up to our “nakedness.” Before this time we had lived in astate of innocence and grace that was taken away from us, and ever since thattime we have been made to suffer and toil, not only in body, but also in spirit.The eternal golden age of hunting and foraging, when people were free toexperience life on their own terms, would appear to have been halted by acataclysm, arguably the proposed comet impact of 10,900 BC, and this changedeverything. From these ashes arose people who wanted to tell us that thinkingfor ourselves and making decisions based on our own vision of life wereessentially wrong, immoral even, and that whenever we have such thoughts weshould feel guilt and shame, exactly what happened to Adam and Eve in the Gardenof Eden. It was a form of social conditioning imposed on our ancestors by thosewho assumed control over the way the future would now be shaped in the wake ofthe Neolithic revolution.The greatest clue in this transition from a state of innocence to one of mentalentrapment is in the fact that after being expelled from Paradise, Adam and Eveare condemned to forever till the land, for as Yahweh makes clear to Adam:> > > > Cursed is the ground for your sake;> > > > In toil you shall eat of it> > > > All the days of your life . . .> > > > In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread> > > > Till you return to the ground.2 [index_split_058.html#filepos1046616]In other words, humankind began to live by the process of subsistenceagriculture, something that could only be done if everyone worked side by sidewith a more-or-less hive mentality under the control of taskmasters. No longercould we have the free lives of hunters, to do exactly what we wanted, when wewanted. People had now to exist day in, day out under regulated, and oftenconfined, working environments. From such communities, which must have suppliedthe quarry men, stone masons, knappers, carvers, butchers, and constructionworkers for the creation of places like Göbekli Tepe, came much largeragricultural centers, leading eventually to Neolithic town complexes such asÇatal Höyük and Aşıklı Höyük in central Turkey. Founded around the same timethat Göbekli Tepe was finally abandoned, ca. 8000 BC, Aşıklı Höyük was made upof a tight network of residential dwellings, workshops, and claustrophobicstreets, no wider than alleyways, where beautiful obsidian mirrors, bracelets,and necklaces were manufactured.TRAUMA AND INJURIESExactly what the work ethics might have been at Aşıklı Höyük is quite anothermatter. Skeletal remains show that men lived until they were fifty-five tofifty-seven years of age, while women lived only to the age of twenty totwenty-five years.3 [index_split_058.html#filepos1046752] Severe trauma andinjuries to the shoulders and spine indicate that these women carried heavyloads during their lives or were bending over or kneeling constantly, perhaps infront of a saddle quern used to make cereal grain. The skeletal remains of themen, on the other hand, show signs of joint disease and trauma of the type thatmight be expected from constant heavy labor, such as wood logging, constructionwork, and tilling the land.Clearly, living in the first industrial age, where everyone had to have a homeand be fed equally, took its toll on the population in a manner that might raisethe question of who exactly was in charge at Aşıklı Höyük. Curiously, oneancient tradition asserts that the forbidden fruit consumed by Adam and Eve thatbrought about the misery of the original sin was “an ear of wheat,”4[index_split_058.html#filepos1046894] emphasizing once again that theintroduction of widescale sedentary farming was at the root of humanity’s lossof innocence.> > > > In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread> > > > Till you return to the ground.No longer were we now just individuals, thinking and making decisions forourselves on behalf of our families and friends. Others now told us how tothink, what to do, when to get up, when to eat, and when we could go to sleep.Since that time, we have been unable to break free from the fear that somethingbad will happen if we deviate from this path, and ultimately there is verylittle we can do to escape this torment. Those who do try to break free of theirpsychological shackles are often vilified or persecuted as blasphemers,heretics, dropouts, or just plain lunatics.BACK TO EDENVarious religious groups and communities throughout history have realized thatthe return to Paradise, and the freedom of thought that it brings, is through asimple innocence and purity of heart, just as it was with our First Parentsbefore the time of the Fall. It is actually a good philosophy, and the strangething is that some of the most successful of these communities had theirinception in the same geographical region as that identified in this book as thetrue site of the Garden of Eden. They include the Cathars, or Albigensians, whoin the twelfth and thirteenth centuries advocated a return to a simple purity inplaces such as Italy and France. That was, of course, until they wereannihilated in the Albigensian Crusade, a mass genocide of atrocious proportionsorchestrated by the Church of Rome.The doctrine of the Cathars derived from the Bogomils, who thrived in EasternEurope during the tenth and eleventh centuries AD. Their communities grew fromexiled Christians of a semi-Gnostic nature who arrived here from the foothillsof the Armenian Highlands, north of Lake Van. Known as the Paulicians, they owedat least some of their ideas to the Arevordi, the Children of the Sun, who,although broadly classed as Armenian Zoroastrians, followed a simple faith incomplete harmony with nature.5 [index_split_058.html#filepos1047028]Unbelievably, surviving elements of all these faiths, whether Christian,Zoroastrian, or pagan, were absorbed into the indigenous religions of the Kurds,most notably the Alevi.6 [index_split_058.html#filepos1047219]A RETURN TO THE SOURCESo even though I was unable to communicate directly with the Alevi I met, theirmessage got through loud and clear. Finding Eden, ultimately, is not aboutputting pins in maps and saying, “This is it—I have found Paradise.” It is aboutan inner journey—it is about returning to the source of human experience andunderstanding exactly who we were before someone, somewhere, conditioned us tofeel guilt and shame for the first time—shame about who we are as individuals,how we should act and behave, and what we should do with our lives. This is nota declaration of anarchy or a license to do what you want. It is a call for usto try to regain some small sense of the innocence and purity of heart thatprevailed in the past, and I glimpsed just for a moment among the Alevi peoplewho still occupy the Garden of Eden today, for their world seems a happier placethan ours."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIXUSEFUL DATESThe following is a list of useful dates relating to topics discussed in thisbook.

He is theauthor of more than a dozen books that challenge the way we perceive the past.They include From the Ashes of Angels (1996), which establishes that theWatchers of the book of Enoch and the Anunnaki of the Sumerian texts are thememory of a shamanic elite that catalyzed the Neolithic revolution in the NearEast at the end of the last ice age; Gateway to Atlantis (2000), which pins downthe source of Plato’s Atlantis to the Caribbean island of Cuba and the Bahamianarchipelago; Tutankhamun: The Exodus Conspiracy (coauthored with Chris OgilvieHerald, 2002), which reveals the truth behind the discovery of Tutankhamun’sfamous tomb; and The Cygnus Mystery (2007), which shows that the constellationof Cygnus has been universally venerated as the place of first creation and theentrance to the sky world since Paleolithic times.In 2008 Andrew and colleague Nigel Skinner Simpson discovered a previouslyunrecorded cave complex beneath the pyramids of Giza, which has brought himworldwide acclaim.
