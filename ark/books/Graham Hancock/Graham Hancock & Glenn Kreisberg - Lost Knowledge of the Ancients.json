This collection of essays adds to those voices and,when taken as a whole, provides astounding, yet compelling proof of anapproaching shift in our perspective regarding human origins and the roots ofcivilization. Long-standing paradigms are beginning to crumble and realign tothis new order of thinking.This “thought revolution” represents a direct challenge to an orthodox,mainstream academic establishment that continues to try to debunk sound evidenceand theories that have not only stood the test of time but that have alreadyattained accepted status in the court of public opinion. Of course, orthodoxyresists and fights change by its very nature. Acceptance by this establishmentwould require a shift in perception regarding the knowledge that mankindpossessed in remote epochs.Why lost knowledge? Because much of the research, evidence, and theoriespresented in this collection are not currently included in mainstream,traditional academic curriculums. Nor are they seriously pursued at universitiesor published in scholastic textbooks and journals, although that is slowlychanging. The battle to have them included and accepted has stirred controversyworldwide for decades, in some cases prompting attacks by academia against thoseinvolved in this fight.Lost Knowledge of the Ancients offers the reader a selection of well researchedand thought provoking articles and essays covering alternative science andhistory. We have tried to stay within the broad theme of lost knowledge andcycles of time, while exploring nontraditional theories and perspectives thatchallenge long-standing assumptions. The diverse offerings of these prolificauthors and researchers present a unique snapshot of some of the latest findingsin cutting-edge scientific and historical research, while exploring new theoriesand fresh challenges to existing ones.By recognizing that many modern discoveries are actually rediscoveries of lostknowledge from past civilizations, the essays in this collection aim tocontextualize, within the bigger picture of human knowledge, the achievementsand events giving rise to a fundamental understanding of where our present timefits into the past and the future; into the cycle of human existence.These essays also connect the dots, so to speak, for readers who will discoverthat the whole picture adds up to more than the sum of its parts. Through thesewritings, readers will realize that many of these authors, scientists, andresearchers suggest that there is a cycle of time and consciousness thatprofoundly affects the way we look at history. Each article in this collectionarticulates something that builds on the overall theme.For example, Dr. Schoch looks at possible higher states of consciousness(telepathy, clairvoyance, and so on) in a past age, not just because he isinterested in the paranormal, but also because it adds to and builds upon hisearlier work. He finds that these phenomena have real scientific support thatbuttresses the ancient stories of a pre-Babel era when mankind communicated at ahigher level, allowing such things as building great structures long beforethere was any form of written language (heretofore considered a prerequisite to“civilization”). Edward F. Malkowski, in his essay, looks deeply at the wisdomand cosmology of ancient Egypt and finds a parallel to modern string theory andquantum physics, which wouldn’t be considered possible under the linear paradigmof history.So, as the paradigms of science and history shift (virtually on a daily basis),this committed breed of scientific researcher endeavors to break new ground andreport on remarkable discoveries and astonishing new theories and discoveries inthe fields of science, history, philosophy, and religion. Committed to standardsof scientific methodology, this collection brings to the inquisitive reader themost relevant, insightful, and startling scientific and historical informationpublished in our world today.These authors rarely write outside their fields. In fact, some of them may noteven fully realize how their work fits into the bigger picture—but by fittingall the pieces together, we now have enough knowledge and evidence totentatively confirm that what the ancients themselves told us is real: Timereally does move in a cycle, and the myths related to this cycle reveal both along-lost Golden Age, and a new one that approaches!We begin with an article by Dr. Robert Schoch, a geologist and full-time facultymember at Boston University since 1984, who is best known for his controversialredating of the Sphinx from 2500 BCE to at least 5000 BCE (and perhaps even muchearlier), based on sound geologic evidence. Entering another field, Dr. Schochwrites on examining evidence and research surrounding parapsychology and“supernatural” phenomena, shedding new light on the process of evaluating suchresearch and evidence.Author/researcher Edward F. Malkowski writes about the connection between theancient Egyptian mystery school and today’s new science philosophy, showing that“new” revelations actually shadow ancient insights.Explaining and expanding his Orion Correlation Theory, researcher/author RobertBauval demonstrates how a “Cosmic Egypt,” ghosted in the geography of the NileValley, reflects the cyclical changes in the sky landscape caused by theprecession of the equinoxes. Bauval shows how this influence over the evolutionof temple building, for over three thousand years and over a thousand miles, wasadministered by astronomer/priests of the highest order.Author Mark Booth uncovers the hidden truths behind the esoteric knowledge heldand passed down by secret societies throughout history, and in doing so opensour eyes to a new way of looking at the history of the world.Famed rebel Egyptologist John Anthony West takes on the “Church of Progress” andcalls to task the “mainstream” archaeological community in his open letter tothe editors of Archaeology magazine.Secret societies also form the basis for Richard C. Hoagland and Mike Bara’sfascinating research into the possibility of an ancient race once inhabitingMars. Hoagland claims that NASA is covering up evidence found on both the moonand Mars that proves a highly advanced, yet ancient, civilization once existedand may hold the key to the lost history of the human race.Walter Cruttenden, founder of the Binary Research Institute (an archeoastronomythink tank), explores what Plato described as the “Great Year,” a 25,000+ yearcycle based on the precession of the equinoxes, which may account for the riseand fall of civilization as well as human consciousness. Cruttenden shows howthe “myth” associated with the precession cycle pervaded all ancient cultures.Continuing on the theme of a grand cycle of time, researcher Scott Creightonoffers a convincing new theory accounting for the ground plan at Giza, Egypt,linking it to a warning of cosmic destruction encoded into a precessionalcalendar wheel clearly laid out among the temples, monuments, and pyramids ofthe Giza Plateau.Researcher Andrew Collins postulates that a cosmic burst of energy from arelatively nearby star during Paleolithic times may have boosted humanconsciousness and kick-started human religion and creativity by affectingchanges in our evolution.Speculating that the ancients may have known much more than they are givencredit for, I examine the evidence that may prove that our ancestors hadknowledge and perhaps use of the electromagnetic spectrum in ancient times.Badrinaryan Badrinaryan, chief geologist for the National Institute for OceanTechnology in India, takes us to the floor of the Gulf of Khambhat, off India’snorthwest coast. Evidence from side-scan sonar images and artifacts brought upfrom the murky depths helps build the case for a new cradle of ancientcivilization and offers us a glimpse of what the oceans are likely to give up toarchaeological explorers during the next century.Author Gary A. David reveals a remarkable correlation between the stars of theconstellation Orion and the Anasazi ground constructions in the southwest UnitedStates, not unlike the correlation found in Egypt. These careful astronomersmeticulously laid out both winter and summer solstice sunset and sunrisealignments as part of a “ley” energy system covering their territory fromsouthern Colorado through Arizona, to the mouth of the Colorado River.Italian naval engineer Flavio Barbiero makes the case for the possibility ofinstantaneous shift of the poles; a cataclysmic event that may have occurred inrelatively recent times, destroying a once flourishing civilization whose ruins,providing evidence of the shift, now lie buried under the ice sheets ofAntarctica.And last, Graham Hancock offers us startling new evidence about those who firstpeopled the Americas and where and when they came from.In all, it’s a fascinating collection of articles and essays meant to widen ourperspective, expand our horizons of knowledge, and speak to the mysteries thatdrive the human heart and mind to explore and discover new truths about thehuman condition we all share.At present, it’s being reported around the world that former NASA astronaut Dr.Edgar Mitchell, who flew the Apollo 14 mission and was the sixth human to walkon the moon, announced that the United States government has been covering up asixty-year-old incident involving human contact with intelligentextraterrestrial aliens. Dr. Mitchell holds doctorates of science inastronautics and aeronautics and worked at NASA for decades. He claims hisreport is based on inside information and years of firsthand evidence. Thiscan’t be easily disputed, nor can it be dismissed out of hand—yet it fails togain any real traction as a credible news story in today’s world.NASA, the “official establishment,” issued a response disagreeing with Dr.Mitchell’s “opinion.” NASA did not acknowledge that Dr. Mitchell was notexpressing an opinion, he was relating a fact. Along with many of thecontributors to this book, he may be proven right over time, simply by the factsthey’ve stated. Fifty, one hundred, five hundred, or a thousand years from now,when historians are writing the history of our present time, they will no doubtacknowledge the few visionary researchers and writers who got it right andworked to bring forbidden knowledge and new insights to the attention of theworld."},{"pageContent":"O N ETHOUGHTS ON PARAPSYCHOLOGY AND PARANORMAL PHENOMENAHAS CONVENTIONAL SCIENCE MISSED SOMETHING PROFOUND?ROBERT M. SCHOCH, PH.D.Many of you reading this piece may know me from my work on the Great Sphinx, theGreat Pyramid, and other ancient monuments, as discussed in various articles,documentary videos, and the books that I have written. As such, I am commonlyasked how my studies in parapsychology relate, if at all, to my studies ofancient monuments. Even though I am a geologist, and my initial concern is indating various ancient structures, I can’t help but wonder why they were built,especially given the enormous efforts that must have gone into theirconstruction.The “why” behind the monuments, more often than not, apparently includedmotivating factors such as religious beliefs and practices, initiation rites,and rituals, which in many cases seemed to have an ostensible paranormal aspect,whether it was clairvoyance, divination, or manifestations of higher levels ofconsciousness. The temples and tombs of ancient Egypt, Mexico, and Peru seem tocry out “paranormal.” So, was it all a mixture of ancient myth, superstition,and downright fraud on the part of many a seer, seeress, priest, and priestess,or could there have been something to it? Were the ancient structures used, atleast in part, to alter consciousness, and possibly enhance paranormalphenomena?In all honesty, I have always been highly skeptical of any alleged paranormalphenomena. However, my concept of skepticism is not the same as dismissal, andin my studies of ancient, indigenous, and traditional cultures, allegedparanormal phenomena kept making an appearance. When Logan Yonavjak, a formerBoston University student of mine, encouraged me to delve deeply into theserious parapsychological literature, I found the topic both fascinating andenlightening. The immediately tangible result of our research was the book wewrote together entitled The Parapsychology Revolution, in which we includedselections from fourteen seminal papers, dating from 1886 through 2007, by majorfigures in the field, as well as a hundred pages of our own commentary. For me,however, the real result of my immersion into parapsychology was a newappreciation for human potentiality and the connections we share with all oflife and ultimately, perhaps, with the cosmos.ARE PARANORMAL PHENOMENA REAL?People often ask me if I “believe” in the paranormal. Let me just say that afterlooking at the hard evidence, and sifting out the fraud and bunk, I have come toconclude that there definitely is something to such phenomena as telepathy andpsychokinesis.Most people who have seriously studied the subject conclude that telepathy (mindto mind interaction) is the best-supported class of paranormal phenomena. Thereis strong laboratory evidence for telepathy, such as classic card-callingexperiments, as well as many more sophisticated tests of telepathy,clairvoyance, and remote viewing. There is also a large and compelling body ofevidence from spontaneous cases supporting the reality of telepathy. Forinstance, crisis apparitions, veridical hallucinations, or “ghosts” are wellknown, as documented in the classic two-volume scientific monograph ofrigorously authenticated events produced by the Society for Psychical Researchtitled Phantasms of the Living.The evidence for psychokinesis is also strong, including micro-psychokinesisstudies using random event generators and similar devices. Examples of thisevidence include the work done by the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research(PEAR) labs over more than a quarter of a century, and the carefully studiedincidents of macro-psychokinesis associated with genuine spontaneous poltergeistcases. Another line of compelling evidence for the reality of paranormalphenomena is the study of presentiments or “presponses,” essentially a form ofshort-term precognition as measured by physiological parameters (heart rate,electrodermal activity, and so forth). Numerous replicated experiments havedemonstrated the physiological responses of individuals to, for instance,disturbing photographs a second or two before they are actually viewed by theperson. According to conventional science, this should not be possible.As a natural scientist, I expect genuine phenomena (be they psychic andparanormal, or more conventional phenomena) to exhibit patterns and shareelements in common, and this is just what has been found in spontaneous cases ofthe paranormal. Even when viewed cross-culturally, such commonalities persist.Perhaps even more compelling for me is the work of various modern researchersthat has demonstrated a weak but persistent correlation between low levels ofgeomagnetic activity on planet Earth and cases of apparent spontaneous telepathy(based on records going back to the latter half of the nineteenth century).This, in my opinion, is a very strong argument supporting the contention thatthere is something genuine to the concept of telepathy. It suggests thatspontaneous telepathic phenomena are real and natural and, as might be expectedof natural phenomena, that their manifestation is influenced by other naturalparameters.Alternatively, are we to hypothesize that hundreds of hoaxers over nearly acentury and a half have conspired to fake telepathic incidents in identicalcorrelation with geomagnetic activity? This latter hypothesis strikes me asrather far-fetched, if not downright ludicrous. It has also been found thatincidents of the paranormal correlate with local sidereal time (which relates tothe position of the horizon at any particular point on Earth relative to thecenter of our galaxy).Note that a correlation between geomagnetic activity and spontaneous telepathydoes not necessarily imply that the “telepathic signal” is magnetic orelectrical in nature. The human brain is influenced by magnetic and electricfields, and whatever may be the carrier of the telepathic signal, thetransmission, reception, and manifestation of the message by the brain could behampered or enhanced by differences in the magnetic and electric fields that thebrain is subjected to.For many people, a phenomenon is not “real” unless it can be duplicated in alaboratory setting under controlled conditions. Being a natural scientist andfield geologist, I have never agreed with this contention. After all, can wecreate a genuine volcanic eruption in the laboratory or even on command in thefield? Until about two centuries ago, the scientific community routinelyrejected the concept of rocks falling from the sky (meteorites). Still,attempting to induce, capture, observe, and experiment with apparent telepathyunder controlled conditions is a worthy endeavor. Unfortunately, however, it isfraught with problems to this day, and though numerous experiments have testedpositive for apparent telepathy, others have had negative results, andreplication is a persistent problem. The bottom line is that we really do notknow exactly what parameters or variables make for good telepathic transfer (orthe elicitation of other types of paranormal phenomena), much less how tocontrol for them.There are major issues that remain unresolved concerning paranormal and psychicphenomena. We don’t fully understand what conditions are best to elicitparanormal phenomena, and thus these phenomena are not easily replicated oncommand (such as in a laboratory setting). There is often a very low signal tonoise ratio when it comes to psychic phenomena; there is no single physicaltheory to account for paranormal phenomena; and there is the issue of fraud andcharlatans. Fraud is a very real and persistent problem in the field ofpsychical research, and one of the reasons to undertake large statisticalstudies of average people (as opposed to so-called psychic superstars) andsearch for the regularities and patterns one would expect among any genuinenatural phenomena.Also, paranormal studies have extended to animals (and in some cases, evenplants). One of the strengths of nonhuman studies is that it is highlyimprobable that animals will cheat and lie. It can also be noted that many“powerful mediums” who appear to have genuine paranormal abilities alsoapparently have low moral values and will cheat and commit fraud (perhapsunconsciously) at times, especially when their genuine paranormal powers fail.This is a pattern that has been noted over and over among parapsychologistsworking with human subjects.THE HUMAN AND COSMIC PSYCHESpeculations on Precessional Ages, the Yuga Cycle, and the Mental Abilities ofAncient PeoplesMany cultures and societies have traditions that hold that history is cyclical,which is expressed in numerous ways. For example, the classical notion of Gold,Silver, Bronze, and Iron Ages; the sequence of the twelve zodiacal precessionalages that make up the Great Year; or the yuga cycle of Hindu philosophy. What, Ihave to ask myself, if there is some truth to such cycles? Has humanconsciousness, perhaps expressed in terms of different mental (and paranormal)abilities and priorities, varied with such cycles? If so, can we discernevidence of such changes in the historical and prehistoric record? Initially Iwas highly skeptical that there could be any reality to “world ages,” but as Istudy the data, I’m not so sure.The evidence of the ancient monuments, combined with the mythology*1[../Text/ch21.html#anchor_1974_0] clearly indicates that a knowledge of theprecessional cycle†2 [../Text/ch21.html#anchor_1976_0] was well known throughoutthe ancient world as far back as five thousand years ago, and maybe muchearlier. Accounts in the Judeo-Christian Bible, motifs of Egyptian art andarchitecture, and themes found among Greco-Roman myths (to name just a fewexamples) reflect precessional changes.We are now in the end of the Age of Pisces, the age that began some two thousandyears ago, not merely coincidentally with the birth of a new religion(Christianity) that adopted the fish (Pisces) as one of its earliest symbols.Soon we will enter the much-ballyhooed Age of Aquarius. Working back in timeprior to the Age of Pisces, we have the Ages of Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer,Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, and Capricorn, and then an earlier Ageof Aquarius (and the entire cycle repeats again, and again, and again).Hindu tradition has the yuga cycle, consisting of Satya Yuga (also known as theKrita Yuga; roughly a Golden Age), Treta Yuga (Silver Age), Dwapara (Dvapara)Yuga (Bronze Age), and Kali Yuga (Iron Age). (Note that these ages in the Hindusystem vary in length among themselves.) In the late nineteenth century, SwamiSri Yukteswar Giri suggested that one entire yuga cycle takes approximately24,000 years (descending from the Satya Yuga down to the Kali Yuga, and thenceascending through the yugas to another Satya Yuga, a pattern which repeats overand over) and is tied to the precessional cycle, which, in turn, is due to oursun revolving around another star. According to Sri Yukteswar, Earth left thelast Kali Yuga circa 1699 CE, and we are thus currently in the first centuriesof a Dwapara Yuga. Furthermore, he also asserted that Earth is subjected tovarying magnetic fields and other influences and energies as it travels throughspace, affecting the mental attributes of those who inhabit the planet.Approximately 15,000 years ago, Earth was at the beginning of the precessionalAge of Virgo (using the Western classical system, and depending on the exactpoint used to separate the Age of Virgo from the preceding Age of Libra). UsingSri Yukteswar’s dating of the yugas, 15,000 years ago Earth was in the SatyaYuga (“Golden Age”). What was happening 15,000 years ago on Earth? It was theend of the last ice age, but that did not mean the entire planet was covered inice—many areas were still temperate to tropical. Our ancestors, modern humans(Homo sapiens) inhabited the planet, but we were not alone in terms of human andhumanlike species.The diminutive species Homo floresiensis lived in what is now modern Indonesia.An adult H. floresiensis stood about three and a half feet tall and had a brainonly the size of a modern chimpanzee brain (not much larger than one-fourth thesize of the modern human brain on average). Yet, despite their small brainsoverall, there is evidence that the portion of the brain associated withself-awareness is approximately the same size in H. floresiensis as in H.sapiens. Self-awareness, it can be argued, is an attribute that one would expectboth in the Golden Age of the Satya Yuga and the precessional Age of Virgo sinceVirgo, ruled by Mercury, is associated with mental activity.Fifteen thousand years ago in southern Africa lived another species, technicallyknown as Homo capensis, so-named in 1918 on the basis of a partial skull (notethat there is disagreement as to whether or not these forms represent a speciesdistinct from us). More commonly they are referred to as the Boskop people orBoskops. Though their bodies were about the same size as those of modern humans,Boskops had huge heads with brains 25 to 35 percent larger than those of modernhumans. In their book Big Brain: The Origins and Future of Human Intelligence,neuroscientists Gary Lynch and Richard Granger argue that Boskops were in factmore intelligent than modern humans. Increased brain activity and enhancedlevels of consciousness (perhaps expressed in manifestations that we would deemas paranormal) may have characterized the Boskops; this would seem to fit wellwith both the Satya Yuga and the Age of Virgo. Is this just coincidence? Or isthis correlation significant?SCIENCE AND PARANORMAL PHENOMENAA popular approach to possible paranormal phenomena is to simply dismiss suchthings as impossible—impossible either in an absolute sense, or as being of sucha “low probability” as to be unworthy of consideration. For example, SeanCarroll, senior research associate in physics at the California Institute ofTechnology, posted a diatribe against parapsychologists and the very idea ofstudying possible paranormal phenomena on his blog at Discover magazine’s“Cosmic Variance” site. The core of his argument is as follows: “The main pointhere is that, while there are certainly many things that modern science does notunderstand, there are also many things that it does understand, and those thingssimply do not allow for telekinesis, telepathy, etc. Which is not to say that wecan prove those things aren’t real. We can’t, but that is a completely worthlessstatement, as science never proves anything; that’s simply not how scienceworks. Rather, it accumulates empirical evidence for or against varioushypotheses.” [Italics in the original.]I’m classically trained in the sciences, and I understand where Carroll iscoming from philosophically when he states that “science never proves anything”(and I agree that, epistemologically, at a deep level, proof is not the domainof science). However, Carroll contradicts himself when he states: “The crucialconcept here is that, in the modern framework of fundamental physics, not onlydo we know certain things, but we have a very precise understanding of thelimits of our reliable knowledge. We understand, in other words, that whilesurprises will undoubtedly arise (as scientists, that’s what we all hope for),there are certain classes of experiments that are guaranteed not to giveexciting results—essentially because the same or equivalent experiments havealready been performed.” [Italics in the original.]Here Carroll is clearly, and for all practical purposes, arguing that certainthings have been “proven” when he asserts that “we know certain things.” Thisstrikes me as a modern version of the famous (and famously wrong) 1894pronouncement made by Albert A. Michelson (later to become a Nobel laureate inphysics), quoted in an article in Natural History by Neil deGrasse Tyson titled“The Beginning of Science”: “The more important fundamental laws and facts ofphysical science have all been discovered, and these are now so firmlyestablished that the possibility of their ever being supplanted in consequenceof new discoveries is exceedingly remote. . . . Future discoveries must belooked for in the sixth place of decimals.”Michelson made this statement before the elucidation of X-rays and the structureof the atom, and before the discovery of radioactivity and the development ofquantum physics and relativity theory. Despite his scientific brilliance,Michelson did not prove himself a very good diviner of the future.Returning to the quotation from Sean Carroll, he states: “The main point here isthat, while there are certainly many things that modern science does notunderstand, there are also many things that it does understand, and those thingssimply do not allow for telekinesis, telepathy, etc.”If in place of “telekinesis, telepathy,” we substitute “continental drift,” Icould easily imagine this statement being made in the early twentieth century.The very concept of moving continents was lambasted from some quarters, despitethe strong evidence in support of the theory, because it was deemed “impossible”and utterly “inconceivable” based on the science of the time that continentscould move. There was no known mechanism, until, that is, the development ofplate tectonic theory. (Yes, as a geologist, I am aware of the variouscriticisms and possible shortcomings of tectonic theory, but that is not thepoint or issue here.)In analyzing further the selected quotations from Sean Carroll, we see that theyactually expose the weaknesses of like-minded individuals who insist thatscience in its modern Western guise should have the last word or, to put itanother way, be the final arbiter of truth (even if only a provisional truth).Again, the Carroll quotation is: “The main point here is that, while there arecertainly many things that modern science does not understand, there are alsomany things that it does understand, and those things simply do not allow forphenomena such as telekinesis, telepathy, etc. Which is not to say that we canprove those things aren’t real. We can’t, but that is a completely worthlessstatement, as science never proves anything; that’s simply not how scienceworks. Rather, it accumulates empirical evidence for or against varioushypotheses.”To say that something is “worthless” is a value judgment, and in an ultimatesense, one can argue, value judgments are outside of the realm of science anddependent on an emotional investment and context, among other factors. I wouldargue that the fact that “science never proves anything” is quite valuable as itprecludes the “sleight-of-hand” dismissal of the very possibility of anysupposed paranormal phenomena ever being genuine.As far as empirical evidence is concerned, for many people this is the heart ofthe issue when it comes to alleged paranormal phenomena. Exactly what isevidence? Are anecdotal case studies evidence? Is it appropriate to pick andchoose what we consider evidence and dismiss, as “nonevidence,” case historiesand studies that do not suit our biases? Is it legitimate for certain criticsand debunkers to reject as evidence experiments carried out by particularlaboratories, which give positive results for telepathy (with good controls, andtaking all possible precautions against possible fraud)? Yet these same criticsand debunkers will hail as “solid evidence” against the telepathic hypothesissimilar experiments in a comparable lab, which give negative results (whatever“comparable” is in such cases, given how poorly we understand the aspects thatinfluence paranormal phenomena).In fact, what is and is not “empirical evidence” is not a black and whitematter, either in parapsychology or in many other scientific disciplines. Ratherevidence, any evidence, is a matter of degree and also carries a subjective andvalue-based component. The criteria that make for convincing evidence on thepart of one person are not necessarily the same as the criteria for anotherperson. Precluding obvious fraud and the like, there is no single magicalscientific way to “objectively” determine the ultimate value of any particularalleged evidence. Science, any science, is not quite as “objective” as somewould assert."},{"pageContent":"T W OQUANTUM PHILOSOPHY AND THE ANCIENT MYSTERY SCHOOLTODAY'S NEW SCIENCE PHILOSOPHY—OLD OR NEW?EDWARD F. MALKOWSKIResponsible for the microelectronic technology that brought us the cell phone,the computer, and the Internet, quantum physics has proven to be history’s mostsuccessful scientific theory. Quantum physics is also the source of a newunderstanding of the world around us.Although the founding principles of quantum physics were developed in the 1920sand 1930s, it wasn’t until the 1970s that its influence seeped into our culturalworldview. In 1975, with the endorsement from one of quantum physics’ foundingtheorists, Nobel laureate Werner Heisenberg, Fritjof Capra explored thesimilarities between quantum physics and the Eastern mystical tradition in TheTao of Physics. Another landmark book was published four years later, GaryZukav’s The Dancing Wu Li Masters: An Overview of the New Physics. With thesebooks, and many others that followed, a new worldview started to emerge,embracing the interconnectedness between man and nature.Everything is connected through a universal field of virtual particles, and weare all part of a single living system. What this new worldview suggests is thatphysical form as biological consciousness is a local expression of a universalphenomenon commonly referred to as “consciousness.” The cycle of life and theevolution of form are natural processes that create a framework for experiencewhere consciousness is a fundamental aspect of reality just as much as thespatial dimensions. Consciousness, once thought to be only the product of brainchemistry, is now viewed as the eternal driving force for all that exists, thatmanifests itself through physical form in order to experience.Although Mind is very much an enigmatic and highly debatable concept, this newworldview also suggests that the individual’s mind is a process of thisuniversal drive to experience, as opposed to being a separate entity. ErwinSchrödinger, another founding theorist of quantum physics, and also a Nobellaureate, views this question of one Mind and many minds as an arithmeticalproblem. For Schrödinger, our perception is scientifically indescribable,because the mind itself is that world picture. Thus, the individual mind isidentical to the whole “Mind,” and therefore cannot be contained in it as a partof it. This creates a problem, because there are a multitude of individualsexperiencing consciousness, but there is only one world.One answer to this paradox is that each of us experiences a unique world, whichSchrödinger summarily dismisses. There is only one other alternative. Themultiplicity of minds is only apparent; in truth there is only a single Mind.Such a concept brings with it complex ramifications for the definition andnature of knowledge.SECRET WISDOM—SACRED SCIENCEYou might think that since quantum physics is a relatively new branch ofscience, this burgeoning “new science” philosophy is also new. It is not. Thesenew insights into nature and reality are very old but have been masked by modernattempts to characterize the ancient Egyptian culture and religion as primitive.The concepts of mind and consciousness, as well as reincarnation and evolution,were expressed long ago in what historians have labeled the “ancient mysteryschool”—what Schwaller de Lubicz termed “sacred science.” Although shrouded bythe secrecy of the temple and rites of initiation, ancient Egyptian schoolstaught this secret wisdom through myth and symbolism, an approach that leads toan understanding of the world that is virtually identical to today’s new sciencephilosophy.In fact, the sacred science of the ancient Egyptians, best described as aphilosophy of nature’s principles, inspired the Hebrews, the Greeks, the Romans,and the Christians, which led to the emergence of what we call Westerncivilization—but for us, thousands of years later, the founding knowledge of ourcivilization is all but lost. However, there have always been people who havehanded down the secret wisdom and the sacred science of the ancient Egyptians:Kabbalists, Hermeticists, Gnostics, Sufis, Buddhists, and Alchemists. It issecret only in the sense that this wisdom must be understood through esotericismand symbol, and it’s sacred only in the sense that scientific investigationinevitably leads to an understanding of Man, Divinity, and a unique knowledge of“Self.”Leaving behind modern biases and looking deep into ancient Egypt’s civilization,there can be found a brilliance and understanding that rivals our knowledgetoday. Their “gods” were of a different order than our Western concept of God.They were not “gods” at all, but principles of nature that represented conceptslike digestion and respiration. They also represented intangible qualities foundin mankind, such as knowledge and personality. This ancient view of nature hasbeen mistaken as religious and cultlike, but is, in fact, technical andphilosophical.For example, the king’s diadem, with its serpent and vulture, symbolized theprinciples of life and form. The serpent represented the concept of the Sourcefor all that exists and its manifestation as the cosmos; and the vulture, man’sspiritual immortality. Like a spirit, the vulture, soaring high in the sky,escapes this world to an existence beyond the bounds of Earth. Thus, thepharaoh’s diadem symbolized man’s kingship in a cosmic sense and the mystery oflife’s essence, where the mystery is the reality of Cause and Effect. Thismystery, which defines the human experience, is abstract, but operates throughthe concrete court of three dimensions to create another abstraction—what weexperience as consciousness and self-perception.How the ancient Egyptians developed such a refined philosophy is a mystery initself. Scholars such as Samuel Mercer, who translated Saqqara’s Pyramid Textsduring the 1950s, have noted that the tenets of this philosophy appear to haveemerged fully-fledged nearly five thousand years ago, without historicalprecedent. It is ironic that ancient Egypt’s technical capabilities—soambitious, so precise—also appear to have emerged, fully-fledged, withoutprecedent. Although we shouldn’t be surprised, since the development of asophisticated philosophy does not occur without sophisticated technology.Such insight into ancient Egypt’s earliest traditions moistens the seeds ofdoubt for history’s linear model of man and civilization— particularly so whentoday’s emerging “new science” philosophy parallels concepts described long agoin Ramses’ Temple of AmunMut-Khonsu, so meticulously described by Schwaller deLubicz in his two volume work The Temple of Man.In 1937, alchemist and Hermetic philosopher René A. Schwaller de Lubicz wasdrawn to Egypt by an inscription at the tomb of Ramses where the pharaoh wasdepicted as the side of a right (3:4:5) triangle. For Schwaller de Lubicz, thismeant that the ancient Egyptians understood geometry’s Pythagorean theorem longbefore Pythagoras was born. Intrigued, he moved to Luxor and studied ancientEgypt’s art and architecture for thirteen years, concluding that the templearchitecture was a deliberate exercise in proportion. The temple, in its detail,described the nature of man as a science, a philosophy that Schwaller de Lubicztermed the “Anthropocosm” or “Man Cosmos.”PHILOSOPHY OF THE ANTHROPOCOSMThe question of who we are and why we are here will likely remain the ultimatemystery. Intuitively, however, this mystery can be understood upon therealization that our existence as a conscious biological form can be traced tocosmic events, and that the prerequisites for our existence can be traced to auniversal state. Our Earth is dependent on the sun and the solar system in whichit is gravitationally trapped; which is dependent on the Milky Way galaxy, inwhich it is gravitationally trapped; which is also held in place by other forcesincluding, but not limited to, our neighboring galaxies. Any interruption inthis line of cosmic dependency would likely result in the cessation of ourexistence. Thus, it can be said that the cosmos is the true nature of man, andform is the sole means of its expression.Although it seems as though we are insignificantly small compared to the rest ofthe universe, there is a single truth to our existence that cannot be denied andthat lends credence to the abstract nature of man—the reality of the observer.We observe and perceive an ordered, yet dynamic, arrangement of energy that wenaturally translate into sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. To take away themeasures of this reality means reality’s destruction, which suggests that theuniverse was never concrete in the first place. We only perceive that it is.Therefore, like Plato in his cave, we can conclude that the concreteness andform in which we live are really only the knowledge of such things. Einsteinagreed implicitly in one of his famous statements: “Reality is an illusion,albeit a very persistent one.”The most interesting question is, where does our ability to observe and perceivecome from? According to physicists, it comes from an event called “state vectorcollapse” where all possible states of the system (the universe) collapse into asingle observed state.During the 1920s, while Heisenberg and Bohr were further developing quantumtheory, they realized that a new viewpoint had to be created to achieve a properunderstanding of the quantum world. The classical view of a discrete world wouldsimply not work. To accomplish this, they embraced the idea that the world isfundamentally not a collection of discrete objects, but an indistinct, unifiedworld of energy where, at times, discrete objects are perceived. Heisenbergdeveloped his wave matrix theory, and Schrödinger his wave mechanics, to explaintheir insights. Although slightly different in their approach, these twotheories offered a more accurate description of the atomic structure than didclassical physics.What their theories state is that all matter exists as a wave structure that wecannot directly see. What we do see is the localization of the wave structurewith its release of energy, which is a simple way to explain state vectorcollapse. The energy released is what physicists call a photon (a particle oflight). We perceive the released energy as a particle, even though it is reallya wave. This occurs for us because that is how the human brain works.Without state vector collapse there would be no perception of separation, noform to experience and, consequently, no expression. The cosmos would remain inan undefined state of absoluteness, a potential of all cosmic possibilities.All matter that makes up the cosmos is actually configured energy that nowexists as a result of stellar nucleosynthesis and supernova. Carbon, nitrogen,oxygen, and other heavy elements—the building blocks of life—were created as aresult of large stars collapsing under their own weight and then exploding withtremendous heat, spreading newly created elements into empty space to forminterstellar clouds. New research suggests that even amino acids, important forprotein synthesis, were formed in interstellar clouds. Thus, scientists arguethat since the elements that make up our bodies are the results of a cosmicprocess, then we are made from stardust and are literally children of the stars.The Big Bang origin of the universe has been the model of choice forcosmologists for many decades now, but it has always been a scientific paradox.Our known laws of physics are not valid until after the moment of the Big Bang.So, how do we arrive at a universe that we experience, which sprang fromnothing? Perhaps the Big Bang is only a perspective to explain the current bodyof scientific data, and does not accurately represent actual events. As is allof nature, perhaps the universe is cyclical and oscillates between thenever-ending destruction and creation of galaxies. No one really knows.However, what we do know and can be certain of is our conscious experience. Itis the one thing all six billion of us can agree upon, and the key tounderstanding nature. According to the Anthropocosm theory, consciousnesscreates a venue in order to experience, and does so through the uniquequantification of its qualities. This cosmic and anthropic “new science”understanding of man puts forth the same principles that were built into thearchitecture of Luxor’s Temple of Amun-Mut-Khonsu.The temple was not about the piety of a man, but our solar legacy as thephilosophical “Divine Man” portrayed in the great statues of Ramses—the birth ofthe sun. The temple was (and is) a form of communication, a lesson, and at itscore its builders’ philosophy is carved in stone. Amun, Mut, and Khonsu were not“gods” in the Western religious sense, but principles that form and explain thenature of mankind as coherently as such an abstract subject can be explained.The definition of man and the story of the human experience were built into thetemple architecture. Physically, the temple describes the structure of man, fromthe importance of the femur in the creation of blood cells, to the role of thepineal gland in the brain. Spiritually, the temple conveys life’s cosmic dramaand man’s spiritual immortality. Amun was the “Hidden One” or the “InvisibleOne,” best described today as the Western concept of God, omnipotent andomnipresent, or, from a scientific viewpoint, the energy field that pervades allthat exists. From the ancient Egyptian point of view, Amun was self-created, thecreative power and source for all that exists. Mut, which means “mother,” wasAmun’s cosmic wife and the mother of the “Son” Khonsu, who represented the king.However, the kingship of Khonsu was not a physical kingship but refers to acosmic (or spiritual) ruler made flesh through the principles of nature. Thus,Khonsu the King represents the essence of mankind—the archetypal “Man”—andessence of all who ever lived, is alive now, and will live in the future.Khonsu, by being associated with Re and Thoth, represented the essence of life’senergy and man’s wisdom and knowledge, where mankind is a consequence of theuniverse’s evolution culminating in the physical endowment of the universe’sself-perception. In myth, Khonsu was a lover of games, but was also theprinciple of healing, conception, and childbirth. Literally, he was “the king’splacenta.”Just as the ancient Uroboros—the circular serpent biting its tail—symbolizescyclicality, through our modern scientific endeavors we have come full circle inunderstanding ourselves. No one knows for sure in what culture or at what timethe Uroboros was first fashioned as a symbol, but it is one of mankind’s mostancient ones.Plato tells us in the Timaeus that since nothing outside of the serpent existed,it was self-sufficient. Movement was right for his spherical structure, so hewas made to move in a circular manner. Thus, as a result of his own limitations,he revolves in a circle, and from this motion the universe was created. FromEgypt’s Ptolemaic period, the artist who drew the “Chrysopoeia [gold making] ofCleopatra” wrote within the circular serpent: The All Is One. Thus, the serpentis the ancient Egyptian symbol depicting self-creation and the source of life:“It slays, weds, and impregnates itself,” writes Erich Neumann in The Origin andHistory of Consciousness. “It is man and woman, beginning and conceiving,devouring and giving birth, active and passive, above and below, at once.”For the ancient Egyptians, the Uroboros—the serpent—represents the creativeprinciple of the cosmos, as well as the cosmos itself. Since the serpent’s formis singular, without appendages, but has a forked tongue and forked penis, itsform is an apt symbol of creation’s initial movement from an undifferentiatedstate into a world of multiplicity; a movement from one to two. Schwaller refersto this as the “Primordial Scission.”The Uroboros, however, is not just an ancient mythical symbol, nor is it thefabricated imagery of the primitive mind. Rather, it is man’s identificationwith the seamless, eternal state of oneness whose essence is a deep memory of anorigin that words cannot explain and has to be understood through esotericism.As such, the Uroboros’ esotericism is as valid today as it was at the dawn ofman.THE SPIRITUAL TECHNOLOGY OF ANCIENT EGYPTThe Western worldview has a long history of separating the physical from theconceptual; the scientific from the religious. So together, spirituality andtechnology appear contradictory. This contradiction, however, is based on anaïve and exoteric view of “spirit” and “technology.”Spirit is not some immeasurable, metaphysical thing. Rather, Spirit is thedriving force behind the human experience, the quest for knowledge, and thebuilding power of civilization that can be measured by achievement. Technologyis mankind’s application of knowledge into industry that provides for thecivilization’s well being. Technology, which is the application of science intocivil practicalities, is also the building power of civilization.Even though technology’s final product is most evident, it is the spirit of manthat turns ideas into concepts, and concepts into knowledge, which throughengineering brilliance, turns science into technology and makes life moreefficient and comfortable. Every product ever made began with someone’sinspiration and creativity. So, spirit and technology are really differentaspects of the same human endeavor.The desire to know inspires us, and the ever-increasing level of knowledge andtechnology has allowed us to reach new levels in understanding our state ofexistence—but what might have inspired the ancient Egyptians? Schwaller deLubicz believed that ancient Egypt was the legacy of a technical civilization ofwhich there is no history or knowledge in today’s world, a civilization forwhich spirit and technology were integrated into a worldview that embracedlife’s mystery. For me, it is this technical and spiritual legacy that is soevident in the art and culture of ancient Egypt.The spiritual technology of ancient Egypt expounds upon the works of Schwallerde Lubicz and tells the untold story behind the birth of the Western religioustradition. The Egyptian Mysteries, as they were called, inspired greatness inmen who instilled the concept of the Anthropocosm into our own sacredliterature, and it is the same philosophical understanding of nature that is atthe forefront of today’s “new science”; whether symbolized by the Uroboros orSchrödinger’s wave equation, human consciousness exists as a local manifestationof a self-perceiving universe."},{"pageContent":"T H R E ETHE EGYPT CODEIS THE KEY TO EGYPT'S PAST REFLECTED IN THE STARS ABOVE GIZA?ROBERT BAUVALWhat are Egypt’s Old Kingdom pyramids for? What possible purpose could they havehad? Why do they have low protracted tunnels, and long narrow shafts that seemto lead nowhere, and corridors, galleries, and chambers that are often stark andempty? Why were the pyramids astronomically aligned to the stars? Why are theyscattered in clusters along a forty-kilometer strip of desert? And, moreintriguingly, why are some devoid of texts while others have their walls fullycovered with inscriptions that speak of the sun and stars, and of a strangereligious cosmology in a celestial landscape that is reminiscent of Egyptitself?Until very recently, the standard theory offered by Egyptologists was that thepyramids were tombs, large sepulchers created principally to house the body ofdead kings. As for their elaborate internal systems of tunnels, shafts,corridors, and chambers, these were intended mainly to confuse and outsmart tombrobbers, while their astronomical alignments were either meaningless or just afluke. Amazingly, such views went mostly unchallenged for nearly two centuries,this in spite of the maddening detail that no bodies of kings (not a skeleton orskull or even a bone splinter) were ever found inside a pyramid or, for thatmatter, outside it.More maddening still, no one had an explanation why, if they were “tombs,” thesepyramids were not placed into a single well-defined cemetery but instead werescattered in small clusters in a vast desert plain west of the strange, RiverNile–like volcanic islands in a sea of sand. Yet, oddly enough, the clues thatsuggested a much higher purpose than just “tombs” were plentiful, and alwaysthere for all to see and evaluate—and these clues screamed of a connection withthe stars. For example:The base of each pyramid was aligned to the astronomical directions using staralignments.The largest of the pyramids contained “air shafts” oriented toward importantstar systems such as Orion, Sirius, and the circumpolar constellations (viz. thePyramid of Khufu at Giza).Pyramids were given “star” names or names implicit of stars (“The Pyramid ofDjedefre is a Sehedu star”; “Nebka is a star”; “Horus is the star at the head ofthe sky,” and so forth).Pyramids had ceilings of chambers decorated with five-pointed stars (viz. theStep Pyramid and Fifth and Sixth Dynasty pyramids at Saqqara).Pyramids contained writings carved on the inside walls that spoke of a starreligion and the destiny of a king in a starry world called the Duat, whichcontained Orion and other constellations (viz. the Fifth and Sixth Dynastypyramids at Saqqara).It is therefore somewhat odd, not to say perverse, that with so many “stellar”connections, there has not been a single Egyptologist who was compelled enoughto consider a stellar “function” for the pyramids. And because this importantmatter was left unbridled for so long, it was not surprising that untrainedresearchers, dilettantes, cranks, and charlatans dished out theories that rangedfrom the derisory to the completely insane. Pyramids were built by the lostcivilization of Atlantis; they were built by a lost technology using levitation;they were power plants; they were electromagnetic receivers for interstellarcommunications; they were built by aliens; they were built by the Jews while incaptivity in Egypt; the Great Pyramid was designed to contain detailedinformation of world history and future in every inch of its plan; it was aBible in stone.So when I burst on the scene in 1994 with my first book, The Orion Mystery,showing that the pattern of the three Giza pyramids and their position relativeto the Nile mirrored the pattern of the three stars of Orion’s Belt and theirposition relative to the Milky Way, the subject was so much soiled and degradedthat any new theory that mentioned the “stars” or “astronomy” was immediatelymet with a barrage of academic indifference (at best), or vociferous opposition.The reaction was even more violent because my theory had received the (albeitcautious) backing of one of the world’s most eminent and most respectedEgyptologists, Sir I. E. S. Edwards, who had gallantly and boldly stuck his neckout on my behalf by appearing on the 1994 BBC2 documentary The GreatPyramid—Gateway to the Stars, in support of some of my ideas.This brought him the wrath of his peers, but it nonetheless twisted their armsand forced some to grudgingly review my theory. However, in the years thatfollowed, and especially after Edwards’ death in 1996, I was derided andpilloried by a cabal of Egyptologists and other “experts” seemingly determinedto “debunk” the Orion Correlation Theory, as my hypothesis was now being called.All this academic onslaught was most daunting and distressing, but I firmly heldmy ground, for I knew that I had not only generated massive interest and supportin the general public and the international media but that the theory I hadproposed neatly dovetailed into the context of Egypt’s Pyramid Age and providedthe “missing link” to an otherwise baffling mystery. Even the most entrenchedskeptic could not easily dismiss the Orion-Giza correlation as “coincidence.”Fourteen long years have now passed since the publication of The Orion Mystery.Meanwhile, the book has been published in more than twenty languages and therehave been dozens of television documentaries fully or partially-based on theOrion Correlation Theory (viz. Britain’s BBC2 and Channel 4; America’s ABC, NBC,and FOX; Europe and America’s Discovery Channel and History Channel; Italy’s RAI3; Germany’s ZDF and ARD; France’s ARTE and TF3; South Africa’s SABC and M-netTV; Holland’s AVRO TV; Australia’s Channel 7; Egypt’s NILE-TV and many moreother channels in the Far East and Middle East).Two more documentaries were aired with National Geographic television, bothentitled Unsolved Mysteries of the Pyramids (where my theories were criticallyreviewed), and another, Egypt Decoded, made for Italy’s RAI 2 and Holland’s AVROfully based on The Egypt Code. Slowly but surely, the Orion Correlation Theoryhas crept like a thief in the night into mainstream Egyptology and the newdiscipline of archeoastronomy. And even though it is given much lip andcriticism, it is very obvious that it has touched the proverbial nerve ofacademia.To be fair, not all academics were prone to dismiss The Orion Mystery. Some veryeminent Egyptologists, such as Dr. Jaromir Malek of the Griffith Institute andthe American Egyptologist Dr. Ed Meltzer kept an open mind just as the late SirI. E. S. Edwards had. More refreshingly, the theory received cautious supportfrom the astronomical community, particularly from Professor Archie Roy ofGlasgow University, Professor Mary Brück of Edinburgh University, ProfessorGiulio Magli of Politecnico di Milano, Professor Percy Seymour of PlymouthUniversity, and Professor Chandra Wikramasinghe of Cardiff University. And eventhough these high-ranking astronomers maintained a healthy skepticism, theynonetheless found the theory intriguing and deserving of careful considerationand further research.Also in the course of the years, a crack began to appear in the Egyptologicalacademic armor when Dr. Jaromir Malek (who had reviewed my theory in 1994 in theOxford journal Discussions in Egyptology) declared himself favorable to thepossibility that the apparent illogical scattering of pyramids in the Memphitenecropolis (a 24.8 mile [40 kilometer] long desert strip west of the Nile nearCairo) may, after all, have had more to do with “religious, astronomical, orsimilar” considerations than with purely practical considerations such as thetopography and geology of the land. Similar views began to be heard inEgyptology, especially from the American Egyptologist Mark Lehner, the CzechEgyptologist Miroslav Verner, and the British Egyptologist David Jeffreys.It was, however, the archaeoastronomer Anthony Aveni, a professor of astronomyand anthropology at Colgate University, who, in my view, would come the closestin providing an overall picture of what may have been in the minds of theancient architects who designed and planned such mysterious monuments (not onlyin Egypt but in other parts of the ancient world). He wrote that, “In order tounderstand what ancient people thought about the world around them, we mustbegin by witnessing phenomena through their eyes. A knowledge of each particularculture is necessary, but learning what the sky contains and how each entitymoves is also indispensable . . . strange but true: Whole cities, kingdoms, andempires were founded based on observations and interpretations of natural eventsthat pass undetected under our noses and above our heads.”Dr. Aveni was referring to the Maya and Inca civilizations when he made theabove statement—but he may as well have been talking about Egypt’s Old Kingdom,for I am now even more convinced that such a statement holds truer for thesacred cities, pyramids, and temples built by the ancient Egyptians along the621.4 miles (1,000 kilometers) of the Nile Valley during their three thousandyears of civilization. And this, in a nutshell, is what I set out to prove inThe Egypt Code.By the year 2000, I was ready to put the findings of my investigation into bookform. To this end I presented a synopsis to my editor at Random House in London,who promptly commissioned the project. By early 2004, I had a first draft ready.The final draft, however, was completed in Egypt. In February 2005, I rented afully furnished apartment with a direct view over the Giza pyramids. Being heregave me the unique opportunity to refine the book with a hands-on approach tothe pyramids in Lower Egypt and the great temples of Upper Egypt, and to verifyand test the various ideas of my thesis. Imbued with the enchantment and magicof these ancient sites I have, I believe, succeeded, in more ways than one, inbringing the sky-ground correlation theory I started two decades ago to itsnatural conclusion.In The Egypt Code, I have made use of primary sources whenever available, andrelied only on scholarly research published in peer-reviewed journals or intextbooks by renowned Egyptologists and other scholars. My readers should expectno less from me. Culling my data from all of these sources, I have come to thisconclusion: The ancient Egyptian theocracy was regulated by a cosmic ordercalled Ma’at, which was none other than the order of the sky: the observable,precise, and predictable cycles of the sun, the moon, and the stars. I have alsoconcluded that this Cosmic Order was fervently believed to influence thematerial world below, especially the all-important annual flooding of the Nile,for nothing more fascinated, awed, and frightened the ancient Egyptians than theNile’s flood, which began in late June and ended in late September. This was theannual miracle that rejuvenated the crops and all other life in Egypt, orbrought famine and pestilence if the waters failed to rise.This double-edged sword that hung perpetually over Egypt compelled the Niledwellers to seek magical means to ensure a good flood. Early in theirdevelopment they came to observe that the stars of Orion and Sirius woulddisappear underneath the western horizon after sunset in late March and remainfor a protracted period (about three months) in the “underworld” beforereemerging on the eastern horizon at dawn in late June just when the waters ofthe Nile began to rise. During this crucial period of the stars’ sojourn in the“underworld,” the astronomer-priests also noted that the sun traveled from apoint on the ecliptic just below the bright cluster of the Pleiades (marking thevernal point) to a spot farther along the ecliptic just below the chest of thecelestial lion, Leo (marking the summer solstice), that bracketed theconstellation of Orion and Sirius.The idea began to enter their minds that when the Sun God journeyed through thatspecial part of the sky—the Duat, as it was called—he performed a magicalritual, a sort of “stations of the cross,” that would bring about the “rebirth”of the stars as well as the “rebirth” of the Nile when, in late June, the starSirius would reappear at dawn on the eastern horizon. This event happened toalso fall on the day of the summer solstice, when the sun would reach itsmaximal northerly declination, and was for good reason taken as New Year’s Dayand called (among other things) the “Birth of Ra,” the Sun God.A mythology and sky-religion developed around this cosmic and Nilotic theme and,more intriguingly, an ambitious plan was gradually hatched around 2800 BCE to“bring down,” in the literal sense, the Cosmic Order so that the pharaoh, theson of Ra on Earth, could undertake the same magical journey in an earthly Duatand thus secure for Egypt a “good” flood (recall the Hermetic dictum: As above,so below). To this end, a massive pan-generational project was put into actionthat would involve building clusters of “star”-pyramids at predetermined sitesto represent Orion and the Pleiades, as well as the building of great“sun”-temples set on both sides of the Nile to define the part of the eclipticalong which the Sun God traveled through the Duat from vernal equinox to summersolstice, set on both sides of the Milky Way.My new theory doesn’t stop there—I was also able to determine that the slowcyclical changes witnessed in the sky landscape caused by precession and by thepeculiarities of the Egyptian civil calendar over the three thousand years ofthe pharaonic civilization are reflected in the changes witnessed on the groundall along the 621.4 miles (1,000 kilometers) of the Nile Valley in the evolutionof temples throughout the same three thousand years. In other words, The EgyptCode proposes, no less, to prove that there exists a sort of “cosmic Egypt”ghosted in the geography of the Nile Valley stretching from north to south thatwas once literally regulated and administered by astronomer-priests headed by asun-king; that this cosmic Egypt lasted for over three millennia, and that itcan still be discerned in the layout of the pyramids and temples that remaintoday.My thesis is entirely verifiable, testable, and ultimately falsifiable if needbe. Indeed, I happily welcome Egyptologists and other scholars and researchersin the field of Egyptian archaeology and history to step up to the debate."},{"pageContent":"F O U RALTERNATIVE HISTORY AND ESOTERIC PHILOSOPHYTWO PORTALS INTO THE SAME WORLD?MARK BOOTHSomething that often surprises me about the opponents of alternative history ishow readily they stoop to intellectual dishonesty.

If the scientifically correct were sure of their ground, perhapsthey wouldn’t feel the need to behave so shiftily?Yet they do, and more’s the pity on several deep and important levels, asalternative history often touches on what the existentialist theologian PaulTillich called “the ultimate questions”—where we come from, who we are, and whatthe meaning of life might be. Of course, ideally, these questions should inspirea wholehearted desire to discover the truth. We should be passionatelyinterested, yet scrupulously disinterested, setting aside all partisanaffiliations, even the desire to be right, because the answers we give to thoseultimate questions determines the very way we choose to live our lives.Exactly how does alternative history bear on the ultimate questions? I thinkthat this is best explained using an example that is central to alternativehistory. If the Sphinx dates back deep into what’s conventionally called theStone Age—in other words if it is many thousands of years older thanconventional, academic history allows—then it follows that we are not who wethought we were. Our history has different patterns than the accepted ones.This question of the age of the Sphinx is also an example of a curious featureof the human condition as a whole, a feature that is quite remarkable, but oftenoverlooked: When it comes to issues like these, we find ourselves dealing withminute fragments of evidence that admit of many different interpretations,sometimes even contradictory ones.It seems to me that when it comes to the great questions of history, and to thegreat questions of life and death that are tied up with them, the evidence isoften not so overwhelming that it imposes an answer on us. We often have greatlatitude when we choose what to believe.Perhaps we can then choose what we want to believe?Important, then, to be aware of which part of ourselves is doing the choosing,that we do not choose unconsciously, but instead bring our full intellect tobear. Is it the part that really wants to know the truth that is doing thechoosing? Or is it the partisan, egotistical side that wants to be right or tobe on the winning side?The fact that we are in a position to consider the ultimate questions in arelaxed and tolerant way, and without trying to tear each other’s throats out,the fact that a wonderful forum like Graham Hancock’s website exists, is atleast in part due to the work of secret societies—in particular, the secretsocieties that lay behind the Royal Society, and therefore the great scientificand industrial revolutions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Thesesecret societies created protected spaces (sometimes called lodges) wherefreethinking, disinterested intellectual enquiry could take place.In these spaces, people like Isaac Newton, Robert Boyle, Robert Hooke, and BruceHarvey were not only able to discover and define gravity, formulate the law ofthermodynamics that paved the way for the internal combustion engine, invent themicroscope, and uncover the workings of the circulatory system, they were alsoable to pursue their interest in alchemy and other arcane subjects. When anoutsider questioned Newton about his interest in astrology, he is reported tohave replied, “Sir, I have studied it, you have not.” Newton also believed thatwe live in a world dense with secret codes—in the laws of nature, in books likethe Bible, and in ancient monuments like the ones on the Giza Plateau. They wereput there, he believed, to help draw our intelligence out of us.The initiates of the secret societies had realized that you get two verydifferent sets of results if you look at the world as objectively as possiblyand then, on other occasions, as subjectively as possible. This realizationbrought great material benefits to the world, but it also opened up many strangerealms of thought. . . .It was brooding on these sorts of things, especially the dates of the monumentson the Giza Plateau, that led me to think that I might have a contribution tomake as a writer. In my day job, I was editing and publishing (at differenttimes) not only Graham and Robert, but also Robert Lomas and Christopher Knight,Robert Temple, David Rohl, and Michael Baigent. In my spare time, I had alsodeveloped an interest in esoteric philosophy, in Theosophy (with a big as wellas a small “t”), in the Rosicrucians, and in their modern representatives, theAnthroposophists. I used to delight in finding obscure and weird old books aboutthe esoteric and mystical in secondhand bookshops—for example, the works of magilike Paracelsus and Jacob Böhme.It struck me that, although as far as I knew none of these alternativehistorians were—at that stage, at any rate—much interested in esotericphilosophy, many of their discoveries were confirming its tenets, regarding, forexample, the claims that the Sphinx and the Great Pyramid are much older thanconventional history allows, or related claims regarding the historical realityof Atlantis and the Flood.If new evidence was being unearthed that suggested that extremely importanttraditions like these have some basis in historical reality, the questionnaturally arises: what other traditional esoteric information about historymight also be true? So I planned to try to weave together, into one narrative,historical lore from different esoteric traditions from around the world. Toachieve one narrative thread, I decided to focus on what they had incommon—discarding what are sometimes called “cultural accidentals”—and also tofocus, where possible, on traditions that chime in with the latest discoveriesof alternative history.I very quickly realized that if this history was to be in one volume, ratherthan spreading across many, many volumes, it could not incorporate debate as towhether its claims—the arguments for and against the Sphinx being some twelvethousand years old, for example—are true. This would have to be a “take it orleave it” history. If readers wanted to follow up on the pros and cons of thesedebates, they’d have to turn to the works referenced at the back. (In the caseof the Sphinx, these would be books by Graham and Robert, John Anthony West,Robert Temple, and Schwaller de Lubicz.)After a while, I began to formulate a theory on what these esoteric traditionshad in common: they all describe the ways that the supernatural works in theworld. Gods, angels, and spirits may have different names in different placesand at different times, but, according to secret teachings everywhere, thepatterns they help make, and the shapes they give to our lives are the same.Therefore, my resulting book, The Secret History of the World, describespatterns that wouldn’t be there if materialistic science accounted foreverything.These patterns in history are perhaps deeper than the laws of economics, theeffects of climate change, and the conventional, materialistic view of politicsthat interests modern, academic historians. In other words, I show historyoperating according to what I call (after the poet Rainer Maria Rilke) theDeeper Laws. Then, at the end of the book I invite readers to look at their ownlives to see if they can’t find these same Deeper Laws operating there.In the book, I tried to weave together different mystical traditions about ourbeginnings and endings and great turning points in between into one epicimaginative vision. My aim was to see if this imaginative vision formed acoherent, cogent whole that might be set against the scientific materialist one.I couldn’t think of anyone who had tried to do this since Milton, and he haddone it in very different circumstances, when scientific materialism wasbeginning to roll back the idealism that had been the universal philosophy up tothat point. Madly, I asked myself if it were possible to create an imaginativevision that would be a sort of mirror image to Milton’s—written at a time whenscientific materialism seems to many to be beginning to fray and look a bit thinat the edges.The world is a much more mysterious place than we have been brought up tobelieve. There are other ways of knowing than the one we have been taught. Thepriests and artists of the Egyptian and Hindu temples knew of and understood thefunction of the pineal gland thousands of years before it was “discovered” byGerman and English anatomists (more or less simultaneously) in 1866.*3[../Text/ch21.html#anchor_1978_0] Robert Temple has shown that the Egyptianpriests knew that Sirius is a three-star system, something only confirmed byFrench astronomers using radio telescopes in the second half of the twentiethcentury.According to Rudolf Steiner—the founder of Anthroposophy—knowledge of theevolution of the species from marine life to amphibian to land animal toanatomically modern human was encoded thousands of years ago in the imagery ofthe constellations. Jonathan Swift was deeply immersed in esoteric philosophy.In Gulliver’s Travels, he predicted the existence and orbital periods of themoons of Mars. A hundred years later, when astronomers first observed thesemoons using the latest telescopes, they named them Phobos and Deimos—fear andterror—so awestruck were they by Swift’s evident supernatural powers.How did these guys know? Where did their “powers” come from? Is there somethinggoing on we don’t fully understand?Again, the intellectual establishment would like us to see a very cleardistinction between modern scientific endeavor and the occult, seen as primitiveand superstitious—but as I demonstrate, the line is not always clear.We’ve already touched on Newton, Boyle, Hooke, and Harvey. Newton’s rival indevising the calculus, Gottfried Leibniz, made his advances while studying theKabbalah. Paracelsus, the great Swiss magus, a great practical alchemistsometimes credited with inventing the principles that lie behind homeopathy, hasalso been called the father of modern experimental medicine. Emanuel Swedenborg,the most famous psychic and esoteric teacher of his day, also discovered thecerebral cortex and engineered the largest dry dock in the world. Perhapssignificantly, Charles Darwin formulated his theory of evolution shortly afterhis friend Friedrich Max Müller had made the first translations into a Europeanlanguage. Sigmund Freud was very interested in the Kabbalah as a boy, and hismodel of the mind—super ego, ego, and id—can be seen as a materialistic versionof the Kabbalistic one.Carl Jung based his account of what he called the Seven Great Archetypes of theCollective Unconscious on the spirits of the planets as they have always beenunderstood in esoteric lore. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the phonograph (andso, in a sense, the godfather of all recorded sound) and Alexander Graham Bell,the inventor of the telephone, made their discoveries while researching thespirit worlds. Edison tried to make a radio that would tune into the spiritworlds. Even television was invented as a result of scientists trying to capturepsychic influences on gases fluctuating in front of a cathode ray tube.Scientists from Newton to Tesla to Einstein have also talked about their greatdiscoveries coming to them suddenly in a dream or in a vision. Einstein evencompared the process to “the three degrees of initiation” of the ancients. I wasfascinated to hear from Graham Hancock that Francis Crick cracked the code ofthe double helix and launched modern genetic medicine while he was on an LSDtrip.The reality is that we all perceive things in altered states of consciousness—indreams, visions, prayerful states, meditations, perhaps under the influence ofdrugs, and when we’re struck by hunches and premonitions. The key question is:Are any of the things we perceive in these altered states real, or are they alldelusions? In other words: Do altered states bring other ways of knowing?Only a fool would deny that science has brought untold benefits to the world.(And I don’t mean “fool” in an interesting esoteric way, I mean just plainstupid.) Science has made our lives safer, easier, more comfortable, longer, andgiven us more spare time for enjoying ourselves, for art and speculation.However, these benefits have come at a cost.We have been enabled to make scientific leaps forward because we have been sofocused on the material world. We have constructed a practical, commonsensicalform of consciousness for ourselves that is great for tying our shoelaces in themorning, navigating our way around our mechanical world in our cars and planes,and fending for ourselves and our families.Yet other, more subjective forms of consciousness, other ways of knowing, havebeen squeezed out, devalued, and discarded. Esoteric philosophy is thesystematic cultivation of these other ways of knowing. It is also the richesttradition of thinking about “the ultimate questions.” The more I researched myhistory, the more I discovered just how many of the great men and women ofhistory were steeped in it. I began to wonder if it might even be the case thatevery intelligent person checks it out at some time or other.In the late nineteenth century, writing of the totality of reality as consistingof “the playground of numberless Universes incessantly manifesting anddisappearing,” Madame Blavatsky prophesied some of the leaps forward thatscience would make in the twentieth century. Although many leading scientists inthe twenty-first century postulate possible universes and multiple dimensions, Isuspect most of us live—in terms of our everyday, unconsidered worldview—in asolid, commonsense sort of universe with just one dimension. There, causality isstill a matter of atom knocking against atom like billiard balls—with entirelypredictable results.This leads, I believe, to two closely related and very common logical fallacies.These fallacies are typical of scientific correctness. One is to believe that ifan event can be shown to have one cause, no other causes of it are possible. Soan example relevant to my work would be to believe that because thunder andlightning can now be explained in terms of clashing blocks of air andelectricity, this proves that they cannot be the result of the anger of a god.Another example that relates to a common present-day belief would be that if youcould capture a pigeon shedding a feather on CCTV just before you walked intoview, then you would know that the pigeon is the cause of your sighting of thefeather, not that an angel is trying to send you a message.The reality we are more likely to recognize if we don’t have an antispiritual axto grind is that we commonly accept that simple events have infinite networks ofcauses behind them, and so that, in these examples, there is nothing contrary tologic about supposing that both the mechanical and spiritual explanations may betrue at the same time.One might call this fallacy—with a little ironic nod to the law of excludedmiddle—the “law of excluded cause.”Closely related to this fallacy is another one to do with the interpretation oftexts: if it can be shown that, for example, biblical or mythological storiessuch as the conquest of the Promised Land, the voyage of Jason and theArgonauts, or the siege of Troy are descriptions of astronomical events oralchemical processes, they cannot be true descriptions of historical events.That simply does not follow. To borrow Alvin Plantinga’s tools of analysis,there are many possible universes in which both these interpretations aretrue.*4 [../Text/ch21.html#anchor_1980_0] Indeed, in the esoteric universe of mybook, all true descriptions of events on this planet are also true descriptionsof astronomical events.One of the aims of my book was to give consciousness a slight nudge away fromthe billiard ball view to something more multidimensional, more in tune with thereality of interpenetrating realms.Interpenetrating realms are also reflected in the form of some esotericliterature. I’m sure that anyone reading this will be familiar with Kabbalisticnumber mysticism and the idea that there are other texts encoded within theHebrew scriptures. A Cambridge-based statistician came to me recently with sometexts he had derived using “skip codes,” which he had then translated fromHebrew into English. These texts were a bit fragmentary, as if the skip codeweren’t 100 percent accurate, but in subject matter and form they were somewhatlike the Psalms.It seems to me entirely possible that this kind of research will eventuallyyield entire other books encoded within the books of the Hebrew scriptures—andthe question that naturally arises is will these other books have further booksencoded in them, and so on to infinitude?To write books with other books encoded within them would seem to requiresupernatural intelligence. Yet great initiates, including Rabelais and hiscontemporary at Montpellier University, Nostradamus, as well as Shakespeare, aresometimes said to have written in what is called the Green Language—a languagethat reflects different orders of reality in its different layers of meaning.I leave you with one last possibility—could we all be thinking, speaking, andwriting the Green Language all the time? Could the only difference between usand the great initiates be that we do it unconsciously?A senior publisher I know—a rather down-to-earth and worldly fellow, I don’tthink he’d mind me saying—started to read The Secret History of the World,saying that he wasn’t sure if he could take it seriously; wasn’t even sure hewas meant to take it seriously. In fact, he may have used the phrase “apparentlybarmy!” However, by the end he said that he had started to see life from aslightly different angle, to notice connections. A senior publicist of a rathermore spiritual inclination, who began to read it at the same time, started toexperience some mild, supernatural phenomena. The last I heard, the two of themwere planning a trip together to the British Museum to stand in front of theLohan—a statue alluded to in my book, which seems to have mysterious properties.I can’t claim my book offers initiation. As I explain, I am not an initiatemyself—but feedback like this reminds me how much help I have had writing thisbook, and that much of the imagery that flows through the narrative was devised(by minds far more intelligent than mine) to work at a below-conscious level.The Dawkins tendency has pretty much had its own way recently. I believe thatnothing will turn the tide of materialism except real, lived spiritualexperience. When you’ve had that, you don’t believe—as Jung said, you know. Andthat, as I try to show in my writing, is what the esoteric teaching of thesecret societies has always offered."},{"pageContent":"F I V EAN OPEN LETTER TO THE EDITORS OF ARCHAEOLOGYTAKING TRADITIONALISTS TO TASKJOHN ANTHONY WESTRe: Atlantis and BeyondThe Lure of Bogus Archaeology(Or: “The Anupadeshi Strike Back”)A Special Section in Archaeology, May/June 2003Gentlemen (and scholars),An acknowledgment:I am delighted to learn that our 1993 NBC special Mystery of the Sphinx (basedupon geological investigations carried out by me and my geologist colleague Dr.Robert M. Schoch of Boston University) has been awarded top honors in your“Worst of Television Archaeology” list. The show “Argues that the Sphinx isthousands of years older than currently believed and includes comparisons of theSphinx with the Face on Mars (since shown to be wholly natural . . .).”Short of having my books singled out and condemned by an official George W. Bushpresidential decree, I could not feel more flattered. I regret only that youhave no physical equivalent of an Oscar or Tony to go with it. It sure wouldlook good on my old oak filing cabinet, right next to the Emmy I won for “BestResearch” for Mystery of the Sphinx, which, by the way, was also one of fournominated for “Best Documentary of 1993.” Anyway, I think that extraordinarydisparity in public opinion a healthy sign, don’t you—proof that democracy isstill with us, alive and well, despite appearances to the contrary? Would you bekind enough to send me a parchment diploma, a little printed certificate . . .something, anything to hang on the wall to prove that our show won?The Special Section“Why do people so desperately want to believe in Atlantis-style tales?” moansArchaeology editor Peter Young, unable to comprehend why people are turned awayfrom the “real” archaeology featured in his magazine. Bogus archaeology expertGarrett Fagan, assistant professor of classics and author of the epic,bestselling, modern day scholarly classic Bathing in Public in the Roman Worldexplains,There is little doubt that presenting science (and archaeology) on television isa difficult business. The slow pace of change in scientific thinking, thehabitual lack of consensus among academics about details, and the often complexnature of the arguments involved place pressures on producers. . . . Theunspectacular and painstaking nature of the discipline does not make forparticularly spectacular television. For how long will viewers sit throughscenes of dirt-sifting through knee-high ruins?That may sound plausible, but it is claptrap. Interest in archaeology is no moredependent upon sifting through dirt than interest in baseball is dependent uponspring training or bat manufacture. Like baseball fans, archaeology fans revelin the game—which in this case is not dirt-sifting, but uncovering andinterpreting the past. It is the significance and the relevance of thosediscoveries that generate interest. The key word here is “significance.”The audience will sit through plenty of “dirt-sifting” if the stakes are highand valid. Your prizewinning selection for “Worst Television Archaeology” hadits obligatory patina of network glitz, but most of that show was devoted to acomplex scientific geological argument. The audience was riveted, and still is.It is not that “people want so desperately to believe in Atlantis-style tales,”it is that they are smart enough to recognize the comic triviality of your pettydiscipline. Again, Fagan inadvertently supplies the clue (just about everythingFagan supplies is inadvertent). Those heated arguments over “detail” (the BigPicture is agreed upon by the “experts”; only “details” remain) appeal to nobodybut yourselves. The archaeologically uninitiated cannot be made to warm tofurious debates over how many asps killed Cleopatra (Serpent in the Sky, p.9)—especially when profound mysteries, self-evident to all acquainted with theproblems involved, go unexplored, their very existence left doggedly unsifted byarchaeological consensus.We do not know how the pyramids were built, we do not know why they were built(there is no evidence, none, that the pyramids of Giza and Dahshur ever servedas tombs, though other pyramids did. They may have been tombs, but there is noevidence that they were—got it? Science is supposed to be based upon evidence,not inference). We do not know how the two-hundred-ton blocks of the Sphinx andValley temples and the paving blocks surrounding the Pyramid of Khafre weremoved and put into place, and so on. People are not as stupid or gullible as youthink they are. They don’t buy your version of the Big Picture. It’s as simpleas that. Unfortunately, they also aren’t very discriminating. They tend not todistinguish between, say, an Erich von Däniken and an R. A. Schwaller deLubicz—but then, neither do you.To understand your unsolvable PR and image problems and the public’s stubbornrefusal to accept your word as Gospel, all you have to do is reflect upon whatyou wrote in your own special section—and, more important, what you didn’twrite. Mystery of the Sphinx wins your “First Worst Prize,” and yet, in allthose pages devoted to the wholesale denigration (and often misrepresentation)of the work of Graham Hancock, Robert Bauval, and everyone else who dareschallenge the Sacred Archaeological Status Quo, there is no response to thegeology—the water-weathering to the Great Sphinx—precisely that which qualifiesit for Worst Place honors. Not a word. How odd! But there is a good reason forit.Because you have no response, that’s why. And it is that (so far) irrefutablegeology that justifies and legitimizes the entire search for alternatives—fromcarefully developed and sound mathematical and astronomical theories down to vonDäniken and the wilder shores of alien intervention. Until you find a way todisprove the geology, the search itself is neither “bogus” nor “pseudo,” thoughsome of the material cited as evidence may well fit those categories. . . .Curious note: If an archaeologist is disproved on some significant detail (saythat, given enough is through dirt, it is established that Cleopatra committedsuicide using just one asp after all), multiple asp proponents will be called“mistaken” and “wrong,” but if those outside the archaeological Vatican make ano more egregious mistake, they are practicing bogus or pseudo science.To bring Archaeology readers up to date on the geology—since developments inthis ongoing investigation somehow do not find their way into your pages—here isa brief update. Our geological evidence was presented first at the annualmeeting of the Geological Society of America (GSA) in 1991; further compellingevidence was presented at the GSA meeting in 2000, both times with theoverwhelming support of attending geologists—and shrieks of outrage fromarchaeologists and Egyptologists.Over the intervening years a handful of opposing geologists, most with a stakein academic archaeology or Egyptology, have offered mutually exclusivealternative theories to account for that weathering ranging from demonstrablyjust plain wrong (K. Lal Gauri) to certifiably inept and inane (James “Wet Sand”Harrell’s theory). All have been easily, systematically, and conclusivelydismantled and rebutted point by point. Meanwhile, two English geologists, ColinReader and David Coxill, independent of each other and of ourselves, havestudied the matter on site and support the theory (precipitation-inducedweathering) unconditionally, categorically necessitating rethinking the datingof the Sphinx, and along with it pretty much everything archaeologists accept asdogma regarding very ancient history.The actual dating remains a matter of debate, so the extent of that rethinkingprocess cannot be determined at this point with certainty—but that it must beradical is apparent to all but yourselves. Which is one reason why a quarter ofa billion people (rough estimate) have seen Mystery of the Sphinx and been wonover by it. It is often bought by teachers (sometimes with their own money) toshow to students from grade school up through college level; it has considerablesupport among academics and scientists across a spectrum of disciplines not indanger of caving in from the implications of a vastly older Sphinx. (Threatenedby evidence as revolutionary as this in their own fields, they’d probably reactas you do, but that is not the issue here.)It is even taken seriously by a handful of credentialed Egyptologists andarchaeologists, who mostly keep quiet about it, not wanting to subjectthemselves to the predictable academic auto-da-fé they know will be their lot iftheir interest is revealed. It is, however, discussed briefly (but takenseriously) by Egyptologist Edmund Meltzer in his essay on the history ofEgyptology in (that encyclopedia of New Age pseudoscholarship) The OxfordEncyclopedia of Ancient Egypt, edited by Donald Redford. Closet New Age flakesshow up in the strangest places, don’t they?While our geological evidence does not in itself prove the existence of aphysical Atlantis (we never said it did), it goes a long way toward proving theexistence of an “Atlantis,” a highly developed civilization capable of movingaround two-hundred-ton blocks of stone at a time when civilization is notsupposed to have existed at all. In other words, it scuttles the historicalcontext of your entire discipline. Yet there’s not one word about the geology inyour pages of carefully orchestrated debunkery masquerading as scholarship.Strange omission! Yet hardly unique. Your fourth-place “Best of TelevisionArchaeology” entry, “‘Atlantis Reborn Again’ (Systematic Dismantling of GrahamHancock’s Proposition About His ‘Lost Civilization’)” resorts to the samechicanery. In that television equivalent of Archaeology’s hatchet job, there isalso no mention of the geology of the Sphinx. A long filmed interview withSchoch on the subject was carefully edited down to a brief appearance in whichhe gives his negative opinion on the underwater Yonaguni formations. (Thisstriking site, with its remarkable geometric angular ledges and walls isbelieved, by Hancock and others, to be man-made, or at least man-doctored. Ifso, it would be the “smoking gun” testifying to the “lost civilization” we arelooking for. Schoch and I are 99 percent convinced that it is wholly natural—butit is always wise to leave that 1 percent open. As they say in the ads for theNew York State Lottery, “Hey! You never know.”) So Schoch’s opinion was goodenough to refute Yonaguni, but not good enough to support the water-weatheringto the Sphinx. There’s no mention of that.In a court of law, that’s called “withholding evidence,” and it’s a crime. Ifacademic malpractice were a crime (not a bad idea!), a lot of archaeologistswouldn’t be walking around on the loose. Chris Hale, the producer of “AtlantisReborn Again,” largely escaped the consequences of withholding evidence. Asunprincipled as you, but less maladroit, he had the wit not to hand out a “FirstWorst Prize.” And it is difficult to prove “intent” when the evidence is totallyexcluded—but you, in your debunking zeal, could not resist calling attention tothe geology by bestowing the prize and then conveniently failing to discuss whatqualifies it for the honor.Presumably you thought no one would notice? Now they will. Thanks to theInternet hundreds of thousands, maybe millions will notice.The Reason WhyBut while this reveals the modus operandi of your scholarship, it does notreally account for the attraction to alternative views that motivates thespecial section. That attraction is actually justified by Fagan, even as hediscounts it. “Pseudo-archaeology fans,” he sneers, “get attracted to all sortsof odd notions. Their ancient civilizations are better than ours, more peaceful,more spiritually attuned.”Now this is a curious, wholly subjective statement coming from a self-proclaimedscientist supposedly devoted to objective truth, and it merits dissection (or,more accurately, trisection). “Better” is not an “odd notion.” It is a judgmentcall. Me? I would prefer to live in a world without hydrogen bombs and trafficjams, a world where you can drink the water. On the other hand, even I wouldrather go to a twenty-first century dentist than a Twenty-First Dynasty dentist.On balance, I’d say ancient was “better,” but it depends entirely upon how one’svalues are weighted. Fagan has every right to disagree—which, in turn, I mightcall an “odd notion.”“More peaceful?” Well, since the world has never been less peaceful than it isat present, this does not seem such an “odd notion” either, especially if you goback far enough. Old Kingdom Egypt was most assuredly more peaceful thananything around today. That is demonstrable.“More spiritually attuned?” Here, inadvertently as always, Fagan has stumbledupon the core of the matter. That ancient civilizations were more spirituallyinclined and directed (I’ll get to “attuned”) is undeniable. A civilization maybe judged infallibly by what it does with its collective creative energy. (Youdo not have to be a Christian or even religious to recognize the truth of “Yeshall know them by their fruits”—Matthew 7:16.)We put the bulk of our creative energies into shopping malls, weapons of massdestruction, Hollywood and television trash, bobble-head dolls, and Disneyland,with a dollop left over for clever but emotionally bereft science andtechnology—most of it destructive and/or frivolous, a small percentage of itundeniably beneficial. Egypt (and all other ancient peoples, to a greater orlesser extent) put their creative energies into temples, tombs, and pyramids,all designed to facilitate the quest for immortality. This is a “fact” thatshould be apparent even to archaeologists—but does it qualify for “spiritualattunement?” I’d say yes. All you have to do is go to Egypt and experience itfor yourself. It is self-evident . . . to all but the emotionally defective andspiritually dyslexic. Still, it’s a judgment call. It has nothing to do with“science”; not our science, at any rate. Yet that it should qualify as an “oddnotion” in the Fagan lexicon is revealing.To our Church of Progress (materialist, rationalist, Darwinian), “spiritual” isa synonym for “superstitious,” and “spiritually attuned” is thereforemeaningless. There can be no attunement if there is no spirit. So why use thatparticular word? Why not grant the ancients their demonstrable ancientpreoccupation with superstition, and leave the pseudo-archaeologists to theirs?After all, we are not threatening your biological survival—the only “value”permissible in your one-dimensional Darwinian cosmos (though that, too, ispurely subjective; I won’t go into that here). Yet it is deemed dangerous.Pseudo-archaeology must be contested, stamped out. Why?My old Japanese sensei put a finger on it. He used to counsel, in his broken butpungent English, “You want happy in klazy world? No talk moonbeam to blind man;no talk music to deaf man; and never, not ever you talk sex to eunuch. Him justget angry, sometime violent.”This accounts for all that contumely and vituperation, the misrepresentation anddeliberate neglect of real evidence; the rant, cant, and intolerant yap of theDefenders of the Archaeological Faith on the “Hall of Ma’at” website so heartilyendorsed by Karen M. Romey in her contribution to the special section(characterized by “Ma’at” contributor Paul Heinrich as response “in a polite andunderstandable fashion”).Like academic dogs in the manger, you would deny others access to that which youare incapable of digesting yourselves. Spiritual attunement cannot beacknowledged. The ancients could not possibly have had knowledge or facultiesyou do not have. Everything must be kept locked up nice and safe in your littleDarwinian box just in case someone pries open the lid and finds the Emperor’snew clothes inside.It’s your loss—but, if you’re actually interested in understanding why vastnumbers of people refuse to accept your establishment expertise, this is why.Your special section will change nothing. It is an exercise in flawlesslysustained futility.You also don’t have your facts straight. A discipline exulting in minute detail(compare to Fagan) should be scrupulous in such matters. The Mars material youderide in Mystery of the Sphinx was never shown on TV. It was not part of theoriginal NBC special, but was instead an addition to the expanded home videoversion. And I make it absolutely clear in that version that I am not endorsingeither the Face or (especially) its putative relation to Egypt, but rather,consider the evidence supporting the notion provocative enough to meritinclusion. The Face, by the way, has NOT been “shown to be completely natural”;though NASA, the space equivalent of orthodox archaeologists, declares it so.There are a number of astronomers, geologists, physicists, and imaging experts,no less qualified than those at NASA, who do not accept that declaration. Sincethis is not our field, we happily leave that particular question open.JOHN ANTHONY WEST"},{"pageContent":"S I XDARK MISSIONTHE SECRET HISTORY OF NASARICHARD C. HOAGLANDMy name is Richard C. Hoagland. I was a National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration (NASA) consultant to the Goddard Spaceflight Center in thepost-Apollo era, and science advisor to Walter Cronkite and CBS News SpecialEvents, advising CBS on the science of the NASA missions to the moon and Marsduring the Apollo Program. I currently run the Enterprise Mission, anindependent NASA watchdog and research group, which is attempting to figure outhow much of what NASA has found in the solar system over the past fifty yearshas actually been silently filed out of sight as classified material, andtherefore remains totally unknown to the American people.My friend and colleague Mike Bara and I attempt the impossible in our book DarkMission: The Secret History of NASA. We describe, and then carefully document,exactly what’s been going on with NASA in terms of that classified data andinformation. It is not an easy task.The predisposition of most Americans—even after the Challenger and Columbiadisasters and a host of other “missing” spacecraft—is to place NASA somewhere onpar with Mother Teresa in terms of public confidence and credibility. This is,in major part, due to the average American’s (to say nothing of the media’s)inability to figure out a reason why NASA—ostensibly a purely scientificagency—would actually lie. NASA is, after all, holding high the beacon of ourlast true heroes, the astronauts.However, even a hint that NASA—or, more precisely, its leadership—has beencarrying out any kind of hidden agenda for over fifty years is met withdisbelief at best. The vast majority of NASA’s nearly 18,000 full-time employeesare, in our analysis, innocent of the wrongdoing of the few that we are going todescribe. The truth is that NASA was born in a lie, and has gone toextraordinary lengths to conceal the facts of its occult origins and itssensational discoveries on the moon and Mars.Few people are aware that NASA was formed as a national defense agency adjunctempowered to keep information classified and secret from the public at large.Even fewer people are aware of the hard evidence that secret brotherhoodsquietly dominate NASA, with policies far more aligned with ancient religious andoccult mystery schools than the facade of rational science the government agencyhas successfully promoted to the world for almost fifty years.Why was the Bush administration intent on returning to the moon as quickly aspossible? What are the reasons for the current “space race” with China, Russia,and even India?To even begin to fully appreciate what NASA has been quite consciously,deliberately, and methodically concealing from the American people and the worldfor all these years, you have to begin with NASA’s turbulent past—specifically,an account of its origins in the increasingly dangerous geopolitical environmentthat Americans were thrust into in the wake of World War II.The governmental institution known as NASA is a department of the executivebranch, ultimately answerable solely to the president of the United States, anagency created through the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958. Accordingto that act, NASA is, ostensibly, “a civilian agency exercising control overaeronautical and space activities sponsored by the United States.” [Italicsadded.]However, contrary to common public and media perception that NASA is an open,strictly civilian scientific institution is the legal fact that the space agencywas quietly founded as a direct adjunct to the Department of Defense, taskedwith specifically assisting the national security of the United States in themidst of a deepening Cold War with its major geopolitical adversary, the SovietUnion. It says so right in the original NASA Charter: “Sec. 305 . . . (i) The[National Aeronautics and Space] Administration shall be considered a defenseagency of the United States for the purpose of Chapter 17, Title 35 of theUnited States Code. . . .” [Italics added.]In another section of the act, this seldom-discussed defense responsibility—theultimate undercutting of NASA’s continuing public facade as a strictly civilian,scientific agency—is blatantly spelled out: “Sec. 205 . . . (d) No [NASA]information which has been classified for reasons of national security shall beincluded in any report made under this section [of the act]. . . .” [Italicsadded.]Clearly, from this and the other security provisions incorporated in the act,what the Congress, the press, and the American taxpayers get to see of NASA’sultimate activities—including untouched images and data regarding what’s reallyon the moon, on Mars or anywhere else across the solar system—is totallydependent on whether the president of the United States (and/or his legalsurrogates in the Department of Defense and the “intelligence community”) hasalready secretly classified that data. This is directly contrary to everythingwe’ve been led to believe regarding NASA for over fifty years now.After NASA was formed, almost before the ink was dry on the bill that brought itinto being (which, among many other detailed objectives, called for “theestablishment of long-range studies of the potential benefits to be gained from,the opportunities for, and the problems involved in the use of aeronautical andspace activities for peaceful and scientific purposes”), NASA commissioned aformal “futures study” into the projected effects on American society of itsmany planned activities (including covert ones).Carried out as a formal NASA contract to the Brookings Institution—a well-knownWashington, D.C.–based think tank—the 1959 study was officially titled “ProposedStudies on the Implications of Peaceful Space Activities for Human Affairs.” Theresults of this multidisciplinary investigation were officially submitted to theadministrator of NASA in late 1960 and (after the Kennedy administration waselected) to Congress in April 1961.One area of unusual interest covered in the report—easily overlooked amidmountains of interminable statistics and analyses—was a quiet assessment of thenear-certainty of a NASA discovery of intelligent extraterrestrial life: “Whileface-to-face meetings with it [extra-terrestrial life] will not occur within thenext twenty years (unless its technology is more advanced than ours, qualifyingit to visit Earth), artifacts left at some point in time by these life-formsmight possibly be discovered through our [NASA’s] space activities on the moon,Mars, or Venus.” [Italics added.]This quietly inserted subsection of Brookings is revealing on many levels, andit forms the documented basis of our case—that the NASA “you thought you knew”doesn’t actually exist, and that NASA has been deliberately concealing andclassifying its most significant discoveries because of “national security”rationales.Brookings officially affirmed NASA’s expectations that the agency would fly tonearby planets in the solar system, and would thus be physically capable, forthe first time, of confronting “extraterrestrials” right in their backyard.Did any skeptics even know that this official document existed before we made itpublic in 1996? Beginning in the mid-1960s with unmanned spacecraft, NASAactually discovered its projected extraterrestrial artifacts—but the agencynever got around to telling the rest of us!NASA would clandestinely confirm with these earliest robotic probes, and thenproceed to cover up, the first awesome remains of an extraordinary,solar-system-wide, ancient technological civilization on the moon—precisely asBrookings had predicted. Four years later, the Apollo Program would come to fullfruition, and the lunar astronauts themselves would personally witness andextensively document, with tens of thousands of high quality photographs, fromboth lunar orbit and the surface, extraordinary “glasslike” structures on themoon! The Apollo crews would not only bring back rocks to NASA laboratories, butactual samples of the ancient technologies they found—for highly classifiedefforts at “back engineering.”At this point, a skeptic might well ask how we can be presenting valid, officialNASA images of suppressed ruins and technology if the agency has spent so muchtime and energy over the past forty years covering them up. The answer is thatafter two generations, leaked images—displaying stunning details of ancientlunar structures arching overhead, as well as key alien artifacts that have beenbrought back—have also suddenly begun appearing on the Internet, on officialNASA websites!A small cadre of loyal NASA employees was witness to what actually went on, andagreed at that time to keep the secret in the interest of national security.Some of these NASA employees, apparently, have finally “seen the light”—thatthis continued deception, no matter what the legal rationale or nationalsecurity implications, was fundamentally extra-Constitutional. Because of thesetrue NASA heroes, real space history is about to officially begin, again.Based on our analysis as presented in this book, it is also our opinion thatNASA’s entire lunar exploration program—culminating with the incrediblysuccessful manned Apollo Project—was carefully conceived, from the beginning, asa kind of “alien reconnaissance” followed by an “alien artifacts retrieval”program.Again, the intention to do just that was blatantly laid out in Brookings. We nowbelieve that this is the reason President John F. Kennedy—reported to be“totally disinterested in space”—was quietly convinced to announce his historicdecision to “send men to the moon . . . and return them safely to the Earth . .. within a decade” in May of 1961. This was widely believed, then and now, to beKennedy’s effort to demonstrate to the world the superiority of the Americansystem, as opposed to Soviet communism. However, at the United Nations onSeptember 20, 1963, the president suddenly issued a public invitation to theSoviets only two years into the Apollo “race” to the moon: an offer of a“cooperative, joint U.S./ USSR lunar expedition.”Of course, if there were a “hidden agenda” to Apollo, this move would haverevealed that the prime objective was not to beat the Soviet Union, but tocovertly find and return samples of the incredibly advanced lunar technologythat had been waiting on the moon for eons . . . and then to share them with theSoviets! Curiously enough, a mere two months following Kennedy’s startling UNproposition, the president was killed.The enthusiastic architects of the continuing NASA Brookings cover-up, in part,are the same heroes we have been encouraged to worship as some of the leadingpioneers of our technological era. Their names are synonymous with America’sachievements in space science and rocket engineering. In many cases, they arealso men with secret pasts—Germans, Egyptians, Englishmen, and Americans, men atthe very fringes of rational thought and conventional wisdom. These literal“fringe elements,” then, are divided into three main groups inside the agency,as best as we can tell at present. For the purposes of this volume, we shallcall them the “Magicians,” the “Masons,” and the “Nazis”—and deal with eachgroup separately.Each “sect” is led by prominent individuals, and supported by lesser-knownplayers. Each has stamped their own agenda on our space program, in indeliblebut traceable ways. And each, remarkably, is dominated by a secret or “occult”doctrine that is far more closely aligned with “ancient religion and mysticism”than it is with the rational science and cool empiricism these men promote tothe general public as NASA’s overriding mantra.Using commercially available celestial mechanics/astronomical software—programslike the popular “Red Shift” series (which uses the official JPL ephemeris asits database)—we have been able to establish a pattern of behavior on NASA’spart that points to something as truly inexplicable as it is exotic: a bizarreinternal obsession by the agency with three “gods” and “goddesses,” reachingacross the millennia directly from ancient Egypt—Isis, Osiris, and Horus.It is these same three Egyptian gods (whose mythic story has been documented bymany Egyptologists and authors) that are also key to understanding the historyof the Masonic Order. It is this same mythology that is also at the heart of thebelief systems of the NASA Magicians and Nazis as well. This ritual Egyptiansymbolism, secretly practiced by NASA throughout these past five decades,publicly shows up only in its repeated, blatant choices of simple mission patchdesigns.For instance, if one looks at the official patch for the Apollo Program, armedwith our preceding “heads-up” regarding the bizarre NASA focus on all things“Egyptian,” it becomes elemental to match the “A” (for “Apollo”) as an actualstand-in for “Asar”—the Egyptian designation for “Osiris.” This successfuldecoding of the hidden Egyptian meaning of the Apollo patch is redundantlyconfirmed—because “Asar/Osiris” is none other than the familiar Greekconstellation of “Orion”—which is, of course, the background stellarconstellation on the patch itself.These continuing, inexplicable “secret society” manipulations inside NASA—notonly of its personnel, but also of its major policies—have been going on sinceits Congressional formation, and all with this inexplicable “Egyptian focus.”The evidence that NASA is “something other than the benevolent civilian scienceinstitution it pretends to be” is as overwhelming now as it is disturbing. Inthe years following JFK’s assassination, when Apollo finally became anengineering reality, only nine successful Apollo missions to and from the moonwere carried out; only six of those were actually lunar landings.Then (apparently), a critical number and type of lunar artifacts weresuccessfully identified, and returned to Earth by the Apollo crews—at whichpoint the entire Apollo Program was abruptly terminated with Apollo 17. In ourmodel, it was this successful completion of Apollo’s secret mission and agenda,and not Congressional budget cuts, that was the real reason for the abruptcessation of America’s historic journeys to the moon, and the primary reason noone has gone near the lunar surface for over thirty years.All of which made the sudden announcement by President George W. Bush of a newWhite House/NASA program “to return to the moon by 2020,” made at NASAheadquarters on January 14, 2004, so incredibly intriguing. What did the Bushadministration know, thirty years after the termination of Apollo, regardingwhat was waiting on the moon for human beings to return to? And was this whythis administration mounted an Apollo-style program “on steroids”—as NASAadministrator Mike Griffin, specifically appointed by President Bush to head thenew lunar return program—wryly termed it?Was NASA’s sudden interest in returning to the moon actually an effort to beat ahost of other countries with the same goal? Countries that independently,suddenly announced their plans to go to the moon—countries like China, India,Japan, and Russia, and even the European Space Agency? Is this the start of asecond space race, a race not for mere propaganda victories this time, but amuch more important race, among a much wider field of players, for sole accessto the scientific secrets the set of surviving lunar structures surveyed byApollo must inevitably contain—which, to those who successfully decode what theydiscover this time, could mean the ultimate domination of the Earth?It was just a few years after the start of the Apollo missions that even moreextraordinary solar system ruins were first observed on Mars—beginning withimages and other instrumented scans sent back by NASA’s first Mars orbiter, theunmanned Mariner 9 spacecraft, in late 1971.This earliest robotic confirmation that there was also something “anomalous” onMars paved the way for far more extensive observations when the first Vikingorbiters and landers arrived half a decade later. The critical thing here isthat, in direct contradiction to everything the press and the American peoplewere being led to believe that NASA stood for—program transparency, openscientific inquiry, freedom of publication—the agency quietly and methodicallycovered up the most astonishing wonders it had found.Many of NASA’s consulting sociologists and anthropologists to Brookings (likeDr. Margaret Mead, whom I had the privilege of actually working with, in lateryears, at New York’s Hayden Planetarium) had been warning NASA, even asBrookings was being researched and assembled, of “the enormous potential forsocial instability” if the existence of bona fide extraterrestrials—or evenruins they left behind—was officially revealed in the socially repressive andheavily religious environment of the late 1950s.With those first Lunar Orbiter images taken of the moon, everything—the realityof ruins, their extraordinary scale, their obvious presence on more than oneworld in the solar system, how their builders vanished—was suddenly all tooreal. There had been a powerful, enormously encompassing, extraordinarysolarsystem-wide civilization that had simply disappeared, only to berediscovered by NASA’s primitive initial probes. A civilization that, it wouldturn out later, had been wiped out through a series of all-encompassing,solar-system-wide cataclysms.The most disturbing part of Brookings to policy makers, however—even beforethese shattering discoveries were verified—was its thinly-veiled, authoritativewarnings regarding what could happen to our civilization if NASA’s 1950s-style“ET predictions” were confirmed:“Anthropological files contain many examples of societies, sure of their placein the universe, which have disintegrated when they had to associate withpreviously unfamiliar societies espousing different ideas and different lifeways; others that survived such an experience usually did so by paying the priceof changes in values and attitudes and behavior. . . . The literaldisintegration of society— simply from knowing that ‘we’re not alone.’” [Italicsadded.]The Brookings discussion of the implications of such a crucial discovery alsoencompassed a critical second-level problem: What to do if the agency, at somepoint in the future, actually made such a momentous, world-changing confirmationof extraterrestrial intelligence next door? Or even of their surviving ruins andartifacts?NASA’s discussion of these problems before they occurred—and the draconianmeasures it was seriously considering—is revealing: “Studies might help toprovide programs for meeting and adjusting to the implications of such adiscovery. Questions one might wish to answer by such studies would include: Howmight such information, under what circumstances, be presented to or withheldfrom the public, for what ends? What might be the role of the discoveringscientists and other decision makers regarding release of the fact ofdiscovery?” [Italics added.]Following the political tumult and excitement of the first successful Apollolunar landings, the White House and NASA dramatically changed the direction ofthe entire space program—under the excuse of a lack of public interest andinsufficient funding. The agency quickly dropped any pretense of following up onthe Apollo Program with permanent bases on the moon, as well as indefinitelypostponing all discussion and plans for going on to Mars.Instead, under the now-proven lie of developing an economical, reliable,reusable space transportation system, and a “worldclass” space researchlaboratory for it to resupply—the space shuttle and the International SpaceStation—NASA collaborated with the White House in a fateful set of decisions inthe early 1970s that would consign American astronauts to endlessly circle theEarth for decades, while the moon—with stunning ruins and bits and pieces of amiraculous, preserved technology orbiting just a quarter of a million milesaway—was totally ignored.On February 15, 2001, FOX aired a widely advertised show titled ConspiracyTheory: Did We Land on the Moon? With this program, FOX removed the last weaklink in NASA’s ongoing, forty-year-old chain of overlapping cover-ups. It is ourassertion that this “moon hoax” tale was carefully constructed as an elegantpiece of professional disinformation—as a desperately required distraction fromthe real lunar conspiracy documented here, which was beginning to seriouslyunravel as early as 1996. I can personally testify that I was a firsthandwitness to the true beginnings of “the moon hoax” far, far earlier than the 2001FOX special—back in 1969, and in the heart of NASA itself!The occasion was the unforgettable Apollo summer of Neil Armstrong and BuzzAldrin’s epic journey to the moon—the amazing July landing of Apollo 11. I, ofcourse, had been deeply immersed in all aspects of our CBS coverage of theupcoming Apollo 11 mission for months, as official science advisor to CBS NewsSpecial Events and chief correspondent Walter Cronkite.For the actual flight of Apollo 11, I was assigned (at my own request) to theDowney, California, facility of the prime contractor for the ApolloCommand/Service Module, North American Rockwell. I was there to personallyoversee construction and special effects use of my pet project for our nonstopCBS coverage of “Lunar Landing Day”—a “walk-through solar system” constructed byNorth American Rockwell technicians specifically for myself and CBS in a huge,drafty aircraft hanger. It was in this miniature, re-created version of thesolar system that I had successfully proposed that Walter Cronkite interview,via satellite, key engineers, project managers, and “special guests”—those whohad built the Apollo spacecraft at North American or who had special knowledgein the realm of history and space—to comment on the historic legacy of theApollo 11 flight.One luminary I was proud to bring before the cameras, to chat with Walter in NewYork regarding the extraordinary nature of events occurring that historic night,was Robert A. Heinlein, the dean of American science fiction. Decades earlier,Bob had cowritten the screenplay for Destination Moon, one of the firsttechnically accurate film depictions of the lunar journey then unfolding on livetelevision before a billion people all over planet Earth. As the successfulauthor of a pioneering series of “juvenile” science fiction novels that, for thefirst time, introduced realistic space travel and engineering concepts to anentire generation of future NASA scientists and engineers, Heinlein had, almostsingle-handedly, “inspired the workforce” for the entire space program.I must admit, I had a certain smug satisfaction that night, watching BobHeinlein stroll through “the solar system,” emphatically predicting to Walterand literally the world, via satellite, that “henceforth, this night—July 20,1969—will be known as ‘the Beginning of the True History of Mankind.’”After the heady events of that unforgettable thirty-two hours—the landing; theeerie extravehicular activity (EVA), complete with ghostly television shots“live from the moon”; and then, after the crew had slept for a few hours for thefirst time on the moon, the successful liftoff of the Eagle Lunar Module andrendezvous with the Command Module Columbia, still in lunar orbit—CBS moved ourunit up the street, to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena. There wewould cover the remainder of the flight, arriving at JPL right after the threeApollo 11 astronauts blasted home toward Earth and their “splashdown” in theSouth Pacific three days later.The reason was that NASA had another mission under way during the “Epic Journeyof Apollo 11”—a flyby of two unmanned Mariner spacecraft past Mars, for only thesecond time in NASA’s history.With only one CBS Special Events Unit in California, to cover all of NASA’sspace activities on the West Coast in those years, it was up to our small groupin Los Angeles—a producer, a correspondent, a couple of camera guys, maybe acouple of technicians, a makeup person, and me—to overlap our continuingcoverage of Apollo 11, now originating from the Theodore von Kármán Auditoriumat JPL, with new commentary covering the second unmanned NASA mission to do aflyby of Mars in history.Mariner 6 was to cruise past Mars on July 31—recording television images, makingspectral scans, conducting remote atmospheric measurements—just ten days afterthe Columbia left lunar orbit, heading for the Pacific Ocean. Our arrival at JPLon the afternoon of July 22, in preparation for this Mariner 6 flyby, was headystuff for a twenty-three-year-old network science consultant, as this was myfirst “in-person” tour to cover an actual live mission.The circumstances of my first flyby live from JPL are etched indelibly in mybrain, if for no other reason than it was the moment when television lightningstruck. One morning our executive producer, Bob Wussler, suddenly decided to putme on the air across the entire CBS television network to explain the upcomingMariner flyby to the nation! How could one ever forget their first professionalnetwork television appearance—and their first official network commentary for aNASA mission flying by Mars, no less? But for the life of me, I can’t remember athing I said that morning. I do remember that I literally had to borrow a sportcoat and tie from one of the floor crew for my first appearance on networktelevision.And, I vividly remember a bizarre scene that happened only a couple of daysbefore at JPL, as we arrived.It was controlled bedlam. Close to a thousand print reporters, televisioncorrespondents, technicians, special VIPs, as well as half the staff at JPLitself, were all attempting to register for the limited seating in the(relatively) small von Kármán Auditorium, which had been the scene for all livenetwork coverage of JPL’s previous extravaganzas ever, since Explorer 1 had beenplaced in orbit by a U.S. Army/JPL team one January night in 1958.This warm July afternoon only eleven years later, it seemed that everyone was ina mad scramble—simultaneously—to register at the lobby desks specifically set upfor members of the press, trying to grab the limited number of press kits on themission, and then nail down a seat in the auditorium beyond.It was at this point, as I was drifting around von Kármán, trying to spot wherethe CBS anchor desk was positioned, that I noticed something strange. Even to myuntrained eye, it looked out of place: a man, wearing jeans and a long,light-colored raincoat (it was typical Los Angeles weather outside—so, why thecoat?). This man, wearing one of those floppy “great coats” that cowpunchersused to wear in old Westerns, complete with a dark leather bag slung over oneshoulder, was slowly, methodically, placing “something” on each chair in vonKármán.As he got closer, I suddenly realized that he was accompanied by a moreconventionally dressed representative from JPL itself—coatless, in white shirtand black tie—the second figure was, in fact, none other than the head of theJPL press office, Frank Bristow. In the midst of all the commotion, why wasBristow—again, the head of the JPL press office—personally squiring this veryout-of-place individual around the auditorium?Then, as if that wasn’t mystery enough, Bristow began moving “great coat guy”back out to the cramped pressroom area beyond the glassed-in foyer of theauditorium. There, in an office where space correspondents like Walter Sullivan(New York Times), Frank Pearlman (San Francisco Chronicle), Jules Bergmann(ABC), and Bill Stout (our local guy from CBS) hung out, and wrote their leadsand copy after each formal press briefing held in von Kármán itself, a handfulof reporters were now being introduced, again by Bristow, to “great coat guy.”Why was the official head of the JPL press office doing this?I soon had my answer.As Bristow watched approvingly, his “guest” proceeded to hand each availablereporter a copy of whatever he’d been putting on the seats back in theauditorium.As I opened up the handout, something yellow and silvery fell on the tile floor.It was a shiny American flag, maybe four inches lengthwise, made of aluminizedmylar. I turned to the couple of mimeographed pages and began to read—andcouldn’t believe my eyes.The date was July 22, 1969. The three Apollo 11 astronauts, Neil Armstrong, BuzzAldrin, and Mike Collins—two of whom had just successfully walked on “thefrigging moon” and wouldn’t splash down in the South Pacific for two moredays—were still halfway between Earth and the “Sea of Tranquillity.” Yet here,someone with an obvious “in” to JPL was handing out a mimeographed broadsheet toall the real reporters . . . claiming “NASA has just faked the entire Apollo 11Lunar Landing . . . on a soundstage in Nevada!”And, if that wasn’t weird enough, this individual was being personally escortedaround von Kármán by none other than the head of the JPL press office himself! Idid what I saw the other veterans do: I casually threw the two pages in thetrash and tucked the shiny flag into my notebook . . . but the seed had beenplanted.Looking back, based on all our hard-won knowledge of what is really “out there”in the solar system, and experiencing the outrageous lengths NASA will go tokeep “the secret,” I can now put the pieces together.This was an official Op—Bristow’s job was to make sure that all the nationalreporters covering NASA at least saw what was handed out that afternoon,complete with shiny flag to act as a mnemonic device to trigger the memory ofwhat was in the pamphlet long after it was history. Sooner or later, apercentage of those who read it that afternoon at JPL would write it up—as aquirky angle on the far-too-dry official tale of Apollo 11.In this way, it would become a naturally reproducing meme—“a unit of culturalinformation, such as a cultural practice or idea, that is transmitted verballyor by repeated action from one mind to another”—which is exactly what NASAapparently intended to plant at JPL that afternoon, deliberately to “infect”American culture with the story that “the moon landing was all a fake!”Was this all some far seeing “back-up plan” if, in some point in the future, itstarted to emerge why the astronauts had really gone to the moon?FOX, the “fair and balanced” network, activated the meme in 2001 with the Did WeLand on the Moon? special. There, waiting in the wings, was a neatly packagedthirty-year-old “conspiracy theory” perfectly gift-wrapped for those finallybeginning to “disbelieve” in NASA. An officially concocted “inoculation” againsttroublemakers who would one day place before many of those same nationalreporters a set of embarrassing official Apollo photographs, asking the crucialquestion: “What did NASA really find during its Apollo missions to the moon?”"},{"pageContent":"S E V E NHISTORY AND CELESTIAL TIMEDOES PRECESSION CAUSE THE RISE AND FALL OF CIVILIZATION?WALTER CRUTTENDENDiscoveries like the ancient Greek Antikythera Device (1,500 years before theinvention of precision geared devices), the Baghdad Batteries (two thousandyears before Volta “invented” the battery), or dental and brain surgeryartifacts found in ancient Pakistan (eight thousand years out of historicalsequence) appear “anomalous” within our current paradigm of history. However,they are not unexpected according to the ancient cyclical view.Giorgio de Santillana, a former professor of the history of science at MIT,tells us that most ancient cultures believed consciousness and history were notlinear but cyclical, meaning they would rise and fall over long periods of time.In his landmark work Hamlet’s Mill, Giorgio de Santillana and coauthor Herthavon Dechend showed that the myth and folklore of over thirty ancient culturesaround the world spoke of a vast cycle of time with alternating Dark and GoldenAges that move with the precession of the equinox. Plato called this the GreatYear.Although the idea of a great cycle timed by the slow precession of the equinoxwas common to multiple cultures before the Christian era, most of us were taughtthat this is just a fairy tale—there was no Golden Age. However, an increasingbody of new astronomical and archaeological evidence suggests that the cycle mayhave a basis in fact. More important, understanding the cycle might provideinsight into where society is headed at this time and why consciousness may beexpanding at an exponential rate. Understanding the cause of precession is keyto understanding the cycle.The standard theory of precession says it is principally the moon’s gravityacting upon the oblate Earth that must be the cause of the Earth’s changingorientation to inertial space, otherwise known as the “precession of theequinox.” However, ancient sources say that the observable of an equinox slowlymoving or “precessing” through the twelve constellations of the zodiac is simplydue to the motion of the solar system through space (changing our viewpoint fromEarth). At the Binary Research Institute, we have modeled a moving solar systemand found that it does indeed better produce the precession observable (thesun’s motion relative to the fixed stars as seen from Earth), and resolves anumber of solar system anomalies such as the uneven distribution of angularmomentum within the solar system and the variable rate of precession.Beyond the technical considerations, a moving solar system might provide alogical reason why we have a Great Year with alternating Dark and Golden Ages.That is, if the solar system carrying the Earth actually moves in a huge orbit,subjecting the Earth to the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum of another star or EMsource along the way, we could expect that this would affect our magnetosphere,ionosphere, and—indirectly—all life, in a pattern commensurate with that orbit.Just as the Earth’s smaller diurnal and annual motions produce the cycles of dayand night and the seasons (both due to the Earth’s changing position in relationto the electromagnetic spectrum of the sun), so might the larger celestialmotion be expected to produce a cycle that affects life and consciousness on agrand scale.The hypothesis for how consciousness would be affected in such a celestial cyclebuilds on the work of Dr. Valerie Hunt, former professor of physiology at UCLA.In a number of studies, she has found that changes in the ambientelectromagnetic field (which surrounds us all the time) can dramatically affecthuman cognition and performance. In short, consciousness is affected byimmersion in electromagnetic fields. Consequently, the concept behind the GreatYear or cyclical model of history, consistent with myth and folklore, is basedon the sun’s motion through space, subjecting the Earth to waxing and waningstellar fields (all stars are huge generators of electromagnetic spectrum),resulting in the legendary rise and fall of the ages over great epochs of time.We looked at some of the ancient myths about rising and falling ages tied to theprecession cycle, explored current precession anomalies, outlined a dynamicsolar system model that better explains the precession observable, and suggesteda hypothesis for how a change in proximity to stellar-generated electromagneticfields might be the mechanism that induces cyclical changes on Earth. We wouldhere like to use this model as a guide to better understand where we have beenin terms of consciousness and ancient civilizations in the past, and moreimportant, where we are going in the future. As Graham Hancock stated, this“new—or very old—approach to the greatest problems of human history” could be a“key to the mystery of the ages.”HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVECurrent theories of history generally ignore myth and folklore and do notconsider any macro-external influences on consciousness. For the most part,modern historical theory teaches us that consciousness or history moves in alinear pattern from primitive to modern with few exceptions. Some of its tenetsinclude:Mankind evolved out of Africa.People were hunter-gatherers until about five thousand years ago.Tribes first banded together for protection from other warring parties.Written communication must precede any large engineered structures or populouscivilizations.The problem with this widely accepted paradigm is that it is not consistent withthe evolving interpretation of recently discovered ancient cultures andanomalous artifacts. In the last hundred years, major discoveries have been madein Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, the Asian plains, South American sites, and inmany other regions that break the rules of historical theory and push back thetime of advanced human development. Specifically, they show that ancient man wasfar more proficient and civilized nearly five thousand years ago than he wasduring the more recent Dark Ages of just a thousand years ago.In Caral, an ancient complex on the west coast of Peru, we find six pyramidsthat are carbon-dated to be 4,700 years old, a date contemporaneous with theEgyptian pyramids and rivaling the time of the first major structures found inthe so-called cradle of civilization in Mesopotamia. However, Caral is an oceanaway from the “cradle,” and we find no evidence of any writing or weaponry, twoof the so-called necessities of civilization. At the same time, we do findbeautiful musical instruments, astronomically aligned structures, and evidenceof commerce with distant lands. Clearly, such sites defy the standard historicalparadigm—but what is stranger still is that so many of these civilizationsseemed to decline en masse.In ancient Mesopotamia; Pakistan; Jiroft, Iran; and adjacent lands, we seeknowledge of astronomy, geometry, advanced building techniques, sophisticatedplumbing and water systems, incredible art, dyes and fabrics, surgery, medicine,and many other refinements of a civilized culture that seemed to arise fromnowhere, yet were completely lost over the next few thousand years. By the timeof the worldwide Dark Ages, every one of these civilizations had turned tonomadic ways of life, or to dust. Near the depths of the downturn, there wereruins and little else to be found. And in some areas where larger populationsstill remained, such as throughout parts of Europe, poverty and disease wereoften rampant, and the ability to read, write, or duplicate any of the earlierengineering or scientific feats had essentially disappeared. What happened?While records of this period are still very spotty, the archaeological evidenceindicates consciousness, reflected as human ingenuity and capability, wasgreatly diminished. We just seemed to have lost the ability to do the things weused to do. Ironically, this is just what many ancient cultures predicted. Theworld’s foremost Assyrianologist, Stefan Maul, shed light on this phenomenon inhis Stanford Presidential Lecture when he told us that the Akkadians knew theylived in a declining era; they revered the past and tried to hang on to it, butat the same time lamented and predicted the Dark Ages that would follow. Hisetymological studies of cuneiform tablets show that the ancient words for “past”have now become our words for “future,” whereas their words for the “future”have now become our words for the “past.” It is almost as if mankind orients hismotion through time depending on whether he is in an ascending or descendingage.We find this principle of waxing and waning periods of time depicted in numerousbas-reliefs found in ancient Mithraic temples. The famed Tauroctany (orbull-slaying) scene is often surrounded by two boys, Cautes and Cautopetes. Oneholds a torch up on one side of the zodiac, indicating it is a time of light,the other holds a torch down on the other side of the zodiac, indicating it is atime of darkness. As the accompanying chart will show, these time periodscorrespond with the Vedic description of when the Earth goes through periods ofrising and falling consciousness.Jared Diamond, the well-known historian anthropologist and author of Guns,Germs, and Steel, makes a good case that it is primarily local geographic andenvironmental advantages on the planet Earth that determine which group ofhumans succeeds or fails versus another. Those that have the steel, guns, andbad germs win. While this helps explain many regional differences of the lastfew thousand years, it does not address the macro trends that seemed to haveaffected all cultures (including China and the Americas) as they slipped intothe last worldwide Dark Age.The cyclical or Great Year model overlays and augments Jared Diamond’sobservations, giving a reason for the widespread downturn. It suggests that itis not just the geography and environment of man on Earth that determines hisrelative success but it is also the geography and environment of the Earth inspace that affects mankind on a vast scale. Just as small celestial motionsaffect life over the short-term, so do large celestial motions affect us overthe long-term.Understanding that consciousness may indeed rise and fall with the motions ofthe heavens gives meaning to ancient myth and folklore and puts anomalousartifacts such as the Antikythera Device into an historical context that makessense. It speaks to why so many ancient cultures might have been fascinated withthe stars, and it provides us with a workable paradigm in which to understandhistory. It could also help us identify the forces that propelled theRenaissance, and that may be accelerating consciousness in the current era. Mythand folklore, the scientific language of yore, provide a colorful look atconsciousness throughout the different ages.CHARACTER OF THE AGESThe Greek historian Hesiod tells us of the wonderful nature of the last GoldenAge, when “peace and plenty” abounded. Hopi myths tell us of cities on thebottom of the sea. Typically ancient peoples broke the great cycle into anascending and descending phase, each with four periods. For example, the Vedicor Hindu culture tells us that when the autumnal equinox moves from Virgo toAires, we go through the ascending Kali, Dwapara, Treta, and Satya (Golden Age)Yugas before slowly declining in reverse order as the equinox completes itsjourney. The Greeks and other early Mediterranean civilizations used similarperiods and labeled them the Iron, Bronze, Silver, and Golden Ages. More distantcultures, such as the Maya or Hopi, used still other names, such as “worlds” or“suns,” and labeled them “fourth or fifth” to identify the recent epochs.A relatively modern proponent of the cyclical system was the Sanskrit sage SwamiSri Yukteswar, author of The Holy Science. He taught that the position of oursolar system relative to another star now indicates that we are in recenttransition from the lowest material age, the Kali Yuga, into the electrical oratomic age, the Dwapara Yuga. In this period, it is said that we begin to seethe world as more transparent as we move from an awareness of self as a physicalbody in a strictly physical universe, to an awareness that we are somethingmore, living in a universe filled with subtle forces and energies.The technological discoveries of the laws of gravity, electricity, andmagnetism, just in the last few hundred years, give this idea credence—and thetrend is accelerating. In the last century it has even been discovered thatphysical matter is not really solid at all. We have found that it is made ofmolecules, and that these are in turn made of atoms, which are themselvesconstituted of 99.9 percent empty space. The little bit of matter that doesexist in the heart of the proton and neutron is now thought to be principallyvibrating energy, at least according to the latest version of string theory.Indeed, reality is looking more and more ethereal, just as the hoary Vedaspredicted.Ages beyond the present are difficult to grasp, because a lesser consciousnesscannot behold a greater consciousness any more than a cup of water cannot holdthe ocean—so we tend to extrapolate the past material view of things whenenvisioning the future. Yet the Oriental teachings about cycles indicate thatthis is just a passing phase. They say the real trend is toward a godlike statewhere the physical is but a manifestation of something from the other world. Andso it seems when we read Greek mythology or pages of Vedic scripture.The Silver Age or Treta Yuga, the third age (from the bottom) is the Greek “ageof the demigods,” or, to the yogis of India, the age of divine magnetism and themind. While this is a difficult concept to grasp, consider the story of Babel.Supposedly, before Babel (pre–3100 BCE in the last descending Treta Yuga)humanity spoke with one tongue and communed freely with nature. The Hebrewscriptures tell us that mankind began to build “towers,” and then languages were“confused” and people could no longer understand one another (Genesis 11:1–9).In the standard theory of history this story makes no sense, but in the cyclicalmodel it has great meaning. It would have occurred around the time of the firsttower buildings in ancient Mesopotamia, probably between 3500 BCE and 3000 BCE.This is precisely around the time (3100 BCE) when, according to Sri Yukteswar,the world declined from the descending Treta Yuga into the descending DwaparaYuga, a time when clairvoyance and telepathy were lost. We learn fromParamahansa Yogananda, another proponent of the yuga cycle and the famed authorof Autobiography of a Yogi, that this time will come again in the year 4100 CE,when we pass from the ascending Dwapara and into the ascending Treta Yuga. Hetells us that at this time there will once again be a “common knowledge oftelepathy and clairvoyance.” Perhaps then we will better understand the meaningof the ancient myths.The Treta Yuga is said to be the age of levitation, telepathy, a time of theshamans and wizards of old, when tremendous psychic and mental abilities werecommon, truly an “age of the demigods.” We’ve all heard stories about themythical powers of the saints and sages who had these gifts. Now seen as rare,the majority of people don’t take these reports seriously or realize that we,too, might have this same latent ability in a higher state of consciousness.Yet, this is exactly what the ancients told us. In fact, Christ was quoting thefar more ancient Hebrew scriptures when, in the depths of the last Dark Age, hesaid, “Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?” He himself embodiedthis consciousness when he said, “He that believeth on me, the works that I doshall he do also.”The final stage in the cycle of time is the Golden Age or Satya Yuga. It isconsidered the highest time on Earth. If the Treta or Silver Age isinconceivable to us today, then the Golden Age must sound like a myth or adream. The Greeks called it the “age of the gods,” and the myth and folklore ofthe Vedas and ancient Egypt hint that this was a time when gods literally walkedthe Earth, and most of mankind lived in perfect harmony with nature and theheavens. While there now remains very little physical evidence of this long-agoperiod, we do find that virtually every ancient megalithic construction prior tothe year 1500 BCE seems to be oriented toward some astronomical or cardinalpoint. Going back further, there are signs that multiple structures may havebeen aligned to mirror constellations or the larger heavens.The Golden Age is said to be a time when we could perceive and communicate withastral or causal realms, and directly know God without the intermediacy of anyreligion. Again, this sounds like little more than a fairy tale given ourcurrent state of consciousness, but it is a theme common to ancient peoples whospoke and wrote of the long-lost higher ages.PREDICTIVE VALUEAdmittedly, the higher ages sound incredible, but we hope to show evidence atthe next Conference on Precession and Ancient Knowledge (CPAK), and throughfuture papers, books, and films, that the cycle has a basis in fact, driven bythe solar system’s motion through space. Just as the seasons of the year, causedby the Earth’s orbit around the sun, can be forecast in time (through calendarsand various astronomical means), so can the seasons of the Great Year becalculated by the slow precession of the equinox.The cyclical model is not only precisely measurable (by monitoring the annualchange in the precession rate, now about 50.29 arc seconds per year) but Ibelieve that it has predictive value. There are many changes we can expect overthe next few decades to few thousand years as we progress through the GreatYear. Research into these changes is based on cross-interpretations of myth andfolklore, extrapolation of trends, and interviews with futurists. During thecurrent transition from the Kali Yuga (of gross material consciousness) to theearly Dwapara Yuga (where an awareness of energy and finer forces will bedominant), we are manifesting our heightened awareness and increasing ingenuitythrough an endless array of technology that allows us to annihilate the barriersof time and space. We can now fly just about anywhere on the globe within thetime it takes the planet to make one spin on its axis. Likewise, we caninstantly communicate with someone on the other side of the Earth and send thema picture or video of almost any event, real time. All these things were notonly impossible but also unthinkable just a hundred years ago.Underlying this trend, there is actually a greater concern for nature. We willsee, more and more, a return to living in tune with Mother Earth—and it will befacilitated by greater understanding and thinner technology. As technologybecomes something hidden in the background, we can expect some amazing changes.For example, while we currently still need antennas to transmit communications(and soon power) or silicon to compute or store information, even these may beoutmoded in the future.Physicist John Dering (a CPAK regular) has speculated that given the trend ofcomputer power, sometime in the not too distant future we will develop interfacedevices that allow us to pick up the waveforms captured by trees or the antennaeof bugs, and we may be able to tap into and decipher all the information(waveforms) that have ever passed by a rock or any inanimate object in thelandscape. Could it be that our ancient ancestors better understood the subtlequalities of stone?Another CPAK author, John Burke, has already shown that ancient cultures had atremendous knowledge of electromagnetism as evidenced by the outer stones atAvebury, where he has demonstrated that all of the standing stones’ magneticpoles are identically aligned. He has also shown that some Indian shamans in theAmerican West can find areas of high electrostatic charge or geophysicaldiscontinuities just by feel. They use these areas for healing purposes.Contemplating these ideas gives new meaning to the stories of our ancientancestors. Understanding their wisdom may be the key to understanding ourfuture."},{"pageContent":"E I G H TTHE ORION KEYUNLOCKING THE MYSTERY OF GIZASCOTT CREIGHTONUPSETTING THE APPLE CARTIt has long been the view of mainstream Egyptologists that the siting of each ofthe main pyramid structures at Giza was determined purely upon the wishes of thepharaoh and the practicalities and logistics of a particular site. It is furtherheld that the King’s decision for the siting of his pyramid gave little or noconsideration to structures that had gone before or that would come after. Eachpyramid at Giza—so the conventional view asserts—was effectively constructed asa discreet royal funerary complex by each successive pharaoh, and was done sowithout reference to any long-term master site plan. In short, we are told thatthe pyramids at Giza were constructed as “singularities” and that there existedno grand architectural scheme; no grand plan.This conventional view of the pyramids at Giza runs contrary to the work ofRobert Bauval who, in 1994—in partnership with Adrian Gilbert—published TheOrion Mystery, his first book, which presented the radical hypothesis that thepyramids at Giza were constructed as symbolic representations of the three Beltstars of the constellation of Orion. By advocating such a hypothesis, Bauval wasinvoking the almost heretical notion that each of the pyramids at Giza wereconstructed as component parts of a long-term project; a multigenerationalmaster plan that involved the Belt stars of the constellation of Orion.It is unsurprising that in making such a bold hypothesis, Bauval quicklyincurred the wrath of the academic establisment. With a few notable exceptions,Egyptologists remained largely unconvinced of Bauval’s proposal, dismissing muchof the cultural evidence he presented from the ancient Egyptian writings knownas the Pyramid Texts, which provided considerable textual support to his work.The Egyptologists demanded that Bauval present conclusive evidence in support ofhis Orion hypothesis before they would even remotely consider overturning morethan a century of Egyptological consensus that staunchly regarded the Gizapyramids as three discreet royal funerary complexes built entirely independentlyof each other.Robert Bauval, however, remains steadfast in his view. Almost fifteen yearsafter publishing The Orion Mystery, I met with Bauval in the shadow of the GreatPyramid and asked him his opinion concerning a very obvious anomaly at Giza. “IfKhufu was the first pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty to build at Giza,” I put it tohim, “why, then, didn’t Khufu construct his Great Pyramid on the prestigious,high ground in the center of the plateau?”Bauval turned to me with his characteristic enigmatic smile, and replied,“Because, Scott—there was a plan.”In Keeper of Genesis/Message of the Sphinx, the authors show how this “grandplan” may also have included the Great Sphinx at Giza, which they hypothesizemight have been designed as a reflection of the lion constellation of Leo in theeastern sky circa 10,500 BCE. It seems that the designers of the Great Sphinxmay have used the constellation of Leo as the underlying template for the designof this most recondite of all Giza structures. On this basis, might it not thenbe possible that the designers may have used the Orion’s Belt stars not simplyto lay the pyramids on the ground in a near identical pattern to the Belt stars,but to also use the Belt stars as the underlying template from which to generatethe actual dimensions—the base shape—of all three main Giza pyramids?It hardly needs to be stated, but if it can be demonstrated that the Orion’sBelt stars can indeed be used to simply and easily generate three bases whosedimensions proportionally match those of all three main Giza pyramids, then thiswould provide strong circumstantial evidence in support of Bauval’s Orionhypothesis.Yet can this be done? Is it possible that the three Orion’s Belt stars can—whenapplying a very simple geometrical technique—be used to produce three bases thatperfectly match the bases of the three Great Pyramids at Giza? We will shortlyinvestigate this idea, but for the moment let us consider some further“anomalies” that exist at Giza, for which there exist no convincing conventionalanswers.ANOMALIES ABOUNDAs already mentioned, if the final resting place of the pharaoh was simply amatter of his own personal choice, then we have to ask ourselves why Khufushould have chosen to locate his Great Pyramid at the very edge of the northeastcorner of the Giza Plateau. On the surface, this would not seem a particularlyodd choice. Looking closer, however, we find that the high, dominant ground liesin the center of the plateau where Khafre’s Pyramid stands. Not only is thiscentral area the commanding ground on the plateau, but it also benefits fromhaving a “natural causeway” that runs from the area of the Sphinx up to the eastface of Khafre’s Pyramid. Even today, Egyptologists refer to this area as the“gateway to Giza.”Why then, we ask, would Khufu choose to construct a quite monumental artificialcauseway deep into the valley, when a natural causeway already existed up to thehigh, commanding ground of the plateau and which—had Khufu utilized it forhimself—would have considerably eased the construction burden of his funerarycomplex?Furthermore, by failing to claim for himself the highest ground on the plateau,Khufu would have been fully aware that he was leaving the door open for somefuture pharaoh to trump his own achievement by potentially building a higherpyramid in that area, which, as matters transpired, is precisely whathappened—Khafre’s Pyramid appears larger than the Great Pyramid due to it havingbeen built on the central high ground of the plateau.The ancient Egyptians were—first and foremost—very practical builders. For Khufuto have decided against building his pyramid in the most practical andprestigious location on the plateau defies logic, and is entirely inconsistentand anomalous. Why would Khufu risk having the magnificence of his own grandstructure eclipsed by leaving the Giza door wide open for a future pharaoh tocome along and surpass his own achievement? It makes no sense.And why did Khafre—the builder of the second Giza pyramid—decide to return toGiza when his predecessor, Djedefre, did not build at Giza like his father,Khufu, but instead opted to build his pyramid at Abu Rawash? Indeed, Khafre wasthe first king of the Fourth Dynasty to “co-locate” at the site of anotherpharaoh (Khufu). Why did Khafre (and indeed, Menkaure) decide to build at Gizawhere—from a religious perspective—it would have seemed more consistent to haveco-located with Djedefre (the first king of the emerging solar cult to have thename of the sun god Re incorporated into the royal cartouche) at Abu Rawash?And finally, we have Menkaure’s Pyramid—the smallest of the three Great Pyramidsat Giza. Once again it defies basic human instinct that Menkaure would havewished to locate his own infinitely smaller structure in the shadow of the GreatPyramid and Khafre’s Pyramid, where its relatively diminutive stature would onlyhave been exacerbated by its close proximity to its two illustrious neighbors.Had Menkaure sited his own structure at a virgin site, he could have avoided theignoble fate that assuredly awaited his pyramid by deciding to build at Giza.Why would Menkaure commit to Giza in the full knowledge that the pyramid heplanned to build there would forever suffer the ignominy of having failed tomeet the high standards set by his predecessors? Again, it makes little sense.Another very obvious anomaly pertains to the two sets of three smaller satellitepyramids known as the “Queen’s Pyramids.” Three of these structures run in anorth/south line to the east of Khufu’s Pyramid, whilst the other set of threerun in an east/west line just south of Menkaure’s Pyramid.Khafre’s Pyramid has no queen’s pyramids at all. Why would this be when it isknown that Khafre actually had five wives? Five queens, and yet not a singlequeen’s pyramid is located at Khafre’s Pyramid! There seems no consistency, nologic to this anomaly.Of course, all of these anomalies, contradictions, and motives are simply andeasily explained by the prior existence of a grand, overall plan; a strict planthat the ancient Egyptians of the Fourth Dynasty—beginning with Khufu—feltcompelled, indeed “duty-bound,” to implement on the ground at Giza.From a purely logistical point of view, it would make sense to build Khufu’sPyramid first, since to commence the plan by building on the central high groundof the plateau would have presented a considerable obstruction to laterconstruction. Building had to begin in the northeast of the plateau toaccommodate the logistics of building the structures that would come later inthe plan. Given this constraint, Khufu—being the first to build at Giza—hadlittle choice but to build his pyramid on the lower ground in the northeast ofthe plateau. However, had there been no master plan for later structures, Khufuwould undoubtedly have taken full advantage of the prestigious high ground forhis own pyramid. Khufu’s peculiar actions tell us that his “hands were tied”—hewas constrained by the demands and logistics of a greater plan; a plan he wasseemingly powerless to influence.IN SEARCH OF THE MASTER KEYWhether the pyramids at Giza were constructed as “singularities” or as part ofsome greater scheme, it is not unreasonable to surmise that the builders wouldhave followed plans of some kind. Alas, no plans of any kind have ever beenrecovered.However, even in the absence of any actual plans, it may still be possible touncover the blueprint the ancient builders may have used to lay out and definethe dimensions of the Giza monuments—and we can perhaps achieve this byreverse-engineering the geometry of the in situ structures. The logic issimple—if the Giza pyramids were constructed as part of some overall “masterplan,” then it naturally follows that there would exist some guiding principlecommon to all three pyramids. Finding this “key” would hopefully lead to theunderlying design imperative—the blueprint—and show that the pyramids were notsimply placed in random fashion on the whim of three successive pharaohs.Over the years, the Internet has spawned a veritable plethora ofgeometrical-mathematical offerings that attempt to seek the answer to thequestion of how the three main Giza pyramid base dimensions were arrived at andhow the other satellite pyramids were placed. So far, however, none of theseofferings provides a complete, cohesive solution to this particular question.The master “key” to the Giza blueprint remains frustratingly elusive.It was stated in the opening to this article that Robert Bauval has long arguedthat the three main Giza pyramids were built and laid out on the ground at Gizaas symbolic representations of the three Belt stars of the Orionconstellation—not a perfect centerto-center correlation, but very close.Assuming, then, that Bauval’s hypothesis is correct, could it then be possiblethat the Orion’s Belt stars might reveal to us other aspects of the Giza pyramiddesign? Might it be possible that the Belt stars could have been used to definethe actual geometrical base dimensions of the three main Giza pyramids? Inshort—could the Orion’s Belt stars be the elusive design “key”; the underlyingGiza design imperative sought by so many for so long?Well, let’s see.THE ORION “GEO-STELLAR FINGERPRINT”Any three non-linear points (in this case the three stars of Orion’s Belt) canbe used to generate three square bases, simply and easily, using a techniquethat has come to be known as “geo-stellar fingerprinting.” Orion’s Belt starscan be used to produce their very own “geo-stellar fingerprint.”The dimensions of the three main pyramids at Giza are shown to proportionallyagree with the three bases produced by the Orion Geo-Stellar Fingerprint—a clearconnection between the Orion’s Belt stars and the pyramids at Giza. Furthermore,what we also find is that three lines can be passed through each of the threemain pyramids of the Geo-Stellar Fingerprint that allow us to also place theQueen’s Pyramids of Menkaure and Khufu.It seems somewhat ironic that the mathematical “solution” to the Giza layoutsought by so many over so many years was sought by some individuals to disproveBauval’s Orion hypothesis, and yet what we now find is that the Orion’s Beltstars actually held the key to the mathematical design solution—the Gizablueprint—that these individuals had been so keen to discover.Yet the Orion influence at Giza does not end there. There is more—much more.Whilst the Orion Geo-Stellar Fingerprint presents highly compelling evidence onits own of a direct (mathematical) connection between the three Giza pyramidsand the Orion’s Belt stars, independent corroboration of such an association isdesirable to further strengthen the hypothesis. If it could be shown that otherpyramid structures at Giza also have a demonstrable connection with the Orion’sBelt stars (with the obvious placement of these structures within the OrionGeo-Stellar Fingerprint) then this would provide the independent corroborationrequired to prove the Orion-Giza hypothesis—if not conclusively, then certainlybeyond any reasonable doubt.QUEENS OF PRECESSIONIt would seem that such independent corroboration can be found in the relativeplacement of the two sets of three “Queen’s Pyramids” on the plateau.Before presenting this corroborating evidence of an Orion association with thetwo sets of Queen’s Pyramids, it is important to first take a moment here tounderstand the astronomical phenomenon referred to by astronomers as“precession.”Most of us are familiar with the Earth’s daily (diurnal) rotation of twenty-fourhours. We are also familiar with its second motion, its annual 365-day rotation(orbit) around the sun. The Earth, however, possesses a third, much lessperceptible motion known as “precession.”When we look at the night sky, we observe the stars slowly rotating in acontinual east to west direction. Over some 13,000 years, however, the stars inour night sky actually slowly drift in a west to east (retrograde) directionbefore stopping and then, over a further 13,000 years, drift slowly back totheir point of origin—like the swing of a clock’s pendulum. The conventionalview of this “precessional drift” is that it occurs as a result of a very slowwobble of the Earth as it rotates around its axis.The end result of this “precessional drift” is to slowly shift the rising andsetting points of stars on the horizon over a long period of time—approximatelyone degree of precessional drift occurs every seventy-two years. One beneficialaspect of this precessional drift is that it can be utilized as a mechanism for“recording” time, for marking important dates. For example, by aligning twostone obelisks with a setting star precisely due south (180 degrees), we areeffectively marking that specific moment (date) in time. Over the passing yearsand decades, the target star continues its slow drift along the horizon, leavingthe alignment with the obelisks far behind. The obelisks no longer align withthe target star on the horizon but now serve as a “marker”—an astronomicalrecord—of when the alignment was made with the target star.By then observing where the target star sets (or rises) today—for example, at192 degrees—we can then extrapolate that it has drifted some 10 degrees from itsoriginal obelisk alignment of 180 degrees which, in turn, tells us that thealignment was created approximately 720 years in the past, since seventy-twoyears equals approximately one degree of precessional drift.Similarly, when we now consider the pyramid structures at Giza, we find a veryclear and unequivocal alignment of those structures with the Orion’s Belt starsas they appeared on the southwest horizon circa 10,500 BCE. Specifically, thisalignment involves the smallest of the three Great Pyramids—the Pyramid ofMenkaure—and its stellar counterpart, the belt star Mintaka in Orion’s Belt.Mintaka is the “target” star through which the Pyramid of Menkaure (our“obelisk”) is aligned.Circa 10,500 BCE, the star Mintaka set close to the southwest horizon 212degrees azimuth (212 degrees clockwise from due north). When considering theGiza pyramids, we find that the alignment from the apex of Khafre’s Pyramidthrough the apex of Menkaure’s Pyramid is also 212 degrees azimuth.At the very same moment, the three Queen’s Pyramids of Menkaure are placed in ahorizontal line close to the southwest horizon, thereby mimicking thearrangement of the three Belt stars which are similarly arranged at that precisemoment before setting on the southwest horizon.Significantly, this alignment with Menkaure/Mintaka and the Menkaure Queens withthe three Belt stars occurs at a very unique moment in the precessional“pendulum swing” of the Orion’s Belt stars. This quite unique moment—marked bythe 212 degrees Menkaure/Mintaka alignment and corroborated by the arrangementof Menkaure’s Queen’s Pyramids—is the very moment the Belt stars stop andreverse their precessional direction to begin their long 13,000 year journeyback to their point of origin. This unique moment, circa 10,500 BCE is known asthe precessional minimum culmination. After another 13,000 years drifting in theopposite direction, the Belt stars will reach their precessional maximumculmination, circa 2500 CE, and so the precessional pendulum swing of the Beltstars continues—forever.There is yet more evidence to present regarding this quite extraordinaryrelationship between the Giza pyramids and the Orion’s Belt stars. As alreadymentioned, the Belt stars swing across the sky like a clock’s pendulum, movingimperceptibly slowly between minimum and maximum precessional culminations. Wehave already observed how the Menkaure Queens have been placed as “markers” toindicate the precessional minimum culmination of the Orion’s Belt stars whenthese stars were aligned in horizontal fashion close to the southwest horizon.This then begs the obvious question—how and where will the Belt stars be alignedwhen rising at their precessional maximum culmination on the future date ofcirca 2500 CE?Consulting astronomical software, we find that the Belt stars will rise atmaximum culmination on the eastern horizon rotated 90 degrees (perpendicular) tothe stars setting at minimum culmination. Astonishingly, this is precisely thearrangement we find that the other three Queen’s Pyramids beside Khufu’s GreatPyramid have been placed in.It is also worth noting that in considering the Queen’s Pyramids as“precessional markers,” this might help explain the curious absence of anyqueen’s pyramids of Khafre, a pharaoh who reputedly had five queens. Since onlythe precessional max and min culminations need be demonstrated (there is littleneed to mark any intermediate point), thus the mysterious absence of Khafre’squeen’s pyramids is simply and logically explained.In conclusion, the two sets of Queen’s Pyramids at Giza demonstrate theprecessional minimum (setting) and maximum (rising) culminations of the Orion’sBelt stars, a process that takes some 13,000 years just to complete onehalf-cycle. That such astronomical information is exhibited to us in plain viewat Giza is truly extraordinary, and provides strong corroboration to the OrionGeo-Stellar Fingerprint, which—as we have seen—defines the base dimensions ofthe three main pyramids at Giza. So, in three distinct sets of structures atGiza, the constellation of Orion is clearly and unequivocally implicated, thusproviding corroboration to the Orion Geo-Stellar Fingerprint.Yet the Orion-Giza story isn’t quite over yet—there’s more.One of the main points of contention that opponents of the Orion-Giza hypothesisleveled at Bauval’s work was the fact that the Belt stars do not present aperfect, center-to-center correlation with the three Giza pyramid centers. Theerror, however, is very small and, indeed, it would seem that this minor errorwas quite intentional. We can deduce this from the fact that the Giza pyramidsmatch the Orion Geo-Stellar Fingerprint so accurately. Such an accurate matchcould only have been created from having made a near perfect observation andrecording of the belt star asterism.Furthermore, when we place the Belt stars over the pyramid centers, we find thatthe center star (Alnilam) is slightly offset from its pyramid center. However,when we circumscribe the pyramids precisely within a tight circle using thethree most extreme pyramid corners to define the circle’s circumference, we findthat the center of this Great Giza Circle (GGC) lies almost perfectly on thecenter of Alnilam.It seems, then, that the ancient designers of Giza measured and placed the beltstar asterism with high accuracy on the ground at Giza, but for some reasondecided to place Khafre’s Pyramid slightly offset from the Alnilam/GGC center.Intriguingly, independent researchers Scott Sacharczyk and Rob Miller have foundthat the offset between Khafre center and the center of the Great Giza Circlemeasures precisely 44 by 14 cubits, which represents an approximation of pi:44/14 (or reduced to 22/7) = 3.14285714, thus presenting the possibility thatthe G2 offset was deliberately created to encode the pi formula and, byextension, the Great Giza Circle.Khafre’s Pyramid has two entrances, a unique feature that scholars such asMiroslav Verner, Amelia Edwards (1831–1892), Ahmed Fakhry (1905–1973), and VitoMaragioglio and Celeste Rinaldi (per their 1963–1975 study) have regarded asperhaps indicating that the location of Khafre’s Pyramid was changed from anearlier planned location, which would have placed it slightly further north andeast of where it presently stands. This view agrees with the findings of theOrion Geo-Stellar Fingerprint and the center of the Great Giza Circle.To summarize, through the arrangement and dimensions of the various structuresat Giza we are presented with multiple pieces of quite diverse evidence, allpointing to a clear connection of the Giza pyramids with the Belt stars of theOrion constellation. With this mathematical and astronomical evidence—togetherwith the mass of cultural evidence previously cited by Bauval, Gilbert, andHancock supporting such a correlation—for Egyptologists to continue to rejectthat such an association was fully intended by the ancient designers must surelynow be considered an untenable position.A sufficient body of evidence now exists to allow us to safely conclude that thestructures at Giza were constructed with reference to a master plan. Theevidence presented here in support of this view may not conclusively prove anOrion-Giza association, but it is probably fair to say that if it is weight ofevidence that counts, then we must consider that the Orion-Giza association nowhas sufficient evidence to allow us to consider the hypothesis as proven beyondreasonable doubt.THE GIZA “CLOCK OF AGES”In acceptance of the Orion association with the Giza pyramids, what remains nowis to consider the “why” question: Why did the ancient designers expend so muchblood, sweat, and tears to create this great astronomical clock, indicating thepast date of circa 10,500 BCE and the future date of circa 2500 CE? Why are theancient designers indicating this 13,000-year half-cycle of time in a series ofmonuments that could easily have been built to survive such a lengthy period oftime—and more? And is it perhaps significant that around 10,500 BCE—the firstdate indicated in the astronomical clock—the last ice age came to an abrupt andsomewhat dramatic end with all manner of animal and plant species becomingextinct at that time? What event could have occurred on the Earth to bring aboutsuch dire global consequences?Whatever inspired the design and later construction of this quite monumentalastronomical “Clock of Ages” at Giza, it seems evidently clear that it must havebeen of vital importance. The two sets of Queen’s Pyramids at Giza present theBelt stars of Orion aligned in two different ways, indicating two differentdates: a horizontal alignment (minimum culmination indicating circa 10,500 BCE)and a perpendicular alignment (maximum culmination indicating circa 2500 CE).Our civilization ignores the dates indicated to us with these twoalignments—these Orion “signs”—at our peril."},{"pageContent":"N I N ETHE CYGNUS MYSTERYHAVE COSMIC RAYS AFFECTED HUMAN EVOLUTION?ANDREW COLLINSDid cosmic rays have a hand in effecting shifts in human evolution, fromPaleolithic times through to the modern day?

These arewild notions, yet they are suddenly beginning to appeal to mainstream scientistsand astronomers.

Muller (1890–1967) discoveredthat radiation (he used X-rays and later radium) was a mutagen through his workwith Drosophila fruit flies, the subject of whether or not high-energy cosmicrays might cause changes in human DNA was voiced for the first time. Mullerhimself twice wrote about the subject, concluding on each occasion that thenormal background fluctuation in cosmic rays reaching Earth was inadequate toexplain spontaneous mutations in life forms, whatever their type. Muller was notwrong. Yet had he been privy to modern scientific data, which now confirms thatat certain times in the Earth’s history the solar system has been bombarded withhigh levels of cosmic rays, he might have thought again.RECORDS FROM THE ICEWhen so-called primary cosmic rays hit the upper atmosphere, almost all of thembreak up when they collide with nuclei of oxygen and nitrogen, the processproducing a plethora of charged secondary particles. Many disintegrate inmilliseconds, but others form isotopes that are preserved in everything fromlake sediments to stalagmites and, more crucially, the layers of ice thataccumulate each year to great depth in the Arctic and Antarctic regions.One such isotope is Beryllium-10 (Be-10), which can be extracted from ice coresand measured to provide an accurate indication of cosmic ray activity in theupper atmosphere. It shows that over the past 100,000 years, there have beenthree periods when the cosmic ray flux has increased dramatically. The first wasaround circa 60,000 to 70,000 years ago, the second occurred approximately circa35,000 to 40,000 years ago, and the third and last peak began around 16,000 to17,000 years ago, and continued until around 14,000 years ago. Each spike lastedfor a period of approximately 2,000 years. Similar results have been determinedfrom a stalagmite removed from a submerged blue hole in the Bahamas. Anexamination of its Beryllium-10 content indicates that at various points between45,000 and 11,000 years ago, the Earth was bombarded by twice the amount ofcosmic radiation that we get today.WHERE’S THE COSMIC SOURCE?The first question we must ask is where this influx of cosmic radiation mighthave come from. Was it really a neutron star, as Carl Sagan suggested, or couldit have been another astronomical source out there in deep space? Alternatively,was there some other, more prosaic solution to this enigma? The more or lessregular gaps between the spikes of Beryllium-10 activity noted in the ice coresmight well indicate some kind of cyclic force in action, most obviously that ofthe sun. Cosmic rays are known to be partially deflected by the solar magneticfield that stretches far out into the heart of the solar system, making the rateof Beryllium-10 production in the upper atmosphere dependent on the strength ofthe solar field, which is itself connected with sunspot activity.In addition to this, the sun’s long-term climate cycles of 100,000, 41,000, and23,000 years, first noted by Serbian geophysicist Milutin Milanković(1879–1958), must also affect the production of Beryllium-10 for similarreasons, such as the influence of the solar field upon the Earth’s upperatmosphere. This said, there might easily have been other factors behind thesudden increase in cosmic rays hitting the Earth, the most catastrophic being asupernova, the death of a star as it expels the last of its nuclear fuel andcollapses to form a high-mass compact object, most usually a white dwarf, blackhole, or neutron star.Supernovas are thought to produce enormous bursts of cosmic rays and gamma rays,which are sent careening across space at virtually the speed of light. If suchan event occurred close enough to our own solar system, then the Earth would beshowered by deadly radiation. This would damage the ozone layer, causing notonly many more rays to reach the surface of the planet, but also the onset ofhigh levels of UV radiation from the sun. More conservatively, catastrophistssuggest that cosmic rays from a close supernova would dramatically increasecloud formation, preventing the sun from penetrating through the atmosphere,thus bringing about a sudden ice age.Whatever the consequences of a close supernova, life on Earth would suffer massextinctions. As terrifying a scenario as this might seem, it was the favoredtheory for the sudden disappearance of the dinosaurs some 65 million years agountil the discovery in 1980 of the Chicxulub impact crater in Mexico’s Yucatanpeninsula. This helped confirm the alternative theory that a super-sizedasteroid or comet had been responsible for their extinction. Indeed, thesupernova solution had been the choice of Carl Sagan and his coauthor Dr. I. S.Shklovskii, the famous Soviet astrophysicist and radio astronomer, in a bookentitled Intelligence in the Universe, published in 1966. In fact, one wonderswhether Sagan’s unique view that cosmic rays have accelerated human evolutionactually stemmed from his obvious fascination with the extinction of thedinosaurs.Yet the powerful idea of a close supernova wreaking devastation on Earth duringsome past geological age lingers, with some catastrophists believing that itcould have brought about mass extinctions during other geological epochs, forinstance at the close of the Jurassic Age some 145 million years ago, as well asat the culmination of the Pleistocene Age, which coincided with the end of thelast ice age some 12,000 years ago. And such scientific speculation is where itstarts getting interesting, for when the high levels of Beryllium-10 were firstnoted in the ice cores at the beginning of the 1990s, scientists from the CosmicRay Council of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, working alongside a team from theUniversity of Arizona, speculated that those around 35–40,000 years ago probablyresulted from a supernova explosion.To back up their dramatic claims, the joint Soviet-American team cited thepresence of an immense formation of glowing clouds of gaseous debris—theremnants of an unimaginable supernova explosion around 150 light-years away(that’s just 900 million, million miles from here) in the northern constellationof Cygnus. Had this remnant of a supernova explosion—known to astronomers as theCygnus Veil, or Veil Nebula—been responsible for showering the Earth with cosmicrays for anything up to 2,000 years some 35,000 to 40,000 years ago? Did itbring about dramatic climatic changes and bursts of radiation that evolvedhumanity into what we are today?THE EMERGENCE OF MANFor whatever reason, the worldwide press coverage that resulted from thisdramatic announcement of a close supernova decimating the Earth some 35,000years ago came to nothing. Yet, thankfully, there was one person who did takenotice—British anthropological writer Denis Montgomery. Having lived in Africafor many years, where anatomically modern humans emerged for the first timearound 200,000 years ago, he became intrigued as to why sudden jumps inevolution occur. Was it purely spontaneous, through chemical changes in thebody, or were there other exterior factors at play, such as environmental andclimatic changes, nutritional variety, interbreeding, or even simplecompetitiveness?Although there is ample evidence that our earliest ancestors migrated fromAfrica, most probably in search of new food resources, as early as 70,000 to80,000 years ago, only tiny glimpses exist of what we were capable of achievingat this time. For instance, around 80,000 years ago, the peoples of the Republicof the Congo were making barbed bone hooks for fishing, while a community thatinhabited a large cave at a place called Blombos on the southern coast of SouthAfrica would seem to have fashioned the earliest known examples of expressiveart.These take the form of incised pieces of red ochre, showing recurringcross-hatch designs, as well as perforated snail shell beads, once strung on acord and worn either as a necklace or a bracelet. All of these invaluableobjects are thought to be approximately 75,000 years old. Then there is therecently discovered archaeological evidence from a remote mountain cave inBotswana sacred to the indigenous San bushmen. This shows that ritual activityhas been occurring here in a similar manner for anything up to 70,000 years,around the time when the first migrations out of Africa are thought to haveoccurred. Strangely, this was also when the ice core samples tell us that therewas a dramatic increase in cosmic radiation hitting the Earth, the first ofthree major bursts in the past 100,000 years.AGE OF THE ARTISTYet aside from this clear evidence of human creativity and imagination 70,000 to80,000 years ago, it was not until the start of the Upper Paleolithic Age around40,000 years ago that something quite dramatic started to take place. At a timecoincident to when Homo sapiens first entered a Europe dominated by hisNeanderthal cousins, there is clear evidence for the sudden emergence of acomplex life style, the earliest known to humankind. It involved religiousexpression and practices, including detailed funerary rites, as well asmagnificent new forms of art, such as the carving of animals, birds, and humansin bone and stone. It also involved, crucially, the manifestation of highlysophisticated cave art, such as the extraordinary painted galleries discoveredas recently as 1994 at Chauvet in France’s Ardèche region.Occupied as early as 30,000 to 32,000 years ago, it contains images andsculptures of whole menageries of wild animals, including horses, rhinos, lions,mammoths, and bison. Alongside these are perhaps the oldest knownrepresentations of the human form anywhere in the world. These are representedby painted torsos and legs of a large-bodied woman, typical of later “Venuses”found either in statue form or as high relief in other caves, and anaccompanying bison-headed figure labeled the Sorcerer, both of which are to beseen in the deepest part of the cave system.Rapidly, hundreds of caves across western Europe became full of accomplished artforms, a tradition which lingered until approximately 17,000 years ago, when arenewed interest in sacred painting deep underground suddenly developed. Thistrend finally ended around 12,000 years ago when the Upper Paleolithic Ageclimaxed coincident to the cessation of the last ice age.What Denis Montgomery wondered was whether, in addition to other environmental,climatic, and human factors, the increase in cosmic rays approximately 35,000years ago (perhaps from the assumed supernova explosion which caused thecreation of the Cygnus Veil) acted as a mutagen to effect sudden changes in thebrain’s neurological processes. This, in turn, might have brought about theenlightened age of the cave artist in western Europe. It could also explain whythe Neanderthal peoples suddenly became extinct around this time, perhaps as aresult of too much competition from their competitive new neighbors, the Homosapiens.Montgomery’s unique ideas were privately published, and, inevitably, largelyignored by the scholarly community. Adding to his problems was the realizationby astronomers during the mid-1990s that the Cygnus Veil, the nebula at thecenter of what Montgomery came to call the “Cygnus event,” was found to be not150 light-years away from Earth, as had previously been thought, but muchfurther away, probably around 1,800 light-years’ distance from here. At thisgreater distance, any supernova would have been little more than a bright lightsource in the northern sky, lasting for a period of several days beforegradually dying away.Doubly damning were recalculations concerning the age of the supernova event,which now appears to have occurred as recently as 5,000 to 8,000 years ago (eventhough some astronomers still reckon it took place much earlier, perhaps 10,000to 15,000 years ago). Thus there was no way that the Cygnus Veil could have beenresponsible for the high levels of cosmic rays reaching Earth’s atmosphere priorto the emergence of the first European cave artists some 32,000 years ago. Sowhere did they come from?ENTER THE MEINEL GROUPIt would not be until 2005 that this same cosmological conundrum would again betackled, this time by an academic think tank from Nevada. At the conference ofthe Theoretical Archeological Group (TAG) in Sheffield, England, held inDecember of that year, Dr. Aden Meinel—professor emeritus of the College ofOptical Sciences at the University of Arizona and distinguished veteran ofNASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who in the 1980s was responsible for thelaunch of space telescopes such as the Hubble—told a packed audience ofarchaeologists and students that the high levels of Beryllium-10 in theGreenland and Antarctica ice cores indicated that cosmic rays were responsiblefor germ-line mutations in both animals and human life around 35,000 to 40,000years ago. This, he reported, had been the reason for the emergence ofCro-Magnon man in western Europe, and the sudden disappearance of theNeanderthals at the same time.In addition to this, Meinel revealed that he and his colleagues had been able touse the ice core evidence to determine the approximate astronomical coordinatesfor the source of the cosmic rays. They had pinpointed an area of the sky in thenorthern hemisphere, coincident to the constellation of Draco. Here theysearched for a possible source of cosmic rays and settled on a planetary nebula(a mass of glowing gas and cloud) known as the Cat’s Eye. This, Meinel’s groupproposed, was the remnants of a galactic binary system consisting of a supergiant and a once-active black hole that had spewed out jets of plasma,superheated ionized gas, along its line of axis at close to the speed of light.These, he said, had penetrated thousands of light-years of space to reach theEarth around 35,000 to 40,000 years ago, causing the changes in evolutionwitnessed at this time.It was a bold theory. Unfortunately, astrophysicists are unanimous in theiropinion that the Cat’s Eye nebula does not contain (and never has contained) ablack hole able to produce cosmic rays that might reach the solar system.However, the Meinel group are sticking to their guns, and remain convinced thatthe Cat’s Eye nebula is the source of the cosmic rays that they believe affectedhuman evolution in Paleolithic times. Yet tellingly, before being beguiled bythe beauty of the Cat’s Eye nebula, the Meinel group had originally determinedthe direction of the cosmic ray activity detected in the ice core samples ascoming not from Draco, but from neighboring Cygnus, the constellation of theswan. So had they got it wrong? Were the cosmic rays coming, as Denis Montgomeryhad surmised, from somewhere in Cygnus after all?THE OLDEST CONSTELLATIONThis is where I enter the frame. My own independent research into the emergenceof primitive societies, with their unique cosmologies and religion, had revealedan inordinate interest in one particular constellation—Cygnus, the celestialbird or swan, better known today as the Northern Cross. Indeed, it features asone of the oldest known artistic representations of a constellation anywhere inthe world, for it is seen on the walls of the famous Lascaux cave in southernFrance, which is known to have first been occupied around 17,000 years ago. Hereit appears in a fresco found in the cave’s deepest part, known as the wellshaft, as a bird-man falling into a trance next to a charging bison and a birdon a pole. This is likely meant to represent the so-called sky-pole of theshaman used universally to enter the sky-world via a cosmic axis, located in thevicinity of the north celestial pole, or Pole Star. From around 16,000 to 13,000BCE, this was located amid the stars of Cygnus, which even by this time wouldappear to have been seen as a sky-bird of some sort.[../Images/image_3.jpg]Fig. 9.1. The well scene in the cave of Lascaux in France’s Dordogne region.Located in the deepest part of the caves, the fresco dates from around 15,000BCE and seems to show Cygnus as a bird on a pole and a bird-man falling into atrance. Image provided courtesy of Andrew Collins.Cygnus was also very likely the inspiration behind the appearance of the Venusand Sorcerer fresco in France’s Chauvet Cave, where the woman’s legs and thighsmight well signify an abstract representation of the region of the Milky Wayknown as the Dark Rift, which opens out in the Cygnus region. Throughout theages this region of the sky, close to where the ecliptic, the path of the sun,crosses the Milky Way, has been viewed as the vulva and womb of a sky-goddess,or Cosmic Mother, who gives birth to the sun. Sometimes the Cygnus stars areeven seen to be attached to the Earth via a kind of invisible umbilical cord,showing it as a nourisher of life.Cygnus also appears as a bird in Church Hole cave in Derbyshire’s Creswell Cragsalongside cave art dated to 12,800 years ago. A 12,000-year-old stone temple—theoldest anywhere in the world—at Göbekli Tepe in southeast Turkey seems alignedto this same constellation. It is the same story with ancient stone and earthenstructures worldwide—from the bird effigy mounds of North America to the Olmeccenters of Mexico, the Incan sacred city of Cuzco, the Egyptian Pyramids ofGiza, the Hindu temples of India, to the Irish and British megalithic stonecomplexes of Newgrange and Avebury—all of which seem to reflect an age-oldinterest in Cygnus.[../Images/image_4.jpg]Fig. 9.2. The Pre-pottery Neolithic cult centre of Göbekli Tepe near Urfa insoutheast Turkey, constructed around 12,000 years ago. Did its shamanic eliteinherit ideas relating to flashes of light caused by cosmic rays from thePaleolithic cave artists of Western Europe?

Author’s collection.Putting aside more obvious astronomical reasons why our ancestors might havefavored this particular constellation in their religious beliefs and practices,I searched for other reasons why it was depicted deep underground by the caveartists of the Upper Paleolithic Age. In the knowledge that the work of SouthAfrican anthropologist and rock art specialist David Lewis-Williams haddetermined that much prehistoric cave art was inspired by shamans inmind-altered states, I wondered whether the stars of Cygnus had come to beassociated with religious experiences deep underground, where their most sacredcave art was executed.CHILDREN OF THE SWANI searched for answers and found that in the early to mid-1980s, undergroundparticle detectors in different parts of the world began detecting incomingcosmic rays from deep space. Since they came in cycles of exactly 4.79 hours,the source was easily determined, for this same cycle had already been recordedin connection with other forms of electromagnetic radiation inbound from anobject called Cygnus X-3, located some 37,000 light-years away in the heart ofthe Cygnus constellation. So inexplicable were these peculiar, neutrallycharged, strongly interacting particles, resonating at some of the highestenergies ever detected, that they were quickly dubbed “cygnons,” later changedto “cygnets,” meaning “children of the swan.” This amazing data led tocontroversial claims that Cygnus X-3 was the first identified cosmic particleaccelerator in the galaxy.Cygnus X-3 is a binary system composed of a dying Wolf-Rayet star that feeds aclose proximity neutron star (or, some suggest, a black hole or strange quarkstar) producing streams of superheated plasma (ionized gas). This ejecta is shotout at relativistic speeds, very close to the speed of light, along its line ofaxis, causing jets of debris that reach out into the local stellar medium fortens of light-years of distance. These unimaginable beams, like cosmicsearchlights, are held together by magnetic sheaths that produce powerfulparticle acceleration in a variety of frequency ranges, including X-rays,infrared, radio waves, and gamma rays. This is not uncommon in so-called compactstars, like black holes or neutron stars, but in 2000, astrophysicists announcedthat Cygnus X-3 might well be the galaxy’s first blazar, a term used when one ofa deep space object’s twin plasma jets is aligned toward our solar system (inother words, it is pointing straight at us). Other blazars have been identifiedoutside of the galaxy, but this is the first time that one has been suspected toexist in our own backyard, so to speak.[../Images/image_6.jpg]Fig. 9.4. Cygnus X-3 as photographed by the Chandra X-ray platform in 2000. Isthis the source of cosmic rays influencing life on Earth? Image providedcourtesy of NASA/SRON/MPE.What this means is that we are looking straight down the barrel of the mostdangerous cosmic cannon in the galaxy, and have been, according toastrophysicists, for anything up to 700,000 years. The significance of this isthat the ejecta produced by such jets could easily be responsible for increasedlevels of cosmic rays reaching the Earth. This includes Cygnus X-3’s uniquecygnet particles that, being neutrally charged, reach the Earth directly fromsource, and are able to penetrate deep underground, which is something thatcosmic rays are usually unable to do, since they are positively charged andbreak up before they reach the surface of the planet (neutrinos, which arenegatively charged cosmic particles with almost no mass, pass through the Earthall the time without affecting anything). More important, recent findings byJapanese and Chinese scientists using data from a facility in Tibet have shownthat there is, even today, a huge excess of high energy cosmic rays coming froma point in the Cygnus constellation close to the astronomical coordinates ofCygnus X-3.[../Images/image_7.jpg]Fig. 9.5.

Notice therelativistic jet spewing out superheated plasma at close to the speed of light.Is one of Cygnus X-3’s relativistic jets aimed straight at the Earth? Imageprovided courtesy of NASA and The Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/ AURA).SEEING THE LIGHTThis staggering scenario might well explain why our ancestors came to recognizethe celestial swan as so important to their religious mind-set, since there isevery reason to conclude that ancient shamans who achieved altered states ofconsciousness in deep cave settings, most obviously using hallucinogens, somehowbecame aware of the effect Cygnus was having on their lives. This might seemimpossible. However, there is every chance that they would have been able to seethe disintegration underground of cygnet particles, through a process known asCherenkov radiation, which allows decaying cosmic rays to be seen as ghostlyflashes of white or blue-white light as they pass through the aqueous part ofthe eye.Astronauts first discovered this phenomenon in 1968 when they were aboard theApollo 11 spacecraft. As they tried to get off to sleep, they reported seeing“flashes and streaks” before their eyes (scientifically known as “phosphenes”).This occurred with their eyes open or closed, something that recurred duringfuture space missions, prompting a series of onboard experiments that provedthat they were being caused by cosmic rays passing through the hull of the spacevessel.LIKE LOOKING INTO THE UNIVERSEHungarian-born Cornelius A. Tobias (1918–2000), a founding member of LawrenceBerkeley National Laboratory’s Donner Laboratory and an expert on space biology,had earlier predicted the level of cosmic radiation that future astronauts wouldbe exposed to, and even described its potential effects. More significantly, hepredicted that they would also see flashes of light before their eyes. To testhis hypothesis, he devised a unique, but very dangerous, experiment. He decidedto expose himself to subatomic particles produced by UC Berkeley’s Bevalacparticle accelerator, which has been described as a veritable cosmic rayfactory.Part of its function is to rip away electrons from heavy elements includingiron, and then focus the nuclei into a beam of particles, which are thenaccelerated to virtually the speed of light, like the relativistic jets producedby compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars. Tobias quite literallystuck his head in the flow of the particles and observed something almost uniqueon Earth. “You see visual flashes,” he recalled, shortly before his death in2000. “It is an exhilarating sensation. It is as though you are looking into theuniverse itself.” Tobias repeated the experiment, even introducing hiscolleagues to the experience, until the tests were finally discontinued onhealth grounds.Although it is suspected that these subatomic particles pass through the aqueouspart of the eye, more recent research by Livio Narici of the National Institutefor Nuclear Physics in Rome has suggested that some cosmic rays might hit thebrain directly, causing not only the sensation of light flashes but also otherseemingly external effects such as odd smells. Narici believes that phosphenescan be created when the particles hit the visual cortex, along with theolfactory bulb (causing smells) and possibly even the central nervous system. Ifso, then they could pose a potential health hazard to astronauts on future spacemissions, especially if phosphenes, or indeed other forms of sensory phenomena,occur at crucial moments such as when maneuvering vehicles to land. Narici hasnow been granted permission to conduct experiments with astronauts onboard theInternational Space Station (ISS) under the project name of ALTEA.A helmet-shaped multisensor device will be worn by volunteers for an hour at atime to monitor the passage of incoming cosmic rays. At the same time, theastronauts will log when they see light flashes or trails. Hopefully, the twowill coincide, telling Narici and his team where exactly the particles arehitting.Under normal circumstances, we do not see cosmic rays down here on Earth, sincewe rarely experience total darkness. Moreover, the vast majority of cosmic rayshitting the Earth are broken up in the upper atmosphere, and fall as showers ofharmless secondary particles. Even if we were to experience total darkness atground level, so many other forms of environmental radiation, whether natural orindustrially produced, might additionally cause phosphenes, meaning that anyproduced specifically by incoming cosmic rays would be lost in the process.Virtually all forms of environmental radiation are shielded out deepunderground. This is the reason why particle detectors and accelerators arelocated deep underground in mines, or off the side of tunnels inside mountains.Only here can they be sheltered from extraneous radiation, including straycosmic rays penetrating the overhead rock. This, then, is what makes the cygnetsfrom Cygnus X-3 so unique. Only strong, neutral particles of this kind are ableto penetrate depths of hundreds of feet, before finally breaking up to causesecondary particles known as muons. It is for this reason alone that they werefirst detected by underground facilities, which at the time were attempting towitness the decay of a subatomic particle known as the proton. They included theSoudan underground mine facility in Minnesota and the NUSEX experiment in theMont Blanc facility in southern France.[../Images/image_9.jpg]Fig. 9.7. A micrograph showing a cosmic ray impact. Image provided courtesy ofAndrew Collins.Thus a shaman in the total darkness of a deep cave setting would be troubledonly by incoming cosmic rays from just a very few deep space sources, the mostlikely being Cygnus X-3 (although some facilities have detected a weaker cosmicparticle inbound from a source designated Hercules X-1). Intriguingly, I havespoken to a woman whose father worked in the Soudan underground mine before theparticle detection facility was built at the beginning of the 1980s. She claimsthat he would experience unaccountable flashes of light in the total darkness. Ihave heard similar stories from those who have spent long periods inside deepcaves and mines in Britain, including the Cheddar Caves in southern England andan abandoned slate mine beneath a mountain at Dinas, West Wales. All reportunaccountable flashes of light in such environments. Even though geologicallyproduced radiation, such as radon gas, might account for the production of somephosphenes underground, there is every chance that some are the result ofincoming cosmic rays.CLOSER TO GODIs this, then, what our Paleolithic ancestors also experienced deepunderground—flashes of light caused by the passage of cosmic rays inbound fromsources such as Cygnus X-3? Would they have interpreted such experiences in areligious context? I think the answer is going to be yes. On the isolatedpeninsular of Mount Athos in southern Greece, ascetic monks adhering to a formof religious devotion known as hesychasm, also called omphaloscopy, or“navel-gazing,” have for centuries repaired to the darkness of caves on themountain to witness the divine light and glory of God, which is compared withthat experienced by the disciples on Mount Tabor at the time of theTransfiguration of Jesus. It is a process that involves a period of deepmeditation and contemplation that can last for several days, perhaps evenlonger. Yet eventually, I have been told firsthand, they witness flashes oflight, which are interpreted as the Light of God. When this occurs it is oftenaccompanied by visions of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and the Christian saints—thewhole process is said to bring them closer to God.No one knows the origins of hesychasm, although it is thought to have beenintroduced to Mount Athos, its principal center, from Cappadocia in easternTurkey, the home of the earliest Christian Fathers, and some of the most austereChristian ascetics. Such religious practices most probably came originally fromshamanically based notions that had their genesis among the earliest Neolithiccommunities of central and eastern Turkey, including the city of Çatal Hüyüknear Konya and, before that, the Pre-Pottery Neolithic cult centers of GöbekliTepe, circa 10,000 BCE, and Nevali Cori, circa 8400 BCE.Although apparently unconnected to the term omphaloscopy (which is a derisoryterm), it should be pointed out that the navel (the Greek omphalos) is a primarysymbol of the axis mundi, the axis of the Earth, thought to be linked via aninvisible sky-pole or umbilical cord to a cosmic axis located in the vicinity ofthe North Star. Curiously, the name Göbekli Tepe means in Turkish the “hill ofthe navel,” suggesting that it was once thought to be an axis mundi in its ownright.FEELS LIKE HEAVENI believe it highly probable that the mental discipline of “seeing the light,”or in other words, witnessing flashes of light in deep cave settings, issomething that was first experienced by Paleolithic shamans, in Europeespecially. It was then inherited by the shamanic elite responsible for theconstruction of subsurface cult centers built by the earliest Neolithic peoples.The idea of spending time in the darkness of cavelike environments was, Isuspect, a key element in their beliefs and practices. Such ideas brought withthem the vision of a communion with otherworldly influences that, as spacebiology expert Cornelius Tobias commented in connection with his own experiencesof seeing the light, made you feel like “looking into the universe itself.”What we also know is that flashes of light produced in deep cave settings bycosmic rays coming from Cygnus X-3 will have increased and decreased inaccordance with the presence overhead of the Cygnus stars, enabling thePaleolithic shamans to eventually synchronize their chthonic beliefs andpractices with its cosmic ray cycle, and thus identify this astronomical regionas the source of origin of their visionary experiences.Moreover, the appearance of seemingly objective flashes in the eyes mightadditionally have been taken, as is the case of the hesychasts of Mount Athos,as manifestations of some kind of primal cause, triggering more complexconnections with what might have been conceived of as a divine being. Thisscenario might well have led our ancestors to learn what science is confirmingtoday—that life came from the stars. Indeed, the theory of panspermia, literally“life everywhere,” proposes that the most primitive forms of life probablyarrived on this planet having hitched a ride either on a comet, meteor, orasteroid. In many ways, it is the origin of the belief that we come from heaven,and will return there in death.In Europe, it was the swan that was said to carry the souls of the dead into thenext world, which was located in the north, the direction in which swansmigrated to their breeding grounds each spring. In the Baltic region it was theswan that took the place of the stork in bringing babies into the world. It isvery likely, for these reasons, that the stars of Cygnus, an ever-presentnorthern constellation, became associated with migratory birds such as the swan.However, in regions where the swan was absent, other avians took its place.For instance, it is clear that in the Near East, the bird of Cygnus wasoriginally the vulture, which in early Neolithic practices at places such asÇatal Hüyük was involved in the excarnation process of denuding bodies and then,as a psychopomp (the Greek word for “soul carrier”), accompanied the soul of thedeceased into the afterlife.COSMIC MOTHERIn my opinion, this communion with the great unknown in deep cave settings ledthe ancients to celebrate the idea that we are star-stuff by teaching that thesun was periodically reborn from between the thighs of the Cosmic Mother,symbolized by the Milky Way’s Great Rift which begins in the Cygnusconstellation (something that might indeed be depicted in the PaleolithicChauvet Cave in southern France). Moreover, I feel sure that at least aproportion of the cosmic rays that arguably caused mutagenic changes in DNAduring Paleolithic times came from the direction of Cygnus, the locationsearched originally by both anthropological writer Denis Montgomery and ex-NASAscientist and astronomer Aden Meinel for a source of cosmic rays hitting theEarth.Such an intrusion into human consciousness from a deep space object in theCygnus region might well explain why the cosmic bird has been at the heart ofreligious beliefs and practices since Paleolithic times. Worldwide, there is atradition concerning a sky-bird that either lays a cosmic egg that then becomesthe universe, or gives forth a honk, or call, that brings the universe intomanifestation. It is present in India, Egypt, and even in the Pacific SouthSeas, and in each instance the bird is said to be represented by the stars ofCygnus.When in 1973 Carl Sagan wrote that cosmic rays were responsible for changes inhuman evolution, he boldly asserted that their source was most probably adistant neutron star. Today there can be little doubt that the neutron star inquestion is Cygnus X-3—the galaxy’s first blazar, as well as the best candidateby far for at least a proportion of the cosmic radiation responsible for theacceleration of human evolution at a time when we were just beginning to emergeas modern human beings. Yet more disturbing is the fact that Cygnus X-3 is outthere now, its cosmic gun barrel trained toward the solar system, ever ready torelease volleys of cosmic debris and other types of electromagnetic radiation inour direction. Astrophysicists studying Cygnus X-3 are waiting for what theydescribe as the “next big bang”—showers of cosmic particles on a level neverseen before, and when this happens, who knows, it might well signal thecommencement of the next upgrade in human evolution."},{"pageContent":"T E NELECTROMAGNETISM AND THE ANCIENTSDID ANCIENT HUMANS HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM?GLENN KREISBERGIt’s been suggested, at various times, that ancient humans had knowledge and useof unseen powers, forces, and energy fields. Could these unseen forces andfields consist of electromagnetic frequency waves and particle fields that makeup the electromagnetic spectrum? This is not a simple question to answer.What evidence exists, and what kind of evidence may come to light, to supportsuch a claim? There is no question that, as it has always existed, theelectromagnetic spectrum is a naturally occurring part of our environment,comprised of a continuous sequence of electromagnetic energy arranged accordingto wavelength or frequency, as generated by particle motion (vibrations) andpulses created from many sources. There is also no doubt that many ancientcultures had a connection with nature and natural forces that was fundamentaland could only be described as intimate and profound in ways we moderns canmerely attempt to comprehend.This article will examine some of what evidence (and possible evidence) existsthat suggests ancient knowledge of the electromagnetic spectrum, examine itsscientific foundation and whether it can be used to form a hypothesis and,hopefully, be applied to solving this mystery.From ancient times to today, humans have demonstrated an inherent curiosity andthe desire to understand mysterious and odd phenomena, signs, and images. Forthe vanished cultures of Egypt, Sumer, and other early civilizations, andactually for the entire lapsed time of humankind, there remain many unsolved andunsettled images, messages, texts, tablets, artifacts, inscriptions, engravings,schemes, and phenomena that suggest a connection to unseen forces.As modern society explores the mysterious meanings of certain universal culturalmyths and symbols, so, too, may have humans from earlier civilizations, whorepeated and venerated various motifs throughout time and traditions. The originand meaning of these mysterious symbols may, in fact, have remained unknown evento the ancient cultures that utilized them, the ancients knowing only thatcertain signs and symbols were important clues to even more ancient lostknowledge and powers.It has been noted by many that the designs and motifs of ancient architectureoften reflect—and in many ways try to mimic—the patterns, signs, and signalsfound to occur naturally in our environment. Most significant, for the purposesof this report, are the many variations of the basic waveforms, be it sine wave,sawtooth wave, box wave, or the endless variety of spirals and waveforms thatadorn ancient cave walls, temples, and structures, and that appear inarchitecture, scrolls, tablets, and inscriptions throughout the ancient world.Southeastern Native American cultures dating back 20,000 to 25,000 yearsextensively used waveform symbols for ornamentation on nearly all handmade itemsand wares, such as pottery and textiles. The variety is nearly endless. As Ihave mentioned, the electromagnetic spectrum exists naturally, occurring as apart of our natural environment. And again, acknowledging the ancients’ intimacyand interdependency with nature, it would not be surprising if they possessedsome knowledge of this naturally occurring “tool.”The ancient cultures of this world are known to have identified and utilized theforces of nature to their benefit, including water, fire, wind, and sound. Arewe to believe that mankind is only now, in the past century, exploiting thewaves and frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum for the first time? I’mnot so sure. And perhaps more important, if ancient cultures did possess thisknowledge, where did it come from, and how was it processed?A thorough examination of this subject must begin with tracking thebreakthroughs and discoveries that have occurred throughout history and thathave led to the concepts and principles that make up modern electromagnetictheory.[../Images/image_10.jpg]Fig. 10.1. Mayan Pyramid of Kukulkan at Chichén Itzá has a sawtooth waveformbuilt into its architecture. Photograph courtesy of SacredSites.com.Electromagnetic radiation has been around since the birth of the universe; lightis its most familiar form. Electric and magnetic fields are part of the spectrumof electromagnetic radiation, which extends from static electric and magneticfields, through radio frequency and infrared radiation, to X-rays.From written history it appears that many of the concepts now familiar inelectromagnetic theory were explored and developed during a time when manymodern high-tech investigative and detection tools and methods did not exist.But is it possible that the ability to manipulate the particles and waves of theelectromagnetic spectrum was discovered and developed even earlier than writtenhistory suggests? Could it be that many of the symbols, images, architectures,and myths of ancient cultures are representations reflecting the possession ofsuch knowledge?Observing what he believes to be power plant plans on ancient tapestry, andmicroprocessor design in Egyptian temple layout, Slovakian researcher Dr. PavelSmutny has written, “Maybe it is unusual and surprising, but in ornaments on oldcarpets are woven-in schemes, and principle plans of advanced technologies,which come from vanished cultures and thousands-year-old civilizations. Theseresidues are probably the last ones which can help revive forgotten, verysophisticated technologies and methods for exploitation of natural electrostaticenergy sources.”*5 [../Text/ch21.html#anchor_1982_0]On the Egyptian temples, Smutny continues, “If we see plans for the Valleytemple at [the] Sphinx, or of the mortuary temple at Chaphre’s Pyramid, or themortuary temple at Menkaure Pyramid, or also of Osereion from Abydos, to aperson familiar with the basics of computer techniques, or even better to [a]person experienced with construction of microwave circuits in bands above onegigahertz (GHz), he will tell you that these plans are schemes of PCBs (boardsfor electronic circuits).”[../Images/image_11.jpg]Fig. 10.2. Photograph showing Neolithic “ lobe” construction of the Temple ofMnajdra on Malta. Photograph courtesy of SacredSites.com.Smutny further notes, “These plans look like schemes of electronic circuitsworking on quite high frequencies above 1 GHz, with use of so-called componentswith distributed (spread) parameters. These components are of such sort, thatthe top conductive layer is formed to various shapes, which work as inductors,capacitors, resistors, filters, resonators, or have similar functions.Advantages of so produced circuits are very good functions and low losses onhigh frequencies. Not so different from classical electronic circuits with useof discrete components as began to be produced in the 1980s, in at that timesuperior high frequency devices.”If, as Smutny suggests, these tapestry patterns and temple layouts arerepresentations of fragmentary remnants from long-lost science, what could havebeen the original source, other than a previously existing technologicallyadvanced civilization? Of course more evidence is needed before any solidconclusions can be drawn.Turning his attention to the ancient temples of Malta, Smutny explains,“complexes were used probably as generators of high frequency acoustic waves.Purposes were (maybe) to arrange a communication channel among variousislands.”*6 [../Text/ch21.html#anchor_1984_0]Legends abound in Malta of sirens (acoustically) tempting or deafeningseafarers. Sirens were persons, possibly the best singers with the strongestvoices, namely obese or thick women, such as some modern opera stars. Manystatues of just such women have been discovered everywhere on Malta, includingin temples, standing on pedestals, and in the middle of complexes. Smutnyspeculates, “their singing modulated low frequency signals, which were generatedon opposite ends of temples (in windows and in doors) simply with a bell, orwith vibrating metal plates, or even with a strong wind drafted through a wallopening.”To support his theory, Smutny points to the massive blocks used for constructionof the complexes, noting that they are a very good resonant material. Smutnysuggests a reconstruction experiment to prove functionality of the megalithiccomplexes, in which the roofs would be intact (buildings are currently withoutceilings), and models made from concrete, or from stone in suitable scale. Fortesting, acoustical or ultrasound frequencies should be utilized, wherewavelengths are diminished to scale.As a radio frequency engineer, I find these possibilities fascinating, and whilepondering them, I had a bit of a revelation: Namely, a bird’s-eye view of thetemple structure and configurations in Malta in many ways closely resembles anantenna propagation pattern, with its main beam lobe, side lobes, and nulls(between the lobes).[../Images/image_12.jpg]Fig. 10.3. The multichambered oval configuration of the Maltese temples allowedsignals formed from groups of air particles, before output, to be amplified in asecond parallel opposite oval spaces of the temple. This would be analogous witha resonator. Photograph courtesy of SacredSites.com.There are an infinite variety of patterns that can be generated by antennas,depending on the beam width desired, distance between the antenna poles, and thefrequency being transmitted. However, nearly all antenna patterns have similarcharacteristics, consisting of main beam lobe and side lobes, as well as nullsand back lobes.I believe lobe was a word Graham Hancock specifically used in his bookUnderworld: The Mysterious Origins of Civilization to describe the templestructures on Malta. When Hancock mentioned the unusual acoustics he encounteredin the Hypogeum on Malta, I began researching anything that referred to thoseacoustics or a similar effect.In Joseph S. Ellul’s 1988 publication Malta’s Prediluvian Culture at theStone-Age Temples, the author describes, “Before going into the entrance, justhave a look at the lintel and at the long blocks lying alongside and on top ofit. Most of them, including the lintel itself, which measures about nine feetsquare and eighteen inches thick, were scattered about in this courtyard. Almostall of these blocks had been thrown over into this yard for a distance of abouttwenty feet. The lintel fell on its right corner and was splintered in thefall.” Interestingly, Ellul continues, “That lintel was found resting somethirty feet to the east of the doorway, lying on some rubbish and with one ofthe long horizontal slabs on top of it. It happened that the upper stone hadcertain acoustic characteristics and was positioned so as to be almost perfectlybalanced, and whenever one hit it with another stone, it rang like a bell.” Thatpeculiarity earned it the nickname of “The Bell of a ar Qim” but, during workscarried out in the 1950s, these various blocks were put back in their presentplaces on top of the front wall, and “The Bell of a ar Qim” was no more.Odds are, of course, that this is all simply coincidence, but it poses theinteresting question: Exactly what is the unique and specific temple designlayout of a ar Qim based upon? What was the impetus and influence that dictatedthe architectural configuration so long ago?I design digital wireless networks utilizing the electromagnetic spectrum,transmitters, receivers, modulators, and antenna. I also do propagationprediction modeling using powerful computer programs. The program creates amodel showing how a location will perform using different antenna, elevation,azimuths, and power settings. Sites are chosen based on how well the locationpropagates a signal.Again, when Hancock mentions in Underworld how the land gently dropped away fora great distance from a temple location, I couldn’t help think how ideal that isfor signal propagation when designing sites that can transmit great distances.Is it possible that some ancient temple locations were chosen for similarreasons? If the temple location were part of some kind of communications networkutilizing the electromagnetic spectrum, I’d say they were.Is it possible that a correlation exists between the Maltese temple architectureand antenna propagation patterns? Perhaps, but much more research andinvestigation is needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn. Certainly itcan be said that the temple layout seems to conform strikingly to thecharacteristics of antenna propagation patterns.If a connection were proven to exist, what would be the implications? Certainly,a radical rethinking of the level of technological sophistication that may haveexisted in ancient civilization, not to mention the question of how thisknowledge came to the builders of the Maltese temples.Let’s assume, for a moment, that the ancient builders had knowledge andunderstanding of wave propagation. Perhaps early post-Flood cultures possessedthe knowledge and understood the purpose of unseen forces but lacked thefunctionality. If it was known and handed down through generations that auniversal force existed that could be controlled for the benefit of all humans,would not every effort be made, no matter how futile the attempt, to resurrectand re-create that functionality? This in itself could account for the existenceof many megalithic structures, about the many aspects and purpose of whichhumankind has puzzled over since their very discoveries.Another example of anomalous science, which includes a possible electromagneticspectrum connection, is the Celtic round towers of Ireland. These fascinatingstructures, the tallest measuring 111.5 feet (34 meters), once numbered over ahundred. Many still stand today, and dot the Irish landscape. Based on the factthat nearly every tower is at the site of a known Celtic church dating from thefifth to twelfth centuries CE, scholars have suggested that the most probableconstruction period was between the seventh and tenth centuries CE. Initially,each of the towers were freestanding structures, but later, other buildings,primarily churches and monastic foundations, were constructed around some of thetowers.In his book, Irish Round Towers, Lennox Barrow states,It is remarkable how little the main dimensions vary. In the great majority oftowers the circumference at the base lies between 45.9–55.8 feet (14–17 meters)and the thickness of the wall at the lowest point at which it can be measuredvaries from 2.9–4.6 feet (0.9–14 meters). Doorways, windows, story heights, anddiameters also follow clearly defined patterns, and we may well conclude thatmost of the towers were the work of teams of builders who moved from onemonastery to another using standard designs. Most doorways are raised 4.9–14.8feet (1.5–4.5 meters) above the ground. This is usually explained as being forsecurity, to enable the monks to take refuge inside the towers during times whenViking raiders or bandits were attacking the monasteries.[../Images/image_13.jpg]Fig. 10.4. View of Irish round tower with conical cap intact. Photographcourtesy of SacredSites.com.There is probably some truth in this theory, but it has also been noted thatit’s possible that the stability of the tower had as much to do with the doorheights as anything else. Basic physics dictates that the higher you could buildbefore making an opening in the wall, the stronger the base would be. Very oftenthe towers were filled in, even as high as the doorways.This idea that the round towers were erected and used primarily as watchtowersand places of protection is strongly debated by the American scientist PhilipCallahan. In his book, Ancient Mysteries, Modern Visions, Callahan discussesresearch, which indicates that the round towers may have been designed,constructed, and utilized as huge resonant systems for collecting and storingyard-long wavelengths of magnetic and electromagnetic energy coming from theearth and skies.Based on fascinating studies of the forms of insect antenna and their capacityto resonate to micrometer-long electromagnetic waves, Professor Callahansuggests that the Irish round towers (and similarly shaped religious structuresthroughout the ancient world) were human-made antennae, which collected andtransmitted subtle magnetic radiation from the sun and passed it on to monksmeditating in the tower and plants growing around the tower’s base. The roundtowers were able to function in this way because of their form and also becauseof their materials of construction.Of the sixty-five towers that remain as ruins, twenty-five were built oflimestone, thirteen of iron-rich, red sandstone, and the rest of basalt, clayslate, or granite—all of these minerals having paramagnetic properties that canthus act as magnetic antennae and energy conductors. Callahan further statesthat the mysterious fact of various towers being filled with rubble for portionsof their interiors was not random, but rather may have been a method of “tuning”the tower antenna so that it more precisely resonated with various specificfrequencies.Equally intriguing is that Callahan shows that the seemingly random geographicalarrangement of the round towers throughout the Irish countryside actuallymirrors the positions of the stars in the northern sky during the time of wintersolstice.Archaeological excavations at the bases of the towers have revealed that manytowers were erected upon the tops of much older graves, and it is known thatmany of the tower sites were considered sacred places long before the arrival ofChristianity in Ireland. These facts point to the likelihood that the ancientIrish, like the Egyptians, the Mayans, and many other archaic cultures,understood there to be an energetic resonance between specific terrestriallocations and different celestial bodies. All across the Irish countrysideparticular locations were chosen, precisely designed structures were erected togather and store various energies, and a tradition of human spiritual use of thesites arose over the millennia. While many of the round towers are now crumblingand their antenna function may no longer be operative, many visitors feel that afield of energy still permeates the sites today.In another article, The Mysterious Round Towers of Ireland: Low Energy Radio inNature, from The Explorer’s Journal, Callahan gives further details of hisdiscoveries: “Most books will tell you that the towers were places of refuge forthe monks to hide from Vikings raiding Ireland. They were, no doubt, bell towersand lookouts for approaching raiders, but the speculations that monks escapedraiders, who no doubt knew how to smoke bees out of hives or climb the nine tofifteen feet to the door, borders on the ludicrous. Round towers are perfectlydesigned to be totally useless for hiding people or church treasures.”Callahan continues, “Another strange thing about the towers is the dirt thatfills the base below the high doors. Each door has a different level of dirtfilling the base, as if they were ‘tuned’ like a pipe organ. I had longpostulated that the towers were powerful amplifiers of radio resonance from theatmosphere generated by lightning flashes around the world.” Upon furtherinvestigation, Callahan concluded, “The round towers proved to be powerfulamplifiers in the alpha brain wave region, 2 to 24 Hz, in the electricalanesthesia region, 1,000 to 3,000 Hz, and the electronic induction heatingregion, 5,000 Hz to 1,000 kHz. . . . It is fascinating that just above thesurface of the ground to about two to four feet up there is a null ofatmospheric frequencies that get stronger and stronger until at nine to fifteenfeet above the surface they are extremely strong.”Were Irish monks aware of these properties, and thus prompted to build theirhigh doors? At every tower Callahan measured, there was a direct correlationbetween the height of the tower door and the strength of the waves. That thehighly amplified waves occur in the meditative and electrical anesthesia portionof the electromagnetic spectrum is of utmost significance. In 1963, G. Walterresearched brain EEG waves from 0.5 to 3 Hz (Delta region) and foundanti-infectious effects.It’s interesting to note that recent research, including experiments conductedat UCLA by professor Valery Hunt, has shown some positive effect ofelectromagnetic radiation fields. Subjects who were shielded from allelectromagnetic fields reported experiencing a mental breakdown, their brain nolonger able to function normally. Remove the electromagnetic shielding and“normal” brain function returns. When those subjects were exposed to intensifiedelectromagnetic fields, they reported a profound feeling of well-being. Othersexposed to electromagnetic fields under controlled conditions reportedhallucinatory visions similar to those reportedly experienced by shamans orindividuals in an altered state of consciousness, under the influence ofmind-altering substances.Additionally, research conducted in the 1980s by Dr. Michael Persinger atLaurentian University in Canada reported that subjects whose brains were bathedin low energy electromagnetic fields while wearing a modified helmet, whichPersinger designed, experienced a profound, otherworldly presence during theresearch sessions. Over 80 percent of the subjects involved in the experimentsreported experiencing the effect while under the influence of the induced andenhanced electromagnetic field.Perhaps also related to the Irish stone towers, are the many anomalous ancientstone structures, chambers, and circles found throughout New England. In thebook Celtic Mysteries of New England, authors Phillip Imbrogno and MarianneHorrigan note and measure unexplained electromagnetic anomalies at stone chamberlocations. The anomalies, described as “pulses,” seem to occur in a specificfrequency range beginning at 16.5 MHz, with peak signal strength occurring at1,675 MHz. The authors claim that this could be suggestive of a “doorway” or“portal” function of the chambers, with a burst of electromagnetic energyreleased whenever the door is opened or shut.I would suggest that, as opposed to a “portal” or “doorway” opening to anotherdimension of time and space, it might be more likely that the chambers’electromagnetic anomalies could indicate a communication channel or conduit forenergy, opening for use in some way.Lastly, it’s important to mention the groundbreaking work of research scientistJohn Burke, whose book Seed of Knowledge, Stone of Plenty: Understanding theLost Technology of the Ancient Megalith-Builders documents how electromagneticfields have a beneficial effect on crop yields when seeds have been exposed.Burke and his team tested electromagnetic hot spots at locations in the Midwestand in the northeast of the United States, including some of the stone chambersalready mentioned. They located and mapped naturally occurring spikes in theEarth’s electromagnetic field; locations that in many cases had long ago beenidentified and marked as “sacred” by local indigenous shamans. What they foundwas that seeds they brought to these locations and left for a time period wouldproduce more robust yields compared to a control group of seeds left in the lab.Is it possible that the purpose for which many of the sacred sites andmegalithic structures around the world were constructed was to receive orgather, process or focus, and transmit or distribute naturally occurringelectromagnetic energy? Could ancient people have been aware of the medicinaland consciousness-raising properties of electromagnetic fields? There is muchevidence to suggest that they were.THE INFANT FIELD OF RADIO ARCHAEOLOGYI would suggest a series of experiments, conducted to scientific methodstandards, to test and measure both the transmit and receive propagationproperties of prehistoric sites that meet specific criteria. Such tests shouldutilize carrier wave transmitters and spectrum-scanning receivers and software,along with spectrometers, spectrum analyzers, and oscilloscopes to determine ifpropagation properties are enhanced by the sacred site locations and/or siteconfiguration and construction materials.Someone once said that science is like a game of darts. The surface of thedartboard, albeit perhaps infinite, represents all the science there is to know.Each theory confirmed through experiment and scientific method represents a darthitting its mark on the dartboard of science. While the surface of the board mayhave many darts in it, most of it, as of yet, remains untouched by a dart. And,of course, sometimes one dart thrown may knock out a previously thrown dart fromits apparently secure location. In other words, there is still a great deal oftrue science yet to be discovered and confirmed, and perhaps some ideas that mayneed to be unlearned. Above all, the perspective with which we search is perhapsthe key to what we discover.An important lesson can be learned from the mechanism known as the AntikytheraDevice—discovered over a hundred years ago on the floor of the MediterraneanSea, the device has been found by archaeologists to be two thousand years old.Because the device suggests that the ancient Greeks had the mechanicalsophistication of eighteenth century Swiss watchmakers, historians and scholarshave generally ignored it. Could this device be evidence that a period oftechnological devolution, as a general trend, took place over many thousands ofyears in fields such as mathematics, mapmaking, mechanics, and more? Can thesame claim be made for wave and particle theory? Was much more known, muchearlier on, than current evidence supports or the academic world is willing toaccept?Nothing less than a major shift in the approach to these mysteries needs tooccur for a full debate and examination of the facts and theories to take placewithin the established academic community. The fact is that the AntikytheraDevice exists, as do many other anomalies of science. No, they don’t fit intothe context of established history, but to fail to consider them as part of alarger picture that is far from complete does a great disservice to the pursuitof knowledge.The ancients may have seen the electromagnetic forces of the universe as thesingle common denominator of nature, of all that exists in the physical as wellas nonphysical world. If so, they would have seen the electromagnetic spectrumas the medium on which all existence records itself. Learning to manipulate andharness the properties of that field would be the ultimate power, the power ofthe gods.From the first time a human tossed a pebble into a pond of water, the dynamics,properties, and laws of wave propagation were evident for him to examine andtest. In air as in water, these properties follow many consistent traits:Greater power creates larger waves, and waves could easily be regulated anddirected. Could it be that our ancestors understood the subtle properties ofelectromagnetic waves and particle fields and even manipulated them, harnessingthe power of nature and the power of the unseen spectrum? As if to give the gameaway, they placed clues for us to find. All of their rituals, their religions,cults, gods, demigods, the whole of their lives were linked to the cycles of theuniverse. And it is important to recognize that this is how the ancientsunderstood the powers of the universe, through their gods. Perhaps they did notconceive of electromagnetic power as we do, but rather as god-given signs andsignals, as the power of the gods, to be tapped into by humans."},{"pageContent":"E L E V E NTHE GULF OF KHAMBHATDOES THE CRADLE OF ANCIENT CIVILIZATION LIE OFF THE COAST OF INDIA?S. BADRINARYANIt was generally believed that well-organized civilizations could not haveexisted prior to 5500 BCE. Many were reluctant to accept the flood mythsmentioned in many ancient religious writings. The recent discovery made in theGulf of Khambhat, India, shocked many and made some sit up and watch withinterest. It clearly established the existence of an ancient civilization thatwas submerged in the sea. The methodology adopted was novel and different,wherein advanced marine technologies and the most modern scientific applicationsof various disciplines were put to best use. The traditional but conservativearchaeologists found it hard to accept that a major discovery could have beenmade by hitherto unapplied, unheard-of techniques. Some observed and understoodthe importance of the discovery and came out in open support.Initially, when the side-scan sonar images of underwater structures were shown,some called it the magic of computer software. When hundreds of artifacts werecollected and shown, traditional archaeologists opined that the artifacts couldhave been transported by using the ancient river! Detailed scientific studieswere again undertaken to prove that the artifacts are in situ. The criticism hasdriven us to adopt most modern technologies and scientific methodologiesavailable in the world, which have completely substantiated our findings, andthe results were published as research papers in reputed international journals.Now several authors are quoting the Gulf of Khambhat work as a standardbenchmark methodology for modern marine archaeological surveys andinvestigations. The discovery has clearly established the possibility of ancientcivilizations that were submerged due to flooding by rising seawaters after thelast ice age.The oldest city-state civilization was thought to be Mesopotamia, dating to 5500BCE. An extensive mature civilization also stood in the northwestern part ofIndia adjoining Pakistan and Afghanistan. This is the well-known “Harappan”civilization, which lasted between 5300 and 2800 BCE. This includes major ruinedcities like Mohenjo Daro, Harappa, and Dholavira, as well as villages, craftcenters, campsites, river stations, fortified places, and ports. The cities hadwell-lined streets, arranged in straight lines, proper drainage, sanitaryarrangements, and excellent water-conveying systems, including check dams forstoring water. Usage of a variety of artifacts, metallic objects, many types ofpotteries, and the construction of huge structures could not have happenedovernight. So there was obviously a major missing link between the ancienthunter-gatherer group of people and the “Harappan” civilization.In India, there were many Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic Stone Agecultures. But none of them have any remote resemblance to the type ofcivilization found in the Harappan sites. It is possible that the missing linkbetween the two is either undercover or has been submerged due to major sealevel rise caused by melting ice sheets. It is a well-established fact thatduring the last glacial maxima (ice age), the seas all over the world shrank;the sea level around 18,000 BCE was about 426.5 feet (130 meters) below thepresent-day sea level. So, it is logical to look for such submergedcivilizations near areas surrounding the present-day Indian coastal areas,especially along the paleochannel of various rivers.National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), an undertaking of the Indiangovernment, has been carrying out several multidisciplinary marine surveys alongthe Indian coastal areas for various purposes. During the course of a fewgeological surveys in Gujarat in the Gulf of Khambhat, NIOT came across riverpaleochannels in the sea. These were seen to be the extension of the present-daymajor rivers of the area.In a similar marine survey, in a coastal research ship during 1999–2000 when theauthor was the chief scientist, several unusual frames of side-scan sonar imageswere encountered. These had square and rectangular features in an arrangedgeometric fashion, which are not expected in the marine domain. Such featuresare unlikely to be due to natural marine geological processes. This made theauthor suspect that human workmanship must have been involved. The surveys werefollowed up by the author in the following years, and a couple of paleochannelsof old rivers were discovered in the middle of the Khambhat area under65.6–131.2 foot (20–40 meter) water depths, at a distance of about 12.4 miles(20 kilometers) from the present-day coast.The Gulf of Khambhat forms a funnel-shaped entrant of the Arabian Sea,sandwiched between mainland Gujarat and the Saurashtra peninsula in the west.This gulf is 83.9 miles (135 kilometers) long in a north-south direction, and ismore than 62.1 miles (100 kilometers) at its widest part. It is one of theroughest and most complicated seas of the world, and covers an area of about1,158.3 square miles (3,000 square kilometers). Several major rivers, includingthe Narmada, Tapi, Sabarmathi, Mahi, and the Chathranji, drain into it. It has amacro-tidal range of 39.4 feet (12 meters), and the currents are up to eightknots. The sea is often subjected to severe winds resulting in very roughconditions.This type of turbulence churns the seabed and produces enormous quantities ofsilt, making the seawater brownish and turbid, with the result that it isimpervious to light rays. The combined effect of these conditions makes thispart of the country unfit for diving and underwater operations, and makesunderwater videography impossible. Hence, only instruments operated on theprinciple of sound, like sonar and magnetic equipment, could work here. Thisincludes side-scan sonar, the sub-bottom profiler, and the multibeam ecosounder,apart from the marine magnetometer.The term “sonar” stands for “sound navigation and ranging.” Sonar is a sensingstrategy that measures features of an environment (or medium) by the way inwhich that environment transmits, reflects, and/or absorbs acoustic (sound)waves. The seabed is a little-understood environment due to its inaccessibilityand resistance to large scale detailed analysis. Sonar represents a clearapproach of looking at the seafloor.Side-scan sonar uses sound waves to produce images of the seafloor. The hardareas reflect more energy and are seen as dark shades, whereas softer areas donot reflect energy as well and are represented by lighter shades. This“backscatter” is absent behind objects or features that rise above the seafloor,and are represented as white shadows in the sonar image. The dimensions ofshadows are used to infer the size of the objects. The system used was a digitalone, which provides high-resolution sonar images of the seafloor throughadvanced digital technology in the 100 and 400 kHz frequency. The unit isconnected to a Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) for the accurateposition of the survey vessel and, in turn, that of the objects.In these surveys it was the side-scan sonar that gave excellent resultssupported by other systems. Initially two major paleochannels of rivers wererecognized. One was over a length of 5.7 miles (9.2 kilometers) and another over5.6 miles (9 kilometers). When these were sampled, it was seen that just below athin marine sediment cover of a few centimeters were river alluvium and pebblestypical of terrestrial river sediments, below which typical river conglomerateswere observed at depth. Such evidence clearly indicated that the area presentlyunder water was originally dry land, over which rivers were flowing. Due todifferent factors, they got submerged and now lie beneath the sea.The sonar images showed regular geometric patterns in one paleochannel over alength of 5.6 miles (9 kilometers) in the sea about 12.4 miles (20 kilometers)west of the Hazira coastal area. Associated with this on either side of thepaleochannel, basementlike features in a grid pattern were observed at a waterdepth of 65.6–131.2 feet (20–40 meters). These resemble an urban habitationsite; pitlike structures can be seen in the basement on the ocean floor. Anotherpaleochannel over 5.7 miles (9.2 kilometers) was detected off the Suvali coastalarea. Here, also, similar features were observed. In general, the basementlikefeatures were located in a linear east-west direction on either side of thepaleochannel. It is seen that these features are 16.4 by 13.1 feet (5 by 4meters) on the eastern side, whereas the westernmost part had dimensions of 52.5by 49.2 feet (16 by 15 meters). The habitation sites are all seen to be laid ina strict grid indicating a good sense of town planning by the ancients.There was also evidence of water conducting systems, including canals. All thesepoint to a properly planned township, with a high level of knowledge andpractice by the ancients. The area in general is seen to be covered by sandwaves, which occur above the seabed. Often these cover the dwelling, but eventhen the shapes could be made out. Apart from the regular sites of habitation,the side-scan sonar picked up images of several big structures. Some of thesestructures are as follows:There is a rectangular 134.5 by 82 feet (41 by 25 meters) shaped depression,wherein one can see steps gradually going down to reach a depth of about 23 feet(7 meters). Surrounding this depression, there is a wall-like projection on allsites. One could observe an inlet and outlet and also a separate enclosure. Thislooks like a tank or bathing facility now occurring below 131.2 feet (40 meters)of seawater. It occurs near the western periphery of the town. It resembles theGreat Bath that is found in the ruins of Mohenjo Daro and Harappa, where thesealso occur on the western side of the township. There are two divisions in thetank, which may represent separate enclosures for men and women or for sociallyhigher and lower categories of people. There are two openings, probably forinlet and exit of water to keep the water in the tank fresh and clean.In one of the structures one can observe a long, linear, prominent, andwell-made basement measuring 656.2 by 147.6 feet (200 by 45 meters). It nestleson high ground, and steps approach the structure on the right corner. Inside thestructure are several square-shaped, roomlike features that are 59 feet (18meters) and higher, and that are surrounded by fortifications.These structures resemble those of the Citadel area of Mohenjo Daro, Harappa,and Dholavira, where similar structures occur at the western extremity, again onhigh ground. The structure was likely an administrative building meant forsupervising the civic activities of the township, or could have been a place ofworship. Pieces of fossilized human and animal bones, as well as natural teeth,were recovered during sampling on the eastern side of the Citadel.The sonar image picked up a major, dilapidated structure measuring 623.4 by278.9 feet (190 by 85 meters), with spaces separated by what look like collapsedwalls. In front of the structure, on the bottom side, there are severalrectangular, 8.2 to 11.5 by 19.7 feet (2.5–3.5 by 6 meters) basement structuresresembling minor dwellings. These could have been ancient granaries for thetownship, probably with a dwelling place for the workers nearby. Some fossilizedfood grains had been collected in the neighboring areas. The granary is aregular feature in many of the Harappan sites.There is also a basement of a buried settlement, and it measures 242.8 by 157.5feet (74 by 48 meters). It has regular square, rectangular, and arch shapes. Thedarker portions are the elevated or standout features. These indicate that thereare still some constructed portions partly standing up. A few square andrectangular-shaped basements are also visible to the north of the structure.The main structure measures 131.2 by 62.3 feet (40 by 19 meters), with wall-likedark features rising to 6.6–9.8 feet (2–3 meters) above the seabed. A series ofsteplike features can be seen on the right side of the structure. To one cornerof the main structure, a 36 by 23 feet (11 by 7 meters) rectangular depressionthat looks like a small tank or pond can also be observed.Sub-bottom profiler surveys penetrate the seabed, instead of reflecting soundwaves from it a la side-scan sonar. The waves travel beneath the seabed indifferent formations in different speeds, and the instrument collects thereflection data over selected frequencies. It provides good depth information ongeological features, apart from delineating any suspected buried anthropogenicstructures.Standout features, which appear to be the basement and foundations of thestructure were picked up below the 656.2 by 147.6 feet (200 by 45 meters),citadel-like structure. These features were picked up at regular intervals. Itis observed that the foundations have been dug up to 16.4–19.7 feet (5–6 meters)in the soil, over which broad, columnlike features have been constructed,probably to help bear the load of the huge structure above.Below the buried settlement of the 242.8 by 157.5 feet (74 by 48 meters)structure are man-made foundations like columns that can be clearly seenemerging from below the seabed, and occur as standout features. Here, thefoundations have been dug up to 9.8–13.1 feet (3–4 meters) deep in the soil.This type of planning and construction by ancient peoples clearly reveals thatthey had a very good knowledge of civil and structural engineering, whereinbroader and deeper foundations were provided for bigger and heavier structures,and thinner and shallower foundations for comparatively smaller structures.Likewise, almost all of the structures, including the dwelling sites, indicate agood amount of planning and design, taking into consideration the structuralaspects.Magnetic surveys were carried out by deploying a high-resolution cesium vapormarine magnetometer. The survey was for observing magnetic signatures occurringas anomalies of subsurface magnetic bodies in the area. The instrument wascapable of sensing up to 0.001 nT (nano-tesla) at 1 sample rate. The values werecorrected for diurnal variation so as to remove the temporal variation in theEarth’s magnetic field. The corrected magnetic field value is a result of themarine magnetic components; regional geological features are very deep-seated inorigin and have depth persistence, whereas one should look for very shallow andnear-seabed anomalies that do not extend in depth. Several shallow, near-surfaceanomalies were picked up, ranging in depth from 3.3 feet (1 meter) below surfaceto as much as 164 feet (50 meters).The deep-seated anomalies are at least below 1,312.3 feet (400 meters) from theseabed surface. The near-surface anomalies are covered by top sediments ingeneral, and are likely to be archaeological sites, to be examined and exploredlater. Due to these surveys, a vast area has now acquired importance forarchaeological purposes—including areas that were not picked up earlier byside-scan images. These surveys therefore enhance the area of archaeologicalinterest. This was obviously an extensive civilization, the remains and ruins ofwhich have since been covered by shifting shoals, sand waves, and tectonism,which are very common features in the Gulf of Khambhat.Even though a variety of objects and artifacts were collected in settlements,doubts were expressed by some persons as to whether these could have beentransported by paleochannels and might, in fact, not be in situ. To clear upsuch doubts, detailed geochemical analyses were carried out. Ten geological soilsamples and ten artifacts were chosen from the Gulf of Khambhat area. Sincetrace elements like titanium, hafnium, and thorium—as well as rare earthelements (REE)—are immobile, they preserve their signature without alteration,and hence reflect their primary petrogenic character. These twenty selectedrepresentative samples were analyzed using an ICP mass spectrometer.The leaching of light rare earth elements and a prominent European anomalysuggests there is a one-to-one match between the archaeological material andKhambhat bed sediments. The ternary and binary plots of both the materials showthe clustering of all samples in one place, indicating the samples are of thesame host chemistry and are in situ. In other words, the archaeologicalmaterials are not transported, but are made from locally available materialonly.To substantiate the findings, detailed sampling was carried out. Since the seacondition was very rough, and the water turbid and brown, sampling was carriedout in areas where side-scan images show excellent results. The samples werecollected by utilizing a grab sampler, dredger, gravity corer, and vibro corer.Large numbers of samples were carefully collected, systematically numbered, andproperly preserved. The artifacts collected included a variety of potterypieces, Mesolithic stone tools, a few Paleolithic macro stone tools, beads madeof semiprecious stones, brick pieces, hearth material, wattle and daub structurematerials, corals, perfectly holed stones, fossilized human remains, and humanteeth.Three potsherd pieces were also unearthed. These are unfired and normallysun-dried, made of clay, and are of great antiquity. They display a crosslikeobject and some figurines. There is also a piece in the shape of a deer’s head,and a well-turned ornamental piece with a straight hole in the center. How theancients were able to make these in stone is still an enigma.Four additional, important objects were unearthed. The first was a fossilizedjawbone (mandible) with a natural tooth kept in front. The second object waspart of a carbonized wooden log. This was obtained from the top stratigraphiccolumn at a depth of about 30–40 centimeters below the seabed, and was sent fordating. Also unearthed were rolled objects and long linear beads that, whenstrung together, form a necklace. As well, linear beads made of stone werefound, with holes in the middle.A series of Microlithic tools were collected at various locations. Microlithictools are generally characteristic of the Mesolithic period and are foundbetween Paleolithic and Neolithic Stone Age periods. The characteristic featuresof Mesolithic tools are that, unlike the earlier Paleolithic stone tools, theseare much smaller, normally between one to five centimeters in length, and aremade of finely crafted semiprecious stones. These include quartz, chert, jasper,flint, chalcedony, agate, and corundum. About 248 such tools were collected bysampling. The tools included a baked blade with a serrated edge, point, point onflakes, lunate, scraper, cores with negative chipping, and a borer. The toolshave both geometric and nongeometric forms.The Mesolithic period of western India revealed the existence of their culturalphases, namely aceramic and ceramic. In general, the Mesolithic sites confirmedthe existence of a ceramic phase in its later part, containing other materialsbesides potteries and Microlithic tools, like wattle and clay shreds for houseconstruction and flooring. The Mesolithic sites are comparatively larger. Herethe hunting and gathering way of life was replaced by organized food production.Holed stones that appeared in the late Paleolithic became prominent in theMesolithic. These holed stones appear to have been used as weights in diggingsticks and as net sinkers by the fishing folks. In general, a sedentary form ofliving heralded the beginning of other associated cultural artifacts likepottery, living in well-built houses like wattle and clay, or of sun-dried andfired bricks.A variety of classic collections of Microlithic tools were made. These include athumbnail scraper to skin the small animals, with an obliquely truncated flutedcore made of red corundum apart from borers and points. Usage of corundum issomething unique, as it is the second hardest material known after diamond (asper the Mohs scale of hardness). The red and blue transparent varieties ofcorundum are the gemstones ruby and sapphire. This is the first reported usageof corundum as a microlithic tool in India, and maybe in the world.Other tools include a Microlithic blade made of chert and quartz for cuttingpurposes, a Microlithic side scraper, and a Microlithic tool point with aserrated edge. Apart from these, pieces of hearth material have been collected.These were used for firing and heating, and hence are very good for datingpurposes. Pieces of lightweight, hollow circlelike materials have been collectedin various places. These may be slag pieces from the extraction of metal; theancients might have had some knowledge of metallurgy.Pottery pieces of various types have been collected. These include a brokenbowl, coarse red-ware, pottery pieces embedded in mud walls, slow-wheel-turnedpottery pieces, pieces of jar lid, pottery pieces with some cord impression anda very ancient fragment of pottery, possibly amongst the oldest so far collectedanywhere in the world.Even though most of the artifacts are of the Mesolithic period, there were somePaleolithic tools that were much older. It shows that people have been living inthe Khambhat area for quite some time. One example is the bifacial scraper, avery characteristic Upper Paleolithic stone tool made of chert. Similar stonetools were also present—but many of them, due to long submergence and rolling inthe seabed, appear to have had their edges smoothed out.A thorough examination of the macro and micro levels of soil in the Gulf ofKhambhat brought to light a wealth of plant material typical of the land domain.Extensive studies are being carried out by a botany professor, and the studiesmay initiate a new branch in marine archaeology, perhaps called “marinearchaeobotany.” So far, prominent plant species identified include palm,coconut, bamboo, and the areca plant. Many of them are fossilized.All these were recognized under the microscope. The major wooden log, when takenout of the seabed, was very fresh, dark, and hard, and showed growth rings.Within a couple of days of exposure to the atmosphere, the wooden log shrankcompletely and developed cracks. It has given an important date to the area.This species has been tentatively identified as hardwood, much like rosewood.All these facts point to well-grown trees and foliage, with lots of good freshwater and a somewhat warm climate at the time of their growth in the area.Hard dark alluvium and typical river conglomerate are found in the paleochannelbelow the seabed. They clearly indicate a freshwater alluvial environment.Several in situ pieces of alluvium and conglomerate have been collected. Allthese factors clearly establish that the paleochannels were originallywell-flowing rivers in the land, which were subsequently submerged by the sea.As some people have expressed doubts about the pottery pieces, a thoroughscientific study was made involving the pottery pieces to establish theirauthenticity. To determine the properties of various materials, includingpottery, many samples were subjected to X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Sincethe materials that constitute pottery are clays, and a heterogeneous mixture ofa variety of materials, these were analyzed accordingly. Every area has aspecial fingerprint pattern in the clay, which can be recognized under X-raydiffraction.The above analysis was carried out in Deccan College, Pune, in the state ofMaharashtra, India, by using an advanced instrument, the energy dispersive X-Rayfluorescence spectrometer that gave excellent results. The conclusion is thatthe pattern of pottery pieces corresponds very well with the locally availableclay of the Gulf of Khambhat. The mineral patterns of habitational floor, wattleand daub, and land materials (alluvial deposit) are comparable. The patterns offired clay, brick floor pieces, and vitrified clay compare very well.All these indicate that they are genuine artifacts, made from locally availablematerial, and are in situ. It fully confirms the presence of archaeologicalsites. The findings indicate that the pottery was produced locally withlevigated clay, fired uniformly at about 700°C. From the presence of calcite inclay and pottery, arid to semi-arid environmental conditions prior to thesubmergence of the site could be deduced. Calcitized alluvial deposits indicatethe existence of ancient rivers that once flowed in the submerged regions of theGulf of Khambhat.Dating of Samples: Most of the structures that were discovered in the Gulf ofKhambhat had many similarities to the Citadel, Great Bath, and grid-iron patternhabitation site granary of the Harappan civilization. However, many of theartifacts and typology were very different and distinctive, and, with thepresence of so many microtools, appeared to be much older than the Harappan. Toestablish the credibility and age of the civilization, it was essential to datedifferent objects and artifacts to establish the period of the Khambhatcivilization.There are many different types of dating of archaeological artifacts—carbondating, thermoluminescence, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating,accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dating, dendrochronology archaeomagnetism,electron spin resonance dating, Potassium-Argon dating, and cation-ratio dating.In all, about twenty-three datable objects were selected, covering both of thepaleochannels. From the samples obtained from the marine archaeological sites,it was clear that the following methods would be most suitable, and a fairlyaccurate age determination can be obtained from them. These are ¹⁴C radiocarbondating, radiocarbon dating by accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS),thermoluminescence (TL), and optically stimulated luminescence.Radiocarbon dating is a method for obtaining age estimates on organic material,and is effective from the present back to a maximum of 50,000 BCE. Radioactivecarbon (¹⁴C) is produced in the atmosphere and is absorbed by plants; theradioactive carbon enters the human and animal cycle when the plants are eatenby animals and human beings. The absorbing of ¹⁴C is stopped when a livingorganism dies, and ¹⁴C starts to disintegrate. How much ¹⁴C is disintegrated andhow much is left out can be measured, and the rate at which it disintegrates isknown. From this the age of organic objects like trees, corals, human remains,and shells can be determined. For age determination tests, about 50–100 g oforganic material is necessary.In the AMS, a much smaller organic sample on the order of 1–2 milligrams isenough to calculate the age. This has several advantages over the regular ¹⁴Cmethod. The thermoluminescence (TL) method is mainly used for rocks, soilmaterials, pottery, and other materials that were fired. It is based on theprinciple that almost all natural minerals are thermoluminescent. Energyabsorbed from ionizing radiation frees electrons, which are trapped. Laterheating releases the trapped electrons, producing light. Measurement of theintensity of the light can be used to determine how much time has passed sincethe last time the object was heated. Natural radioactivity causes TL to buildup, so that the older an object is, the more light is produced. Since a certainamount of heating (generally up to 350°C) is required, TL works best forceramics, cooking hearths, fired bricks, fire cracked rocks, or fire treatedminerals such as flint or chert.OSL is similar to TL dating. The minerals in the sediment grains are sensitiveto light; when exposed to light, the electrons vacate the sediment grains. Thisprocess is called recombination, or a clock-setting event. To detect the age,the comparison must be made between sediment grain with a known amount of addedradiation and sediment grains that are acted upon naturally. This method issuitable for a variety of unheated sediments not older than 500,000 years. Thisincludes silty and sandy sediments that are deposited by water.The selected samples for various types of dating were sent to some reputedinstitutes in India, Oxford University in England, and to Hannover, Germany.Some samples were repeated in different institutes to get confirmation of theage. The results tallied very well. The datable objects were selected torepresent both of the paleochannels. However, comparatively fewer datablesamples were obtained from the southern paleochannel. In the northernpaleochannel, alluvial samples were collected at different depths to gain anidea about the age of alluvium, as well as the river. Of the twenty-three totalsamples that were dated, the ¹⁴C method was followed in four samples, the TLmethod in six samples, and the OSL in thirteen samples.The alluvium samples of the northern paleochannel were tested by ManipurUniversity at the behest of NIOT. The top alluvium collected just below marinesediment was dated to around 3000 BCE, and a slightly lower alluvium gave an ageof about 5000 BCE. A black alluvium that was somewhat semi-consolidated, andcollected above the river conglomerate, gave an age of 19,000 BCE. Obviously theriver has been flowing at least between 19,000 BCE, prior to glacial maxima, andup to 3000 BCE. This shows that the paleochannel in the north was active, and ariverine regime existed from at least about 19,000 BCE. As the area and thepaleochannel to the south were proven to be a hydrocarbon-rich zone, severaloil- and gas-producing wells and platforms have been put up along with Christmastrees, and several oil and gas pipelines are crisscrossing the area. Due tothese factors, no further sampling beyond the preliminary one could beundertaken in view of the safety and restrictions in the oil production areas.The water depths of the alluvial samples collected in the northern paleochannelvaried from 20 to 32 meters.In the southern township or paleochannel area, six samples suitable for datingwere identified. Of these, three are carbonized wooden samples, one was asediment sample, one was a fired pottery piece, and one was hearth material.Samples from the same carbonized wood were sent to National Geophysical ResearchInstitute, Hyderabad, India, and Geowissenschaftliche Gemeinschaftsaufgabe,Hannover, Germany, for carbon dating. This was the first sample (Location 21°03.08' N; 72° 30.83' E) from near the southern paleochannel. This first gave aclue to the age and environment of the civilization. The calibrated age, as perNGRI, was 9580–9190 BCE and, as per Hannover Institute, was 9545–9490 BCE. Itmeans that the age is about 9500 BCE, more than four thousand years older thanthe oldest city civilization of Mesopotamia and a forerunner to the Harappancivilization. But this occurred near the top of the stratigraphic column.Because of this, it was expected that at the lower levels the age would be mucholder, showing that the civilization could be a truly ancient one.The wooden piece tested at Birpal Sani Institute at Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, gavea calibrated age of 8450 BCE. However, two important artifacts were obtained ina nearby area at lower levels. These were a nice, thin pottery and a brownish tored hearth material. A local clay sediment was also chosen along with it. Allthree samples were analyzed in the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad,Gujarat State, using standard thermoluminescence-based pottery datingtechniques. As expected, the one of the pottery piece whose figure is given,gave a date of 13,000 ±1950 BCE. This is an important date.Another pottery piece that was ill-fired, on OSL dating (Location 21° 12.54' N;72° 30.370' E) by Oxford University gave an age of 16,840 ±2620 BCE. These arethe oldest fired pottery pieces obtained so far in the world. Previous to this,Japanese pottery was the oldest known in the world. The “Jomon” pottery from theFukui cave in Kyushu gave 12,000 BCE uncalibrated age. The pottery findings fromOdai Yamamoto gave an uncalibrated age of 13,800–13,500 BCE. In the Gulf ofKhambhat, attempts appear to have been made in experimental potterymaking. Thisis determined from the effects of fired clay (for making pottery), which gavethe ages of 20,130 ±2170 BCE (Location 21° 13.720' N; 72° 26.190' E) and 16,600±1150 BCE (Location 21° 13.80' N; 72° 26.10' E) by OSL, as determined by theOxford University dating lab. The well-fired three potteries in the northernpaleochannel gave ages of 7506 ±785 BCE, 6097 ±611 BCE (both by ManipurUniversity) and 4330 ±1330 BCE by Oxford University.Apart from this sun-dried pottery, other pieces were collected in these areas.Three of the specimens were dated by OSL facility in Oxford. The resultsobtained are:1. 31,270 ±2050 BCE2. 25,700 ±2790 BCE3. 24,590 ±2390 BCEA black slipped dish, which was also sun dried, was dated in Oxford by OSL. Thisgave an age of 26,710 ±1950 BCE. The hearth material from the southern township(Location 21° 03.04' N; 72° 30.70' E) by TL dating from Physical ResearchLaboratory, Ahmedabad, gave an age of 10,000 ±1500 BCE, whereas the hearthmaterial near the top in the northern township gave an age of 3530 ±330 BCE byOSL, at Oxford University. One of the charcoal pieces obtained on the northernside was tested by ¹⁴C dating in BSIP, Lucknow. It gave the calibrated age of3000 BCE. It tallies very well with the age of uppermost alluvium in thenorthern paleochannel.The wattle and daub materials that were originally of wood and clay were seen tobe burnt, but the structure of the wood was well preserved at places (beingfossilized). These were tested by OSL at Oxford and by TL at Manipur from thesame locations. OSL dating found it to be 5860 ±720 BCE, and TL datingdetermined it to be 5530 ±550 BCE. They appear to be a comparatively good matchand they reflect the proper ages. They may represent the period at which thesestructures caught fire.From this information it is quite clear that human activity is evident fromabout 31,000 BCE in what is now the Gulf of Khambhat, long before the glacialmaxima at 18,000 BCE. The ancients were making potteries and getting them dried,initially in the sun. From about 20,000 BCE on, it is clear that the ancientswere firing the clay to produce pottery. That means they knew how to make,maintain, and manage fire. They appear to have succeeded in making fired potteryfrom about 16,800 BCE. They knew the art of construction of towns and houses inneat straight lines, row after row, as picked up by side-scan sonar images (alsothe use of wattle and daub structures and rammed floor).Both the northern and southern townships have continuous habitation sitesinterspersed with large structures in between, but good quality fired potterymakes its appearance from about 13,000 BCE on—in the southern township (we cancall them metropolises), there appears to be organized activity in the form ofcommunity living, and a granary (where fossilized food grains were collected).To the south of this township, in the Gulf of Khambhat, side-scan sonar pickedup a drowned dead coral colony about 1,312.3 feet (400 meters) long and 65.6feet (20 meters) wide in water depths of about 131.2 feet (40 meters),substantiated later by sampling. It is a well-known fact that these corals livein hardly 6.6 to 9.8 feet (2–3 meters) water depth very near coastal areas. Theyrequire a clean environment and good sunlight.Obviously, the southern metropolis appears to have been near a seacoast at aparticular point of time, when the metropolis itself stood on dry land with agood free-flowing river, and was a major bustling city. The dating of coralcolonies by drill core, like other places, will provide the date of thebeginning of coral build-up in the area, and the top sample of coral will revealthe age at which it was drowned, giving a direct clue to the drowning of thesouthern metropolis. It is worthwhile to note that the datable objects, asfound, only date up to 8450 BCE, based on the age of the carbonized wood.The northern metropolis has well-made pottery pieces, wattle and daub, and so onfrom about 7506 BCE onward. This indicates well-organized city living. Hence itis possible that this metropolis sprang up after 8450 BCE, but long before 7506BCE, perhaps after the submergence of the southern metropolis. The ancientsappear to have shifted and founded the northern metropolis. However, the variousearlier dates from sun-dried pots and other materials indicate that it was underconstant habitation.EVIDENCE FROM MICROLITHIC TOOLSApart from Paleolithic macro tools, several pieces of micro tools have beencollected. Usage of such tools has been reported in America, Europe, and otherplaces. In South America, especially Brazil, the presence of human beings isreported from 14,000 BCE and on, coinciding with big Pleistocene mammals.Research indicated that between 17,000 and 7000 BCE, most coastal plains werelost due to sea level rise. Several Microlithic tools that were recovered areseen to occur from 10,970 BCE. But the Lagoa Santa people occupying these areasin Brazil suddenly disappeared between 8000 and 7000 BCE. In Europe, in France,Germany, Belgium, and other countries, the Microlithic tool period startedaround 11,800 BCE, taking back the age of the Mesolithic period. The Microlithicperiod spread to several areas and lasted up to the seventh millennium BCE.In the Gulf of Khambhat, a variety of Microlithic tools have been obtained incontinuation of late Paleolithic tools. The presence of highly evolvedexperimental pottery from 13,000 BCE, organized living, sedentary well-plannedhabitation, and advanced sanitary and town planning activities in the southernmetropolis indicates that it had developed to be a established civilization fromabout 13,000 BCE. There was already evidence for the control of fire and themaking of pottery from about 16,840 BCE and on. The southern metropolis has sofar provided datable objects up to 8500 BCE.The well-developed northern metropolis has dates of civilization from about 7506BCE. One should take into consideration the ideas of Graham Hancock, who alsopostulated that several cultures in near-coastal areas have been flooded andsubmerged by rising sea levels caused by the melting of icecaps subsequent tothe last ice age. The inundation maps prepared by Dr. Glen Milne of DurhamUniversity, England, clearly show that the Gulf of Khambhat area prior to 7600BCE was mostly land, and after 6900 BCE it is mostly submerged. This type ofrise in sea level is very much supported by the work of Dr. P. K. Banerjee,pertaining to the southeast coast of India, the work of Shahidul Islam and M. J.Tooley in the Bay of Bengal in Bangladesh and Sen and Banerjee’s work nearCalcutta.The area is highly prone to severe seismicity. In the past five hundred years,several earthquakes have shaken the area, including the major 8.0 magnitudeRichter scale event on January 26, 2001. On January 16, 1819, an 8.3 magnitudeevent devastated several nearby areas. These quakes cause a lot of subsidence atsome places, and elevation at other places.In the Gulf of Khambhat itself, various surveys have picked up fault zones andearthquake-affected areas with throws up to as much as 98.4 feet (30 meters)(elevation and depression). The Gulf of Khambhat was formed by a major rift. Tounderstand the phenomenon and paleoseismic activity, NIOT commissioned Dr.Rajendran of CESS, Trivandrum, to carry out paleoseismic studies in the areasurrounding the Gulf of Khambhat. His path-breaking work of identifyingpaleoseismic events and dating them with OSL—and also dating nearby organicmaterial—has given excellent evidence to support the findings. He detected thepresence of sand blow layers caused by old earthquakes as well as new ones. Hiswork in peripheral land areas of the Gulf of Khambhat, like Kathana, Lotal, andMotibaur, gave evidence of major earthquakes in the Khambhat areas in thefollowing periods:1. 2780 ±150 BCE2. 3983 ±150 BCE3. 7540 ±130 BCEHerein lies the evidence of the end of the Gulf of Khambhat civilization. In amajor event at about 7600 BCE, the southern metropolis appears to have beencollapsed by faulting, and sunk underwater. Because of this, the people appearto have proceeded north in the elevation higher than the sea level, andestablished the second or northern metropolis. This was also affected byfaulting due to earthquakes around 4000 BCE, and was destroyed and submerged byan earthquake in 2780 BCE (±150 years). In this connection, it is worthwhile topoint out three important aspects:The folk songs (in local Kachchi dialogue) mention about four major towns of theancient past. Three of these have been identified as Mohenjo Daro, Harappa, andDholavira. (Obviously the fourth one, and the biggest and oldest of them all, isthe Gulf of Khambhat metropolis.)The second aspect is work by other agencies describing small-scale stone ruinsnear the Gulf of Kutch, at the present-day town of Dwarka, as the remains of theancient, fabled city of Dwaraka—so aptly described as the abode of Lord Krishna,of Mahabharata fame. The city is said to have been completely transgressed bythe sea, and this is vividly described by Arjuna, Krishna’s main disciple in theMahabharata epic.The puzzling, incoherent aspect is the location of the city of Dwaraka. Thetemple we see today is hardly 900 years old. The area all around is dry, void ofvegetation, and with brackish water. Krishna is supposed to have maintained ahuge army of men, as well as animals such as elephants and horses. There areabsolutely no trees or foliage or fresh water for a big army, so the locationstrikes a discordant note. But the submerged metropolis of the Gulf of Khambhathas strong, powerful flowing rivers, lots of trees and foliage, and a hugetownship of truly ancient times. So the metropolis in the Gulf of Khambhat couldlikely be the “Dwaraka City” of the Mahabharata.The third aspect to consider is what happened when the first and secondmetropolis got submerged. It is interesting to note that there are about fivehundred Harappan and pre-Harappan settlements in Gujarat, of which about 258 areon the peripheral areas of the Gulf of Khambhat. All of them are younger thanthe southern Gulf of Khambhat metropolis. To the immediate west of the Gulf ofKhambhat on the Saurashtra Coast is the well-known pre-Harappan and Harappanarchaeological site of Padri. It has been established by the Deccan Collegeresearchers that the river Chatranji, which is now flowing east into the Gulf ofKhambhat, originally flowed west, but was tilted toward the east by large-scalestructural changes.By connecting it to the southern paleochannel and extending it, it is seen to goto Prabhas Patan in the Arabian sea, a well-known pre-Harappan archaeologicalsite mentioned in the Mahabharata epic. To the east, the paleochannel is seen tobe an extension of the present-day Tapi River. Obviously the river was flowingright up to Prabhas Patan on the Arabian sea prior to the drifting and formationof the Gulf of Khambhat. It now falls into the Gulf of Khambhat instead of theArabian sea. The ancients, after the catastrophe and submergence in the Gulf ofKhambhat, appear to have spread out all over Gujarat and then to the surroundingareas to establish a continuing and evolving civilization of Harappan type.So, from the foregoing it is very evident that the prehistoric civilization thatmatured and developed in the present-day Gulf of Khambhat was the forerunner andmodel of the subsequent advanced Harappan civilization known to history. Thiswonderful twin prehistoric metropolis of Khambhat lasted from about 13,000–3000BCE, making it the most ancient and largest city not only in Asia but in theentire world. It is seen to be at least 7,500 years older than the oldestMesopotamian city. However, strong evidence supports the presence of humans,from at least 31,000 BCE, who were evolving and developing, and who formed agreat hitherto unknown civilization that was submerged by the flood, givingcredence to local and global flood myths."},{"pageContent":"T W E L V ETHE ORION ZONEANCIENT STAR CITIES OF THE AMERICAN SOUTHWESTGRAY A. DAVIDORION OF THE HIGH DESERTTo watch Orion ascend from the eastern horizon and assume its dominant winterposition at the meridian is a wondrous spectacle. Even more so, it is astartling epiphany to see this constellation rise out of the red dust of thehigh desert as a stellar configuration of Anasazi cities built between themid-eleventh century and the end of the thirteenth century CE. The sky looksdownward to find its image made manifest in the Earth, while the Earth gazesupward, reflecting on the unification of terrestrial and celestial.Extending from the giant hand of Arizona’s Black Mesa that juts down from thenortheast, three great fingers of rock beckon. They are the three Hopi mesas,isolated upon this desolate but starkly beautiful landscape to which the AncientOnes so long ago were led. Directing our attention to this “Center of theWorld,” we clearly see the close correlation to Orion’s Belt.Mintaka, a double star and the first of the trinity to peek over the easternhorizon as the constellation rises, corresponds to Oraibi and Hotevilla on Third(or West) Mesa. The former village is the oldest continuously inhabitedcommunity on the continent, founded in the early twelfth century.Approximately seven miles to the east, located at the base of Second (or Middle)Mesa, the village of Shungopavi (initially known as Masipa, a cognate of theHopi underworld deity Masau’u) was reputedly the first to be established afterthe Bear Clan migrated into the region around the year 1100 CE. Its celestialcorrelative is Alnilam, the middle star of the belt.About seven miles farther east on First (or East) Mesa, the adjacent villages ofWalpi, Sichomovi, and Hano (or Tewa)—the first of which was established prior to1300 CE—correspond to the triple star Alnitak, rising as the last of the threestars of the belt.Nearly due north of Third Mesa’s Oraibi at a distance of just over fifty-sixmiles is Betatakin Ruin in Tsegi Canyon, while about four miles beyond is KeetSeel Ruin. Located in Navajo National Monument, both of these spectacular cliffdwellings were built during the mid-thirteenth century. Their siderealcounterpart is the double star Rigel, the left foot or knee of Orion. (We areconceptualizing Orion as viewed from the front.)Due south of Oraibi at an equal distance of fifty-six miles is Homol’ovi RuinsState Park, a group of four Anasazi pueblos constructed between themid-thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries. These represent the irregularlyvariable star Betelgeuse, the right shoulder of Orion.Forty-seven miles southwest of Oraibi is the primary Sinagua ruin at WupatkiNational Monument, surrounded by a few smaller ruins. (“Sinagua” is thearchaeological term for a group culturally similar and contemporaneous to theAnasazi.) Built in the early twelfth century, their celestial counterpart isBellatrix, a slightly variable star forming the left shoulder of Orion.About fifty miles northeast of First Mesa’s village of Walpi is the mouth ofCanyon de Chelly and its eponymous national monument. In this and its sidecanyon, Canyon del Muerto, a number of Anasazi ruins dating from themid-eleventh century are found. Saiph, the triple star forming the right foot orknee of Orion, corresponds to these ruins—primarily White House, Antelope House,and Mummy Cave.Extending northwest from Wupatki/Bellatrix, Orion’s left arm holds a shield overnumerous smaller ruins in Grand Canyon National Park, including Tusayan nearDesert View on the south rim. Reaching southward from Homol’ovi/Betelgeuse,Orion’s right arm holds a nodule club above his head. This club stretches acrossMogollon Rim (an escarpment that cuts east to west across northern Arizona) anddown to the Hohokam ruins near modern-day Phoenix. (The “Hohokam” was an earliergroup than the two previously mentioned. They used irrigated farming methods,rather than dry.)The head of Orion is a small stellar triangle formed by Meissa at its apex andby Phi-1 and Phi-2 Orionis at its base. It correlates to the Sinagua ruins atWalnut Canyon National Monument, together with a few smaller ruins in theimmediate region.If we conceptualize Orion not as the rectangle but as a polygon of seven sidesappended to another triangle, whose base rests on the constellation’s shoulders,we see that the relative proportions of the terrestrial Orion coincide withamazing accuracy. The apparent distances between the stars as we see them in theconstellation (as opposed to actual light-year distances), and the distancesbetween these major Hopi villages or Anasazi/Sinagua ruin sites, are closeenough to suggest that something more than mere coincidence is at work here.For instance, four of the sides of the polygon—A, Betatakin to Oraibi; B, Oraibito Wupatki; C, Wupatki to Walnut Canyon; and F, Walpi to Canyon de Chelly—areexactly proportional, while the remaining three sides—D, Walnut Canyon toHomol’ovi; E, Homol’ovi to Walpi; and G, Canyon de Chelly back to Betatakin—areslightly stretched in relation to the constellation—from between ten miles inthe case of D and E and twelve miles in the case of G. (Please see figure 12.1)[../Images/image_14.jpg]Fig. 12.1. Orion as a polygon of seven sides.This variation could be due in part either to possible cartographic distortionsof the contemporary sky chart in relation to the geographic map, or to ancientmisperceptions of the proportions of the constellation vis-à-vis the landscape.Given the physical exigencies for building a village, such as springs or rivers(which are not prevalent in the desert anyway), this is a striking correlation,despite these small anomalies in the overall pattern.As John Grigsby says in his discussion of the relationship between the templesof Angkor in Cambodia and the constellation Draco: “If this is a fluke then it’san amazing one. . . . There is allowance for human error in the transference ofthe constellation on to a map, and then the transference of the fallible map onto a difficult terrain over hundreds of square kilometers with no method ofchecking the progress of the site from the air.”*7[../Text/ch21.html#anchor_1986_0]In this case we are not dealing with Hindu/Buddhist temples, but with multiple“star cities,” sometimes separated from each other by more than fifty miles.Furthermore, the “map” is actually represented on a number of stone tabletsgiven to the Hopi at the beginning of their migrations. This geodeticconfiguration was influenced or even specifically determined by a divinepresence—namely, Masau’u, god of death, the underworld, and the Earth plane.Referring to the table below, we also notice the angular correspondences ofOrion-on-the-Earth to Orion-in-the-Sky. Here, again, the visual reciprocity isstartling enough to make us doubt that mere coincidence is responsible. Usingthe Bersoft Image Measurement software, however, we can correlate in degrees theprecise angles of this pair of digital images seen in the diagram.[../Images/image_15.jpg]The closest correlation is between the left and right shoulders (BC and DErespectively) of the terrestrial and celestial Orions, with only about twodegrees difference between the two pairs of angles. In addition, the left andright legs (AG and FG respectively) are within the limits of recognizablecorrespondence, with approximately 6–8 degrees of difference. The only anglesthat vary considerably are those that represent Orion’s head (CD), with over 15degrees of difference between terra firma and the firmament. Given the wholepolygonal configuration, however, this discrepancy is not enough to rule out agenerally close correspondence between Orion Above and Orion Below.SOLSTICE INTERRELATIONSHIP OF VILLAGESAnother factor that precludes mere chance in this mirroring of sky and earth isthe angular positioning of the terrestrial Orion in relation to longitude.According to their cosmology, the Hopi place importance on intercardinaldirections—that is, northwest, southwest, southeast, and northeast—rather thancardinal directions. The Anasazi could not, of course, make use of the compass,but relied instead upon solstice sunrise and sunset points on the horizon fororientation.The Sun Chiefs (in Hopi, tawa-mongwi) still perform their observations of theeastern horizon at sunrise from the winter solstice on December 22 (azimuth 120degrees) through the summer solstice on June 21 (azimuth 60 degrees), when thesun god Tawa is making his northward journey. On the other hand, they study thewestern horizon at sunset from June 21 (azimuth 300 degrees) through December 22(azimuth 240 degrees), when Tawa travels south from the vicinity of what theHopi call the Sipapuni to the San Francisco Peaks southwest of the Hopi mesas.(An azimuth is defined as the arc of the horizon measured in degrees clockwisefrom the true north point. The Sipapuni is the name for the Hopi entrance to theunderworld in the Grand Canyon, located near the confluence of the LittleColorado River and the Colorado River. The San Francisco Peaks near the town ofFlagstaff are the highest mountains in Arizona and are considered sacred to boththe Hopi and the Navajo.)A few days before and after each solstice, Tawa seems to stop—the term solsticeliterally meaning “the sun to stand still”—and rest in his winter or summerTawaki, or “house.” In fact, the winter Soyal ceremony is performed in part toencourage the sun to reverse his direction and return to Hopiland instead ofcontinuing southward and eventually disappearing altogether.The key solstice points on the horizon that we designate by the azimuthaldegrees of 60, 120, 240, and 300 degrees (only at this specific latitude,however) recur in the relative positioning of the Anasazi sky cities. Forinstance, if we stand on the edge of Third Mesa in the village of Oraibi on thewinter solstice, we watch the sun set at exactly 240 degrees on the horizon,directly in line with the ruins of Wupatki almost fifty miles away. The sundisappears over Humphreys Peak, the highest mountain in Arizona, where the majorshrine of the katsinam (also spelled kachinas, beneficent supernatural beingswho act as spiritual messengers) is located.Incidentally, if this line between Oraibi and the San Francisco Peaks isextended southwest, it intersects the small pueblo called King’s Ruin in BigChino Valley, once a stop-off point on the major trade route from the ColoradoRiver. If the line is extended still farther southwest, it intersects the mouthof Bill Williams River on the Colorado.Inhabited from 1026 CE (or possibly earlier in light of the underlying pithouse) to about 1300 CE, King’s Ruin has a thirteen-room foundation, twelve ofwhich could have been two stories high. The 500 pieces of unworked shell foundat the site indicate substantial trade with the Pacific. Necklaces of turquoise,black shale, and red argillite were also found. One argillite necklace,consisting of 2,031 beads, stretched sixty-six inches long. Fifty-five graveswere also discovered, containing sixty-six individuals, most of which wereburied in the extended posture with heads oriented toward the east, awaitingPahana’s (or the White Brother’s) return.[../Images/image_16.jpg]If we stand at Wupatki during the summer solstice, we see the sun rise directlyover Oraibi on Third Mesa at 60 degrees azimuth on the horizon. On that same daythe sun sets at 300 degrees azimuth, to which the left arm of the terrestrialOrion points. In addition, from Oraibi the summer solstice sun sets 12 degreesnorth of the Sipapuni near the Colorado River, the “Place of Emergence” of theHopi from the previous Third World (or era) to the current Fourth World.If we perch on the edge of Canyon de Chelly, not looking downward into thecanyon but instead southwest at the winter solstice sunset, the sun on thehorizon appears about 5 degrees south of the First Mesa village of Walpi. Thisline, extended farther southwest beyond the horizon, intersects both SunsetCrater, a volcano that erupted in 1064 CE, and Humphreys Peak, elevation 12,633feet.Again, the reciprocal angular relationship between the two pueblo sites remains,so from Walpi during the summer solstice the sun appears to rise from Canyon deChelly fifty miles away. A northeastward extension of this 65 degree lineeventually reaches a point in New Mexico near Salmon Ruin and Aztec Ruin. SalmonRuin near the San Juan River was occupied for a few generations after 1088 CE,then abandoned and reoccupied between 1225 CE and the late 1200s.The pueblo contained between 600 and 750 rooms. It also had a tower kiva builton a platform twenty feet high that was made of rock imported from thirty milesaway. Ten miles north of Salmon is Aztec Ruin (an obvious misnomer), located onthe Animas River. During its peak development it contained about 500 rooms. Likethe former, this latter site was originally inhabited in the early twelfthcentury by people of Chaco Canyon, and then re-inhabited from 1225 to 1300 CE bypeople of Mesa Verde. In addition, it has a restored Great Kiva.A winter solstice sunrise line (120 degrees azimuth) drawn from Walpi past WideRuin traverses the Zuni Pueblo (the Zuni are a tribe closely related to theHopi) and ends just south of El Morro National Monument. Inhabited from 1226 to1276 CE, Wide Ruin (or Kin-Tiel) is located about fifty miles due south ofCanyon de Chelly. It is an oval-shaped pueblo of 150–200 rooms with a number ofkivas. Atsinna pueblo, located atop a high mesa at El Morro National Monument,was a mid-thirteenth century rectangular structure, part of which was threestories in height. It had 500 to 1,000 rooms and two kivas, one circular and theother square.If during the winter solstice we stand at the rim of Tsegi Canyon (wherein theruins of Betatakin and Keet Seel are located) and sight southeast along the edgeof Black Mesa, we see the sun come up over Canyon de Chelly and Canyon delMuerto. The sun is in fact at 120 degrees azimuth on the horizon directly overAntelope House Ruin in the latter canyon. An extension of the same line into NewMexico intersects Casamero Ruin.Constructed in the mid-eleventh century, Casamero Ruin was a small thirty-roompueblo. However, its Great Kiva, one of the largest in the Southwest, wasseventy feet in diameter—even slightly more spacious than the better-known CasaRinconada at Chaco Canyon about forty-five miles to the north.From the same spot at Tsegi Canyon, also on the first day of winter, we see thesun set at 240 degrees azimuth over Grand Canyon more than eighty miles to thesouthwest. From Tsegi, a summer solstice sunrise line of 60 degrees azimuthadditionally intersects Hovenweep National Monument in southeastern Utah, wellknown for the archaeo-astronomical precision of its solstice and equinoxmarkers. Again from Tsegi, a sunset line of 300 degrees azimuth crosses BryceCanyon National Park and Paunsaugunt Plateau in southern Utah, where nearly 150small Anasazi and Fremont ruins have been identified.If we travel 112 miles almost due south of Tsegi Canyon to the ruins atHomol’ovi and look fifty miles to the northwest, the summer solstice sunsetappears 8 degrees south of Wupatki. This line (designated as “H” in the table)running between Homol’ovi and Wupatki passes between Grand Falls (an impressivecataract along the Little Colorado River) and Roden Crater (a volcanic cindercone that artist James Turrell has turned into an immense earth sculpture) tofinally end at Tusayan Ruin on the south rim of the Grand Canyon.Again, from the reciprocal village of Wupatki, the winter solstice sun rises 8degrees north of Homol’ovi. This Wupatki-Homol’ovi line (128 degrees azimuth)extending southeast passes just south of Casa Malpais Ruin and ends less thanten miles south of Gila Cliff Dwellings in New Mexico. Located in the MogollonMountains of west-central New Mexico, Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument isa ruin comprised of forty rooms in five separate caves located 150 feet abovethe canyon floor. The timbers of these structures have been tree-ring dated tothe 1280s. The late Mogollon (or Mimbres) people are known for their exquisiteblack-on-white pottery, using realistic though stylized designs. The site wasabandoned by 1400 CE.From Homol’ovi, a winter solstice sunrise line (120 degrees azimuth) falls 7degrees north of Casa Malpais and 3 degrees north of Raven Site Ruin, both northof the modern town of Springerville, Arizona. Casa Malpais is a thirteenthcentury Mogollon site of a hundred rooms with a square Great Kiva (one of thelargest in the Southwest). It also has catacombs, ceremonial rooms, threewinding stone stairways, and an astronomical observatory. Because of the natureof the artifacts found, such as crystals, ceremonial pipes, and soapstone fetishstands, it is thought to have been primarily a religious center.Located nearly ninety miles southeast of Homol’ovi and about twelve miles northof the Casa Malpais, the Raven Site (privately owned by the White MountainArchaeological Center) was occupied as early as 800–1450 CE, and had more thaneight hundred rooms and two kivas.From Homol’ovi during the winter solstice sundown (240 degrees azimuth), the sunpasses directly through East and West Sunset Mountains, the gateway to theMogollon Rim. This line from Homol’ovi proceeds past the early fourteenthcentury, thousand-room Chavez Pass Ruin on Anderson Mesa (known in Hopi asNuvakwewtaqa, “mesa wearing a snow belt”) and continues along the PalatkwapiTrail down to Verde Valley, ending near Clear Creek Ruin.If the summer solstice sunrise line (60 degrees azimuth) is extended fromHomol’ovi into New Mexico, it intersects the vicinity of Chaco Canyon, thelargest and perhaps most impressive of all the Anasazi sites in the Southwest.In the overall astral-terrestrial pattern Chaco corresponds to Sirius, thebrightest star in the heavens located in the constellation Canis Major.In this schema, each village is connected to at least one other by a solsticesunrise or sunset point on the horizon. The interrelationship provided apsychological link between one’s own village and the people in one’s “sister”village miles away. Moreover, it reinforced that the divinely orderedcoordinates of the various sky cities come down to earth. Not only hadMasau’u/Orion spoken in a geodetic language that connected the Above with theBelow, but Tawa/ Sun had also verified this configuration by his solarmeasurements along the curving rim of the tutskwa, or sacred earth.NON-SOLSTICE LINES, THE GRAND CHAKRA SYSTEM, AND THE HOPI WINTER SOLSTICECEREMONYIn addition to the solstice alignments, a number of intriguing non-solsticelines exist to corroborate the pattern as a whole. As heretofore stated, anextension of the solstice line between Oraibi and Wupatki (the belt and leftshoulder of the terrestrial Orion respectively) would ultimately end on theColorado River at the point where a major trail east toward Anasazi territorybegan. Similarly, if the non-solstice line between Walpi and Homol’ovi (the beltand the right shoulder respectively) is extended, it intersects the wrist of theconstellation and terminates within five miles of the important Hohokam ruinsite and astronomical observatory of Casa Grande Ruins National Monument, nearthe Gila River 150 miles to the south.We have also already discussed the extension of the Walpi-Canyon de Chellysolstice line (Orion’s right leg), ending up at the Salmon-Aztec ruins area. Anextension of the Oraibi-Betatakin non-solstice line (Orion’s left leg) wouldbring us to Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, nearly fifty miles to thenorth. Ruefully, hundreds or perhaps even thousands of small Anasazi ruins weresubmerged by the construction of the Glen Canyon Dam in 1963, and the few thatremain can only be reached by boat.Another alignment of ancient pueblo sites forms the grand chakra system of Orionand indicates the direction that his spiritual energy flows. Drawing a linesouthwest from Shungopavi/ Alnilam on Second Mesa, we pass less than five milessoutheast of Roden Crater and Grand Falls, both mentioned above. Continuingsouthwest, the line runs by Ridge Ruin, through Winona Village, and into theforehead of Orion—namely, Walnut Canyon National Monument, a significantmid-twelfth century Sinagua ruin located in the foothills of the San FranciscoPeaks.Occupied from 1085–1207 CE, Ridge Ruin was a thirty-room pueblo with three kivasand a Maya-style ball court. It was also the site of the so-called Magician’sBurial. Thought by Hopi elders to be of the Motswimi, or Warrior Society, thisapparently important man was interred with twenty-five whole pottery vessels andover 600 other artifacts, including shell and stone jewelry, turquoise mosaics,woven baskets, wooden wands, arrow points, and a bead cap. Winona Village, whichwas occupied at the end of the eleventh century, contained about twenty pithouses and five surface storage rooms.If the line is extended farther still, it intersects the red rock country ofSedona with its electromagnetic vortexes, passing the small but gorgeouslylocated ruin and pictograph (rock painting) site of Palatki (or “Red House”), aswell as the larger Honanki (or “Bear House”). In Verde Valley the newlyenergized vector directly transits Tuzigoot National Monument, a majorthirteenth century Sinagua ruin of over a hundred rooms perched on a hilltop forthe probable purpose of stellar observation.This line traverses the Black Hills of Arizona and goes by the newly excavatedEmilienne Ruin in Lonesome Valley, which had a foundation of twelve rooms, mostof which could have been two stories high, plus eleven outlying one-room units.The line then intersects the Fitzmaurice Ruin, located upon a ridge on the southbank of Lynx Creek in Prescott Valley. The Fitzmaurice Ruin, occupied from 1140to 1300 CE, had twenty-seven rooms in which were found beads, pendants,bracelets, and eighty-one amulets, including crystals, animal fetishes, obsidiannodules (so-called Apache Tears), and a curious six-faceted, truncated pyramidcarved from jadeite and measuring one-and-a-half centimeters wide.The line continues through the small Lynx Creek Ruin at the northern base of theBradshaw Mountains, treks across the northern limits of the Sonoran desert, andpasses near the geoglyphs on the Arizona/California border to ultimately reach apoint just north of the Colorado River’s mouth. Similar to the Nazca lines ofPeru, these geoglyphs (also called intaglios) of human, animal, and starfigures, some over a hundred feet long, were made by removing the darker,“desert-varnished” pebbles to expose the lighter soil beneath, as relayed byauthors Jefferson Reid and Stephanie Whittlesey in Archaeology of AncientArizona.According to the Mohave and Quechan tribes of the lower Colorado River region,the human figures represent the deity Mastamho, the creator of the Earth and alllife. Notice the similarity between the name of this god and that of the Hopiearth god Masau’u. These figures are thought to be between 450 and 2,000 yearsold.The same line extended in the other direction from Shungopavi travels northeastacross Black Mesa, passing just southeast of Four Corners to finally end up atthe major Anasazi sites at Mesa Verde National Park in southwestern Colorado.In this series of villages, we see a total of eleven both major and minorAnasazi or Sinagua ruins and one Hopi pueblo perfectly aligned over a distanceof more than 275 miles within the framework of the tellurian Orion. Theprobability that these were randomly distributed is highly unlikely andincreases the possibility that Masau’u (or some other divine agent) directedtheir positioning.This “ley line” forms a grand chakra system that provides an inseparable linkand a conduit of pranic earth energy flowing from the Hopi mesas to theevergreen forests of the San Francisco Peaks. More specifically, Walnut Canyonsymbolizes the terrestrial Orion’s third eye, or pineal gland, which isetymologically derived from the Latin word pinus, or “pine cone.”At this point we might ask: Why was the template of Orion placed on the Earth atthe specific angle that we find it relative to longitude? The chakra linementioned above, which runs in part from Shungopavi/Alnilam (the belt of Orion)to Walnut Canyon/ Meissa (the head of Orion), is 231 degrees azimuth in relationto Shungopavi. The direction of southwest is 225 degrees azimuth. The axis forthe terrestrial Orion is thus within 6 degrees of northeast/ southwest.Imagine we are standing at Shungopavi shortly after midnight on the wintersolstice nine centuries ago—about the time when the Hopi mesas were firstsettled. Looking southwest, we find the middle star of Orion’s Belt hoveringdirectly above the southwestern horizon at an altitude of approximately 38degrees. Specifically, at 1:15 a.m. on December 22, 1100 CE, Alnilam was at 231degrees azimuth. In other words, as we gaze from the central star of theearthbound belt of Orion toward his head located in the foothills of the SanFrancisco Peaks where the sacred katsinam live, we see the celestialconstellation precisely mirror the angle of the terrestrial configuration.Also at 1:15 a.m. on this date, Bellatrix is at 240 degrees azimuth, and Meissais at 242 degrees azimuth. Forty minutes later, Alnilam is at 240 degrees, theazimuthal degree at which the sun will set at 5:15 p.m. on this same day.Incidentally, at the winter solstice sunset time, Orion is just rising on theopposite horizon, thus emphasizing the pivotal relationship of Orion/Masau’u andthe Sun/Tawa. All astronomical computations were performed with Skyglobe (madeby the now-defunct KlassM Software).But what is the significance of this precise time when the middle star inOrion’s Belt is at 231 degrees? At the very moment we are watching this siderealspectacle, “one of the most sacred ceremonies” of the Hopi, known as the Soyal,is also taking place in the kiva, or subterranean prayer chamber. Just past hismeridian, Orion can be clearly seen through the hatchway overhead. This is thetime “when Hotomkam [Orion’s Belt] begins to hang down in the sky.”Now a powerful, barefooted figure descends the kiva ladder. White dots thatresemble stars have been painted on his arms, legs, chest, and back. He carriesa crook on which has been tied an ear of black corn—Masau’u’s maize thatsignifies the Above. One account identifies him as Muy’ingwa, the germinationdeity related to Masau’u. Another calls him “Star Man,” ostensibly because hisheaddress, made of four white corn leaves, represents a four-pointed star;perhaps Aldebaran in the Hyades.This ritually transmuted person takes a hoop covered with buckskin and begins todance. His “sun shield,” fringed with red horsehair, is about a foot in diameterwith a dozen or so eagle feathers tied to its circumference. Its lowerhemisphere is painted blue, its upper right quadrant is red, and its upper leftquadrant is yellow. Two horizontal black lines for the eyes and a small downwardpointing triangle for the mouth are painted on the lower half of this strikingface representing Tawa.Alexander Stephen, who witnessed the rite at Walpi in 1891, remarked that thestar priest stamps upon the sipapu (or a hole in the floor of the kiva thatlinks it to the underworld) as a signal to start the most important portion ofthe ceremony. This occurs just after 1:00 a.m., the time on this date in 1100 CEwhen Orion was at 231 degrees azimuth.As the dance rhythm crescendos, the “Star Man” begins to twirl the sun hoop veryfast in clockwise rotation around the inter-cardinal points between two lines ofsingers—one at the north and the other at the south. By his “mad oscillations”(to use Alexander Stephen’s phrase), the star priest is attempting to turn backthe sun from its southward journey. “All these dances, songs, and spinning ofthe sun are timed by the changing positions of the three stars, Hotomkam,overhead. Now is the time this must be done, before the sun rises and takes uphis journey.”If this were merely a solar ritual, we assume that it would take place atsunrise. On the contrary, the sidereal position of Orion must reflect theterrestrial positioning of the constellation, which occurs only after the formerhas passed its meridian, that is, “when Hotomkam begins to hang down in thesky.” Prior to dawn, runners are sent out to the shrines of both Masau’u (Orion)and Tawa (the sun) to deposit pahos (or prayer feathers), offerings to the twogods whose complex interaction helps to assure the seasons’ cyclic return,keeping the world in balance for yet another year.EGYPTIAN PARALLELS TO THE ARIZONA ORIONIn their bestseller The Orion Mystery, Robert Bauval and Adrian Gilbert havepropounded what is known as the Orion Correlation Theory. The coauthors havediscovered an ancient “unified ground plan” in which the pyramids at Giza formthe pattern of Orion’s Belt. According to their entire configuration describedjust briefly here, the Great Pyramid (Khufu) represents Alnitak, the middlepyramid (Khafre) represents Alnilam, and the slightly offset smaller pyramid(Menkaure) represents Mintaka.In addition, two ruined pyramids—one at Abu Rawash to the north and another atZawiyat Al Aryan to the south—correlate to Saiph and Bellatrix respectively.Farther south, three pyramids at Abusir correspond to the triangular head ofOrion. Bauval and Gilbert also believe that the pyramids at Dahshur—namely, theRed Pyramid and the Bent Pyramid—represent the Hyades stars of Aldebaran andEpsilon Taurus, respectively.This schema furthermore correlates Letopolis, located due west across the Nilefrom Heliopolis, with Sirius, the most brilliant star in the sky. As coauthorGilbert states in Signs in the Sky:It was Bauval’s contention that the part of the Milky Way which interested theEgyptians most was the region that runs from the star Sirius along theconstellation of Orion on up toward Taurus. This region of the sky seemed tocorrespond, in the Egyptian mind at least, to the area of the Memphitenecropolis, that is to say the span of Old Kingdom burial grounds stretchingalong the west bank of the Nile from Dashur to Giza and down to Abu Ruwash. Atthe centre of this area was Giza; this, he determined, was the earthlyequivalent of Rostau (Mead’s Rusta), the gateway to the Duat or underworld.The region in Hopi cosmology corresponding to the Duat is called Tuwanasavi(literally, “Center of the World”), located at the three Hopi mesas. Similar tothe ground-sky dualism of the three primary structures at the Giza necropolis,these natural “pyramids” closely reflect the Orion’s Belt stars. In addition,the entry to the nether realms is known in Hopi as the Sipapuni, located in theGrand Canyon. This culturally sacrosanct area mirrors the left arm of Orion.Whereas the Egyptian Rostau is coextensive with the axis mundi of the Belt starsformed by the triad of pyramids, the Hopi gateway to the underworld in GrandCanyon is adjacent to the centerplace but still close enough to be archetypallyresonant.In a later book entitled The Message of the Sphinx, Robert Bauval and coauthorGraham Hancock describe the cosmic journey of the Horus-King, or son of the sun,to the underworld: “He is now at the Gateway to Rostau and about to enter theFifth Division [Hour] of the Duat—the holy of holies of the Osirian afterworldKingdom. Moreover, he is presented with a choice of ‘two ways’ or ‘roads’ toreach Rostau: one which is on ‘land’ and the other in ‘water.’”The discussion by Bauval, Gilbert, and Hancock of the Egyptian master plan is agreat deal more complex than what is merely sketched out in this article. Theiropus involves the precession of the equinoxes, star-targeted shafts in the GreatPyramid, and other topics that are not directly relevant to our discussion.However, this compelling work has challenged many orthodox ideas in Egyptologyand spawned heated debates at both the amateur and professional levels.We have been blessed with a wealth of Egyptian hieroglyphic texts, both on stoneand on papyrus, from which we can reconstruct the Egyptian cosmology. Unless weconsider petroglyphs more as a form of linguistic communication than as rock“art,” then the Hopi and their ancestors, on the other hand, had no writtenlanguage; hence we must rely on their recently transcribed oral tradition. Inthis regard the tawa-mongwi (or “sun watcher”) Don Talayesva from Oraibi Villagedescribes an interesting parallel to Rostau.As a young man attending the Sherman School for Indians in Riverside,California, during the early years of the twentieth century, Talayesva becamedeathly ill and, in true shamanistic fashion, made a journey to the spiritworld. After a long ordeal with many bizarre, hallucinatory visions, he reachedthe top of a high mesa and paused to look. The following is his account from hisbook Sun Chief: An Autobiography of a Hopi Indian.Before me were two trails passing westward through the gap of the mountains. Onthe right was the rough narrow path, with the cactus and the coiled snakes, andfilled with miserable Two-Hearts making very slow and painful progress. On theleft was the fine, smooth highway with no person in sight, since everyone hadsped along so swiftly. I took it, passed many ruins and deserted houses, reachedthe mountain, entered a narrow valley, and crossed through the gap to the otherside. Soon I came to a great canyon where my journey seemed to end; and I stoodthere on the rim wondering what to do. Peering deep into the canyon, I sawsomething shiny winding its way like a silver thread on the bottom; and Ithought that it must be the Little Colorado River. On the walls across thecanyon were the houses of our ancestors with smoke rising from the chimneys andpeople sitting out on the roofs.In this narrative, the dry, narrow road filled with cacti and rattlesnakes,where progress is measured at just one step per year, is contrasted with theeasy, broad road quickly leading to the canyon of the Little Colorado River. Afew miles east of the confluence of this river and the Colorado River is thepreviously mentioned Sipapuni, the actual location of the Hopi “Place ofEmergence” from the Third World to the Fourth World. Physically, it is a largetravertine dome in the Grand Canyon to which annual pilgrimages are made togather ritualistic salt.In correlative terms, the Milky Way is conceptualized as the “watery road” ofthe Colorado River at the bottom of the Grand Canyon—that sacred source to whichspirits of the dead return to exist in a universe parallel to the pueblo worldthey once knew. (In an alternate conception, this stellar highway traverses theevergreen forests of the San Francisco Peaks, upon whose summit a mythical kivaleading to the underworld is located.)Talayesva’s account also includes such traditionally otherworldly motifs as the“Judgment Seat” on Mount Beautiful, which supports a great red stairway, atleast in his vision. (This peak is actually located about eight miles west ofOraibi.) We furthermore hear of a confrontation with the Lord of Death, in thiscase a threatening version of Masau’u (the Hopi equivalent of Osiris), whochases after him.Like the Egyptian journey to the Duat, the Hopi journey to Maski (literally,“House of Death”) has two roads—one on land and the other on water. In thiscontext we must decide if the latter is really a code word for the sky. In the“double-speak” of the astral-terrestrial correlation theory, are these spiritsin actuality ascending to the celestial river of the Milky Way? Is this, then,the purpose of the grand Orion schema? To draw a map on the Earth that pointsthe way to the stars?Returning to the subject of Orion projected upon the deserts of both Egypt andArizona, we find both discrepancies and parallels. In terms of distinction, theEgyptian plan is on a much smaller scale than the one incorporating the Arizonastellar cities, using tens rather than hundreds of miles. Furthermore, in theEgyptian schema the bright stars of Betelgeuse and Rigel are perplexinglyunaccounted for.The Giza terrestrial Orion from head to foot is oriented southeast to northwest,while the Arizona Orion is oriented southwest to northeast. Of course, thepyramids are located west of the Nile River, while the Hopi mesas are locatedeast of the “Nile of Arizona,” namely, the Colorado River.We should also point out that Abusir is not in the correct location to matchOrion’s head on the constellatory template. Bauval and Gilbert state that Abusiris “a kilometer or so southeast of Zawiyat al Aryan,” which is Bellatrix(Orion’s left shoulder). It is, in fact, about 3.7 miles (6 kilometers)southeast. In other words, Abusir is nearly four miles south-southeast of whereit should be according to the Orion Correlation Theory. Unlike Bauval, Gilbert,and Hancock, I have not been to Egypt, but the consultation of any scale mapwill verify this statement.Despite these few differences, the basic orientation of the Egyptian Orion issimilar to that of the Arizona Orion—that is, south, the reverse of thecelestial Orion. According to Dr. E. C. Krupp of the Griffith Observatory, thisis one factor that invalidates the Orion Correlation Theory. His critique,however, is the result of a specific cultural bias in which an observer islooking down upon a map with north at the top and the south at the bottom.Imagine, instead, that we are standing on top of the Great Pyramid—or, for thatmatter, at the southern tip of First Mesa in Arizona—and gazing southward justafter midnight on the winter solstice. The other two pyramids, or mesas, wouldbe stretching off to the southwest in a pattern that reflects the belt of Orionnow achieving culmination in the southern sky. We can further imagine that ifthe upper portion of the terrestrial Orion were simply lifted perpendicular tothe apparent plane of the earth while his feet were still planted in the sameposition—Abu Rawash and an undetermined site in the case of Egypt; Canyon deChelly and Betatakin in the case of Arizona—then this positioning wouldperfectly mirror Orion as we see it in the sky.When the Anasazi gazed into the heavens, they were not looking at an extensionof the physical world the way we perceive it today. They were instead witnessinga manifestation of the spirit world. Much like the Egyptian Duat, the Hopiunderworld encompasses both the vast reaches of the sky and the region beneaththe surface of the earth. This fact is validated by the dichotomous existence ofancestor spirits who live in the subterranean realm, but who periodically returnto their earthly villages as clouds bringing the blessing of rain.Is it simply just another coincidence that the Hopi word tu’at, also spelledtuu’awta, meaning “hallucination” or “mystical vision,” sounds so close to theEgyptian Duat—spelled by E. A. Wallis Budge, former director of antiquities atthe British Museum, as Tuat, that seemingly illusory realm of the afterlife?Even though the eastern and western domains ruled by Tawa (the sun) remainconstant, the polar directions of north and south—controlled by the Elder andYounger Warrior Twins (sons of the sun), respectively—are reversed. Therefore,the right hand holding the nodule club is in the east and the left hand holdingthe shield is in the west, similar to the star chart. The head is, however,pointing roughly southward instead of northward. This inversion is completelyconsistent with Hopi cosmology, as the terrestrial configuration isconceptualized as a reversal of the spirit world, of which the sky is merelyanother dimension. (An alternate explanation for the change in directions is thepossibility that the pole shift, which destroyed the Hopi’s Second World,reversed the position of the constellation’s mundane aspect.)Gazing up at Orion on a midwinter night, we can imagine that our perspectiveshave switched. Suspended high above the land, we stare southwest toward thesacred katsina peaks and the head of the celestial Masau’u suffused in theevergreen forests of the Milky Way. Ironically, it is here on the high desert ofArizona that we also intuit the truth of the hermetic maxim attributed to theEgyptian god Thoth (later known as Hermes Trismegistus): “As above, so below.”Let’s briefly look at one more so-called coincidence: The word zona, as in thename Arizona, is particularly significant. From classical times onward, it hasliterally been defined as “The girdle [or Belt] of Orion.”"},{"pageContent":"T H I R T E E NON THE POSSIBILITY OF INSTANTANEOUS SHIFTS OF THE POLESHAS IT OCCURRED DURING HUMAN EXISTENCE?FLAVIO BARBIEROIt is well known that the poles have often changed their position on the Earth’ssurface during past geological eras. The marks left by thick ice sheets inAfrica and India, the residual magnetism in ancient rocks, the old coral reefs’and coal deposits’ distribution and so on are compelling evidence that the poleshave wandered from what is today’s equator to the actual poles. According togeological data, this wandering should have happened in “jumps.”Scientists attribute it to the drift of continents and to the displacement oflarge quantities of materials, due to erosion and sedimentation processes, whichin theory can provoke a very slow shift of the poles: a few centimeters per yearat the most, but in hundreds of millions of years it can result in shifts ofthousands of miles.There is strong evidence, however, that this phenomenon could be much faster.In his book The Path of the Pole, Charles Hapgood expresses the hypothesis thatthe poles have changed their position three times during the past 100,000 years.Between 50,000 and 12,000 years ago, at the end of Pleistocene, the North Polewas located somewhere around Hudson Bay in eastern Canada, and it moved to itscurrent position in the twelfth millennium BCE.They were eccentric with respect to the actual poles, suggesting a differentposition for them. To support his thesis, Hapgood presents an impressivequantity of evidence, which can be summarized as follows:1. Between 50,000 and 12,000 years ago an impressive ice cap, more than twomiles thick, spread from the Hudson Bay area southward, down to the latitude ofNew York, and westward to join, at its maximum extent, glaciers flowing downfrom the Rocky Mountains in Alaska. During the same period, northern Europe wascovered by ice caps, which at their maximum extent reached the latitude ofLondon and Berlin. The quantity of water trapped in these ice sheets and in theglaciers scattered around the world was so large that the sea level was about426.5 feet (130 meters) lower than today.2. The current “scientific” explanation for the existence of these ice caps isthat they were created by a cooler climate all over the world. But this theoryis contradicted by the absence, during the ice age, of ice sheets in Siberia,which was actually populated, up to its northernmost regions, by one of the mostimpressive zoological communities of all time. Millions (more than 40 million,according to F. C. Hibben) of mammoths roamed Siberia and Alaska. Animals aslarge as this can be found today only in tropical regions, or in other areaswhere the supply of fodder is guaranteed year round.[../Images/image_17.jpg][../Images/image_18.jpg]Fig. 13.1.

The mammoth illustrated in this cave painting from Chauvet cave inFrance apparently coexisted with a large number of many other types of fauna andmega fauna, both artic and tropical, leaving scholars puzzled about the climateof the time.[../Images/image_22.jpg]Fig. 13.5. In the cave paintings of Chauvet cave, predators such as the lion areoften depicted alongside such animals as the rhino.[../Images/image_23.jpg]Fig. 13.6. The hyena and the leopard shared the same environment as camels,buffalo, giant beavers, and many other types of animals that existed during thePleistocene era.[../Images/image_24.jpg]Fig. 13.7. Horses appear in the imagery of the the Chauvet cave, a series ofchambers and vestibules all covered with masterworks breathtaking in their useof the sophisticated techniques of perspective and shading.It is counterintuitive that during the ice age one of the largest zoologicalcommunities since the dinosaurs existed in those very areas that are todayregarded, due to their extreme climatic conditions, as among the most hostile onEarth. With the mammoths there were dozens of other animal species, the majorityof which are extinct today. Of these species we have a great number ofskeletons, complete animals that have been preserved in the permafrost, and manywonderful paintings in Paleolithic caves. The oldest among the latter is ChauvetCave in France, parts of which were painted as early as 33,000 years ago. Itcontains paintings of breathtaking beauty.The unknown artists have, with a few strokes, represented to perfection animalsthat at the time were living in the plains of central Europe (and at the sametime in Siberia and Alaska)—but the beauty of the paintings makes the zoologistwonder in more ways than one. How could such a varied assembly of animalscoexist? To what bizarre ecological environment could such motley fauna belong?We find the reindeer next to the rhinoceros; the mammoth, with its woollymantle, near the hippopotamus; lions side by side with bears, leopards, andPrzewalski’s horses. There are also giant beavers and sloths, big-horned deer,camels, saber-tooth tigers, buffaloes, aurochs, and many other species.These images represent an incredible mixture that leaves us puzzled andastonished. Arctic and tropical fauna together, on the same plain, in perfectbalance with the environment! Such an extraordinarily varied and numerous animalcommunity—the likes of which can be found nowhere on Earth today—seems tochallenge current opinion on climatic conditions during the ice age. Moreover,this community suddenly disappeared when the ice age ended—exactly at the momentwhen, according to modern theories, climatic conditions were supposed to havebecome milder and more supportive of life.[../Images/image_25.jpg]Fig. 13.8. Animals that symbolized strength, such as the buffalo rendered here,are featured frequently on the cave’s walls.[../Images/image_26.jpg]Fig. 13.9. The prehistoric artworks that are displayed in the cave are sosophisticated that specialists in ice age art initially assumed that the workswere created in recent times.[../Images/image_27.jpg]Fig. 13.10. The ancient ibex was a wild goat with large, recurved horns. It wasapparently revered by the ancient peoples who painted its image on the walls ofthe cave.This mysterious, now-vanished fauna populated the Siberian islands well insidethe Arctic Sea; their remnants can be found on islands located at only 621.4miles (1,000 kilometers) from the North Pole, and rock engravings have beenfound in the same islands. This strongly suggests that in the late Pleistocene(a period during which the global climate was supposedly much colder than it istoday, especially at the high latitudes), the Arctic Sea was in fact much warmerthan it is today.3. On the other side of the world, the climate was cooler in Australia and NewZealand, back then partially covered by large glaciers—but there is solidevidence that Antarctica, now completely covered by a thick layer of ice, musthave been partially free of it at that time. Sediment cores, collected in theWeddell area, show that in the late Pleistocene large rivers must have flowed inthis part of Antarctica. Again, is this not a strong suggestion that the climateof part of Antarctica must have been much milder during the ice age than it iseven today—despite the intense global warming experienced in the past century?A shift of the poles, occurring around 11,500 years ago, could explaincompletely and coherently the climatic situation before that date, and thesituation that came into being after that date.The hypothesis that the position of the poles—as well as the inclination of theterrestrial axis in relation to the ecliptic—might change first started to gainserious consideration during the nineteenth century. Some of the greatestscientists of the time, including J. C. Maxwell and Sir George Darwin (son ofthe famous Charles Darwin), considered this problem and decided that thestabilizing effect of the equatorial bulge was so great that no conceivableforce could make the Earth shift on its axis except for a collision with anotherplanet. They therefore dismissed the idea of any shift of the poles asimpossible and, in fact, not worth discussing. Their influence has been sostrong that to this day no one has seriously contemplated such a hypothesisagain.Hapgood also uncritically accepts the assumption that only a “planetarycollision” is capable of displacing the axis of rotation. Therefore he proposesa theory that explains the shift of the poles as the result of the shift of thewhole Earth’s crust. Based on the research of the Russian scientist V. V.Beloussov, he assumes that at a depth of approximately one hundred miles in theupper mantle there is a layer of liquid rock, which behaves as a bearingallowing the whole crust to “shift” when subjected to a displacing force. InHapgood’s opinion, this force is provided by the centrifugal momentum of icecaps positioned eccentrically with respect to the poles. In this way the Earthwould keep its axis of rotation unchanged, but the poles and the whole Earth’ssurface would shift and change latitude.The evidence proving that the poles were in different positions during thePleistocene era is quite impressive, and this explains why Hapgood’s theory wasapproved by scientists of the caliber of Einstein and K. F. Mather. Yet it meetswith so many difficulties that it appears highly controversial. Above all, itdoes not seem to be compatible with other geological theories that are widelyaccepted today, notably plate tectonics and continental drift.Furthermore, the theory does not explain some of the key peculiarities of theclimate changes of the late Pleistocene—most significantly the speed with whichthese changes appear to have taken place. According to Hapgood’s theory, it tookthe North Pole at least two thousand years to move from its previous position tothe present. The evidence we have, however, supports a much faster climaticchange. It was Hapgood himself who underlined a great amount of data proving thehigh speed at which the shift of the poles appears to have happened; yet themechanism he proposes does not explain this speed.It appears that we can completely and coherently explain what took place at theend of the Pleistocene by admitting the possibility of a shift of the poles ofthe same magnitude Hapgood hypothesizes, but in a much shorter time: not morethan a few days. This possibility is generally rejected because no convincingexplanation for such a phenomenon has so far been brought forward. According toscientists, the only way to make a planet change its axis of rotation is by“adding” to it a mass comparable to its own. However, it is my view that atleast one other way exists, one that has not yet been considered—that of“reshaping” its equatorial bulges around a different axis.If Earth was a perfectly rigid and spherical body, a single man walking on itssurface could make its poles shift. In fact, the stability of the Earth isprovided only by its equatorial bulges, some 7.4 miles (12 kilometers)thick—very small with respect to the Earth’s radius. Move the equatorial bulgesand the poles will move accordingly. Impossible? Not really, if you considerthat two thirds of Earth’s surface is covered with water; every naval engineerknows that free liquid surfaces induce instability (experience shows that asimple tsunami is enough to make the poles shift by a measurable amount). Let’ssee how this instability can result in a wide and permanent shift of the poles.THE APOLLO OBJECTSSevere consequences can follow when the Earth is hit by a comet or an asteroid.We know for certain that this happened many times in the past and can happenagain at any moment in the future.If the Earth didn’t have oceans and atmosphere, its surface would be marked withhuge numbers of craters, like the moon and Mercury. On our planet, instead,erosion and sedimentary processes very quickly erase the traces of collisionswith asteroids, meteorites, and comets. Only where recent ice sheets havescraped the surface, thus uncovering the traces of ancient collisions, as inparts of Canada, is it possible to count the craters accurately. Based on thisapproach, G. W. Wetherill has estimated that in the last 600 million years ourplanet has been hit by at least 1,500 objects with a diameter larger than onekilometer each.The majority of these collisions are caused by a class of celestial bodies thatastronomers have named “Apollo objects,” a class of asteroids whose perihelionlies inside the orbit of the Earth. The first of these objects was discovered byReinmuth on 1932 and named Apollo, which gave the name to the class. At present,more than one hundred Apollos of a diameter of at least one kilometer are known.The largest discovered so far, Hephaistos, has a diameter of 6.2 miles (10kilometers). The total number of Apollo objects with a diameter of half a mile(one kilometer) or more is estimated to be between one and two thousand.As the perihelion of the Apollos lies inside the orbit of the Earth, it followsthat they periodically have the chance to collide with it. The probability ofsuch an event is estimated at 5 x 10-9 per year per single Apollo. Therefore wehave a probability of at least four collisions each million-year period withobjects as large as one kilometer or more. As the size of the objects becomessmaller, this probability grows exponentially to reach one impact every fewcenturies for objects of 328.1 to 656.2 feet (100–200 meters) diameter.The direct effects of a collision with an Apollo-like object are devastating.Author Tom Gehrels estimates that a half mile (one kilometer) wide object,colliding with the Earth at a speed of 12.4 miles (20 kilometer) per second,would liberate an energy equivalent to ten billion Hiroshima-type nuclear bombs.HOW THE POLES CAN SHIFTScientists are trying to understand what the overall effect on the Earth of acollision with an Apollo object could be. The scenarios they have come up withso far look rather dire. After all, many believe that the extinction of thedinosaurs followed an impact with an asteroid. None of these scenarios, however,has taken into consideration the possibility that such an impact could alsoprovoke an almost instantaneous shift of the poles. This is because, compared tothe Earth, a one-kilometer-wide asteroid is like a tiny sphere of twomillimeters next to a ball of 82 feet (25 meters). Its mass is absolutelynegligible. The displacement of the poles directly due to it, if any, can bemeasured in the order of centimeters.What can’t be neglected, however, is the torque provoked by the impact. Due tothe very high speed of the asteroid, the impulsive torque it delivers can be ofsufficient magnitude to overcome, for an instant, the reaction torque developedby the Earth. The torque, in itself, lasts for too short a period to produce anymeasurable effect; yet I will argue that it can trigger a process that in theend results in a change of the axis of rotation.Let’s see how.Earth is a gyro. A gyro subject to a disturbing force reacts with a movementcalled “precession.” The precession phenomenon has been studiedexhaustively—but, unfortunately, only for the case when the precession’srotation is much smaller than the gyro’s main rotation, the only interestingcase for technical applications. Scientists, therefore, are not familiar withthe case in which the two rotational components have the same order ofmagnitude. This case is examined here in the appendix, where the behavior of agyro subject to a disturbing torque of increasing value is shown. It appearsthat when the torque reaches a critical value, equal to the maximum reactiontorque that can be developed by the gyro, the latter changes its axis ofrotation permanently. The new axis, which coincides with the previousprecession’s axis, is maintained even if the disturbing torque diminishes again,as long as its value is higher than zero. Only if and when the torque iscompletely null (or becomes negative), does the gyro recover its previousrotational axis.The behavior of the Earth when subjected to a disturbing torque is obviously thesame. In fact, the Earth has a movement of precession due to the disturbingtorque exercised by the sun-moon gravitational attraction on the equatorialbulges. This torque is one million times smaller than the maximum reactiontorque that can be developed by Earth. Simple calculations, however, allow us toestablish that an object as small as a half-kilometer-wide asteroid, hitting theplanet in the right spot and at the right angle, is capable of developing animpulsive torque of the same magnitude of the maximum Earth’s reaction torque.In this case the Earth assumes, for a very short instant, a different axis ofrotation.If at the moment of the impact the force of the sun-moon gravitationalattraction on the equatorial bulge has the same direction as the force developedby the impact, a shift of the poles will inevitably follow. Immediately afterthe impact, in fact, the torque should go down to zero, and the Earth shouldrecover its previous rotational axis. But if the torque exerted by the sun-moonattraction has the same direction, the torque cannot be zeroed and therefore theEarth keeps “memory” of the impact and of its direction. This “memory” consistsof an extremely small rotational component, with the same direction as that ofthe impact, on the order of one millionth of the normal rotation.What is particular in this rotational component is that it is fixed with respectto the Earth. If the latter were a solid gyroscope, this situation would stayunchanged indefinitely. The planet, however, is not homogenous and rigid. Firstof all, it is covered by a thin layer of water, which reacts immediately to anychange of motion. Second, even the “solid” outer shell is in reality plastic andcan be easily “reshaped” by centrifugal forces.Under the effect of this tiny rotational component, seawater begins to movetoward a circle perpendicular to that rotation (the new equator). This is a verysmall effect, and if it were the only component, the resulting equatorial bulgewould be of a few feet only. But as this happens, the value of the rotationalcomponent increases at the expense of the main rotation, therefore increasingthe centrifugal force that makes more water move toward the new equator, thusincreasing the force and so on. This process starts very slowly, but acceleratesprogressively, until the centrifugal force developed by this rotationalcomponent grows strong enough to induce deformations of the Earth’s mantle.From here on, the equatorial bulge is quickly “reshaped” around the new axis ofrotation and Earth will soon be stable again, with a different axis of rotationand different poles.This mechanism shows that the Earth’s poles, contrary to what has always beenpostulated, can make “jumps” in a matter of days (that is, almostinstantaneously) of thousands of miles, due to the effects of forces at firstsight negligible, such as the impact of a medium-size asteroid and the sun-moongravitational attraction on the equatorial bulge, combined with the effects ofwater mobility and the plasticity of the crust.PHENOMENA THAT OCCUR DURING A SHIFT OF THE POLESSuppose that the Earth has been hit by an asteroid and that the conditions totrigger a shift of the poles have been met. On the basis of the adjustmentsnecessary to reshape the equatorial bulge around the new axis of rotation, andthe consequent reestablishment of the isostatic equilibrium of the crust, we canpredict what kind of phenomena would happen on the surface.Some areas of the Earth’s crust would be driven to move upward, others downward.The up and down movements necessary to reshape the bulge would be different fromsite to site. For a shift of 20 degrees, for example, the movements would beabout 2,200 to 2,600 feet (700–800 meters) at the most. Very small, compared tothe diameter of the Earth, but nonetheless of great consequence on the surface.We know that the mechanisms that maintain the isostatic equilibrium of themantle are very effective; so there is no doubt that after a while theequilibrium would be reestablished around the new axis of rotation, with polesand equator in different positions.It is important to evaluate how long it would take for this to happen. We knowthat the layers of the crust, when subjected to a force over a certain limit,break suddenly, causing an earthquake. In the situation we have hypothesized,only seawater would be displaced at the beginning, with a gradual increase ofthe speed of rotation around the new axis. When the rotational speed reaches acertain critical value, sudden adjustments of the mantle would begin to happen,and from that moment on the process would be sharply accelerated, and thereshaping of the bulge would be completed in a very short time.How short? Weeks, days, or hours? Impossible to say. A simulation with amathematical model should give reliable results. The process of reshaping theequatorial bulge should follow a course of exponential type: after the initialsharp peak, it should decrease very quickly. Adjustment phenomena, however, areexpected to continue for a long time, as the isostatic equilibrium isreestablished more and more accurately.Obviously, readjustments of the equatorial bulge of that size cannot happenwithout causing extensive fractures of the crust, which would provokeearthquakes of tremendous magnitude predictably stronger than the mostdevastating known today. A sudden burst of volcanic activity in all areassubjected to strain is also expected.The beginning of adjustments of the crust would start more than just earthquakesand volcanic activity. On the whole the oceans’ water and the atmosphere followthe rotational movement of the Earth, but they are not tied to it—if the Earthshould suddenly change the direction of its rotation, thanks to their inertia,they would keep up their previous motion at first, thus provoking a dreadfulhurricane all over the continents, with violent winds and torrential rains. Thecontinents would be swept by hurricane force winds, reaching speeds of hundredsof miles per hour. However, the attrition with the Earth’s surface would soonforce them to follow the new movement.The water of the oceans would play a much greater destructive role. We mustexpect wide fluctuation of sea level in many parts of the world, predictably inthe order of hundreds of yards.The same reasoning applies where the center of Earth is concerned, consisting ofa solid core, surrounded by a liquid layer of iron. This would at first continuein its motion, naturally undergoing strong attrition in the mantle boundaryregion that would create turbulence, which might have important effects.According to the latest theories, the liquid iron layer is the site ofelectrical currents, which are responsible for the Earth’s magnetic field. Thisturbulence could provoke perturbation in the magnetic field that might even leadto an inversion of the magnetic poles.An important element to evaluate the climatic conditions following a shift ofthe poles is the inclination (tilt) that the new axis of rotation will assumewith respect to the ecliptic. This has a tremendous effect on the climate.According to the mechanism we have spelled out so far, the axis of rotation thatthe Earth would acquire at the moment of impact should depend on the directionof the hit. However, it is impossible to predict what the actual direction ofthe new axis would be once stabilized. It is certain that it would not be thesame as the previous one, unless by fortuitous chance. Therefore, following ashift of the poles the course of the seasons would very likely be different.For example, on the hypothesis that the axis of rotation is almost vertical withrespect to the ecliptic, there would be an enormous growth of ice at highlatitudes and altitudes, with subsequent lowering of sea level. On the otherhand, the climate would be much more stable than it is today, with very limited(or nonexistent) seasonal climatic differences and an uninterrupted growth ofvegetation. This would bring about the disruption of today’s climatic barriers,with subsequent spreading of tropical species toward northern regions andvice-versa. There would also be the maximum possible development of ecologicalcommunities.This appears to be the situation that existed in the Pleistocene era, whenimposing zoological communities thrived at the very edge of the ice caps and thephenomena that put an end to this situation appear to be the same as we havedescribed.The tenth millennium BCE appears to be critical under several aspects. It wasprecisely in that period that the Paleolithic cultures, which had thrived formore then thirty millennia, all of a sudden disappeared. And all over the world,both in land and at sea, most of a megafauna that thrived for more than 100,000years declined to extinction.The Pleistocene geological era came to an end, marked by a burst of volcanismand terrible earthquakes, witnessed by the collapse of the vaults in manyEuropean and American caves, and a dreadful hurricane all over the world. Eventhe magnetic field underwent serious challenges and nearly inverted—not tomention the climate, which from then on underwent a radical change.Twelve thousand years have elapsed since then, a period that is only twice thelength of the historical period. We are the direct descendants of men whomanaged to survive those cataclysms. Is it possible that the memory of events ofthat kind has been completely canceled in such a relatively short time? Mythsand legends about an apocalyptic disaster, which marked the “beginning” ofhumankind—the “universal flood”—are common to almost all populations of theworld. Some of those legends, starting from Plato’s, report not only the samekind of phenomena we have described, but even the same date.Is this only a mere coincidence, or are they referring to the phenomena that putan end to the Pleistocene era only 12,000 years ago? If we consider that a tinyasteroid can provoke an almost instantaneous shift of the poles, the secondalternative definitely looks the most likely."},{"pageContent":"F O U R T E E NMYSTERIOUS STRANGERSNEW FINDINGS ABOUT THE FIRST AMERICANSGRAHAM HANCOCKI have consistently argued that the Americas were inhabited in prehistoric timesby a variety of different ethnic groups—Negroid, Caucasoid, and Mongoloid. Suchideas have caused deep offense to some American Indians, who have long claimedto be the only “native” Americans, and also contradict academic teachings thathold that the New World remained uninhabited by humans until the end of the lastice age, and was then settled exclusively by Mongoloid nomads from Asia whocrossed the Bering Strait about 12,000 years ago (when there was a land bridgebetween Siberia and Alaska) and made their way thence into all of North andSouth America—reaching the latter only about 9,000 years ago. Naturally, thisteaching also holds that no Caucasoids or Negroids were present anywhere in theAmericas prior to the coming of Columbus and the European conquest in thefifteenth and sixteenth centuries CE.One of the historical mysteries that drew me into writing Fingerprints was theeloquent mythical and sculptural testimony concerning a time, long ago, whenpeople who were definitely not American Indians inhabited the Americas. Both thegod Viracocha, in South America, and the god Quetzalcoatl in Mexico weredescribed as tall, white-skinned, and red-bearded—sometimes blue-eyed as well.[../Images/image_28.jpg]Fig. 14.1.

Once again, these sculptures, the so-called Olmec Heads, donot display the typical features of Native American Indians. This time they areunmistakably Negroid in appearance—depicting individuals who must have closelyresembled modern Africans, Melanesians, or Australian Aborigines.[../Images/image_31.jpg]Fig. 14.4.

I argued that realpeople must have served as the models for both types and that they shouldtherefore be taken seriously as historical testimony of the presence ofCaucasoids and Negroids in the New World more than three thousand years ago.This view was not accepted by a single orthodox scholar in 1995 whenFingerprints was first published. Since then, new evidence has come to light,which has obliged the experts to reconsider their position and step back fromthe dogma of exclusively Mongoloid settlement of the Americas. The firstbreakthroughs came in 1996 and 1997, as published in the Washingon Post, FinalEdition, Tuesday, April 15, 1997.[../Images/image_32.jpg]Fig. 14.5. Olmec Head.

Provided courtesy of Santha Faiia atwww.Graham­Hancock.com [http://www.GrahamHancock.com].Skeletons unearthed in several western states and as far east as Minnesota arechallenging traditional views that the earliest Americans all resembled today’sAsians. The skeletons’ skulls bear features similar to those of Europeans,suggesting that Caucasoid people were among the earliest humans to migrate intothe New World more than 9,000 years ago. Anthropologists have known of suchbones for years, but did not fully appreciate their significance untilre-appraising them over the last few months. The new analyses were prompted bythe discovery last summer of the newest addition to the body of evidence—theunusually complete skeleton of an apparently Caucasoid man who died about 9,300years ago near what is now Kennewick, Washington. . . . The man’s head andshoulders were mummified, preserving much of the skin in that area. . . . Thosewho examined [him at first thought that the bones] were the remains of aEuropean settler [until radiocarbon revealed their great age]. “It’s an excitingtime, and I think we’re going to see some real changes in the story about thepeopling of North America,” said Dennis Stanford, an authority at theSmithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History.Not all scholars agree that Kennewick Man was a Caucasoid. But at the very leastthe discovery has raised significant doubts about the established model of thepeopling of the Americas. Other discoveries have raised further doubts.SIMILARITIES TO MODERN-DAY ABORIGINES OR AFRICANSIn Fingerprints of the Gods, I described one of the colossal Olmec Heads of LaVenta:It was the head of an old man with a broad flat nose and thick lips. The lipswere slightly parted, exposing strong, square teeth. The expression on the facesuggested an ancient, patient wisdom, and the eyes seemed to gaze unafraid intoeternity. . . . It would be impossible, I thought, for a sculptor to invent allthe different combined characteristics of an authentic racial type. Theportrayal of an authentic combination of racial characteristics thereforestrongly implied that a human model had been used.I walked around the great head a couple of times. It was 22 feet incircumference, weighed 19.8 tons, stood almost 8 feet high, had been carved outof solid basalt, and clearly displayed an authentic combination of racialcharacteristics. Indeed, like other pieces I had seen, it unmistakably andunambiguously showed a Negro. . . . My own view is that the Olmec Heads presentus with physiologically accurate images of real individuals of Negroid stock. .. .I returned to this mystery in my book Heaven’s Mirror:Orthodox historians do not accept the presence of any Africans in the New Worldprior to the time of Columbus and have tried to sidestep the implications of theobviously African features of the three-thousand-year-old Olmec Heads—sixteen ofwhich have so far been found. It may at least be taken as a sign that there isno racism in archaeology that there are also supposed to have been no Caucasiansin the New World before Columbus! Scholars have therefore predictably raisedquibbles about the Quetzalcoatl myth of the tall bearded white man and havesought to dismiss any suggestions that it might be reflected in the numerousreliefs of Caucasian faces that have been excavated in some of the oldestarchaeological sites of Mexico. In the Olmec area, several were found in thesame strata as the African heads and sometimes side by side with them, butimages of Caucasians have also been excavated as far afield as Monte Alban inthe south-west, a site dated to between 1000 and 600 BCE.In 1996 and 1997 the discovery of Caucasian bones more than nine thousand yearsold in the Americas seems, quite suddenly, to have validated the Quetzalcoatlmyth. It is therefore now legitimate to ask how long it may be before anotherlucky turn of the archaeologist’s spade will uncover the bones of individualswho could have served as prototypes for the great Olmec Heads.That “lucky turn of the archaeologist’s spade” was not long in coming. On August22, 1999, the London Sunday Times (and, a few days later, a BBC2 televisiondocumentary) reported the discovery in Brazil and Columbia of more than fiftyskeletons and skulls of a Negroid people who had lived in South America about12,000 years ago—about 3,000 years before the first known penetration ofMongoloid peoples into this region.One particularly well-preserved example, the remains of a young girl whomscientists have nicknamed “Luzia,” has been described as “the oldest humanskeleton yet found on the American landmass.” It has been studied by WalterNeves, professor of biological anthropology at the University of Sao Paolo, whostates:When we started seeing the results, it was amazing because we realized thestatistics were not showing these people to be Mongoloid; they were showing thatthey were anything except Mongoloid. . . . They are similar to modern-dayAborigines or Africans and show no similarities at all with Mongoloids from eastAsia and modern-day Indians.The Sunday Times also quotes Richard Neave, a forensic artist with theUniversity of Manchester, who has made a reconstruction of Luzia’s face. “That,”he comments, “is a Negroid face. The proportions of the face do not say anythingabout it being Mongoloid.”Up till now, as far as I know, no scholar has pointed out that the discoveriesin Brazil and Columbia could offer an explanation for the Negroid features ofthe Olmec Heads. It’s true that the Olmec sculptures were found in stratabetween three and four thousand years old—whereas the Brazilian and Columbianskeletons are much older than that. But this does not rule out a possibleconnection. At the very least, it is surely an intriguing coincidence (a) thatpieces of monumental sculpture depicting Negroid individuals have come down tous from the prehistoric antiquity of the Americas and (b) that a Negroid people,previously unidentified and unsuspected by historians, have now beenscientifically proven to have inhabited the Americas around 12,000 years ago.Perhaps the “Olmec” Heads were not made by the “Olmecs” at all, but wereinherited by them as heirlooms, handed down from an earlier time?A CHINESE INFLUENCE?A footnote to this story, and a sign of the galloping collapse of consensusamongst orthodox scholars concerning the peopling of the Americas, is a row thatbegan to simmer in academic circles in the late 1990s concerning possiblecultural links between ancient Chinese and ancient Americancultures—specifically the Olmec and the Shang. The main proponents of this vieware Professor Mike Xu, who teaches in the foreign languages department at theUniversity of Central Oklahoma in the United States, and Chen Hanping of China’sHistorical Research Institute.According to an article published in U.S. News and World Report, and to Internetpostings, Xu believes that “the first complex culture in Mesoamerica may havecome into existence with the help of a group of Chinese who fled across the seasas refugees at the end of the Shang dynasty. The Olmec civilization arose around1200 BCE, which coincides with the time when King Wu of Zhou attacked anddefeated King Zhou, the last Shang ruler, bringing his dynasty to a close.”Xu is also reported to have “explosive” evidence in the form of archaicwritings:Over the past three years he has found some 150 glyphs on photographs of realspecimens of Olmec pottery, jade artifacts, and sculptures. As well as himselfleafing through dictionaries of ancient Chinese, he has also taken his drawingsof these markings to be examined by mainland Chinese experts in ancient writing,and most have agreed that they closely resemble the characters used in Chineseoracle bone writings and bronze inscriptions. “At first these experts all triedto send me away, saying they could not give an opinion of foreign artifacts,”Mike Xu recalls. But after his repeated entreaties, they reluctantly took alook. The moment they saw his drawings, each of them asked: “Where in China werethese inscriptions found?”When they heard they came from America, they were all dumbstruck. “If theseinscriptions had been found in excavations in China,” says Chen Hanping, aresearch associate at the mainland’s Historical Research Institute, “they wouldcertainly be regarded as symbols of the pre-Quin-dynasty period.”Reaction from other scholars has been almost universally hostile. This posting,from Constance Cook, associate professor of Chinese at Lehigh University, sumsup several key objections:Some asked me to post my observations re: the script on the Olmec Celtsidentified by Chen, Hanping as Chinese in U.S. News and World Report. I havefinally seen the article with the reproduction of the Olmec graphs and thesection that Chen believed was similar to the oracle bone script of the Shang.The graphs isolated by Chen are not Chinese. They bear some graphic similarityto some archaic Chinese graphs or parts of graphs but as single graphs equalnothing and do not have the equivalents he assigned to them. It is bogus.Obviously, the graphs/glyphs pulled out by Chen should be considered within thecontext of the entire “inscription.” This is impossible as the rest of the marksbear none but a few isolated similarities. In fact the Olmec “script” may notrepresent language at all, but like the Naxi and other urscripts, be more a codefor storytelling than an actual transcription of language. The Shang oracle bonescript, on the other hand, is very advanced and unquestionably qualifies asbelonging to a writing system.Finally, the “inscription” must be considered within the context of thesculptures. There is very little beyond the occasional face of humanrepresentation in Shang period art (some carved jade figures, but these arekneeling, often incised, and covered with animal décor, tattoos, and clothes).One famous bronze has a shaman-like figure in the mouth of an animal, but thereis no similarity to the Olmec representations.A point of correction: The U.S. News and World Report article claims that Chenis the foremost authority of only about twelve scholars worldwide who aretrained in ancient script. First, Chen is a very minor scholar. Second, thereare more than twelve scholars in the United States alone who can read Shangscript, many many more in China and elsewhere.BULGING EYES AND A LONG, CURLING NOSEI haven’t the faintest idea whether Professor Cook and the other critics areright or whether Xu and Chen are onto something with their Shang-Olmecconnection. Further open-minded research is required to settle the issue, but inthe meantime I would like to draw attention to a small piece of evidence thatSantha and I first became aware of when we visited the “Mysteries of AncientChina” exhibition at the British Museum in early January 1997 and, morerecently, when we visited Beijing’s History Museum in March 1999.[../Images/image_34.jpg]Fig. 14.7. Sanxingdui mask. Provided courtesy of Santha Faiia atwww.Graham­Hancock.com [http://www.GrahamHancock.com].[../Images/image_35.jpg]Fig. 14.8. Mayan Chac mask, architectural feature. Provided courtesy of SanthaFaiia at www.Graham­Hancock.com [http://www.GrahamHancock.com].We were intrigued by artifacts from the sacrificial pits at Sanxingdui inSichuan province, including bronzes in the shape of human heads, fragments ofgold, many jades, and a large number of elephant tusks; these artifacts werediscovered in 1986 and are the work of a previously unidentified highcivilization that flourished in Sichuan from around 1200 to 1000 BCE.Of particular interest was an exhibit described as “Mask with ornamentedforehead and protruding pupils.” It is one of three large masks that were foundin Pit Two at Sanxingdui. According to the British Museum’s commentary, found inMysteries of Ancient China:The most startling features are the pupils of the eyes, which project on stalks.. . . A further remarkable feature is the long upstanding projection rising fromthe nose of the mask. This projection is scroll-shaped, with an upright sectioncoiled at the top and with a double loop at the bottom. . . . The combination ofthe large ears, the protruding eyes and the tall quill makes this facecompletely fantastic.Is it a coincidence that almost exactly the same “fantastic” and “startling”features—bulging eyes and a long, curling projection to the nose—are found uponthe Chac masks of the ancient Maya of Central America, the successors to theOlmecs? Chac masks were sometimes also incorporated as architectural featuresinto Maya temples.[../Images/image_36.jpg][../Images/image_37.jpg]Figs. 14.9–10. Step pyramids, Xian, China.

Setting aside all other issues and anomalies, however (and there aremany), I contend that the ancient Caucasoid and Negroid skeletons that have beenfound in the New World mean that there can no longer be any room forpreconceived notions. The true history of the peopling of the Americas is likelyto turn out to be extraordinarily complex and attenuated, involving manydifferent ethnic groups and cultures in many different epochs. It does notsurprise me at all that the Chinese might have been here three thousand yearsago, or the Phoenicians at about the same time—as others have suggested—or theremarkable Jomon culture of Japan, or the Egyptians, or—much later—the Vikings.I believe it to be very likely, indeed little short of a certainty, that allthese peoples and several others as well must have independently “discovered”the Americas, in isolated individual cases, over and over again, from the veryearliest times.But how early?If we keep on pushing this inquiry back into the past—back beyond theearliest-known historical civilizations—then what, ultimately, do we come to?The possible Shang influence on Olmec writing and art takes us back 3,000 years,well within the bounds of recorded history. But Kennewick Man and Luzia take usback, respectively, 9,300 and 12,000 years, the latter date being some 7,000years earlier than Sumer and Egypt—the earliest known historicalcivilizations—and smack in the middle of the end of the last ice age, when theEarth passed through a gigantic cataclysm and floods from the melting ice sheetsscoured the globe.Some scholars have expressed the view that Luzia’s people could have come toSouth America from the Pacific and been related to Australian Aborigines.Certainly there is evidence that in ancient times the Aborigines possessedsophisticated sailing and navigational skills. So far, however, there is nohistorical theory that can explain the presence in the New World at such earlydates not only of Negroid Aborigines but also of Caucasoids—let alone the factthat memories of these conspicuous strangers appear to have been preserved inmyths and in sculptures as far afield as Bolivia and Mexico.As well as being an intriguing human and archaeological mystery, therefore, whatwe now know about the first Americans represents a radical and robust challengeto orthodox scholarship.I suspect that this story will run and run."},{"pageContent":"FOOTNOTES*1 [../Text/ch7.html#anchor_322_10] Myths are not simply fairy tales or falsestories, and in ancient times often encoded both pragmatic information andprofound knowledge.†2 [../Text/ch7.html#anchor_322_19] The precessional cycle is comprised of theAge of Aries, the Age of Pisces, the Age of Aquarius, and so on, based in theWest on the location of the sun among the zodiacal constellations on the vernalequinox.*3 [../Text/ch10.html#anchor_541_67] The Parable of the Beast, by JohnBleibtreu, published by Paladin in 1976, chapter 2.*4 [../Text/ch10.html#anchor_575_24] Alvin Plantinga is one of the leadingfigures in the Anglo-American school of analytic philosophy.
