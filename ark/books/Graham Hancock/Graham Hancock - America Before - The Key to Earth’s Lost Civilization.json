If so,I hope I can be forgiven. The years grow long and memory short!It is my wife, soul mate, and fellow adventurer, photographer Santha Faiia, towhom I owe the greatest debt. During the making of this book I suffered twoterrifying episodes of seizures and loss of consciousness, as a result of whichit is no longer responsible, or legal, for me to drive. So for all our thousandsof miles of road trips through some of the most spectacular landscapes inCalifornia, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, South Dakota, Wyoming, New Hampshire,Massachusetts, upstate New York, North and South Carolina, Louisiana,Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, Missouri, Illinois, and Ohio I was inthe passenger seat and Santha was behind the wheel. I therefore want to thank myextraordinary wife for her grit in the face of adversity, for her inspiringpresence, for her creative talent in always taking the right photograph at theright moment, and for her immense capacity for love. I would have stalled andcome to a grinding halt long ago if not for you, Santha. Thank you. Thank youfor EVERYTHING.Aside from its photographic content, this book contains large numbers ofdesigned images illustrating some of the more complex aspects of the argument.An art director was needed, and my son Luke took on this responsibility, workingaround the clock to prepare the graphics and illustrations that accompany thetext. Gratitude and respect for an excellent job well done.My research assistant, Holly Lasko Skinner, worked with me on gatheringdocumentation and tracking down hard-to-find facts from the early days of thisproject. She brilliantly sought out, churned through, and made sense ofbewildering masses of data, carefully checked all sources, and constantlyalerted me to new scientific developments. Thank you, Holly.Ross Hamilton, an inspiring teacher of the ancient mysteries, opened my eyes tothe enigma of Ohio’s Serpent Mound and helped me grasp the implications of itsnuminous connection to the summer solstice sunset.William Romain, in my opinion the most important archaeologist presentlystudying the earthwork-building cultures of the Mississippi Valley, kindly tooktime to exchange views with me and granted me permission to reproduce a numberof his excellent photographs and diagrams illustrating the archaeoastronomicalimplications of his research.Gary David, whose work on the archaeoastronomy of the Southwest is of the firstimportance, generously shared his extensive knowledge and insights with me on ajourney through Arizona and New Mexico.I’m grateful to Randall Carlson, a true comrade in arms, and to Bradley Youngand Camron Wiltshire, who all contributed to this project in different andimportant ways.Special thanks to the scientists of the Comet Research Group whosegroundbreaking Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis provides the most completeexplanation for the mysterious end of the last Ice Age and casts worldprehistory in an entirely new light. Allen West, Al Goodyear, Chris Moore, andGeorge Howard were particularly generous with their time.I’m grateful to Tom Deméré, chief paleontologist at the San Diego NaturalHistory Museum, for meeting with me and taking me behind the scenes to thearchives to share the full implications of the discoveries at the CeruttiMastodon Site. Indicative of a human presence in North America at least 130,000years ago, this is a find that rewrites prehistory.Eske Willerslev of the University of Copenhagen, a world expert in the study ofancient DNA, patiently answered my questions and shared his thoughts on theanomalous Australasian genetic signal found among certain isolated peoples ofthe Amazon rainforest.Meanwhile archaeological research of immense importance is under way across theAmazon, revealing the existence of stone circles and of hundreds of immensegeometrical earthworks. In this context I’d like to thank Mariana Petry Cabralof the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Sanna Saunaluoma, and MarttiPärssinen of the University of Helsinki, and Christopher Sean Davis of theUniversity of Illinois, for the positive spirit with which they greeted myrequest to reproduce photographs and maps illustrating their findings.For their thoroughly professional and friendly support with every aspect of ourresearch visit to Denisova Cave in Siberia, huge thanks to Sergey Kurgin, whoorganized the trip and did all the driving, and to Olga Votrina, our excellentinterpreter. Thanks and appreciation also to the Siberian Branch of theInstitute of Archaeology and Ethnography, Russian Academy of Sciences for theirkind cooperation and for their permission to reproduce photographs of artifactsfrom Denisova Cave.My editors, Peter Wolverton of St. Martin’s Press in the United States and MarkBooth of Coronet in the United Kingdom, and my literary agent, Sonia Land, ofSheil Land Associates, have been superb allies and friends, giving me thebenefit of their excellent advice and top-class professional expertise at everyturn.Any merits in America Before owe much to those named here, and to the manyscientists and vocational researchers around the world whose discoveries arereviewed in the pages that follow. I have been diligent in my attempts torepresent their work correctly, but if there are any errors ormisinterpretations, then the responsibility is entirely my own.Last but by no means least, I am blessed to be surrounded by a beautiful rainbowfamily without frontiers. Santha and Luke are mentioned here already, and now isthe moment to put on record my love and appreciation for our other five grown-upchildren—Sean, Shanti, Leila, Ravi, and Gabrielle. I’m British, born in Scotlandto an English father and a Scottish mother. I spent 4 years of my childhood inthe Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Santha is of Tamil origin but was born andbrought up in Malaysia. Sean and Leila are both half Somali and half British bybirth. Shanti and Ravi are both half Tamil Malaysian and half Italian Americanby birth. Luke and Gabrielle are both British by birth. Leila’s husband, Jason,is Greek; Ravi’s wife, Lydia, is American; Luke’s wife, Ayako, is Japanese; andthey have gifted us with three magical grandchildren, Nyla, Leo, and Henry, whobrighten our lives with their innocence, infant wisdom, and laughter."},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONI HAVE IN MY SHELVES A renowned and much respected book titled History Begins atSumer.1 [part0050.html#note1] The reference, of course, is to the famous highcivilization of the Sumerians that began to take shape in Mesopotamia—roughlymodern Iraq between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers—around 6,000 years ago.Several centuries later, ancient Egypt, the very epitome of an elegant andsophisticated civilization of antiquity, became a unified state. Before burstinginto full bloom, however, both Egypt and Sumer had long and mysteriousprehistoric backgrounds in which many of the formative ideas of their historicperiods were already present.After the Sumerians and Egyptians followed an unbroken succession of Akkadians,Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans, and there were, moreover, theincredible achievements of ancient India and ancient China. It therefore becamesecond nature for us to think of civilization as an “Old World” invention andnot to associate it with the “New World” at all.Besides, it was standard teaching in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries thatthe Americas—North, Central, and South—were among the last great landmasses onearth to be inhabited by humans, that these humans were nomadichunter-gatherers, that most of them subsequently remained hunter-gatherers, andthat nothing much of great cultural significance began to happen there untilrelatively recently.This teaching is deeply in error and as we near the end of the second decade ofthe twenty-first century, scholars are unanimous not only that it must be thrownout but also that an entirely new paradigm of the prehistory of the Americas iscalled for. Such momentous shifts in science don’t occur without good reason andthe reason in this case, very simply, is that a mass of compelling new evidencehas come to light that completely contradicts and refutes the previous paradigm.Everyone has and does their own “thing,” and my own thing, over more thanquarter of a century of travels and research, has been a quest for a lostcivilization of remote prehistory—an advanced civilization utterly destroyed atthe end of the Ice Age and somewhat akin to fabled Atlantis.Plato, in the oldest-surviving written source of the Atlantis tradition,describes it as an island “larger than Libya and Asia put together”2[part0050.html#note2] situated far to the west of Europe across the AtlanticOcean.3 [part0050.html#note3] Hitherto I’d resisted that obvious clue which Iknew had already been pursued with unconvincing results by a number ofresearchers during the past century.4 [part0050.html#note4] As the solidevidence that archaeologists had gotten America’s Ice Age prehistory badly wrongbegan to accumulate in folders on my desktop, however, and with new researchreports continuing to pour in, I couldn’t help but reflect on the significanceof the location favored by Plato. I had considered other possibilities, asreaders of my previous books know, but I had to admit that an immense islandlying far to the west of Europe across the Atlantic Ocean does sound a lot likeAmerica.I therefore decided to reopen this cold case. I would begin by gatheringtogether the most important strands of the new evidence from the Americas. Iwould set these strands in order. And then I would investigate them thoroughlyto see if there might be a big picture hidden among the details scattered acrossthousands of scientific papers in fields varying from archaeology to genetics,astronomy to climatology, agronomy to ethnology, and geology to paleontology.It was already clear that the prehistory of the Americas was going to have to berewritten; even the mainstream scientists were in general agreement on that. Butcould there be more?This book tells the story of what I found."},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00003.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00004.jpeg]The first survey map of Serpent Mound, made by Ephraim Squier and Edwin H. Davisin 1846 and published by the Smithsonian Institution in 1848, described themound as “the most extraordinary earthwork thus far discovered in the West.”"},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00005.jpeg]AN ENCHANTED REALMARCHAEOLOGY TEACHES US THAT THE vast, inviting, resource-rich continents ofNorth and South America were among the very last places on earth to have beeninhabited by human beings. Only a handful of remote islands were settled later.This is the orthodoxy, but it is crumbling under an onslaught of compelling newevidence revealed by new technologies, notably the effective sequencing ofancient DNA. The result is that many of the most fundamental “facts” of Americanarchaeology, many of the “ground truths” upon which the theories and the careersof its great men and women were built in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries,now stand exposed as fallacies.Far from being very recent, it is beginning to look as though the human presencein the Americas may be very old—perhaps more than 100,000 years older than hashitherto been believed.This greatly extended time frame, taking us back deep into the Ice Age, hasprofound implications for how we view, interpret, and date all the monuments ofthe Americas built before the time of Columbus. The possibility that they mighthave an unrecognized prehistoric backstory can no longer be discounted.Moreover, the New World was physically, genetically, and culturally separatedfrom the Old around 12,000 years ago when rising sea levels submerged the landbridge that formerly connected Siberia to Alaska.1 [part0050.html#note5] Thisseparation remained total until just 500 years ago when genetic and culturalexchanges restarted during the European conquest. It follows, therefore, thatany deep connections between the Americas and the Old World that are not theresult of recent European influence and that cannot be attributed to coincidencemust be more than 12,000 years old.It was with all this in mind, on June 17, 2017, that I made my first visit toSerpent Mound, a national historic landmark in southern Ohio described as “thefinest surviving example of a prehistoric animal effigy mound in North America,and perhaps the world.”2 [part0050.html#note6]It’s in Adams County, about 75 miles east of Cincinnati and 7 miles north of thetown of Peebles by way of SR-41N and OH-73W. With its rolling hills and greenmeadows, this is a predominantly rural, substantially forested part of thestate, running northward from the Ohio River. On that vibrant summer day everytree was in full, luxuriant leaf, every flower was in bloom, the fields glowed,and the winding lanes seemed part of a bucolic dream.In some remote epoch, however, this entire idyllic area suffered a devastatingcataclysm, the most striking remnant of which has all the features of a classicimpact crater 14 kilometers in diameter with a pronounced central uplift, sunkeninner ring-graben, transition zone, and outer rim.3 [part0050.html#note7]Millions of years of erosion have softened its contours but Google Earth or anoverflight reveal its obvious crater-like appearance. Most geologists agree thatit is the result of some kind of explosive event but the nature of the explosionfor a long while remained unsettled and there were heated arguments betweenthose who favored volcanism and those who favored an impact by an asteroid orcomet.4 [part0050.html#note8] Because Serpent Mound is the best-known featurewithin it, and because of the uncertainty caused by the dispute, the crater wastherefore officially known for many years as the “Serpent Mound CryptoexplosionStructure.”5 [part0050.html#note9] Only since the late 1990s has mountingevidence led to today’s widespread consensus that it was, as many had longsuspected, formed by a hypervelocity cosmic impact.6 [part0050.html#note10]Image Missing [../images/00006.jpeg]Variously referred to as the “Serpent Mound Crypto-Explosive Structure” and asthe “Serpent Mound Disturbance,” most scientists now agree that the bizarregeological feature within which the mound was built is an ancient impact craterwith a diameter of around 14 kilometers.As to timing, the impact was “later than Early Mississippian, because rocks ofthis age [about 345 million years old] were involved in the disturbance, andearlier than the Illinoian glaciation (125,000 years ago), because thesesediments are undisturbed in the northern part of the structure.”7[part0050.html#note11]That’s a pretty wide window! Nonetheless, most of the experts seem confidentthat the crater’s age must be in the hundreds of millions, not just hundreds ofthousands, of years.8 [part0050.html#note12] And while it’s thought unlikelythat the Native Americans who built Serpent Mound could have known anythingabout cosmic impacts, many scholars speculate that as keen observers of naturethey would certainly have noticed the curious, jumbled, cataclysmic, ringlikestructure of the area and been impressed by it.9 [part0050.html#note13]“They had to know there was a significance to that spot,” says Ohio geologistMark Baranoski. “They placed a deep reverence in old Mother Earth. It’s almostmystical that they built a spiritual site.”10 [part0050.html#note14] Similarly,geoscientist Raymond Anderson of the University of Iowa describes Serpent Moundcrater as “one of the most mysterious places in North America. The NativeAmericans found something mystical there. And they were right.”11[part0050.html#note15]Dating back to the time of the impact, an intense magnetic anomaly12[part0050.html#note16] centered on the site causes compasses to give wildlyinaccurate readings. There are also gravity anomalies caused by the impact andthere are multiple underground caverns, streams, and sinkholes that, in the viewof Ohio archaeologist William Romain, would have been seen by the ancients asentrances to the underworld: “Among many peoples, unusual or transitional areassuch as this are often considered sacred. Indeed such places are oftenconsidered supernatural gateways, or portals, between the celestial Upperworldand the Underworld. … One can only conclude that the Serpent Mound builders wereaware of at least some of the more unusual characteristics of the area and thatthey located the effigy in this anomalous area for a very specific reason.”13[part0050.html#note17]As we drove the last few miles along OH-73W, I could reflect that we wereentering the lair of the Serpent—a sacred domain where the forces of earth andsky had once collided with sufficient energy, according to the calculations ofstate geologist Michael Hansen, “To disturb more than 7 cubic miles of rock anduplift the central portion of the circular feature at least 1,000 feet above itsnormal position.”14 [part0050.html#note18]One might expect the great effigy mound to be located on the high point of thatcentral uplift, but instead it uncoils and undulates along a sinuous ridge inthe southwestern quadrant of the crater near the edge of the ring-graben. At thenorthern end of the ridge, where it takes a turn to the northwest, lies theserpent’s head.I’d seen it all in plan and maps many times before, but now, for the first time,I was about to see the real thing. I was traveling with my wife, photographerSantha Faiia, and with local geometrician and archaeoastronomer Ross Hamilton,who has devoted much of his life to the study of Serpent Mound and whose book onthe monument is a thought-provoking reference on the subject.15[part0050.html#note19]Not only here but elsewhere in the world I have noticed that very specialancient places such as Serpent Mound seem able to invoke mechanisms to protectthemselves from human folly. Among these mechanisms, from time to time, apassionate and devoted individual will be prompted by a particular site to goforth as its advocate—Maria Reiche at the Nazca Lines, for example, or KlausSchmidt at Göbekli Tepe—and ensure not only its preservation but also thedissemination of key knowledge about it.For the past decades, with absolute commitment, lean and gray-bearded andascetic as a Buddhist monk, Ross Hamilton has been that individual for SerpentMound.GROUND AND SKYWE TURN OFF 73W JUST before Brush Creek and enter a manicured park, maintainedby the Ohio History Connection. Leaving our vehicle, we follow the footpaththrough scattered stands of trees, pass the visitor center, and come after a fewmoments to a grass-covered embankment about three feet high.“The tail of the Serpent,” Ross says.I frown. It’s a bit of an anticlimax! I don’t immediately see the mystic spiralI’ve been expecting from the plans I’ve studied. But modern steps surmount theouter curve and from this vantage point the inner coils of the earthwork becomevisible.16 [part0050.html#note20]The effect remains underwhelming, largely because the present management of thesite has allowed a thick clump of trees to block the view that would otherwiseopen up to the north across the full length of the Serpent’s body from its tailto its head.To see the immense effigy as a whole, therefore, rather than in isolated parts,we need to observe it from the sky. Fortunately, Santha has come prepared forthis with a recently acquired MavicPro drone equipped with a high-resolutioncamera. She fires up the little quadcopter right away and suddenly we’re lookingdown through the monitor from an altitude of 400 feet with the Serpent beneathus, unfolding outward from that coiled tail.The site is almost deserted but there are a few people in the shot and they giveme a sense of its scale. I know it already from my background research, but tosee it with my own eyes is quite another matter. This undulating Serpent, withits gaping jaws, is 1,348 feet long.17 [part0050.html#note21] The earthworkmound that forms its body averages around 4 feet in height and tapers from awidth of about 24 feet to about 22 feet through its seven principal meandersbefore narrowing farther into the spiral of the tail.18 [part0050.html#note22]People beside it appear as midgets or elves in the shadow of a dragon and forthe first time, with a shiver down my spine, I become aware—not in my intellect,but in my heart, in my spirit—that a mighty and uncanny power slumbers here.Image Missing [../images/00007.jpeg]From an altitude of 400 feet, the full form of the great Manitou of SerpentMound becomes visible. PHOTO: SANTHA FAIIA.Ross seems to read my mind. “Some call it a Manitou,” he says. “But I’d gofurther. I’d say our Serpent is Gitché Manitou—the Great Spirit and ancestralguardian of the ancient people.”For those reared in the materialist-reductionist mind-set of Western science,the Native American notion of Manitou seems slippery and elusive. Though it maybe materialized it cannot be reduced to matter. Nor can it be weighed, measured,or counted. It is an unquantifiable, formless but sentient force, “supernatural,omnipresent and omniscient,”19 [part0050.html#note23] in one sense a spiritualentity in its own right, in another the mysterious, unseen power that animatesall life and that can manifest both in natural phenomena and in man-made objectsand structures that have been created with correct intent. “The profoundness ofa spiritual presence of Manitou, and through it recognition of thesupernatural,” comments one authority, “was and is a tangible entity seen andfelt by hundreds of generations of the Indian people of North America. … Inessence, Native people perceived a spiritual landscape imprinted on the physicallandscape as both one and the same. This ‘duality’ of the natural world stillinspires the Native population to revere as sacred certain places and rocksdeemed to possess ‘Manitou.’”20 [part0050.html#note24]THE SERPENT AND THE EGGWE BRING THE DRONE DOWN to earth for a battery change then send it back into thesky.From an altitude of 400 feet it’s notable how the sinuous natural ridge on whichSerpent Mound was built has distinct “head” and “tail” ends and how the head ofthe Serpent is placed at the “head” end of the ridge, while the undulating body,all the way back to the tail, follows the contours of the ridge exactly.Encouraged by the modern management of the site,21 [part0050.html#note25]however, the luxuriant tree cover that prohibits observation along the mainnorth–south axis also crowds the east and west sides of the body, seeming to hemin the great Manitou. A tangled mass of greenery chokes the steep western slopeof the bluff down to Brush Creek, and I note how the tree growth is particularlytall and dense to the northwest, around the Serpent’s head, as thoughintentionally allowed to flourish there to blind it.I ask Santha to point the camera at the head—which is not a work of artisticrealism but is instead a triangular geometric construct extending forward fromthe Serpent’s neck and formed of the two gaping “jaws” with a curved earthworkrunning between them.Image Missing [../images/00008.jpeg]By stripping out all trees, vegetation, and other surface features, Lidar offersviews of the Serpent Mound Manitou and the sinuous natural ridge on which itstands that cannot otherwise be seen today. LIDAR GRAPHICS BY JEFFREY WILSON.Partly within those gaping jaws sits a substantial and clearly defined ellipse.It’s a feature that Ephraim Squier and Edwin Davis, the earliest scientificsurveyors of the mound, were intrigued by. Writing in 1848, in the very firstofficial publication released by the then newly established SmithsonianInstitution, they observed that this curious structure wasformed by an embankment of earth, without any perceptible opening, four feet inheight, and … perfectly regular in outline, its transverse and conjugatediameters being one hundred and sixty and eighty feet respectively. The groundwithin the oval is slightly elevated: a small circular elevation of largestones, much burned, once existed at its centre; but they have been thrown downand scattered by some ignorant visitor, under the prevailing impression probablythat gold was hidden beneath them. The point of the hill within which thisegg-shaped figure rests, seems to have been artificially cut to conform to itsoutline, leaving a smooth platform.22 [part0050.html#note26]Squier and Davis go on to remind us that “the serpent, separate or incombination with the circle, egg, or globe, has been a predominant symbol amongmany primitive nations.”23 [part0050.html#note27] They draw our attention inparticular to the southwest of England, where Stonehenge stands, and to thenearby great henge, stone circles, and serpentine causeways of Avebury, butnonetheless decline the twin challenges of tracing “the analogies which the Ohiostructure exhibits to the serpent temples of England” and of pointing out “theextent to which the symbol was applied in America.”24 [part0050.html#note28]Almost wistfully, however, they describe such an investigation as “fraught withthe greatest interest both in respect of the light which it reflects upon theprimitive superstitions of remotely separated people, and especially upon theorigin of the American race.”25 [part0050.html#note29]Scholars in the nineteenth century, and indeed well into the early twentiethcentury, routinely applied words like “primitive” and “savage” to the works ofour ancestors. At Serpent Mound, however, as Ross Hamilton points out, theseso-called superstitious primitives were demonstrably the masters of some veryexacting scientific techniques. He gives me a penetrating look. “Just considerthe precision with which they found true north and balanced the whole effigyaround that north–south line. It was a long while before modern surveyors couldmatch it. In fact everyone got it wrong until 1987, when William Romain carriedout the first proper survey of the mound and gave us a map with correct cardinaldirections.”Connecting the hinge of the effigy’s jaws to the tip of the inner spiral of itstail, Serpent Mound’s meridian axis combines aesthetic refinement withastronomical and geodetic precision of a high order. Moreover, although theythemselves took the matter no further, Squier and Davis were right to drawcomparisons with Stonehenge and Avebury, for these great English earthworks, aswe shall see in the next chapter, both bear the imprint of the same “artisticscience.”Image Missing [../images/00009.jpeg]William Romain’s 1987 map revealed the precision of Serpent Mound’s north–southaxis."},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00010.jpeg]A JOURNEY IN TIMEJOIN ME IN A TIME machine. I’ve set it to take us back to the peak of the lastIce Age 21,000 years ago and to bring us, on a midsummer’s day, to the amazing,mysterious, and atmospheric location where the Great Serpent Mound NationalHistoric Landmark can now be found.Of course there was no “National Historic Landmark,” no such entity as theUnited States of America, and no Adams County in the very different world of21,000 years ago. At that time, from roughly the Ohio and the Missouri Riversnorthward, a wide horizontal strip of the United States, and all of Canada asfar as the Arctic Ocean, lay beneath a giant shroud of ice.At no point, however, even at the last glacial maximum 21,000 years ago, did theice ever advance quite far enough to the south to bury the sinuous natural ridgeon which Serpent Mound stands today.We’ll get to the question of when the great effigy itself was first heaped up inthe form of a serpent. But for now let’s step out of our time machine onto thatserpentine ridge and breathe the crisp fresh air under the blue midsummer skiesof an unpolluted world.We might see some of the great beasts of the North American Ice Age—the famed“megafauna,” such as mammoths, mastodons, giant sloths, short-faced bears, andsaber-toothed tigers. They thrived at the last glacial maximum and wouldcontinue to do so for several more millennia until they were all swept from theearth between roughly 12,800 and 11,600 years ago in what is known as the “LatePleistocene Extinction Event.”1 [part0050.html#note30] The creatures I’ve namedwere by no means its only casualties. All together thirty-five genera of NorthAmerican megafauna (with each genus consisting of several species) were wipedout during this enigmatic cataclysm that brought the Ice Age to an end.2[part0050.html#note31] But all that was still far in the future 21,000 yearsago, and we’re not at Serpent Mound for the megafauna. Instead I want you toshade your eyes and look to the horizon, approximately a dozen miles to yournorth. There, armored in brilliant, scintillating, dazzling reflections, aspectacle awaits you the like of which exists nowhere in the world today outsideof Antarctica. That sight, a sheer, looming, continuous cliff of ice rising morethan a mile high and extending across almost the entire width of North Americafrom the east coast to the west coast, marks the southernmost extent of the icecap in these parts. Elsewhere it stretched out its lobes and tongues a few tensof miles farther south, but here, just short of the outer rim of Serpent Moundcrater, the advance was decisively stopped.If humans had been present in Adams County 21,000 years ago to witness thephenomenon, what would they have made of it? Would they have thought this suddenhalt of the march of the ice cliffs was random? Just one of those things thathappen?Or might it have seemed that some great Manitou protected this land?Let’s get back in our time machine.I’m going to set it to stay in the same location but to jump 8,000 years forwardto a midsummer’s day 13,000 years ago, just a couple of hundred years before theonset of the Late Pleistocene Extinction Event.The first thing you’ll notice as we step out onto the ridge is that the world iswarmer—indeed it has been warming steadily since about 18,000 years ago andparticularly dramatically since 14,500 years ago. In consequence, although it isstill a giant force of nature, the ice cap has receded about 600 miles to thelatitude of Lake Superior, and those looming ice cliffs that formed a massiveartificial horizon just 12 miles north of Serpent Mound are completely gone.Minus the roads and telecommunications cables, therefore, the view thatconfronts us at midsummer 13,000 years ago is pretty much the same as the viewat midsummer today where the natural horizon encircling the effigy is formed bybroken and eroded ranges of low hills—themselves the remnants of the ancienthypervelocity cosmic impact that created this unique landscape.So, a timeline for time travelers: * 300 million years ago, or thereabouts, a giant cataclysm forms the Serpent Mound crater. * 21,000 years ago, the North American ice cap reaches the southernmost point of its advance, stopping just a few miles north of the eroded crater rim. * By 13,000 years ago the ice cliffs are gone and Serpent Mound’s natural horizon has been restored.On June 17, 2017, I made my first research visit to Serpent Mound, reported inchapter 1, and on June 20, midsummer’s eve, Santha, Ross Hamilton, and Ireturned to the site to fly the drone again and to observe sunset over theeffigy from the viewpoint of the gods.A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVEMIDSUMMER—THE SUMMER SOLSTICE—IS the longest day of the year (presently June20/21 in the Northern Hemisphere), when the sun rises at the farthest pointnorth of east and sets at the farthest point north of west on its annualjourney. It is also a particularly significant day at Serpent Mound—for it is onthe summer solstice that the open jaws of the Serpent most directly confront thesetting point of the sun, as though about to engulf it.This is because the northern end of the ridge, which Squier and Davis believedhad been terraformed (“artificially cut” as we saw in the last chapter),terminates in a pronounced turn to the west that defines the orientation of theSerpent’s head. It seems implausible, whoever they may have been and wheneverthey first conceived of the mound (open questions, as we shall see), that theancient builders were unaware that this natural westward curve aligned theleading edge of the ridge with the point of sunset on the summer solstice.Image Missing [../images/00011.jpeg]Serpent Mound alignment to the summer solstice sunset.I believe they were acutely aware of it.Indeed, the presence of the Serpent here, and the orientation of its head, bearall the hallmarks of great minds at work, manifesting a carefully thought-outdesign not meant to stand alone but rather to enhance and elucidate the solsticealignment—the sacred communion of earth and sky—that nature had already put inplace.From the perspective of twenty-first-century science, the fact that the end of anatural ridge is oriented toward the summer solstice sunset is a matter ofchance. It would be foolish to invest it with any significance—let alone with somuch significance that it could motivate a huge construction project and bringit to triumphant completion.We should keep in mind, however, that matters seemed very different to theancients, who perceived the earth and sky as living spirits in communion withone another.In our century, when technology is king and the majority of the human race liveand die in cities, we cut down rainforests, pollute and defile the earth, andshun and scrape the sky. Serried blades of immense buildings dice our view ofthe horizon into jagged, glittering, meaningless origami, while light pollutionis so intense that we cannot see the stars. Ironically, however, any number ofastronomy programs will bring those stars flickering into virtual reality on ourcomputer screens. Ironically, too, ours is a culture that has advanced thescientific study of the cosmos to an exceptionally high degree.It seems we want to see everything, but only at a distance, through atechnological filter.Little wonder, therefore, that, for so many of us, the sky has entirely lost thenuminous aura that once clung about it, and has been reduced to a vague,out-of-focus, largely irrelevant, not even beautiful background to the much moreimportant material business of our daily lives. Reared in a culture that focusesall its energies on the production and consumption of commercial goods andservices, it just looks to us like bad business to commit huge resources,intelligence, and energy to building great monuments aligned—for example—to therising or setting points of the sun on the equinoxes or on the summer or wintersolstices.Yet for thousands upon thousands of years this is exactly what happened allaround the world.WHERE HEAVEN AND EARTH MEETGO TO THE CITY OF Luxor in Upper Egypt, place yourself at the western entranceof the great Temple of Karnak in the predawn on December 20/21 (the wintersolstice and shortest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere), and waitpatiently until the sun appears. When it does you will see that its first raysshine directly down the kilometer-long axis of the temple that is oriented southof east at precisely the correct angle to target the rising point of the sun onthat special day.Or go to Stonehenge in the predawn on June 20/21, the summer solstice, enter thegreat stone circle, and face north of east along its axis toward a rough,unquarried megalith—the Heel Stone—standing prominently outside the circle. Aslight floods the sky you will see how carefully and purposefully the Heel Stoneseems to have been placed, almost like the front sight on the barrel of a rifle,to target the rising sun on that special day.Or go to Angkor Wat in Cambodia and position yourself dead center at the westernend of the entrance causeway of the great temple complex in the predawn on March20/21, the spring equinox, or on September 20/21, the autumn equinox, when nightand day are of equal length and the sun rises perfectly due east. On either ofthese two special occasions you will discover that the causeway and temple areso precisely oriented that the sun, as it rises, perches for a moment atopAngkor’s central tower and lights up the entire majestic complex like afairy-tale kingdom.All these places are man-made sanctuaries that speak to the union of heaven andearth at key moments of the year. They might rightly be described ashierophanies because their fundamental purpose is to reveal and manifest thesacred connection between macrocosm and microcosm, sky and ground, “above” and“below.”Scattered around this majestic garden planet we call Earth, however, are other,even more powerful hierophanies, put in place not by human beings but by nature,where ground and sky whisper to one another with exceptional intimacy. Wiseancients, who knew the garden long before us, sought out such spots, which theyheld to be sacred, and when they found them they would sometimes modify them tohonor and enhance the communion witnessed there.Research published in 2018, though subject to further confirmation, suggeststhat Stonehenge may be one of them. Archaeologists have long believed that itstaller, heftier pillars—the big limestone “sarsens”—did not occur locally onSalisbury Plain where Stonehenge stands but had to be dragged 18 miles from theMarlborough Downs.3 [part0050.html#note32] The enduring mystery, therefore, was,why anyone would go through all that trouble and effort moving megalithsweighing up to 50 tons to Salisbury Plain when Stonehenge could simply have beenerected on the Marlborough Downs instead?The new research offers a rather surprising answer. It seems that two of thesarsens—Stone 16 in the southwestern quadrant of the great circle, and the HeelStone outside the circle to its northeast—were NOT after all brought here fromthe Marlborough Downs but have stood naturally on Salisbury Plain for millionsof years.4 [part0050.html#note33] What’s magical about them, however, is theiralignment. An observer behind Stone 16 looking northeast toward the Heel Stoneat dawn on the summer solstice will see the sun rise behind it. Then 6 monthslater, at the winter solstice, an observer behind the Heel Stone lookingsouthwest at Stone 16 will see the sun set behind it.Image Missing [../images/00012.jpeg]New research indicates that Stone 16 and the Heel Stone were present onSalisbury Plain, aligned by nature to the solstices, before Stonehenge wasbuilt. IMAGE: DERIVATIVE OF “STONEHENGE” BY RUSLANS3D, CC BY 4.0.Archaeologist Mike Pitts, who led the research, suggests that the way thealignment of these two sarsens signaled midwinter and midsummer would not havegone unnoticed by the ancient Britons, who would have accorded specialsignificance to the site long before they planned the geometry of Stonehenge andraised up the whole spectacular complex of megaliths around the preexistingaxis. Indeed, if Pitts is right, it is because of this natural solstice axisthat Stonehenge was built here in the first place.5 [part0050.html#note34]Another example of humans sacralizing a place where earth speaks to sky is theGreat Sphinx of Giza in Egypt, which is thought to have begun life as a“yardang”—a ridge of bedrock shaped by millennia of desert winds into acompletely natural form somewhat resembling a lion.6 [part0050.html#note35] Manysuch outcrops, described by European explorers of the eighteenth and nineteenthcenturies as “sphinxlike” and as resembling “lions,” exist in Egypt’s WesternDesert.7 [part0050.html#note36] But what was special about this one was itssituation overlooking the Nile Valley and the curious fact that nature hadoriented it, with considerable precision, to due east and thus to the risingpoint of the sun on the equinoxes. As suggested at Stonehenge, it looks likethis celestial alignment is what attracted human beings to it in the firstplace, motivating them to transform it into a giant monolithic work ofsculpture, first enhancing its naturally leonine form and much later, in thetime of the pharaohs, recarving its (by then heavily eroded) leonine head into ahuman likeness.Go to Giza at dawn on the winter solstice and you will see the sun rising far tothe south of east, and thus far to the right of the gaze of the Sphinx. Go thereat dawn on the summer solstice and you will see the sun rising far to the northof east, and thus far to the left of the gaze of the Sphinx. But go there atdawn on either the spring or the autumn equinox and you will witness the sacredcommunion of heaven and earth, with the gaze of the Sphinx perfectly aligned tothe disk of the sun as it rises.Such enchanted but fleeting conjunctions of earth and sky are not confined tothe Old World.In the New World, Native Americans likewise built immense structures to honorand channel precisely the same moments and energies and sought out certainstriking topographical features—regarded as sacred—through which the celestialand terrestrial spirits were already bound in intimacy. Thus, just as Egypt hasits Great Sphinx, natural but modified and enhanced by humans to bind sky andground at sunrise on the equinoxes, and just as the natural solstitial axis ofStonehenge has been modified and enhanced by humans with numinous and beautifuleffect, so North America has its Great Serpent Mound, a natural ridge, modifiedand enhanced by humans to join heaven and earth at sunset on the summersolstice.Image Missing [../images/00013.jpeg]In their 1987 paper the Hardmans proposed a viewpoint near the center of theoval formation in front of the Serpent’s head where an altar of large stones wasreported to have remained in place until it was destroyed in the nineteenthcentury. From this viewpoint they settled on an alignment at azimuth 302 degreestargeting sunset on the summer solstice.HERE COMES THE SUNSERPENT MOUND’S STRIKING CONNECTION TO the summer solstice went unnoticed,unobserved, and unstudied by anyone in our era until 1987. That was the year inwhich the fall issue of the Ohio Archaeologist published a landmark paper byClarke and Marjorie Hardman titled “The Great Serpent and the Sun.”In this paper, the ridge behind which the sun sets on June 20/21 as viewed fromSerpent Mound was daringly renamed “Solstice Ridge” by the authors, and theorientation of the open jaws of the Serpent to the setting point of the sun onthe summer solstice was recognized and made explicit for the first time.8[part0050.html#note37]What has been seen cannot be unseen, even in an age so radically disconnectedfrom the cosmos as our own. Thanks to the Hardmans, therefore, no one who takesa serious look at Serpent Mound can now fail to observe the way the Serpent’sjaws line up to the setting summer solstice sun. Because those jaws gape wide,however, it’s an alignment that would have been as general and obvious 13,000years ago as it is today. The Hardmans therefore sought to refine it. As shownin the diagram above, they selected as their viewpoint the reported location,near the center of the oval formation in front of the Serpent’s head, of theformer “elevation of large stones” described by Squier and Davis as destroyedwhen they visited the site in the mid-nineteenth century.9[part0050.html#note38] The Hardmans argued that an observer who positionedhimself in this location on the evening of the summer solstice would see the sunset at an azimuth of 302 degrees behind a specific feature on “Solstice Ridge”—afeature something like the front sight on a rifle that they nominated “SolsticeKnob.”10 [part0050.html#note39]Image Missing [../images/00014.jpeg]The “azimuth” of an object is its distance from true north in degrees countingclockwise. North is nominated as 0 degrees, so azimuth 90 degrees is due east,azimuth 180 degrees is due south, and azimuth 270 degrees is due west. Anazimuth of 302 degrees will therefore be 32 degrees north of west.ROASTING THE HARDMANSIT’S OFTEN THE CASE IN archaeological scholarship, and actually good science,that whenever an adventurous and unusual new thesis is published attempts willbe made to falsify it. It was therefore only to be expected, as I turned to thewinter 1987 issue of Ohio Archaeologist, that I would find a refutation of theHardmans’ work. Titled “Serpent Mound Revisited,” the paper was written byWilliam F. Romain, a very interesting and important researcher in this field.On the assumption that Serpent Mound had been built around 2,000 years ago (theconsensus archaeological opinion in the 1980s) Romain pointed out that theHardmans proposed alignment had failed to take into account a well-establishedarchaeoastronomical phenomenon, namely that the sun’s rising and setting pointsalong the horizon do not remain fixed but slowly change down the ages.11[part0050.html#note40]This happens because sunrise and sunset positions are constrained not only bythe latitude from which they are observed, but also by the tilt of the earth’saxis in relation to the plane of its orbit. Presently the angle of the tiltstands at around 23° 44'.12 [part0050.html#note41] This angle, however, is notfixed but slowly increases and decreases in a 41,000-year “obliquity cycle”between a minimum of 22.1° and a maximum of 24.5°.13 [part0050.html#note42] Theresulting changes to sunrise and sunset positions along the horizon over longperiods are “sizable,” according to leading archaeoastronomer Anthony F.Aveni,14 [part0050.html#note43] whose calculations Romain used in his 1987 paperto highlight what he believed was the fatal flaw in the Hardmans’ case. They hadaccepted the epoch of 2,000 years ago for the construction of Serpent Mound, buttheir proposed sunset azimuth of 302° made no sense. Viewed from Serpent Mound2,000 years ago, as Romain correctly pointed out, “the summer solstice sun wouldhave set at an azimuth of about 300.4 degrees. … In other words, the summersolstice sun would have set roughly 1.6 degrees, the equivalent of 3 sundiameters, south of Solstice Knob.”15 [part0050.html#note44] If Serpent Moundreally was that far out of alignment 2,000 years ago when it was supposed tohave been built, then only four logical conclusions presented themselves: (1)its builders were very poor astronomers; (2) they hadn’t intended to orient themonument to the summer solstice sunset at all; (3) the Hardmans were right intheir general thesis but had gotten the proposed observation point and sightline wrong; or (4) The alignment had not been made 2,000 years ago but at acompletely different time.In another paper, published in Ohio Archaeologist a year later, Robert Fletcherand Terry Cameron picked up where Romain had left off in a renewed roasting ofthe Hardmans. Noting that the summer solstice sun as viewed from Serpent Moundcurrently sets at azimuth 300° 05', and noting the effects of the obliquitycycle, they treat with sarcasm the Hardmans’ claim that the Serpent’s primaryorientation was to azimuth 302°: “If a horizon marker at 302 degrees was used atone time to mark the summer solstice sunset position, the Serpent, byimplication, must have been constructed around 11,000 BC. There may be some whowould have problems with that date.”16 [part0050.html#note45]It’s the last line that reveals the scorn.You bet there would have been “some” in 1988 who would have had problems withthat date! Indeed, not just some but all archaeologists would have regarded itas the province of the lunatic fringe to suggest that Serpent Mound might in anyway go back as far as 11,000 BC, that is, to around 13,000 years ago.In the 1980s, as we’ll see in part 2, there was a general acceptance that humansmight have first arrived in the Americas by 12,000 or even 13,000 years ago. Butthose earliest migrants were deemed by archaeologists to have been scatteredhunter-gatherer groups, living from hand to mouth and lacking the vision,sophistication, and level of organization required to create a monument on thescale of Serpent Mound.Image Missing [../images/00015.jpeg]William Romain’s summer solstice sunset alignment for Serpent Mound alongazimuth 300.1 degrees. This alignment would have targeted the summer solsticesunset 2,000 years ago and differs by 1.9 degrees from the alignment proposed bythe Hardmans.The real implication of the Hardmans’ “error”—the clue they’d inadvertentlystumbled upon, of possibly much more ancient origins for the site—was thereforenever followed up because the prevailing theory of the peopling of the Americaswould not admit it as evidence.Meanwhile, as the years passed, William Romain changed his mind. In 1987 he hadwritten in his critique of the Hardmans that the orientation of Serpent Moundcould be “better explained by a set of facts having nothing to do with thesummer solstice.”17 [part0050.html#note46] By the year 2000, however, he wasready to accept as “unequivocal” an alignment from the head of the Serpent“through the oval embankment to the summer solstice sunset,”18[part0050.html#note47] and showed in a map how this could be done to targetazimuth 300.4 degrees, later revised to azimuth 300.1 degrees (personalcommunication October 31, 2018), where the summer solstice sun would have set2,000 years ago.19 [part0050.html#note48] He also reiterated the definitivenorth–south line he’d identified in 1987 running through the monument from theinner spiral of its tail to the hinge of its jaws.20 [part0050.html#note49]BUT IS THE SERPENT REALLY 2,000 YEARS OLD?BACK IN THE 1980S, WHEN Romain first laid into the Hardmans, the one thing bothsides agreed on was that Serpent Mound was about 2,000 years old and was one ofthe later works of “the Adena,” a Native American culture thought to haveflourished between approximately 800 BC and AD 100.21 [part0050.html#note50]Though no carbon dating had been done, this was the consensus view of almost allexperts at the time, and Romain and the Hardmans not only accepted it withoutquestion but also used it as the basis for their own calculations of alignments.Imagine their surprise, therefore, when Robert Fletcher of the University ofPittsburgh (one of the early critics of the Hardmans), William Pickard of OhioState University, and Bradley T. Lepper of the Ohio Historical Society carriedout the first carbon-dating of Serpent Mound and found it to be much youngerthan everyone had supposed—not 2,000 years old or more, but 1,000 years old orless.22 [part0050.html#note51] To be precise, they concluded that the mostlikely date for its construction was 920 years (plus or minus 70 years) beforethe present,23 [part0050.html#note52] and that it must therefore be the work ofthe so-called Fort Ancient culture thought to have flourished at around thattime.24 [part0050.html#note53]Published in spring 1996 in a respected peer-reviewed journal, this notion of amuch younger Serpent Mound went on to enjoy a level of widespread acceptanceamong American archaeologists that would certainly not have been accorded to itif the redating had gone in the other direction. Moreover, after being quicklyand uncritically adopted into doctrine,25 [part0050.html#note54] it was thendisseminated to the public for most of the next 20 years as unquestionedhistorical fact.26 [part0050.html#note55]As part of this process, an Orwellian scene took place at Serpent Mound in 2003when the official Ohio historical marker that had previously attributed themonument to the Adena culture was “unhappened” and replaced by another in whichvisitors were informed that the earthwork had been built “around 1000 A.D. bythe Fort Ancient culture.”27 [part0050.html#note56]Let’s take a look at the evidence on which Fletcher, Pickard, and Lepper basedthe 1996 claim that so effectively redefined Serpent Mound.Part of it has to do with an absence of evidence of typical Adena culturalartifacts—indeed an absence of any artifacts—in those parts of the Serpentexcavated prior to the 1990s.28 [part0050.html#note57] As Fletcher & Co. rightlypoint out, it was only because a number of “definite Adena burial mounds” hadbeen found nearby that Serpent Mound had been attributed to the Adena in thefirst place—an attribution that was therefore “somewhat tenuous.”29[part0050.html#note58]As to the positive evidence for their claim, Fletcher & Co. give specialprominence to stone flakes and tools uncovered by their excavations at SerpentMound, including “a classic Fort Ancient Madison point.”30[part0050.html#note59] They also recovered twenty-nine pottery shards“assignable to some period between A.D. 350 and 950.”31 [part0050.html#note60]Finally—and clearly the clincher as far as they’re concerned—they list theradiocarbon dates for three samples of charcoal retrieved during theirexcavations.One, with a date of 2920 plus or minus 65 years before the present, theyimmediately dismiss because it came from a level “far below the estimatedoriginal surface upon which Serpent Mound was built.”32 [part0050.html#note61]But the other two they like. Both were recovered from the “intact sediment usedto create the effigy,” and both returned the same calibrated radiocarbon date ofAD 1070.33 [part0050.html#note62]These two identical dates, Fletcher, Pickard, and Lepper conclude, “Representvalid chronological evidence for the construction of Serpent Mound sometimeduring the Late Prehistoric or Early Fort Ancient periods.”34[part0050.html#note63]Lepper even speculates (he does admit it’s speculation)35 [part0050.html#note64]that the Serpent was made in response to the passage of Halley’s Comet in1066—recorded elsewhere as far afield as Europe and China: “It was aspectacular, fiery display. And it seems to me it’s more than possible that theNative Americans may have viewed Halley’s comet as a serpent snaking across thesky. It’s possible they looked up at it and recorded it as an omen and built theserpent.”36 [part0050.html#note65]And that’s it! With a wave of the archaeologist’s magic wand, a fairy-talecastle of speculation is conjured into being on the foundations of just two tinyfragments of charcoal. In the process, while being rendered less old, lessvenerable, and less mysterious, the sublime artistry, astronomy, geometry, andimagination expressed in Serpent Mound are snatched from one culture and handedto another by the so-called experts of a third!SKIN CHANGERNORTH AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY HAS A long track record of wanting Native Americansites to be young, as we’ll see in part 2. In the case of Serpent Mound,however, there were some archaeologists, notable among them William Romain, whowere never happy with the “somewhat tenuous” nature of the evidence on whichFletcher, Pickard, and Lepper had built their castle in the sky. As Romaintactfully put it in 2011, “Since the charcoal that was dated did not come from afoundation feature or event, the A.D. 1070 date may not reflect when the effigywas actually constructed.”37 [part0050.html#note66]Soon afterward Romain followed up his hunch by joining forces with amultidisciplinary team of fellow researchers “to re-evaluate when and howSerpent Mound was built.”38 [part0050.html#note67] It was a thorough,professional, long-term project deploying the latest technologies and involvingfresh excavations, core sampling, and multiple radiocarbon dates. The results,published in the Journal of Archaeological Science in October 2014, thoroughlyripped the rug out from under the comfortable consensus of the previous 18 yearsthat the Serpent was around 900 or 1,000 years old and was the work of the FortAncient culture.“We believe that taken as a whole,” Romain and his colleagues reported, “ourdata strongly support that Serpent Mound was first constructed ~2300 years ago,rather than ~1400 years later. Our results indicate the presence of apre-construction paleosol beneath Serpent Mound, and that charcoal fromdifferent locales along its surface dates consistently to ~300 BC. The youngestcalibrated age within the 95% probability range is 116 BC and we obtained nodates associated with the later Fort Ancient occupation of the site.”39[part0050.html#note68]Charitably, however, there was no crowing in triumph, no pouring of scorn onFletcher, Lepper, and Pickard. Instead Romain’s team saw the real answer in acompromise:The evidence compiled by Fletcher et al. concerning the reliability of theirC-14 ages is generally convincing and supports the charcoal as authenticallyrelated to a Fort Ancient (re)construction episode 900 years ago, which leavesthe contradiction between the two initial construction chronologies unresolved.To settle this contradiction, we propose that Serpent Mound was constructed andthen later modified during two distinct episodes: an Adena construction ~2300years ago during which the mound was first built, followed ~1400 years later byan episode of Fort Ancient renovation or repair.40 [part0050.html#note69]Because their work was well done, their evidence solid, and their argumentscompelling, but also because their “redating” was more of a return to thepre-1996 consensus than anything dangerously new or radical, the model proposedby Romain and his colleagues has subsequently displaced Fletcher et al. SerpentMound has been returned to the Adena and, despite some unpersuasive protestsfrom Bradley Lepper41 [part0050.html#note70] and incomplete information foistedon the public at the site itself, few today would seriously attempt to arguethat it is less than 2,300 years old.The lingering question, though, is, could it be older?Perhaps very much older?After all, is it not the defining quality of the serpent that from time to timeit sheds its skin? And is it not precisely on account of this that it served formany ancient cultures as a symbol of reincarnation?42 [part0050.html#note71] Itis therefore reasonable to ask how often Serpent Mound has shed its skin andrenewed itself.Image Missing [../images/00016.jpeg]This noticeboard, which remained in place at the site in 2018, underinforms thepublic by making Serpent Mound more than 1,000 years younger than the mostaccurate carbon dates suggest. PHOTO: ROSS HAMILTON.The 1996 and the 2014 studies, taken together, provide solid evidence of achange of skin around 900 years ago—a “renovation” project. However, largelybecause of the “pre-construction paleosol” (soil stratum laid down in an earlierage) forming the foundation of the mound,43 [part0050.html#note72] it is takenfor granted that the earlier episode at 2,300 years ago was the birth of theproject. Setting aside the one anomalous charcoal fragment, dated to 2,920 yearsago in the 1996 study, and the two fragments testifying to the Fort Ancientrenovation, all the datable materials from the 2014 study, which clusteredaround 300 BC as we’ve seen, were found above this bed of ancient soil. “Thesub-mound paleosol was buried,” the archaeologists therefore conclude, “andSerpent Mound construction began … 2300 years ago during the Early Woodland(Adena) Period.”44 [part0050.html#note73]It seems like a reasonable argument but it leaves another possibilityunconsidered—namely that 2,300 years ago Serpent Mound was already an enormouslyancient structure, perhaps very much eroded and damaged, and that it was cleareddown to the level of the paleosol and remade by the Adena culture at this time.In that case the archaeologists behind the 2014 study would not have documentedthe birth of the Serpent but its rebirth—or reincarnation.Why not?The 2014 study did not gather the necessary data to confirm whether the moundwas in continuous use from the Adena period 2,300 years ago until the FortAncient renovations 1,400 years later: “However, a possible erased coil near thehead of the serpent indicates that other alterations, potentially severalhundred years earlier than the Fort Ancient repairs, may also have occurred.This suggests a deeper, richer, and far more complex history for Serpent Moundthan previously known.”45 [part0050.html#note74]Again—why should this deeper, richer, far more complex history be limited to therelatively recent past? Since Romain and his coauthors are prepared to considerthe possibility that Serpent Mound “was regularly used, repaired, and possiblyreconfigured by local groups for more than 2000 years,”46 [part0050.html#note75]then why not for longer?Even Fletcher & Co. admit that their anomalous 2,920-year-old piece of charcoal,and nearby Adena burial mounds, are evidence of “the use of the area during theEarly Woodland Period.”47 [part0050.html#note76] But why should such use havebeen “ephemeral,” as they assert?48 [part0050.html#note77] Why shouldn’t thoseEarly Woodland peoples also, like later cultures, have been present to tend to,maintain, restore, and sometimes reorient and reconstruct the great Manitou?If so, and if others who came before them had done the same work in their time,inheriting that sacred responsibility from even earlier cultures andparticipating down the millennia in an irregular process of restoration andrefurbishment, then the possibility cannot be ruled out that the firstincarnation of the effigy might indeed have been in the Ice Age 13,000 yearsago. Were that to be confirmed, everything we’ve been taught about the state ofearly Native American civilizations and the global timeline of prehistory wouldhave to be rethought."},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00017.jpeg]THE DRAGON AND THE SUNIN 2017 THE CLOSEST SUNSET to the precise astronomical moment of the summersolstice occurs on the evening of June 20—which is why Santha, Ross Hamilton,and I are back at Serpent Mound on that day rather than on the 21st, when thesolstice is more often celebrated. Angles, calculations, and astronomicalsoftware are all very well, but nothing beats direct, on-the-spot observation.Our project on the 20th, therefore, having familiarized ourselves with the siteand its surroundings on our first visit on the 17th, is for Santha to fly thedrone 400 feet above the great effigy, and photograph it at sunset from a pointoverlooking both its head and the horizon, commanding its field of view, so thatwe can see for ourselves what its alignment is really all about.It’s around 3 pm and the sky is cloudless, giving us hope of a clear horizonthis evening. With more than enough time to spare on what, after all, is thelongest day of the year, Ross beckons for us to follow him on a steep, windingpath that leads down from behind the coiled tail of the Serpent through densewoods to the base of the ridge on which the great effigy stands. It’s such acalm, clear, peaceful afternoon, filled with the sweet notes of birdsong and sopoignant a dance of light and shadow between the leaves and the sun that thethree of us fall silent, descending slowly and steadily, just breathing it allin. The path levels out along the bank of Brush Creek and we follow it towardthe northwest. The creek is on our left and the ridge looms 100 feet above us onour right. Its slope is not entirely overgrown. In places it is sheer, almost acliff, on which the trees and bushes can get no purchase and the bare limestonebedrock is exposed.Image Missing [../images/00018.jpeg]As we walk Ross goes over the implications of his own investigations into thetrue age of Serpent Mound. I refer the reader to his masterwork, The Mystery ofthe Serpent Mound, for full details.1 [part0050.html#note78] In brief, though,his view as to when exactly the effigy was first constructed is not derived fromany of the radiocarbon assays, or from calculations to do with the azimuth ofthe summer solstice sunset. Instead he focuses on the form of the serpent, whichhe perceives as a terrestrial image of the constellation Draco.Image Missing [../images/00019.jpeg]In images from many cultures, Draco is depicted as a serpent.I have my own history with Draco, as those who have followed my work over theyears will know. In my 1998 book Heaven’s Mirror, for example, I presentevidence that this enormous constellation, widely depicted as a serpent by manyancient cultures,2 [part0050.html#note79] served as the celestial blueprintaccording to which the temples of Angkor in Cambodia were laid out on theground—with each temple “below” matching a star “above.” The essence of my caseis that the notion of “as above so below” expressed in the architecture ofAngkor is part of an ancient globally distributed doctrine—or “system”—that setout quite deliberately to create monuments on the ground, all around the world,to mimic the patterns of certain significant constellations in the sky.Moreover, since the positions of all stars as viewed from earth change slowlybut continuously due to the phenomenon called “precession,” it is possible touse particular configurations of astronomically aligned monuments to deduce thedates that they represent—that is, the dates when the stars were last in thecelestial locations depicted by the monuments on the ground.Image Missing [../images/00020.jpeg]The constellation of Draco overlaid on Serpent Mound. The neighboringconstellation is Ursa Minor, the Little Bear, which houses our present polestar, Polaris. LEFT: The accuracy of Romain’s 1987 survey is demonstrated by themany-starred asterism of Draconis. Each point of light is given equal size inorder to demonstrate the accuracy of the original designer’s vision (Hamilton1997, after Cambridge and Romain). RIGHT: The ancient north star Thuban, whichpreceded the present pole star Polaris (the dot touching the outside of thecircle), is used as the center of this geometry. Both ends of the Serpent areequal in distance from the center point, Thuban (Hamilton 1997, after Romain).This process of constant change unfolds, of course, over a great cycle of 25,920years and has nothing to do with the motions of the stars, or with the obliquitycycle. Its cause is another quite different motion of the earth driven by thecontradictory pull of the gravity of the sun and the moon. The result is a slowcircular wobble of the planet’s axis of rotation, at the rate of one degreeevery 72 years, much resembling the wobble of a spinning top that is no longerupright. The earth is the viewing platform from which we observe the stars, sothese changes in orientation cause changes in the positions of all stars asviewed from earth.To envisage the process, picture the earth’s axis passing through thegeographical south and north poles and thence extended into the heavens. Thesouth and north pole stars in any epoch are the stars at which the two “tips” ofthis extended axis point most directly.Serpent Mound is in the Northern Hemisphere and the north celestial pole ispresently occupied by our “pole star” Polaris (Alpha Ursae Minoris, in theconstellation of the Little Bear). The effect of precession, however, is tocause the tip of the axis to inscribe an immense circle in the heavens over thecycle of 25,920 years. Thus around 3000 BC, just before the start of the PyramidAge in Egypt, the pole star was Thuban (Alpha Draconis) in the constellationDraco.3 [part0050.html#note80] At the time of the Greeks it was Beta UrsaeMinoris. In AD 14000 it will be Vega.4 [part0050.html#note81] Sometimes in thislong cyclical journey the extended north pole of the earth will point at emptyspace and then there will be no useful “pole star.”Image Missing [../images/00021.jpeg]The constellation of Draco coils eternally around the pole of the ecliptic.Thuban, in the tail of Draco, was the pole star in 3000 BC.As one of the notable circumpolar constellations, and also one of the mostwidely recognized, and one of the oldest for which written records havesurvived,5 [part0050.html#note82] what makes Draco particularly significant andremarkable was summed up in 1791 in two lines from a poem by Charles Darwin’sgrandfather, the physician and natural philosopher Erasmus Darwin:With vast convolutions Draco holdsTh’ ecliptic axis in his scaly folds.6 [part0050.html#note83]This “ecliptic axis”—astronomers today call it the “pole of the ecliptic”—is thestill, fixed point in the celestial vault around which the vast circle of thenorth celestial pole makes its endlessly repeated 25,920-year journey. It is theone place in the sky that never moves or changes while everything else about itdances and shifts, and once you recognize it for what it is—nothing less thanthe very heart of heaven—it’s striking how the serpentine constellation of Dracoseems to coil protectively around it.If at Angkor that constellation was honored in the form of temples laid out inits image on the ground, then I could see no reason in principle why a similarproject should not have been mounted in North America. In one case the mediumwas stone, with temples targeting the equinox sunrise. In the other it was agreat earthwork targeting the summer solstice sunset.In both cases the result was a symbolically powerful union of ground and sky—aunion, according to Ross Hamilton, that was made manifest not 1,000 years ago,nor even 2,300 years ago, but around 4,800 to 5,000 years ago. That was the timewhen Thuban in Draco was the pole star. And at that same remote date, almost1,000 miles to the south in Louisiana, a site now known as Watson Brake wasbuilt. I will have a great deal more to say about Watson Brake in part 5. As weshall see, it is indisputably 5,000 years old in its present form, and it isRoss’s argument that the same mysterious and as yet unidentified group of NativeAmerican geometers and astronomers who made Watson Brake also made the greatManitou at Serpent Mound.As usual in these matters, however, there’s complexity and nuance behind theheadlines. So, yes, Ross is of the view that a major project was undertaken atSerpent Mound around 5,000 years ago. But as we talk now he clarifies what, forhim, is obviously an extremely important point: “I always make an effort NOT togive people the impression that 5,000 years ago is when the first moundstructure was built on this spot,” he says emphatically:I believe it was a sacred place, with a structure upon it, its connection to thesolstice recognised long before, but that it was remade, renovated, and renewedaround 5,000 years ago, reinforcing the worn-down traces of older foundationsunrealised by conventional dating methods.So there was something here already, a legacy from much earlier times, but 5,000years ago or thereabouts a very well-developed version of the current serpentineeffigy was created as an active, fully functioning Manitou. In accord withNative American legend and mythology it would have been outfitted with thenecessary accoutrements to facilitate earth–sky interaction phenomena, quitesimilar to the way some feel the Great Pyramid and its two sibling pyramids onceoperated.The Cherokee say there was once a powerful crystal mounted at the head of theserpent—a crystal mentioned in Mooney’s nineteenth-century collection ofCherokee “myths. …” That crystal put out a brilliant light that “sullied themeridian beams of the sun.” As the story goes, the crystal was stolen andafterward the people fell into darkness. They revisited the former residences oftheir godly forebears whom they held in highest regard, and gradually took awayrelics of the remaining parts of the Serpent as well, leaving only dirt. Thenthey started taking the dirt also until the culture that archaeologists call theAdena decided to stop the practice and refurbish all the old sites with freshearth and stone to ensure they would survive and that the people would have aliving testament to the former glories of their ancestors. This reclaiming ofthe old holy sites began roughly around 2,500 to 2,300 years ago (in other words2,500 years after the creation of the Manitou), and continued until about AD 500when everyone mysteriously vanished or went their separate ways to look forother places in the Mississippi Valley to refurbish. The ancient country ofManitouba was vast, and so there were plenty of other sites to fix up andrededicate. Hence an explosion of remarkably adept architectural masterpiecesall throughout much of the Great South and of the Mississippi as we approach thehistoric period—returning full circle to Ohio. In this model, the same wave ofinspiration refurbished the Manitou twice, the refurbishments 1,400 years apart,making it the oldest and youngest, the alpha and omega, of the Ohio Valleyantiquities.I’m doing the mental arithmetic. “So the ‘Fort Ancient’ work at Serpent Mound1,000 years ago was the second of these restoration projects?”“That’s right,” Ross replies, “as hopefully everyone, even the archaeologistsinvolved in wrongly attributing the Mound solely to the Fort Ancient cultureback in 1996, are now beginning to realize.”THE MANITOU AND THE MEGALITHDEEP IN CONVERSATION, WE’VE WALKED along the bank of Brush Creek at the base ofSerpent Mound ridge to its northwestern end where it comes to a point naturallytargeting the summer solstice sunset. Trees and bushes cover everything hereexcept the snout of the ridge itself, which thrusts a gnarled and weatheredlimestone cliff forward through the green veil, revealing an overhang and hintsof caves.Ross stops and holds up a hand. “Do you see it?” he says.I look around. I’m bad at tests! Then my eyes fall on a chunky, moss-coveredlimestone megalith leaning into the bank among the undergrowth. It’s not finelyquarried but its relatively straight sides and corners, and the curved sectioncut out at one end, make it likely that humans have worked on it. It’s over 9feet in length, about 2 feet wide and something more than a foot thick, almostbig enough to stand in at Avebury or Stonehenge as a replacement for one of thesmaller megaliths there.Image Missing [../images/00022.jpeg]ABOVE RIGHT: Unenhanced image (PHOTO: SANTHA FAIIA) of the Serpent’s headsimulacrum in the cliff directly beneath the head of Serpent Mound. ABOVE LEFT:An enhanced image helps to explain why many travelers, and the ancients beforethem, could imagine this natural rocky outcrop as the head of a serpent. BELOW:Juxtaposition of Serpent Mound and the ridge on which it stands with its natural“serpent-like head.”“Do you mean this megalith?” I ask.“We’ll come to that,” says Ross, “but look past the megalith. Look above it.”“I see a cliff.”“But do you see the face in the cliff?”The moment Ross says the word “face” everything swings into focus for me. It’snot a human face but a serpent’s face. That overhang is an upper jaw, there’sthe line of a mouth below it. Above the corner of the mouth to the right, muchdarker than the rest of the face, a distinct eye seems to gaze down at us.In later research I’ll find that many visitors have noticed the resemblance ofthis completely natural outcrop to the head of a serpent. In 1919, for example,Charles Willoughby of Harvard University’s Peabody Museum visited Serpent Moundand concluded:The site chosen for this great effigy was probably determined largely bysuperstitions which may have been connected with the headland upon which it wasbuilt. This headland, rising to a height of about 100 feet, gradually narrowsand terminates in a cliff, bearing a certain resemblance to the head of areptile. … The contour of the head, the muzzle, the eye and mouth are clearlyindicated. The Indians may also have seen in the promontory extending backwardfrom the head along the shore of Bush creek, the body of the serpent deity.Natural formations, peculiarly shaped stones, concretions, and other objectsresembling human or animal forms or any of their parts were generally supposedto possess supernatural powers, and in this instance, with a little imagination,one can easily approach the Indian’s point of view.7 [part0050.html#note84]Earlier, in 1886, archaeologist W. H. Holmes came away from Serpent Mound with asimilar impression. “Having the idea of a great serpent in the mind,” he wrotein Science,one is at once struck with the remarkable contour of the bluff, and especiallyof the exposure of rock, which readily assumes the appearance of a colossalreptile lifting its front from the bed of the stream. The head is the point ofrock, the dark lip-like edge is the muzzle, the light coloured underside is thewhite neck, the caves are the eyes, and the projecting masses to the right arethe protruding coils of the body. The varying effects of light must greatlyincrease the vividness of the impressions, and nothing would be more naturalthan that the Sylvan prophet … should recognize this likeness and should at onceregard the promontory as a great Manitou. His people would be led to regard itas such and the celebration of feasts upon the point would readily follow.With a mound-building people, this would result in the erection of suitableenclosures and in the elaboration of the form of the reptile, that it might bethe more real. The natural and the artificial features must all have related toone and the same conception. The point of naked rock was probably at first andalways recognised as the head of both the natural and the modified body. It wasto the Indian the real head of the great serpent Manitou.8[part0050.html#note85]We’re still standing by the megalith that first caught my attention. “What aboutthis?” I ask. “Is this part of the Serpent Mound story or just a random chunk ofrock?”Ross shrugs. “Nobody knows for sure.” He pauses before adding, “I’ve got my owntheory though.”“Which is?”“I think it’s one of the large stones that Squier and Davis reported had stoodin the oval earthwork in front of the Serpent’s head in the nineteenth century.”“The ones they said had been scattered by some treasure hunter?”“That’s right,” Ross replies. “And if I recall correctly, they also said thosestones had been arranged in a circle before they were thrown down.”I know what Ross is reminding me of here is a connection he’s written aboutbetween the geometry of Stonehenge and the geometry of Serpent Mound, which heregards as “two elements comprising a larger picture pointing to a highlyevolved school of astro-architecture, the origin of which is not known.”9[part0050.html#note86]Image Missing [../images/00023.jpeg]Graham Hancock (left) with Ross Hamilton (right) at Serpent Mound megalith.PHOTO: SANTHA FAIIA.Therefore, while he does not dispute that Serpent Mound was the work of NativeAmerican geometers and astronomers, he believes that they were members of a mucholder school and implementing a much older design which likewise—at manydifferent times and in many different media—was brought into commission in manyother parts of the world as well.This fundamental, endlessly reiterated, endlessly reincarnated design, he says,“seems to have no home base—no specific country or culture responsible for itsphenomenon.”10 [part0050.html#note87]This, however, is precisely what we would expect if it’s “home base” were a lostcivilization destroyed so completely, and so deeply buried in time, that it hasbeen reduced to the stuff of myths and legends.WHAT THE SERPENT SEESIN THE HOUR BEFORE SUNSET, as a refreshing chill enters the air, we’re back atthe upper level of Serpent Mound with all batteries charged and the drone readyto fly.The sun, which rose north of east this morning, seems already drawn down low onits arc toward its setting point on the northwestern horizon, and again wenotice the effective “blinding” of the serpent by the dense trees allowed toflourish along its line of sight as a matter of deliberate policy by the OhioHistory Connection. It’s obvious, if we did not have the drone, that we wouldget at best only faint impressions and hints of the alignment if a few scatteredsunbeams somehow found their way through the thicket.“This isn’t how it’s supposed to be!” I say to Ross. “It feels almost likesacrilege.”“But the good news is people are waking up again, here and everywhere else.Regardless of what the Ohio History Connection wants or does, or what thearchaeologists tell us we should believe, we’re at one of those junctures in thecycle where the Manitou is reactivated as a source of knowledge and wisdom.”With a soft buzz of its rotors, Santha’s little drone climbs into the sky and wecluster around the monitor to share the aerial view. It’s 7:55 pm and from analtitude of 400 feet uncluttered by trees, we can see that the sun still hassome distance to travel before it conjuncts the range of hills forming the localhorizon to the northwest. The warm, mellow light of the end of a summer’s dayinterspersed with patterns of cool, deep shade dapples the immense earthworkalong its entire length and despite the trees closing in around its head itseems truly master of its enchanted kingdom.Santha has the drone hovering in place near the back of the Serpent’s neckoverlooking its open jaws, the great oval, the trees, and the horizon farbeyond. It’s the perfect shot but by 8:12 pm, the glare is so intense that it’sdifficult to be certain exactly where the sun now sits in relation to thehorizon. There’s a great scooped out hollow of silver light there and the sun’sdisk is somewhere in the middle of it. A shift in position of the drone,however, confirms that sunset is still some time off.At 8:13 pm, we bring the device down for a battery change and relaunch it, butjust 11 minutes later, at 8:24, the control panel lights up with a low-batterywarning. The ponderous roll of the earth toward the east, the majestic descentof the sun toward the west, seem to have synced into a kind of slow-motion dreamsequence and, with no alternative, hoping we have not miscalculated the timingof the universe, we bring the drone back to earth.There’s something seriously wrong with it. Not the battery problem—that waseasily solved—but something in the communications between the control unit andthe little quadcopter. In the 28 minutes it takes to fix it we can feel thelight leaching out of the sky. The evening air grows cool and the shadows castby the trees lengthen. The sun’s still in the heavens—somewhere!—but whether ithas dropped behind the hills yet or whether we’ll still have a chance to witnessthat moment is completely unclear when the drone finally starts to obey ordersagain and we’re able to relaunch it at 8:52 pm.Santha rockets it straight up to 400 feet, to the vantage point she’d foundbefore, and we all give a cheer as we see in the monitor, as though by somemiracle, that the sun is indeed still with us and poised exactly on the rim ofthe hills that the Hardmans dubbed “Solstice Ridge.”The next 3 minutes are magical as the great luminary, source of all life onearth, begins its final descent into night. It’s a transformation and atransition rather than an abrupt change of state.The glare that dazzled the camera earlier is much reduced now, and little bylittle the sky fills with the most seductive soft glow and the sun’s disk seemsto excavate a niche in the horizon, where, as readers can confirm from thephotographs, its setting is indeed in very fine alignment with the open jaws ofthe Serpent.There it reclines, seemingly still, shedding its brilliance and beneficenceacross this golden land of bounteous fields and forests, as though in deepcommunion with the earth. I’m reminded of a passage from the Ancient EgyptianBook of the Dead, a hymn addressed to Ra the Sun God:Men praise thee in thy name “Ra” and they swear by thee, for thou art lord overthem. Thou hearest with thine ears and thou seest with thine eyes. Millions ofyears have gone over the world; I cannot tell the number of those through whichthou hast passed. … Thou dost pass over and dost travel through untold spacesrequiring millions and hundreds of thousands of years to pass over; thou passestthrough them in peace and thou steerest thy way across the watery abyss to theplace which thou lovest; this thou doest in one little moment of time, and thenthou dost sink down and dost make an end of the hours.11 [part0050.html#note88]Over Serpent Mound the drama continues to unfold, this love affair of planet andstar, ground and sky, above and below, this beautiful and moving alignmentsustained for a long, lingering interval as the sun continues its descent.Half its disk has disappeared from view now, then three quarters, then just aglimmering, radiant shimmering sliver somehow enduring on the horizon, and thenat last it’s gone entirely but for a warm, all-embracing afterblush thatblossoms in the gloaming.OLD CERTAINTIESIF SERPENT MOUND HAD BEEN kept clear of trees by the successive cultures thatvenerated and repeatedly restored the great effigy, then the alignment withinthe wide spread of the Serpent’s jaws would always have been a striking featurehere from the time of the retreat of the ice sheets more than 13,000 years ago.Because of the shifting tilt of the earth’s axis, however, the exact point onthe horizon where the summer solstice sun would set would shift several degreesnorth and south of its present position over the 41,000-year obliquity cycle.We’ve already seen how the Hardmans were taken to task in the 1980s formistakenly proposing a summer solstice sunset alignment at an azimuth as viewedfrom Serpent Mound that—according to the calculations of their critics Fletcherand Cameron—coincided with a date of 11,000 BC. Archaeologists at the timeconsidered that date far too early for any civilization capable of creating astructure of the scale and complexity of Serpent Mound to have evolved in NorthAmerica and accordingly no further investigation of this rather intriguinganomaly was ever undertaken.The 1980s are long gone, however, and in the twenty-first century, as we’ll seein part 2, new evidence has emerged that calls all the old certainties intoquestion."},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00024.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00025.jpeg]A PAST NOT SO MUCH HIDDEN AS DENIEDALTHOUGH HE HIMSELF IS NOT an archaeologist, Tom Deméré, curator of paleontologyat the San Diego Natural History Museum in California, does have occasion towork with archaeologists. I was therefore not surprised when his response to myrequest to interview him and have him show me certain stones and bones in themuseum’s archives was declined. My initial approach was on September 18, 2017,and the polite refusal came on September 20, not from Dr. Deméré himself butfrom Rebecca Handelsman, the museum’s communications director. “While we’reunable to accommodate your request for a meeting,” she wrote, “I’d like to sharewith you our online press kit which has a wealth of information about theproject and the discovery.”1 [part0050.html#note89]Though they have their place, press kits are low on my list of priorities whenI’m researching books, and because of the very special nature of what Rebeccacalled “the project and the discovery,” I was not going to be so easily fobbedoff. Deméré had been closely involved from the outset with the excavation of acontroversial site near San Diego and had published a paper in 2017 claimingthat humans had been present there as early as 130,000 years ago.2[part0050.html#note90] The paper was a prominent one, since it appeared in theprestigious scientific journal Nature, and almost immediately aroused the furyof archaeologists committed to a much later date for the peopling of theAmericas.Among them was Professor Donald Grayson of the University of Washington.3[part0050.html#note91] “I have read that paper,” he sniped, “and I wasastonished by it. I was astonished not because it is so good, but because it isso bad.”4 [part0050.html#note92]In a response that was typical of many, David J. Meltzer, professor ofprehistory at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, also dismissed thepaper. “If you are going to push human antiquity in the New World back more than100,000 years in one fell swoop,” he said, “you’ll have to do so with a farbetter archaeological case than this one. I’m not buying what’s being sold.”5[part0050.html#note93]Gary Haynes, professor emeritus of anthropology at the University of Nevada,went so far as to accuse Nature of “an editorial lapse in judgment” forpublishing the paper at all.6 [part0050.html#note94]Jon M. Erlandson, director of the University of Oregon’s Museum of Natural andCultural History, said “the site is not credible.”7 [part0050.html#note95]Earlier, foreseeing such reactions, George Jefferson, former associate curatorof the Page Museum in Los Angeles, had warned Deméré that the archaeologicalcommunity, invested in long-established notions of the recent peopling of theAmericas, wasn’t even close to being ready for a claim of antiquity as remote as130,000 years. “Keep it under wraps,” he advised. “No one will believe you.”8[part0050.html#note96]But Deméré was sure of the evidence and decided to go ahead. The Nature paper,published in April 2017, was the result and quickly caught my attention.DON’T SAY A WORD ABOUT LOST CIVILIZATIONSCOULD DEMÉRÉ’S CLAIM BE TRUE? Rather than having been in America for 30,000years or less, as archaeologists have recently been dragged kicking andscreaming to accept, could our ancestors have populated the continent 130,000years ago or more?If the facts checked out (and, I had to keep reminding myself, despite thehostile reactions of some academics, that Nature would not have published thepaper without having it thoroughly peer-reviewed first), then they raisedserious question marks over how complete our understanding of prehistory reallyis.In particular, and to get right to the point, what could those very earlyAmericans and their descendants have been doing during all the tens of thousandsof years that archaeologists insisted they weren’t present at all? My wholefocus, since long before the publication of Fingerprints of the Gods in 1995,has been a quest for a high civilization of remote antiquity, a civilizationthat can rightly be described as “lost” because the very fact that it existed atall has been overlooked by archaeologists. I couldn’t help but wonder,therefore, whether some traces of it might be found in those 100,000 lost yearsof the Americas.So I persisted with Deméré, writing to him several times through the formidableRebecca Handelsman, setting out the reasons why I wanted to interview him andproviding more background on my own work. “Is it possible,” I asked, “thatmissing pages in the story of the origins of civilization might await discoveryin North America—the very last place, until now, that archaeologists havethought to look?”9 [part0050.html#note97]Pointing out that other, now-extinct human species had been present in the world130,000 years ago and had interbred with anatomically modern humans, I alsoasked which species of human he thought might have been involved at his site.“Were they anatomically modern? Were they Neanderthals? Were they Denisovans? Orwere they one of the several other species of Homo that will likely beidentified by further research in the coming years?”10 [part0050.html#note98]For days I heard no more and then, on October 2, 2017, Rebecca wrote again toreport that Dr. Deméré had agreed to a “brief meeting” with me, that he waswilling to discuss his site and the evidence for an early human presence that ityielded, but that he would not “speculate on what species it may have been or onbroader topics/hypotheses re ancient civilizations.”11 [part0050.html#note99]I accepted these constraints and the interview was arranged for the next day,Tuesday, October 3. Whatever I got out of him it would surely add something tothe museum’s press kit and, besides, Deméré’s reticence made perfect sense tome. The last thing he wanted while his own work was under attack was to beassociated with what archaeologists call “crackpot theories” about a lostcivilization promulgated by a “pseudoscientist” like myself. If I were in hisshoes, frankly, I would have been cautious, too. Indeed, I was quite surprisedthat he’d agreed to talk to me at all.FORGOTTEN AMERICAAT THE OUTSET OF THE twentieth century many scholars took the view that theAmericas had been devoid of any human presence until less than 4,000 yearsago.12 [part0050.html#note100]To put that in perspective, by 4,000 years ago the civilization of Egypt wasalready ancient, Minoan Crete flourished, and Stonehenge and other greatmegalithic sites had been built across Europe. Likewise, by 4,000 years ago, ourancestors had been in Australia for about 65,000 years and had found their wayto the farthest reaches of Asia at almost equally remote dates.13[part0050.html#note101]So why should the Americas have escaped this global migration, and thisseemingly unstoppable march toward high civilization, until so late?The answer, perhaps, is that the most influential figure in disseminating andenforcing the view that the New World had only recently been populated by humanswas a frowning and fearsome anthropologist named Aleš Hrdlička who, in 1903, wasselected to head the newly created Division of Physical Anthropology at theSmithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC.There he would remain until his death in 1943, deploying his intimidatingauthority as “the most eminent physical anthropologist of his time,” “thegatekeeper of humankind’s recent origins in the New World” to quash any andevery attempt to suggest great human antiquity in the Americas.14[part0050.html#note102] Frank H. H. Roberts, a colleague of Hrdlička’s at theSmithsonian, would later admit of this period, “Questions of early man inAmerica became virtually taboo, and no anthropologist desirous of a successfulcareer would tempt the fate of ostracism by intimating that he had discoveredindications of respectable antiquity for the Indian.”15 [part0050.html#note103]But eminence can only suppress facts for so long, and throughout the 1920s and1930s compelling evidence began to emerge that people had reached the Americasthousands of years earlier than Hrdlička supposed. Of particular importance inthis gradual undermining of the great man’s authority was a site calledBlackwater Draw near the town of Clovis, New Mexico, where bones of extinct IceAge mammals were found in 1929 and assumed, rightly, to be very old. TheSmithsonian sent a representative, Charles Gilmore, to take a look at the sitebut—perhaps unsurprisingly under Hrdlička’s malign shadow—he concluded that nofurther investigation was justified.16 [part0050.html#note104]Anthropologist Edgar B. Howard of the University of Pennsylvania disagreed.17[part0050.html#note105] He began excavations at Blackwater Draw in 1933, quicklyfinding quantities of beautifully crafted stone projectiles with distinctive“fluted” points—so-called on account of a characteristic vertical “flute” orchannel cut into the base. The points were found in direct association with (andin a few cases even buried between the ribs of) extinct Ice Age fauna such asColumbian mammoth, camel, horse, bison, saber-toothed cat, and dire wolf.18[part0050.html#note106] In 1935, on the basis of these finds, Howard published abook in which he concluded that it was possible that humans had been in NorthAmerica for tens of thousands of years.19 [part0050.html#note107] Furtherseasons of meticulous fieldwork followed before he presented his findings, towidespread approbation and acceptance, at a prestigious international forum onEarly Man and the Origins of the Human Race held in Philadelphia on March 18–20,1937.20 [part0050.html#note108]Hrdlička was there. He gloweringly ignored the implications of the discoveriesat Blackwater Draw and instead used his time onstage to reaffirm his long-heldposition that, for American Indians, “So far as skeletal remains are concerned,there is at this moment no evidence that would justify the assumption of great,i.e. geological, antiquity.”21 [part0050.html#note109]But the clock was ticking. Before and after 1943, the year in which both Howardand Hrdlička died, further discoveries of fluted points of the Blackwater Drawtype—increasingly referred to as “Clovis points” after the nearby town of thatname—continued to be made. This ever-accumulating mass of new evidence left noroom for doubt and even the most stubborn conservatives (Hrdlička excepted) wereeventually forced to agree that the Clovis culture had hunted animals thatbecame extinct at the end of the last Ice Age and that humans must thereforehave been in the Americas for at least 12,000 years.This gave a huge boost to research, leading in the decades ahead to thediscovery of around 1,500 further Clovis sites, and more than 10,000 Clovispoints, at locations scattered all across North America.22[part0050.html#note110] As the net widened, however, a number of anomalies ofthe culture began to be identified. A confusing outcome of this is that thereare now two schools of thought around its proposed antiquity and duration. Theso-called long interval school dates the first appearance of Clovis in NorthAmerica to 13,400 years ago and its mysterious extinction and disappearance fromthe archaeological record to around 12,800 years ago—a period of 600 years.23[part0050.html#note111] The “short interval” school also accepts 12,800 yearsago for the end date of Clovis but sets the start date at 13,000 yearsago—therefore allowing it an existence of just 200 years.24[part0050.html#note112] Both schools agree that this unique and distinctiveculture must have originated somewhere else because, from the first evidence forits presence, it is already sophisticated and fully formed, deploying advancedweapons and hunting tactics.25 [part0050.html#note113] Particularly puzzling,since it is the archaeological consensus that the human migration into theAmericas was launched from northeast Asia, is the fact that no traces of theearly days of Clovis, of the previous evolution and development of itscharacteristic tools, weapons, and lifeways, have been found anywhere in Asia.26[part0050.html#note114] All we can say for sure is that once it had made itspresence felt in North America the Clovis culture spread very widely across ahuge swath of the continent,27 [part0050.html#note115] with sites as far apartas Alaska, northern Mexico, New Mexico, South Carolina, Florida, Montana,Pennsylvania, and Washington state.28 [part0050.html#note116] Such an expansionwould have been extremely rapid were it to have occurred in 600 years and seemsalmost miraculously fast if it was in fact accomplished in 200 years.29[part0050.html#note117]Image Missing [../images/00026.jpeg]An array of Clovis points with a Clovis blade second from left. PHOTOS: SANTHAFAIIA AND, FAR RIGHT, NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM OF UTAH.THE LAND BRIDGE AND THE ICE-FREE CORRIDORDURING THE 1940S AND 1950S, as the fame of Clovis continued to grow, no evidencewas forthcoming—or, to state the matter more exactly, none that was generallyaccepted, approved, and confirmed by the archaeological community—of any kind ofhuman presence in the Americas older than the earliest Clovis dates of around13,400 years ago.As regards the matter of general acceptance, despite a few dissenting voices30[part0050.html#note118] a consensus soon began to emerge that no older cultureswould ever be found—and what is now known as the “Clovis First” paradigm wasconceived. We might say, however, that it was not officially “born” untilSeptember 1964. That was when archaeologist C. Vance Haynes, today RegentsProfessor Emeritus of Anthropology at the University of Arizona and a seniormember of the National Academy of Sciences, published a landmark paper in thejournal Science. Snappily titled “Fluted Projectile Points: Their Age andDispersion,”31 [part0050.html#note119] the paper presented, and persuasivelysupported, a number of key assertions.First, Haynes pointed out that, because of lowered sea level during the Ice Age,much of the area occupied today by the Bering Sea was above water, and where theBering Strait now is, a tundra-covered landscape connected eastern Siberia andwestern Alaska. Although not a particularly easy environment, it would, Haynesargued, “have presented no obstacle” to nomadic hunters who were already mastersof the Siberian tundra and who would certainly have followed the herds of bison,deer, and mammoth that roamed across it.32 [part0050.html#note120]Once over the land bridge, however, it was Haynes’s case that the migranthunters could not have ventured very far before confronting the daunting barrierof the Cordilleran and Laurentide Ice Sheets, which were at the time merged intoa single impassable mountainous mass covering most of the northern half of NorthAmerica.Image Missing [../images/00027.jpeg]They therefore had no access to the lands that lay beyond. As a result,prevailing in the ice-free southern half of North America during this phase ofthe last Ice Age were “conditions as favorable to the existence of herbivorousmegafauna, which man could hunt, as conditions during the time of the Clovisoccupation, yet there is not the slightest evidence of man’s presence.”33[part0050.html#note121]Things changed around 14,100 years ago, Haynes claimed, when a generalizedwarming of global climate caused an ice-free corridor to open up between theLaurentide and the Cordilleran ice caps, allowing entry for the first time inmany millennia to the rich, unglaciated plains, teeming with game, that lay tothe south.34 [part0050.html#note122]Some 700 years later, around 13,400 years ago, the stratigraphic record of thoseplains starts to include Clovis artifacts. Their “abrupt appearance,” Haynesargued, supports the view “that Clovis progenitors passed through Canada” andthat “from the seemingly rapid and wide dispersal of Clovis points … it appearsthese people may have brought the technique of fluting with them.”35[part0050.html#note123]As noted earlier, no Clovis points have ever been found in Asia,36[part0050.html#note124] but when Haynes published his landmark paper in Sciencein 1964 he reported correctly that four had been found “on the surface” inAlaska and another in the Canadian Yukon, all undated,37 [part0050.html#note125]with the oldest dated points south of the former ice margin going back nofurther than 13,400 years. To Haynes this looked like the last link “in alogical sequence of events, and the pieces begin to fall into place. If Clovisprogenitors traversed a corridor through Canada … and dispersed through theUnited States south of the … ice border in the ensuing 700 years, then they wereprobably in Alaska some 500 years earlier. … The Alaskan fluted points … couldrepresent this occupation and could, therefore, be ancestral to Clovis pointsand blades.”38 [part0050.html#note126]The paper was welcomed by archaeologists,39 [part0050.html#note127] most of whomwere already convinced that Clovis was “First,” and virtually overnight what hadbeen at best a persuasive and seemingly well-constructed theory morphed into thenew ruling orthodoxy. Worse, it soon became every bit as rigid and intolerant asthe orthodoxy of Hrdlička’s time and it would retain ultimate authority overarchaeological careers and research priorities for decades to come with a gripevery bit as firm as Hrdlička’s iron fist.In a familiar refrain, those who disagreed with “Clovis First,” or werefoolhardy enough to report possible pre-Clovis sites, did so “at significantrisk to their careers.”40 [part0050.html#note128] Indeed by 2012 the bullyingbehavior of the Clovis First lobby had grown so unpleasant that it attracted theattention of the editor of Nature, who opined: “The debate over the firstAmericans has been one of the most acrimonious—and unfruitful—in all of science.… One researcher, new to the field after years of working on other contentioustopics, told Nature that he had never before witnessed the level of aggressionthat swirled around the issue of who reached America first.”41[part0050.html#note129]CHALLENGING CLOVIS FIRSTTOM DILLEHAY, PROFESSOR OF ANTHROPOLOGY at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee,began excavations at Monte Verde in southern Chile in 1977 and found evidencethat humans had been present there as far back as 18,500 years ago.42[part0050.html#note130] The progress of science eventually vindicated him, as weshall see, but before it did so Dillehay had to endure sustained and oftendeeply unpleasant personal attacks from Clovis Firsters for more than 20 years.He was attacked because there are no Clovis artifacts at Monte Verde, it is5,000 years older than the oldest securely dated Clovis sites, and it is locatedmore than 8,000 miles south of the Bering Strait.The reader will not have forgotten that the strait was dry during the loweredsea level of the last Ice Age—a tundra-covered land bridge across which theClovis people were believed to have migrated on foot from northeast Siberia andthence into the Americas through the ice-free corridor between the Cordilleranand Laurentide Ice Sheets. The credibility of Clovis First depends crucially onthe supposed close chronological link between the opening up of that ice-freecorridor around 14,100 years ago and the first appearance of Clovis artifactssouth of the ice margin around 13,400 years ago. By putting humans in theAmericas more than 4,000 years before the opening of the ice-free corridor,Monte Verde showed that “link” to be illusory. Moreover, by putting them not inNorth America but in South America, with no means of transport available to themother than boats of some sort, it questioned fundamental assumptions about thetechnical and organizational capacities of our ancestors, hitherto judged to betoo low to allow such adventures at such a remote period.Tom Dillehay’s most dogged and determined critic, perhaps predictably, has beenC. Vance Haynes, whose 1964 paper launched the Clovis First theory and who by1988 had used his influence, and his outreach in the scientific journals, todismiss every case thus far made for supposedly pre-Clovis sites in theAmericas.43 [part0050.html#note131]Except Monte Verde. Even for Haynes, this Chilean site was proving to be anexceptionally tough nut to crack. Realizing that the implications for Americanarchaeology of Tom Dillehay being right were immense, Haynes wrote to DavidMeltzer at SMU to suggest that “a panel of objective conservatives should beformed and funded by NSF [National Science Foundation] to visit the site,examine it, take samples, etc. If a positive consensus results we can thenaccept the interpretation and formulate new hypotheses for the peopling of theNew World. If not, Monte Verde will have to be relegated to the bin of possiblepre-Clovis sites awaiting further data.”44 [part0050.html#note132]James M. Adovasio, a world expert in perishable artifacts and former director ofthe Mercyhurst Archaeological Institute at Mercyhurst University in Erie,Pennsylvania, was closely involved in the events that followed. He tells us thathe would be remiss if he “did not point out that by the oxymoron ‘objectiveconservatives,’ Haynes meant himself and the Clovis First disciples.”45[part0050.html#note133]In the end, however, after 7 years of haggling, a balanced group was puttogether, “not configured as a panel of pre-Clovis skeptics or, conversely,pre-Clovis enthusiasts,” says Adovasio: “rather, it was, as designed, a mixedbag reflecting a range of views.”46 [part0050.html#note134]The site visit took place over 3 days in January 1997, and far from relegatingMonte Verde to the “bin,” all members of the group eventually signed on to anofficial report confirming that it was indeed an archaeological site and thatDillehay’s dates were correct. The report was published in October 1997 inAmerican Antiquity and left no room for any conclusion other than that MonteVerde predated Clovis; it even considered the “extremely intriguing” possibilitythat the human presence there might go back as far 33,000 years.47[part0050.html#note135]In his important book The First Americans, Adovasio, who was present at theproceedings throughout, provides a blow-by-blow account of how the panel arrivedat its conclusions, and of the follow-up.48 [part0050.html#note136] It seemsthat Haynes was not happy, despite being a signatory to the report, and even asit appeared in print he began to voice doubts over it to colleagues, questioningagain the antiquity of Monte Verde and “suggesting a wondrous new array ofhypothetical events that could have contaminated the site in some previouslyunperceived way.”49 [part0050.html#note137]Haynes and Adovasio had crossed swords before—over Meadowcroft, a site inPennsylvania that Adovasio had excavated in the 1970s that revealed elevenwell-defined stratigraphic units with evidence of human occupation “spanning atleast 16,000 years and perhaps 19,000 years.”50 [part0050.html#note138]Inevitably, because it threatened Clovis First, this attracted the hostility ofHaynes, who, in the years that followed, sought to quibble away almost everyaspect of Adovasio’s evidence: “In scientific paper after scientific paper,Haynes … asked for yet another date, yet another study, raising yet otherpicayune and fanciful questions about Meadowcroft, most of which had beenanswered long before he asked them—not just in the original excavationprocedures but in report after report.”51 [part0050.html#note139]Again, as was the case with Monte Verde, the constant quibbling and demands forever more evidence, when the evidence in place was already more than adequate,was demoralizing and had the effect of slowing down the research effort butultimately did not prevent formal recognition of Meadowcroft Rockshelter as aNational Historic Landmark with an age of more than 16,000 years.52[part0050.html#note140]Likewise, in the 1990s, Canadian archaeologist Jacques Cinq-Mars excavatedBluefish Caves in the Yukon and found evidence of human activity there datingback more than 24,000 years—older than Meadowcroft and much older than Clovis.The price he paid was high. His competence and his sanity were questioned andwhen he attempted to present his findings at conferences he was ignored orinsulted.53 [part0050.html#note141] One colleague stated matters bluntly: “WhenJacques proposed [that Bluefish Caves were] 24,000 [years old], it was notaccepted.”54 [part0050.html#note142]As a result of such attitudes, funding drained away and Cinq-Mars had to stophis work, only to be proved correct, many years later, by a new scientific studyof the evidence from the caves published in January 2017.55[part0050.html#note143]That study, one of several that confirmed the existence of pre-Clovis sites ofincreasingly ancient dates,56 [part0050.html#note144] was titled Earliest HumanPresence in North America.Only 4 months later, on April 27, 2017, Tom Deméré’s paper announcing thediscovery of “a 130,000-year-old archaeological site in southern California,USA,” appeared in Nature.57 [part0050.html#note145]That’s about ten times older than Clovis, eight times older than Meadowcroft,and more than five times as old as Bluefish Caves.The resulting furor was, in retrospect, inevitable."},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00028.jpeg]MESSAGE FROM A MASTODONTHE SAN DIEGO NATURAL HISTORY Museum, affectionately known to locals as “TheNat,” is situated in the lush gardens of Balboa Park, which served as the venuefor the 1915 Panama-California Exposition. Originally called “City Park,” it wasrenamed for the exposition in honor of Spanish-born Vasco Nuñez de Balboa(1475–1519), who conducted a murderous exploratory raid across Panama and becamethe first European to see the Pacific Ocean.1 [part0050.html#note146]Balboa Park was repurposed after the closure of the exposition and now hostsseventeen museums and cultural institutions, among which The Nat stands out forits excellent collections and for its research expertise. As Santha and Istrolled toward it on a bright Southern California morning, we couldn’t help butreflect on the irony. In a museum in a park named after an arriviste Europeanadventurer, we were about to be shown evidence that might speak to the trulyvast antiquity of Native Americans in the lands that Europeans had stolen fromthem with fire and sword.Rebecca Handelsman had asked us to meet her at The Nat’s south entrance but wewere early so we spent some time in the north atrium first, which is dominatedby a looming skeleton cast of an Allosaur, a predatory dinosaur a bit like itsmore famous younger cousin Tyrannosaurus rex.Scientists now agree that T. rex and the entire nonavian Dinosauria clade becameextinct virtually overnight after a large asteroid or comet—more likely thelatter2 [part0050.html#note147]—hit the Gulf of Mexico around 65 million yearsago. There is also no doubt that it was this sudden and cataclysmic eradicationof dinosaurs from the planet that opened the way for the rapid, uncontestedexpansion into new niches of the hitherto-insignificant mammalian line. Wehumans today are among the descendants of those early mammals.It’s thought-provoking, isn’t it, that cosmic impacts, whether by asteroids orby comets, can sometimes be of such magnitude that they drastically redirect theevolutionary path of life on earth. It has happened more than once, as we shallsee. However, a cataclysm was not to blame 130,000 years ago when a lonemastodon, perhaps old or sick, died on a floodplain in Southern California andwas subsequently scavenged, with the carcass then quite rapidly covered by, andentombed in, a deposit of silty, sandy, fine-grained sediment.3[part0050.html#note148] There it remained undisturbed until November 1992, whenthe California Department of Transportation undertook highway construction onState Route 54 where San Diego borders National City.4 [part0050.html#note149]It was routine practice for paleontologists from The Nat to monitor road-gradingin Southern California in case any important fossil material was exposed, andRichard Cerutti, the monitor on duty at SR 54, spotted the fossilized bones andthe tusk of what he at first thought was a mammoth.5 [part0050.html#note150] Hehalted construction in the immediate vicinity until a proper excavation could beundertaken, and called in his boss, Dr. Tom Deméré, to lead it.6[part0050.html#note151]Working together with a team of other researchers from The Nat, Cerutti andDeméré very quickly established that the fossilized remains, including manybones, both tusks, and several of the animal’s teeth, belonged to a mastodon.7[part0050.html#note152] Like the mammoths, to which they were closely related,mastodons were swept from the face of the earth in the sudden and mysteriousextinction of America’s Ice Age megafauna that took place around 12,800 yearsago8 [part0050.html#note153]—the same epoch exactly that saw the equally abruptand equally mysterious disappearance of the Clovis culture.From quite early on both Cerutti—after whom the site is now named—and Deméréwere intrigued by what the excavation revealed: “Many of the bones werestrangely fractured—or missing entirely. And there were several large stones,found in the same sediment layer as the bones and teeth, that appeared out ofplace. It looked like an archaeological site—like the preserved evidence ofhuman activity.”9 [part0050.html#note154]As well as the hefty rocks, unusual in fine-grained sediment, smaller pieces ofsharply broken stone were found peppered throughout the Cerutti Mastodon Site:“This is not typically something you would see as a result of normal geologicalprocesses. The combination of stones … together with broken bones wasinteresting and instigated speculation regarding the possibility of humanactivity at the site.”10 [part0050.html#note155]At first intriguing, the implications of the data grew worrying when it began tobecome obvious that the site was extremely ancient, lying embedded in sediments“that had been deposited much earlier, during a period long before humans werethought to have arrived on the continent.”11 [part0050.html#note156] In theearly 1990s, radiometric techniques capable of peering much further back intothe past than the standard 50,000-year limit for carbon dating12[part0050.html#note157] were already available. Unfortunately, however, they hadnot yet attained sufficient accuracy to give scientists a high level ofconfidence in the age range suspected for the Cerutti Mastodon Site.13[part0050.html#note158]The end result, after key finds were moved to The Nat where they were housed inthe archives, was that the site was reburied and abandoned. Despite itsanomalous character and suspected importance, it was just too explosive to putbefore the scrutiny of hostile archaeologists while the dates remaineduncertain. “If you claim something is that old you get blasted,” Cerutti said,referring to the Clovis First lobby, “which is why some archaeologists stoppedworking on sites like this. They didn’t want to get blasted.”14[part0050.html#note159]It wasn’t that the Cerutti Mastodon Site was completely forgotten in the 25years after the excavation stopped. It’s on record that Tom Deméré invitedseveral other researchers to study the collection of key finds kept at The Nat,but none did so.15 [part0050.html#note160]Robson Bonnichsen, founder of the Center for the Study of the First Americans,warned him that “research that contributes to First American Studies is a gameof hardball.”16 [part0050.html#note161]Months ran into years with no journal article on the site even drafted, letalone published, nor any further investigation undertaken. Cerutti, reportedly,was so disappointed that he stopped going anywhere near State Route 54.17[part0050.html#note162] The whole exciting matter seemed to have fallen intostagnation.It was not until 2014, more than two decades after the mastodon’s discovery,that the tide decisively turned.18 [part0050.html#note163] Built on improvedunderstanding of processes that incorporate natural uranium and its decayproducts in fossil bone, a newly enhanced technique, known as 230 Th/Uradiometric dating, was now available that could settle the age of the Ceruttideposit once and for all. Deméré therefore sent several of the mastodon bones tothe US Geological Survey in Colorado, where geologist Jim Paces, using theupdated and refined technique, established beyond reasonable doubt that thebones were buried 130,000 years ago.19 [part0050.html#note164]Now things began to move much more swiftly and it was time to reexamine thestrange fractures on some of the bones that had been noticed back in 1992 andalso to take a much closer look at the “out of place” stones and rocks found inthe same sediment layer. To this end the large and eclectic team ofinvestigators who would eventually coauthor the landmark 2017 paper in Naturehad already begun to form. Tom Deméré and Richard Cerutti were at the heart ofit but other members included Dr. Steve Holen, curator of archaeology at theDenver Museum of Nature and Science, a specialist in the ancient uses of bone,Professor Daniel Fisher of the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences,University of Michigan, Dr. Richard Fullagar of the Centre for ArchaeologicalScience, University of Wollongong, and Dr. James Paces, Research Geologist atthe US Geological Survey.20 [part0050.html#note165]It was a formidable team, their work was meticulous, and publication of thepaper in Nature meant that archaeologists, just then cautiously emerging fromthe shadow of the Clovis First paradigm and adjusting themselves with difficultyto ages in the few tens of thousands of years for sites like Monte Verde,Meadowcroft, and Bluefish Caves, were now obliged to contemplate a site datingback to the Eemian, the last interglacial period that extended from roughly140,000 years ago down to about 120,000 years ago when the Pleistocene icesheets began to expand again.21 [part0050.html#note166]At that point in 2017 it was still believed—though new evidence would soonsubstantially change the picture22 [part0050.html#note167]—that anatomicallymodern humans had not even left their African homeland 140,000 years ago.So how could they possibly have gotten to America before they’d even set out onthe epic migrations by which they populated the world?Having researched the Clovis First wars, and indeed the whole story ofprehistoric archaeology in the United States from the late nineteenth centuryonward, I was just beginning to realize how staggering the implications of allthis really were.TOM DEMÉRÉ’S BONES AND STONESTHE NAT’S MAIN ATRIUM, WHERE the allosaur lurks, is accessed through themuseum’s north entrance, so just before 11 am Santha and I walked around thewest side of the four-story building and presented ourselves at the southentrance. Beyond it was a second atrium, where we were encouraged to see thatmuch of the space was devoted to a well-attended exhibition honoring the CeruttiMastodon Site.Out of the crowd, Rebecca Handelsman appeared. Tom Deméré would join us in amoment, she said. While we waited, she walked us over to a display casecontaining a mock-up of the sediment matrix from the site into which, point downand visible through the glass side of the case, was set a mastodon tusk. It wasa little shorter than my arm, but it was obviously not complete as the upperpart had been crudely broken off.“This is the tusk that first attracted Richard Cerutti’s attention,” Rebeccaexplained, and before I could ask she added, “Its upper part was clipped off bythe backhoe before he could stop the construction work.”“Is the way it’s displayed here the way it was found?” I asked.“Exactly that way.” She paused and waved. “Look, here’s Tom. He can tell you allabout it.”Weaving through the crowd was a man of pleasant aspect, spare and lean after alifetime of fieldwork, wearing blue jeans and a brick-red shirt. From mybackground reading I knew he was 69 years old, though he appeared younger, andas we shook hands I saw he had penetrating gray eyes and an easy smile. Despitethe risk to his reputation of even talking to a “pseudoscientist” like me, heseemed relaxed and friendly.I launched straight in on the subject of the tusk. “What’s so special about it?”I asked Tom.“The way it was set into the ground so it would have stood upright. The otherone lay in a natural horizontal position beside it but this one was found likeyou see it in the display. Vertical. And that, to us, immediately looked like ananomaly.”“Why?”“One suggestion is that it was perhaps left there as a marker to come back tothe site on a floodplain where everything is low relief. … I mean, who knows? Idon’t know what sort of noncultural process would put a tusk vertical. I justdon’t understand it.”“So what you’re saying is that this looks like the result of human behavior?That it’s evidence of a deliberate, intelligent act?”“It seems like that to me, and to many others—though I have to say our criticsaren’t persuaded!”I take this as my cue to ask Tom if he and his team had been surprised by thelevel of skeptical response to the Nature paper.“I expected we’d have pushback,” he replied. “I just hoped it would have beenmore objective.”“I suppose that in any profession and any career people get very emotionallyinvolved …”“Apparently! I’m not used to it from a paleontological standpoint. I mean,there’s passion in paleontology, too, but I’m not used to this sort of thing.”I restrain myself from stating my view that “this sort of thing”—namely sniping,quibbling, misrepresentation, straw-man arguments, and vituperative ad hominemattacks leveled against anyone suggesting deep antiquity for the FirstAmericans—is perfectly normal among archaeologists, and Santha and I gratefullyaccept Tom’s offer to talk us through the exhibits.The anomalous tusk is just a small part of the story, he says. The strongerevidence comes from the mastodon’s fossilized bones, and from the rocks andstones of various sizes found distributed around the site.23[part0050.html#note168]In humans the femur is the long bone of the thigh. At its upper end it has aball-like protrusion, the femur head, that articulates with a socket in thepelvis and thus—wondrous nature!—enables us to walk. Though they stood on fourlegs it was no different for mastodons. Their femora were their upper hind limbsand, just like our femora, were surmounted by ball-like heads set into theirpelvic sockets.Tom draws our attention to the hefty, almost hemispherical detached heads of themastodon’s two femora, one with the rounded end down, the other with the roundedend up, sitting side by side in a display case. “This is how they were foundwhen we excavated them,” he says. And he points out a rock next to them that hecalls an “anvil stone,” adding that there wasn’t much left of the femorathemselves.The significance of this is not immediately obvious to me so I ask Tom toelaborate.“We suggest that this was a work station,24 [part0050.html#note169] that bothfemora were hammered and broken here on the anvil stone and that the heads weredetached and just set off to the side. It feels purposeful, like the tusk. Itfeels like humans were breaking these bones and it’s not only what’s here that’simportant but also what’s not here. I mean, originally the femora from whichthese heads came were three feet in length and massively thick, yet we have justa few pieces of them …”“So that would suggest, what, that the other pieces were taken away?”“Yes. I mean, if it was equipment damage, you’d think you’d have the wholefemur, right? So the fact that we have missing bits suggests to us that theywere taken away, which fits this idea of human processing and transportation.”In the next display case are the few large fragments of femur that were found atthe site and multiple smaller flakes of bone that were found lying around them.“We interpret these as cone flakes,” Tom explains. “So when a bone is struck bya stone hammer you have damage on the impact side but also you have these flakescome out on the other side. At the point of impact you have a small hole and theexit point of that impact is a larger hole, and so these are flakes that arecreated by impacts.”“I suppose one question would be—they took away bits of the femora, so whydidn’t they take the tusks? Because the tusks, presumably, would have offeredthem useful materials, too?”“But they’re also heavy,” Tom points out. “Whereas bones are relativelytransportable. We have a pattern and the pattern begs for an explanation andwhat we feel fits that pattern is human transportation.”“Did you find anything that was obviously a tool?”“No.” Tom appears untroubled by what some critics regard as a fatal argumentagainst his case.I seek clarification. “So if we’re saying that humans did this, then we’resaying that they just took advantage of natural rocks and they used those ashammers and anvils basically?”25 [part0050.html#note170]“That’s one of the problems the skeptics have,” Tom admits cheerfully, “thatthere are no fashioned tools, no flaked stone tools, that there are no knives,no scrapers, no choppers.”“But if I’m correct, you’re arguing that can be explained—because what theseancient humans were doing was extracting the marrow from the bones.26[part0050.html#note171] They were smashing up the bones. They didn’tparticularly need fine tools for this.”“That’s what we’re saying. We’re saying that this was a carcass. It wasn’tkilled by these humans. It wasn’t even butchered by these humans. Most likely itwas a carcass at an advanced stage of decomposition but it still had potentialfor the extraction of marrow from the bones.”“Some critics have claimed it was the backhoe or the grader or other equipmentused in the roadworks that broke the bones,” I point out.27[part0050.html#note172] “Others have argued that they were broken by beingrolled against rocks carried along in river water when the surrounding sedimentwas laid down.”28 [part0050.html#note173]Tom raises an eyebrow. “Flow velocities that are strong enough to transportrocks like the big anvil stones are going to carry all the finer material muchfarther away. And yet we still have all that fine material at the site—smallstones, small bone fragments, and obviously the associated silt and sand, too.So there really is a disjunct in terms of the hydrology.”Addressing the suggestion of Cerutti skeptic Gary Haynes that the bones werebroken by the roadmaking equipment in 1992,29 [part0050.html#note174] Tomlaunches into a long and detailed exposition. It’s too technical to try thereader’s patience with here, but the takeaway is that a recently broken,fossilized bone has a very different appearance to a bone broken when it wasstill fresh, within a short time of the animal’s death. Experiments carried outby Deméré’s colleague Steve Holen on the bones of a recently deceased Africanelephant showed that the characteristic spiral fractures that occur when youdeliberately and systematically break fresh bone between a stone hammer and astone anvil in no way resemble the fractures caused by the teeth of scavengersor predators and simply cannot occur in fossilized bones.30[part0050.html#note175] The presence of spiral fractures among the bones of theCerutti mastodon therefore leads to the inevitable conclusion that they musthave been broken 130,000 years ago, when they were fresh.31[part0050.html#note176]Meanwhile, the presence of the hammer and anvil stones, and the evidence of howthey were used to break the bones, makes it equally certain that humans wereinvolved.32 [part0050.html#note177]“Because,” I muse, “nothing else is going to smash up those bones and take outthe marrow in that way.”33 [part0050.html#note178]“That’s how we see it,” Tom confirms, “but I’m a scientist so I’m open toalternative explanations if they fit the data better than ours. And so it’spossible that we are wrong. But the evidence suggests to us that the onlyexplanation for the taphonomic data at this site is that humans wereresponsible.”Taphonomy is the study of the circumstances and processes of fossilization, afield that is generally better understood by paleontologists like Tom than byarchaeologists.IF YOU DON’T LOOK, YOU WON’T FINDAFTER WE’VE COMPLETED OUR TOUR of the exhibits Tom takes us behind the scenes atthe museum into areas off-limits to the public. As we ride the elevator up tothe fourth floor I ask him if it was a struggle to get the Nature paperaccepted.“Well, it was a yearlong review process,” he replies, “rigorous, which you’dexpect. I’ve tried publishing in Nature before. It’s not an easy journal to getinto. So we were excited when they sent it out for review. That’s really thefirst hurdle—if it gets off the editor’s desk. Then we went through severalrounds of revisions and re-review and re-revision but eventually it wasaccepted. So that was really exciting. It’s a terrific journal. And that’s theother thing, of course, it’s Nature, it’s not some third- or fourth-tierpublication.”“Absolutely top tier,” I agree as we step out of the elevator, “which is whyit’s had such a huge impact. … I’ve been following the story of the peopling ofthe Americas and for a very long while there was extreme resistance around theso-called Clovis First model. I mean, that was it. It was almost dangerouscareer-wise to propose anything else.”“Apparently,” Tom says.“And then the evidence starts to come in and starts to just overwhelm thatparadigm. We begin to open up to the possibility of 14,000, 15,000, 18,000,25,000 years. And you can see the archaeological community kind of reluctantlyembracing that, but then you come along with 130,000 years and that is a timebomb. Literally. It’s a huge explosion.”Tom’s expression is rueful. “It wasn’t our intention. It was just where theevidence led us.”We enter The Nat’s archives where the larger part of the Cerutti mastodoncollection is permanently stored in a secure room in three huge cabinets. AnIndiana Jones moment follows as Tom grabs a four-spoked steel wheel and spinsit. Soundlessly the cabinets slide apart, avenues appear between them and thenTom is opening drawers and showing us mastodon bones and mastodon teeth and morepieces of rock and stone while Santha takes photographs and we continue talking.The more I see, the more persuaded I am and the better I understand why Naturepublished Tom’s paper. Despite the whines and quibbles of the skeptics, theevidence, once it’s laid out in front of you, once you actually look at thebones and stones, and once the technical details are properly considered, isabsolutely solid and convincing.“What’s next?” I ask. “How do you take this further?”“Well, of course one of the things we’ve said all along to our critics is thatif you don’t look in deposits of this age with the idea in mind that evidence ofhumans could be there, then you’re not going to find anything. So we’resuggesting, as a challenge, that people should start considering, should startto look in these deposits, as a way of testing this hypothesis. I know that’s alot of work, but there are unexamined deposits of this age throughout the US.”“It’s also good science,” I comment. “I mean, not just to rest on a paradigm butto try to look for other possibilities. Again I’m struck by the emotional natureof the reaction your paper has provoked. Some people are quite reasonable butothers almost insultingly reject the whole thing.”“Dismissive! So … I guess the reaction I was looking for was healthy skepticismbut with the idea of—well, let’s look at this now, let’s consider this and whatthe implications are and what sort of predictions can we make about testingthis. … But that’s been a minority of the reactions. We’ve seen the extremes ofboth. Some people say this is pure garbage and others say this is the find ofthe century, but what we’re saying to everyone, really, is open your mind to thepossibility that instead of the peopling of the Americas being associated withthe last deglaciation event [the so-called Bølling-Allerød interstadial, datedfrom around 14,700 years ago to around 12,800 years ago34[part0050.html#note179]] what we should actually be looking at is thedeglaciation event before that—between 140,000 and 120,000 years ago. You getthe same sort of scenario with a land bridge and ice sheets retreating and youget that same sweet spot between really low sea levels and a blockage by icesheets, and ice sheets gone and the flooding of the land bridge.”“And yet,” I reflect, “so much else changes if you’re right. The peopling of theAmericas becomes a whole different story—much more complicated.”“Well,” Tom suggests, “it becomes richer. …”“A much richer and longer story. So much so, in fact, that it’s really hard fora lot of archaeologists to swallow when they’re committed to a shorter timeframe.” I hesitate before raising my next point: “Look … I know we’re notsupposed to talk about this but your date of 130,000 years ago raises thepossibility that it might have been Neanderthals who were at your site, orDenisovans, or anatomically modern humans—because they were all in the world atthat time.”With this comment I’ve taken us into territory I’d specifically agreed would beoff-limits when my request for an interview was accepted, but Tom seems happy toexpress his point of view. “As a paleontologist,” he muses, “I ask thequestion—why weren’t there humans here earlier? I mean, we have dispersal ofEurasian animal species into North America and dispersal of North Americanspecies into Eurasia at earlier times. So why shouldn’t humans have been here aswell?”“And now it looks like they were.”“I’m certain of that from our evidence.”“Which raises the question of why in 150 years of professional studyarchaeologists have failed to find similar evidence.”“There’s always the possibility,” Tom offers, “that our site witnesses a failedcolonization attempt. So you had this dispersal event. It didn’t take, maybebecause population size wasn’t great enough, and they quite quickly died out—inwhich case they would have left almost no trace of their presence forarchaeologists to find. Then thousands of years later there was a successfulcolonization by other migrants and naturally they dominate the archaeologicalrecord.”“It could be like that,” I concede. “But on the other hand, it could be therewere people here all along and they’ve just been invisible to archaeologybecause of the particular way archaeology works and the particular thingsarchaeology looks for.”“You’d have to ask the archaeologists.” Tom shrugs. “But like I say, if you goto a place and you absolutely rule out in advance that humans were there 130,000years ago, then you’re clearly not going to find evidence that they were. But ifyou go with an open mind”—an impish smile—“and dig deep enough in the rightplaces, then who knows what you might turn up?”"},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00029.jpeg]MILLENNIA UNACCOUNTED FORWHEN TOM DEMÉRÉ DUG DEEP enough he turned up evidence of humans in North America130,000 years ago that was sufficiently robust to make it through Nature’srigorous peer-review process and into print in April 2017.By then it was no longer news that the New World had been peopled long beforeClovis. In chapter 4 we saw that Monte Verde, Meadowcroft, and Bluefish Caveshad already pushed back the date of the “First” Americans from around 13,000years ago to at least 24,000 years ago. These, however, are only three sitesamong a growing number that suggest a vast, complex, textured antiquity for thehuman presence in the Americas across ages when hitherto we’ve been asked topicture an uninhabited wilderness awaiting the arrival of Man. No matter howlong it exists, an uninhabited wilderness will not produce a civilization, andit would make no sense to look for one there. But with new evidence continuingto pour forth, it’s increasingly obvious that humans were in the Americas notjust for thousands of years before Clovis, but for tens of thousands ofyears—all the way back to the Cerutti Mastodon Site or earlier—and thus had vastexpanses of time at their disposal to develop in any direction they chose.Wanting to get a better feeling for the time-depth of this mystery leads me,through various contacts and connections, to a walk in the South Carolina woods.It’s early November, a sunny yet cold morning. There’s a mulch of fallen leavesunderfoot but the trees around us are still in foliage, mostly green with mutedhints of autumnal reds and yellows beginning to mottle the canopy. I’m withAlbert “Al” Goodyear, professor of archaeology at the University of SouthCarolina. Around 70 years of age, cheerful and in rubicund good health, he’swearing a South Carolina Gamecocks baseball cap, a navy check shirt, a tweedjacket, and tough outdoor pants tucked into his hiking boots to keep tickscarrying Lyme disease at bay. Our ramble takes us close to the Savannah River,which here forms the border between the states of South Carolina and Georgia.Al is a world expert on the Clovis culture and back in 1998, having excavated anextensive Clovis layer in these woods, he dug deeper. In the end, what he foundwas evidence that humans had been here 50,000 years ago, not as old as theCerutti mastodon by any means, but still a good 37,000 years before Clovis.Unsurprisingly, Clovis Firsters were adamantly opposed and launched a campaignto discredit the find.1 [part0050.html#note180]The site is now called Topper, after David Topper, a local forester. In 1981 hespotted stone tools on the ground here.2 [part0050.html#note181] He notified Al,who a couple of years later launched a comprehensive archaeological survey ofthe Savannah River watershed. As part of this larger project, excavations beganat Topper in 1986 and it was immediately obvious that Native Americans had beencoming here for many thousands of years. Obvious, too, was the reason why—a hugeoutcrop of easily accessible chert, the raw material of a form of flint idealfor making stone tools.3 [part0050.html#note182]Al suddenly stoops and picks up a small, almost translucent piece of reddishflint from the ground at our feet. It is recognizably a fragment of anarrowhead, with a notch near the base. Al confirms my guess that it’s notClovis. “It’s a nice piece,” he says. “It’s been heat treated. It’s probablyabout 8,000 years old.”He draws my attention to an area off the path relatively free of fallen leaveswhere there’s quite a scatter of stones, mostly small broken pieces like thisone. Al refers to them as “debitage” (the technical term for lithic debris anddiscards found at sites where stone tools and weapons were made). “Every flakeon the ground was struck off by a human,” he says, “and you can roughly tell theage. With strong coloration they’re more recent, but if they’re white andcreamy, they’re weathered and older.”Our next stop is the chert quarry, the reason so much was going on around Topperfor so long. “For them this was like aluminum bauxite or iron ore for ourculture,” Al explains. “They didn’t have jackhammers. They didn’t have crowbars.They just had to work what they could get off the surface; maybe set a fire orsomething to push it out. So we call this ‘Topper Chert’—the chert source forthe Topper site.”“I find it amazing,” I say, “that there are still broken points 8,000 years oldjust lying around on the surface whereas you have to excavate to reach othermaterials from that horizon.”The earth is a dynamic place, Al explains, with multiple different processes ofdeposition and erosion under way at all times. You can make guesses based onstyle and weathering, but fragments of worked stone that have been in the openfor an unknown period can’t be dated by their archaeological context, becausethere is none. Carbon-dating organic materials in the sediment in which theywere found won’t work, either, because they were never entombed and preserved insediment. And in fact no other objective and widely accepted method of datingcan tell us how old they are. For these reasons archaeologists have to discountartifacts found on the surface when coming to any conclusions about the age of asite, even though the artifacts themselves may obviously be ancient. Theirpresence, however, does serve as a clue that much more might be awaitingdiscovery underground—which was precisely why Al followed up on David Topper’s1981 suggestion to take a look.THERE’S A FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHINGAFTER THEIR FIRST SEASON OF excavation at Topper in 1986, Al and his teammethodically worked their way down during the next dozen years through thelevels of what was turning out to be a very extensive, detailed, andtime-consuming excavation. There were a number of archaeological “horizons”here, stacked one above the other in nice, easily datable layers of sediment,containing the leavings of different cultures at different, and increasinglymore ancient, periods of the past. “We found pottery down to about 2,000 yearsago,” Al says. “Below that there was no pottery but there were plentifulartifacts from the period we call the Archaic. So we kept on going down and wegot into the Early Archaic [around 8,000 to 10,000 years ago4[part0050.html#note183]]. They made these beautiful little notched points. Andthen below that, in 1998—bingo!—we found Clovis.”Topper is the only Clovis site to be excavated on the coastal plains of Georgiaand the Carolinas.5 [part0050.html#note184] As though by way of compensation,however, the Clovis level at Topper turned out to be so massive that theexcavations there would not be complete until 2013. As he tells me about thetreasure trove of more than 40,000 Clovis artifacts that he and his teamuncovered, Al radiates excitement. And rightly so! It was a tremendousachievement that continues to enjoy renown among archaeologists.6[part0050.html#note185]The same, however, cannot be said for what happened next. “So we got down to thebottom of the Clovis level,” Al continues, “and then we all voted to go deeper.”For the next half meter or so there was just sand and small gravels, devoid ofany evidence of human presence, and then suddenly the excavators foundthemselves among artifacts again.I ask if there was a particular aha moment.Al laughs. “My aha was more of an uh-oh! Everybody else was going aha but theyweren’t going to have to stand up at national conferences and defend what we’dfound.”“Which was evidence of the presence of humans in America tens of thousands ofyears before Clovis?”“Exactly. After we’d done a thorough lab analysis we were certain we weredealing with artifacts.”I ask when he began to feel the inevitable wrath of the Clovis First lobby.“Immediately!” he replies. “It began with ‘we don’t believe in pre-Clovis.There’s no such thing as a pre-Clovis culture.’ Then I think when it wasrealized we’d made a strong case that many of our flake-tool artifacts had beenproduced by the ‘bend-break’ technique, and that the media were already onto thepotential significance of what we’d found, the critics moved the goalposts andsaid things like ‘Okay, we understand bend-breaks but we don’t know of anassemblage anywhere that has so many bend-breaks.’”7 [part0050.html#note186]But the key issue remained the antiquity of the site:The New York Times was here, CNN, they were all holding their stories until thedates came back. And I was thinking maybe they’ll come back at 20,000 years agomaybe even 25,000 years ago, and I’ll be out of here clean. This is going to beeasy. But the date that came back was 50,0008 [part0050.html#note187]—ancientbeyond all imagining and right at the limits of radiocarbon.9[part0050.html#note188] Since then we have OSL-dated the deposit and those datesalso came back in the range of 50,000.10 [part0050.html#note189] So we’ve got itdated two ways, but still the skeptics keep saying that what we’ve found can’tbe a human site and that our artifacts must be works of nature because they’reso different from the artifacts found at other sites. To which my response is:“Well … you’ve never dug a 50,000-year-old site in America, right? There’s afirst time for everything.”THEY UNDERSTOOD THE PROPERTIES OF STONEAFTER OUR PLEASANT HIKE WE’VE reached the main excavation area, a largerectangular pit about 12 feet deep, 40 feet wide, and around 60 feet long, wherethe majority of the archaeology trenches have been left open, in their originalcondition, and the entire area covered over with a roofed shelter. It’stastefully done, allowing in plenty of light but keeping out rain, and it’s aneducation to see the stratigraphy through which Goodyear and his team dug toreach the controversial pre-Clovis levels.Although Topper is located on land owned by a specialty chemicals company andnot open for public access, Al does occasionally bring interested groups here toexplain the site to them, and to this end signs have been set up identifying thedifferent levels. My eyes are drawn immediately to one that says “Clovis Level:13,000 years.” Farther down another reads “Pleistocene Alluvial Sands,16,000–20,000 years.” We step down again to the excavation floor and I see thethick band of clay where the pre-Clovis artifacts were found, labeled“Pleistocene Terrace: 20,000–50,000 years.”Off to the side, laid out as a display, is a row of three or four chunkyfist-size rocks. Al picks one up. “The more abundant pre-Clovis artifacts arefashioned from chert cobbles like this,” he tells me, “but they’re no good toanybody as they are. They have to be cracked open first. You have to get rid ofall this”—he indicates the rough, heavily patinated surface of the cobble—“toget at the stuff inside that can be turned into tools. In experiments we’vethrown cobbles like that, slammed cobbles like that against each other, andnothing breaks.”“So what does break them?”“When we put an 8-pound sledgehammer on them, that did the trick.”“But presumably the pre-Clovis people didn’t have 8-pound sledgehammers?”Al shrugs. “Maybe they did it the way the Australian aborigines used to dealwith big slabs of quartzite. They didn’t have sledgehammers, either. They wouldlight a small fire underneath a face of the quartzite and they would wait for itto get hot enough till they heard a tink, and then they would pull a slab off.So I think you could use fire to prepare the cobble and then maybe break itapart. The point is once you break open a piece of flint like that then you cando anything you want with it. All of the interior surfaces are susceptible toflaking but the cobble in its raw form is not. So when our critics say thatcobbles like these maybe got broken by rolling down the slope of the escarpmentour answer is no.11 [part0050.html#note190] What you need is heat or somethinglike an eight-pound sledgehammer—and even then we had to hit them several timesbefore they broke.”“In other words, only humans could have done this.”“Right. Human beings who understood the properties of the stone and how to workit. If nature can’t break it, it can’t make it.”None of the pre-Clovis tools have been left at the excavation, of course, butbefore we set out for the site this morning Al showed me examples kept at theSouth Carolina Institute of Archaeology and Anthropology exhibit at its nearbyregional campus in Allendale. What quickly became clear, which Al willinglyconcedes, was that they were, without exception, extremely simple and generallyquite small, with unifacial flake tools such as burins and small bladespredominating.12 [part0050.html#note191] The vast majority of the burins, morethan 1,000 of them,13 [part0050.html#note192] were created by the distinctiveflint-knapping technique known as “bend-break,”14 [part0050.html#note193]whereby two edges are “broken off at a 90 degree angle to form a sharp sturdytip that may have been used in the engraving of bone, antler or wood.”15[part0050.html#note194] Flint cores left over after large flakes had been struckoff were also found in close proximity to a large anvil stone.16[part0050.html#note195] It appears there were several, separate rock-chippingstations like this, resembling workstations.17 [part0050.html#note196]A VERY LONG TIMETHE EXTENSIVE EVIDENCE FROM THE pre-Clovis levels at Topper clearly does notdocument the handiwork of any kind of lost advanced civilization. What it speaksto me of instead, like the Cerutti Mastodon Site, is a far more complex andnuanced past for the peopling of the Americas than has hitherto been properlycontemplated.I don’t propose here to give a blow-by-blow account of the fifty or so sites inthe Americas, with more found every year, presently claimed to be of pre-Clovisantiquity.18 [part0050.html#note197] Not all are of the same quality. Some maynot be archaeological sites at all, their supposed “artifacts” perhaps being“geofacts.” Others are very strong.A measure of discernment is therefore needed along this continuum, and what Iobserve is that archaeologists who are open to the notion of greater antiquity(these days the majority apart from a few die-hards) consider the most importantpre-Clovis sites in North America in addition to Cerutti and Topper to include:Hueyatlaco, Mexico;19 [part0050.html#note198] Old Crow and Bluefish Caves,Canada; Calico Mountain, California; Pendejo Cave, New Mexico; Tula Springs,Nevada; Meadowcroft Rockshelter, Pennsylvania; Cactus Hill, Virginia; PaisleyFive Mile Point Caves, Oregon; Schaefer and Hebior Mammoth site, Wisconsin;Buttermilk Creek, Texas; and Saltville, Virginia.20 [part0050.html#note199] InSouth America, Pedra Furada in Brazil, Monte Verde in Chile, Taima-taima inVenezuela, and Tibito in Colombia are likewise singled out as convincingpre-Clovis sites of special interest.21 [part0050.html#note200] However, otherthan some anomalies, indeed some deep mysteries, connected to a select few ofthese sites—which we’ll come to in later chapters—most feature only rudimentarystone-working technologies similar to those of pre-Clovis Topper, although withdefinite evidence of increasing refinement and improved techniques between earlypre-Clovis and late pre-Clovis.22 [part0050.html#note201] Early or late,however, the importance of all these sites, as I view them, has nothing to dowith the level of technology they manifest, whether judged to be “low” or“increasingly refined”—or whatever. They really matter in that they offercompelling proof of the enduring presence of humans of some kind in the Americasfrom perhaps as far back as 130,000 years ago until today.That’s a very long time. It might even be long enough—speaking entirelyhypothetically, of course—for something that we would recognize as an advancedcivilization to have emerged in the Americas alongside the hunter-gatherers,foragers, and scavengers whose simple tools dominate the pre-Clovis horizons sofar excavated.But if such a civilization was indeed present somewhere on the Americanlandmass, how has it escaped the notice of archaeologists up to now while thehunter-gatherers have not? And isn’t it grasping at straws in the first placeeven to suggest that an advanced civilization could have coexisted withhunter-gatherers during the Ice Age?PRECONCEPTIONS ARE BLINKERSLET’S CALL TO MIND HOW things are in our own globally connected twenty-firstcentury. Rio de Janeiro, Bogotá, and Lima are, by any standards, advancedtechnological cities; yet on the same continent, in the depths of the Amazonrainforest, uncontacted tribes of hunter-gatherers remain at a “Stone Age” levelof technology.23 [part0050.html#note202] Likewise, in Africa, Johannesburg, CapeTown, and Windhoek are advanced technological cities, yet you can walk from themto the Kalahari desert where San bushmen, though well aware of the technologicalworld, choose to continue a hunter-gatherer and still largely “Stone Age” way oflife.There are no purely logical grounds, therefore, that can rule out the possiblecoexistence of an advanced civilization with hunter-gatherers during the IceAge.Nor can this—at first sight absurd—possibility be ruled out on archaeologicalgrounds. For more than half a century, as we’ve seen, American archaeology wasso riddled with pre-formed opinions about how the past should look, and aboutthe orderly, linear way in which civilizations should evolve, that it repeatedlymissed, sidelined, and downright ignored evidence for any human presence at allprior to Clovis—until, at any rate, the mass of that evidence became sooverwhelming that it took the existing paradigm by storm.We thus find ourselves in a place now where “Clovis First” can quite definitelybe ruled out, despite the fading protests of a very few zealots still clingingon to that discredited fantasy.24 [part0050.html#note203]At the same time no new ruling paradigm, let alone consensus, has yet taken itsplace. Several are vying for the crown, though all remain rooted in thepreconception that what they must explain is limited to the presence ofrelatively “simple” and “unsophisticated” hunter-gatherers in the Americas muchearlier than had previously been supposed. None have factored in thepossibility—they would be puzzled at the very thought—that a lost civilizationmight be part of the missing picture as well.I’m reminded of Tom Deméré’s point: “If you go to a place and you absolutelyrule out in advance that humans were there 130,000 years ago, then you’reclearly not going to find evidence that they were.”25 [part0050.html#note204]By the same reasoning, if we don’t ever look for a lost civilization—because ofa preconception that none could have existed—then we won’t find one.Fortunately, as we’ll see in part 3, geneticists have developed sophisticatedtechniques for studying ancient DNA that have overturned entrenched thinking andopened completely new and unexpected avenues of inquiry."},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00030.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00031.jpeg]SIBERIAA CROSS BOTH SOUTH AND NORTH America DNA studies have revealed that at somepoint in the remote past, in some unknown location or locations, the ancestorsof Native Americans interbred with an archaic—and now extinct—human species.Only recently discovered, and closely related to the more famous Neanderthalswho also produced offspring with our ancestors, geneticists have named thisspecies “the Denisovans.” Insufficient sampling has been done to establish exactlevels but the current estimate is that 0.13 to 0.17 percent of Native AmericanDNA is of Denisovan origin1 [part0050.html#note205]—with indications in the datathat some indigenous groups, for example, the Piapoco of Colombia and Venezuelain South America and the Ojibwa of northeastern North America, can be expectedto have higher levels of Denisovan DNA than others.2 [part0050.html#note206]We know about the Denisovans because of paradigm-busting discoveries at theeponymous Denisova Cave in a region of rugged highlands known as the Altai atthe extreme south of the Russian Federal District of Siberia. Bordered byMongolia, China, and Kazakhstan, and extending from the Ural Mountains in thewest to the Kamchatka Peninsula and the federal district of Chukotka more that5,000 kilometers to the east,3 [part0050.html#note207] Siberia covers 13.1million square kilometers—around 77 percent of the total geographical area ofRussia. The Urals form a prominent part of the dividing line between Europe andAsia. Kamchatka and Chukotka stand at the junction of the Pacific and ArcticOceans, with Kamchatka’s coast washed by the waters of the Bering Sea whileChukotka commands the Bering Strait.Image Missing [../images/00032.jpeg]Presently 82 kilometers wide between Cape Dezhnev in Chukotka and Alaska’s CapePrince of Wales, during the last Ice Age the Strait was drained by lowered sealevels and a tundra-covered land bridge—“Beringia”—connected Chukotka withAlaska. In other words, at that time, Europe, Asia, and the Americas were onecontinuous landmass. Should you have had the inclination and the stamina, therewere certain periods when it would have been technically possible to walk fromthe Atlantic coast of what is now Spain, across western and eastern Europe tothe Urals, through the Urals, through Siberia, across “Beringia,” into Alaskaand Canada, down through the “ice-free corridor” dividing the two primary sheetsof the North American ice cap, into the United States and thence through CentralAmerica into South America as far as Tierra del Fuego before again encounteringanother ocean—a narrow one during the Ice Age when Antarctica was much larger.4[part0050.html#note208]No investigation of the human story in the Americas, therefore, can ignore therole of Siberia as a crossroads in the migrations of our ancestors. Moreover,despite the fact that only a tiny fraction of its vast area has yet been sampledby archaeologists, we already know that anatomically modern humans were presentin both western and Arctic Siberia at least as far back as 45,000 years ago.5[part0050.html#note209] We know, too, that DNA studies have revealed closegenetic relationships between Native Americans and Siberians that speak to adeep and ancient connection.6 [part0050.html#note210]ANOMALIES IN THE DATAWITH A FEW NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS,7 [part0050.html#note211] it was the consensusview of archaeologists and anthropologists during the period of “Clovis First”dominance that the Americas were settled exclusively by the overland route fromSiberia via “Beringia” and southward through the ice-free corridor. Despite thecollapse of “Clovis First,” this remains the consensus view today; however, ithas been finessed to accommodate the discovery of ever more sites in North andSouth America predating the opening of the ice-free corridor that thereforecould not possibly have been settled by migration through it.8[part0050.html#note212] In addition, several subsequent studies have pointed outthat for much of its duration long stretches of the supposed ice-free corridorwould have been completely uninhabitable and thus most unpromising territory fora lengthy migration.9 [part0050.html#note213]To explain how migration might have taken place at all, therefore, and toaccount for the growing mass of archaeological and genetic evidence suggestingthat humans had been in the Americas, isolated from Asia, for thousands of yearsbefore Clovis, two theories have recently found favor: 1. A “Beringian standstill” model (within which scholars continue to debate) whereby, in the simplest terms, having crossed the land bridge into Alaska perhaps as much as 30,000 years ago, the migrants found their southward progress blocked by the conjoined Cordilleran and Laurentide Ice Sheets. More or less simultaneously their return to Siberia was interdicted by the expansion of glaciers in Siberia’s Verkhoyansk Range and in Alaska’s Mackenzie River Valley.10 [part0050.html#note214] Their descendants were therefore obliged to spend between 10,000 and 20,000 years stranded in Beringia before further climate shifts allowed them to spread south into the Americas. During this “incubation period” the now isolated population experienced certain genetic changes that would distinguish them from their northeast Asian ancestors at the level of DNA while at the same time confirming their close ancestral relatedness.11 [part0050.html#note215] 2. A “coastal migration” theory whereby the first migrants were boat people who crossed the narrow island-strewn neck of the North Pacific from northeast Asia into the Americas.12 [part0050.html#note216] This coastal theory relies heavily on the so-called Kelp Highway migration model, which notes that the deglaciation of North America’s Pacific Coast presented migrants with a region rich in kelp and other aquatic resources that could support their journeys. The coastal model also relies on the unarguable presence, though scarce, of early Paleolithic northwest American archaeological sites. Such coasting could have been undertaken at any time during lowered Ice Age sea levels, particularly when Beringia was exposed, could have been achieved with extremely simple technology such as rafts and coracles, and often would not have required the migrants to lose sight of land. Since we know that other ancient peoples migrated by sea as much as 65,000 years ago—for example, the crossing of the Timor Straits by the first migrants to Australia13 [part0050.html#note217]—there can be no objection in principle to the Americas being inhabited in the same way.All this seems thoroughly reasonable and I have no doubt that both thingshappened. Island-hopping migrants in simple vessels suitable for shortopen-water crossings did indeed contribute significantly to the peopling ofAmericas. Similarly, one need look no further than Jacques Cinq-Mars’sexcavations demonstrating a human presence 24,000 years ago at Bluefish Caves inthe Yukon to confirm that there is truth to the Beringian Standstill model,too.14 [part0050.html#note218]But are these revised and finessed models, currently very much in vogue witharchaeologists, sufficient to explain all the complexities and anomalies in thedata that science offers on the peopling of the Americas?SERGEY AND OLGAIN EARLY SEPTEMBER 2017, A couple of months before visiting Topper with AlGoodyear and a month before meeting Tom Deméré at The Nat in San Diego, Santhaand I applied for Russian visas and declared our destination as Denisova Cave inthe Altai.The visas were expensive, the dauntingly opaque application forms took a greatwhile to fill out, and in the general fog of bureaucratic time-wasting we beganto wonder if we might have to postpone the trip until the spring of 2018 whenthe Siberian winter would have come and gone. Russia is more efficient than itlooks, however, and we had our visas within a week.Still, it was going to have to be a very quick visit with a big American journeyplanned from the end of September through until close to the end of November.There was no time for sightseeing, therefore, when we flew to Moscow onSeptember 12, overnighted at Sheremetyevo, and caught a connecting flight thenext morning to Novosibirsk, the Siberian capital, a four-hour flight and fourtime zones east of Moscow.After landing and collecting our bags Santha and I were met groundside by ourlocal connection, Sergey Kurgin. I say “connection” because you have to have oneif you’re going to travel in Russia. You can’t just get up and go. Some solidcitizen, or business, or tour operator must take responsibility for you andofficially invite you, and you must have a prearranged and preplanned itineraryto preapproved destinations or your visa won’t be issued—nor, if you somehowmanage to slip through the net, will any hotel accommodate you on your route.Image Missing [../images/00033.jpeg]Sergey owns a small private travel business called Sibalp, and I’d contacted himon the internet to help set up the trip. Negotiations were complicated by thefact that he spoke no English—he was perplexed that I spoke no Russian—butvarious translators got involved and a deal was done. Sergey would drive us the600 kilometers or so from Novosibirsk to Topolnoye, a township in the Altai,where we would stay with a local family while we visited the cave about 20kilometers farther on. When we were done he would drive us back to Novosibirsk.He would arrange all accommodation en route and find us an interpreter, withoutwhom we would be unable to speak to anyone. Joining Sergey at the airport tomeet us, therefore, was Olga Votrina, the bilingual student from NovosibirskState University who’d be interpreting for us.Novosibirsk is a city of monotone drabness with an oppressive, regimented,Soviet-era feel to it. Olga was cheerful and nervous, wanting very much to be agood interpreter and guide. Thickset and grizzled, Sergey was an older manperhaps in his seventies, but solid, gruff, and strong. He owned afour-wheel-drive Mitsubishi minivan that had at some point been imported, used,from Japan and thus had its steering wheel on the wrong side. It was batteredand creaky with a pronounced and disconcerting tug to the right, but as he droveus through the geometric grid of Novosibirsk’s streets, Sergey assured us it wasup to the journey ahead.Our hotel was in the academic quarter, a stone’s throw from the Museum of thePeoples of Siberia. We spent the following morning viewing artifacts fromDenisova Cave, and in the afternoon we set off on the long road south beneathleaden, wide-open skies across a remarkably flat landscape relieved by patchesof muted color—black earth here, green field there, rank upon rank of hay balesset upon yellowing stubble marching toward the remote horizon. There wassomething lulling and dreamlike about the whole scene; I drifted off to sleepand when I awoke, darkness had fallen.Sergey was downing a can of Red Bull and gripping the juddering wheel tightly ashe weaved in and out of the surprisingly heavy Siberian traffic. Despite hisdisadvantageous position on the wrong side of the road he was doing well and bymidnight we had two-thirds of the journey behind us and stopped to sleep in thetown of Biysk.We were back on the road again early the next morning—a much brighter and morecheerful day—and drove 65 kilometers farther south to Belokurikha, near whichthere were rumored to be some intriguing megaliths that Sergey believed he wouldbe able to locate.15 [part0050.html#note219] Quite different from the flatlandsof the day before, we were now on the borders of the Altai Mountains, and spentthe next several hours in the region of Mt. Mokhnataya16 [part0050.html#note220]driving off-road through fields, circling likely looking hills covered inoutcrops of granitic rocks, and asking farmers for directions. Eventually we meta man who knew a man who knew the couple, Vladimir Illych and Raisa Stepenov,both in their late sixties, who were said to have discovered the allegedmegaliths. An hour later we were sharing bread and honey with them in their homein the village of Nizhnekamenka. This was followed, quaintly, by a tour of theirvegetable garden and an invitation—how could we refuse?—to pick raspberries andblackberries from the briars growing in abundance there.It was early afternoon by the time Vladimir and Raisa, their daughter Svetlana,and their strapping young grandson Maxim all crammed into Sergey’s groaningminivan with us. It seemed we had been in roughly the right place all morning,missing the site only by about half a mile. I was excited that we were finallygoing to see it, but as we set out again on the bumpy off-road drive Vladimiradvised me to lower my expectations. In his opinion the media coverage had beenmuch ado about nothing and the so-called megaliths he was about to show us werenatural rock formations.BEHIND THE HEADLINESTHE INFORMATION THAT THERE MIGHT be ancient megaliths here in the Altai, quiteclose to Denisova Cave, had come to me by way of a news item in theEnglish-language edition of The Siberian Times published on May 8, 2017. Therather compelling headline reported the discovery of “Dragon and GriffinMegaliths” dating back to the end of the Ice Age.17 [part0050.html#note221]“Archaeological researchers” named Aleksandr and Ruslan Peresyolkov were citedsuggesting the enigmatic monuments were likely to be at least 12,000 years oldbut that precise dating would be impossible until “the culture that created themis identified.”18 [part0050.html#note222]This is always a problem with monuments carved out of stone. The cutting andshaping of the stone itself cannot be directly dated. What is needed is anarchaeological context in which the monument is set—preferably withcarbon-datable organic materials in situ—and from these the age of the monumentmay then usually be inferred. Since there was no excavation at Mt. Mokhnataya,however, no context had yet been established and the archaeological researcherswere surely right that precise dating was presently impossible.But what sort of “archaeological researchers” had even these provisionalassessments reported in The Siberian Times come from? The news item gave noinformation about their credentials, nor could I find any online. The only clue,and not necessarily a reliable one, was in the comments section where RuslanPeresyolkov was described as “a little-known web-designer and not anarchaeologist (not even an amateur).”19 [part0050.html#note223]We humans are hardwired for pattern recognition, so it’s not surprising thatpeople all over the world frequently detect patterns in nature that they believeare the work of men but later, on closer examination by cooler and moreexperienced heads, prove to be entirely natural. This happens particularly oftenwith eroded outcrops of rock, notably with certain types of granite that cancrack and weather in ways that seem obviously designed but in fact are not.Archaeologists are trained to be skeptical of such simulacra and their defaultposition will be that a rock is just a rock until there is really hard andcompelling evidence that humans shaped it. Needless to say, if the rock inquestion ended up as a granite statue of Ramesses II, the context and the style,plus any hieroglyphs engraved upon it, would tell you all you need to know.Granite boulders that have been sitting on an unexcavated hillside in the Altaifor unknown thousands of years, however, are an entirely different proposition,and I wasn’t inclined to take any opinion of them on trust whether expressed bya fully qualified archaeologist or by a web designer or, for that matter, byVladimir.I was just curious, and literally “in the area”—so why not take a look formyself?MESSAGES OF EARTH AND SKYWE DROVE AS CLOSE AS possible to a rugged hill that I recognized from ourearlier search, and trudged across a field to get to it. Raisa, who’d recentlyhad hip replacement surgery, remained behind in the Mitsubishi, but Vladimir,Svetlana, and Maxim joined us—the young man kindly offering to carry Santha’sweighty bag of cameras.We reached the base of the hill and began a long clamber up a steep slopethickly carpeted with wild grasses, heather, and clinging brambles. Svetlanawarned us that the area was infested with snakes. “Always look before you step,”she said.The afternoon was sunny and surprisingly warm and the sky an eggshell blue witha few soft white clouds up high. At one point, pausing for breath, I turned andlooked back. Behind us, dotted with lower mounds and hills, was a patchworkquilt of greens and yellows spread out for 20 miles across the floor of aglorious valley. It was through this valley and around these hills that we hadspent the morning fruitlessly driving. Now, from this new vantage point, I sawit was bounded to the east by the humped, tawny backs of a distant range ofmountains. I watched for a moment the shadows of the clouds painting their ownpatterns across the landscape, struck by the poignant, fleeting beauty of itall.We resumed the climb, close now to our first objective—an outcrop of rough,deeply fissured and fractured natural granitic bedrock, visible because theotherwise omnipresent undergrowth could find no purchase on it. It was red-grayin color, about 50 meters in length and 20 wide, obviously an integral part ofthe hillside itself, sloping at the same steep angle and surmounted at its upperend by a dense cluster of large boulders. “The tail of the dragon,” saidVladimir skeptically, pointing to the downslope sector of the outcrop, “and thehead”—he indicated the boulders.At first I didn’t get it, but once we’d climbed above the outcrop and could lookback and down on it, a figure began to emerge. I could just about make sense ofthe tail and I could see the head clearly—but not as the head of a dragon.Viewed very slightly turned in profile from where I stood it seemed to me muchmore to resemble the head and the left eye of some great serpent.I was, of course, already sensitized and preconditioned to recognize the form ofa serpent in the outcrop, perhaps a little by Svetlana’s warning of snakes inthe grass in these parts but also, in an even more visceral way, by what I hadlearned at Serpent Mound in Ohio.The “language” that Serpent Mound speaks is hard to understand from thetechnological-materialist point of view. That view, so dominant and widespreadtoday, is one in which there is no such thing as “spirit” and the earth issimply dead “matter” to be mined, exploited, and consumed. By contrast theancient people to whom Serpent Mound addressed itself in clear and ringing tonesnot only knew that all things, both animate and inanimate, were imbued withspirit but also lived close to the earth and were in touch with Her rhythms andawake to the manifold messages and signals and ciphers by which She spoke tothem.Among these were perfectly “natural” features of the landscape through which,whether on account of their special appearance, or location, or alignment, orsome other remarkable quality, the spirit of the earth could manifest wisdom,beauty, and teachings. Serpent Mound is one of these “Manitou,” and we saw howthe presence there of a natural serpentine ridge, with a natural serpentlike“head” oriented toward the setting point of the sun on the summer solstice,offered an epiphany to the ancients of the union of earth and Sky and was theircue to create the great effigy mound that now commands the site and still“swallows the sun” on the longest day of the year.Nearly 3 months had passed since that summer solstice at Serpent Mound. Now theautumn equinox was just a few days away and I was very far from America, yet ina part of the world directly linked to the migrations of the ancestors of theFirst Americans. I was therefore not averse in principle to considering thepossibility that this peculiar formation in the Siberian Altai might be another“Earth Serpent,” enhanced and embellished by human beings attentive to theciphers of nature.But it equally might be how Vladimir saw it—simply one of those accidents ofnature that give the illusion of a human hand at work.From the rough bearings I was able to take, though I offer no guarantees, itseemed to me that the serpent’s head (I could not see it as a “dragon!”) wasoriented more or less due west and thus aligned to the setting point of the sunon both the spring and the autumn equinoxes. About 2 meters high and 4 meterslong to the base of the neck, the head was massive and possessed a distinct browridge overlying the firmly defined left eye. Moving forward, I saw the mouth waspresent, the jaws clearly demarcated and slightly ajar. There was a peculiarcleft in the front of the lower jaw.Image Missing [../images/00034.jpeg]The Altai “dragon/serpent.” Graham Hancock at the left side of the “head” withhis hand on its lower left eyelid.

PHOTO: SANTHA FAIIA.Much of this, apart from that odd gap, was moderately serpentlike—but only onthe left side of the serpent’s head. When I scrambled around to view the rightside it was as though I were suddenly looking at a completely differentstructure—not a serpent at all but a megalithic wall built from ten hefty erodedbut precisely interlinked granite blocks. Somehow, whether by nature or by humanbeings, a structure had been created that appeared to be a wall on one side andthe head of a serpent on the other.If this was done by humans, I reasoned, then surely they would have wanted tomake both sides look the same?On the other hand, if it was done by nature, how were we to account for theblocks—and, even more difficult—the combination of blocks and serpentsimulacrum?Either on its own might be explained by weathering, but for both to occurtogether in such a limited area seemed much less likely.A few hundred meters farther up the hill the so-called griffin shed no greaterlight on the problem. Another rocky outcrop was involved, this time orientedsouth, and into its granite face, 3 meters tall from the base of its neck and 5meters wide from the tip of its beak to the crest on the back of its head, wascarved the likeness of some immense, mythical, hook-beaked bird—hence itsdesignation as a “griffin.”Image Missing [../images/00036.jpeg]The Altai “Griffin.” Natural? Or modified by human hands? PHOTO: SANTHA FAIIA.Natural? Or modified by human hands?An argument against it being man-made is the way that the lower part of the beakis unfinished and unseparated from the surrounding bedrock. An argument in favorof human enhancements of the natural bedrock is that directly beneath the crestare three small alcoves set side by side step fashion. It is difficult toenvisage how nature alone could have achieved this effect. And, besides, thereare similar rock-hewn structures in the high Andes of South America that areindisputably man-made.As we climbed back down the hill Vladimir remained unpersuaded but I wasn’t sosure and a few days later, after returning to Novosibirsk where we had access tofast internet again, I searched for information about the region’s snakes.What I learned was that there are six species of serpent in the Altai and thatthe largest, most venomous and most respected of these by far is Gloydius halys,the Siberian pit viper.In my opinion its clearly defined eyes, its brow ridges, the general shape ofits head, and the way that its forked tongue is sometimes thrust out, allowingit to hang down over the middle of its lower jaw creating the illusion of acleft in that jaw are all rather closely mimicked by the granite features of the“Earth Serpent” we trudged up and down that hill in the Altai to inspect.But does that make it a remnant of a megalithic Ice Age civilization? Or even amegalith at all? Certainly not! And the same goes for the “griffin.” Yet theyare set in the heart of a region of mystery where previously held certitudesabout humanity’s past have been shattered by the discoveries at Denisova Cave.After saying our good-byes to Vladimir, Raisa, Svetlana, and Maxim, as eveningfell over that sunny Siberian day, we drove the remaining 80 kilometers south toTopolnoye, only 20 kilometers from the cave. There another friendly,down-to-earth couple waited to welcome us into their home and feed us not onlybread and honey but milk fresh from the cow and other delicious, nourishingthings.ENTERING THE DENISOVANS’ SECRET VALLEYOUR NEW HOSTS WERE PAPIN Asatryan, dark-haired and bearded, a migrant to theAltai from Armenia when it was still part of the former Soviet Union, and hisblond Siberian wife, Elena Darenskikh. They were both in their fifties, theirchildren long ago grown up and fled the nest. Like most of the other 1,100inhabitants of Topolnoye they had regular jobs (Papin was a builder, Elena anaccountant), but also owned a few cows and goats and a fair-sized vegetablegarden, growing enough food, it seemed, to make them self-sufficient in mostessentials.That night over a fantastic dinner I joked that if twenty-first-centurycivilization were to collapse it would be people like Elena and Papin who wouldsurvive—not people like me who’ve never hunted a deer or grown a cabbage ormilked a cow in their lives.“Don’t worry,” Elena said, “we will save you!”Some eye-watering local vodka was served, followed by a surprisingly comfortablenight’s sleep on bunk beds and a sunlit morning greeted with an ample breakfastof eggs, bread, jams, fruit, coffee, and a jug of clotted cream. Then Sergeyfired up the Mitsubishi and we were off along a reasonably good road, graded butnot paved, running beside the Anui River, fast-flowing with patches of whitewater, reminding me of the trout streams my grandfather used to fish in theScottish Highlands where I would sometimes accompany him when I was a child.For Santha the landscape had more of a “Tolkienesque” quality. Guarded bydistant, soaring peaks, we were in a deep, hidden valley, sometimes darklyshadowed and enclosed, sometimes opening out suddenly and unexpectedly intoundulating hills and hummocks where coppices of mixed autumnal woodlandoverlooked bright meadows at the river’s edge.For geologists the landform here is known as “karst,” a special type oftopography created by the random dissolution over millions of years of soluble,usually sedimentary rocks—in this case limestone. Like all such landscapes it ischaracterized by extensive underground drainage systems, sinkholes, and caves,of which Denisova Cave is just one among many. Some are already known to containancient human remains and artifacts, but far more have not yet been properlystudied, or studied at all, by archaeologists.20 [part0050.html#note224]Sergey pulled the Mitsubishi over and parked beneath a freshly minted NationalMonument sign, painted brown and helpfully labeled “Denisova Cave” in bothRussian and English. Narrow here between low banks, the river was behind us,forested to its edge on the far side and with a saw-toothed range of mountainsrising in the distance beyond. On our bank the trees had been cleared and infront of us, across the road, rising steeply for about 200 meters, was a grassyslope with a wooden stairway constructed on its upper part leading to a ruggedsilver-gray karst cliff at the base of which gaped the black, almost squaremouth of the cave.It is, arguably, the most important archaeological site in the world, and yetnot a soul was here, not a scientist, not a tourist, not even a guard. The wholeplace was eerily deserted, silent but for birdsong and the gentle rustle of windthrough the grass, marking time under the sun as it had done for millennia, theguardian of many mysteries still.Not that I minded the solitude and the peace.What a privilege, I thought, what a gift, to be here on this bright morning andto have this ancient place to ourselves."},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00037.jpeg]HALL OF RECORDSDENISOVA CAVE HAS HAD ITS modern name only since the early nineteenth centurywhen a monk, Dionisij—Dennis—lived, meditated, and left his graffiti here.1[part0050.html#note225] Before that the peoples of the Altai used to call itAju-Tasch, which means “Bear Rock.”2 [part0050.html#note226] We have no idea howfar that nomenclature may go back. It is certain, however, that Denisova Cavehas been used and occupied by various species of human for at least 280,000years, making it an unrivaled archive—a sort of “hall of records”—of our largelyunremembered ancestral story.3 [part0050.html#note227] Since excavations beganin 1977 it has proved to be a gift that just keeps on giving as archaeologistshave systematically combed out the secrets buried in its successive occupationlevels.4 [part0050.html#note228]At the risk of stating the obvious, in an archaeological excavation throughorderly and undisturbed stratigraphy of the kind that Denisova Cave generallyexhibits, the upper levels are the youngest and the lower levels getprogressively older the deeper down you dig. This, for example, is whyarchaeologists divide the period they call the Paleolithic (the “Old Stone Age,”dating from roughly 3 million years ago until 12,000 years ago) into the Lower,Middle, and Upper Paleolithic, with the latter conventionally dated between50,000 and 12,000 years ago.5 [part0050.html#note229]The first two trenches at Denisova Cave, both 4 meters deep, sliced down throughthe more recent levels and exposed artifacts beneath them dating back to theUpper Paleolithic. In the decades that followed these deposits proved to berich, various, and well preserved and the cave became recognized as aprehistoric locality of great importance.6 [part0050.html#note230] At certaintimes during the past 280,000 years, not continuously but at intervals, it hadbeen occupied by Neanderthals7 [part0050.html#note231]—our extinct cousins withwhom, as is now widely known, our ancestors interbred and from whom some extantmodern human populations have inherited as much as 1–4 percent of their DNA.8[part0050.html#note232] Neanderthals were probably still using the cave 50,000years ago. It wasn’t until 2010, however, when proof emerged that a humanspecies hitherto unrecognized by science had been present at Denisova—a speciesnow also known to have interbred with our ancestors9[part0050.html#note233]—that the true global significance of this very obscureand remote place could begin to be fully realized.The sensational news was broken first in the pages of Nature in December 2010 ina benchmark paper, “Genetic History of an Archaic Hominin Group from DenisovaCave in Siberia.”10 [part0050.html#note234] Coauthored by a stellar team ofbiomolecular engineers, geneticists, and biologists, with a couple ofanthropologists and archaeologists thrown in for good measure, the paperannounced the discovery of “the distal manual phalanx [i.e., the fingertip] of ajuvenile hominin. … The phalanx was found in layer 11, which has been dated to50,000 to 30,000 years ago. This layer contains microblades and body ornamentsof polished stone typical of the ‘Upper Palaeolithic industry’ generally thoughtto be associated with modern humans.”11 [part0050.html#note235]The big surprise, however, following a thorough analysis of DNA from thefingertip, was that it didn’t belong to an anatomically modern human, nor aNeanderthal, but to a species that had diverged from the common lineage leadingto anatomically modern humans and Neanderthals about 1 million years ago. Thispreviously unknown species was judged to be “a sister group to Neanderthals.”12[part0050.html#note236]PALEO-CSIDNA WAS ON MY MIND as we scrambled up to the cave because a good way to get togrips with the challenge of Denisova is to think of it as a crime scene—a veryold, neglected, contaminated, and long-unrecognized crime scene from which thephysical evidence is mostly gone apart from a few bones and teeth but where justenough genetic material might remain to help us figure out what happened there.Nonetheless, from the moment I entered the cave it impressed itself upon mefirst, foremost, and forcefully, as a sacred and mystical space. It facedroughly west, overlooking the steep slope leading down to the Anui River, andthat morning, as no doubt on many mornings over many thousands of years, thebrightness of the day outside was reflected back through the entrance toilluminate the spacious “Main Gallery” within. Looking up I saw that a narrownatural window opened in the ceiling 10 meters above the gallery’s west sideclose to the entrance, admitting more light but also no doubt in ancient timesserving as a chimney.I paused to breathe in the cave air, cool and moist, and to look around, struckby the way the bone-white walls, stained by lichen and covered in the uglyscrawl of recent graffiti that defaced almost every exposed surface, nonethelessgathered about themselves a kind of somber, ancient magnificence. The effect wasenhanced by soaring archways leading into the smaller, more intimate East andSouth Galleries, the side chapels to this prehistoric basilica. I deploy theanalogy deliberately because the Denisova Cave system does have a“cathedral-like” feel about it, but I do not claim that it was ever used forreligious or spiritual purposes. It may have been, but what the mass ofarchaeological evidence suggests is that for extraordinarily long periods oftime it functioned as a “factory” or “workshop,” and that raw materials werebrought here from far-off places to be worked and fashioned.This became clear during the brief visit we made to the Museum of the Peoples ofSiberia in Novosibirsk before setting out for Denisova Cave. Director IrinaSalnikova apologized that there was so little for us to see in the Denisova roomof her museum, explaining that much of the collection was away at exhibitions orin laboratories for further investigation. What she was able to show us,however, as well as many stone tools at various stages of refinement, fromextremely primitive to sophisticated, were some unusual and beautiful pieces ofjewelry including pendants featuring biconical drilled-out holes, cylindricalbeads, a ring carved from marble, a ring carved from mammoth ivory, and bonetubes perhaps designed to hold bone needles so they could be carried safely.13[part0050.html#note237]Many of the materials employed had been brought considerable distances to thecave,14 [part0050.html#note238] and now that I had reached the cave itself Icould see all three of the galleries in which they had been found and inspectthe open excavation trenches with little tacks and tags left in place to markthe various occupation levels. It was the gaping rectangular trench in thecenter of the Main Gallery, however—I would guess it was 5 meters deep, 4 meterslong, and 3 meters wide—that most clearly displayed Denisova’s amazing timemachine of stratification, with distinct Ice Age occupation levels numbered from9,15 [part0050.html#note239] the youngest, all the way down to 20, the oldest,right at the bottom.The excavation had descended farther here, down to Level 22, but the tacks andtags for these last two lower and older levels, visible on early reports of theprogress of archaeology in the cave,16 [part0050.html#note240] were no longerpresent. According to studies undertaken by the excavators, man-made tools andartifacts were found in these two exceedingly ancient layers, dated byradiothermoluminescence to between 155,000 and 282,000 years ago.17[part0050.html#note241] “The lithic [stone] industries recovered from strata 22and 21 are characterized by Levallois and parallel strategies of stonereduction; the tool kit is dominated by sidescrapers and notch-denticulatetools.”18 [part0050.html#note242]I knew that artifacts together with Neanderthal and Denisovan remains had beenrecovered in the excavations in all three galleries across multiple Paleolithicoccupation levels. That morning, however, my focus was particularly on Level 11in the East Gallery, where certain unusual and distinctive tools and pieces ofjewelery had been found.Some of these had the archaeologists scratching their heads.USUAL THINGS AND UNUSUAL THINGSANNOYINGLY, I HAD BEEN UNABLE to view these special items during my visit to theMuseum of the Peoples of Siberia. But I knew from my research that they’d beenretrieved, together with other more “normal” and “usual” objects, from an almostexclusively Denisovan occupation level of the East Gallery, nominated Level 11by the archaeologists and dated to the Upper Paleolithic between 29,200 and48,650 years ago.19 [part0050.html#note243]After the first Neanderthal skeletal remains were identified in Europe in thenineteenth century it was, for a very long while, one of the fundamentalunquestioned assumptions of archaeology, a matter taken to be self-evidentlytrue, that other “older,” “less-evolved” human species never attained, or evenin their wildest dreams could hope to aspire, to the same levels of culturaldevelopment as Homo sapiens. During more than a century of subsequent analysis,and despite multiple additional discoveries, the Neanderthals continued to bedepicted as nothing more than brutal, shambling, stupid subhumans—literallymorons by comparison with ourselves.20 [part0050.html#note244] Since thebeginning of the second decade of the twenty-first century, however, and withincreasing certainty as the evidence has become overwhelming, a new “image” ofthe Neanderthals as sensitive, intelligent, symbolic, and creative beingscapable of advanced thought processes and technological innovations has takenroot among archaeologists and is set to become the ruling paradigm.21[part0050.html#note245]There should be no objection in principle, therefore, to the notion that theanatomically archaic Denisovans, a close genetic “sister species” to theNeanderthals, might have been capable of creating the sorts of tools andsymbolic artifacts that, a few decades ago, would automatically have beenassumed to be the work of anatomically modern humans.Yet a difficulty arises.Among the more “unusual” and “unique” items excavated from the Paleolithicdeposits within the entrance zone of the East Gallery, specifically from Level11.1,22 [part0050.html#note246] were two broken pieces of a dark greenchloritolite bracelet. It would have measured 27-millimeter wide and9-millimeter thick when intact, with an original complete diameter of about 70millimeters.23 [part0050.html#note247] A detailed use-wear analysis of thebracelet was undertaken and revealed something odd: “This artifact wasmanufactured with the help of various technical methods of stone workingincluding those that are considered non-typical for the Paleolithic period. …The bracelet demonstrates a high level of technological skills.”24[part0050.html#note248]In their detailed scientific analysis published in the journal Archaeology,Ethnology and Anthropology of Eurasia, A. P. Derevianko, M. V. Shunkov, and P.V. Volkov draw our attention, in particular, to “a hole drilled close to one ofthe edges” of the bracelet and report that “drilling was carried out with astable drill over the course of at least three stages. Judging by traces on thesurface, the speed of drill running was considerable. Vibrations of the rotationaxis of the drill are minor, and the drill made multiple rotations around itsaxis.”25 [part0050.html#note249]They therefore conclude that the bracelet “constitutes unique evidence of anunexpectedly early employment of two-sided fast stationary drilling during theEarly Upper Paleolithic.”26 [part0050.html#note250]This is a big deal!What the investigators are getting at is how peculiar and misplaced in time thebracelet seems to be. It is not simply that it shows the application of skillsand technologies that are “unique for the Paleolithic”27 [part0050.html#note251](i.e., to state the matter plainly, skills and technologies that had neverbefore been seen in a Paleolithic context in any excavation) but also that atleast some of these skills and technologies, like “stationary drilling” with theuse of a bow drill that does not leave signs of drill vibration,28[part0050.html#note252] would not be seen again until the Neolithic manythousands of years later. The bracelet thus refutes what the authors describe as“a common assumption” held by archaeologists that “stone drilling originatedduring the Upper Paleolithic, but gained the features of a well-developedtechnology only during the Neolithic.”29 [part0050.html#note253]So not only was this curious bracelet unequivocally the work of anatomicallyarchaic human beings—the Denisovans—but also it testified to their mastery ofadvanced manufacturing techniques in the Upper Paleolithic, many millennia aheadof the earliest use of these techniques in the Neolithic by our own supposedly“advanced” species, Homo sapiens. Also made crystal clear was the realizationthat the Denisovans must have possessed the same kinds of artistic sensibilityand self-awareness that we habitually associate only with our own kind—for therecan be no doubt that very real, conscious, aware, and unmistakably human beingshad interacted with this bracelet at every stage of its conception, design, andmanufacture, all the way through to its end use.30 [part0050.html#note254]Though the outward structure of Denisovan skulls might have been ratherdifferent from ours (predictable for a “sister species” to the Neanderthals),the sense of style, design, and personal adornment manifested in the braceletseems completely modern, and archaeological reconstructions show it to have beena beautiful thing.Image Missing [../images/00038.jpeg]Reconstruction: The bracelet formed a torque, slipped sideways onto the wrist.Its calculated diameter of just 70 millimeters when intact would have made it“practically impossible to put even the thinnest hand into it.”31[part0050.html#note255] The most likely solution, however, since it undoubtedlywas worn, is that this stone bracelet originally took the form of a torque—notfully circling the wrist, but with a section removed: “The tips of the braceletwere likely cone-shaped. Such a shape of the ends of the bracelet makes it easyto put on a hand tangentially. … Judging by the size of the artifact and thesigns of extensive use-wear on the interior surface close to the end, thebracelet sat tightly on the wrist.”32 [part0050.html#note256]These signs included evidence of “long contact of the interior surface withhuman skin”33 [part0050.html#note257] and, more intimately, “remains of … fatfrom human skin”34 [part0050.html#note258]—details that reach across the agesand forge a poignant sense of connection. Indeed it dilates the imagination tocontemplate the identity of the person this bracelet was originally made for,who certainly—given the estimated diameter—must have had slim and gracefulwrists to wear it well. It is unlikely to have been the property of a childbecause of its rarity, artistry, and high value. As the investigators report:“It brightly shimmers in broad daylight and reveals a rich play of hunter greenshades in the light of a campfire. The bracelet was hardly an everyday item.Fragile and elegant, it was apparently worn on very special occasions. Given theutmost rarity of the material and the thorough finish, the bracelet was aprestigious ornament attesting to its owner’s high status.”35[part0050.html#note259]All in all, it seems a fair speculation that the slim-wristed person who ownedthis bracelet so many millennia ago was a woman. If so, whoever she was,whatever position of status she may have occupied, we can also guess that shehad quite an eye for beauty and a whimsical sense of style. A nice additionaldetail of the bracelet is that for a long while the drilled hole held a leatherstrap from which was suspended a pendant.36 [part0050.html#note260] Thoughneither the pendant nor the strap has survived, their presence left unmistakablepolish marks around the hole: “The polished area is limited suggesting that thependant was rather heavy and caused a strictly set amplitude of oscillation ofthe strap. The outlines of the polished area suggest the ‘up’ and ‘down’ sidesof the bracelet and allow us to assume that the bracelet was worn on the rightarm.”37 [part0050.html#note261]Again, there is that sense of contact, of intimacy, as though we’re separated byno more than a hair’s breadth from this ancient human. It must be admitted,however, that even here we’re speculating. We might not be dealing with a singleindividual at all. The bracelet might instead have been a treasured heirloom,passed down from mother to daughter across many generations.Whatever the truth is, it was eventually broken—not once but twice. On the firstoccasion the break was evidently accidental and it must still have beencherished because it was carefully repaired, literally put back together again,with some effective but as yet unidentified form of glue.38[part0050.html#note262]The second occasion was very different. It appears that the bracelet wasdeliberately smashed—we can only guess at the motive—“by a blow against a hardsurface.”39 [part0050.html#note263]THE EYE OF THE NEEDLETHE LOWER PART OF LEVEL 11 dates back, as we’ve seen, to around 50,000 yearsago, but the bracelet was found in the upper part, officially designated Level11.1 and provisionally dated to the Upper Paleolithic about 30,000 years ago40[part0050.html#note264]—making it, because of its “Neolithic” characteristics,roughly 20,000 years ahead of its time.41 [part0050.html#note265]The reader will understand, therefore, why it was one of the frustrations of ourtrip to Siberia in September 2017 that I was not able to see, nor Santha tophotograph, this enigmatic, intriguing, and profoundly out-of-place bracelet.Under normal circumstances it is kept at the Museum of the Peoples of Siberia inNovosibirsk, but as luck would have it, during our short visit there, it was outof town—indeed not only out of town but out of Siberia, out of Russia, and infact in Paris, where it had been on show in an exhibition. When I said we’dtravel there to see it, Irina Salnikova told us that it was no longer on publicview and was under investigation by “an international team of archaeologists.”42[part0050.html#note266]Gone with it was a second anomalous object, an exquisite bone needle 7.6centimeters in length, with a near-microscopic eye less than 1 millimeter indiameter drilled out at the head.43 [part0050.html#note267] Slightly curved likea modern surgical suture needle, it was excavated from the lower part of Level11 (Level 11.2) of the central chamber in the summer season of 2016.44[part0050.html#note268] No detailed analysis had been published before my visitto Novosibirsk in September 2017, but there was some coverage in the Russianmedia when the discovery was announced. “It is the most unique find of thisseason, which can even be called sensational,” commented Professor MichaelShunkov, coauthor of the report on the bracelet and director of the Institute ofArchaeology and Ethnography at the Russian Academy of Sciences.45[part0050.html#note269] His colleague Dr. Maxim Kozlikin added, “It’s thelongest needle found in Denisova Cave. We have found needles before, but inyounger archaeological layers.”46 [part0050.html#note270]He was referring specifically to the upper part of Level 11 where the braceletwas found and where, indeed, other smaller bone needles had also been excavatedsome years before.47 [part0050.html#note271] They, too, have fine drilled-outeyes of the type more usually seen in Neolithic than in Paleolithic deposits andprovided grounds for skeptics to suggest that the Denisovan dates might have tobe revised.48 [part0050.html#note272] The idea was floated that both thebracelet and the small needles must in fact be of Neolithic provenance but hadsomehow migrated downward through the deposits to end up in Level 11.1—astratum, from the skeptical point of view, in which they were “obviously” tooadvanced and “untypical” to belong.What put an end to such speculation was the discovery of the longer, even finerand more technically perfect needle in 2016 and its location not in theupper—younger—part of Level 11 near its contact with Level 10, but instead inthe much older lower part near its contact with Level 12. As we’ve seen, thislower part of Level 11 has been dated by accelerated mass spectrometry to around50,000 years before the present49 [part0050.html#note273] (although it may bemore ancient, given that 50,000 years is the limit of radiocarbon dating).By the second half of 2016, therefore, far from proving younger as some hadexpected, the mysterious artifacts of Denisova Cave were beginning to look likethey were much, much older. This impression was confirmed in 2017 with ashocking announcement. Level 11 had been reassessed and its various internalstrata reexamined and re-dated. The result of these new investigations was thatthe bracelet was no longer thought to be 30,000 years old as had originally beensupposed, but 50,000 years old!50 [part0050.html#note274]Image Missing [../images/00039.jpeg]This exquisite bone needle 7.6 centimeters in length, with a near-microscopiceye less than 1 millimeter in diameter drilled out at the head, was found atDenisova Cave in 2016. PHOTO: INSTITUTE OF ARCHAEOLOGY AND ETHNOGRAPHY, SIBERIANBRANCH, RUSSIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.A year later the Siberian Times published speculation that it might be evenolder—perhaps as much as “65,000 to 70,000 years old.”51 [part0050.html#note275]Professor Shunkov did not welcome the speculation and pointed out that the greatantiquity of the bracelet was already a matter of global significance, withimmense implications for the way archaeologists look at the past.52[part0050.html#note276] He wasn’t about to commit to an older date before allthe relevant experts had reached consensus. “Until then, I will refrain fromsaying anything,” he explained, adding that some data was “ambiguous” andrequired clarification. “If or when we agree, we will have to prepare apublication first.”53 [part0050.html#note277]I could understand his caution. It was the same sort of caution, for pretty muchthe same reasons, as Tom Deméré had felt for so long before presenting hiscontroversial evidence and conclusions about the Cerutti Mastodon Site in thepages of Nature. With discoveries like these that have the potential to disruptyears of comfortable scientific consensus it pays to take care, and to preparethe ground, before you go public.Persistent rumors filter out of paradigm-busting new discoveries concerning theDenisovans and “multiple big headlines coming up.”54 [part0050.html#note278]Meanwhile that beautiful and haunting cave in the Siberian Altai was still, as Iwrite these words in 2018, the only place on earth where physical remains ofDenisovans have been confirmed.55 [part0050.html#note279] Those so far recoveredare few in number, but such are the wonders of genetic science that thefingertip we spoke of earlier, some teeth, some additional bone fragments, andeven some dust from the cave floor allow us to be quite sure that Denisovanswere in occupation here at least as early as 170,000 years ago and that theycame back 110,000 years ago and again around 50,000 years ago.56[part0050.html#note280]Just like the Neanderthals who overlapped with our ancestors and interbred withthem, so, too, the Denisovans overlapped the Neanderthals and interbred withthem while also, again like the Neanderthals, interbreeding with anatomicallymodern humans. Viable offspring capable of reproduction resulted from all theseliaisons and in August 2018, Denisova Cave obliged yet again by yielding up abone fragment, more than 50,000 years old and in sufficiently good condition forgenome sequencing. It turned out to have belonged to a female, about 13 years ofage, who had a Neanderthal mother and a Denisovan father.57[part0050.html#note281]In consequence of such liaisons it’s a tricky business, tens of thousands ofyears later, to unravel the tangle of inheritance—with gene flow going in bothdirections between Neanderthals and Denisovans, Neanderthals and anatomicallymodern humans, and Denisovans and anatomically modern humans. Thus, whereDenisovan DNA is found in human populations today (to give just a single exampleof the sorts of difficulties faced), researchers must be alert to thepossibility that it may not have come directly from a Denisovan but via aNeanderthal who had inherited DNA from an earlier tryst, perhaps dozens ofgenerations back, between a Neanderthal and a Denisovan. Multiple otherbewildering combinations are also possible, but using powerful computersgeneticists are able to disentangle this cat’s-cradle of intertwining genes andlives.What now appears to be certain is that Neanderthals, Homo sapiens (as modernhumans are classified taxonomically), and Denisovans all shared and descendedfrom a common ancestor a million years or so ago.58 [part0050.html#note282] Thedivergence of the Neanderthal line from the modern human line began at least430,000 years ago, and perhaps as early as 765,000 years ago.59[part0050.html#note283] The divergence of the Neanderthal line from theDenisovan line occurred between 381,000 and 473,000 years ago.60[part0050.html#note284] Humans today are therefore, to a greater or lesserdegree, hybrids who have inherited genes from Neanderthals, Denisovans, andarchaic Homo sapiens.CROSSING THE LINETHE MODERN INHABITANTS OF THE Altai are notable in that they have inheritedvirtually no Denisovan DNA at all—just a tiny fraction of a single percent.61[part0050.html#note285] By contrast, the human populations with the highestpercentage of Denisovan DNA today are found among “geographically isolated NewGuinean and Australian aborigines (in the range of 3–4%).”62[part0050.html#note286]The first detailed investigation went a little higher than this in some cases,concluding, for example, that the archaic Denisovan population “contributed 4–6%of its genetic material to the genomes of present-day Melanesians.”63[part0050.html#note287] Subsequently, varying levels of Denisovan admixture havealso been identified in populations from eastern Indonesia, the Philippines,Near and Remote Oceania, and the Americas.64 [part0050.html#note288]At first this widespread heritage seems strange in view of the location ofDenisova Cave itself, deep in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia, thousandsof miles from New Guinea and Australia and even farther from the Americas. Buttens of millennia have passed since the Denisovans occupied the cave,occasionally interbreeding with Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans andpassing on their genes through all kinds of convoluted liaisons and migrations.We don’t even know—on the most recent evidence it seems unlikely—that the cavewas in any way central to the Denisovan range. It could equally well have beensome peripheral outpost and indeed a number of scientists, notable among themAlan Cooper of the University of Adelaide and Christopher Stringer of London’sNatural History Museum, have made a case that the ancient Denisovan homeland wasnot in Siberia, or indeed in Asia at all, but instead lay “east of Wallace’sLine.”65 [part0050.html#note289]A deep oceanic trough, notorious for its fast-flowing currents, Wallace’s Linedivides Asia to its west from Australia to its east. It is rightly recognized as“one of the world’s biggest biogeographic disjunctions”66[part0050.html#note290] and even during the lowered sea levels of the last IceAge it would always have confronted migrants seeking to travel in eitherdirection with a challenging maritime crossing. Any who undertook it must notonly have been intrepid explorers of unknown realms and lands, but must alsohave possessed sufficient sailing and navigational skills to cross 30 kilometersof deep and sometimes turbulent open water between Bali and Lombok and, in thecase of those who reached Papua New Guinea and Australia, to cross again thewider gulf of the Timor Straits—a formidable barrier of 90 kilometers of openwater even at times of lowest sea level.Coupled with the presence very far to the west in Siberia of Denisovan artifactsas well as Denisovan physical remains yielding a fully sequenced genome, theprominent Denisovan genetic signal among Australian aborigines and Melanesianscannot be explained without invoking these open-water crossings. In remoteantiquity somebody was certainly undertaking them, and in the process spreadingDenisovan genes. What we don’t know yet is whether this gene flow was the resultof direct interbreeding with the Denisovans themselves, or with some perhaps asyet unidentified people whose own heritage included a significant admixture ofDenisovan genes.We also don’t know, and can only guess, at the location of the lost homeland ofthe Denisovans. Was it east of Wallace’s Line, as Cooper and Stringer haveargued? Or might it not just as well have been west of the Line on the plainsand savannas of the exposed Sunda Shelf during the lowered sea levels of thelast Ice Age when the Malaysian peninsula and the islands of Sumatra, Java, andBorneo all formed one continuous landmass?67 [part0050.html#note291]Wherever it was, we know that 90 kilometers of open water was no barrier tothese people—so why not farther? Why should they not even have crossed to theother side of the Pacific Ocean, making landfall in the Americas?"},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00040.jpeg]THE STRANGE AND MYSTERIOUS GENETIC HERITAGE OF NATIVE AMERICANSBY NO MEANS FULLY UNDERSTOOD yet despite the best efforts of Darwin and hissuccessors, the process we call “evolution” combines continuous change withcontinuous conservation in an endless, swirling, bewildering dance of almostunbelievable intricacy. Zoom in at sufficiently high resolution to the DNA thatchoreographs this dance, however, and certain distinct and identifiable patternsbegin to emerge. Because we are all members of a single human family, thesepatterns can then be used to establish the degree of relatedness—and thus totrack the prehistoric migrations and liaisons—of seemingly disparatepopulations, even if they now reside on opposite sides of the globe. It’s anendeavor of great technical complexity, deploying the latest advances intwenty-first-century genomic science, but it reveals previously hidden clues tothe lost story of our past and—potentially—offers us a way out of the culturalamnesia that has erased tens of thousands of years of ancestral experiences fromour collective memory.This is not a genetics textbook and I don’t want us to get bogged down insuperfluous details, but here are some essentials we’ll need going forward: 1. DNA is the genetic mechanism of inheritance, and the various types of DNA present in our cells have, as a result of scientific advances in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, been subject to close investigation by a range of highly sophisticated techniques.1 [part0050.html#note292] The results of these investigations have shed light on the degree of genetic relatedness that exists between individuals and, on a larger scale, between entire populations.2 [part0050.html#note293] 2. Located in the fluid surrounding the nucleus of every cell in our bodies, mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) is inherited by both males and females but is passed on to offspring only by females.3 [part0050.html#note294] MtDNA can identify lines of descent from shared maternal, but not paternal, ancestors.4 [part0050.html#note295] What geneticists like about mtDNA is its abundance, being present in multiple copies per cell, giving plenty of material to work with.5 [part0050.html#note296] 3. The same cannot be said of nuclear DNA, inherited equally from both parents, which has only two copies per cell but which encodes far more genetic information than mtDNA, allowing for far more robust and precise analyses of genetic relatedness.6 [part0050.html#note297] 4. Within the cell nucleus are also located the chromosomes—segments of DNA that determine sex. If you have two X chromosomes you’re a female; if you have an X and a Y you’re male. Y-DNA is passed on only by males, thus facilitating the determination only of shared paternal ancestry, whereas X-DNA is inherited both through the maternal and paternal lines (since males and females both have X chromosomes) and can therefore be useful in isolating shared common ancestors along particular branches of inheritance.7 [part0050.html#note298]Is it important to understand the technicalities of DNA and DNA analysis as ameans of establishing degrees of relatedness?By all means dig deeper if you wish to, for this whole area of science is afascinating one. But don’t feel you have to—any more, for example, than youmight feel you must master plumbing in order to run water from a tap, or theintricacies of mechanical engineering in order to drive a car, or medicalstudies before undergoing surgery.In other words, genetics, unlike archaeology, is a hard science where thepronouncements of experts are based on facts, measurements, and replicableexperimentation rather than inferences or preconceived opinions. Mistakes aremade by geneticists, of course, and profound disagreements are routinelythrashed out between colleagues in the professional journals. By and large,however, just as we trust the engineer, or the plumber, or the surgeon for theirspecialized knowledge (even though they sometimes get things wrong), it willstreamline matters greatly here if we trust the conclusions of specialistsworking with the latest high-tech tools at the cutting edge of analysis ofancient DNA.TWO SITES, TWO FAMILIES, ONE HUMAN RACEMIND YOU, “SHOTGUN SEQUENCING” OF long strands of DNA and other similarlyesoteric technologies are not required for us to connect—at a basic humanlevel—with the story of our ancestors. Particularly poignant examples of what Imean here are provided at two ancient sites, one in Siberia and one in Montana.The Siberian site lies to the west of Lake Baikal near the village of Mal’ta onthe banks of the Bolshaya Belaya River. As the crow flies (and a great dealfarther on foot through winding valleys and over high passes) this is a locationmore than 1,000 kilometers east of Denisova Cave. Its reach back into the humanpast does not extend as far as Denisova’s. Still it has been recognized for manyyears as the home of an Upper Paleolithic culture—archaeologists call it theMal’ta-Buret culture—that left behind many beautiful and mysterious works of artthought to be more than 20,000 years old.8 [part0050.html#note299] Among them,done in bone and mammoth ivory, are carvings of elegant, long-necked water fowland a collection of thirty human Venus figures that are “rare for Siberia butfound at a number of Upper Paleolithic sites across western Eurasia.”9[part0050.html#note300]The primary excavations at Mal’ta, which took place between 1928 and 1958,10[part0050.html#note301] also uncovered two burials, both of young childreninterred with curious and beautiful grave goods including pendants, badges, andornamental beads.11 [part0050.html#note302] One of these children, a boy aged3–4 years and now known to archaeologists as MA-I, had been buried beneath astone slab, there was a Venus figurine beside him,12 [part0050.html#note303] andhe was “wearing an ivory diadem, a bead necklace and a bird-shaped pendant.”13[part0050.html#note304] Traces of pigmentation were found on his bones,14[part0050.html#note305] which presently reside in the Hermitage State Museum inSt. Petersburg, where a high-level international team of investigators,prominently featuring geneticists and evolutionary biologists, paid them a visitin 2009. The scientists drilled out a number of small samples from the bones andsubjected them to accelerator mass spectrometry C-14 dating that showed them,give or take a few hundred years, to be 24,000 years old.15[part0050.html#note306] Detailed tests were then carried out on the samples andin due course the investigators announced that they had successfully sequencedMA-1’s entire genome—making it, when a full account of the investigation waspublished in Nature in 2014, “the oldest anatomically modern human genomereported to date.”16 [part0050.html#note307]We’ll consider the implications of what was found in context also of the secondsite I mentioned above—located in Montana. Known to archaeologists as theAnzick-1 burial site and dated to 12,600 years ago (which makes it 11,400 yearsyounger than MA-1), it is also a child’s grave—in this case a boy aged 1–2 yearswho was interred with more than 100 tools of stone and antler, all sprinkledwith red ochre.17 [part0050.html#note308]One thing we see for sure in both these ancient burials, separated by thousandsof miles and thousands of years, is that the human capacity to love and cherishfamily members, and to regret and mourn those who pass prematurely, is notdiminished by time; indeed, we instantly recognize and identify with it todaybecause we share it. For convenience we’ll continue to use the ratherdehumanizing archaeological labels “MA-1” and “Anzick-1” here. But let’s notforget the bereaved parents and family members as they gathered around thosegravesides 24,000 years ago in Siberia and 12,600 years ago in Montana, and thecare and thought, the symbolism and emotions, the love and the aching sense ofloss that went into the careful preparation of the graves and the choice andplacing of the grave goods in both cases.Across the ages and regardless of geography, in everything that really matters,it bears repeating that we are all members of a SINGLE human family—a family ofintrepid adventurers who have been exploring the world in one form or anotherfor the best part of a million years.18 [part0050.html#note309] In the course ofthis long odyssey we’ve moved so far apart, across oceans, over mountains, andto the opposite ends of jungles, deserts, and ice caps that we’ve forgotten howclosely related we in fact are. In this sense, like the simple human message ofthe burials, the message of genetics also speaks to a hidden unity within ourapparent diversity—and sometimes in ways that defy our expectations.ANCIENT EUROPEAN GENESFEW HAVE COMMENTED ON THE obvious cultural similarities in burial practices, butas to genetics, all authorities agree that MA-1 and Anzick-1 are closelyrelated, sharing large sequences of DNA.19 [part0050.html#note310] Anzick-1,however, “belonged to a population directly ancestral to many contemporaryNative Americans” and thus, unsurprisingly—despite his proximity to MA-1—is“more closely related to all indigenous American populations than to any othergroup.”20 [part0050.html#note311]Just as it was for so long an article of faith that the Americas were peopledexclusively by migrations from Siberia across the Bering land bridge, so, too,it was held to be self-evident that those Siberian migrants must have been mostclosely related to east Asians.21 [part0050.html#note312] What did the Beringland bridge do, after all, if not connect the far northeast of Asia with the farnorthwest of North America?But a surprise awaited the investigative team led by Maanasa Raghavan of theCentre for GeoGenetics at Denmark’s Natural History Museum and Pontus Skoglundof Harvard Medical School’s Department of Genetics. Instead of confirming theanticipated connection to east Asia, MA-1’s Y chromosome (the male sexchromosome) turned out to be “basal to modern-day western Eurasians.”22[part0050.html#note313] We have mentioned the limitations of Y-chromosomeanalysis already, so it is good—and raises the confidence level all around—thatthis unanticipated and potentially boat-rocking finding was subsequentlyconfirmed with autosomal evidence23 [part0050.html#note314] (the best kind ofDNA evidence, derived from the nucleus of the cell). “MA-1,” the investigatorsrepeat and reemphasize, “is basal to modern-day western Eurasians … with noclose affinity to east Asians.”24 [part0050.html#note315]Moreover—and most intriguingly—the investigators discovered that MA-1 alsostands “near the root of most Native American lineages,”25[part0050.html#note316] and “14 to 38% of Native American ancestry may originatethrough gene flow from this ancient population [the population from which MA-1stemmed]. This is likely to have occurred after the divergence of NativeAmerican ancestors from east Asian ancestors, but before the diversification ofNative American populations in the New World.”26 [part0050.html#note317]The final link in the chain of evidence emerged when MA-1’s mitochondrial genomewas sequenced, revealing the Siberian infant to be a member of “haplogroup U,which has also been found at high frequency among Upper Paleolithic andMesolithic European hunter-gatherers.”27 [part0050.html#note318]“Our result,” the investigators conclude, “therefore suggests a connectionbetween pre-agricultural Europe and Upper Paleolithic Siberia.”28[part0050.html#note319]A genetic consequence of this previously unsuspected European/Siberian nexus,since as much as 38 percent of Native American ancestry is attributable to geneflow from MA-1’s people, is that Native American DNA carries a strong and veryancient “European” signal.29 [part0050.html#note320]HIDDEN SOUTH AMERICAN ORIGINS OF CLOVIS REVEALEDSOMETHING I HAVEN’T MENTIONED YET—the ochre-dusted stone and antler tools foundburied with Anzick-1 were unmistakably Clovis artifacts.30[part0050.html#note321]There are two reasons why this “Clovis connection” is particularly noteworthyand relevant to our quest.First, the Anzick-1 burial was originally dated to around 12,600 years ago—or,more exactly, within the limits of resolution of C-14, to between 12,707 and12,556 years ago.31 [part0050.html#note322] This suggested that the grave wasdug and the grave goods placed with the remains of the deceased infant a centuryor two after the abrupt and mysterious disappearance of the Clovis culture fromthe archaeological record around 12,800 years ago.That disappearance testifies to a sudden cessation of previously widespreadcultural activities, suggestive of interruption by some far-reaching cataclysmicevent. What it does not mean, however, is that every member of the Clovispopulation died out overnight. Even if most did there would, undoubtedly, havebeen survivors—small groups coalescing into scattered, wandering tribes, whosemembers might have looked back on the achievements of their ancestors with awe.One possibility that has been considered is that Anzick-1 himself may havebelonged to just such a remnant group. This possibility was raised after a smallbut significant discrepancy was found between the dates of Anzick-1’s bones andthe dates of certain artifacts buried with him.The artifacts, known as “foreshafts,” are specially cut, shaped, and hollowedsections of red deer antler, each designed to hold a projectile point at one endand to clamp onto the tip of a wooden spear shaft at the other. As we’ve seen,Anzick-1’s bones were initially dated between 12,707 and 12,556 years ago. Theantler foreshafts among his grave goods are a century or two older than that—inthe range of 12,800 to 13,000 years ago32 [part0050.html#note323]—“a much moretypical and acceptable age for Clovis,” as archaeologist Stuart J. Fiedelobserves, than the “age attributed to the infant’s bones.”33[part0050.html#note324]To resolve the discrepancy, Fiedel offers a simple but insightful reading of theevidence. The discordant data, he speculates in a paper published in QuaternaryInternational in June 2017, would be reconciled if “the foreshafts were 100 to200-year-old antique heirlooms interred with the infant by the very last Clovisfolks in the region.”34 [part0050.html#note325]Alternatively he suggests that due to contamination of the sample, “the infantbone dates may be slightly too young.”35 [part0050.html#note326]A number of other researchers seized on the apparent temporal discrepancy todiscount Anzick-1 as a Clovis individual,36 [part0050.html#note327] but Fiedel’scomment on contamination proved prescient. In June 2018, a year after hisQuaternary International paper, a new study by scientists at the OxfordRadiocarbon Accelerator Unit was published in Proceedings of the NationalAcademy of Sciences (PNAS) under the headline “Reassessing the Chronology of theArchaeological Site of Anzick.”37 [part0050.html#note328] The study reminds usthat “in radiocarbon dating, contamination can be a major source of error” butadds that “methodological improvements” since the original dating work at Anzickwas done “have seen a significant effect in dating accuracy and reliability.”38[part0050.html#note329] After applying these new methods the study concludes,contrary to previous findings, that “Anzick-1 is temporally coeval with thedated antler rods. This implies that the individual is indeed temporallyassociated with the Clovis assemblage.”39 [part0050.html#note330]We’ll return to the mysterious end of the Clovis culture in later chapters.Meanwhile there’s a second reason why Anzick-1’s “Clovis connection” is ofimmediate relevance to our quest here—which is that although Clovis did, at thelimits of its range, extend into some northern areas of South America, itsheartland was in North America.40 [part0050.html#note331] Intuitively,therefore, we would expect the Montana infant, a Clovis individual, to be muchmore closely related to Native North Americans than to Native South Americans.Further investigations, however, while reconfirming that Anzick-1’s genome had agreater affinity to all Native Americans than to any extant Eurasianpopulation,41 [part0050.html#note332] revealed it to be much more closelyrelated to native South Americans than to Native North Americans! 42[part0050.html#note333]Morten Rasmussen of Denmark’s Centre for GeoGenetics and Pontus Skoglund of theDepartment of Genetics at Harvard Medical School seek to explain the anomaly byarguing that the ancestors of the First Americans must have split into twoseparate groups—they label them “the NA and SA lineages”—before entering theAmericas, “with the Anzick-1 individual belonging to the SA lineage.”43[part0050.html#note334]That seems reasonable enough on the face of things until we stop to consider thespectacle of these two groups, sharing common ancestry but already geneticallydistinct, racing into the Americas on parallel and nonconverging tracks, oneheading straight for South America, the other staying in North America—yetnever, throughout this process, making sufficiently enduring contact with oneanother to compromise their separateness or leave a trace in the genetic record.This seems to deny human nature and simply doesn’t make sense in lots of wayseven before we get to the fact that Anzick-1, the most ancient representative ofthe “SA lineage” so far studied by science,44 [part0050.html#note335] wasn’tfound anywhere near South America but in North America and, indeed, in Montana,which, 12,600 years ago, was about as far north as you could get before you hitthe great Cordilleran ice sheet.A PECULIAR SIGNAL FROM DOWN UNDERIN SUMMARY, ANZICK-1 IS A paradox clothed in a conundrum, wrapped up in amystery—an individual in a North American Clovis culture grave who is closelyrelated to Native South Americans, to the Siberian Mal’ta population, and toancient western Europeans. Because the South American lineage to which hebelonged shared a common ancestor with the North American lineage, thegeneticists found nothing in the data to challenge their long-held view that thesettlement of the Americas, both North and South, had been accomplished fromnortheast Asia by a single founding population—albeit one that divided itselfinto two streams.A year later, however, in September 2015, Pontus Skoglund, his senior colleagueProfessor David Reich of the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School,and other leading experts in the field announced in the pages of Nature thatthey had found new evidence in South America, and specifically in the Amazonrainforest, that called for a rethink:Here we analyse genome-wide data to show that some Amazonian Native Americansdescend partly from a Native American founding population that carried ancestrymore closely related to indigenous Australians, New Guineans and AndamanIslanders than to any present-day Eurasians or Native Americans. This signatureis not present to the same extent, or at all, in present-day Northern andCentral Americans or in a 12,600-year-old Clovis-associated genome, suggesting amore diverse set of founding populations of the Americas than previouslyaccepted.45 [part0050.html#note336]We’ve already done the groundwork on the “12,600-year-old Clovis-associatedgenome” the researchers speak of here. The reference, of course, is to Anzick-1,that paradoxical infant, swaddled in mystery, who we know was more closelyrelated to Native South Americans than to Native North Americans. What the newstudy adds to this is that there was a previously unsuspected structure withinthe SA lineage, including at least one sub-lineage—to which Anzick-1 did notbelong—that was more closely related to Melanesian Papuans and AustralianAborigines than to any extant Native American population.Image Missing [../images/00041.jpeg]South Americans, notably in the Amazon rainforest, share ancestry withAustralasian and Melanesian populations not seen in Mesoamericans or NorthAmericans. (After Nature, “Genetic Evidence for Two Founding Populations of theAmericas,” September 3, 2015).There is no trace of this lineage in most modern Native Americans, and—it’sworth driving this point home—no trace either in the ancestral populationrepresented by Anzick-1. Nevertheless, the investigators continued to beconfronted by a peculiar and distinctive “Australasian signal,” showing geneticrelatedness to “indigenous groups in Australia, Melanesia, and island SoutheastAsia,”46 [part0050.html#note337] calling attention to itself in the genomes ofNative Americans from the heart of the Amazon jungle. The Surui and Karitianatribes, speaking languages belonging to the Tupi family, proved to have apeculiarly close connection to Australasians, as did the Ge-speaking Xavante ofthe central Brazilian plateau.47 [part0050.html#note338]Such a signal was completely unexpected given the vast distance betweenAustralasia and the Amazon and the absence of any overland DNA trail. Skoglundand Reich therefore subjected it to particularly rigorous testing, applying fourdifferent methods of statistical analysis to compare the genomes of 30 Centraland South American peoples with the genomes of 197 other populations from aroundthe world.48 [part0050.html#note339] “We spent a really long time trying to makethis result go away,” Skoglund explained, “but it just got stronger.”49[part0050.html#note340]In the end “a statistically clear signal linking Native Americans in theAmazonian region of Brazil to present-day Australo-Melanesians and AndamanIslanders” was confirmed.50 [part0050.html#note341]“It’s incredibly surprising,” commented David Reich. “There’s a strong workingmodel in archaeology and genetics, of which I have been a proponent, that mostNative Americans today extend from a single pulse of expansion south of the icesheets—and that’s wrong. We missed something very important in the originaldata.”51 [part0050.html#note342]What was missed, Reich and Skoglund argue, was nothing less than thefingerprints of a lost lineage—a second founding population of the Americas. Itis very old,52 [part0050.html#note343] in their view, and almost all traces ofit have been overwritten almost everywhere by later genetic “noise.” That we canstill detect it at all among isolated peoples in the Amazon is probably becausetheir genomes have been subject to less admixture and introgression than most.The investigators have given their “putative ancient Native American lineage” aname: “Population Y” after Ypykuéra, which means “ancestor” in the Tupi languagefamily.”53 [part0050.html#note344]And they come to a very clear, if tantalizing, conclusion: “A Population Y thathad ancestry from a lineage more closely related to present-day Australasiansthan to present-day East Asians and Siberians likely contributed to the DNA ofNative Americans from Amazonia and the Central Brazilian Plateau.”54[part0050.html#note345]But how, when, and where did this contribution occur?One possibility that Skoglund and Reich consider is that the patterns of genomicvariation of present-day Amazonians could be explained if a large proportion—upto 85 percent—of their ancestry derived “from a population that existed in asubstructured northeast Asia, and was similar to the main lineage that gave riseto other Native Americans while retaining more Australasian affinity.”55[part0050.html#note346]In other words, congregating in that original northeast Asian—that is,Siberian—melting pot we are now being asked to envisage not only people withEuropean genes and people with east Asian genes, but also people withAustralasian genes. Neanderthals were part of the mix, too, interbreedingvigorously with Homo sapiens, and there were people carrying Denisovan genes andof course the Denisovans themselves. We’re asked to see these groups asessentially divided and separate from one another—despite the obvious evidenceof their liaisons—and we’re asked to accept that they remained divided andseparate, already conveniently prearranging themselves into what would becomethe “NA” and “SA” lineages, as they trekked across the Bering land bridge.The endlessly flexible boundaries of such an improbable model seem perfectlyadapted to explain away any potentially boat-rocking data. It’s not surprising,therefore, to find a hermetically sealed and hitherto invisible “Australasianlineage” being tacked on to the mongrel pedigree of the First Americans as soonas the inconvenient presence of Australasian genes in the midst of the Amazonjungle needed to be explained and normalized. Nor is it surprising to see thehypothetical “Population Y,” identified as the bearer of those genes, depictedas heading straight to South America to oblige without leaving any of its DNAalong the way among the North American populations with which it would surelyhave had to mingle.Perhaps because of the impracticality of some of these ideas, Skoglund and Reichconclude with an offbeat alternative. “The patterns of genomic variation ofpresent-day Amazonians,” they point out, seemingly off the cuff, could also beexplained “by as little as 2% admixture from an Australasian-related population,that would thus have penetrated deep inside the Americas without mixing with themain ancestral lineage of present-day Native Americans.”56[part0050.html#note347]In other words, on this view, what has been preserved in those isolated,unadulterated Amazonian genomes that speaks to an ancient connection withAustralasia might not be the traces of a full-scale migration but something morelike a one-off settlement by a relatively small group.In the next chapter we’ll consider the profound implications of this scenariofor our understanding of American prehistory."},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00042.jpeg]A SIGNAL FROM THE DREAMTIME?SKOGLUND AND REICH’S PAPER IN Nature reporting the presence of Australasiangenes in certain populations in the Amazon is titled “Genetic Evidence for TwoFounding Populations of the Americas.”1 [part0050.html#note348] It was firstpublished online on July 21, 2015 (ahead of the print edition, which appeared onSeptember 3, 2015).On precisely the same day (before appearing in print in the journal Science onAugust 21, 2015), another team of researchers, led by Maanasa Raghavan and EskeWillerslev, both of the Centre for GeoGenetics at the University of Copenhagen,published the online version of a paper titled “Genomic Evidence for thePleistocene and Recent Population History of Native Americans.”2[part0050.html#note349] Unlike Skoglund and Reich, who see two founderpopulations in the data, Raghavan and Willerslev see only one, arriving in “asingle migration wave from Siberia no earlier than 23 thousand years ago andafter no more than an 8000-year isolation period in Beringia.”3[part0050.html#note350]Raghavan and Willerslev several times drive home the point that the data theypresent “are consistent with a single initial migration of all NativeAmericans”4 [part0050.html#note351] along a route from Siberia via Beringia andthat “from that single migration, there was a diversification of ancestralNative Americans leading to the formation of northern and southern branches.”5[part0050.html#note352]This is all very neat, tidy, and in certain ways reassuring for those Americanarchaeologists—a majority—still reeling from posttraumatic shock following thecollapse of the Clovis First dogma. Of course they would have to be in a stateof rigid and unyielding denial to continue to shrug off the perfect storm ofevidence from genetics and from sites like Topper, Cactus Hill, and Monte Verdethat relegated Clovis to the trash can of history. But at least their favoredroute—from Siberia, across the Bering land bridge—remains intact and not onlythat, but Raghavan and Willerslev’s paper also endorses the currentlyfashionable “Beringian standstill” model.If only the geneticists had ended their paper there, archaeological contentmentwith it would have been complete. However, because they are good scientists,Raghavan and Willerslev—just like Skoglund and Reich—could not ignore thepersistent “Australasian signal” that kept cropping up in the data:We found that some American populations—including the Aleutian Islanders, Surui,and Athabascans—are closer to Australo-Melanesians as compared with other NativeAmericans, such as North American Ojibwa, Cree, and Algonquin and the SouthAmerican Purepecha, Arhuaco, and Wayuu. The Surui are, in fact, one of theclosest Native American populations to East Asians and Australo-Melanesians, thelatter including Papuans, non-Papuan Melanesians, Solomon Islanders, and SouthEast Asian hunter-gatherers such as Aeta.6 [part0050.html#note353]As we’ve seen in previous chapters, the archaeological mainstream is anintensely conservative and territorial scholarly community, resistant to change,whose deeply embedded prejudices deny that our “Stone Age” ancestors could havepossessed anything other than the most primitive and rudimentary technologicalabilities. For orthodox thinkers, it is literally inconceivable that prehistoricsettlers from the general vicinity of Papua New Guinea could have crossed theentire width of the Pacific Ocean to South America, and thence made their way tothe Amazon to leave evidence of their presence in the DNA of people still livingthere today.What’s paradoxical about this position is that—admittedly after a hard-foughtstruggle—no one in the mainstream now would seriously dispute that our ancienthominid ancestors were capable of undertaking successful open-water voyages tocolonize new lands.7 [part0050.html#note354] We’ve seen how the presence ofDenisovan DNA on both sides of the Timor Straits and both east and west of theWallace Line confirms that migrations across stretches of open water up to 90kilometers wide were indeed taking place at least 60,000 years ago—a positionalready supported by a mass of other evidence.8 [part0050.html#note355]Likewise, and significantly earlier, bones and artifacts of Homo erectus datedto 800,000 years before the present have been found on the Indonesian islands ofFlores and Timor, again making open-water crossings by these supposed“subhumans” a certainty even during periods of lowered sea level.9[part0050.html#note356]All of this has long ago been conceded. Despite the passage of close to amillion years since Homo erectus first sailed to Flores, however, whatarchaeology does not concede is that the human species could have developed andrefined those early nautical skills to the extent of being able to cross a vastocean like the Pacific or the Atlantic from one side to the other. In the caseof the former, extensive transoceanic journeys are not believed to have beenundertaken until about 3,500 years ago, during the so-called Polynesianexpansion.10 [part0050.html#note357] And the mainstream historical view is thatthe Atlantic was not successfully navigated until 1492—the year in which, as theschoolyard mnemonic has it, “Columbus sailed the ocean blue.”Indeed, the notion that long transoceanic voyages were a technologicalimpossibility during the Stone Age remains one of the central structuralelements of the dominant reference frame of archaeology11[part0050.html#note358]—a reference frame that geneticists see no reason not torespect and deploy when interpreting their own data. Since that reference framerules out, a priori, the option of a direct ocean crossing between Australasiaand South America during the Paleolithic and instead is adamant that allsettlement came via northeast Asia, geneticists tend to approach the data fromthat perspective.This is the case with Raghavan and Willerslev. First, as we’ve seen, theyconcede the presence within the data of “a distant Old-World signal related toAustralo-Melanesians and East Asians in some Native Americans.”12[part0050.html#note359] But, second, they go on to downplay the implications ofthis with the following interpretation:The widely scattered and differential affinity of Native Americans to theAustralo-Melanesians, ranging from a strong signal in the Surui to a much weakersignal in northern Amerindians such as Ojibwa, points to this gene flowoccurring after the initial peopling by Native American ancestors.13[part0050.html#note360]Here’s how they arrive at this interpretation of the data: 1. They trace the source of the strong Australasian signal in the Amazon to “gene flow”—the transfer of genetic variation from one population to another.14 [part0050.html#note361] 2. They propose that this gene flow reached Amazonian peoples such as the Surui from northern Amerindian populations such as the Aleutian Islanders and the Athabascans, and they appear to favor particularly a “route via the Aleutian Islanders,” since the latter “were previously found to be closely related to the Inuit who have a relatively greater affinity to East Asians, Oceanians, and Denisovans than Native Americans.”15 [part0050.html#note362] They hypothesize that the “complex genetic history” of the Aleutian Islanders perhaps “included input from a population related to Australo-Melanesians through an East Asian continental route [i.e., from Siberia across the Bering land bridge], and this genomic signal might have been subsequently transferred to parts of the Americas, including South America, through past gene flow events.”16 [part0050.html#note363]The problem I have with all this is that these hypothetical “past gene flowevents” somehow left a strong DNA signal in the Amazon, one of the remotest andmost inaccessible parts of South America, while leaving next to no signal at allin North America, which—whether the genes were carried by people who traveled onfoot or by people who island-hopped and coasted from the Aleutians in simplewatercraft—would surely have involved interactions with North Americanpopulations before any interactions with South American populations tookplace—and therefore presumably should have left a DNA signal in North America atleast as strong as the signal found in the Amazon.Seeking clarification, I contacted Professor Willerslev directly at theUniversity of Copenhagen on March 2, 2018, and asked what in his data had ledhim and his coauthors to conclude that the gene flow bringing the Australasiansignal to the Amazon had occurred after the initial peopling of the Americas. Ialso asked why they favored Aleutian islanders as the likely vector and whetherit was not counterintuitive to propose such an extreme northern source for thisgene flow. If a northern source had indeed been involved, I argued, then:wouldn’t we expect to see a cline in the signal from strongest in the north,nearest the putative source, to weakest in the faraway south and particularly inremote South American regions like the Amazon? But my understanding of the datais that if there is a cline at all it is in the opposite direction—i.e., fromstrongest in the south to weakest in the north. Am I understanding correctly andif so how do you explain this counterintuitive cline? Are we to imagineAleutians or Athabascans island-hopping and coasting down the entire Pacificcoast of North America, absolutely not intermingling with anyone else or leavingany DNA traces along the way, until they arrive (presumably) at some point onthe Pacific coast of South America whence they strike inland for the Amazon?17[part0050.html#note364]Professor Willerslev replied:When you talk about a cline in contemporary data you assume peoples have stayedin the same place since the Pleistocene. We do not know that. Therefore I don’tthink it’s a particularly good argument. A lot of stuff can happen over tens ofthousands of years in regard to distribution of peoples. In principle thesignature in the north could have been lost by replacement. We simply don’tknow.18 [part0050.html#note365]“Dear Eske,” I responded (happily we had agreed to switch to first-name terms):I take your point, absolutely, on all of this. And I certainly don’t imaginethat peoples have stayed in the same places since the Ice Age. It’s part of theessence of being human, I think, to move around, migrate, and explore. Still,will I be misrepresenting the facts if I were to state in my book, withreference specifically to present-day populations, that a cline of theAustralasian signal is evident with a stronger signal in South America,particularly the Amazon, than anywhere in North America? And further, again withreference specifically to present-day populations, would I be misrepresentingthe facts to say that the Australasian signal is stronger amongst the Surui thanit is amongst the Aleutians and Athabascans and that the Surui’s affinity toEast Asians, Oceanians, and Denisovans is stronger than that of the Inuit?19[part0050.html#note366]“No!” Eske replied, “I would not call it a cline.20 [part0050.html#note367]…It’s strongest in the Surui but stronger in Aleutians than in Athabascans … butthese groups also contain more East Asian so it may simply reflect just that.The Denisovan signal is not stronger in the Surui than in the others (to myknowledge).”21 [part0050.html#note368]In summary, therefore, taking into account all of the above, the situation seemsto be that the Denisovan signal remains at a constant and fairly low levelthroughout present-day indigenous populations so far sequenced in both North andSouth America.22 [part0050.html#note369] The Australasian signal, by contrast,is definitely and notably much stronger among populations in the Amazon, such asthe Surui, and much weaker among other Native Americans such as the Arhuaco (ofnon-Amazonian northern Colombia), the Wayuu (of non-Amazonian northernVenezuela), the Purepecha (of Mexico), and the Ojibwa, Cree, and Algonquin ofnorth and northeast North America. While never reaching the high levels foundamong Amazonian populations, the signal among Aleutian Islanders and Athabascansis relatively stronger than in other Native North American groups and relativelystronger in Aleutian Islanders than it is in Athabascans—though Raghavan andWillerslev warn in their Science paper that the Aleutian Islander data must beinterpreted with some caution since it “is heavily masked owing to recentadmixture with Europeans.”23 [part0050.html#note370]“THE MOST PARSIMONIOUS SOLUTION …”I NEXT REMINDED ESKE OF Skoglund and Reich’s papers. In these, as the readerwill recall, the authors contemplate the “formal possibility”24[part0050.html#note371] that the Australasian signal might reflect directsettlement in the Amazon by an Australasian-related population “that would thushave penetrated deep inside the Americas without mixing with the main ancestrallineage of present-day Native Americans.”25 [part0050.html#note372] My questionto Professor Willerslev, therefore, was whether there was anything in thegenetic data that he was aware of that would effectively refute the notion ofdirect settlement.His reply got straight to the point:Currently no one has a good explanation of the Australo-Melanesian signal. Allthat is put forward as possible explanations are purely speculative. So whetherit’s an old or a later event is unknown. What we do know is that it’s present insome Native American groups particularly from Brazil. We also know it has to bepre-Columbian. We also know that it’s not present in any of the ancientskeletons genome sequenced so far. Possible explanations can be: 1) It comes inafter the initial peopling of the Americas e.g. by costal migrations that do notleave much trace behind in contemporary populations (e.g. they move quickly), orthat we just haven’t sequenced the populations in North America that hold thesignal; 2) it’s an old migration through Beringia before Native Americans butthen it’s strange they leave no signals in the ancient skeletons sequenced sofar; 3) it’s a structured initial Native American population moving south intothe Americas of which some carry the signal but again then it’s strange thatthere is no evidence of admixture between the two groups; 4) someone holdingthis signal comes into the Americas not through Beringia but crossing into SouthAmerica across the Ocean. Based purely on the genetic data this is the mostparsimonious explanation but it does not make practical sense; 5) Finally it’s apossibility that the signal is a methodical artefact. That the methods are notbehaving as we think they should do.26 [part0050.html#note373]Apart from point 5, which is above my pay grade to assess, it was refreshing toencounter such a straightforward admission that no good explanation has yet beenoffered for the Australo-Melanesian signal, and such willingness to consider awide range of possibilities. Since I was already leaning toward the view thatthe signal is mysterious and might bear witness to a crossing of the PacificOcean followed by the settlement in the Amazon of a relatively small group, myeyes were naturally drawn to Eske’s point 4. “Based purely on the genetic data,”and invoking the parsimony principle (whereby the simplest scientificexplanation that fits the evidence is preferred), it looked very much as if thisleading figure in the study of ancient genetics agreed with me! Where he and Iparted company, however, was over the possibility that anybody could have madean oceanic crossing of thousands of kilometers during the Stone Age. For Eskesuch a proposition simply didn’t make practical sense.I sent him a follow-up mail to ask if he based this conclusion “on thearchaeological consensus that our Upper Palaeolithic and early Holoceneancestors were incapable of undertaking long trans-oceanic voyages?”27[part0050.html#note374]He replied, “In regard to crossing the Pacific. I’m not saying it did not happenbut there is no evidence suggesting that humans were capable of such a journeyuntil quite late in history (Polynesian expansion). It’s a possibility and I’mopen to the idea but there’s not much evidence supporting it except going forthe most parsimonious solution of the genetic data.”28 [part0050.html#note375]So here again is a refreshing openness of mind so rarely seen amongarchaeologists. The best fit for the genetic data does indeed appear to be atranspacific voyage (or voyages) to South America by a group (or groups) ofsettlers carrying Australo-Melanesian genes. However, on the matter of thepracticality of anyone undertaking transpacific voyages in the Stone Age, whichhas to do primarily with the level of technology attributed to our ancestors atthat time, Professor Willerslev accepts, and builds into his own reasoning, themainstream archaeological consensus that “there is no evidence suggesting thathumans were capable of such a journey until quite late in history.”He is not to be blamed for doing so, since it is normal in the sciences for anexpert in one field to trust and rely upon the conclusions of experts in otherfields. Quite possibly Professor Willerslev is not aware—why should he be?—ofhow little like a science archaeology really is and how often the mainstreamarchaeological consensus has proved, after suppressing dissenting opinions fordecades, to have been fundamentally wrong all along. Recent examples include thehasty and forced addition of more than 5,000 years to the previously acceptedchronology for the earliest megalithic sites after the discovery of11,600-year-old Gobekli Tepe in Turkey,29 [part0050.html#note376] the collapseof “Clovis First,” and the comprehensive debunking of the long-held belief thatthe Neanderthals were incapable of art.30 [part0050.html#note377] Clearly, themainstream archaeological consensus is not always right in what it agrees uponand it may well turn out that it is not right on the matter of grand oceanicvoyages during the Ice Age. Indeed, rather than being ruled out on the basis ofa priori assumptions, perhaps that strange Australo-Melanesian genetic signal inthe Amazon is part of the proof that such voyages must indeed have occurred.Then there’s the matter of the role of the Denisovans in all this. We know fromthe evidence of Denisova Cave itself that their technology—while undoubtedly“Stone Age”—was far ahead of its time and in some ways much more akin to theNeolithic than to the Upper Paleolithic. We know that they could make seacrossings and that they ranged over a vast area, at least from the AltaiMountains in the west to Australo-Melanesia in the east. Last but not least, weknow that their DNA survives most strongly today in people ofAustralo-Melanesian descent, and there’s informed speculation thatAustralo-Melanesia may have been their original homeland.It’s strange, and evocative, that the mystery of the Denisovans and the mysteryof the Australo-Melanesian genetic signal in the Amazon should collide in thisway, and all the more so because, as Eske Willerslev makes clear, there’s noespecially strong Denisovan element in the signal. Perhaps further research willprovide us with a higher-resolution picture, but from the data presently in handit looks like the gene flow to the Amazon involved a population ofAustralo-Melanesians who had undergone little or no mixing with Denisovans. Forsuch a people to have existed in the very area where the genetic evidencesuggests the Denisovans were most strongly congregated is itself somewhatmysterious and suggests some kind of selective process at work.In previous books, in particular Fingerprints of the Gods and Underworld, I havegiven extensive consideration to the intriguing phenomenon of ancient maps thatshow the world as it looked during the last Ice Age and do so, moreover, withstunning longitudinal and latitudinal accuracy and with the use of complexspherical trigonometry. Though it would be superfluous to reproduce hereevidence that I have already presented in such detail elsewhere, I include anappendix—appendix 2—that gives some indication of the richness and thesignificance of this overlooked material.However many times by however many hands they have been copied and recopied downthe ages, it is my contention that these anomalous maps can be traced back tolost source documents that could only have originated with a civilization atleast advanced enough to have explored the world, and to have mapped andmeasured it, when it was still in the grip of the Ice Age. A civilizationcapable of such feats must, at the very least, have had its own adepts in thetechniques of boat-building, sailing, navigating, cartography, and geometry—noneof these being among the skills that archaeologists are normally willing toattribute to Ice Age hunter-gatherers.It is not inconceivable, however, if such a hypothetical civilization hadexisted, that it might have sponsored “outreach programs” to thehunter-gatherers who also lived in the world at that time, just as our owntwenty-first-century technological civilization has “outreach programs” tohunter-gatherer tribes in the Amazon rainforest, the jungles of New Guinea, andthe Namibian desert today—anthropologists, aid workers, resettlement experts,and so on and so forth. It’s even conceivable that a hypothetical lostcivilization of the Ice Age could have had “resettlement experts” of its own whowere interested in the outcomes that might follow from physically removingpeople from one area—such as Melanesia, for example—and resettling them infar-off places like South America. If a global cataclysm were to loom,threatening the annihilation of the civilization, such “outreach” initiativesmight even have been accelerated to prepare hunter-gatherer populations to serveas refuges for the survivors.This is all pure speculation, of course, but at least it’s in good company. AsEske concedes, all of the explanations—including his own—that have so far beenoffered to account for the presence of Australasian DNA in the Amazon are“purely speculative.”And the mystery continues to deepen. In November 2018, two major new studieswere published, one in the journal Cell, coauthored by Cosimo Posth, DavidReich, and others, and the second in Science, coauthored by Eske Willerslev, J.Victor Moreno-Mayar, David Meltzer, and others.31 [part0050.html#note378] Thesenew studies found Australasian DNA already present in skeletal remains fromLagoa Santa, Brazil, dated to 10,400 years ago, and confirmed the suspicion ofthe researchers that the anomalous genetic signal must have reached SouthAmerica in the “Late Pleistocene”32 [part0050.html#note379]—that is, near theend of the last Ice Age.“How did it get there?” wonders geneticist J. Victor Moreno-Mayar, immediatelyanswering his own question as follows: “We have no idea.” Similarly, David J.Meltzer expressed amazement at the most peculiar character of the signal, soclearly present in South America yet “somehow leaping over all North America ina single bound.”33 [part0050.html#note380]For the purposes of my own quest, however, that anomalous, unexplained signalhad the effect of opening up a new and fruitful avenue of inquiry. With thearchetypally North American Clovis culture now known to have South Americangenetic roots, it was becoming increasingly obvious that to explore themysteries of one half of the megacontinent I could not be oblivious to what hadhappened in the other half.My focus would remain on North America, to which we’ll return in part 5, but Ihad a strong intuition that I might miss an important piece of the puzzle if Ifailed to investigate the Amazon first.I resented the intuition, which felt like a diversion, but it was so insistentthat ultimately I could not ignore it."},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00043.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00044.jpeg]GHOST CITIES OF THE AMAZONIN MY QUEST FOR THE traces of a lost civilization of prehistoric antiquity, theAmazon rainforest at first seemed to have little to offer. Without that teasing,tantalizing Australasian DNA signal I probably wouldn’t have given it a secondthought. But the signal was there, it was real, it was hugely anomalous, and itcried out for a deeper inquiry.Along with much of the rest of the Americas, the Amazon entered Europeanconsciousness in the sixteenth century—the century of conquest. It was not aprimary target. Mexico and Peru were hit first, their armies conquered, theirwealth pillaged. Then rumors began to circulate of exotic civilizations rich ingold hidden in the jungles beyond the Andes Mountains. The greed of theSpaniards was aroused and in February 1541 Francisco de Orellana and GonzaloPizarro (the latter the brother of Francisco Pizarro, the conqueror of Peru)struck east from the city of Quito in Ecuador on a journey into the unknown.Their mission was nothing less than to find the fabled El Dorado in the remoteinterior of South America and to loot the vast wealth they expected to findpiled up there. In this they failed but in the grander scheme of things theysucceeded mightily, for their expedition left us with the earliest survivingeyewitness account of the Amazon—unfortunately not of the pre-Columbian Amazon,which would have been ideal, but of the Amazon so soon after contact that itremained, effectively, in its pre-Columbian state. As such, it has much to tellus about the lost prehistory of the Americas.At the head of a force of more than 200 Spanish soldiers, Orellana and Pizarrodescended from the Andes. Hacking their way through increasingly dense anddifficult jungle and fighting multiple engagements with hostile tribes, theyeventually reached the banks of the Coca River, a tributary of the Napo Riverthat is, in turn, an important tributary of the great and majestic Amazonitself. The terrain made further overland travel almost impossible and, far fromfinding and reveling in the supposedly limitless riches of El Dorado, theconquistadors were by now depleted by illness and weak with hunger. Theirsolution was to build a fair-sized boat, which they named the San Pedro. In it,on Pizarro’s orders, Orellana then embarked with a force of 50 men to seek outand raid local villages for food.The agreement was that Orellana would return within 12 days with whateversupplies he could gather. Unfortunately, however, the Amazon River system hadn’tbeen consulted when the plan was made, and the San Pedro was swept downstream atsuch a rate that very soon it was hundreds of miles away and the prospect of areturn against the powerful currents was most uninviting. Besides, even ifOrellana’s force had been able to row the rough-and-ready craft upstream againthere was no guarantee that they would ever find their way back to Pizarrothrough the maze of braided river channels in which one opening looked very muchlike the next.They decided, therefore, to press on and, in the process, became the firstEuropeans ever to navigate the entire length of the Amazon River and to crossthe full width of South America from west to east. This was barely 20 yearsafter the Spanish brought smallpox to the “New World”—another first!—and thegreat pandemics that were to depopulate the Americas had not yet penetrateddeeply (if at all) into the remote fastness of the Amazon jungle. The pale horseof death would very soon follow, but Orellana’s adventure took place at justabout the last time that the cultures and civilizations that had thrived andprospered in the rainforest for thousands of years could ever be seen insomething approaching their original form and context.For that reason we are fortunate that Orellana and his murderous gang ofmercenaries—often starving, often having to fight for their lives—wereaccompanied on this desperate voyage by Brother Gaspar de Carvajal, a literateand sensitive Dominican friar who kept a journal throughout. In it he describeshimself as “a man to whom God chose to give a part in such a strange andhitherto never experienced voyage of discovery, such as this one which I shallrelate from here on.”1 [part0050.html#note381]The expeditionaries frequently faced extreme privations. On one occasion, forexample, Carvajal reports that after many days without food,we were eating nothing but leather, belts and soles of shoes, cooked withcertain herbs, with the result that so great was our weakness that we could notremain standing, for some on all fours and others with staffs went into thewoods to search for a few roots to eat and some there were who ate certain herbswith which they were not familiar, and they were at the point of death, becausethey were like mad men and did not possess sense; but as Our Lord was pleasedthat we should continue our journey, no-one died.2 [part0050.html#note382]Whether by divine intervention or by good luck, or because of Orellana’seffective leadership, none of his tough and resourceful men died of starvationon the voyage, and only a handful lost their lives due to infections, disease,and battle wounds. It was, all in all, a 7,000-kilometer journey, the whole ofwhich, from departure from Quito in February 1541 to arrival at Marajo Island inthe Amazon estuary on the Atlantic coast of Brazil in August 1542, took 18months.More important by far than his descriptions of the risks and dangers of theadventure, the great historical significance of Carvajal’s journal is theshockingly counterintuitive picture it paints of a vast and complex Amazon.Certainly there were regions of complete wilderness where the expeditionariessuffered badly—hundreds of kilometers of deserted riverbanks with no people, nocrops, and apparently no wildlife. But we discover as we read on that theseempty quarters were interspersed with regions of astonishing, heavily populatedabundance, where “great cities” more than 20 kilometers from end-to-end, roughlythe length of Manhattan, lined the riverbanks.3 [part0050.html#note383] HereCarvajal reports that enormous expanses were given over to productiveagriculture4 [part0050.html#note384] and there were signs everywhere of largeand well-organized political and economic systems linked to centralized statesthat were capable of fielding disciplined armies thousands strong.5[part0050.html#note385]These last glimpses of the Amazon before the ruination of European contact hintat a glorious, sophisticated, and technologically advanced indigenousprehistory. Carvajal tells of one stretch of the mighty river, 80leagues—possibly more than 500 kilometers6 [part0050.html#note386]—in length,ruled by a “great overlord named Machiparo.” Throughout his territories a singlelanguage was spoken and the towns and villages stood so close together thatthere was usually not more than “a crossbow shot” between them.7[part0050.html#note387]A week later the Spaniards came to a “fortified village” and, finding themselvesshort of food they took it by storm, killing some of the inhabitants and forcingthe remainder to flee into the jungle. They then “remained resting, regalingourselves with good lodgings, eating all we wanted, for three days in thisvillage. There were many roads here that entered into the interior of the land,very fine highways.”8 [part0050.html#note388]Orellana took these latter as an ominous sign—the locals they had driven out oftheir homes might easily return with reinforcements—and the expedition sailedon, enjoying the abundant and varied foods that they now found everywhere ontheir route downriver.9 [part0050.html#note389]The next major halt was at “a village that was on a high bank, and as itappeared small to us the Captain ordered us to capture it, and also because itlooked so nice that it seemed as if it might be the recreation spot of someoverlord of the inland.”10 [part0050.html#note390]The residents put up a tough fight but were eventually expelled:And we were masters of the village, where we found very great quantities of foodof which we laid in a supply. In this village there was a villa in which therewas a great deal of porcelain-ware of various makes, both jars and pitchers,very large, with a capacity of more than twenty-five arrobas [one hundredgallons], and other small pieces such as plates and bowls and candelabra of thisporcelain of the best that has ever been seen in the world, for that of Malagais not its equal, because this porcelain which we found, is all glazed andembellished with all colors, and so bright are these colors that they astonish,and, more than this, the drawings and paintings which they make on them are soaccurately worked out that one wonders how with only natural skill theymanufacture and decorate all these things making them look just like Romanarticles; and here the Indians told us that as much as there was made out ofclay in this house, so much there was back in the country in gold and silver.11[part0050.html#note391]From this village, as from others through which they had passed, “there went outmany roads and fine highways to the inland country.”12 [part0050.html#note392]Orellena had previously resisted the impulse to explore these enticing junglethoroughfares but now, wishing to find out where they led to—perhaps even to ElDorado itself!—he took several companions with him and set out. Once again,however, discretion got the better of valor:He had not gone half a league when the roads became more like royal highways andwider and when the Captain had perceived this, he decided to turn back, becausehe saw that it was not prudent to go on any further.13 [part0050.html#note393]No doubt Orellana’s prudence was among the reasons that so many of his mensurvived the perilous 7,000-kilometer voyage from the Andes to the Atlantic, butit is a matter of profound regret that he did not explore those “royal highways”through the jungle. In consequence, today we may only imagine where—andwhat—they led to.UNPALATABLE TRUTHSALTHOUGH WIDELY DISCUSSED AT THE time, Carvajal’s journal, the first eyewitnessaccount of the full length of the Amazon in a near-pristine state, subsequentlydisappeared from public view for more than 300 years.14 [part0050.html#note394]It only resurfaced in the nineteenth century following an exhaustive archivalsearch by the Chilean scholar José Toribio Medina, who published it in 1895.15[part0050.html#note395]Still it seemed that forces were at work to sideline Carvajal’s uniquelyimportant contribution to our understanding of the ancient Amazon. No sooner wasthe journal in print, at any rate, than it began to be “debunked” by scholars.16[part0050.html#note396]For example, there were strident objections to a claim made at one point inCarvajal’s account that statuesque female archers, whom the friar unhesitatinglycalls “Amazons” after the warrior women of classical Greek myth,17[part0050.html#note397] had participated in an attack on Orellana’sexpeditionaries.18 [part0050.html#note398] Carvajal also states that many of theother peoples they met on the journey were “subjects of the Amazons” whosedominions were extensive and whose sumptuous capital city had five enormoustemples at its heart:19 [part0050.html#note399]In these buildings they had many gold and silver idols in the form of women, andmany vessels of gold and silver for the service of the Sun.20[part0050.html#note400]Such descriptions enjoyed wide currency and inflamed the public imagination inthe years following the voyage.21 [part0050.html#note401] As a result, the greatriver system Orellana explored is not today named after him, or some otherSpanish adventurer, but called the “Amazon” instead.22 [part0050.html#note402]To the skeptics of a later age, however, the link to the classical world thatCarvajal suggested, and the notion of a lavish city in the depths of the jungle,seemed ridiculous.Nor was this all.What really stuck in the skeptical craw were the accounts Carvajal gave of theinhabitants of the rainforest, of the general level of their civilization, ofthe refinement of their arts and crafts, and particularly of the extent of theirsettlements—not only the fabulous capital of the Amazons but also other “verylarge cities,” including some that “glistened in white.”23[part0050.html#note403] By the 1890s the view had already set in amonganthropologists and archaeologists that the Americas as a whole had only beenpeopled relatively recently—and it was strongly believed that one of the verylast places to be settled, in this generally very late migration scenario, wouldhave been the Amazon. As this view tightened its grip in subsequent decades, itbegan to seem obvious to all serious-minded researchers—so obvious as to bebeyond question—that the Amazon could only been have been inhabited for about1,000 years, and then only by very small groups of hunter-gatherers since thejungle was “resource-poor.”24 [part0050.html#note404] Indeed in this same vein,even as late as the 1990s, the rainforest was still being depicted byenvironmentalists as “a counterfeit paradise whose lush vegetation hidnutrient-poor soils incapable of supporting large populations and complexsocieties.”25 [part0050.html#note405]The reason Carvajal’s account was disbelieved for most of the twentieth centuryby almost everyone who reviewed it is therefore plain to see. The picture hepainted of the pre-contact state of the peoples and cultures of the Amazon flewin the face of a dominant (and domineering) scholarly theory. Predictably,therefore, the first reaction of most archaeologists was not to question thetheory in the light of the rediscovery, after long neglect, of an on-the-spot,eyewitness account. Instead they chose to defend the theory and undermineCarvajal by accusing him of lying in order to glorify the achievements of theexpedition.The friar gives us his word—no small matter for such a man—that he wrote only“the truth throughout.”26 [part0050.html#note406] But his accounts of cities,huge populations, advanced ceramics (“surpassing those of Malaga”), andenormous, fertile agricultural lands along the course of the Amazon were toosubversive to be accepted. Quite simply, if he was right about all this, thenthe modern “experts” were wrong—and that could not be tolerated.Indeed the judgment that Carvajal was a fantasist and a liar, and that nothinghe had said about the Amazon could be taken seriously, seemed about to be set instone when the first shreds of the evidence that would ultimately exonerate him,proving that he had indeed told the truth throughout, began to emerge.DID AMAZONIAN CITIES EXIST?PROFESSOR DAVID WILKINSON OF UCLA, an authority on long-term and large-scalephenomena in world politics, including empires and systems of independentstates, has made a special study of the level of civilization in the Amazonprior to European contact.The key question for civilizationists is: were there Amazonian cities beforeEuropean contact? “Civilizations” require “cities,” and “cities” are thedefining feature of “civilizations.” And by “cities,” we mean 4th magnitudesettlements, i.e. settlements with a population of not less than the order of10^4 (~10,000) … Did Amazonian cities exist?27 [part0050.html#note407]Judging from the earliest reports of Spanish and Portuguese expeditions, saysWilkinson, “the answer would certainly have to be in the affirmative.”28[part0050.html#note408] He draws particular attention to one of the cities,mentioned earlier, that extended for more than 20 kilometers from end to end,29[part0050.html#note409] and to another settlement that Carvajal describes as“more than two leagues long.”30 [part0050.html#note410] The exact length of aleague, Wilkinson notes, was “not a fully agreed-upon or stabilized physicaldistance, but was probably not less than 2.5 English statute miles nor more than4.”31 [part0050.html#note411] A settlement of close-packed housing covering 2leagues would therefore have been between 5 miles (8 kilometers) and 8 miles (13kilometers) in extent. Here Wilkinson refers us to a study by an internationalteam of anthropologists and geologists who focused on what is known about thissettlement and calculated that it would have housed “perhaps 10,000inhabitants.”32 [part0050.html#note412] As Wilkinson notes, this therefore makesit, by definition, a fourth-magnitude settlement—that is, a city, and “hencepart of a civilization.”33 [part0050.html#note413] It follows that the largersettlement, with an extent of more than 20 kilometers, would likely have had atleast twice as many inhabitants, that is, 20,000 or more.It is instructive to compare these figures with those of “civilized” Europe in asimilar time frame.34 [part0050.html#note414] Certainly London, with apopulation estimated at 60,000 in the sixteenth century,35[part0050.html#note415] was larger than either of the two Amazonian cities weare considering here, but the difference was one of degree, not of kind. TheBritish city of York, an established urban center since Roman times, had apopulation estimated at between 10,000 to 12,000 in the sixteenth century36[part0050.html#note416]—very much on the same scale as the Amazoniancities—while in Spain, Toledo did not achieve a population of 13,000 until themid-nineteenth century.37 [part0050.html#note417]On Carvajal’s account, therefore, not only did the Amazon have cities but itscities were comparable in size to those of Europe at the same time. He alsoreports that the chieftain Machiparo ruled over “many settlements and very largeones which together contribute for fighting purposes fifty thousand men of theage of from thirty years up to seventy, because the young men do not go to war.”Aside from the interesting anthropological observation about the age at whichmen in sixteenth-century Amazonian society went to war, this statement hasimportant implications for our understanding of the population of the region.Machiparo’s domain was just one among many through which the Orellana expeditionpassed, yet if Carvajal reported correctly it could muster an army 50,000strong. This is a greater number than Denmark and Norway combined, or Sweden andFinland combined, or Brandenburg-Prussia, or even the Tsardom of Russia, couldfield in the same period.38 [part0050.html#note418]A view of the Amazon as an “uncivilized” and “savage” place—indeed as the veryepitome of savagery—has been deeply ingrained in the European psyche forcenturies. It is therefore not surprising the Carvajal was disbelieved when hisjournal finally surfaced in 1895. Also disbelieved were the reports of the twosimilar adventures that followed—the Ursua expedition, which took place 20 yearsafter Orellana’s voyage, and the Teixeira expedition of 1637–38.There was no official recorder for the Ursua expedition, but one of itsofficers, a certain Captain Altamirano, provides independent confirmation ofCarvajal’s observations when he speaks of settlements with populations of around10,000 in the heart of the Amazon jungle—at the lower end of the urban scale,but again, as Professor David Wilkinson notes, “city-sized.”39[part0050.html#note419]By the time of the Teixeira expedition the region had been riven by smallpoxepidemics that caused depopulation across wide areas, and had also begun tosuffer other negative effects of European penetration and exploitation.Nonetheless the expedition’s Jesuit priest, Father Cristóbal de Acuña, who, likeCarvajal, kept a journal, could report that “the river of Amazons waters moreextensive regions, fertilizes more plains, supports more people, and augments byits floods a mightier ocean” than the Ganges, Euphrates, or Nile. Like Carvajaland Altamirano before him, Acuña, too, was still able to speak of an “infinityof Indians” and of inhabited areas hundreds of kilometers in extent where thesettlements were packed “so close together, that one is scarcely lost sight ofwhen another comes in view.”40 [part0050.html#note420]“These testimonials,” Wilkinson writes, “would seem sufficient. Witheyewitnesses reporting the size of settlements and the wealth of surplus foodavailable to support dense populations (and social complexity), there could be,and apparently there was indeed, pre-Columbian civilization in the Amazonbasin.”41 [part0050.html#note421]The problem, however, as Wilkinson immediately concedes, is that “serious doubtslater arose.”42 [part0050.html#note422]The first element of doubt had to do with the accounts of subsequentpenetrations of Amazonia—after the Orellana, Ursua, and Teixeira expeditions. Inthis regard the observations of Padre Samuel Fritz, a Jesuit preacher, are ofparticular significance.43 [part0050.html#note423] He lived among the Omaguas,through whose domains along the banks of the Rio Napo, between the Coca andAguarico, the Orellana expedition passed and which Carvajal (although he doesnot refer to the Omagua by name) describes as densely populated.44[part0050.html#note424]Not so according to Padre Fritz! Between 1686 and 1715 he establishedthirty-eight Jesuit missions among the Omagua and noted on a map that theimportant settlements among which he had planted these missions had a combinedtotal population of just 26,000 people45 [part0050.html#note425]—quite adifferent matter from the hundreds of thousands reported by Carvajal. Let usnote in passing—for there is a hint here of what was really going on—thatFritz’s main preoccupation, other than preaching, was to advise “these smallweak village communities on how to retreat and regroup upriver to evadecontinual Portuguese slave-raiding.”46 [part0050.html#note426]Likewise, a little later—between 1743 and 1744—the French geographerCharles-Marie de la Condamine traveled through the region and reported no citiesor armies in Amazonia, again in stark contrast to Orellana. For Condamine, theOmaguas were “a people formerly powerful” while along the entire river system hefound “no warlike tribes inimical to Europeans, all such having either submittedor withdrawn themselves to the interior.”47 [part0050.html#note427]These reports, and many others like them as the eighteenth century merged intothe nineteenth and the nineteenth into the twentieth, did serious damage to thecredibility of the earlier explorers—to such an extent that SmithsonianInstitution archaeologist Betty Meggers was still insisting, before she passedaway in 2012, that Carvajal had either misunderstood everything he saw or, morelikely, that his entire account was riddled with fantasy and invention.48[part0050.html#note428]THE LONG SHADOW OF BETTY MEGGERSTHROUGHOUT HER WORKING LIFE MEGGERS was a passionate advocate of the view thatno pre-Columbian Amazonian settlement could ever have supported even 1,000people, let alone several thousands or even tens of thousands as Carvajal hadreported. It was likewise her opinion that the level of sophistication Carvajalhad described—the armies, the food storage, the porcelain specialists, and soon—was in fact completely impossible given the limitations of the Amazonianenvironment.49 [part0050.html#note429]Meggers’s Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise, published in 1971(but expanding on work she had done and conclusions she had reached in the1950s), has been described as possibly “the most influential book ever writtenabout the Amazon.”50 [part0050.html#note430] And indeed, it was this book, andthe “environmental limitation” movement that it spawned—because many otherarchaeologists, anthropologists, and ecologists simply followed Meggers withoutquestion—that for a long while served as the sole acceptable reference framethrough which the prehistory of the Amazon would be understood. As ProfessorWilkinson puts it, “the meticulously careful and systematic researches of 20thcentury cultural-ecologist archaeologists” like Meggers created a consensus that“large-scale settlements and societies” could never have existed in what theenvironmental limitationists saw as the “wet-desert” of Amazonia.51[part0050.html#note431]But as was the case with Vance Haynes and the mistaken Clovis First doctrinethat kept so many locked in illusion for so long, so it was with the ideas ofMeggers and her followers. A dominant individual, with a prestigious position,can delay the progress of knowledge for decades but ultimately cannot stop thebuildup of contrary evidence and opinions that will lead to a new paradigm.Predictably, therefore, as Wilkinson goes on to note in his study of Amazoniancivilization:Towards the end of the 20th century, the archaeological pendulum began to swingback toward crediting the early explorers’ accounts. Even Meggers [in Amazonia:Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise] had passed on without comment areport [dated approximately 1662] by Mauricio de Heriarte that the capital ofthe Tapajós (at today’s Santarem) could field 60,000 warriors. Any such numberof militia would by … comparative-civilizational standards have implied an urbanpopulation of 300,000 to 360,000!52 [part0050.html#note432]It is troubling, in retrospect, that Meggers knew of, yet did not consider, theimplications of Heriarte’s report—but, of course, had she done so, she wouldhave been obliged to rethink her whole thesis. Within twenty years after thepublication of Counterfeit Paradise, however, other scholars were actively doingthe rethinking for her. Notable among them was Anna Curtenius Roosevelt, nowprofessor of anthropology at the University of Illinois at Chicago. In 1993 shepresented evidence that some pre-Columbian Amazonian settlements “held manythousands of people … from several thousands, to tens of thousands ofindividuals or more.” And in 1999 she wrote, “In Amazonia, non-state societiesappear to have organized large, dense populations, intensive subsistenceadaptations, large systems of earthworks, production of elaborate artworks andarchitecture for considerable periods of time.”53 [part0050.html#note433]Likewise, in 1994, anthropologist Neil Whitehead concluded of the prehistoricAmazon, “We are dealing with civilizations of considerable complexity, perhapseven protostates.”54 [part0050.html#note434] And in 2001, Michael Heckenberger,James Petersen, and Eduardo Neves, facing criticism from Meggers, stronglydefended their own by then well-established position that “there were pastAmazonian societies significantly larger than anything reported in the past100–200 years,”55 [part0050.html#note435] that these societies included“chiefdoms” or “kingdoms,”56 [part0050.html#note436] and that “lostcivilizations” were indeed present in some parts of the Amazon before Europeancontact.57 [part0050.html#note437]What are we to make of all this to-ing and fro-ing?In summary, “to address the contradictions in the sources and among theauthorities,” Wilkinson asks, “If there were Amazonian cities, where did theygo? And, if there were Amazonian cities, how could they have subsisted?”58[part0050.html#note438]He gives two two-word answers to these questions—“recurrent catastrophes” to thefirst and “exemplary agronomy” to the second.EXTINCTION AND AMNESIAWE’LL COME TO THE EXEMPLARY agronomy in a later chapter, but let’s deal with therecurrent catastrophes now.Prior to the Orellana expedition, smallpox may already have found its way to theAmazon overland from Mexico where it had been introduced during the Spanishconquest a few decades earlier.59 [part0050.html#note439] If not, then thedirect transmission of the disease to Peru in 1532–33 by Pizarro’s conquistadorscertainly brought it into the Andes Mountains in force, making it only a matterof time before it descended to the east side of the range and thoroughlyinfiltrated the rainforest.60 [part0050.html#note440] Quite possibly, althoughthere is no proof, the Orellana expedition may itself have been the firstprincipal vector that carried the scourge into the heart of the Amazon but if soit was certainly not the last—nor was smallpox the only Old World disease towhich Europeans possessed significant immunity while Native Americans did not.Measles, influenza, and other viruses also took a ghastly toll.Wilkinson cites an important study by anthropologist Thomas P. Myers thatdocuments “more than 30 epidemics—smallpox, measles, and other outbreaks—some‘on a massive scale’—in 16th–18th century South America.”61[part0050.html#note441] Myers finds evidence of “very substantial depopulationbetween the Orellana and Teixeira expeditions” and estimates that in many areasit ran as high 99 percent.62 [part0050.html#note442] This, he further suggests,“may have been the reason why the missionaries later transmitted the idea of arelatively uninhabited Amazon region. The people they found were the survivorsof the diseases and epidemics.”63 [part0050.html#note443]The implications of the virtual extinction of the Amazon’s pre-Columbianpopulation are immense. If so many died, then we can be sure that much else diedwith them. As Wilkinson succinctly phrases it, “A small city of 10,000 thatloses 99% of its inhabitants becomes a village of 100, that can do far less.”64[part0050.html#note444]Likewise, by extension, we can imagine what would have happened if that citywere just a small part of a great and complex civilization of the Amazon and ifthat entire civilization were deprived of 99 percent of its warriors, 99 percentof its farmers, 99 percent of its hunters and gatherers, 99 percent of itsastronomers, 99 percent of its healers and shamans, 99 percent of itsarchitects, 99 percent of its boat builders, and 99 percent of its wisdomkeepers. Of course, across the scale of the whole Amazon basin, this would nothave happened overnight; likely it would have extended over a century or two—acreeping cataclysm rather than a single big hit. But the end result, whether itcame slow or fast, would have been the same. Once left deserted, the greatcities and monuments and other public works of any hypothetical Amazoniancivilization would quickly have been encroached upon and soon completely hiddenby the jungle while, at the same time, cultural memory banks would have beenwiped almost clean and vast resources of skills, knowledge, and potential wouldhave been lost forever.Little wonder, then, that to this day amnesia, confusion, contradictions, andmystery confound the search for the truth of the Amazon’s deep past."},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00045.jpeg]THE ANCIENTS BEHIND THE VEILTHE DNA EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN part 3 reveals an astonishing anomaly. At somepoint during the Ice Age, perhaps as early as 13,000 years ago, a group ofpeople carrying Australo-Melanesian genes settled in what is now the Amazonjungle.The Amazon basin today is a vast and diverse region encompassing almost 7million square kilometers, of which approximately 5.5 million square kilometersare still covered by rainforest.1 [part0050.html#note445] The figures onlybecome meaningful by comparison. The whole of India, with a total area of 3.29million square kilometers, is less than half the size of the Amazon basin,2[part0050.html#note446] but Australia, at 7.7 million square kilometers, isbigger,3 [part0050.html#note447] as are China (9.59 million square kilometers),4[part0050.html#note448] Canada (9.98 million square kilometers),5[part0050.html#note449] the United States (9.63 million square kilometers),6[part0050.html#note450] and Europe (10.18 million square kilometers).7[part0050.html#note451] All in all, then, it’s fair to say that what the Amazonconfronts us with is a truly gigantic landmass, on a similar scale to many ofthe world’s largest countries and regions, extending for thousands of kilometersfrom north to south and thousands of kilometers from east to west.There has been no lasting scholarly consensus on the climate, environment,vegetation, and tree cover of the Ice Age Amazon (see appendix 3[part0049.html#1ENBI0-6d489586c24d4bc6a7d8fba43c80bb24] for details) but thesituation is possibly even worse around the issue of the peopling of thisimmense region—and indeed around the entire vexed question of how and whenhumans began to settle in South America as a whole.The reader will recall from part 2 that it was Tom Dillehay, professor ofanthropology at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, who first put the cat amongthe Clovis pigeons with his excavations at Monte Verde in southern Chile. Theexcavations began in 1977 and continue to this day, with multiple reports andpapers published in scientific journals. The story is therefore a long one, butto make it short let’s just say that Dillehay’s extensive and meticulousexcavations initially revealed, in his own words:one valid human site (MV-II) dated ~14,500 cal BP. … Although bifacialprojectile points, flaked debitage, and grinding stones were recovered, mostlithic tools were edge-trimmed pebble flakes and sling and grooved bola stones.8[part0050.html#note452]Seen through the distorting lens of the “Clovis First” belief system, Dillehay’sdate looked very threatening—in part because the artifacts, tools, and pointsfound at Monte Verde had nothing to do with Clovis whatsoever but more sobecause to have reached the far south of South America by 14,500 years ago meantthat the ancestors of these settlers must have crossed the Bering land bridge(the full length of two continents away) long before that and therefore, bydefinition, that Clovis was very far indeed from being “first.”All Dillehay’s battles with Vance Haynes and his supporters were over thisrelatively conservative date of 14,500 years ago—and as we’ve seen, Monte Verdewas vindicated in that fight after a site visit in 1997 when the Clovis Firsters(begrudgingly) conceded defeat.But the story was far from over and as the excavations at Monte Verde continued,deeper and older occupation levels began to be exposed, yielding increasinglymore ancient dates. The results of these new studies were published by Dillehayin November 2015, confirming a revised age for Monte Verde of around 18,500years9 [part0050.html#note453] and revealing that the site had been reoccupiedseveral times thereafter over a period of more than 4,000 years.10[part0050.html#note454] Again in Dillehay’s own words:The new evidence is multiple, spatially discontinuous, low-density occurrencesof stratigraphic in situ stone artifacts, faunal remains, and burned areas thatsuggests discrete horizons of ephemeral human activity radiocarbon dated between~14,500 and possibly as early as 19,000 cal BP.11 [part0050.html#note455]Nor, it seems, is Monte Verde quite done with surprising us. Even as he wasreporting his first paradigm-busting date of 14,500 years ago for MV-II,Dillehay was already drawing attention, in a rather careful, noncommittal way,to the possibility that MV-I, another area of the site, might be older—and notjust 18,500 or 19,000 years old but perhaps significantly more than 30,000 yearsold:MV-I dated ~33,000 BP … initially defined by scattered occurrences of threeclay-lined, possible culturally produced burned areas and twenty-six stones, atleast six of which suggest modification by humans. This … evidence from MV-I wastoo meager and too laterally discontinuous to falsify or verify itsarchaeological validity.12 [part0050.html#note456]This whole issue, which even the most adamant Clovis Firsters on the 1997 sitevisit had admitted was “extremely intriguing,”13 [part0050.html#note457] wasreexamined by Dillehay and his team in the 2015 study, across several areas ofMonte Verde. Dates as tantalizingly ancient as 43,500 years ago were associatedwith the remains and artifacts unearthed, but Dillehay again carefully judgedthe finds to be “still too meagre and inconclusive to determine whether theyrepresent human activity or indeterminate natural features. At present thelatter case is perhaps more feasible given there is presently no convincingarchaeological or other data to substantiate a human presence in South Americaprior to 20,000 years ago.”14 [part0050.html#note458]ONE MORE LINE IN THE SAND CROSSEDDESPITE HAVING FOR SO LONG been a rebel on the subject of First Americans,despite having been vindicated in the end on his first date for Monte Verde,despite having then published new dates pushing the age of the site backfurther, and despite those “meagre” hints of even greater antiquity, it doessound very much as if Dillehay was imitating his former critics here. Just asthey used to argue that there was no convincing archaeological evidence tosubstantiate a human presence in South America 14,500 years ago, now he wassaying there was none prior to 20,000 years ago.When, I wonder, will archaeologists take to heart the old dictum that absence ofevidence is not the same thing as evidence of absence, and learn the lessonsthat their own profession has repeatedly taught—namely that the next turn of theexcavator’s spade can change everything? So little of the surface area of ourplanet has been subjected to any kind of archaeological investigation at allthat it would be more logical to regard every major conclusion reached by thisdiscipline as provisional—particularly so when we are dealing with a period asremote, as tumultuous, and as little understood as the Ice Age.I was therefore not at all surprised, after Dillehay had drawn his line in thesand at 20,000 years ago, that later research, published in August 2017,confirmed a human presence in South America even earlier in the Ice Age!This followed decades of study by a team under the leadership of Denis Vialou ofthe Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris at the Santa Elina rockshelter in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso.15 [part0050.html#note459] Locatedat the convergence of two major river basins, and roughly at the geographiccenter of South America as a whole, the shelter is known for its huge display ofaround 1,000 prehistoric paintings and drawings.16 [part0050.html#note460] Inthe long rectangular habitation area nearby, Vialou found and excavated a seriesof beautifully stratified deposits testifying to different periods of humanoccupation from 27,600 years ago down to 23,000 years ago.17[part0050.html#note461] Some very finely worked and drilled bone ornaments wereamong the objects discovered.18 [part0050.html#note462]Image Missing [../images/00046.jpeg]PEDRA FURADAMORE THAN 2,000 KILOMETERS NORTHEAST of Santa Elina, the eminent archaeologistNiède Guidon has spent 40 years excavating hundreds—literally hundreds!—ofrichly painted prehistoric rock shelters in Serra da Capivara National Park inthe Brazilian state of Piauí. While everyone else is playing catch-up, she haslong been confident that humans arrived in South America much earlier than20,000 years ago. In 1986–3 years before Dillehay first began to offer his owncautious dissent from the Clovis First paradigm—she published a paper in Natureboldly titled “Carbon-14 Dates Point to Man in the Americas 32,000 Years Ago.”19[part0050.html#note463] It was a report on her work at a particularly large andrichly decorated rock shelter called Pedra Furada where she had excavated “asequence containing abundant lithic industry and well-structured hearths at alllevels” documenting continuous human occupation over the entire period from6,160 years ago to 32,160 years ago.20 [part0050.html#note464] In addition, shefound conclusive evidence that at least one of the spectacular rock paintingswas 17,000 years old:This pictograph indicates the practice of rupestral art [i.e., rock art] at thattime and makes the site of Pedra Furada the most ancient rupestral art siteknown in America and one of the most ancient in the world.21[part0050.html#note465]But this was just the beginning, and in 2003 Guidon and other researcherscompleted a further study. The results pushed back the date of the humanpresence at Pedra Furada to 48,500 years ago,22 [part0050.html#note466] and ofthe paintings themselves, to at least 36,000 years ago.23[part0050.html#note467]Most archaeologists—particularly North American archaeologists still partiallyunder the spell of Clovis First—have not embraced Guidon’s interpretation of theevidence at Pedra Furada. This, however, does not mean that she is wrong, onlythat she is willing to think—and thoroughly investigate—outside the box. She isan acerbic critic of what she calls the “climate of scepticism attending olddates”24 [part0050.html#note468] that has haunted American archaeology for solong, and of the unquestioning acceptance of Beringia as “the only realisticroute for human entry to the New World.”25 [part0050.html#note469]Guidon does not see any reason why Beringia should have been the only route ofentry:Everybody is willing to give humans the abilities necessary for voyaging acrossto Australia about 60,000 years ago. Why then would it have been impossible forthem to pass from island to island along the Aleutians, just as one example? Wehave no justification for converting the humans who peopled the Americas to asingle state of being, where they could do nothing but follow herds by a landroute.26 [part0050.html#note470]In another paper anticipating the speculations of geneticists like Skoglund,Reich, and Willerslev by more than a decade, she goes even further, reminding usof the puzzling cranial morphology of certain ancient Brazilian skulls (reviewedin appendix 1) and concluding that, “although little probable”:the possibility of migration from Australia and surrounding islands across thePacific Ocean … more than 50 k years ago cannot be discarded.27[part0050.html#note471]HIDDEN REALMSIT IS IN THE AMAZON basin that the oddly misplaced Australasian genetic signalbeats out its enigmatic pulse. As well as being very far indeed from Australiaand Papua New Guinea, however, neither Monte Verde, nor Santa Elina nor PedraFurada are in the Amazon Basin—though the latter two are closer than the former,being respectively about 515 kilometers and 625 kilometers as the crow fliesfrom the Xingu River, a major southeastern tributary of the Amazon.28[part0050.html#note472]The long-standing but now thoroughly discredited archaeological model wherebythe Amazon was supposedly uninhabited by humans during the Ice Age and remainedso until less than 1,000 years ago inevitably had a chronic impact on researchpriorities and research funding. The result, relative to its importance inglobal ecology and its enormous land area, is that very little archaeology hasbeen done in the Amazon basin at all and very little of what has been done—trulya tiny fraction—focuses on Ice Age occupation levels.A refreshing exception, however, is the work of the ever open-minded AnnaCurtenius Roosevelt, currently professor of anthropology at the University ofIllinois, whom we encountered in chapter 11. On April 19, 1996, she and a groupof coresearchers took to the pages of Science to publish the results of theirstudy of Pedra Pintada, another beautifully painted rock shelter in Brazil butthis time located right in the heart of the Amazon basin at the confluence ofthe Tapajos and Amazon Rivers.29 [part0050.html#note473]Image Missing [../images/00047.jpeg]Here Roosevelt and her team excavated multiple occupation layers spanning theHolocene (our current era) and the late Pleistocene (the Ice Age), with theoldest and deepest turning out possibly to be as old as 16,000 years (accordingto thermoluminescence dating) and 14,200 years (according to radiocarbondating).30 [part0050.html#note474]Conclusion?The human presence in Caverna de Pedra Pintada during the late Pleistocene isestablished by numerous artifacts. … The dated materials are associated instratigraphic context at the beginning of a long cultural sequence. There is nopre-human biological material that could have mixed with the cultural remains,which are stratigraphically separated from later Holocene assemblages by aculturally sterile layer. … The discovery of Palaeoindians along the Amazonconfirms earlier evidence that the Palaeoindian radiation was more complex thancurrent theories provide for.31 [part0050.html#note475]Indeed so! And even in these days of man-made ecological disaster let us remindourselves that 5.5 million square kilometers of the Amazon basin is stillcovered by rainforest. To put that in perspective, picture Mexico, Guatemala,Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador. Taken together they encompass 2.22 millionsquare kilometers32 [part0050.html#note476]—not nearly enough—so we will need toadd on India with its 2.97 million square kilometers to get an imaginary realmalmost equivalent in size to the Amazon rainforest.33 [part0050.html#note477] Mypoint here is that when we consider the Amazon as an archaeological project, itsscale is comparable to Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, El Salvador, ANDIndia all added together, and all, in addition, entirely covered by denserainforest and therefore difficult and expensive to access. Moreover, unlikeMexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador, where the famous Mayacivilization flourished, and unlike India with its ancient cities and temples,there was, as we’ve seen, no inducement for archaeologists to invest scarce timeand money on excavations in the Amazon while it was believed that nothing ofgreat interest would be found there. At the close of the second decade of thetwenty-first century no serious archaeologists are still thinking that way! Thestate of affairs they’ve inherited, however, means that huge swaths of theAmazon, encompassing millions of square kilometers, have never been subject toany kind of archaeological investigation at all.This is a wider problem than the Amazon. For example, sea level rose 120 meterswhen the Ice Age came to an end with the result that 27 million squarekilometers of land that was above water at the last glacial maximum 21,000 yearsago is under water today.34 [part0050.html#note478] These submerged continentalshelves were prime seafront real estate during the Ice Age, yet only a few tinyslivers of them have ever been subject to any kind of marine archaeologicalinvestigation. Again, this is because, like the Amazon, access requires specialpreparations, equipment, and transportation and also because of a similar beliefthat whatever would be found as a result of these costly investigations wouldnot add greatly to what is already known.I’ll say nothing about Antarctica, with its 14 million square kilometersentirely virgin to the archaeologist’s spade.35 [part0050.html#note479] Thealmost universal agreement that humans could never have lived there in the pastmight or might not be correct, but we’ll never know for sure unless we look.We do know that the Sahara desert, presently occupying an area of about 9million square kilometers,36 [part0050.html#note480] had a very differentclimate during the Ice Age, and in the early millennia of the Holocene, than itexperiences today and that there were long periods when it was well watered andfertile, with extensive lakes and grasslands and abundant wildlife.37[part0050.html#note481] It is near enough to Egypt and the other great centersof early civilization in North Africa and the Middle East to have attracted theattention of archaeologists, but like the Amazon and like the submergedcontinental shelves, access is difficult and expensive, placing seriouspractical limits on what can be achieved.Part of our predicament, therefore, as a species with amnesia, is that hugeareas of the planet that we know for sure were used by and lived upon by ourancestors—the submerged continental shelves, the Sahara desert, the Amazonrainforest—have, for a variety of practical and ideological reasons, been badlyserved by archaeology. The truth is, we know VERY little about the realprehistory of any of these places, and the tiny patches that have thus far beensurveyed and excavated within them are no legitimate basis upon which to drawconclusions and express certainties about the vast areas that remain unsurveyedand unexcavated.Guatemala, in central America, was one of the six countries I suggested we puttogether to envisage the scale of the Amazon rainforest. Guatemala itselfencompasses just under 109,000 square kilometers.38 [part0050.html#note482] It’san indication of how pointless it is to take any so-called facts about the pastfor granted, however, that even in this tiny country, fifty times smaller thanthe Amazon, a huge archaeological surprise was unveiled in 2018.“Everything is turned on its head,” commented Ithaca College archaeologistThomas Garrison on the results of a survey of 2,100 square kilometers ofGuatemala’s densely forested northern Peten region.39 [part0050.html#note483]Deploying Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) pulsed laser technology, what thesurvey revealed, in areas quite close to known and even famous and well-visitedMayan sites such as Tikal, were more than 60,000 previously unsuspected ancienthouses, palaces, defensive walls, fortresses, and other structures as well asquarries, elevated highways connecting urban centers, and complex irrigation andterracing systems that would have been capable of supporting intensiveagriculture.40 [part0050.html#note484] Previously scholars had believed thatonly scattered city-states had existed in an otherwise sparsely populatedregion, but the Lidar images make it clear, as Garrison puts it, that “scale andpopulation density had been grossly underestimated.”41 [part0050.html#note485]Katheryn Reese-Taylor, a University of Calgary archaeologist, adds:After decades of combing through the forests, no archaeologists had stumbledacross these sites. More importantly, we never had the big picture that thisdata gives us. It really pulls back the veil and helps us see the civilizationas the ancient Maya saw it.42 [part0050.html#note486]When pulling back the veil on the relatively recent Maya civilization in a smallpart of the tiny country of Guatemala can produce so many surprises, we maybegin to imagine what “big picture” might come to light if the vastly larger andmore opaque veil that has covered the Amazon rainforest for so long were to bedrawn back.Hopefully the interest will be there and the funds made available for it to bedrawn back thoroughly using the latest scanning technologies followed up by sitesurveys and excavations. Until that happens, however, no archaeologist is in anyposition to dismiss the possibility that the very old and very troublesomeAustralo-Melanesian genetic signal that has been detected among Amazonianpopulations might have gotten there by the “most parsimonious” route—namely, bya direct crossing of the Pacific from Australasia to South America.That, in turn, would imply a civilization capable of great oceanic voyages andtherefore by definition at a much more advanced stage of development thanarchaeologists are prepared to accept for any branch of humanity during the IceAge."},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00048.jpeg]BLACK EARTHIT SEEMS TO ME TO be no longer in doubt that civilizations with true cities andmature polities did flourish in the Amazon before the European conquest. Lessclear is how far back the story of these civilizations can be traced in thisimmense region where so little archaeology has been done.Thanks to Anna Roosevelt’s work we know, at the very least, that humans werepresent at Pedra Pintada at the Tapajoz/Amazon confluence by about 14,000 yearsago and possibly significantly earlier.1 [part0050.html#note487] With other moreaccessible painted rock shelters in Brazil dating back as much as 50,000 years,it is, I suspect, only a matter of time before evidence of at least equallygreat if not greater antiquity emerges from the Amazon itself.But greater antiquity of what? Was it foragers and hunter-gatherers all the wayback? Or was some advanced but unseen presence capable of spanning the globe atwork behind the scenes of prehistory that might help to explain how Australasiangenes reached the Amazon during the Ice Age? Again, the problem is complicatedby the fact that few archaeologists other than Roosevelt have looked forevidence of humans in the Amazon at all at such a remote period, so we have verylittle to go on across thousands of years during which the data are sketchy andinconclusive.But then out of that opaque interlude in the life of the prehistoric Amazon,quite suddenly and unexpectedly, the lineaments of a great mystery begin tomaterialize. It concerns the “exemplary agronomy” that UCLA’s Professor DavidWilkinson cites as his two-word explanation for how the cities of the rainforestwere able to feed their large populations—because rainforests in general do nothave good base soils but sustain their fertility in the mulch of plants andleaves above ground.2 [part0050.html#note488] This is why, when areas of theAmazon are cleared for agriculture today—for example, to make way for soybeanplantations—they become exhausted, infertile, and useless after only a fewyears.3 [part0050.html#note489] But Wilkinson is not speaking of the base soils.His “exemplary agronomy,” as we shall see, refers to an artificial, man-madesoil that first suddenly and inexplicably appeared in the Amazon many thousandsof years ago but that has such miraculous properties of self-regeneration thatit is still in use for agriculture and still incredibly productive today.It is called Terra preta. More than any other single factor, it is nowunderstood by scholars to have been responsible for the astonishing and utterlyanomalous agricultural productivity that allowed a population estimated atbetween 8 and 20 million people4 [part0050.html#note490] to thrive for untoldepochs in the Amazon before being overtaken by the cataclysm of the Europeanconquest.Terra preta feels like the work of scientists, but if there was a civilizationin the Amazon, then why should we be surprised to find scientific achievementsto its credit?THE MYSTERYTHE EXISTENCE OF TERRA PRETA was first reported by Europeans in colonial-periodBrazil who called it terra preta de Índio (Indian Black Earth), “the referenceto ‘Indians’ reflecting the presence of abundant pottery shards of evidentpre-Columbian age on the surface of most known exemplars.”5[part0050.html#note491] Today these special soils, described by onenineteenth-century explorer as consisting of “a fine, dark loam, a foot, andoften two feet thick,”6 [part0050.html#note492] are more often spoken of as“Black Earth,” “Amazonian Anthropogenic Dark Earths,”7 [part0050.html#note493]or simply as “Amazonian Dark Earths”—ADEs for short.8 [part0050.html#note494]Whatever we call them though, what are they, and why do they matter?We’ve seen how, across immense areas, the natural terra firme (non-floodplain)soils of the Amazon are too poor to sustain intensive agriculture and thus tofeed the large-scale populations that we now know inhabited the region inpre-Columbian times:With few available nutrients and having extremely high aluminum concentrations,one could not imagine a worse regime for productive agriculture.9[part0050.html#note495]Indeed, the consensus of scholars is that even the floodplains with their bettersoils are high-risk areas for crop production “because of the unpredictabilityof the flood regime.”10 [part0050.html#note496]But, and it’s a big but, what are we to make of those early explorers’ reportsof dense settlements extending for kilometers along river bluff edges whenceroadways branched out into the interior?The remnants of some of these settlements are now being investigated bytwenty-first-century researchers, no longer blinded by the prejudices of thepast, who often refer to them as “garden cities” of the Amazon.11[part0050.html#note497] Invariably it turns out that they are associated, as oneauthoritative study puts it, with large acreages of “‘Indian black earth’ orterra preta. The heightened fertility status of these soils, generically termed‘dark earths …’ has long been recognized by the indigenous inhabitants of theregion, as well as by current colonists.”12 [part0050.html#note498]Across the rainforest there are many thousands of expanses of terra preta on asimilar range of scales, covering a total area that is in all honesty unknownbut that various authorities have guesstimated at 6,000 km2, 18,000 km2, 154,063km2, and “an area the size of France” (i.e., around 640,000 km2).13[part0050.html#note499] Whatever the true figure, these widely scattered plotsof ADE—the rediscovered remnants of a once much more extensive system—are indeedactively sought out and productively cultivated by indigenous people to thisday.In the southeastern Amazon along the Xingu River, to give just one example, arecent study found that existing settlements, though on a much smaller scalethan in the past, are still able to survive largely because of theaccomplishments of their ancestors who had “continuously occupied, managed andmodified” the soils over thousands of years. Almost without exception theriverine people of the Xingu today “inhabit and plant in dark earths,” and makeuse of resources, such as “Brazil nuts, babassu palm, dark earths and vineforests” that are “indicators or products of this earlier occupation.” Indeed,as Stephen Schwartzman, the research team leader, maintains, “Contemporary landuse and resource management in the Xingu corridor is … significantly conditionedor made possible by mostly little-studied prehistoric land-use practices.”14[part0050.html#note500]Particularly little studied and poorly understood are the practices thatresulted in the so far unexplained inception in the Amazon, a very long timeago, of the incredibly fertile ADEs themselves. Nobody doubts that they are“anthropogenic”—man-made in some way15 [part0050.html#note501]—and everyoneagrees that they’re an amazing success story. So fecund is terra preta, evenafter thousands of years of use, that it can still regenerate barren soils it isadded to, and has been described as “miracle earth.”16 [part0050.html#note502]The important questions therefore, are how was terra preta made, why was itmade, when was it made, and who made it?Part of the answer to the first question is often dug up by villagers along theXingu River. In (and characteristic of) the patches of ancient terra preta wherethey plant their crops they “regularly encounter potsherds, stone axes, ceramicsand figurines.”17 [part0050.html#note503]Such “refuse” left behind by people of the remote past, seems to play animportant role in the amazing fertility of the ADEs—but then so do all the otherstrangely jumbled and juxtaposed ingredients that typically also includecompost, the feces and urine of humans and animals, and all sorts of organic“kitchen” waste, including bones, notably fish bones.Most researchers believe that terra preta soils formed as composted materialaccumulated via incidental human activity (often in debris piles referred to asmiddens).18 [part0050.html#note504]University of São Paulo archaeologist Eduardo Neves reportedly favors a scenarioin which successive generations could have swept food refuse—especially fish andanimal bones—from their dwellings and then added human and animal excrement.19[part0050.html#note505]Elsewhere, in a paper published in the Journal of Archaeological Science inFebruary 2014, Neves, Michael Heckenberger, and others develop this ideafurther. Their argument depicts the ancient Amazonians as living amid ashitscape (euphemistically referred to as a “middenscape”),20[part0050.html#note506] dumping their excretions, rubbish, broken crockery, andfish bones into the middens and—most importantly—burning wet vegetation on topof the middens, and always conscientiously making sure, without any long-termplanning or purpose in mind, to keep the fires damped down under a blanket ofdirt and straw.21 [part0050.html#note507]This method of cool-burning, explains Tom Miles, an expert in the combustion andgasification of biomass,22 [part0050.html#note508] is known as“slash-and-char”—to distinguish it from the widely condemned “slash-and-burn”:In slash-and-burn, dry brush and grass are burned in open fires, spewing vastquantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and leaving only small amountsof nutrients in the ash that’s then dug into the ground.By contrast, slash-and-char involves burning wet vegetation, so it smouldersunderneath a layer of dirt and straw. Robbed of oxygen, the fire only partlyburns any wood or stalks, leaving most as tiny chunks of charcoal. This bio-charis turned into the soil.23 [part0050.html#note509]In due course—entirely incidentally and accidentally according to mostproponents of such views—these stinking, smouldering middens spread andalchemically transformed themselves into ADE, “the world’s most fertile soil,”24[part0050.html#note510] without any deliberate human intervention at all.I’d say it’s an unlikely story!I can’t prove it but my bet is that terra preta is not an accidental by-productof shit, fish bones, broken pots, figurines, stone ax heads, and low-temperaturefires. Just because it contains all those things doesn’t inevitably make itfortuitous. I think the evidence supports another possibility—that thisremarkable soil was invented, making excellent use of freely available localresources, as an ingenious, low-tech, and environmentally friendly way toincrease agricultural yield in areas that would otherwise not have been able tosustain agriculture, and thus large populations, even for a few decades, letalone for several thousands of years—as the Amazonian Dark Earths haveconsistently demonstrated a “miraculous” ability to do.“What has been mysterious about these soils,” Professor Antoinette WinklerPrins,director for environmental studies at Johns Hopkins University, admits, “istheir ability to persist in a landscape that common ecological knowledge woulddictate they could not.25 [part0050.html#note511]… Why then have ADE’s dated tohave formed up to 2500 years ago, continued to exist?”26 [part0050.html#note512]It is not just a matter of 2,500 years ago—as we shall see, the origin of theAmazonian Dark Earths goes back much farther than that—but here’s how Dr.WinklerPrins answers her own question:The unique nature of the carbon in these soils is the key to the stability ofthe organic matter in ADE’s and the key to the mystery of the persistence ofADE’s in this landscape.27 [part0050.html#note513]There appears—exceptionally—to be universal agreement among scientists on onepoint. This is that the explanation for all the useful qualities of terra preta“lies in large part with the char (or biochar) that gives the soil its darkness”and that is produced, as Tom Miles explained, by the smouldering (rather thanhot burning) of organic matter in an oxygen-poor environment. The results arenot properly understood, but, according to Nature, “The particles of charproduced this way are somehow able to gather up nutrients and water that mightotherwise be washed down below the reach of roots.”28 [part0050.html#note514]William Balée, professor of anthropology at Tulane University, confirms theseobservations, adding that “microbial activity leads to increased carbonsequestration,” and that “ADE is richer and more diverse in microbes thansurrounding soils, even though millions of these species remain to be identifiedprecisely, and literally a million separate taxa can be contained in only 10grams of soil. A significant proportion of the microbes in ADE are differentfrom microbes in the surrounding primeval soils.”29 [part0050.html#note515]Another authoritative study also focused on the surprising microbial vigor andutility for agricultural purposes of ADEs, noting a further connection with themanaged use of fire. “Fire contributes charcoal and ash, which increase soil pH,thereby suppressing aluminum activity toxic to plant roots and soilmicrobiota.”30 [part0050.html#note516]What is more, fire increases the capacity of the soils to retain nutrients, thusmaintaining a “synergistic cycle of continued fertility.”31[part0050.html#note517]In summary, concedes Professor WinklerPrins, the microbial complexes associatedwith ADEs are “poorly understood” and “quite mysterious actually.”32[part0050.html#note518] Likewise, even the authors of the shitscape/middenscapetheory of ADE formation admit that “despite the importance of research on terrapreta, we still lack a firm understanding of the specific formation processesthat led to the diversity inherent in these anthrosols.”33[part0050.html#note519]Yet all this mystery, all this effectiveness, all this efficiency, and all theseremarkable contributions to welfare, we are asked to believe, came about asincidental by-products of human activity? They just happened—without anyplanning, or deliberation, or design at all?I could see immediately why such ideas would give comfort to archaeologistswhose roller-coaster ride thus far has taken them from a position where they hadconvinced themselves and their students that there could never have been anycities in the Amazon, to a position where they must now accept that theprehistoric rainforest once teemed with cities. This in itself has been atraumatic enough paradigm shift. I’m therefore not surprised that mostarchaeologists remain unwilling to go the extra mile needed to view terrapreta—that “miraculous” agent of fertility—as the product of deliberate,ingenious, organized, focused, scientific activity. It causes far less cognitivedissonance, for so naturally conservative and cautious a discipline, to concludeinstead that it was the waste and refuse of those previously contested Amazoniancities with their very large populations that had accidentally fertilized theland and made possible the otherwise anomalous boost to agriculturalproductivity that had kept the stomachs of the otherwise anomalous urbanpopulations full.But isn’t it much more likely that all this happened the other way around?Surely it makes no sense that the large populations came first. If they did, howdid they feed themselves while enough shit and fish bones were being accumulatedto create the first patches of terra preta? Isn’t it more logical that thesettlement and expansion of human populations in the Amazon was a planned affairin which the spread of terra preta was a precondition for the development oflarge settlements rather than a consequence of it?Professor Balée, not an archaeologist, seems to be thinking somewhat along theselines when he cites the bizarre microbial differences between ADEs and theoriginal, unenhanced soils that surround them as evidence for a deliberate human“contribution to microbial diversity in the Amazon, a remarkably intriguing andstill living, even evolving legacy of the pre-Columbian Dark Earth people.”34[part0050.html#note520]REMARKABLE AND PRECOCIOUS SCIENCEAS WITH SO MUCH ELSE that concerns the Amazon, the issue of when, exactly, terrapreta first began to be created continues to be fogged by confusion anduncertainty.A casual glance through the scientific literature might leave the reader withthe impression that these exceptionally fertile anthropogenic soils are aphenomenon of the past 3,000 years only—with the great bulk of terra pretacreation taking place between about 1,000 years ago and the time of the Europeanconquest.35 [part0050.html#note521]Look closer, however, and you will discover that many of the same authoritiesare tiptoeing around the edges of another mystery here.For example, while reemphasizing their satisfaction with the idea that AmazonianDark Earths are “produced by human habitation but unintentionally,”36[part0050.html#note522] and noting that ADE formation “ceased in most, if notall, parts of Amazonia during the early Contact period,” Eduardo Neves and hiscolleagues concede that “the initiation of ADE formation has been more difficultto explain so far.”37 [part0050.html#note523]They choose to focus on the period from around 2,500 to 2,000 years ago butcaution that earlier sites may have disappeared due to the dynamic landscapeprocesses of the Amazon, or perhaps because “the soil organic matter in mostolder ADE sites has been mineralized, leaving only inorganic artifacts behind,without coloration of the substrate by organic matter, and thus, early sites areunder-represented.”38 [part0050.html#note524]But by no means all of the earlier sites have disappeared. Enough of the olderplots remain for several of the leading authorities to agree that 2,500 yearsago is nowhere near the beginning of the story. Neves himself accepts theexistence of much older ADE sites, notably “the sites of the so-calledMassangana phase … dated ca. 4,800 BP.”39 [part0050.html#note525]These sites, which are about 300 years older than the orthodox date for theconstruction of the Great Pyramid of Giza, are located in southeast Amazonia inthe Jamari River area. Unfortunately, they are no longer accessible, having beenflooded by the construction of the Samuel hydroelectric dam.40[part0050.html#note526] It seems, however, that there are even older ADEs. Inthe Proceedings of the Royal Society, for example, Neves and others report BlackEarths that are between 5,000 and 6,000 years old.41 [part0050.html#note527]Elsewhere—in no less august a journal than Nature—we read of ADEs that “arethought to be 7000 years old.”42 [part0050.html#note528]Nor does the trail leading back to humanity’s time of amnesia quite fade fromview even there. Specialists from Cornell University’s Department of Crop andSoil Sciences, joined by Eduardo Neves and citing his “unpublished data,”conclude in the Journal of the Soil Science Society of America that the man-madeDark Earths of the Amazon in fact date back as far as 8,700 years ago.43[part0050.html#note529]And again, Neves’s own caution must surely apply—that even older sites than thismay very well once have existed but have disappeared with the passage of time.Given the incredible longevity of this soil and its extraordinary ability toregenerate its own fertility through microbial action, it is by no means beyondthe bounds of reason to suppose that plots of terra preta dating back to thelast Ice Age might still exist somewhere in the millions of square kilometers ofthe rainforest that have never been investigated by archaeologists at all.44[part0050.html#note530]What is certain, however, is that a remarkable and precocious skill andcompetence in soil science—“exemplary agronomy” in Professor David Wilkinson’sphrase—leaves its fingerprints in the Amazon at least 8,700 years ago. Afterthat (and for how long before that we do not know) its use becomes integratedinto the harmonious and successful lifeways of ancient Amazonian civilization.This civilization thrives for millennia, long outlasting ancient Egypt andancient Mesopotamia, doing very well for itself and for its people in just aboutevery possible way, until the catastrophe of European contact that not onlysubjects it to genocide by sword and by epidemic, but also conspires to deny itsvery existence for centuries thereafter.Reader, please note—when I speak of an “ancient Amazonian civilization” I am notunder any circumstances claiming that this was the lost civilization I havespent much of my working life trying to track down! My suggestion, rather, isthat, in weighing what happened in the Amazon from the Ice Age until theEuropean conquest, we may find that certain striking anomalies such as themysterious Australasian genetic signal, and indeed the Amazonian Dark Earthsthemselves, bear the fingerprints of that world-exploring, world-encompassing,world-measuring lost civilization of prehistoric antiquity. More specifically,the proposition we are presently considering in this context is that thesettlement and expansion of human populations in the Amazon was a planned affairin which the spread of terra preta was a precondition for the development oflarge population centers rather than a consequence of it.It was, in other words, not something random at all but an integral part of acarefully thought-out project."},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00049.jpeg]GARDENING EDENFURTHER INTRIGUING HINTS THAT SOME sort of intelligent, guided project wasmounted in the Amazon thousands of years ago are to be found in recent studiesof the species of trees that populate the rainforest. These studies demonstratethat far from being a “pristine” natural environment, the Amazon is largely ahuman creation.Anna Roosevelt, whose sometimes radical views we’ve already encountered,criticizes other scientists for assuming—all too often—that the Amazon’s forestsare entirely works of nature “without conducting research to exclude a humaninfluence.”1 [part0050.html#note531]When that research is done, it turns out that while “Amazonian forests indifferent regions differ significantly from one another in topography, climate,geology, hydrology, structure, seasonality, and history,” they nonetheless“often resemble each other” in showing a “pattern of unexpected dominance anddensity of a small group of plant species. This pattern has been found whereverAmazon forests have been inventoried and has yet to be explained by naturalfactors.”2 [part0050.html#note532]The best current estimate is that the Amazon is presently home to about 16,000woody tree species. Out of this total, however, “only 227 hyperdominant speciesdominate Amazonian forests.”3 [part0050.html#note533] These so-called oligarchs(from the Greek for “rule by a few”) “make up only 1.4% of all the Amazon forestspecies but almost half of the trees in any given forest.”4[part0050.html#note534]In 2017 a large international team of ecologists and archaeologists, led byenvironmental science researcher Carolina Levis of Wageningen University in theNetherlands, completed a study looking into this peculiar pattern ofdistribution. What immediately stood out in their data was that, among theoligarchs, “domesticated species are five times more likely than nondomesticatedspecies to be hyperdominant.”5 [part0050.html#note535]Moreover, in almost every case where clusters of hyperdominants wereinventoried, ancient archaeological sites were found among them6[part0050.html#note536]—a correlation so frequent and reliable that the presenceand concentration of oligarchs could, in theory, be used to “predict theoccurrence of archaeological sites in Amazonian forests.”7[part0050.html#note537]The team’s detailed analysis, published in Science, therefore concludes that“modern tree communities in Amazonia are structured to an important extent by along history of plant domestication by Amazonian peoples. … Detecting thewidespread effect of ancient societies in modern forests … strongly refutesideas of Amazonian forests being untouched by man. Domestication shapesAmazonian forests.”8 [part0050.html#note538]We’ve seen that the question of exactly when human beings first arrived in theAmazon remains to be settled. So, too, does the question of exactly when theybegan to domesticate trees. The team’s results suggest that “past humaninterventions had an important and lasting role in the distribution ofdomesticated species found in modern forests, despite the fact that the locationof many archaeological sites is unknown.”9 [part0050.html#note539] On presentevidence, however, adds Levis, all that can be said with certainty is that atsome point “more than 8,000 years ago,” Amazonian people were already focusingattention on certain trees that were particularly useful to them.They really cultivated and planted these species in their home gardens, in theforests they were managing.10 [part0050.html#note540]Among the favored species mentioned in the Science paper, now all hyperdominant,are Bertholletia excelsa (the Brazil nut tree), Inga edulis (“Ice-Cream Bean,” afruit tree), Pourouma cecropiifolia (“Amazon Grape,” a fruit tree), Pouteriacaimito (the abiu, a fruit tree), and Theobroma cacao (the cocoatree—chocolate).11 [part0050.html#note541]Other prized Amazonian species domesticated in ancient times include the açaipalm and tucuma palm, the peach palm, the Cupuaçu tree, the cashew tree, and therubber tree.12 [part0050.html#note542]A MAJOR CENTER OF CROP DOMESTICATIONAS I RESEARCHED THIS MATERIAL I was initially surprised to learn that cocoatrees and rubber trees, both of which I’d wrongly believed were indigenous toand had been domesticated in Mexico, were in fact originally South Americanspecies and had been domesticated in the Amazon. I was equally surprised tolearn that capsicum—chili peppers, red and green bell peppers, et cetera—which Ihad again wrongly thought were Mexican in origin, had likewise first beendomesticated in the Amazon.13 [part0050.html#note543]Indeed, though often overlooked, Amazonia has rightly been described as “a majorcenter of crop domestication” on a global scale.14 [part0050.html#note544] Priorto the European conquest, according to Charles R. Clement of Brazil’s NationalInstitute of Amazonian Research, “at least 83 native species were domesticatedto some degree, including manioc, sweet potato, cacao, tobacco, pineapple andhot peppers, as well as numerous fruit trees and palms, and at least another 55imported neotropical species were cultivated.”15 [part0050.html#note545]Pineapples! There was another surprise for me, as I had (again wrongly) alwaysassumed that these tropical fruits grow on trees and had their origins in somePacific archipelago, perhaps Hawaii. In fact, the pineapple plant with its long,spiky leaves, is not a tree. It grows close to the ground (with each plantproducing a single pineapple), belongs to the Bromeliad family, and isindigenous to, and was first domesticated in, the Amazon rainforest.16[part0050.html#note546]There is no firm information on when domestication was undertaken, but inCharles Clements’s view, “The widespread distribution of the pineapple in theAmericas at the time of the European conquest, the diversity and quality of thecultivars, not surpassed after one century of modern, intensive breeding, thediversity of uses, the economic and cultural importance of the crop, all pointto a very ancient domestication.”17 [part0050.html#note547]Out of the 83 crops native to Amazonia and the 55 “exotic” ones, a total of 138crops in all, Clements and his colleagues classify 52, including the pineapple,as fully domesticated. Of these, 14 (27 percent) are fruit or nut trees or woodyvines. Among the 41 crops classified as semi-domesticated, 35 (or 87 percent)are fruit or nut trees or woody vines. Among the 45 crops classified asincipiently domesticated, all but 1 are fruit or nut trees:18[part0050.html#note548]Overall, 68% of these Amazonian crops are trees or woody perennials. Inlandscapes largely characterized by forest, a predominance of tree crops isperhaps not surprising. Nonetheless, the most important subsistence cropdomesticated in Amazonia is an herbaceous shrub, manioc, and several otherdomesticates are also root or tuber crops, most of which are adapted tosavanna-forest transitional ecotones with pronounced dry seasons.19[part0050.html#note549]Think of it. The rainforest was coaxed, shaped, and transformed by what can onlybe described as scientific practices into a vast garden of useful and productivetrees. But trees alone cannot feed large populations, so the prehistoricdomestication program was extended on a massive scale to include agriculturalspecies that were then successfully incorporated, through the use of terrapreta, into the Amazonian ecology.THE MANIOC CONUNDRUMMANIOC, THE KEY STAPLE, “THE most important food crop that originated inAmazonia,”20 [part0050.html#note550] and on which the majority of the populationof the Amazon still depend today,21 [part0050.html#note551] is of particularinterest for a number of reasons. Molecular analysis has confirmed that thiswoody shrub, cultivated for its edible roots, was domesticated in the Amazonbasin, “most likely in the savannas, the Brazilian Cerrado, to the south of theAmazon rainforest,”22 [part0050.html#note552] and more specifically “in northernMato Grosso, Rondônia and Acre states, in Brazil, and adjacent areas of northernBolivia. Domestication must have started before 8,000 BP, as that is theearliest date reported from the Zana and Ñanchoc valleys of coastal Peru.”23[part0050.html#note553]Unlike the Amazon itself, large parts of which remain inaccessible toarchaeologists, these two coastal Peruvian valleys have been well studied,yielding, as well as manioc, “evidence for radiocarbon-dated human cultivationof squash (9240 and 7660 yr B.P.), peanut (7840 yr B.P.), quinoa (8000 and 7500yr B.P.), and cotton (5490 yr B.P.).”24 [part0050.html#note554]What is notable, however, is that all of these crops had already beendomesticated elsewhere before being grown in coastal Peru.25[part0050.html#note555]As with cocoa and chilies, I’d long been under the impression that the squashplant (cucurbita) was first domesticated in Mexico around 10,000 years ago, andindeed there is archaeological evidence to support this.26[part0050.html#note556] But now here it was turning up in Peruvian coastalvalleys 9,240 years ago, and not only there but at similar dates in the nearbysites of Paiján and Las Pircas.27 [part0050.html#note557] An authoritative studypublished in Science suggests that these cultivated Peruvian squash plants mayhave been from a line that had originally been domesticated not in Mexico but in“southwestern Ecuador and the Colombian Amazon” as early as 10,000 to 9,300years ago.28 [part0050.html#note558]What about the peanuts cultivated in the Zana and Ñanchoc valleys 7,840 yearsago? They, too, it turns out, were domesticated east of the Andes in a regionextending south from the southern edge of the Amazon basin.29[part0050.html#note559] This is broadly the same region in which manioc was alsodomesticated,30 [part0050.html#note560] and in both cases we can only go on thedates of the earliest surviving materials—currently put at around 8000 yearsBP31 [part0050.html#note561]—to guess when domestication in fact took place.Certainly it was before 8,000 years ago, but how long before is a matter largelyof conjecture and some authorities are already seeking to push the horizon backto at least 9,000 and perhaps 10,000 years ago.32 [part0050.html#note562]Manioc, also known as cassava, is a starchy crop, a good staple providing almosttwice as many calories as potatoes weight for weight.33 [part0050.html#note563]But it is also so low in protein content that, as one specialist warns, “inmanioc-dominated diets, protein-deficiency can lead to malnutrition and alsoaggravate symptoms related to manioc cyanogenic toxicity.”34[part0050.html#note564]We’ll return to that issue of toxicity in a moment but let’s note, meanwhile,that peanuts have a very high protein content that makes them a perfectnutritional “complement to starchy manioc-based diets.”35[part0050.html#note565] Several authorities have noticed the pairing of the twoin ancient cultures and British botanist Barbara Pickersgill speculates that thewide prehistoric distribution of peanut cultivation may have accompanied thespread and uptake of manioc.36 [part0050.html#note566]Again I can’t help but wonder if there might not have been something more activeand intentional at work behind the scenes of this process than mere“accompanying.” What I have in mind is the possibility that a deep knowledge ofplants and of their nutritional and other properties might have preceeded thefirst domestication activities that we have evidence for. Surely it is only onthe basis of such foreknowledge that crops like groundnuts and manioc could beselected, domesticated, planned, and planted to complement each other’snutritional contribution to human welfare?This is pure speculation, of course. But it’s strengthened somewhat by thecurious nature of the manioc roots themselves, which (although there are manyvarieties) are classified into two main categories—“bitter” and “sweet.” Allcontain compounds known as cyanogenic glucosides, found in low concentrations inthe less popular sweet varieties and in very high concentrations in the greatlyprized and more widely used bitter varieties.37 [part0050.html#note567] Theneed-to-know element here is that if you eat any of the “bitter” varieties,without first processing them in the correct way (extracting the glucosides),you will at least suffer from “cyanic intoxication, with symptoms like vomiting,dizziness, and paralysis,” if not die of cyanide poisoning.38[part0050.html#note568]Ignorant of this, several of the soldiers on Francisco de Orellana’ssixteenth-century voyage down the Amazon ate unprocessed manioc roots. Theysurvived but became mightily sick, near to death, as a result.39[part0050.html#note569] To avoid poisoning they would have had to peel theroots, then grate them, then strain and press the resulting mash to remove thehydrocyanic acid, and at last toast it to produce a fine faintly yellowishflour40 [part0050.html#note570]—simple but absolutely essential procedures thatthe indigenous peoples of the Amazon have followed for thousands of years tomake “bitter” manioc safe.The fundamental question, however, is exactly how and when this processingsystem was first devised? Obviously since we have evidence of the cultivation ofdomesticated manioc by 8,000, or perhaps even as much as 10,000 years ago, itfollows that the ability to process it must already have been developed by then.It would make no sense to anybody to go to all the trouble of domesticating aspecies and then growing crops from that species that nobody could eat withoutgetting horribly, and perhaps lethally, sick. That’s why I keep coming back tothe haunting possibility that some person or group of people with an interest inthe Amazon already understood the potentials of manioc—and the exact steps thatwould have to be taken to avoid its dangers—long before they ever chose todomesticate it and put it under cultivation.41 [part0050.html#note571]Otherwise, frankly … why bother?PLANT GNOSISTHE MANIOC ISSUE LOOKS SIMPLE. You just need to peel it, grate it, soak it,strain it, and meticulously cook it to remove the poison, and it is transformedinto a useful staple.42 [part0050.html#note572] All steps of the processing seemrather obvious and basic in retrospect, but consider the amount of trial anderror—the number of volunteers you would have had to make sick or kill—beforeyou arrived at the right method.And what would motivate you to start such a project in the first place, unlessyou already knew the potential of the wild progenitor that would eventuallybecome domesticated manioc?The same problem looms on an even larger and more complex scale with otherplants of the Amazon, the uses to which they are put, and the processing theyrequire. Anthropologist Jeremy Narby, author of The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and theOrigins of Knowledge, draws attention to curare, the blow-gun and arrow poison,invented—we do not know when—in the ancient Amazon. It produces paralysis anddeath by asphyxiation as the muscles required for breathing cease to function.It is used, Narby explains, because “it kills tree-borne animals withoutpoisoning their meat while causing them to relax their grip and fall to theground. Monkeys, when hit with an untreated arrow, tend to wrap their tailsaround branches and die out of the archer’s reach.”43 [part0050.html#note573]A very useful hunting aid, therefore, and one, moreover, that has been adoptedinto modern medical anesthesiology. But the real mystery, as Narby goes on toshow us, is how it was ever invented in the first place. The consensus amongscholars is that curare, of which there are forty types in the Amazon made fromseventy plant species, was stumbled upon by chance experimentation.44[part0050.html#note574] Narby doubts this scenario:To produce it, it is necessary to combine several plants and boil them forseventy-two hours, while avoiding the fragrant but mortal vapors emitted by thebroth. The final product is a paste that is inactive unless injected under theskin. If swallowed, it has no effect. It is difficult to see how anybody couldhave stumbled on this recipe by chance experimentation.45[part0050.html#note575]The whole mystery of the Amazonian plant medicines, notably the vision-inducingbrew ayahuasca (which itself is a mixture of several plants that are mostunlikely to have been fortuitously brought together) is explored in depth in my2005 book Supernatural: Meetings with the Ancient Teachers of Mankind. In thesemedicines, as in curare, as in terra preta, and as in the incredible burst ofdomestication of plants and trees in the Amazon that followed the end of the IceAge, could we be looking at the cultural DNA not only of a civilization but of asophisticated civilization that had developed sciences of its own that it beganto share with other people—very much including the peoples of the Amazonbasin—around the time that the last Ice Age came cataclysmically to its end?Judging from the clues that lie scattered like tantalizing jewels across theAmazon, this hypothetical lost science of a hypothetical lost civilization wouldhave looked very different from any of our own sciences, employing not onlyempirical methods but also shamanistic techniques, vision quests, and out ofbody encounters in the “spirit world” that most modern Western intellectualswould regard as absurd. Again, however, if we go by the evidence of the Amazon,the plain fact is that the remnants and borrowings of this supposedly laughableform of science have again and again produced practical and down-to-earthresults—domesticating and processing huge numbers of plants and trees, forexample, or creating “miracle” soils that are still fertile after thousands ofyears of use, or inventing muscle relaxants like curare that inhibitacetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. Moreover, unlike Westerntechnology, to which the earth is a dead thing, this ancient technologyaddresses all the needs, spiritual as well as physical, of the human creature.Again, though the skeptics will scoff, none of the many thousands of peoplewho’ve had their lives transformed by ayahuasca in the past 20 years would denythat something very powerful and very hard to explain is at work here.46[part0050.html#note576]"},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00050.jpeg]SACRED GEOMETRYFROM THE TIME OF ITS earliest appearance in the archaeological record (which isabsolutely not the same thing as the time that it first took shape) Amazoniancivilization is a continuum that does not break from the wisdom and insights ofits founders. The same basic principles, defining the relationship betweenhumanity and the cosmos continue to manifest and to be re-expressed overthousands upon thousands of years, in some cases evolving and developing intostrange new growths, in others devolving and decaying. But just like thatenigmatic Australasian genetic signal still found among Amazonian peoples today,other traces of ancient and mysterious connections, though faint, have alsosurvived.For example, despite rejecting the old stereotypes of the “savage” and“primitive” Amazon, and despite knowing that prehistoric civilizations of somecomplexity had once flourished there, scientists at the beginning of thetwenty-first century were nonetheless taken aback to be presented withoverwhelming evidence of an ancient practice of geometry in the rainforest—andon a very ambitious scale.Let’s get one thing straight before we take a closer look at this mystery. Justbecause people live in a dense jungle, and haven’t attended math classes in highschool, does not mean they have no grasp of geometry—“one of the deepest andoldest products of human reason.”1 [part0050.html#note577] On the contrary,though often wrongly attributed to Euclid, there is compellingevidence—mysterious in itself—that “the conceptual principles of geometry areinherent in the human mind.”2 [part0050.html#note578] This evidence comes froman isolated region at the heart of the Amazon where scientists from theCognitive Neuroimaging Unit of the Collège de France led a study in which theindigenous Mundurukú people were tested on basic geometry skills. The studyfound that:Mundurukú children and adults spontaneously made use of … the core concepts oftopology (e.g., connectedness), Euclidean geometry (e.g., line, point,parallelism, and right angle), and basic geometrical figures (e.g., square,triangle, and circle) … and they used distance, angle, and sense relationshipsin geometrical maps to locate hidden objects.3 [part0050.html#note579]In summary, therefore, isolated peoples in remote parts of the Amazon today,whose contact with technological civilization is extremely limited,4[part0050.html#note580] possess innate geometrical knowledge and are able todeploy it “independently of instruction, experience with maps, or measurementdevices.”5 [part0050.html#note581] No doubt their ancestors, and probably mosthumans always, have been blessed with the same neurological gift. Indeed, we seeit made manifest down the ages in all kinds of man-made structures. Even thesimplest wattle-and-daub hovels tend to be rectangular or square rather thanrandomly shaped. Likewise, from England’s Stonehenge, to the Great Pyramid ofEgypt, to India’s Madurai Meenakshi Temple, to Borobudur in Indonesia, to AngkorWat in Cambodia, to Tikal in Guatemala, to Tiahuanaco in Bolivia—and tocountless other sites too numerous to mention—the design of the sacredarchitecture of the world is entirely governed by geometry.The very universality of this geometry, as an innate faculty of the human mind,is not in doubt, but how it has been expressed by different civilizations indifferent epochs is culturally driven. Thus, Angkor Wat is not the Great Pyramidand the Great Pyramid is not Stonehenge. All three, however, share the samefundamental geometries and connections to the cosmos that—I have longargued—were incorporated into a system of architecture central to the beliefsand lifeways of a lost civilization of remotest prehistory. When thatcivilization was destroyed in the series of cataclysms that brought the last IceAge to an end, there were survivors who took the system with them, seeking toreplant it in the many different parts of the world where they found refuge. Insome it took root and flowered early, and over thousands of years it manifestedin multiple different ways; in others it lay dormant for millennia beforebursting into exuberant life.Mainstream archaeology recognizes no such universal system, nor even thevestiges of one, and insists that there was no “diffusion” of ideas betweenthese ancient cultures (How could there be when Angkor is 3,500 years youngerthan the Great Pyramid?). The point is fair but irrelevant to my propositionwhich does not require diffusion within the past 5,000 or even the past 10,000years. Instead I suggest that the similarities and differences between certainancient monumental structures, created around the world at different times bydifferent cultures, are best explained by a remote common ancestor civilizationthat left a legacy of ideas and knowledge in which they all shared, which theirpriests, shamans, and sages sought to preserve, and which they in due coursedeployed in their own different ways.One of the hallmarks of this worldwide “system,” whether its widespread presenceis coincidental or not, is geometry. And, in turn, whenever the geometrymanifests on a monumental scale that could only be achieved by skilledspecialists and a large, well-organized workforce, the obvious implication isthat a fairly advanced civilization must have been involved.That was why, when giant geometrical earthworks were discovered in the RioBranco area of the Brazilian state of Acre in the southwestern Amazon in 1977nobody at first paid much attention. This was the era when the Smithsonian’sBetty Meggers still reigned supreme over all things Amazonian. Her Man andCulture in a Counterfeit Paradise had been published just 6 years before and herview that the jungle could never have supported large populations or any form ofcivilization capable of monumental architecture was the full-blown dogma of theday. Little wonder then, although the Smithsonian had sponsored the NationalProgram of Archaeological Research in the Amazon that found the first“geoglyphs,” that it did not announce the discovery until 11 years later.6[part0050.html#note582]Image Missing [../images/00051.jpeg]Locations of principal earthwork sites in the southwestern Amazon discovered by2018.The young man who actually spotted the earthworks from a Smithsonian surveyaircraft was Alceu Ranzi, and it was he who named them “geoglyphs.”7[part0050.html#note583] His career took him elsewhere for the next two decadesbut his interest was sparked again after another overflight in 1999 and, now atthe Federal University of Acre, he resumed his research together with colleaguesDenise Schaan of the Federal University of Pará and Martti Pärssinen of theUniversity of Helsinki.Their first detailed results were published in the December 2009 issue ofAntiquity,8 [part0050.html#note584] which trailed the findings as evidence ofthe existence in ancient times of “a sophisticated pre-Columbianmonument-building society in the upper Amazon Basin on the east side of theAndes. This hitherto unknown people constructed earthworks of precise geometricplan connected by straight orthogonal roads.”9 [part0050.html#note585]At the outset of the paper, Ranzi, Schaan, and Pärssinen described “clusters ofthese monumental earthworks” mostly located on a 200-meter-high plateau:Formed by excavated ditches and adjacent earthen walls … the earthworks areshaped as perfect circles, rectangles and composite figures.10[part0050.html#note586]But why had these stunning Amazonian geoglyphs first been noticed only a fewdecades previously?Ranzi and his colleagues observe that while the geoglyphs were abandoned about500 years ago, and then heavily overgrown, they have since been revealed by massclearing of the forest for the cattle industry, thus becoming visible,especially from the sky, over the past 30 years. Indeed, the enormous size ofthe geoglyphs makes it easier to distinguish their shape and configuration froman aerial perspective than at ground level, and satellite imagery has been madefreely available to researchers by Google Earth.11 [part0050.html#note587]NAZCA–AMAZON CONNECTIONSTO THE EXTENT THAT THEY are best seen and understood for what they are from theair rather than from ground level, comparisons with the famous “Nazca Lines” ofsouthern Peru were inevitable, and quickly began to be made—particularly sosince, in addition to its giant images of animals and birds, the Nazca plateaualso features many precise geometrical figures.12 [part0050.html#note588]Ranzi himself has invited the comparison by asserting that the Amazon geoglyphsare “as important as the Nazca Lines”13 [part0050.html#note589] and, indeed, hisown use of the term “geoglyphs” was, according to his colleague and coauthorDenise Schaan, inspired by the figures on the Nazca plateau. This, Schaanargues, is “unfortunate” because the Nazca Lines “are a different phenomenon. Inthe Nazca desert, geometric and zoomorphic figures were shaped by thedisplacement of dark, weathered rocks on the surface to expose a lightersubsurface. In Brazil and Bolivia, however, the ‘figures’ were produced by theexcavation of large, continuous ditches forming circles, rectangles, hexagons,octagons and other, nongeometric, shapes.”14 [part0050.html#note590]Image Missing [../images/00052.jpeg]Nazca geometry. PHOTOS: SANTHA FAIIA.I’m not persuaded by this distinction. Whether a painter uses oils orwatercolors, the end result is still a painting. Likewise, although differenttechniques and materials were used—unavoidable given the very differentenvironmental conditions of the Amazon and at Nazca—the end result in both casesis still a “canvas” decorated with immense geometric, as well as “nongeometric,”shapes.Though it is now more than quarter of a century in the past, I recall vividly myencounter with Maria Reiche, the venerable “lady of the lines,” at her home inthe town of Nazca where she had lived since 1945 surrounded by the ancientgeoglyphs that it was her fate to study, protect, and introduce to the world.She had recently celebrated her ninetieth birthday when Santha and I met her inJune 1993. Although bedridden with advanced Parkinsonism, her mind was sharp andher voice clear when she shared with us her own view of the significance of thelines:They teach us that our whole idea of the peoples of antiquity is wrong—that herein Peru was a civilization that was advanced, that had an advanced understandingof mathematics and astronomy, and that was a civilization of artists expressingsomething unique about the human spirit for future generations to comprehend.15[part0050.html#note591]I have already explored the mystery of Nazca in previous books so I won’t goover old ground here except to note that among the most iconic of the Nazcageoglyphs, etched into the desert with a single unbroken line extending for morethan a mile16 [part0050.html#note592] and occupying an area of approximately 90meters by 60 meters17 [part0050.html#note593] is an image of a monkey. Itsprehensile tail, stylized into a spiral, is a diagnostic feature of New Worldmonkeys that distinguishes them from Old World monkeys.18[part0050.html#note594] However, no monkeys have ever lived in the Nazca desert.The nearest specimens, for example, capuchin monkeys, spider monkeys, and woollymonkeys, are all native to the Amazon rainforest.19 [part0050.html#note595]Image Missing [../images/00053.jpeg]TOP RIGHT: Nazca monkey.

BOTTOM: Nineteenth-century illustration of Amazonian spider monkeys.Another of the better-known Nazca geoglyphs looks like and is usually referredto as a spider. It has been suggested, however, that the huge 46-meter-long20[part0050.html#note596] image arguably does not depict a spider but a member ofa closely related order of millimeter-sized arachnids, the “tickspiders” calledRicinulei.21 [part0050.html#note597] More than seventy species have thus farbeen identified worldwide, not one of them in the Nazca desert. Nor should weexpect any there. Ricinulei favor “tropical forests and caves”22[part0050.html#note598] and the nearest populations of this very peculiarcreature to Nazca are in the Brazilian Amazon, specifically in central, eastern,and southern Amazonia.23 [part0050.html#note599]There are many strange things about the Ricinulei order, but strangest of all isa single feature that is regarded as its distinguishing anatomicalcharacteristic.24 [part0050.html#note600] As described by Brazilianarachnologist Alexandre B. Bonaldo, this is its “system of sperm transfer, whichis achieved by an elaborate copulatory apparatus in the male third leg.”25[part0050.html#note601] Although barely a millimeter long, and difficult todiscern without magnification, it was first pointed out by the late professorGerald S. Hawkins of Boston University that this unusual reproductive extension,common to all Ricinulei species, is depicted in the correct place on the thirdleg of the Nazca “spider.”26 [part0050.html#note602]Hawkins, however, was an astronomer, while Bonaldo, a real expert on SouthAmerican spiders, disagrees, remarking in emails we exchanged in October 2018:The idea that the Nazca spider is a Ricinulei is kind of odd to me, since Ialways thought it was a myrmecomorphic spider such as the species of Myrmecium …Myrmecium is an exclusive South American genus, being recorded from theVenezuelan Caribbean to southern Brazil, but the majority of the species (28 outof 38) are endemic to the Amazon Basin, including lower parts of the orientalAndean slopes in Peru, Ecuador and Colombia.Image Missing [../images/00054.jpeg]LEFT: Nazca “spider.” PHOTO: SANTHA FAIIA. RIGHT: Greatly magnified, Myrmeciumfrom the Amazon. PHOTO: ARTHUR ANKER.I asked if I could quote him on this and he replied:Sure, you can quote it, if you want. I would add that that third leg“modification” shows no structures and is not bilateral. It appears to be justan extension of the drawing, as is common in other Nazca drawings.Bonaldo then kindly referred me to Arthur Anker, a colleague of his whospecializes in macrophotography, and Anker in turn provided me with the image ofMyrmecium from the Amazon (specifically from the Tambopata Reserve, near PuertoMaldonado) that is reproduced here. It is, in my view, a far better candidatefor the Nazca spider than Ricinulei—and once again what it suggests to me isthat scientists, who observed nature closely, were at work in ancient SouthAmerica. But let’s lower our sights and simply say that the monkey and “spider”figures, with their Amazonian provenance, call, at the very least, for a rethinkof Schaan’s view that the Nazca Lines and the Amazon geoglyphs are unconnectedphenomena.SOME FACTS AND FIGURES ON THE AMAZONIAN GEOGLYPHSWHAT IS THE GENERAL STRUCTURE and appearance of the geoglyphs uncovered in thesouthwestern Amazon in recent decades? In their 2009 paper in Antiquity, Schaan,Ranzi, and Pärssinen give us this broad overview:In general, the geometric figures are formed by a ditch approximately 11m wide,currently 1–3m deep, with adjacent 0.5–1m high earthen banks, formed bydeposition of the excavated soil. Ring ditches have diameters that vary from 90to 300m. … When there are two or more structures, they are usually connected byembanked roads. Some of the single rectangular structures may have short roadscoming out of their mid-sides or corners. Composite figures include a rectangleinside a circle or vice versa.27 [part0050.html#note603]Some of the figures are quite roughly executed, others are extremely exact, andin some cases an exact figure is combined with an inexact one in the samegeoglyph, as at Santa Isabel, for example, where a large well-made octagon isjuxtaposed with an imprecise circle.By contrast, the geometrically austere Fazenda Parana site is “comprised of twoperfect squares (200m and 100m wide) connected … by a 20m wide, 100m longcauseway. The two squares are further connected to straight roads leading eastand west, north and south.”28 [part0050.html#note604]Image Missing [../images/00055.jpeg]Fazenda Parana. MAP AND PHOTO: MARTTI PÄRSSINEN.Image Missing [../images/00056.jpeg]Fazenda Colorada. MAP AND PHOTO: MARTTI PÄRSSINEN.More complex by far is the Fazenda Colorada site. Its geoglyphs consist of:one circle, a quadrangle and a double ditch structure which forms a three-sidedsquare. The three-sided square double ditch is connected to a trapezoidalstructure comprised by linear walls without ditches. Its south-western corner isopen and connects to a c. 55m broad, avenue-like, road; on both sides of theentrance one can still see two high mounds, standing like towers. The road hasembankments which border both sides, and, as it extends away from the entrance,it narrows, vanishing 600m further.29 [part0050.html#note605]Then consider the site known as Fazenda Atlantica. Here the principal geoglyphforms a square measuring 250 meters along each side. Quadrants are inscribedinto the east and west corners and a circle 125 meters in diameter, connected tothe square by a causeway 10 meters wide, lies 150 meters to the northwest.30[part0050.html#note606]Image Missing [../images/00057.jpeg]Fazenda Atlantica. MAP AND PHOTO: SANNA SAUNALUOMA.Defined by the avenue connecting the square and the circle, it is clear that theprimary axis of Fazenda Atlantica runs northwest to southeast—an orientationthat makes it a candidate for alignment to the setting sun on the June solsticeand the rising sun on the December solstice. The reader will recall that SerpentMound in Ohio is also aligned northwest to southeast to both these events. Itsprincipal focus, signaled by its open jaws, is on the June solstice–midsummer inthe Northern Hemisphere, where the Serpent is located, and midwinter in theSouthern Hemisphere, where the Amazonian geoglyphs are located. Without anarchaeoastronomical survey, however, it is impossible to say whether or not thegeneral northwest to southeast alignment of Fazenda Atlantica is solstitial,and—if it is—whether any aspect of the site indicates priority given to onesolstice over the other.A similar northwest to southeast orientation is seen at Tequinho, another of thegreat Amazonian geoglyphs. When all its ancillary works were intact it extendedover an area of 15 hectares (37 acres). What remains today are its two principalsquares, the larger measuring 210-by-210 meters (with two further squaresinscribed within it) and the smaller, which has suffered extensive damage,measuring 130-by-130 meters and enclosing one further square. Defining theruling northwest axis of the site, the main entrance to the larger square is 40meters wide and opens onto a causeway 1.5 kilometers long.31[part0050.html#note607]A proper survey will be required to establish whether ornot there is any archaeoastronomical significance to the northwest orientationof Tequinho’s main entrance and causeway.Image Missing [../images/00058.jpeg]Tequinho.

ORIENTATION ARROWS ADDED.Image Missing [../images/00060.jpeg]Coquerial: The surviving ten mounds form the remains of an oval with its longaxis oriented to the northwest. MAP AND PHOTO: SANNA SAUNALUOMA. ORIENTATIONARROWS ADDED.What is already certain, however, is that a number of other Amazonian geoglyphsshare the same general alignment. An example is Fazenda Iquiri II, whichcombines a square earthwork measuring 140 meters along each side with an ovalearthwork formed by 25 adjoining mounds. The long axis of this oval, parallelingthe axis of the square, extends for 180 meters and is oriented to thenorthwest,32 [part0050.html#note608] making this site, too, a candidate forpossible solstitial alignment if and when an archaeoastronomical survey iscarried out.Another candidate is the partially destroyed site of Coqueiral, which alsoconsists of a series of adjoining mounds, of which ten survive out of anoriginal total of eighteen. The remaining mounds form a partial oval with itslong axis extending to approximately 100 meters oriented to the northwest.33[part0050.html#note609] As with Tequinho, as with Fazenda Iquiri II, and as withFazenda Atlantica, a proper survey will be required before any possiblearchaeoastronomical significance of the Coqueiral oval can be investigated.Indeed, as I review the otherwise excellent science so far dedicated to theAmazonian earthworks, it is evident that the most serious and consequentiallapse—which must be remedied if further progress is to be made—concerns thisconsistent blindness to possible archaeoastronomical connections. Not a singleone of the many papers on the geoglyphs reviewed in this chapter has a word tosay about astronomical alignments and, so far as I am aware at the time ofwriting, not one of the leading scholars has shown any interest in investigatingthe possibility that such alignments might exist. Ironically, however, the samescholars all agree:The geometric earthworks were constructed on carefully selected, elevated yetlevel surfaces. Their location on intefluvial plateaux provided good visiblecontrol over the surrounding terrain. … The carefully planned position of theearthworks in the landscape and the recurring geometric forms represented inearthwork architecture suggest functions that were part of a tradition of sharedcollective ideology related to the cosmology and/or socio-political concerns ofthe ancient peoples.The irony is that there’s an important clue here, hidden in plain sight. It’strue that the choice of “elevated locations” giving “good visible control overthe surrounding terrain” could have something to do with “the socio-politicalconcerns of the ancient peoples.” But because they offer an unobstructed view ofthe horizon, such locations are also very often what ancient astronomers lookedfor when they set out monuments on the ground—aligned, say, to the June solsticesunset or to the March equinox sunrise.Perhaps it’s partly in recognition of this that the passage cited above includesa token reference to “cosmology.”But token references are not enough.Without a full-scale archaeoastronomical survey of the Amazonian geoglyphs weare, in my opinion, unlikely ever to get to grips with the full range ofchallenges—and opportunities—that they represent.AN EVER-RECEDING HORIZONHOW OLD ARE THE GEOGLYPHS?In 2009 only a single carbon date had been established for the entire areasurveyed, then “250 km across” and constituting “200 known sites with over 210geometric structures.”34 [part0050.html#note610] The date was from FazendaColorada and proved to be quite recent—around 750 years before the present butwith a margin of error that the investigators chose to average at AD 1283,35[part0050.html#note611] a date they believed to be “representative of a numberof sites” since Fazenda Colorada “exhibits much of the variability seen for theregion.”36 [part0050.html#note612] This date, they declare, “implies a lateoccupation … only around 300 years before the Europeans’ arrival, but isconsistent with the development of complex societies in other areas of theAmazon between A.D. 900 and 1400.”37 [part0050.html#note613]As we’ve seen so often with archaeology, new discoveries can change everything,and after just three more seasons of excavation, Ranzi, Schaan, and Pärssinenwere singing a very different song. In a follow-up paper to their 2009 study,published in the Journal of Field Archaeology in 2012, they reported a greatlyexpanded survey area, now encompassing roughly 25,000 square kilometers.38[part0050.html#note614] Within it, 281 enclosures “formed by continuous ditches,in most cases surrounding a perfectly geometric inner plaza with an area of 1 to3 ha” had been found “in various shapes,” chiefly “circles, ellipses, rectanglesand squares.”39 [part0050.html#note615]Then came the first dynamite revelation. Fazenda Colorada had been thoroughlyre-excavated and five additional radiocarbon samples, collected from differentstratigraphic levels, were analyzed. Again, there are margins of error with C-14dating, but the bottom line is that the previous date of AD 1283, while fittingwith preconceptions about when and where complex societies developed in theAmazon, was found to have been taken from organic materials deposited very latein the life of the site. What the new samples indicated was that FazendaColorada had been “consistently occupied” from as early as AD 25 until aroundthe end of the fourteenth century.40 [part0050.html#note616]Organic materials from a number of other geoglyph sites were also excavated anddated, showing a similar profile, and the overall conclusion of theinvestigators across all the sites was that these “new radiocarbon dates placethe initial stage of earthwork construction as early as 2000 BP.”41[part0050.html#note617]In summary, therefore, just 3 years of research between 2009 and 2012 witnesseda profound change in archaeological understanding of the geoglyphs of thesouthwestern Amazon. Previously they’d been thought to be just 750 years old;now, without any real attention being drawn to the implications, they’d become2,000 years old. To put this in context, an error and subsequent correction on asimilar scale would certainly attract a great deal of attention if it concernedWestern architecture—indeed it would be like discovering that the great Gothiccathedrals of Europe such as Chartres and York Minster were not, in fact, worksof the late medieval period but had actually been built by the Romans.What are we to conclude concerning mistakes of such magnitude, and the tendencyof archaeologists to reach and propagate premature conclusions based on limitedsamples? For instance, the single AD 1283 date from Fazenda Colorada beingallowed to stand for 3 years without corroboration as “representative of anumber of sites”? And similarly at Serpent Mound in Ohio, where in 2018 a dateof around AD 1000 was still being touted in official notices despite firm C-14evidence, on the public record since 2014, that the structure is more than 1,000years older than that?42 [part0050.html#note618] Readers will make up their ownminds, but the uncertainty and the constant failure of old models (such asClovis First in North America and Meggers’s “counterfeit paradise” dogma aboutthe Amazon) do not fill me with confidence about much else that this disciplinehas to say.In particular, I am not persuaded by the new consensus that the geoglyphs of thesouthwestern Amazon are 2,000 years old. Other C-14 dates mentioned in the 2012report already hint at a more complicated picture.Take the site known as Severino Calazans, for example. Curiously, the squaregeoglyph the archaeologists excavated here has the same massive“footprint”—measuring 230 meters along each side43 [part0050.html#note619]—asthe Great Pyramid of Egypt.44 [part0050.html#note620] Both monuments are alsocardinally oriented—that is, their sides face the cardinal directions, north,south, east, and west.45 [part0050.html#note621]Two C-14 dates for Severino Calazans were cited by Ranzi, Schaan, and Pärssinenas further confirmation that the Amazonian geoglyph project began “about 2000years ago.”46 [part0050.html#note622] Margins of error apply, but these dateswere 159 BC (from excavation Unit 3) and 171 BC (from Unit 6B).47[part0050.html#note623] Fitting much less comfortably into the new hypothesis,however, were the two other dates from Severino Calazans. Again, there aremargins of error, but these dates were, respectively, 1211 BC (from Unit 5) and2577 BC (from Unit 3)48 [part0050.html#note624]—the latter suggesting that thisgeoglyph might not only have the same footprint as the Great Pyramid of Egyptbut might also be about the same age.We’ve seen how the existence of true civilizations in the Amazon before Europeancontact has been cautiously embraced by archaeologists in recent years. Even so,few would yet be willing to accept that any Amazonian “civilization” worthy ofthe name might have existed as early as 2577 BC and certainly not onewell-organized and motivated enough to create a cardinally oriented geoglyph onthe grand scale of Severino Calazans, where the full perimeter, defined by anenclosure ditch 12 meters wide, measures 920 meters—more than 3,000 feet.49[part0050.html#note625]Unsurprisingly, therefore, Ranzi, Schaan, and Pärssinen conclude that the dateof 2577 BC “is probably unrelated to the time of initial construction of theearthworks.”50 [part0050.html#note626]All they’re prepared to concede is that “this date suggests early human activityat the site.”51 [part0050.html#note627] They perhaps stick their necks outfurther than most of their peers would when they allow the possibility that thesecond anomalous date from Severino Calazans—1211 BC—“may be related toearthwork construction.”52 [part0050.html#note628]But what is the logic of this? If we have dispensed with our former assertionthat a date of AD 1283 was “somehow representative” of the geoglyphs in general,and if we are going to allow a possible start on this great regional project asearly as 1211 BC, then why should we be unable to contemplate an even earlierstart as far back as 2577 BC? Since so little of the Amazon has been surveyed byarchaeologists, and since no theory about the character and constraints of itspast cultures and civilizations has been able to explain all the data, it wouldsurely be wiser to keep an open mind.Besides, as Ranzi, Pärssinen, and Schaan themselves point out, they are workingwith a very limited sample of the potential data. Pärssinen at one pointestimated that as many as 1,500 geoglyphs might ultimately be found,53[part0050.html#note629] and the authorities are in general agreement that “theseearthworks, uncovered by modern deforestation … represent only a fraction of thetotal, which lie undiscovered beneath the intact seasonal southern Amazonianrainforests.”54 [part0050.html#note630]It is therefore perfectly possible that multiple other sites, as yet unknown toarchaeologists, will be discovered in the years to come. They might confirm theexisting archaeological model that the geoglyphs are about 2,000 years old, orthey might turn out to reinforce that anomalous date of 2577 BC—or, who knows,they might even provide much older dates and reveal more sophisticatedconstructions.Once again, whatever the facts are on the ground, we won’t know for sure unlesswe look.CURIOSITIESIT’S A CURIOSITY—I CLAIM nothing more at this point—that the square enclosureditch at Severino Calazans shares the ground plan, base dimensions, andcardinality of the Great Pyramid of Egypt, as well as a carbon date from theepoch of the Great Pyramid.55 [part0050.html#note631] That epoch, moreover,around 2500 BC, coincides and overlaps with the megalithic epoch in Europe, soanother curiosity is the way that the circular geoglyphs of Amazonia resemble“henges”—the circular embankments with deep internal ditches that surround thegreat stone circles of the British Isles. The scale is very similar and theresemblance is so obvious that even the most sober archaeologists, usually waryof cross-cultural comparisons, are willing to remark upon it. For example, Dr.Jennifer Watling of the Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography at the Universityof São Paulo, author of an important study of the Amazonian earthworks publishedin the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in February 2017, statesfrankly that the characteristics of the circular geoglyphs with theirembankments and ditches “are what classically describe henge sites. The earliestphases at Stonehenge consisted of a similarly laid out enclosure. … It is likelythat the geoglyphs were used for similar functions to the Neolithic causewayedenclosures, i.e. public gathering, ritual sites.”56 [part0050.html#note632]A point of order here. A “henge” is a prehistoric earthwork formed by a circularembankment surrounding a ditch. Usually the embankment is heaped up from thesoil removed to create the ditch. This is the case, for example, at thecausewayed enclosure of Avebury, Europe’s largest henge, which has a diameter ofapproximately 420 meters.57 [part0050.html#note633] Walking briskly it takesabout half an hour to make a complete circuit of the lip of the Aveburyembankment from which you look down, across the ditch, at the immense circularinner plaza that the ditch defines. Disposed at intervals around the outerperimeter of this plaza, set back a couple of meters from its edge, a completering of giant megaliths once stood in antiquity, encompassing two other stonecircles placed side by side. Very few of the original megaliths now remain—thesite having been used as a quarry in later times—but, although Avebury’scauseways are almost entirely gone, the henge is still there and it is stillpossible to make out the form of the great stone circle that it encloses and theremnants of the paired inner circles. What cannot now be seen, but wasdiscovered in 2017 by archaeologists using ground-penetrating radar, is thesquare formation, measuring 30 meters along each side, again defined by aperimeter of standing stones, that once occupied the center of the southernmostof the two inner circles.58 [part0050.html#note634]Image Missing [../images/00061.jpeg]An impression by the antiquarian William Stukeley (early eighteenth century) ofthe complete Avebury complex as it would originally have appeared in itslandscape.

PHOTO: RICARDO AZOURY/PULSARIMAGENS.Strangely enough, at a site called Jacó Sá in the Amazon we also find a geoglyphin which circle and square are combined, but here it is the square that enclosesthe circle: “The square sides,” report Ranzi, Schaan, and their colleagues, “are140 m long, while the external embankment is 12 m wide and 1.6 m high. Thecircle contains an internal embankment, and is 100 m in diameter.”59[part0050.html#note635]This mention of embankments raises a more general point. Though Avebury is atrue henge, Stonehenge—despite its name—technically is not. This is because itsoriginal great circular ditch was cut outside, not inside, its embankment.60[part0050.html#note636] As Jennifer Watling remarks, it’s interesting to notethat some of the Amazonian geoglyphs have this same format “with an outerditch.”61 [part0050.html#note637] Some, like Jacó Sá, have both. As with theBritish henges, however, so with the Amazon. Ranzi, Schaan, and Pärssinenconfirm that “the ditches” of the Amazonian geoglyphs “are usually situatedinside the embankments.”62 [part0050.html#note638]A GLOBAL LEGACY?JENNIFER WATLING’S PAPER, COAUTHORED WITH Denise Schaan, Alceu Ranzi, andothers, describes circular geoglyphs of the Amazon “with ditches up to 11 mwide, 4 m deep, and 100–300 m in diameter.”63 [part0050.html#note639] Theauthors argue that these sites, “some of which have up to six enclosures … rivalthe most impressive examples of pre-Columbian monumental architecture anywherein the Americas.” Their excavations found “an almost complete absence ofcultural material … within the enclosed areas.” They conclude that theearthworks “were built and used sporadically as ceremonial and public gatheringsites between 2000 and 650 calibrated years before present, but that some mayhave been constructed as early as 3500–3000 BP.”64 [part0050.html#note640]I’ve put the early dates in bold for two reasons.First, because they are given in the paper at all. What we have here is a groupof mainstream archaeologists sticking their necks out a little bit further inthe pages of a prestigious journal on what, until now, would have been thoughtof as an impossible achievement for Amazonian societies 3,500 years ago.Second, these same archaeologists are still being cautious. The period of3500–3000 BP that they’re prepared to entertain for the construction of at least“some” of the geoglyphs corresponds with Unit 5 at Severino Calazans, where asample yielded a date, within the usual margins of error, of 1211 BC.65[part0050.html#note641]The paper makes no mention, however, of the other much earlier date of 2577 BCthat was retrieved from Unit 366 [part0050.html#note642]—the date that coincideswith the epoch of Stonehenge, Avebury, and the Great Pyramid of Egypt.Before I go further let me reiterate a key point about which it is important tobe absolutely clear. It is NOT my purpose here to insinuate that the Amazoniangeoglyphs were in any way inspired by Britain’s stone circles, or by the GreatPyramid of Egypt or by other known Old World monuments—or, for that matter, viceversa. Where there are similarities, my suggestion is that it might be morefruitful to look for their origins in a remote ancestral civilization thatpassed down a common inheritance all around the globe—an inheritance ofknowledge, an inheritance of science, an inheritance of “earth-measuring” thatwas then put into practice in many different environments by the many differentcultures receiving it.In some, the inheritance may have been rejected at the outset, or subsequentlyfrittered away and lost. In others, as millennia passed, locally originateddifferences in expression multiplied to such an extent that they often almostcompletely obscured the underlying genetic connections to a remote commonancestor.Nonetheless, dig deep enough and those connections—like recessive genes—sooneror later make themselves felt.Not all the henges of the British Isles contain stone circles; many are simplygigantic earthworks like the geoglyphs of the southwestern Amazon. No megalithicmonuments have yet been found in the Brazilian state of Acre where the geoglyphsproliferate—perhaps because of a lack of good natural materials, or perhapsbecause so much of the area has yet to be properly surveyed.There are stone circles in the Amazon, however, as we shall see in the nextchapter."},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00064.jpeg]THE AMAZON’S OWN STONEHENGETHE FIRST FOREIGN VISITOR TO mention the existence of megalithic circles in theAmazon was the Swiss zoologist Emílio Goeldi, who traveled up the Cunani Riverinto what is now the northern part of the Brazilian state of Amapá, near itsborder with French Guiana, in the late nineteenth century.1[part0050.html#note643] He makes no mention, however, of formations of hugegranite blocks, obviously worked upon and moved into place by human beings,overlooking a stream called the Rego Grande.In the 1920s Curt Nimuendajú, a German-Brazilian ethnologist, also visitedmegaliths in the region, but he likewise appears to have been unaware of thespectacular formations of Rego Grande. They were seen, however, and noted byBetty Meggers and her colleague Clifford Evans of the Smithsonian Institution inthe 1950s2 [part0050.html#note644] and now, at last, with the Smithsonian’sresources, came the opportunity for a thorough investigation of the mysterioussite. Predictably, what we might call “the curse of Meggers” descended upon theRego Grande stone circles. These great formations of megaliths shouldn’t haveexisted at all, according to her prejudices about the ancient Amazon, and werethus deemed unworthy of further excavation.3 [part0050.html#note645]Thereafter, lacking the Smithsonian’s seal of approval, the interesting problemof Rego Grande was quietly set aside and ignored by archaeology for the next 40years while the site itself fell back into its former state of absoluteobscurity and was in due course forgotten.But climates of opinion in scholarship from time to time undergo radical shifts,and forgotten things sometimes cry out to be remembered. Thus, just as thegeoglyphs of Acre were first identified back in the 1970s in an area whereswaths of formerly dense rainforest were being cleared for use by the cattleindustry, so it was with the Rego Grande stone circles. They were rediscoveredin the 1990s by ranch foreman Lailson Camelo da Silva, who was clearing land forpasture. “I had no idea that I was discovering the Amazon’s own Stonehenge,” helater told a reporter. “It makes me wonder. What other secrets about our pastare still hidden in Brazil’s jungles?”4 [part0050.html#note646]The publicity around Silva’s “discovery,” coupled with new insights into thecomplexity of ancient Amazonian civilization, led to a gradual reawakening ofinterest in Rego Grande. More research was done and out of roughly 200prehistoric sites identified across the state of Amapá it was found that 30 hadmegalithic monuments of one kind or another.5 [part0050.html#note647]In 2005 archaeologists Mariana Petry Cabral and João Darcy de Moura Saldanha ofAmapá’s Institute of Scientific and Technological Research set about the task ofsurveying them all, with a particular focus on Rego Grande. There, the principalstone circle, which has a diameter of 30 meters, consists of 127 uprightmegaliths. Brought from a quarry 3 kilometers away, the megaliths weigh up to 4tons each and stand between 2.5 meters (just over 8 feet) and 4 meters (justover 13 feet) tall.6 [part0050.html#note648] Areas within the circle were usedfor elaborate human burials involving funerary urns and vases in a known potterystyle of the region.By 2011 a preliminary age of about 1,000 years was being suggested for the site.This was based, according to Mariana Cabral, on “three date checks on fragmentsof charcoal” found among pottery in the burial area.7 [part0050.html#note649]Ten other prehistoric sites in the state of Amapá, three of them with megaliths,were also dated in the same way and “all seem to have been occupied betweenseven hundred and a thousand years ago.”8 [part0050.html#note650]Much more work will have to be done before we can be sure that these dates willnot be revised—like the ages of the geoglyphs—in the light of new evidence. Mostimportant, meticulous care will have to be taken to be certain that the stonecircle, on the one hand, and the burials from which the C-14 dates were derived,on the other, are works of the same period. The phenomenon of “intrusiveburials” is one that archaeologists commonly encounter; particularly where anancient, sacred site is involved there is a tendency for later people to want tobury and sanctify their dead there (such anachronistic burials have been found,for example, at the Sphinx and at the Third Pyramid at Giza). The danger,therefore, is that an older site will be given a falsely young date based onmaterials from the intrusive burial.Indeed, Cabral and Saldanha note that pottery of the same style and type as thepieces at Rego Grande from which the samples of charcoal were taken is commonalong “all of the northern coast of Amapá and in French Guiana” and has alsobeen “regularly found in prehistoric sites that have no stone monuments.”9[part0050.html#note651]I’m therefore not convinced by the association of this pottery andcarbon-datable charcoal with the original construction date of the stone circleat Rego Grande. That being said, however, it makes no difference to me if itdoes turn out to be of the same age as the burials. My argument is not thatevery mysterious monument now emerging from the depths of the Amazon must dateback to the Pleistocene. I’m concerned here, rather, with the manifestation of alegacy of ideas that may be of Ice Age antiquity—ideas involving geometry andideas also very much involving astronomy. It’s the ideas that matter, whether weencounter them in the Amazon, or at Serpent Mound in Ohio, or at Angkor inCambodia, or at Stonehenge in the British Isles, or among the monuments ofEgypt’s Giza plateau. If mechanisms to carry, preserve, and transmit them downthe generations have been introgressed into the local cultural DNA, then I seeno reason why they should not manifest, and reveal their fundamentalsimilarities, wherever and whenever conducive circumstances arise.It therefore has to be of interest, whatever the age of the great stone circleat Rego Grande ultimately proves to be, that it appears to share a key “meme”with Stonehenge and with Serpent Mound.Image Missing [../images/00065.jpeg]The primary alignment of Serpent Mound is to the summer solstice sunset. But inthe reverse direction the same alignment targets—and in a convolution of theSerpent’s body recognizes—the winter solstice sunrise. Two other convolutionstarget, respectively, the equinox sunrise and the summer solstice sunrise.Coined by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene,10[part0050.html#note652] the word “meme” refers to “An element of a culture orsystem of behavior passed from one individual to another by imitation or othernon-genetic means.”11 [part0050.html#note653]In the case of Stonehenge, Serpent Mound, and Rego Grande, the meme concerns theorientation of the sites—which in all three cases honors the sun on the June andDecember solstices. We reviewed these alignments for Stonehenge and SerpentMound in part 1, and the reader will recall that they are reversible—that is, analignment to the summer solstice sunrise is also, in the reverse direction, analignment to the winter solstice sunset, while an alignment to the wintersolstice sunrise is also, in the reverse direction, an alignment to the summersolstice sunset.In the case of Rego Grande, it is the winter solstice that is the primary focus.Cabral and Saldanha point to a megalith that uses shadow effects to track “thesun’s path throughout this day.”12 [part0050.html#note654] Two other granitemegaliths close by, one with an artificial hole cut through it, also line up totrack the rising point of the winter solstice sun.13 [part0050.html#note655]Image Missing [../images/00066.jpeg]The Rego Grande Stone Circle. PHOTO: MARIANA CABRAL. Stone 3 tracks the path ofthe sun throughout the day on the winter solstice. Stones 1 and 2 (the formerwith a sighting hole cut through it—see inset) line up to target the wintersolstice sunrise.The strong foundations of the site make it unlikely that the megaliths wouldhave shifted position. Even blocks lying horizontally, it turns out, have notfallen but were purposefully placed:Those lying on the ground never stood upright. Instead, the layer of laterite[beneath them] was carefully dug so that they fit snugly with the ground.Excavations carried out … around the bottom of the standing stones also revealedsmall blocks of granite and laterite which were used to wedge the monoliths atthis unusual angle.14 [part0050.html#note656]Cabral and Saldanha’s conclusion is that all the angles were “carefullyconsidered by those who conceived them.”15 [part0050.html#note657]Archaeologist Manoel Calado of the University of Lisbon, an expert on Portuguesemegaliths, agrees. “I’m sure,” he said after a visit to Rego Grande. “This isone of the aspects that makes the Amazon megaliths very similar to those inEurope.”16 [part0050.html#note658]Richard Callahan, professor of archaeology at the University of Calgary, is alsoon Cabral and Saldanha’s side:Given that astronomical objects, stars, constellations, etc., have a majorimportance in much of Amazonian mythology and cosmology, it does not in any waysurprise me that such an observatory exists.17 [part0050.html#note659]For Eduardo Neves, too, “the idea of the place being a sort of observatory is agood one,” although he adds, quite rightly, that “we still need to test it.”18[part0050.html#note660]PAINEL DO PILÃOONLY THE MOST RUDIMENTARY SURVEY has been undertaken at Rego Grande, enough toreveal the major solstitial focus of the great stone circle, but nothing more.Other, much richer information may or may not be concealed within the multiplealignments of the megaliths, as is the case at Stonehenge and Serpent Mound, buta major archaeoastronomical study will be required to settle the matter. AsJarita Holbrook, associate professor of physics at South Africa’s University ofthe Western Cape, comments: “It takes more than a circle of standing stones toget a Stonehenge.”19 [part0050.html#note661]I would add, however, that a circle of standing stones with a solstitialalignment is a pretty good start!Moreover, and I suggest of great relevance given the uncertainty over the datesof Rego Grande, a major archaeoastronomical study has already been undertaken atanother Amazonian site approximately 550 kilometers to the southwest. NamedPainel do Pilão, it is located just 400 meters from Pedra Pintada, the paintedrock shelter investigated in 1996 by Anna Roosevelt. We saw in chapter 12 howshe and her team excavated multiple occupation layers within the shelter, theoldest and deepest of which turned out to be perhaps as old as 16,000 years(according to thermoluminescence dating) and 14,200 years (according toradiocarbon dating).20 [part0050.html#note662]There has been no serious challenge to these dates but, following further workby Roosevelt, Pedra Pintada’s rock art is now usually reported, reflecting thecurrent cautious consensus of the archaeological community, to date between13,630 and 11,705 years ago.21 [part0050.html#note663]Image Missing [../images/00067.jpeg]Dates for the art at the nearby Painel do Pilão rock shelter, excavated byChristopher Sean Davis of Northern Illinois University, are closely similar,being variously given in his 2016 report at between 13,014 and 12,725 years ago,and between 13,135 and 12,810 years ago.22 [part0050.html#note664] All togethera total of four samples from two adjacent excavation levels were subjected toC-14 testing. All were found, says Davis, “to be consistent and contemporary toRoosevelt’s paleoindian dates from Caverna da Pedra Pintada.”23[part0050.html#note665] His conclusion, therefore, is that the initial artworksof Painel do Pilão were created at “around the time that the area was firstinhabited 13,000 years ago, and that those earliest images, which were probablyretouched or traced more recently, were positioned in the most prominent walllocations and height.”24 [part0050.html#note666]Davis suggests that the rock wall itself, as well as the floor at its base, weredeliberately leveled by the ancients to form a 90-degree angle to one another.The whole ensemble, he says, was “made straight and flat throughout” toconfigure a “platform stage from which an observer can view the rock art from aspecific location.”25 [part0050.html#note667]Once standing in that location, Davis further notes, “the painting most centralto the observer’s field of view is a grid image that has individual boxes markedwith mostly repetitive (but some varying) tallies.”26 [part0050.html#note668]Image Missing [../images/00068.jpeg]Painel do Pilão “calendar.” PHOTO: CHRISTOPHER SEAN DAVIS.It looks like a calendar—and indeed, some years before Davis, Roosevelt was thefirst scholar to consider that possibility.27 [part0050.html#note669] Whilerecognizing that “alternative theories not related to astronomy cannot be ruledout,” Davis reinvestigated the matter over the course of a solar year andnoticed a possible pattern to do with[t]he intersection of the setting sun to a rocky perch in the near distanceabove and to the right of the painted outcrop.The annual movement of the sun relative to the rocky perch allows for theintersection of the setting sun through the center of the perch approximately18–20 days before and after the winter solstice (which currently occurs onDecember 21). … If each box of the painted grid image represents one day ofobserving the setting of the sun relative to the rocky perch, 49 days after theday of the winter solstice, the sun sets too far to the north of the rockyperch, entirely missing the structure. The grid painting has 49 total boxes andthe center boxes have tally marks that are simply vertical lines. Most othertally marks are crisscrosses. The rocky perch and the grid image might,therefore, have been a way for paleoindians to foretell the winter solstice andthe passage of a new year.28 [part0050.html#note670]Image Missing [../images/00069.jpeg]Painel do Pilão painted outcrop with its rock art surface in the center-to-leftforeground, and a rocky outcrop with a window-like feature at a distance in thetop right background of the photo. The sun intersects this “window” in the earlyafternoon 18 to 20 days before and after the winter solstice. PHOTO: CHRISTOPHERSEAN DAVIS. ANNOTATION ADDED.What adds to the likelihood that Davis is correct is that he and his team foundother alignments at Painel do Pilão. For example, just as the orientation ofwhat they call the “platform stage” suggests an ancient focus on the Decembersolstice sunset, so, too, another prominent cluster of images aligns to therising point of the sun on the June solstice.29 [part0050.html#note671]Meanwhile:A third astronomy alignment occurs with a single red pictograph discovered abovethe excavation unit on a vertical ledge on the underside of the painted outcrop.The ledge may have been intentionally altered, but further investigation isneeded for certainty. The painted circle itself faces 270° [the azimuth ofsunset on the equinox], but the shelter walls block all views of the westernhorizon or sky from this location. However, just beneath the circle and ledge isan opening that allows one to see through to the other side of the outcrop andthe horizon beyond. This vantage point beneath the painted circle aligns to~90°, the position of the rising sun on the equinox, which occurs on March 20and September 23 currently.30 [part0050.html#note672]At the very least, says Davis, the rock art and alignments at Painel do Pilãotell us that cultures in the heart of the Amazon 13,000 years ago “engaged andutilized sophisticated knowledge of astronomy maintained through rock art andpossibly shared or reimagined by more recent cultures who either inherited orrediscovered the ancient paintings.”31 [part0050.html#note673]He’s right to draw attention to the legacy aspect of all this—the possibility,long after the original painters and horizon astronomers of Painel do Pilão weregone, that later cultures might have inherited and reimagined the ancient ideasand obsessions manifested there. This is how we would expect carefully craftedand cleverly designed memes to propagate themselves down the ages, and itappears to echo exactly the process at Serpent Mound, which was likewisemaintained, renovated, and reimagined by successive cultures down the ages andwhich likewise signals the solstices and the equinoxes.Painel do Pilão is important because it tells us that the “meme” of sacredstructures aligned to the solstices and equinoxes, found in monumental art andarchitecture all around the world, has been present in the Amazon for at least13,000-years and perhaps—we must await future discoveries in the unexploredreaches of the jungle—for far longer than that.It also has wider implications. If people were capable of carefully marking,recording, and honoring these celestial events in South America 13,000 yearsago, then there is no good reason to suppose they should not have done so inNorth America as well—and therefore no good reason to dismiss the possibilitythat Serpent Mound’s original alignments also go back to that distant epoch.Archaeology says a firm NO to this, accompanied by guffaws of derision.As we’ve seen, however, the archaeology of Serpent Mound is riddled withcontradictions and uncertainties and appears to have produced dates markingvarious episodes of restoration and renovation rather than convincing evidenceof when the monument was originally designed and founded.HYPOTHESISIN HIS REPORT CHRISTOPHER DAVIS mentions Rego Grande, “presumed to be morerecent” than Painel do Pilão, as another Amazonian site at whicharchaeoastronomical alignments have been investigated.32 [part0050.html#note674]He draws no specific connection beyond that, but in my view the confirmation ofa solstitial focus at both, as also at Serpent Mound in Ohio, and Stonehenge andother megalithic sites worldwide, is noteworthy.Moreover, although there is no henge at Rego Grande, we’ve seen that thesolstitially aligned stone circle there shares the Amazon basin with hugenumbers of hengelike earthworks. We’ve noted how these, too, have never beensubject to any kind of rigorous archaeoastronomical investigation. Meanwhile,the total number of geometric ditched enclosures discovered in the southwesternAmazon survey area had increased from “over 210,” the figure on record in 2009,to “over 450” by 2017.33 [part0050.html#note675]Then in 2018 a further study by Denise Schaan and colleagues reported anextension of the survey area across much of the southern rim of the Amazonbasin:The results show that an 1800 km stretch of southern Amazonia was occupied byearth-building cultures.34 [part0050.html#note676]In one area alone, the Upper Tapajos Basin, 81 previously unknown pre-Columbiansites were discovered, with a total of 104 earthworks.35 [part0050.html#note677]Among them were many complex enclosures including one, 390 meters in diameter,featuring 11 mounds circularly arranged at the center of the enclosure.36[part0050.html#note678]The researchers suggest that at least 1,300 further sites remain hidden withinthe jungles of the Amazon’s southern rim—a number, they add, that is “likely tobe an underestimation”37 [part0050.html#note679] while “huge swaths of therainforest are still unexplored.”38 [part0050.html#note680] They remind us thatthe terre firme forests “that account for ~95% of the Amazon are particularlyuncharted” because “these areas have been archaeologically neglected followingtraditional views that pre-Columbian people concentrated on resource-richfloodplains. However, the discovery of large pre-Columbian earthworks in terrafirme along the Southern Rim of the Amazon undermines the assumption that theseareas were marginal in terms of past human impact and the development of complexsocieties.”39 [part0050.html#note681]It is undoubtedly the case that many more structures remain to be found thanhave already presented themselves to science. Our entire understanding of thisvast region is being transformed by new discoveries and, indeed, as we’ve seen,the notion of complex societies in the pre-Columbian Amazon is no longeranathema to archaeologists, some of whom now even dare to describe thosesocieties as “civilizations.”Given that such civilizations existed in ancient Amazonia, and clearly had thecapacity to manifest their ideas in great public projects, it is intriguing thatthe end result was the vigorous, flamboyant, and extensive expression of thevery same architectural, astronomical, and geometrical “memes” that characterizesacred architecture in many other parts of the world, and at many differentperiods.An analogy between genetics and culture—genes and memes—can serve us well here.Let’s say, purely hypothetically of course, that a system of ideas istransferred, by direct teachings, from one culture to another. The recipientsociety as a whole, however, may not yet be ready to put the teachings intopractice. What is required, then, is that some sort of institution be set upthat can recruit the brightest and the best from the local population. They, inturn, will draft new talent with each new generation, initiating them andtraining them in the essential details of the system—which will assume thecharacter of a religion and will in due course integrate itself deeply intoevery level, even into the habits of thought, of the recipient culture.Eventually, when the right time for the next stage of the project is judged tohave arrived—perhaps very soon, perhaps after thousands of years, depending onlocal circumstances—the religious leaders will mobilize the population to enactthe great projects of sacred geometry that had for so long remained encoded, butunexpressed, within their cultural DNA.40 [part0050.html#note682]It is, I emphasize, only a hypothesis. In this context, though, it’sthought-provoking to consider an ethnographic report from 1887 written by acertain Colonel Antonio R. P. Labre after he had ascended the Madeira, the Beni,and the Madre de Dios Rivers and then crossed overland to the Acre River. Hisjourney took him right through the heart of the geoglyph territory of Acre andinvolved numerous encounters with its inhabitants, the Araona people—who had, bythat time, been reduced to a tiny remnant after hundreds of years of devastatingepidemics, slave raids, and murderous attacks by commercial rubber tappersseeking to drive them off their land. “It was not uncommon,” writes DeniseSchaan, “for rubber tappers to capture native women for wives. The encroachingwhites would frequently promote raids to enslave the native population for therubber industry, a situation that 40 years later would result in thenear-extinction of tens of thousands of natives.”41 [part0050.html#note683]Since all work on the geoglyphs had ceased hundreds of years previously, we canonly guess how much of the past of their once great culture these harried,encroached-upon, and deeply endangered Aroanas remembered by the time of Labre’svisit. We cannot even be sure that they were the direct descendants of thegeoglyph builders (rather than of more recent migrants to the area).Nonetheless, what Labre tells us feels significant. He didn’t see the geoglyphs,which were then entirely overgrown by jungle, but he was in the midst of them onAugust 17, 1887, when he stayed overnight at an Aroana village calledMamuceyada. He describes there being, as well as plantations, “about 200inhabitants … a form of government, temples and a form of worship”—from which,together with “knowing the name of the idols,” women were excluded. Ofparticular importance and relevance here is Labre’s report:The idols are not of human form, but are geometrical figures made of wood andpolished. The father of the gods is called Epymara, his image has an ellipticalform, and is about 16 inches high. … Although they have “medicine-men” chargedwith religious duties and remaining celibates, the chief is neverthelesspontifex of the church.42 [part0050.html#note684]Consider the improbability of this if it does not arise from some real thoughforgotten connection. Here in a landscape mysteriously inscribed in antiquitywith vast geometrical earthworks, at a time when the earthworks themselves hadlong since been swallowed by jungle, we find a Native American tribe whose godstake the form of polished wooden “geometrical figures.” The tribal chief is thereligious leader but there are also “medicine-men” who likewise have religiousduties.It already sounds exactly like the sort of institution for the replication andtransmission of geometric memes that I proposed as a hypothesis earlier, but itgets even more interesting when the shamans involved, and often the population,are drinking ayahuasca."},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00070.jpeg]THE VINE OF THE DEADWHAT ARE THE AMAZONIAN GEOGLYPHS? Why did the ancients go to such trouble tomake these colossal earthworks? Why is geometry their most obvious theme? And towhat extent, if any, since stone circles are frequently associated with similarearthworks elsewhere, does the presence of stone circles in the Amazon help usto understand the geoglyphs?So far we have considered only geometry and certain cosmic alignments, but myhypothesis in both cases, and in the case of the extraordinarily similarearthworks of the Mississippi Valley that we’ll explore in parts 5 and 6, isthat we are dealing with “memes” here. Moreover, it is a phenomenon in itselfthat the same memes appear again and again among seemingly unrelated cultures ofboth the Old World and the New World, separated sometimes not only by thousandsof miles but by thousands of years.Much more work will be required to establish when the memes of geometry andcosmic alignment first took root in the Amazon. Archaeology on its own is oflimited use to us here, since so little has been done even at the sites alreadydiscovered and since so much of the region has never been investigated at all.What would help would be a much more thorough and detailed archaeoastronomicalsurvey of Rego Grande, and of other stone circles in its vicinity, than hasalready been undertaken. In parallel, as I argued earlier, an equally thorougharchaeoastronomical survey of the Amazonian geoglyphs is a must if we are torefine not only our understanding of their geometry but also to tease out anycosmic alignments they may contain. Since no such study has yet been undertakenall we can say for sure is that some of the geoglyphs reviewed in chapter 15are, definitely, cosmically aligned.We’ve seen, for example, that both Fazenda Parana and Severino Calazans consistof square geoglyphs. The first features two squares, one 200 meters along eachside and the second exactly half that size, with an interconnecting causeway.Meanwhile, the second site has side lengths of 230 meters, giving it the samefootprint as the Great Pyramid of Egypt. All four of these squares—the two atFazenda Parana, the one at Severino Calazans, and of course the Great Pyramiditself, are cardinally oriented, that is, their sides face true north, south,east, and west. The most basic and obvious of the cosmic alignments sharedacross these sites are therefore to the celestial north and south poles (thepoints on the celestial sphere directly above the earth’s geographic north andsouth poles, around which the stars and planets appear to rotate during thecourse of the night1 [part0051.html#note685]), and to the points of sunrise andsunset on the spring and autumn equinoxes (when the sun rises perfectly due eastand sets perfectly due west).We’ve also seen that other great earthworks of the Amazon feature strongnorthwest-to-southeast orientations. This would put the investigation ofpossible solstitial alignments and also of “lunar standstill alignments” (ofwhich more in part 5) at the top of the list of priorities if any properarchao-astronomical survey should ever be undertaken.I think it likely that such a survey of the Amazonian geoglyphs, as of the stonecircles, would reveal many more (and far more intricate) cosmic alignments,perhaps even as subtle and complex as the multiple alignments found at the GreatPyramid, Stonehenge, and Serpent Mound. There’s little point in speculatingfurther on such matters when we don’t yet have the necessary data from theAmazon. For the sake of argument, however, let’s assume that the memes ofgeometry and cosmic alignment are part of a connected system there, as they arein so many other parts of the world where the required research has already beendone. In that case we can say, on the basis of the equinoctial and solstitialalignments at Painel do Pilão, the single Amazonian site where somethingapproaching a thorough archaeoastronomical study has been undertaken, that thesystem must have reached Amazonia at least 13,000 years ago. That it should thenhave later iterations in different media, such as the stone circle at RegoGrande and the great cosmically aligned geoglyphs at Severino Calazans andFazenda Parana, should not surprise us.We are dealing, I believe, with deliberately created memes here—memes that havea deeply mysterious purpose and that function in ineffable ways. They aretransmitted by repetition and replication, which explains their similarities.But cultures, once separated, tend to evolve and develop in their owndistinctive and quirky fashion. We can therefore expect that not only the mediaand materials through which the memes are made manifest, but also their localinterpretation, will vary greatly through time and between one part of the worldand another while nonetheless retaining a constant core of unvarying centralideas.WESTERN SCIENCE WADES INTHE FIRST EFFORTS OF WESTERN scientists to interpret the geoglyphs of Amazoniawere predictably utilitarian and reductionist, with attempts being made topersuade us that the great geometrical earthworks must have been built fordefensive purposes. But with no evidence of warfare around them, with theditches clearly not “moats” (since so many of them are placed within the earthenembankments rather than outside them), and with no evidence of palisade walls(for example, in the form of postholes or wooden remains), this theory soon lostfavor.2 [part0051.html#note686] Not only was there no evidence of warfare, butactually very little at all in the way of archaeological materials—pottery,figurines, refuse, et cetera—that would help to decipher the use, meaning, andpurpose of the geoglyphs. The consensus now, therefore, is that they werecreated for “ritual,” “spiritual,” “religious,” and “ceremonial” purposes.3[part0051.html#note687]William Balée, professor of anthropology at Tulane University, is a supporter ofthis new consensus, but is doing no more than stating the obvious when hesuggests that the spiritual/religious role of the Amazonian glyphs must in someway have involved “geometry and gigantism.”4 [part0051.html#note688]Well, yes, professor. Obviously! But in what way? And to what purposes?If we seek useful answers to such questions, rather than easy inferences or meredescriptions of these gigantic geometric patterns, then we are going to have todo what a very few Western scientists, to their credit, are now doing—and thatis to consult indigenous peoples still living in the Amazon today.Finnish scholars Sanna Saunaluoma and Pirjo Kristiina Virtanen have led the wayin this fresh approach. The cultural destruction of the past five centuries haswiped many of the tribal memory banks clean—the ongoing process of imposedamnesia that has left us so bereft of knowledge about the ancient Amazon. It isclear, however, that all is not yet lost.In 2013, for example, Saunaluoma and Virtanen brought a group of fiveManchineri—an indigenous tribe living today in the region of the earthworks—tovisit Jacó Sá. This immense geoglyph, depicting a circle within a square, as thereader will recall, is located about 250 kilometers from their territory. Theinvestigators report that the Manchineri “immediately reported feelingsensations of being in an ancient ritual atmosphere.” Moreover, “They said thattheir ancestors had talked about these types of places, although they could notoffer any explanation as to why the earthwork ditches were so deep or even whythey had been constructed.”5 [part0051.html#note689]A second local tribal group, the Apurinã, “narrated that their parents hadadvised them to pass by the earthworks quickly and avoid their vicinity whenpossible because they signify difference, promote avoidance, and are regarded as‘enchanted,’ or ‘miraculous’ places.”6 [part0051.html#note690]Certainly, then, at least the traces of a memory of how significant theearthworks must have been in their prime, and of the awe that they formerlyinspired, lingers on in local superstitions and folklore.But a reservoir of much more detailed information has been stored away in theAmazon and here, too, Saunaluoma and Virtanen are pioneers in finding links tothe earthworks.THE SHAMANISTIC COSMOSSOME OF THE CLUES THEY have drawn on have been available for more than 130years.They’re found in the account, given in the last chapter, of the worship of“geometrical” gods by the Aroana people in the vicinity of the geoglyphs whenColonel Antonio R. P. Labre stayed among them in 1887. From Labre we also learnthat the Aroanas had “temples and a form of worship” and that their religiousofficiants were “medicine men.”During the twentieth century the term “medicine men” went out of fashion and,where indigenous systems of spirituality are still practiced in the Amazontoday, the majority of ethnographic and anthropological studies define theofficiants as “shamans.” This word is NOT derived from, or used, in anyAmazonian language. It comes, instead, from the Tungus-Mongol noun saman,meaning, broadly, “one who knows.”7 [part0051.html#note691]Its widespread use by anthropologists today—not only with reference to religiousritual functionaries in the Amazon but also to similar figures who are found intribal and hunter-gatherer societies all over the world—has not come aboutbecause the Tungus mysteriously contacted and influenced other cultures butbecause Tungus shamanism was the first example of the phenomenon to be studiedby European ethnologists. The Tungus word entered Western languages throughtheir enthusiastic written reports and has subsequently continued to be appliedin all parts of the world where systems very similar to Tungus shamanism havebeen found.It is the shaman—usually a man but sometimes a woman—who stands at the heart ofthese systems. And what all shamans have in common, regardless of which culturethey come from or what they call themselves, is an ability to enter and controlaltered states of consciousness. Often, but not always, psychedelic plants orfungi are consumed to attain the necessary trance state. Shamanism, therefore,is not primarily a set of beliefs, nor the result of purposive study. It is,first and foremost, mastery of the techniques needed to attain trance and thusto occasion particular kinds of experiences—shamans call them “visions,” Westernpsychiatrists call them “hallucinations”—that are then in turn used to interpretevents and guide behavior:The true shaman must attain his knowledge and position through trance, visionand soul-journey to the Otherworld. All these states of enlightenment arereached … during a shamanic state of consciousness, and not by purposive studyand application of a corpus of systematic knowledge.8 [part0051.html#note692]Such a method of knowledge acquisition seems absurd and fantastical to the“rational” Western mind. And indeed, underlying the whole notion ofsoul-journeys to the otherworld is a model of reality that is diametricallyopposed in every way to the model presently favored by Western science. Thisremotely ancient shamanistic model holds our material world to be much morecomplicated than it seems to be. Behind it, beneath it, above it,interpenetrating it, all around it—sometimes symbolized as being “underground”or sometimes “in the sky”—is an otherworld, perhaps multiple otherworlds (spiritworlds, underworlds, netherworlds, etc.) inhabited by supernatural beings.Whether we like it or not, we must interact with these nonphysical beings,which, though generally invisible and intangible, have the power both to harm usand to help us.THE GEOMETRICAL PULSETHE BIG PICTURE OF SHAMANISM, altered states of consciousness, and theirimmensely important place in the human story—was the focus of my 2005 bookSupernatural: Meetings with the Ancient Teachers of Mankind.9[part0051.html#note693] I refer the reader to that book for a comprehensive bodyof data that reinforces and underlines what I have to say in this chapter.Meanwhile, the key point, standing right at the heart of the matter andnonsensical to “rational” Western minds, is the notion that the human conditionrequires interaction with powerful nonphysical beings. Across much of the Amazonthe nexus that facilitates such interaction is the extraordinary visionary brewayahuasca, a plant medicine that has been in use among the indigenous peoples ofthis vast region for unknown thousands of years. Its active ingredient, derivedfrom the leaves of the chacruna shrub (botanical name Psychotria viridis) isdimethyltryptamine—DMT—an immensely potent hallucinogen. It is from the otheringredient, however, derived from the Banisteriopsis caapi vine, that the brewgets its name. The function of the ayahuasca vine in the brew is to transmit amonoamine oxidase inhibitor into the bloodstream of the recipient so that he orshe may gain sustained access to the extraordinary effects of DMT—a substancethat is normally neutralized in the gut by the enzyme monoamine oxidase. Thereare other ways of accessing the visionary power of Amazonian plants rich inDMT—notably by snorting them as snuff—but the effects are short-lasting. Takenorally, in the form of the ayahuasca brew, however, the experience can last upto 6 hours, permitting a much more sustained and immersive trance “journey.”It is, in my view, a remarkable scientific feat that such a highly effectivecombination of just 2 out of the estimated 150,000 different species of plants,trees, and vines in the Amazon was discovered by mere trial and error. Nor ifyou ask Amazonian shamans, as I have done, how their ancestors made thisdiscovery, will they admit to trial and error at all—or indeed to any othermethod that Western science would recognize as rational. What they claim, verysimply—but unanimously—is that a variety of “plant spirits,” among whichayahuasca is paramount, have taught them everything important they need to knowabout the properties of other plants in the jungle, thus allowing them to makepowerful medicines, to heal the sick, and, in general, to be good “doctors.”10[part0051.html#note694]Ayahuasca itself is said to be a “doctor,” possessing a strong spirit, and isconsidered to be “an intelligent being with which it is possible to establishrapport, and from which it is possible to acquire knowledge and power.”11[part0051.html#note695] The anthropologist Angelica Gebhart-Sayer, who studiedthe Shipibo-Conibo people of the Amazon, notes that under the influence ofayahuasca “the shaman perceives, from the spirit world, incomprehensible, oftenchaotic information in the form of luminous designs.”12 [part0051.html#note696]As Gebhart-Sayer sees it, it is the shaman’s function to decode and“domesticate” this raw, unprocessed data beamed at him by the plant spirits by“converting it” into therapy for the tribe as a whole.Very often these luminous designs, rich in data, take the form of geometry. Ispeak from experience, having participated in more than seventy ayahuascasessions since 2003, continuing to work with the brew for the valuable lessonsit teaches me long after Supernatural was researched, written, and published.Here’s part of my account of the first time I drank ayahuasca in the Amazon:I raise the cup to my lips again. About two thirds of the measure that theshaman poured for me still remains, and now I drain it in one draught. Theconcentrated bittersweet foretaste, followed instantly by the aftertaste of rotand medicine, hits me like a punch in the stomach. … Feeling slightlyapprehensive, I thank the shaman and wander back to my place on the floor. …Time passes but I don’t keep track of it. I’ve improvized a pillow from arolled-up sleeping bag and I now find I’m swamped by a powerful feeling ofweariness. My muscles involuntarily relax, I close my eyes, and without fanfarea parade of visions suddenly begins, visions that are at once geometrical andalive, visions of lights unlike any light I’ve ever seen—dark lights, a pulsing,swirling field of the deepest luminescent violets, of reds emerging out ofnight, of unearthly textures and colors, of solar systems revolving, of spiralgalaxies on the move. Visions of nets and strange ladder-like structures.Visions in which I seem to see multiple square screens stacked side by side andon top of each other to form immense patterns of windows arranged in greatbanks. Though they manifest without sound in what seems to be a pristine andlimitless vacuum, the images possess a most peculiar and particular quality.They feel like a drum-roll—as though their real function is to announce thearrival of something else.13 [part0051.html#note697]Other notes I made following my ayahuasca sessions in the Amazon refer to a“geometrical pulse,”14 [part0051.html#note698] to “a recurrence of thegeometrical patterns,”15 [part0051.html#note699] to “a background of shiftinggeometrical patterns,”16 [part0051.html#note700] and to “complex interlacedpatterns of geometry. … I zoom in for a closer view. … They’re rectangular,outlined in black, like windows. There’s a circle in the centre of eachrectangle.”17 [part0051.html#note701]PATHSTHOSE SESSIONS TOOK PLACE IN January and February 2004 some years before I firstlearned of the existence of the great geometrical geoglyphs of the Amazon. Thereader will understand, therefore, that when I began to research the glyphs in2017 and to wonder about their meaning to whichever unknown peoples createdthem, it was natural for me to consider ayahuasca as an inspiration. I can’tconfirm whether any circles within rectangles are among the more than 550 glyphsdiscovered by 2018, but Jacó Sá (where the Manchineri group brought bySaunaluoma and Virtanen reported sensations of being in an ancient ritualatmosphere) certainly gives us a circle within a square. And, while thegeometrical patterns that I likened to “multiple square screens” and “banks ofwindows” might be described and manifested using very different materials invery different ways by people from different cultural backgrounds, what seems tostay constant throughout is the geometry.Image Missing [../images/00071.jpeg]Tukano sand painting of patterns seen in an ayahuasca vision. (After G.Reichel-Dolmatoff, The Shaman and the Jaguar, 1975, p. 46.)It is the fundamental motif of the earthworks but it turns up in much elsebesides—for example in the ayahuasca-inspired art of the Tukano of the ColombianAmazon (where the brew goes by the name of yajé).18 [part0051.html#note702]The Tukano create geometrical patterns and abstract designs in sand, on fabricsand musical instruments, on their houses and on the communal malocas where theyconsume yajé.19 [part0051.html#note703] Colombian anthropologist GerardoReichel-Dolmatoff reported the results of an intriguing experiment he carriedout in which he asked members of a Tukano community to make crayon drawings ofwhat they saw when they were drinking yajé. (The drawings were of course madefrom memory, after the drinkers had returned to everyday consciousness.)The results, broadly identical to the designs on the houses and fabrics,included a triangle flanked by vertical lines ending in spirals, a rhomboid, arectangular design filled with parallel lines, patterns of parallel undulatinglines drawn horizontally, a number of different oval- and U-shaped elements,rows of dots or small circles, a vertical pattern of little dots, grid patterns,zigzag lines, nested rectangles, nested parallel arcs (catenary curves), and soon.20 [part0051.html#note704] Significantly, the Tukano also paint identicalshapes and patterns on rock faces in the hills of the northwest Amazon.21[part0051.html#note705]More than seventy different indigenous Amazonian cultures use ayahuasca—manygiving different names to the brew (yajé, natema, caapi, cipo, shori, etc.).22[part0051.html#note706] Since almost all report seeing geometrical visions, Iwasn’t surprised to discover that Saunaluoma and Virtanen were already far aheadof me in contemplating a connection between ayahuasca visions as expressed inindigenous art and the immense geoglyphs now emerging from jungle clearancesalong the southern rim of the Amazon.Of the contemporary Manchineri, for example (who live much closer to the ancientearthworks than the Tukano), they note in a 2015 paper that “certain geometricmotifs,” often expressed in ceramics and body paintings, “have meaning as signsof specific ancestors. Some ancestors possess their own geometric designs thatmay appear in shamanic ayahuasca visions, transmitting ancestral knowledge andpower.”23 [part0051.html#note707]They therefore conclude that “not only using but also constructing geometricearthworks may have been important social intra-group or inter-group events.”24[part0051.html#note708]In a follow-up paper, published in American Anthropologist in August 2017,Saunaluoma and Virtanen take their analysis much further, proposing that thegeoglyphs “were systematically constructed as spaces especially laden withvisible and invisible entities.”25 [part0051.html#note709] Their argument isthat, regardless of scale or medium, the whole process of materializingvisionary iconography, in particular geometric patterns, is “related to thefluid forms inhabiting the Amazonian relational world. Different designs ‘bring’the presence of nonhumans to the visible world of humans for a number ofAmazonian Indigenous peoples, while perceiving geometric designs in Amerindianart as paths from one dimension to another allows a viewer to shift betweendifferent worlds, from the visible to the invisible.”26 [part0051.html#note710]Citing the work of their colleague Luisa Belaunde, Saunaluoma and Virtanen notethat for the Shipibo-Conibo of the Peruvian Amazon, “the lines embody a packageof ways in which beings move, travel, communicate between themselves, andtransmit knowledge, objects, and powers. These paths exist everywhere, frommacro to micro scales. Geometric designs are thus about certain ways ofthinking, perceiving, and indicating invisible aspects so they can be seen.”27[part0051.html#note711]Saunaluoma and Virtanen further establish that, to the Shipibo-Conibo, thegeometric lines open “a window to the macrocosmos” and allow “macrocosmic order”to be “iconically sketched in the microcosmos here, in landscape designs.”28[part0051.html#note712]As above, so below.PORTALBY TAKING THE WORLDVIEW, INSIGHTS, and philosophies of indigenous peoplesseriously in efforts to understand their past, Saunaluoma and Virtanen’sresearch marks a refreshing change of note for Western science and offersrewarding insights into the realm of ideas underlying the geoglyphs. It is by nomeans a realm of “primitive” ideas. On the contrary: with its notions ofpathways between dimensions, and of making visible the presence of usuallyinvisible entities, there are aspects of thought surrounding the traditional useof ayahuasca that would not be out of place in a quantum physics laboratory.Once again I suggest we are looking at the remnants of an advanced system thatpropagates itself through time and across cultures with powerful memes amongwhich geometry and cosmic alignments take a large share. We do not know where orwhen this system originated. In the ancient Amazon, however, to a greater degreethan anywhere else, its dissemination became integrated with the use ofvision-inducing plants—and there, up to the present day, the secrets of how touse these plants have been preserved and passed down within indigenous shamanictraditions.The origin myth of the Tukano speaks of the time, eons ago, when humans firstsettled the great rivers of the Amazon basin. It seems that “supernaturalbeings” accompanied them on this journey and gifted them the fundamentals uponwhich to build a civilized life. From the “Daughter of the Sun” they receivedthe gift of fire and the knowledge of horticulture, pottery-making, and manyother crafts. “The serpent-shaped canoe of the first settlers” was steered by asuperhuman “Helmsman.”29 [part0051.html#note713] Meanwhile other supernaturals“travelled by canoe over all the rivers and … explored the remote hill ranges;they pointed out propitious sites for houses or fields, or for hunting andfishing, and they left their lasting imprint on many spots so that futuregenerations would have ineffaceable proof of their earthly days and wouldforever remember them and their teachings.”30 [part0051.html#note714]The slow, methodical progress of the serpent canoe, setting down its cargo ofmigrants here and there, explains anthropologist Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff:Was marked not only by the successive spots of debarkation but also by anadvancing scale of human achievement. …The rules for the initiation into shamanism were laid down, accompanied by alarge body of prescriptions, regulations and prohibitions that, from now on,were to guide and govern the life of the people.But above all … if mankind was to prevail and survive as part of nature, and wasto pass on a true legacy to new generations, people had to assumeresponsibilities and find ways to control the organization of society so as toprocure a balance between human needs and the resources available in nature.31[part0051.html#note715]In this period “the spirit-beings prepared the land so that mortal humancreatures might live on it.”32 [part0051.html#note716] Once that task had beencompleted, however,the supernatural beings returned to their otherworldly abodes. Before leaving …they took care to provide mankind with the means of communication, ofestablishing contact with them whenever there should be need. Mortal men couldnot be left alone without the possibility of communing with the spirit-world. …It was essential, then, for the welfare of mankind to have at its disposal asimple and effective means by which, at any given moment, an individual or agroup of people could establish contact with the supernatural sphere.33[part0051.html#note717]It is rather brutally to compress many colorful and thought-provoking details tosay that at the end of the lengthy myth, the “effective means” of contacting thespirit-world turns out to be … ayahuasca:A plant that opened the door into another dimension, a drug that producedvisions in which the spirit-beings revealed themselves to men—talking, teaching,admonishing and protecting.34 [part0051.html#note718]There are multiple different elements intertwined in the Tukano story but threeof them stand out for me.First, what’s being described is dressed up in the language and imagery of mythand may of course be “just a myth.” What it sounds like, however, is amythologized account of a settlement mission in the Amazon in which a group ofmigrants were accompanied by a number of more sophisticated people considered tobe “supernatural” or “superhuman.”Though I don’t want to put undue weight on it, I would be negligent if I failedto mention in passing that the Tukano, and the closely related Barasana, areamong a number of Amazonian tribes whose distinctive “men’s cults” areparalleled by virtually identical institutions in Melanesia, on the oppositeside of the Pacific Ocean. As the reader will discover in appendix 1, the samesecrecy surrounding male initiation rituals is found in both areas, the sameexclusive possession of sacred flutes and trumpets that women are forbidden tosee,35 [part0051.html#note719] the same belief that there was a time when womendominated men, and the same belief that men, either by trickery or force, hadsubsequently wrested power from women.Second, the Tukano origin myth makes it completely clear that the“supernaturals” departed after they had completed their work of preparing theAmazon for settlement by the migrants in the serpent canoe.Third, we are led to understand that direct contact between humanity and thespirit world would thereafter be broken. However a portal—ayahuasca—throughwhich humans could still travel to the spirit world, and benefit from itsteachings, would be left open.THE LEAP TO THE MILKY WAYALTHOUGH ANY MEMBER OF THE Tukano community may drink ayahuasca, the deepermysteries of the brew are primarily the work of the shaman—the payé—whoseresponsibility it is to travel through the portal whenever required to negotiatewith powerful supernaturals on behalf of his community. Where matters of thegreatest importance must be resolved, a group of payé will work together,consuming massive quantities of ayahuasca until they reach a point, lying intheir hammocks, where theyfeel they are ascending to the Milky Way. … The ascent to the Milky Way is noteasily accomplished. An apprentice will hardly ever be able to rise immediatelyto this … region but rather will learn to do so after many trials. At first hewill barely rise over the horizon, the next time perhaps he will reach a pointcorresponding to the position of the sun at 9 a.m., then at 10 a.m., and so onuntil at last, in a single, soaring flight, he will reach the zenith.36[part0051.html#note720]In summary, therefore, the shaman’s visionary journey through the ayahuascaportal involves a leap or, after sufficient practice, a “soaring flight,” to theMilky Way. It is not the final goal, however, but a way station. “Beyond theMilky Way” lies the entrance to the Otherworld. As Reichel-Dolmatoff explains:It is said that the individual “dies” when he drinks the potion and that now hisspirit returns to the uterine regions of the Beyond, only to be reborn there andto return to his ordinary existence when the trance is over. This then isconceived as an acceleration of time, an anticipation of death and rebirth.37[part0051.html#note721]HIDDEN HANDTHE TUKANO OTHERWORLD IS DIVIDED into regions or districts and one of these, ofparticular interest to shamans, is the domain of Vai-mahase, the supernatural“Master of Animals.” It is a strangely geometrical “hill” in the form of asquare with its four sides oriented to the cardinal directions.38[part0051.html#note722]Is it an accident that geometry arises spontaneously in ayahuasca visions? Andis it an accident that it does so not only among Amazonian peoples in the Amazonitself, but—as my own experiences and multiple scientific studies haveproved—among peoples from industrialized cultures as well?39[part0051.html#note723] Whether you drink the brew in the rainforest, or in NewYork, London, Frankfurt, or Tokyo, it is a plain fact that sooner or later youare going to see geometry.40 [part0051.html#note724]Image Missing [../images/00072.jpeg]Entrance to the “Otherworld” as depicted in Tukano visionary art. (After G.Reichel-Dolmatoff, The Shaman and the Jaguar, 1975, p. 174.)Is the presence of some deeper enigma hinted at here—an enigma that the ancientshad plumbed when they devised their memes and sent them ringing down the ages?Just because our high-tech civilization has demonized psychedelics for the last50 years doesn’t mean that other societies in the past did so. Indeed it’slikely that these powerful agents of transformation were used by ancientcivilizations for profound and far-reaching inquiries into aspects of realityabout which our own high-tech civilization remains willfully ignorant.41[part0051.html#note725]We’ve seen that ayahuasca has many different names among the many differentpeoples who use it across the Amazon, but the word ayahuasca itself is from theQuechua language of the high Andes overlooking the western edge of the Amazonbasin. This is the language that was spoken by the remarkable Inca civilizationof Peru in the few short centuries before its destruction by the Spaniards. Inthat language what ayahuasca means is the “Vine of the Dead” or the “Vine ofSouls.”The memes of geometry and cosmic alignments are not the only ones to havepropagated from a so far unidentified common source. Intimately connected tothem are other ideas that went “viral” in both the Old World and the New, andthat therefore somehow transcended the Ice Age separation of peoples.Image Missing [../images/00073.jpeg]LEFT: Plan (by Martti Pärssinen) of Fazenda Colorada, Upper Amazon Basingeoglyph site (see chapter 16[part0027.html#PNV60-6d489586c24d4bc6a7d8fba43c80bb24]).

On theway you’ll cross the Equator and the Tropic of Cancer. Google informs me thatthe flight time will be about 11 hours, including a stopover in the DominicanRepublic.It wasn’t so simple in the ancient world. Although sections of the journey couldhave been made by sea most of the route would have been overland through somegeographically very challenging parts of Central America and involving,ultimately, much more than 6,000 kilometers.This is not to say that such a great distance must necessarily have ruled outany communication and interchange between the two regions. On the contrary, itis not in dispute that the peoples of South and North America are more closelyrelated genetically to each other than they are to anyone else, that there aresome linguistic connections, and that crops such as maize or manioc that hadbeen domesticated in one region were also grown in the other—though sometimeswith a significant time lag. In summary, the evidence confirms that there werecontacts but it also suggests that they were random and infrequent rather thanregular and sustained.Image Missing [../images/00077.jpeg]The two giant river basins of the Americas (note, maps not to scale). The AmazonRiver basin (left) has a total area of 7.5 million square kilometers. TheMississippi River basin (right) has a total area of 2.9 million squarekilometers.What, then, are we to make of the fact that stunningly similar earthworksrepeating stunningly similar geometric themes on a stunningly similar scale tothose of the Amazon River basin are also found in the Mississippi River basin?Are the resemblances coincidental?Or did they arise during one of the random and infrequent episodes of contact?Or is there some other explanation?It’s June 14, 2017, a week before the summer solstice, and I’m chewing overthese questions with Santha while we stand on top of an earthwork called “MonksMound” at the sacred heart of the ancient Mississippian city of Cahokia.Looking southwest from this vantage point what stands out, about 8 miles away,are the twin A-shaped support towers and cable ties of the Stan Musial VeteransMemorial Bridge, joining Illinois to Missouri across the Mississippi River, anda couple of miles farther south along the Mississippi waterside the glittering,stainless-steel Gateway Arch of the city of St. Louis. Conceived as “a publicmemorial to the men who made possible the western territorial expansion of theUnited States,”1 [part0051.html#note727] the arch reaches a height of 630 feetand is claimed to be the tallest man-made monument in the Western Hemisphere andthe tallest arch in the world.The contrast between old and new is abrupt—for the ancient mounds and earthworksof the Mississippi Valley, even gigantic sites like Cahokia, have an understatedquality. They don’t radiate the brash and boastful self-importance of so many ofour modern structures—such as the skyscraper One Metropolitan Square, which at593 feet high seems to do battle with the Gateway Arch to dominate the St. Louisskyline. Neither do they overwhelm you with their grandeur and their majesty,like the pyramids of ancient Egypt and Mexico. Nor do they wear their mysteriesin full view like the great moai of Easter Island. Instead an elegant synthesisbetween heaven and earth seems to have been sought out. In consequence evenMonks Mound, on the 100-foot-tall summit of which we’re now standing, is soseamlessly integrated with its setting that it seems almost as much a work ofnature as of man.Indeed this was precisely the view of Dr. A. R. Crook, director of the IllinoisState Museum and a geologist by training, who undertook the first “scientific”investigations of Monks Mound in 1914. His theory, shared by many of hiscolleagues at the time and perhaps colored by an underlying prejudice thatprehistoric Native Americans would not have been capable of building on such ascale, was that the mounds of Cahokia were entirely natural “erosionalremnants.” In 1914 Crook drilled twenty-five shallow augur holes into the northface of Monks Mound, found nothing to change his view and—as late as 1921—wascontinuing to declare, as though it were an established and objective fact, thatthe mounds were merely glacial and alluvial deposits and thus of noarchaeological interest.2 [part0051.html#note728]This mattered because other, wiser, scholars were already absolutely certainthat the Cahokia complex was man-made and of outstanding archaeological interestand had mounted a campaign to save the mounds from further destruction at thehands of farmers and industrialists. Crook’s claims that they were naturalformations were therefore most unhelpful and had to be refuted before furtherprogress could be made.This challenge was duly taken up by archaeologist Warren T. Moorehead, whojoined forces with geologist Morris Leighton to undertake a much more thoroughinvestigation of the mounds in 1922 than Crook had mounted in 1914. Afterseveral test pits had been dug on the Fourth Terrace and on the east side ofMonks Mound, including auguring to a depth of 20 feet, the results, in the formof artifacts and exposed construction levels, were too conclusive and compellingto be dismissed.3 [part0051.html#note729] Even Crook was convinced andthereafter abandoned his position that the mounds were natural features4[part0051.html#note730]—a position that today, in the light of subsequentextensive excavations around Cahokia and at Monks Mound, seems absurd.Nonetheless, there remain many who would seek by one means or another to takeCahokia away from the Native Americans who built it. Since it can no longer becredibly claimed as a natural erosional feature, the fallback position, popularin the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries but repeatedly returned toeven now, is that the great city, and others like it up and down the MississippiValley, must have been the work of some superior “master-race” of white-skinnedforeigners who reached America in antiquity and built the mounds with theiradvanced skills and techniques but were then driven off or wiped out by native“savages.”5 [part0051.html#note731]Frequently compounded by rumors of “giants” or “aliens,” such reasoning hasalready been comprehensively refuted by excavations proving to the satisfactionof anyone capable of logical thought that the mounds, including Monks Mound—that“stupendous pile of earth” as one early explorer described it6[part0051.html#note732]—are indeed the work of Native Americans.7[part0051.html#note733]The very name of the great mound, however, demonstrates the effects of theongoing casual misappropriation of indigenous achievements. It bears that namesimply because a group of Trappist monks—immigrants from France—grew vegetableson its terraces for a few years either side of AD 1810,8 [part0051.html#note734]but it was built around AD 1050 by the Native American civilizationarchaeologists call the Mississippians.9 [part0051.html#note735]We don’t know what the people of that civilization called themselves and wedon’t know what they called Monks Mound. We do know, however, that they thoughtand worked on a grand scale, as I shall show, and that they made use of the samekinds of geometry and astronomy deployed at Serpent Mound, 420 miles to theeast, and in the great earthworks and mounds of the Amazon thousands of miles tothe south.TWO VALLEYSDESPITE THE PROMISING CLUES OFFERED by ethnographic research into the likelyrole played by vision-inducing plants and shamanic experiences, the fact remainsthat we are confronted across huge expanses of the Amazon by such severelylimited archaeological data that it’s impossible to give responsible, informedanswers to three fundamental questions: * What motivated the creation of the mounds and geoglyphs? * When were the very first structures of this kind made? * Where and how were the requisite design, planning, engineering, and architectural skills developed?In the Amazon, on all three counts, we simply don’t know. Moreover, ourignorance is compounded by the absence of any detailed geometrical orarchaeoastronomical surveys of the earthworks and mounds thus far discovered andby the fact that millions of square kilometers of the rainforest have never beenstudied by archaeologists at all.It’s quite a different story in the Mississippi Valley, which is not veiled byvast areas of near-impenetrable jungle and where mounds and earthworksremarkably similar to those now coming to light in the Amazon have been thesubject of more than 170 years of intensive archaeological investigation.10[part0051.html#note736] Because they were always in plain view, however, andbecause they often occupied land that was desirable for agricultural orindustrial purposes, the vast majority of the immense prehistoric structures ofthe Mississippi Valley no longer exist. An estimated 90 percent are gone—eitherpartially or completely demolished and cleared away in the obliteration of NorthAmerica’s past that began with the European conquest.So just as archaeologists in the Amazon have only a limited database from whichto construct their theories, because the jungle covers so much, it’s also thecase that archaeologists in the Mississippi Valley have only a limited databasebecause so much has been destroyed. Still, they’ve achieved a great deal withthe roughly 10 percent of the original total of sites that have survived and itmay not be too much to hope that their discoveries could shed light on themysterious counterpart mounds and earthworks of the Amazon.EARTH ISLAND, SKY WORLDFROM CHAPTER 16, THE READER may recall Severino Calazans, an Amazonian earthworkwith the same 13-acre footprint and the same orientation to the cardinaldirections as the Great Pyramid of Giza. Though rectangular rather than square(910 feet from north to south and 720 feet from east to west), Monks Mound has a14-acre footprint.11 [part0051.html#note737]Considered as a pyramid—and it is indeed a form of step pyramid—it comes thirdin the Americas after the Pyramid of Quetzalcoatl at Cholula and the Pyramid ofthe Sun at Teotihuacan,12 [part0051.html#note738] both of which arestone-reinforced monuments and significantly taller.Considered an earthwork, and echoing that early explorer’s report, Monks Moundhas been described as “stupendous in many ways. It is the tallest mound, coversthe most area and contains the most volume of any prehistoric earthen monumentin the Americas.”13 [part0051.html#note739] It is, moreover, part of a giantcomplex with multiple different elements including more than 100 subsidiaryearthen mounds, the archaeological traces of what was once a spectacular circleof huge wooden posts (known as Cahokia’s “Woodhenge”), a spacious central plaza,and an 18-meter-wide, 800-meter-long earthwork causeway running arrow-straightbetween raised embankments.Enigmatically, but quite deliberately set to an azimuth of 005 degrees—that is,5 degrees east of true north—it is this causeway, referred to by archaeologistsas the “Rattlesnake Causeway,” that defines Cahokia’s principal axis,14[part0051.html#note740] giving the site a certain ambiguity and adding to itsair of mystery. Every mound and earthwork is set out upon the ground in strictrelation to it, with clusters of structures, dominated by Monks Mound itself,running south to north and other clusters running west to east.It’s easy to understand, then, why the first and most powerful impression I getoverlooking this massive ancient site from the top of Monks Mound is of itsdistinct “cardinality.” Exactly as is the case at Giza and Angkor—both of whichare aligned within fractions of a single degree to true north—so, too, here atCahokia. Despite its puzzling 5-degree offset there’s no mistaking where to lookfor the cardinal directions. Something about the place—something intended andcarefully thought through by its original designers—immediately connects you toboth earth and sky.Image Missing [../images/00078.jpeg]Detail of Monks Mound and some of its immediately adjoining structures.Image Missing [../images/00079.jpeg]Running through the Grand Plaza and Monks Mound, and extending northward beyondMonks Mound, the Rattlesnake Causeway defines Cahokia’s 5 degrees east of northaxis.Image Missing [../images/00080.jpeg]Lidar image reveals how Monks Mound is bounded by plazas and other significantstructures on its north, south, east, and west sides. IMAGE BY WILLIAM ROMAIN.This sense of terrestrial and cosmic connectedness is among several cogentlyargued reasons why archaeologist William Romain, whose work at Serpent Mound weencountered in part 1, considers Monks Mound to have been conceived by itsdesigners as a true “axis mundi”—intended to serve as a junction point betweenheaven and earth. He reminds us of the traditional shamanistic spiritual systemof the Native American peoples of the Eastern Woodlands—the region of Cahokia.According to this system, the universe is comprised “of an Above World, ThisWorld, and Below World. … Connecting these realms is a vertical vector … theaxis mundi that enables shamans to move between cosmic realms. … The axis mundican be symbolically represented by any number of vertical elements such as apole, tree, column of smoke, mountain, pyramid, or mound.”15[part0051.html#note741]Monks Mound has the look of a small mountain, Romain observes. It dwarfseverything in the surrounding landscape and utterly dominates Cahokia. Thischaracter of “verticality” is enhanced by the local topography of theMississippi floodplain, which would have ensured that the Grand Plaza wasregularly, if shallowly, inundated. Out of the watery, marshy realm thuscreated, Monks Mound would have seemed to rear up in numinous and mythic powerand was perhaps, Romain writes:imagined as an earth island. … If the Below World as represented by thewetlands, swamps, lakes, and man-made water features surrounding central Cahokiais a watery world, then it is appropriate that in its verticality, Monks Moundwould be the structural axis mundi linking the watery Below World to the AboveSky World.16 [part0051.html#note742]Interestingly, and again despite the 5-degree offset from true north so firmlydeclared by Cahokia’s principal axis, the largest known building of theMississippian civilization was erected on the apex of Monks Mound and in thiscase was precisely aligned to the cardinal directions.17 [part0051.html#note743]Its long axis, measuring 30.85 meters, was set perfectly east–west; its shortaxis, measuring 13.85 meters, was set perfectly north–south.18[part0051.html#note744]Image Missing [../images/00081.jpeg]Archaeologists have established that a large structure, perfectly aligned to thecardinal directions, once stood on the summit of Monks Mound. IMAGE BY WILLIAMROMAIN.Image Missing [../images/00082.jpeg]The workings of Cahokia’s Woodhenge. PHOTO BY WILLIAM ISEMINGER; ANNOTATIONS BYWILLIAM ROMAIN.Romain also draws our attention to “the powerful visual hierophany” that wouldhave been witnessed at the spring and fall equinoxes when Cahokia was in itsprime, locking the site in to key conjunctions of heaven and earth. It was inthe staging of this hierophany that the site’s “Woodhenge” played its mostcrucial role. Re-created with a modern simulacrum for the benefit of the 300,000tourists who now visit Cahokia each year, and named after the similarprehistoric circle of huge wooden posts that stood on England’s Salisbury Plainclose to the world-famous site of Stonehenge before the stone circle itself wascompleted, Cahokia’s Woodhenge lies some 850 meters west of Monks Mound. Itsexistence remained unsuspected until the 1960s when archaeologist Warren Wittryfound traces of immense postholes. Subsequent excavations revealed that no fewerthan five woodhenges had been built on the same site over a period of a coupleof centuries in order to accommodate increases in the size and shape of theMound itself, which affected crucial solar sight lines.Image Missing [../images/00083.jpeg]Equinox sunrise above the slope of the southern terrace of Monks Mound.PHOTOGRAPHED FROM WOODHENGE BY WILLIAM ROMAIN.The objective of every realignment and rededication was that an observer at thecenter of the post circle, looking due east across the “front sight” of aspecially placed equinox marker post, should see the sun’s disk appear above theslope of the southern terrace of Monks Mound—an arrangement, says Romain, thatestablishes an east–west solar-oriented line across the entire Cahokia complex:The result is that Monks Mound is visually connected to the Above World vis ávis the rising sun and its location on the east–west sightline that intersectsthe major site axis. In this way, Monks Mound is positioned at a center place.19[part0051.html#note745]That assertion and manifestation of centrality is reconfirmed by two other postsat Woodhenge that serve as front sights targeting the horizon azimuths of thesummer and winter solstice sunrises.20 [part0051.html#note746]ENTER THE MOONTHE CIRCLES, RECTANGLES, AND SQUARES of Cahokia, the solstitial and equinoctialalignments, and the perfect cardinality of the large structure that once stoodatop Monks Mound are among the hallmarks of the same distinct pattern ofgeometry and astronomy that we find in the Amazon earthworks.Unexplained so far, however, is why Cahokia’s designers made a deliberate choicenot to align the main axis of their premier site to the cardinal directions ofearth and sky but instead chose to offset it by 5 degrees east of true north?It’s a question to which William Romain offers an intriguing answer. Thebuilders of Cahokia, he argues, were geometricians who made use of a specialrectangle, known as a “root-2 rectangle,” in planning the layout of the city.He gives much supporting evidence for this claim, which need not detain ushere.21 [part0051.html#note747] Nor do we want to get bogged down in unnecessarytechnical detail. In brief, however, a root-2 rectangle is constructed byextending the opposite sides of a square to the length of the square’s diagonal.If you take such a rectangle, orient it to true north (0 degrees azimuth), andthen rotate it eastward by 5 degrees to match the azimuth of Cahokia’s principalaxis, its diagonals turn out to align closely with important solar and lunarevents as viewed from Monks Mound—specifically, the summer solstice sunrise atazimuth 59.7 degrees, the winter solstice sunset at azimuth 239.3 degrees, themoon’s maximum southern rising position at azimuth 130.1 degrees, and the moon’smaximum northern setting position at azimuth 307.1 degrees.Image Missing [../images/00084.jpeg]The match, Romain admits, “is not perfect. A couple of the celestial azimuthsdiffer from the diagonals of the root two rectangle by 2 to 3 degrees. But sincethe rectangle is not intended for observational purposes it is perhaps closeenough to symbolically represent the complementary opposite relationships of thesun and moon.”22 [part0051.html#note748]If Romain is right, then it appears that sophisticated astronomical andmathematical ideas, combined with complex and cleverly thought throughsymbolism, were already present, fully worked out, and in the hands of competentprofessionals when Cahokia underwent what archaeologists call its “big bang”—anexplosive period of expansion and development—around AD 1050.23[part0051.html#note749]Is there evidence that such ideas were deployed elsewhere in North Americabefore Cahokia?"},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00085.jpeg]MOONWILLIAM ROMAIN’S CASE THAT NOT only solar but also lunar connections weremediated through geometry in the alignments of Cahokia is strengthened by thefact that other significantly older earthwork sites, most of which weredestroyed by “development” in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, were builtin the Mississippi River basin incorporating complex geometries based almostexclusively on lunar alignments. Two of the most significant such sites to havesurvived, at least in part, into the twenty-first century are the High BankWorks and Newark Earthworks, both in Ohio. High Bank Works is located near thetown of Chillicothe, about 40 miles northeast of Serpent Mound, and NewarkEarthworks stands about 60 miles farther to the northeast near the town ofNewark.Both are true geoglyphs in the Amazonian sense, being formed by embankments andditches set out on such a gigantic scale that their shape is not evident atground level and can only be discerned clearly from the air.Image Missing [../images/00086.jpeg]Image Missing [../images/00087.jpeg]This 1934 aerial photograph shows the Circle-Octagon combination of the NewarkEarthworks. Those parts that still survive are now largely contained within aprivate country club that includes an eighteen-hole golf course and promotesitself as “unlike any other in the world. It is designed around famousprehistoric Native American Earthworks that come into play on eleven of theholes.”Both are dominated by immense octagon-circle combinations linked by shortcauseways amid assemblies of other geometrical figures. Both are currentlythought to date to between AD 250 and 400.1 [part0051.html#note750] Both areattributed to a culture that archaeologists have named the “Hopewell”—after acertain Captain M. C. Hopewell, who happened to own a farm in the right placewhen excavations began.2 [part0051.html#note751]Newark and High Bank were first professionally surveyed in the mid-nineteenthcentury when numerous mounds—most subsequently leveled for plowing or industrialpurposes—were reported to be situated within the geometrical earthworks.3[part0051.html#note752] It may therefore be relevant to recall at this pointthat many of the Amazonian geoglyphs described in chapter 15 also containmounds—for example, eleven arranged in a circle within an immense enclosure inthe Upper Tapajos Basin,4 [part0051.html#note753] the “two high mounds, standinglike towers” at the southwestern entrance of the trapezoidal earthwork atFazenda Colorada,5 [part0051.html#note754] the twenty-five adjoining mounds ofFazenda Iquiri II,6 [part0051.html#note755] and the ten surviving mounds ofCoqueiral.7 [part0051.html#note756]Whereas no archaeoastronomical survey of the Amazonian earthworks has yet beenattempted, Cahokia and Serpent Mound have both been subject to intense scrutiny.Meanwhile, at Newark and High Bank a series of studies since the 1980s haverevealed a complex symphony of geometry and astronomy encoding not only familiarsolar alignments but also, as we are about to see, much more subtle and esotericconjunctions of heaven and earth concerned with the complex dance along thehorizon of the rising and setting moon.PCBSNEWARK AND HIGH BANK HAVE an almost technological feel to them, resemblinggigantic printed circuit boards or wiring diagrams from the innards of someimmense and ineffable instrument. It’s interesting, therefore, that BradleyLepper, currently curator of archaeology with the Ohio History Connection,believes they may originally have been conceived by their designers as thecomponents in “a monumental engine for world renewal … a vast machine, ordevice, designed and built to unleash primordial forces.”8[part0051.html#note757]At both sites the principal geoglyph combines a circle with an octagon and inboth cases these figures are formed by large earthen embankments as much as 12meters wide at the base and typically about 1.7 meters high.9[part0051.html#note758]Image Missing [../images/00088.jpeg]Image Missing [../images/00089.jpeg]Newark Great Circle, also known as the Fairground Circle, with its interiorditch and central three-lobed “Eagle Mound.” The diameter of the circle is 365.9meters (just over 1,200 feet).A striking similarity of general design connects the octagon/circle theme ofNewark and High Bank with the Amazonian geoglyph (see chapter 15[part0026.html#OPEK0-6d489586c24d4bc6a7d8fba43c80bb24]) of Santa Isabel.Although the latter is less geometrically exact than the Ohio examples, this isby no means always the rule since both regions exhibit numbers of extremelyprecise and numbers of more mediocre earthworks.The strict lines of Ohio’s Newark Octagon enclose an area of 50 acres and itseight walls have an average length of 167.7 meters.10 [part0051.html#note759]The adjoining circle, known since the nineteenth century as the “ObservatoryCircle,” encloses an area of 20 acres and has a diameter of 321.3 meters.11[part0051.html#note760] A resurvey of the site, carried out with moderninstruments in 1982, revealed that “the midline of the embankment walls deviatesby no more than 1.2 m at any place from a perfect circle of diameter 321.3 m. Aperfect circle of this diameter would have a circumference of 1009.4 m, whereasthe actual circle has a circumference of 1008.6 m. Thus it is evident that theObservatory Circle very closely approximates a true circle.”12[part0051.html#note761]Located 2 kilometers southeast of the Observatory Circle is a second, larger butless geometrically perfect circle known as the Great Circle and formerly as theFairground Circle, since it was used as the site of the Licking CountyFairgrounds from 1854 to 1933.13 [part0051.html#note762] It encloses an area of30 acres14 [part0051.html#note763] and, though much depleted by misuse and thepassage of time, its earthwork walls today, varying between 1.5 meters and 4.3meters in height and between 11 meters and 17 meters in width,15[part0051.html#note764] still give a sense of the enormity of the originalenterprise. At its center are the remnants of a three-lobed mound, usuallyreferred to as “Eagle Mound” because many visitors have seen in it a resemblanceto a bird with outstretched wings.16 [part0051.html#note765] Archaeologists,however, regard it as “a series of conjoined mounds rather than a specificeffigy form.”17 [part0051.html#note766]Image Missing [../images/00090.jpeg]Images from the 1894 Bureau of Ethnology Survey. Badly damaged even then,Newark’s Great Square (left), also known as “Wright Square” or “the WrightEarthworks,” is almost completely destroyed today, with only a short segment ofone of the four walls remaining. The perimeter of the Great Square is equal tothe circumference of the Great Circle (center), while its area is equal to thearea of the Observatory Circle (right).The diameter of the Great Circle, at 365.9 meters,18 [part0051.html#note767] isof the same order of magnitude as the Neolithic henges in the British Isles.Stonehenge at 110 meters is smaller19 [part0051.html#note768] but Avebury atapproximately 420 meters is larger.20 [part0051.html#note769] Moreover, justlike Avebury and many of the Amazonian earthworks reviewed in chapter 16, astriking feature of Newark’s Great Circle is the massive ditch—as much as 12.5meters wide and 4 meters deep21 [part0051.html#note770]—that runs inside itsembankment walls. Indeed, such a ditch, within rather than outside a circularembankment, is the very definition of a henge.Alongside its circles, and an integral part of the same enormous complex (to theother major elements of which it was joined by causeways), Newark in its primepossessed a square enclosure, “nearly geometrically perfect,”22[part0051.html#note771] with sides averaging 931 feet in length.23[part0051.html#note772] Almost nothing of it remains today but fortunatelyenough was intact when it was surveyed in the nineteenth century, first bySquier and Davis and later by Cyrus Thomas of the Bureau of Ethnology, toestablish its measures exactly. These and subsequent surveys have revealed notonly that “the perimeter of the square earthwork is precisely equal to thecircumference of the Great Circle,” but also, as Bradley Lepper notes, that “itsarea is equal to the area of the Observatory Circle.” In these clearlydeliberate and carefully thought through harmonies, Lepper rightly finds“indications of the remarkable sophistication of the geometry incorporated intothe architecture of the Newark Earthworks.”24 [part0051.html#note773]Image Missing [../images/00091.jpeg]Variations on a theme. LEFT: Ancient Works, Pike County, Ohio, as mapped bySquier and Davis in 1848. RIGHT: Jacó Sá earthwork, the Amazon. PHOTO: RICARDOAZOURY/PULSAR IMAGENS.William Romain is more specific. In his view the creators of this extraordinaryand in some ways rather otherworldly site “were intrigued by the variety ofpossible relationships between a circle and a square. … The idea that seems tobe expressed is that, for every circular enclosure, a corresponding square … canbe related to the circle by geometric means.”25 [part0051.html#note774]“Squaring the circle”—constructing a square with the same area as a givencircle—was of course a geometrical exercise of great interest to the mastermathematicians of ancient Babylon, Egypt, and Greece.26 [part0051.html#note775]The dominant reference frame of modern archaeology does not encourage us tobelieve that any Native North Americans 2,000 years ago would have possessed thenecessary knowledge and skills to perform such an exercise. Yet clearly theydid, for the proof is there at Newark—not scratched on some handy-sized claytablet or papyrus but set out with high precision on the ground in an assemblyof truly gigantic and mysterious earthworks.Many different variations on the same theme, which there is not space to reviewhere, are to be found at other Hopewell sites in Ohio—for example, asquare/circle combination that formerly existed in Pike County. Fortunately, itwas surveyed by Squier and Davis in 1848 and their rendering, in figure 11 ofAncient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley, shows it to have been very similarin concept and plan—and indeed in size—to the earthwork at Jacó Sá in the Amazondescribed in chapter 15. The two figures are not identical, but they appear todemonstrate the identical geometrical principle.From chapter 15 the reader will also recall the recent discovery of a squaredcircle complex within the great henge at Avebury in the British Isles.Are we to resort once again to the archaeological cover-all of “coincidence” toexplain the constant repetition and replication of the same astronomical andgeometrical constructs in earthworks as far apart in space and time as Avebury,Newark, and Jacó Sá? Or could it be that some guided and intentional process, asyet undetected by archaeology, was under way behind the scenes of prehistory?THE CONNECTION TO HIGH BANKWE’VE SEEN HOW THE DIAMETER of the nearly geometrically perfect ObservatoryCircle at Newark is 321.3 meters (1,054 feet). Astronomer Ray Hively andphilosopher Robert Horn of Indiana’s Earlham College, whose comprehensive workat Newark and High Bank in the 1980s provided the foundation for all subsequentstudies, realized that the same length of 321.3 meters had also been used by thebuilders to lay out the Octagon:27 [part0051.html#note776]The conclusion suggested by the geometry of the Observatory Circle–Octagoncombination is that both figures have been carefully and skilfully constructedfrom the same fundamental length.28 [part0051.html#note777]This unit of measure, now known by the unfortunate yet strangely appropriateacronym OCD (for Observatory Circle Diameter), was also deployed at High Bank,which, as Hively and Horn remind us, is “the only other circle-octagoncombination known to have been constructed by the Hopewell.”29[part0051.html#note778] It cannot be a coincidence, then, that High Bank turnsout to conform to a geometric pattern based on a fundamental length of 0.998OCD.30 [part0051.html#note779]Nor is the connection between these two sites limited to their shared unit ofmeasure.Perhaps most striking of all is the fact, noted by archaeologist Bradley Lepper,that “the main axis of High Bank Works—that is, a line projected through thecenter of the Circle and the Octagon—bears a direct relationship to the axis ofNewark’s Observatory Circle and Octagon. Although built more than 60 milesapart, the axis of High Bank Works is oriented at precisely 90 degrees to thatof Newark earthworks. This suggests a deliberate attempt to link these sitesthrough geometry and astronomy.”31 [part0051.html#note780]In my view it more than merely “suggests!” Given that these are the only twosites in North America with circle-octagon combination earthworks, given thatthe circles are 99.8 percent identical in size, and given their precise90-degree orientation to one another, a quite remarkable feat of surveyingacross a great span of country, I think we can safely say that the designers didintend a deliberate connection here. Lepper himself makes a strong case thatthis connection might have been more than symbolic when he presents evidence forthe former existence of a causewayed road with some stretches of its parallelwalls still in place as late as the mid-nineteenth century. He calls it “theGreat Hopewell Road” and speculates that it was perhaps a pilgrim route thatonce ran between Newark and High Bank.32 [part0051.html#note781]As at Newark, a circle-octagon combination forms the dominant glyph at HighBank, and there are adjacent figures and causewayed avenues. When Squier andDavis surveyed the site in the nineteenth century (there has been massivedestruction since) they reported that the walls of the High Bank Octagon were“very bold; and where they have been least subjected to cultivation are betweeneleven and twelve feet in height, by about fifty feet base. The wall of thecircle is much less, nowhere measuring over four or five feet in altitude.”33[part0051.html#note782] Despite its once “bold” walls, the High Bank Octagon,enclosing 18 acres,34 [part0051.html#note783] is a much smaller figure than theNewark Octagon, which, as we’ve seen, encloses 50 acres.35[part0051.html#note784]Why, since otherwise the circle-octagon motifs of the two sites are so similar,since their circles are of identical size, and since it seems theearthwork-makers did nothing by chance, should there be this marked reduction inscale of the High Bank Octagon?The answer, as we shall see, has to do with eerily precise, indeed scientific,observations of the moon.Image Missing [../images/00092.jpeg]Extreme rise and set points of the moon over its 18.6-year cycle as viewed fromNewark, Ohio. When the moon is at a position for maximum extremes, the extremenorth and south moonrises and moonsets in a given month are separated by 77degrees; at the position for minimum extremes, the extreme moonrises andmoonsets are separated by 49 degrees.SKY KNOWLEDGELIKE OTHER SACRED SITES SCATTERED around the world, the geometrical mounds andearthworks of North America don’t give up their secrets easily. They have waysof grabbing your attention but they’re going to force you to do some work beforethey allow you to understand them. Thus, for example, getting to grips properlywith Serpent Mound requires knowledge of what a solstice is and of how therising and setting points of the sun change according to a predictable cyclethroughout the year.Such knowledge, archaeologists argue, would have had immediate utility in thepre-industrial world, reminding farmers, in the words of Ecclesiastes, that for“every thing there is a season … a time to plant and a time to pluck that whichis planted.”As a motive for the memorialization of solstitial and equinoctial alignments,however, the arguments in favor of a practical immediate agricultural payoffdon’t adequately account for the enormous effort involved in the construction ofmany of the sites. After all, the same calendrical functions could have beenrealized almost as effectively and much less expensively with pairs of alignedpoles.The notion that a reliable agricultural calendar was the primary motive forskywatching also fails to explain why we find the same focus on the rising andsetting sun on the solstices and the equinoxes in distinctly pre-agriculturalsites such as Painel do Pilão in the Amazon, dating back more than 13,000years.36 [part0051.html#note785]Likewise, though they can only have been the product of detailed observations ofthe heavens and would have required meticulous record-keeping over manygenerations, the lunar alignments manifested in the great earthworks at Newarkand High Bank have no obvious practical function in terms of harvests—or,indeed, of any other utilitarian pursuit. Once again, though, what they dorequire of those who seek deeper knowledge of them is a study of the heavens.Nothing beats direct observation of the sky over the course of the year—exceptobserving it over the course of many years—but these days excellent freeastronomical software can speed up and simplify the learning task by showing usthe exact rising points of the sun and the moon at any location and over anyinterval we choose.If we make use of such software to observe the behavior of the moon over, say, aperiod of a century, we will quickly notice that its rising and setting pointsalong the eastern and western horizons are locked to a cycle shifting fromfarthest north to farthest south and back to farthest north again every month.As more time passes, however, we will also observe that these monthly“boundaries” on the moon’s rising and setting points aren’t fixed from year toyear but instead widen and narrow over an 18.6-year cycle. If they are at theirwidest (“Maximum Extreme”) today, then they will be at their narrowest (“MinimumExtreme) in 9.3 years and at their widest again 9.3 years after that.Eight prominent directions are therefore implicated in these celestial events.Four target the maximum and minimum monthly boundaries north of east and themaximum and minimum monthly boundaries south of east between which the moon canrise during its 18.6-year cycle. The other four do the same for moonset on thewestern horizon. On each occasion as it reaches one of its extremes the moon’sconstant motion stops—literally comes to a standstill—before it reverses thedirection of its oscillation for the next 9.3 years.The geometry of the Newark Earthworks—and of High Bank, too—turns out to be veryclosely fitted to these obscure celestial events, known to astronomers as “lunarstandstills,” knowledge of which would appear to have no practical contributionto make to the necessities of everyday life.NEWARK’S LUNAR CODEIT’S LARGELY THANKS TO RAY Hively and Robert Horn that we know of these lunarconnections at all.When they began work at Newark in 1975 their purpose was to conduct “a fieldexercise in data collection and analysis for an undergraduate interdisciplinarycourse.”37 [part0051.html#note786] Although cosmology and the astronomicalknowledge of prehistoric and ancient cultures were within the scope of thecourse, they make clear that they “did not expect to find any particulargeometrical or astronomical pattern” at Newark.38 [part0051.html#note787]“Indeed, given the difficulty of showing that any such pattern was intentionalrather than fortuitous, we doubted any persuasive hypothesis regarding design ofthe earthworks could be formed.”39 [part0051.html#note788]To their surprise, however, as they admitted in 2016:Our continued analysis … has revealed repetitive patterns of earthwork andtopographical features oriented or aligned to the extreme rise and set points ofboth the sun and the moon on the horizon. These alignments, combined with themassive scale, geometrical symmetry and regularity of the earthen enclosuressuggest that the Newark Earthworks were built to record, celebrate, and connectwith celestial actors or large-scale forces that appear to govern relationsamong earth, sky and the human mind.40 [part0051.html#note789]In their initial study, published in the journal Archaeoastronomy in 1982,41[part0051.html#note790] Hively and Horn did not recognize any solar alignmentsat Newark.42 [part0051.html#note791] What grabbed their attention instead wasthe intricate cat’s cradle of lunar alignments uncovered by their detectivework.43 [part0051.html#note792]Some were obvious, indeed unmissable once the lunar concerns of the site wereadmitted—for example, the fact that “the avenue axis of the Octagon points tothe maximum northern extreme rising point of the moon with an error of 0.2o.”44[part0051.html#note793]Such an “error,” amounting to less than two-tenths of a single degree,represents remarkable precision for any epoch and far exceeds the level ofscience generally assumed by archaeologists to have existed in the pre-ColumbianAmericas. Moreover, “the avenue axis and four sides of the Octagon mark five ofthe eight extreme lunar rise-set points with a mean accuracy of 0.5o.”45[part0051.html#note794]The three remaining alignments, accurate to within 0.4 degrees, 0.7 degrees, and0.8 degrees, respectively, are also shown in the diagram following.Image Missing [../images/00093.jpeg]RIGHT: The eight key stations of the 18.6-year lunar-standstill cycle at Newark.The central axis and four walls target, respectively: (1) maximum northernmoonrise; (2) maximum northern moonset; (3) minimum northern moonrise; (4)minimum southern moonset; and (5) maximum southern moonrise. The three remainingalignments identified by Hively and Horn are (6) maximum southern moonset; (7)minimum northern moonset; and (8) minimum southern moonrise. TOP LEFT:Simulation of maximum northern moonrise at Newark, as viewed along theObservatory Circle–Octagon axis.Hively and Horn reinforce their case with another observation. The four sides ofthe Newark Octagon that are not aligned to significant lunar events form closelyparallel pairs and are highly symmetrical. By contrast the four sides that doalign to lunar standstills are neither parallel nor symmetrical. The obviousdeduction to be made from this is that the geometrical symmetry of the Octagonwas deliberately distorted to achieve more accurate lunar alignments.46[part0051.html#note795] Moreover,the requirements of (1) octagonal symmetry and of (2) alignment with lunarextrema uniquely define the Newark Octagon. Of the infinity of possible octagonswhich could have been constructed at this site, the one we find is precisely theone which matches the lunar extrema most closely. In fact we have been unable todesign an equilateral polygon with eight or fewer sides which incorporates thesame lunar points more efficiently and accurately than does the NewarkOctagon.47 [part0051.html#note796]Image Missing [../images/00094.jpeg]In the High Bank Octagon wall 11 → 1 is 16 percent longer than wall 10 → 11,displacing vertex 11 from its ideal position in such a way as to produce a lunaralignment, targeting the minimum southern moonrise between vertices 11 and 5.Likewise, there is no gap at the position of the ideal vertex at position 12.Instead the gap has been moved northward to position 9. A line between points 4and 9 aligns with the minimum southern moonset. A further alignment, madepossible by deviations in linearity, targets the maximum northern moonset atmaximum standstill.SUN AND MOON AT HIGH BANKTHE GREAT CONTRIBUTION OF HIVELY and Horn’s 1982 paper in Archaeoastronomy wasthat it demonstrated how precisely, and how cleverly, Newark celebrates andembraces the lunar standstills. In a follow-up paper published in the samejournal in 1984, the same investigators go on to prove that the High Bankstructures embody equally unequivocal alignments to the extreme north and southrise points of the moon.48 [part0051.html#note797] And just as at Newark, wheredeliberate asymmetries were introduced into the side lengths and angles of theOctagon to achieve more perfect lunar alignments, so, too, we find that one ofthe eight walls of High Bank’s octagon is 16 percent longer than it “should” beto preserve perfect geometrical symmetry. This “error,” however, alters theangle to the neighboring vertex, thus opening up an alignment to the southernextreme moonrise at minimum standstill within a margin of just 0.6 degrees. Ifthe wall had been the “correct” symmetrical length no lunar alignment would havebeen possible.49 [part0051.html#note798] A second such “error” facilitates analignment with the southern extreme moonset, again at minimum standstill.50[part0051.html#note799]Image Missing [../images/00095.jpeg]Targeting of the northern extreme moonrise and the southern extreme moonset atHigh Bank—both at maximum standstill. In addition, the summer solstice sunriseis targeted within 0.5 degrees by wall 1 → 2 while the alignment 13 → 2 targetsthe winter solstice sunrise.A further alignment, in this case made possible by deviations in linearity,targets the northern extreme moonset at maximum standstill.Clearly, therefore, High Bank and Newark have much in common and in some waysseem almost like twins. Why then, as we asked earlier, does the octagon of oneof these “twins” enclose 50 acres while the octagon of the other encloses just18 acres?The answer offered by Hively and Horn is that not only does the 50-acre Newarkoctagon match the lunar extrema more closely than any other possible octagon,but also that it was designed to do so within the specific latitudeband—measuring 44.5 kilometers from north to south—in which Newark is located.51[part0051.html#note800] In other words, the purpose of accurately aligning theearthwork to the lunar standstills would not have been served if the Newarkoctagon, like the circle, had been reproduced with an exact duplicate at HighBank more than 90 kilometers to the south.52 [part0051.html#note801] The 18-acrefigure with different vertex angles that we find at High Bank is perfectlysuited to the task at High Bank’s latitude.Among other differences between the two sites, perhaps the most notable is thatno alignment to any significant solar event, whether to the equinoxes, or to thesolstices, or to the so-called cross-quarter days in between, has yet beensatisfactorily identified at Newark in the earthworks themselves.53[part0051.html#note802]But there’s a context to this.Recent research by Hively and Horn has raised the intriguing possibility thatthe very reason Newark’s earthworks are where they are is that four prominent“high-elevation overlooks” in the surrounding landscape serve as natural frontand back sights targeting sunrise and sunset on the winter and summersolstices.54 [part0051.html#note803] It’s unlikely to be an accident that thepoint of intersection of these natural alignments “lies in the central region ofthe earthworks and is equidistant (within 2 percent) from the centers of theObservatory Circle and the Great Circle.”55 [part0051.html#note804]Just as with its latitude, therefore, though the matter cannot be proved, thechoice of Newark’s natural setting feels designed and deliberate.Meanwhile, at High Bank, Hively and Horn’s 1984 study not only confirmed keylunar alignments to southern extreme moonrise, southern extreme moonset, andnorthern extreme moonset, as we’ve seen, but also to the northern extrememoonrise and to the southern extreme moonset—both at maximum standstill. Inaddition, the summer solstice sunrise is targeted within 0.5 degrees by wall 1 →2 while the alignment 13 → 2 targets the winter solstice sunrise56[part0051.html#note805]—the same familiar memes of cosmic mystery and geometricmagic that manifest in earlier sites such as Serpent Mound and later sites suchas Cahokia.We’ve seen that these memes can be traced in the Amazon at least as far back asPainel do Pilão some 13,000 years ago.Before Cahokia, before Newark and High Bank, before Serpent Mound, how far backcan we follow their trail in North America?"},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00096.jpeg]THE POVERTY POINT TIME MACHINEDEAR READER, I DO NOT propose to take you on a tour of every mound and earthworksite in the United States, nor even of every mound or earthwork site I’vevisited personally. But if you were to rent a car in New Orleans and drive the800 or so miles north through the Mississippi Valley as far as Cincinnati or alittle farther, with time on your hands for some significant side trips east andwest, you could plan an interesting journey. Despite the wanton destructionduring the past 200 years, some outstanding sites have been saved in Louisiana,1[part0051.html#note806] Mississippi,2 [part0051.html#note807] Alabama,3[part0051.html#note808] Tennessee,4 [part0051.html#note809] Illinois,5[part0051.html#note810] and Ohio,6 [part0051.html#note811] and there are alsosignificant sites in Florida,7 [part0051.html#note812] Georgia,8[part0051.html#note813] Texas,9 [part0051.html#note814] Arkansas,10[part0051.html#note815] Kentucky,11 [part0051.html#note816] and Indiana.12[part0051.html#note817] Other states have mounds and earthworks, too. But inantiquity the North American mound-building phenomenon was centered on theMississippi River, and on its great Ohio and Missouri tributaries, and this isreflected in the distribution of the surviving sites today.A number of different “mound-building cultures” have been identified byarchaeologists, who have assembled them into categories based on period,location, types of pottery, types of tools, arts and crafts, and other criteria.We’ve already met some of the leading lights in this typology, such as the“Adena” (roughly 1000 BC to 200 BC), presently thought to have been the buildersof Serpent Mound, the “Hopewell” (roughly 200 BC to AD 500), who wereresponsible for Newark and High Bank, and the “Mississippians” (roughly AD 800to 1600), who built Cahokia.Archaeologists make routine use of all these labels but also interpolate themwith others that filter out of the classroom and into general consciousness,causing confusion all around. Thus, for example, you will not go far in learningabout the mound-builders without encountering references to the Woodland Period,which is in turn divided into Early Woodland (1000 BC to 200 BC), MiddleWoodland (200 BC to AD 600–800) and Late Woodland (AD 400 to AD 900–1000).13[part0051.html#note818] Allowing for some oversimplification of a complicatedpicture, the Adena culture built its mounds and earthworks during the EarlyWoodland period. The Hopewell culture built its mounds and earthworks during theMiddle Woodland period. The Coles Creek culture was prominent during the LateWoodland period. The Late Woodland period in turn overlaps with the EarlyMississippian period.But these are no more than artificial constructs that help tidy-mindedarchaeologists preserve a sense of order and control over otherwise dangerouslyunruly data—and, besides, we must question how much the types of utensils andtools used by a culture actually tell us anything of value. We wouldn’t expectto gather crucial information about modern cultures from their knives, forks,hammers, and screwdrivers, so why should we suddenly set different standardswhen we try to understand the ancient world?Undoubtedly many different Native American cultures, speaking many differentlanguages, were involved in the construction of the mounds. Undoubtedly theirarts and crafts and tools and pottery differed. Undoubtedly they expressedthemselves in many different ways. Yet when it came to their earthworks, forsome mysterious reason, they all did the same things, in the same ways,repeatedly reiterating the same memes linking great geometrical complexes on theground to events in the sky.It represents a catastrophic loss of memory for our species, something akin to amadman smashing his own brains out, that there was such wholesale destruction ofthe Native American earthworks during the rapid growth of the United States inthe nineteenth and twentieth centuries. To give credit where credit is due, itis entirely because of the excellent, dedicated, meticulous surgery ofarchaeologists that anything has been salvaged from the wreck at all—and as itturns out, quite a lot has been salvaged.In consequence, whether we are viewing the handiwork of the Adena, such asSerpent Mound, or of the Hopewell, such as Newark and High Bank, or of theMississippians, such as Cahokia, no sentient person can doubt the prodigiousscale of this Native American achievement. There can be no doubt either thatgeometers and astronomers were in every case central to the enterprise. Nor isthere doubt about when the enterprise came to an end—around AD 1600 in yetanother catastrophic consequence of the European conquest of North America.But when did it begin?DEFYING EXPECTATIONSI’M OUT NEAR THE WESTERN edge of Poverty Point, a very mysterious archaeologicalsite in northeast Louisiana, climbing the second biggest earthwork mound inNorth America. Built around 1430 BC,14 [part0051.html#note819] a century beforethe pharaoh Tutankhamun took the throne in ancient Egypt, it’s often referred toas “Bird Mound,” because of a supposed resemblance to a bird with outstretchedwings flying east. Slumped and ruined in places, it does have something of thatappearance today, particularly when viewed from the air, but an archaeologicalreconstruction of how the entire mound would have looked in antiquity does notsupport the bird interpretation. More prosaically and more usually, therefore,it’s known simply as Mound A.It reaches 72 feet in height.15 [part0051.html#note820] Monks Mound at Cahokia,500 miles to the north, is taller by 28 feet, and also more massive, but 2,500years younger and the work of a settled agricultural civilization. Mound A, onthe other hand, was made by hunter-gatherers,16 [part0051.html#note821] as wasthe entire Poverty Point complex, where the oldest element of the site, Mound B,has been dated as early as 1740 BC.17 [part0051.html#note822]The sides of Mound A at its base measure 710 feet east to west and 660 feetnorth to south (as compared to 720 feet east to west and 910 feet north to southfor Monks Mound). Mound A’s volume is estimated at 8.4 million cubic feet, anumber hard to visualize, but Diana Greenlee, station archaeologist at PovertyPoint, offers a good analogy. “Take a standard American football field,” shesuggests, “and make it 146 feet tall. It’s that much dirt.”18[part0051.html#note823]Some archaeologists still give credence to the notion that Mound A is anenormous bird effigy since “birds are important within the iconography of NativeAmericans past and present of the southeastern United States.”19[part0051.html#note824] But not so long ago, just as was the case with MonksMound, the experts felt they didn’t need to invoke Native Americans, or indeedany human agency, to explain Mound A. It and Motley Mound (2 kilometers north ofthe Poverty Point complex) were judged to be:Of natural origin, solitary outliers, the only ones for many miles in anydirection, of the geological formations found in the bluffs to the east and thewest of the Mississippi river; islands left by the drainage which cut thepresent river valley. Their appearance would easily deceive someone who was notsomewhat familiar with such deposits.20 [part0051.html#note825]This confident piece of misinformation, put out in 1928 by respectedarchaeologist Gerard Fowke, was among a number of factors that delayed properinvestigation and recognition of Poverty Point. And again, as happened at MonksMound, when the amazing structure could no longer be shrugged off as naturalthere were still many who sought to deny Native Americans the credit for it,attributing it instead to some imaginary group of prehistoric Caucasian settlerswho in the course of time were overrun by “savage” Native Americans.21[part0051.html#note826]All archaeologists now agree that the half dozen mounds and other earthworks atPoverty Point are man-made. All agree likewise that Caucasian settlers (nomatter how appealing the idea continues to prove with the general public) wereNOT in any way involved, and that Native Americans made them. Such disputes anddebates as did occur on the road to reaching these conclusions were more aroundthe level of sophistication of the site, the amount of manpower thoughtnecessary to build it, and the degree of socioeconomic complexity that wouldhave been required to see it through.We’ll not go into detail here, since we’ve seen already that the mainstream viewfor much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was that large-scalemonumental constructions like Mound A at Poverty Point could only have been madeby equally “large-scale, centralised and hierarchical societies” that had “theadministrative means to carry out such achievements and to organise the large,settled populations whose labour is required.”22 [part0051.html#note827]Hunter-gatherers, the prevailing theory proclaimed, could never have generatedsufficient surpluses, nor put the necessary hierarchical organization in place,to make such projects viable. Living from hand to mouth, their concerns wereentirely focused on survival. Productive agricultural societies, by contrast,were wealthy enough to lift the burden of the daily struggle to survive from theshoulders of talented individuals, thus allowing a class ofspecialists—architects, surveyors, engineers, astronomers, and others—to emergeand to master their skills.It was realized from the first archaeological surveys in the 1950s that PovertyPoint was ancient, but it was not initially assumed to be very ancient. Hithertothe oldest mounds in America north of Mexico were thought to be Early Woodland(e.g., Adena) in origin, dating between 1000 BC and 200 BC—although clusteredtoward the latter end of that period. Two initial C-14 dates, explains ProfessorJon L. Gibson of the University of Louisiana, “seemed to indicate that thePoverty Point mounds were not only contemporary with Early Woodland butoverlapped the earliest part of the Middle Woodland Hopewellian mound-buildingperiod.”23 [part0051.html#note828] In consequence, “pushing the mounds back tothe time of Poverty Point was not that drastic a conceptual jump.”24[part0051.html#note829]Indeed, despite being older than any other mounds previously encountered byarchaeologists in North America, the evidence from Poverty Point was acceptedwith relative ease. That it was not the subject of the usual catfights and rivalclaims, Gibson suggests, was in part because of the general assumption of theprofession in the 1950s and 1960s that “mound building, pottery, agriculture,sedentism, and large populations were … an integrated complex. … This all ornothing association … promoted the assumption of an agricultural base forPoverty Point despite the lack of direct evidence.”25 [part0051.html#note830]Nor would direct evidence of agriculture ever be forthcoming, for, as subsequentexcavations have proved, Poverty Point was not the work of agriculturalists, butof hunter-gatherers.26 [part0051.html#note831] This was paradigm-busting in itsway, but archaeologists do hate a busted paradigm, so some wriggle room wasfound. “Planned large-scale earthworks,” commented Science magazine in 1997,“were previously considered to be beyond the leadership and organisationalskills of seasonally mobile hunter-gatherers. Poverty Point was considered theexception, and its extensive trade was cited as evidence for sophisticatedsocioeconomic organisation.”27 [part0051.html#note832]Image Missing [../images/00097.jpeg]Schematic of Poverty Point indicating principal mounds and geometric ridges.The notion that trade rather than agriculture fostered a sufficiently complexand prosperous society to get the mounds built proved satisfactory to mostarchaeologists. The two younger (“Hopewellian”) dates turned up in the initialexcavations subsequently proved to be out of context. No one now disputes thatthe oldest structures at Poverty Point go back to around 1700 BC—fully 1,500years earlier than the first Hopewell earthworks—that the site flourished for600 years, and that it was abandoned and left deserted at around 1100 BC.28[part0051.html#note833]THE WORLD’S LARGEST PREHISTORIC SOLSTICE MARKER?THERE ARE SIX MOUNDS AT Poverty Point, labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F. Of theseMound B is the oldest, perhaps as old as 1740 BC, as we’ve seen. Mound F, whereconstruction began sometime after 1280 BC,29 [part0051.html#note834] is theyoungest. And Mound D (also known as “Sarah’s Mound”) was not the work of thePoverty Point culture at all, but was a much later addition by the Coles Creekculture some time after AD 700.30 [part0051.html#note835]Thus it is the four mounds, A, B, C, and E, that form the key elevations of oldPoverty Point. Mound A looms massively over all of them. Despite its hugepresence, however, it is not the definitive feature of the site, and neither areany of the other mounds. That role is reserved for a complex earthworkconsisting of a series of six concentric ridges, originally up to 9 feet high,forming together a gigantic geometrical figure resembling a half octagon or theletter C, with a diameter of ¾ of a mile. When the lengths of all the ridges areadded together they total almost 7 miles.31 [part0051.html#note836] The ridgecrests are up to 100 feet wide, as are the ditches between the ridges, but theywere much damaged by plowing in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and todayvary from a few inches to at the most about 6 feet in height.32[part0051.html#note837]When archaeology began at Poverty Point in 1952, the ridges were soinsignificant that they went unnoticed for about a year. The late William G.Haag, one of the original excavators, gave a candid account33[part0051.html#note838] of his reaction when he saw them for the first time inaerial photographs shown to him in 1953 by his colleague James Ford—who didn’tinitially reveal where the photographs had been taken:“You know where that site is?” Ford asked.“Well, it’s got to be in the Ohio River Valley,” Haag replied. “No place, exceptthat area in the East where you get complex earthworks like that.”Image Missing [../images/00098.jpeg]Simulation of Poverty Point’s geometric ridge system in its prime.Haag clearly had in mind the geometrical earthworks of Ohio, such as High Bankand Newark, reviewed in the last chapter, but he was in for a surprise.“You’ve walked all over that site,” said Ford.“Not I,” insisted Haag. “I’ve never been to that site.”But then doubt set in, he looked closer and finally exclaimed: “That’s PovertyPoint!”Haag may have been a little slow in recognizing the ridges, but he was decadesahead of everyone else when he joined forces with astronomer Kenneth Brecher34[part0051.html#note839] in 1980 to coauthor a paper in the Bulletin of theAmerican Astronomical Society titled “The Poverty Point Octagon: World’s LargestPrehistoric Solstice Marker.”35 [part0051.html#note840]Haag and Brecher supposed the ridges had once formed a complete octagon but thatthe eastern half had been “washed away.” However:The western half is intact and well-defined. It is intersected in four places bybroad avenues, radiating out from a common center. … The west-northwest andwest-southwest avenues have astronomical azimuths of approximately 299o and 241orespectively, accurately pointing to the summer and winter solstice sunsetdirections at the latitude of the site (32o37' N).36 [part0051.html#note841]Subsequent research proved Haag and Brecher wrong in their assumption that thePoverty Point ridges had originally formed an octagonal shape,37[part0051.html#note842] a matter that anyway has no bearing on their solsticethesis, which depends exclusively on the angles of the avenues in what survivesof the figure today.If they’re right about this, then it would confirm a much deeper lineage for theastronomical and geometrical memes that we’ve followed back in time through theMississippian and Hopewell and Adena earthworks.MASTER PLANIN THE JANUARY 1983 ISSUE of American Antiquity the alignments along the avenuesthat Haag and Brecher had proposed were questioned by Robert Purrington, anastronomer at Tulane University. He agreed that in the epoch of Poverty Point,“the sun would have set, at the solstices, at azimuths of 241o and 299o.”38[part0051.html#note843] He disagreed, however, that these were the azimuths ofthe west-southwest and west-northwest avenues, which he put at 239 degrees and290 degrees, respectively. He concluded that these avenues “very poorly mark thesolstices. … There are no obvious solar alignments.”39 [part0051.html#note844]Haag and Brecher responded in the same issue that the discrepancy between theirazimuths and those of Purrington appeared “to arise mainly from the differencein the location of the center of the earthwork. “Purrington,” they complained,“has located the viewing center at least 100 m to the east-northeast of thecenter we have found.”40 [part0051.html#note845] They repeated their assertionthat “for the latitude of Poverty Point, the summer and winter solstice sunsetazimuths are 241o and 299o, respectively, in good agreement with the orientatonsof the southwest and northwest avenues. Such a solstitial alignment, while notsurprising, seems hard to doubt in the Poverty Point earthwork.”41[part0051.html#note846]Purrington continued to sound like he doubted it, yet in a confusing andself-contradictory manner. In 1989 he published a paper in Archaeoastronomytitled “Poverty Point Revisited: Further Consideration of AstronomicalAlignments.”42 [part0051.html#note847] In it he recalculated the azimuth of thewest-southwest avenue from his previous figure of 239 degrees to a revisedfigure of 240 degrees that, he now stated, gave “an excellent match to thesetting of the sun at the winter solstice (241o).”43 [part0051.html#note848] Hisazimuth for the west-northwest avenue, however, remained the same as before at290 degrees, thus missing “the summer solstice setting azimuth by as much as 9o”and therefore “almost certainly not intended to mark this solar standstill. Thesymmetry of the site then suggests that neither is a solar solsticealignment.”44 [part0051.html#note849] As a final equivocation, however,Purrington conceded that “a counter-argument would take into account the specialimportance attached to the winter solstice standstill by the native AmericanIndians.”45 [part0051.html#note850]There the matter rested until 2006, when archaeologists launched a magneticgradiometer survey at Poverty Point. Completed in 2011, the survey revealed thetraces of no fewer than thirty great circles of wooden posts that had once stoodin the plaza east of the geometric ridges, “some built only inches away from theprevious ones, as if the posts were erected, removed sometime later, moved aslight distance, then rebuilt.”46 [part0051.html#note851]According to archaeologist Diana Greenlee, who was closely involved in allaspects of the investigation, the postholes located were straight-sided andflat-bottomed, nearly 1 meter wide and 2 meters deep, while the circles theyformed varied in diameter from 6 meters to 60 meters.47 [part0051.html#note852]Unfortunately, though, as Greenlee concedes, the project was confined almostexclusively to remote sensing:We didn’t excavate a complete circle, or even a significant arc of one. So thereis a lot we don’t know about the circles. We don’t know how many different kindsof post circles are represented. We don’t know how high the posts were. We don’tknow if there were walls between the posts. We don’t know if they had roofs. Wedon’t know what, if anything, they did inside the circles. We don’t know howmany post circles were visible in the plaza at any one time. Someday I hope toexcavate a larger area of the plaza circles so that we can find answers to thesequestions.48 [part0051.html#note853]One possibility, surely worthy of further investigation, is that what the surveyfound were the archaeological fingerprints of a series of “woodhenges” atPoverty Point. Very much like the Woodhenge at Cahokia—also constantly moved andadjusted, as we saw in chapter 18—they were perhaps used in conjunction withother features to create sight lines that would manifest sky-ground hierophaniesat the solstices and equinoxes.At any rate, even without the circles, the case for significant solar alignmentsat Poverty Point was greatly strengthened when Ohio archaeologist andarchaeoastronomer William Romain, one of the sharpest thinkers in this field,rolled up his sleeves and got involved. His paper on the subject, coauthoredwith Norman L. Davis and published in Louisiana Archaeology in 2011, used newlyacquired Lidar data, and refined archaeoastronomical calculations, to concludethat “Brecher and Haag were right in their assessment more than thirty yearsago—i.e. Poverty Point does incorporate solstice alignments … [and] may indeedbe the world’s largest solstice marker.”49 [part0051.html#note854]The alignments, however, turn out not to be those that Brecher and Haagoriginally proposed. Instead, with the advantage of the new data, Romain andDavis were able to identify two locations “of special importance in the designof Poverty Point.” Referring to these locations as Design Point 1 (DP1) andDesign Point 2 (DP2) they note:Image Missing [../images/00099.jpeg] * Line DP1 to Mound B is aligned to the summer solstice sunset. * Line DP1 to Mound E is aligned to the winter solstice sunset. * Viewed from Mound C, the summer solstice sun will set over Mound B. * Viewed from Mound C, the winter solstice sun will appear to set not over but rather into the side of Mound A. The placement of Mound C … allowed for a long sight line to Mound A, but also resulted in the location for Mound A in a place that seems not-symmetrical with the overall site plan. * A line from DP1 through the central plaza of the site marks the azimuth of the equinox sunset along the northern edge of Mound A.50 [part0051.html#note855]According to Davis, an eyewitness to the latter phenomenon, the sun appears to“roll down the northern edge of Mound A before sinking into the westernhorizon.”51 [part0051.html#note856]Image Missing [../images/00100.jpeg]Poverty Point is “a center place,” Romain and Davis assert, “and also a place ofbalance in the sense that, in addition to the sunset alignments … conceptuallyopposite sunrise alignments are also found.”52 [part0051.html#note857] Thesethey detail as follows: * Viewed from DP2, the summer solstice sun will rise over Mound C. * Viewed from DP2, the winter solstice sun will rise over Mound D. If in fact Mound D was constructed more than 2,000 years after the Poverty Point florescence, then the implication is that the people of the Coles Creek culture understood, incorporated, and further expanded upon the Poverty Point design for their own purposes. * Viewed from DP2, the equinox sun will rise in alignment with DP1.53 [part0051.html#note858]The overall achievement—the “seamless integration of site orientation, celestialalignments, bilateral symmetry of design points, internal geometry [and]regularities in mensuration”54 [part0051.html#note859]—leads Romain and Davis toconclude that “Poverty Point was built according to a preconceived master plan …or design template … that integrated astronomical alignments, geometric shapesand local topography.”55 [part0051.html#note860]In their view, the question that begs to be answered is, “Why? Why was PovertyPoint designed in such a way that it connects geometric earthen forms tocelestial bodies and events at such a massive scale?”56 [part0051.html#note861]It’s an excellent question, but another should be asked first.If there was a “preconceived master plan,” where did it come from?CONTINUITYTHE SOUTHERNMOST OF THE POVERTY Point mounds is Mound E, also known as“Ballcourt Mound.” Just 2.6 kilometers farther south, however, is another mound,once thought to have been part of the Poverty Point complex. Known as LowerJackson Mound, excavations by archaeologists Joe Saunders and Thurman Allen haveestablished that it is in fact extremely ancient—not from the Poverty Point eraaround 1700 BC at all, but from fully 3,000 years earlier, specifically between3955 and 3655 BC.57 [part0051.html#note862]“That Poverty Point builders were aware of ancient mounds is beyond doubt,”comments John Clark, professor of anthropology at Brigham Young University:The entire layout of Greater Poverty Point is calibrated to the position ofLower Jackson, a Middle Archaic mound. All principal measuring grids passthrough Lower Jackson, and calculated space appears to have commenced fromthere.58 [part0051.html#note863]What Jon L. Gibson of the University of Louisiana makes of the same evidence isthat there must have been “an enduring traditional, if not direct ancestral,connection between the Old People and later groups.”59 [part0051.html#note864]This connection, he argues, is “demonstrated by the incorporation of the MiddleArchaic Lower Jackson Mound into the principal earthwork axis at Poverty Point.Actually, Lower Jackson Mound was not merely incorporated—it furnished the alphadatum, the anchor, a vivid case of material or implicit memory.”60[part0051.html#note865]Image Missing [../images/00101.jpeg]William Romain’s Lidar work confirms that Mound E (“Ballcourt Mound”), Mound A,and Mound B are all aligned to true north.Image Missing [../images/00102.jpeg]Lower Jackson Mound, 3,000 years older, is on the same azimuth.The suggestions, made by Clark in 2004 and Gibson in 2006, were followed up in2011 by William Romain. The results of his Lidar survey greatly strengthen thecase that “Poverty Point was intentionally oriented to true north” along “thesightline between Mounds E-A-B and the Lower Jackson Mound.”61[part0051.html#note866]The implications of a connection between the Lower Jackson mound-builders andtheir successors at Poverty Point are intriguing for many reasons.The “intrusive” Mound D, built by the Coles Creek culture at least 1,800 yearsafter Poverty Point was abandoned, and more than 2,000 years after works peakedthere, appears to have been deliberately located to create an alignment to thewinter solstice sunrise. In William Romain’s view, as we’ve seen, this suggeststhat the people of the Coles Creek culture “understood, incorporated, andfurther expanded upon the Poverty Point design.”The suggestion, therefore, is that below the radar of archaeology more than 2millennia of continuously transmitted knowledge connected the Coles Creekculture to the Poverty Point culture.Now, going much further back in time, Gibson proposes continuity across theearlier 2,000-year gap between the builders of Lower Jackson Mound and PovertyPoint.These are long periods of time to maintain any kind of connection, but such afeat is by no means impossible. The Judaic faith, for example, carries down abody of traditions and beliefs that are at least 3,000 years old.62[part0051.html#note867] Hinduism has roots going back to the Indus Valleycivilization more than 5,000 years ago.63 [part0051.html#note868] Both religionsalso create architecture, the design of which is directly influenced by theirbeliefs and traditions.There’s no reason in principle why the same sort of thing should not havehappened in North America. The notion that Lower Jackson Mound and Poverty Pointare each manifestations in different eras of a single system of ideas is theonly way, other than coincidence, to account for the obviously deliberate axialrelationship between the two sites. If the earlier mound had not beensignificant for the later builders, then they surely would not have used it to“anchor” the great enterprise on which they were about to embark.But there’s a problem. In the cases of Hinduism and Judaism we haveunimpeachable evidence of continuity. Through sacred texts, through teachingspassed from one generation to the next, and through cherished and vibranttraditions, there are no broken links in the chain of transmission. NeitherHinduism nor Judaism have ever abruptly vanished from the face of the earth,left zero traces of their presence for millennia, and then equally abruptlyreappeared in full flower.As we’ll see, however, this appears to be exactly what happened in NorthAmerica."},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00103.jpeg]GLIMPSES BEHIND THE VEILTHE REMOTE EPOCH BETWEEN 6,000 AND 5,000 years ago out of which Lower JacksonMound emerges is an important one in the story of civilization. It was towardthe end of this same millennium that the civilizations of ancient Mesopotamiaand ancient Egypt took their first confident steps on the stage of history.They, too, built mounds—for example, Egypt’s predynastic mastabas or the tellsof Uruk-period Mesopotamia. They, too, deployed geometry and astronomicalalignments in the project of sacralizing architectural spaces. And they, too,participated in an extraordinary and seemingly coordinated burst of earlyconstruction—for just like the mounds of ancient Egypt and ancient Mesopotamia,Lower Jackson Mound is not an isolated case but part of what may once have beena very numerous and widespread group of monuments.Just how numerous and widespread we may never hope to know because of thewholesale destruction of thousands of mounds and earthworks across North Americain recent centuries. No doubt most of those ancient monuments, sacrificed to themodern gods of agriculture and industry, were from the more recentperiods—Mississippian, Hopewell, and so on—but chances are that some, andperhaps many, were from the much earlier episode of mound-building dating backto 5,000 years ago and more.From what remains we can begin to gauge the extent of the loss and by 2012,despite the destruction of ancient sites, archaeologists had identified as manyas 97 surviving mounds and earthworks in the Lower Mississippi Valley, withseveral others found as far afield as Florida, thought to be in the range of5,000 years old.1 [part0051.html#note869] Very few of these sites have yet beensubject to radiometric dating, but of the 16 that have, with a combined total of53 mounds and 13 causeways, all are more than 4,700 years old2[part0051.html#note870]—and many are much older than that.As a result, says Joe Saunders, a leading specialist in this field, “theexistence of Middle Archaic mound-building is no longer questioned.”3[part0051.html#note871]Why there should be such a concentration of these archaic sites in the LowerMississippi Valley is unclear. It could be an accident of history—that is,purely by chance more old sites survived destruction in this area thanelsewhere. Or it could be that many more sites were built here in antiquity thanelsewhere and this is why more have survived. Who knows? Perhaps future researchwill reveal very ancient mounds much farther afield in North America. For thepresent, however, the Lower Mississippi Valley is where the action is.It’s unnecessary to describe every site. Indeed only one, Watson Brake, needconcern us in any detail. For the rest, the map and the minimal listing below,substantiated by references for readers who wish to dig deeper, will serve thepurpose.The Banana Bayou Mounds and the so-called LSU Mounds (because they are on thegrounds of Louisiana State University) date to around 2700 BC,4[part0051.html#note872] which, in a global context, makes them about 200 yearsolder than the Great Pyramid of Giza.After that, the mounds of the Lower Mississippi Valley just keep on gettingolder. We’ve already spoken of Lower Jackson Mound (3955 to 3655 BC). Here aresome of the others:Image Missing [../images/00104.jpeg]Ancient Mound Sites of the Lower Mississippi Valley.WATSON BRAKEOne C-14 date suggests that mound-building may have begun as early as 3590 BC;others suggest a range of 3400 to 3300 BC.5 [part0051.html#note873]CANEY MOUNDSC-14 dates range from 3600 to 3000 BC.6 [part0051.html#note874]FRENCHMAN’S BENDC-14 supports a date of 3570 BC.7 [part0051.html#note875] A significantly olderdate of 4610 BC—almost 7,000 years ago—was derived from an excavated hearth.8[part0051.html#note876]HEDGEPETH MOUNDSThe earliest mound date is 4930 BC—again, very close to 7,000 years ago.9[part0051.html#note877]MONTE SANOA charcoal sample from a cremation platform within one of the mounds yielded adate of 4240 BC.10 [part0051.html#note878] Two other charcoal samples from asmall platform mound produced dates of 5030 to 5500 BC11[part0051.html#note879]—moving past 7,000 years ago and toward 7,500 years ago.CONLYEight radiocarbon dates securely locate the site between 7,500 and 8,000 yearsago.12 [part0051.html#note880]THE SITE THAT CHANGED THE GAMEBOTH IN TERMS OF QUANTITY and of quality, Watson Brake has been the subject ofmore thorough, sustained, and wide-ranging scientific scrutiny than any of theother sites that are 5,000 years old or older. Moreover, it is only at WatsonBrake that the excavations and archaeological research have been accompanied bydetailed archaeoastronomical assessments, allowing comparison with the laterAdena, Hopewellian, and Missippian sites reviewed in previous chapters.So it is Watson Brake we’ll focus on here.First, and it is good the reader should harbor no illusions in this regard, nota single item has been excavated at Watson Brake that in any way suggests thepresence of an advanced material culture. The people who built the mounds andlived at the site intermittently—or perhaps more permanently—over a period ofmany hundreds of years used stone tools and points that are typical of theMiddle Archaic period. They were hunter-gatherers, not agriculturalists, andalthough they did gather plants that would later be domesticated, they did notdomesticate these plants themselves. In other words, they lived simply, close tothe earth, and were in every way a normal and representative population for thispart of North America 5,000 or 6,000 years ago.13 [part0051.html#note881]In every way, that is, except one.They built mounds.Referring to the sites listed above (and a handful of others I didn’t list), JoeSaunders writes:The earliest … earthworks in the Lower Mississippi Valley appear to have beenmade by autonomous societies. Practically speaking, it is difficult for 16Middle Archaic mound sites spanning 1,000 years of prehistory in threesubregions of Louisiana … not to look autonomous.But there must have been some communion among the autonomous societies becausethere are too many shared traits that cross the vast expanses of the LowerMississippi Valley, and there is no evidence of other monuments being madeelsewhere. If all Middle Archaic mound sites were spontaneous creations, wouldthey not occur spontaneously elsewhere as well?14 [part0051.html#note882]Sadly, Saunders passed away on September 4, 2017. Formerly regionalarchaeologist and professor of geosciences at the University of Louisiana, hewas the acknowledged expert on Watson Brake and its lead excavator. It was hispaper, “A Mound Complex in Louisiana at 5400–5000 Years Before the Present,”published in Science on September 19, 1997,15 [part0051.html#note883] thateffectively put Watson Brake on the map, preempting arguments that mightotherwise have arisen around the dates of the site with a meticulous,comprehensive, and wide-ranging body of evidence.“There’s just no question about it,” said Jon Gibson at the time. “Saunders hascome at it from too many different angles.”16 [part0051.html#note884]And Vincas Steponaitis of the University of North Carolina commented: “It’s rarethat archaeologists ever find something that so totally changes our picture ofwhat happened in the past, as is true for this case.”17 [part0051.html#note885]Certainly Watson Brake did change the picture archaeologists had of the past,delivering the death blow to the tired old prejudice, already mortally woundedby Poverty Point, that hunter-gatherer societies were somehow constitutionallyincapable of complex large-scale constructions.And as it turns out, despite its low-maintenance material culture, the siteitself is sophisticated and precociously clever.SACRED OVALLIKE SERPENT MOUND, WATSON BRAKE was built on a natural elevation, in this casea terrace dating back to the depths of the Ice Age overlooking the12,000-year-old floodplain of the Ouachita River with its tributary stream theWatson Bayou.18 [part0051.html#note886] And in just the way that Serpent Moundstands above Brush Creek, Watson Brake stands above Watson Bayou,19[part0051.html#note887] creating the illusion that the mounds are 5 or 10 metershigher than they actually are.20 [part0051.html#note888]In the case of Serpent Mound, in front of the effigy’s gaping jaws, the readerwill recall the presence of an earthwork enclosure in the form of a great oval.Although complicated by the integration of mounds into the figure, and on a muchlarger scale, Watson Brake is also an earthwork enclosure forming a distinct andunmistakable oval, with a long axis of 370 meters and a short axis of 280meters.21 [part0051.html#note889]Image Missing [../images/00105.jpeg]LEFT: Watson Brake site plan. RIGHT: 3D model of Watson Brake.There is some disagreement as to whether the total number of mounds at WatsonBrake should be counted as eleven or twelve because one, designated Mound L,requires further archaeological verification. It also lies outside the border ofthe oval formation so firmly demarcated by the other eleven mounds and theirinterconnecting embankments—these latter being in the range of 20 meters wideand about 1 meter high.22 [part0051.html#note890] The plaza contained within theembankments covers an area of 9 hectares (about 22 acres)23[part0051.html#note891] and appears to have been artificially leveled.24[part0051.html#note892] The excavators found it to be almost completely sterileof artifacts or debris, “suggesting its use as ritual space.”25[part0051.html#note893]“Apparently daily activities did not occur in the enclosure,” commentsSaunders.26 [part0051.html#note894] By contrast, however, “daily activities,”suggestive of resident populations, certainly did occur on the wide embankmentssurrounding the enclosure, particularly on the northeastern side.27[part0051.html#note895]In a major study published in American Antiquity in 2005 Saunders reports thatthe initial occupation of the site took place as early as 4000 BC28[part0051.html#note896] and that:The first occupants came to Watson Brake to fish, hunt deer and gather plants inevery season of the year. Prolonged visits probably occurred. … The constructionof the first minor earthworks began around 3500 BC, with Mounds K and B (andpossibly A) followed by midden accumulations where Mounds D and C, and to thesouth I and J, and E were subsequently built. This suggests that the shape ofthe complex was deliberately laid out by 3500 BC. Major building projects thencommenced ca. 3350 BC and existing earthworks may have been heightened andextended along the north mound row. Mound J was erected on the south side ataround 3000 BC. Site occupation was concentrated along the terrace escarpmentbefore construction began and continued after the earthworks were completed.29[part0051.html#note897]The relative “residential stability and autonomy” evidenced at Watson Brake,Saunders concludes, were made possible by “the diversity and abundance ofresources” in the local area.30 [part0051.html#note898]It seems almost superfluous to state, however, that those resources and thestability they promoted could have been exploited efficiently without themounds. Indeed they were exploited for the 500 years when humans were present atthe site who built no mounds at all between 4000 BC and 3500 BC.And then, suddenly … mounds.Why? What could have prompted this colossal architectural enterprise? What wasits purpose?“I know it sounds pretty Zenlike,” Saunders speculated when he was asked thisquestion in 1997, “but maybe the answer is that building them was thepurpose.”31 [part0051.html#note899]TRIANGULATIONMAYBE. BUT I’M TRYING TO envisage how the community leaders or influencers wouldhave sold that to the population. Somehow, “We want you to build these moundsbecause building them will be a good thing for you to do” doesn’t sound like awinning line to me. And when we remember that in the same period mounds andearthworks were also being built at other scattered sites belonging to separate,autonomous communities across the Lower Mississipi Valley, it becomesincreasingly obvious that a powerful and far-reaching social phenomenon musthave been at work.After years of field research, excavations, and on-site measurements, KennethSassman of the Laboratory of Southeastern Archaeology, and Michael Heckenbergerof the University of Florida are convinced that at least three of thesesites—Watson Brake, Caney Mounds, and Frenchman’s Bend—share the same basicdesign:32 [part0051.html#note900]The plan we infer from the spatial arrangement of Archaic mounds consists of aseries of proportional and geometric regularities, including (1) a “terrace”line of three or more earthen mounds oriented along an alluvial terraceescarpment; (2) placement of the largest mound of each complex in theterrace-edge group, typically in a central position; (3) placement of thesecond-largest mound at a distance roughly 1.4 times that between members of theterrace-edge group; (4) a line connecting the largest and second-largest … mound(herein referred to as the “baseline”) set at an angle that deviates roughly 10degrees from a line orthogonal to [i.e., at right angles to] the terrace line;and (5) an equilateral triangle oriented to the baseline that intercepts othermounds of the complex and appears to have formed a basic unit ofproportionality.33 [part0051.html#note901]I won’t attempt to describe Frenchman’s Bend or the several other sites thatSassman and Heckenberger believe may also fit this pattern.34[part0051.html#note902] Watson Brake and Caney can stand for them all. Again along story must be cut short since these two sites tick all the boxes listedabove, but perhaps the most striking outcome of Sassman and Heckenberger’s studyis the clear evidence they’ve produced for a shared geometrical plan involvingthe mounds designated A, E, I, and J at Watson Brake and mounds B, F, E, and Dat Caney.In both cases the line that Sassman and Heckenberger call the “baseline” betweenthe largest and second-largest mounds (A and E at Watson Brake; B and F atCaney) forms one side of an equilateral triangle. In both cases the lines thatform the other two sides of the triangle extend through a second pair of mounds(I and J at Watson Brake; E and D at Caney) before intersecting. And in bothcases a line emanating from the “baseline” evenly bisects the gap between asecond pair of mounds (B and K at Watson Brake; A and C at Caney).35[part0051.html#note903]Image Missing [../images/00106.jpeg]Evidence for a shared geometrical system at Watson Brake (left) and Caney Mounds(right).All equilateral triangles have internal angles of 60 degrees, but why, asksNorman Davis in a review of Sassman and Heckenberger’s findings, “did MiddleArchaic Builders use a 60o triangle? Why not a 45o, or a 65 or a 75otriangle?”36 [part0051.html#note904]The answer to this question, he suggests, has everything to do with the sun:It is probably not a coincidence that at Watson Brake the distance along thehorizon from where the sun rises (or sets) on the winter solstice to where itrises (or sets) on the summer solstice defines an arc of 59 degrees. … Theirtriangle was probably derived from [this].37 [part0051.html#note905]THE DIRECTORSAS AT SERPENT MOUND, AS at Cahokia, as at Newark, as at High Bank, and as atPoverty Point, the primary concern of the designers of Watson Brake seems tohave been to manifest, memorialize, and consummate the marriage of heaven andearth at key moments of the year. This notion of sky/ground communion—summarizedin the Old World in the Hermetic dictum “as above so below” but part of auniversally distributed package of astronomical and geometrical memes—caninvolve the moon and the earth, specific stars or constellations and the earth,other planets and the earth, the Milky Way and the earth, and the sun and theearth.At Watson Brake, it’s the sun and the earth that take center stage, as NormanDavis ably demonstrated in 2012 across 18 pages of the journal LouisianaArchaeology.38 [part0051.html#note906] The principal assertions concerningsolstitial and equinoctial alignments that he makes there have stood the test oftime and won the support of leading archaeoastronomers.39[part0051.html#note907]In brief, Davis includes the twelve recognized mounds, A through L, in hissurvey but he also takes note of two natural mounds “possibly modified”40[part0051.html#note908] that in his view were intentionally left near the centerof the oval in antiquity when the rest of the plaza was artificially leveled.These he designates Mounds 1 and 2.Among his key findings the most immediately striking is that no fewer than fiveseparate alignments running through the site each independently and redundantlytarget the summer solstice sunset. “Even if the alignments were not to the sun,”Davis writes, “the ability to establish five perfectly parallel, nearlyequidistant sightlines across several hundred meters would be remarkable. Thesightlines had to have preceded construction. Their pattern suggests a mastersite plan, with construction to the plan taking years, or perhaps centuries, tocomplete.”41 [part0051.html#note909]Impressively, the alignments target the sun not exactly where it rises and setstoday but rather precisely where it would have risen and where it would have setin the epoch of 3400 BC—which, at the latitude of Watson Brake, was at azimuth119 degrees for the winter solstice sunrise and at azimuth 299 degrees for thesummer solstice sunset.42 [part0051.html#note910] As the reader will recall,solstice alignments are reciprocal. If you are facing the setting sun on thesummer solstice, then 6 months later on the winter solstice the sun will rise inthe exact opposite direction, 180 degrees around the “dial” of the “azimuthclock.”Image Missing [../images/00107.jpeg]The “azimuth” of an object is its distance from true north in degrees countingclockwise. North is nominated as 0 degrees, so azimuth 90 degrees is due east,azimuth 180 degrees is due south, and azimuth 270 degrees is due west. Anazimuth of 299 degrees will therefore be 29 degrees north of west. An azimuth of119 degrees is 29 degrees south of east.There are no alignments to the summer solstice sunrise or to the winter solsticesunset at Watson Brake. But the clear alignments to the summer solstice sunset(azimuth 299 degrees) and the winter solstice sunrise (azimuth 119 degrees)identified by Davis are as follows: * From Mound A to Mound B. * From Mound J to Mound 2. * From Mound D to Mound L. * From Mound I to the southern edge of Mound D. * From Mound E to the outside edge of the double bulge on the Mound E platform.43 [part0051.html#note911]Image Missing [../images/00108.jpeg]“The Mound J to Mound 2 sightline,” Davis adds, “continues on and passes throughthe center of the gap between Mounds C and D. The Mound D to Mound L sightlinepasses through the center of the gap between Mounds I and J. The sightlines haveazimuths of 119 degrees and 299 degrees.”44 [part0051.html#note912]Could Watson Brake’s multiple alignments to the summer solstice sunset and thewinter solstice sunrise have come about by chance? It already seems vanishinglyunlikely, but what settles the matter is that the site’s concerns turn out to benot only with the solstices but also with the spring and autumn equinoxes—thosespecial times of balance around March 21 and September 21 when night and day areof equal length and the sun rises perfectly due east and sets perfectly duewest. Davis has identified four equinoctial alignments at Watson Brake, asfollows: * From Mound A to Mound C. * From Mound 1 to Mound 2. * From Mound E to Mound F. * From Mound G to Mound H.45 [part0051.html#note913]Image Missing [../images/00109.jpeg]In addition, several of these equinox sight lines, notably Mounds E–F and moundsG–H, extend to other mounds and features of the earthwork in such a way, Davisnotes, that their east to west alignment “had to have preceded construction.This suggests that equinox alignments were … used to engineer this site.”46[part0051.html#note914]And not only the equinox alignments.Image Missing [../images/00110.jpeg]The length of the Watson Brake earthworks is defined by the alignment to thesummer solstice sunset of the two ends of its principal axis, Mound L in thesoutheast and Mound D in the northwest. Its breadth is defined on one side bythe Mound E to Mound E-platform alignment, and on the other by the Mound A toMound B alignment, both also solstitial.47 [part0051.html#note915]All in all, Davis makes a strong case that the entire design of the site is anartifact of its solstitial and equinoctial alignments. They came first;everything else followed. The question that remains unanswered, however, is …why? Davis sidesteps it, stating that his purpose is only “to demonstrate thatsolstice and equinox alignments are present at Watson Brake.”48[part0051.html#note916] There’s no doubt he has succeeded in this enterprise, ashis findings regarding the site’s solstice alignments have subsequently beenconfirmed at a higher level of technical precision in a Lidar survey byarchaeoastronomer William Romain.Image Missing [../images/00111.jpeg]Joining earth to sky. All equinox and solstice sight lines at Watson Brake.Image Missing [../images/00112.jpeg]Lidar confirmation and refinement of the solstitial alignments in the Davissurvey by William Romain.Building on the discoveries made by Davis, Romain’s conclusions are striking:Watson Brake incorporates sophisticated geometric designs tied to astronomicalsightlines in multiple ways. As someone who has worked mostly in the field ofHopewell archaeology, I am still trying to wrap my head around the fact that allthis anticipates Adena and Hopewell by thousands of years. Indeed, thesignificance of these findings is that Watson Brake appears to be theearliest-known celestially-aligned mound complex in North America. That’s a bigdeal.49 [part0051.html#note917]The fact that it’s a big deal only makes the unanswered “why” question moreurgent, but Davis admits he’s unable to think of any “practical reason why thesite should have been designed and engineered around solar sightlines. In factit must have added to the difficulty of construction.”50 [part0051.html#note918]The logical conclusion, he suggests, is that “using solar azimuths to design andbuild Watson Brake may have had more to do with cosmology [beliefs about theorigin and nature of the universe] than astronomy [the scientific study of theheavens].”51 [part0051.html#note919]None of the other Middle Archaic sites have yet had the benefit of the sort ofthorough archaeoastronomical survey that Davis, and subsequently Romain, havebeen able to carry out at Watson Break. However, Davis estimates from mapanalysis, within a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percent, that the CaneyMounds site has “one equinox alignment and two summer and winter solsticealignments. Frenchman’s Bend has one equinox alignment and one winter solsticealignment.”52 [part0051.html#note920]The mystery, although the sites so far investigated “show no evidence for thedevelopment of astronomical knowledge over time,”53 [part0051.html#note921] isthat “the people who directed the construction of Watson Brake … had an advancedknowledge of the solar and probably lunar cycles, and they used this knowledgeto design and engineer their sites. Who were these directors, and how did theyget others to build the sites one container of earth at a time?”54[part0051.html#note922]REINCARNATIONSOTHER QUESTIONS SHOULD BE ASKED.How were these “directors” able to manifest geometrical and astronomicalknowledge, and advanced combinations of the two, more than 5,000 years ago whenno prior evidence of the existence of such abilities has been found in NorthAmerica at such an early date? Set aside for a moment the issue of theorganizational competence necessary to motivate and manage the workforce. Thebigger problem is that the scientific skills and the knowledge required tocreate the earthworks just seem to appear out of nowhere, with no evolution andno buildup.One minute they’re not there. The next, almost magically, they are. And then, atonce, the Middle Archaic mound-building phenomenon bursts into full bloom.We know it starts earlier, but for convenience let’s take the florescence ofWatson Brake around 3400 BC as a benchmark.What follows, there and at the other sites, is roughly 700 years of stability,continuity, and—we must assume given the similarities—communications andconnections. As noted earlier, these were all different cultures, but they allshared the same mound-building obsession and continued to express it in the sameways.Until sometime around 2700 BC.That was when, for some unexplained reason, the ancient sites were all abandonedand the whole mound-building enterprise came to an abrupt and complete halt.I’ll let Joe Saunders, the acknowledged expert on the subject, take up the storyof the mysterious end of Middle Archaic mound-building:New radiometric data indicate a sudden and widespread cessation of moundbuilding in northeast Louisiana. The clustering of the ten youngest dates fromseven mounds at four sites is remarkable. The median probability for seven ofthe ten samples falls between 2884 BC and 2739 BC. Equally remarkable is thatthe cessation of mound construction may have lasted up to 1,000 years, or untilthe emergence of the Poverty Point culture. … To date, not one mound site datingto the Late Archaic (2700 BC to 1700 BC) has been identified in the LowerMississippi Valley.55 [part0051.html#note923]Saunders declines to speculate in any depth about the reasons for thisprecipitous end to the precocious early mound-building phenomenon in NorthAmerica. He’s open to the possibility, suggested by some, that climate changemight have been involved, but states his own view that “the ‘synchronous’ eventmay be better understood as a social phenomenon. The abandonment of an ideologyor change in ethos can occur simultaneously within a diverse range ofenvironments. Also the absence of environmental change would be consistent withthe documented continuity in economy from Early to Late Archaic periods—before,during, and after mound building.”56 [part0051.html#note924]Whatever the reason, the facts are not in doubt. Mound-building, with all itssophisticated geometry and astronomy, stopped dead in its tracks around 2700 BC.For the next thousand years not a single mound was built and not a singleearthwork was raised. There’s not a hint of geometry or of monumentalarchitecture. The only reasonable conclusion is that those skills had beenutterly lost.But then, as suddenly and mysteriously as the “mound-building movement” hadvanished, it appeared again, at around 1700 BC, in the spectacular andsophisticated form of Poverty Point.57 [part0051.html#note925] All the oldgeometrical and astronomical skills were redeployed there—and by practicedhands—as though they’d been in regular use all along.Poverty Point thrived for the next 600 or so years, only to be abandoned in itsturn at around 1100 BC. Then it seems that mound-building was interrupted againuntil relatively late in the development of the culture archaeologists call theAdena. The label “Adena” is in fact the name of the country estate in Ohio onwhich the “typesite” was found.58 [part0051.html#note926] We have no idea whatthat culture called itself. Its origins can be traced back to around 1000 BC.59[part0051.html#note927] However, no early Adena mounds exist and those that havebeen dated, such as the Adena Mound typesite,60 [part0051.html#note928] clusteraround 200 BC or, in the case of Serpent Mound, 300 BC,61[part0051.html#note929] but not significantly earlier.62 [part0051.html#note930]It looks very much as if there was another hiatus, perhaps not of 1,000years—let’s say 800 years—between the end of Poverty Point and the rebirth ofthe mound-builder movement late in the Adena period. Thereafter it grew again tofull force in its Hopewell and later Mississippian manifestations until finallybeing brought to an end by the European conquest.Despite the fact that different cultures were involved at different periods,every resurgence of mound-building was linked to the reiteration andreimagination of the same geometrical and astronomical memes.This was not “chance” or “coincidence.”Witness, for example, the way that Lower Jackson Mound was used as the basedatum from which the entire geometry of Poverty Point was calculated.Or, at a more human level, consider the case of the highly polished hematiteplummet—a valuable item—that was made at Poverty Point at around 1500 BC butthat some pilgrim carefully carried to the by then long-abandoned and desertedsite of Watson Brake and deliberately buried half a meter deep near the top ofMound E.63 [part0051.html#note931]This kind of behavior—the incorporation of ancient sites into younger ones,pilgrimage, an offering—has the feel of a religion about it. Religiousinstitutions have proved themselves throughout history to be extremely efficientvehicles for the preservation and transmission of memes across periods ofthousands of years.It’s not unreasonable, therefore, to suppose that some kind of cosmic“sky-ground” religion lay behind the alignments to the solstices and theequinoxes at Watson Brake and at the other early sites—a religion sufficientlyrobust to ensure the continuous successful transmission of a system of geometry,astronomy, and architecture over thousands of years.John Clark is in no doubt. “The evidence,” he says, “suggests very old andwidely disseminated knowledge about how to build large sites. The building lorepersisted remarkably intact for so long that I think we can, and must, assumethat it was part of special knowledge tied to ritual practice.”64[part0051.html#note932]Where did this special knowledge come from before it appeared at Watson Brake?How old is it really?And why, like the serpent that changes its skin or the phoenix reborn from theashes, does it possess the extraordinary ability to vanish for millennia andthen to reappear, as Clark puts it, “with no apparent distortions, loss ofmeasurement accuracy, or shifts in numeration?”65 [part0051.html#note933]If it was carried in religious ritual among the ancient civilizations of theMississippi Valley, then perhaps there will be clues to its origins, and itspurpose, in what survives of the spiritual ideas of those long-lost people."},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00113.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00114.jpeg]QUIETUS?IN MAY 2017, ON A research trip for this book across the American Southwest, Iawoke in my hotel room in the small town of Bloomfield, New Mexico. It was deepin the night and very dark. I felt nauseous and assumed I’d picked up a stomachbug somewhere along the way. I didn’t imagine it was anything serious. Iremember getting out of bed without disturbing Santha, who was sleeping deeplyafter a long day of photography in the sun. I found my way to the bathroom,switched on the light, and stood hunched over the toilet, waiting to throw up.The next thing I knew I was returning to consciousness, deeply confused, wiredto a drip and lying in a hospital bed. It was full daylight and Santha wasstanding over me, looking scared.“Where am I?” I asked. My voice sounded slurred, my tongue thick in my mouth. Ihad difficulty forming words. “What the fuck happened?”“You had a seizure, my love,” Santha replied, “but they say you’re going to beokay.”The hospital was the San Juan Regional Medical Center in Farmington, New Mexico,about 15 miles west of Bloomfield. I recall nothing of the paramedics coming, orthe ambulance journey, or what happened in the emergency room. What I do know,because Santha subsequently told me, is that at around 3:30 am she had awakened,sensed my absence, seen that the light was on in the bathroom, and called myname. I didn’t answer so she called again, and when there was still no reply shehurried from the bed to find me lying on the floor, half in the bathroom andhalf out of it, writhing uncontrollably with powerful muscular convulsions andblood pouring from my mouth where I’d bitten my tongue.After turning me on my side to stop me from choking, Santha called 911 and wokeour traveling companions, Randall Carlson and Bradley Young, who were staying inneighboring rooms.I remember none of this. It seems, however, that I’d been stabilized in the ERand then transferred to the bed where I regained consciousness and quite rapidlybegan to get my wits back. That evening I was discharged and was able to returnto our hotel in Bloomfield, where I read my medical notes. It turned out I wassuffering from a previously undetected heart condition known as atrialfibrillation and was now to take anticoagulant medication daily to prevent apossible recurrence of what was diagnosed as a transient ischemic attack—inother words, a “mini stroke.” I suffered some loss of memory of events that hadtaken place in the weeks before the attack but there was no obvious neurologicaldamage visible on the scans. The medical staff at Farmington were absolutelybrilliant. I’m deeply grateful for their rapid and effective intervention.I do indeed have atrial fibrillation, which can and does cause strokes (theblood pools and clots in the heart). I’m still taking anticoagulants. However,the diagnosis I’d been given was very far from complete, as became clear aroundnoon on Monday, August 14, 2017, when I suffered further, far more severe,seizures at my home in Bath, England.Again I was rushed to the emergency room and then to the ICU. Again the medicalstaff, now at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, were completely brilliant,caring, and engaged with my case far above and beyond the call of duty. Thistime the convulsions racking my body were exceptionally violent and continuousand Santha was taken aside by the neurologist who advised her she must prepareherself for the worst. The medical team was having no success in stopping theseizures and it was possible I would die or end up so badly brain damaged that Iwould effectively be a vegetable.As a last resort I was put into an induced coma, intubated on a ventilator. Mycondition settled over the next 48 hours and eventually the doctors were able towithdraw the tube and start me breathing for myself again. It was the evening ofWednesday, August 16, when I began to return to some form of consciousness,baffled to see that Sean and Shanti, two of my grown-up children, had flown fromLos Angeles and New York to be with Santha at my bedside, together with Leilaand Gabrielle, two more of our grown-up children, who live in London. For quitesome time I couldn’t understand what had happened, why I’d been fitted with acatheter, why my brain was so foggy.Little by little consciousness increased. I was moved to the neurology ward andon Thursday night, August 17, much to my relief, the catheter was removed. Allday Friday the 18th I remained in the neurology ward, very wobbly but able tototter to the toilet with the aid of a stick. By Friday night I was feeling muchbetter. Finally, on Saturday, I was discharged and came home.Tests carried out established pretty clearly (although there is still somemystery over what exactly is going on) that the epileptic seizures were notcaused by blood clots deriving from my atrial fibrillation, but rather bylong-term overuse of a migraine medication called sumatriptan, delivered byinjection; I was taking up to a dozen of these shots a month and had been doingso for more than 20 years. Turns out having migraines is itself a risk factorfor epilepsy, and research has established a link between triptans (especiallywhen overused) and seizures. It’s almost certain it was the sumatriptan that hadbrought me to death’s door, and it is now obvious that I must simply suffer thehideous and mind-numbing pain of my migraines or end up comatose or dead. As Iwrite this in 2018 I’m still on massive daily doses of the anticonvulsantmedication levetiracetam. As long as I keep on taking it there’s a good chancethe condition won’t recur.OUT OF BODYTHE 48 HOURS OF INDUCED coma, though utterly harrowing for Santha, for ourchildren, and for myself, raised interesting questions. Where was “I” duringthese missing 48 hours? I do remember the ventilator tube being stuffed down mythroat and the powerful sense that I was being invaded and asphyxiated. But whathappened after that?A few confused recollections return from time to time to haunt me, but they’reso muddled and fragmentary I can’t put them into place. I don’t think they’rememories of near-death experiences because—after all—I wasn’t dead. It wassimply that my consciousness had been switched by medication to standby mode andthe more I look back on it the more I realize that I was just absent, just gone,during those 48 hours. If I try to visualize that strange interlude what I seeand what I feel is … darkness.Claustrophobic, enclosed, thick darkness.It wasn’t like that the last time I “died,” which was in May 1968, pretty muchexactly 49 years earlier, following a massive electric shock.I was seventeen then and still living at home with my parents. I’m an onlychild. One of my siblings, a boy, was carried to term but born dead a couple ofyears before I was conceived. My two other siblings, first a girl—Susan—and thena boy—Jimmy—each lived for nearly a year before they died. When my parents wentaway to their holiday cottage that weekend in May 1968 I was home alone.Naturally, I seized the opportunity to throw a party on Saturday night.The house was semidetached with a small garden off a quiet, close-packed street,not an ideal location for 300 rowdy teenagers, loud music, and publicdrunkenness. It turned into an all-night event. The last stragglers didn’t leaveuntil the early afternoon on Sunday and visits from irate neighbors left me inno doubt how fortunate I was that the police had not been called. Certainly myparents would be informed about what had happened when they returned thatevening.In a state of some anxiety I spent the afternoon cleaning up. The house had beentrashed so it took me hours to make it presentable, but by nightfall I was leftonly with the kitchen. I didn’t expect my parents back until late. There wasstill time. So I rolled up my sleeves and started in on the huge pile of dishes,cups, glasses, and empty bottles littered around the sink. A lot of water hadbeen spilled on the floor. I would find a mop and deal with that as soon as thedishes were done.I was barefoot, hands and arms wet, and standing in the water around the base ofthe sink, when it occurred to me to check whether the refrigerator was properlyplugged in. I’m quite obsessive and often push the back of a plug to make sureit is securely in its socket. The plug was close, I knew exactly where itwas—having done this many times before—and without looking I reached for it.What I didn’t realize was that the back of the plug had been smashed off duringthe night and the live terminals were exposed. When I touched them with my wethand while standing in a pool of water there was a tremendous BANG, a hugesearing jolt lashed through my body, and I was thrown across the kitchen,hitting the wall behind me and slumping down to the floor.I knew I was slumped on the floor because I saw my body clearly but from acompletely new perspective. I was no longer “in” that body! I was up around thelight, hovering like a bird, looking down on myself.“Hmm,” I remember thinking, “how interesting.” My body lying there below meseemed a heavy, cumbersome thing now. Quite unnecessary, really. It was no greatloss to be rid of it, and I liked the feeling of lightness and freedom.“What happens next?” I wondered.But then just as suddenly as I’d left my flesh, with just as little choice inthe matter, I was within it again, stirring, groaning, coming back toconsciousness on the floor.I was okay. Just fine, in fact! I’d had a nasty electric shock, that was all.I was young and strong then, and quite soon I was back on my feet. I finishedthe dishes, mopped the kitchen floor, and did a final check of the whole house.Finally, around 10 pm, with my parents still not returned, I took Rusty, myIrish terrier, for a walk. The moon was full and huge in the sky, dimming thestars with its cold, clear light and casting eerie shadows on the ground.Although I don’t remember the exact date in May 1968 on which I waselectrocuted, a quick internet search confirms it could only have been the nightof Sunday, May 12, when the moon was indeed full.My migraines began quite soon after that and have continued ever since. I thinkthere’s a pattern where they occur more frequently around the time of the fullmoon than at other times of the month, but I’ve never bothered to keep adetailed record that would confirm or refute that theory. I could just as easilybe imagining the connection.One thing my near-death experience in 1968 and my experiences of seizure andinduced coma in 2017 have taught me, however—one thing I’m sure of—is that theborderline between life and death is filmy, fragile, and as permeable as abreath of air.We feel firmly fixed in our lives but any of us may cross over at any time.Sometimes, very rarely, we come back.But when we don’t? What happens then? Is that the end of us, or is itpossible—as every religion in the world asserts—that some part of us, someimmaterial essence, survives the grave?A faction of scientists (Richard Dawkins and Daniel Dennett are notablemembers), scoff at the very suggestion that there might be anything more to usthan our material, mortal parts—and they could be right. It may really be thecase that there is no transcendent meaning in the universe, no purpose to thehuman experience, no such thing as the soul, and therefore no possibility of anykind of “life after death.” It’s important to be clear, though, that such ideasare not proven, evidence-based, scientific “facts” arising from experiments andempirical research. On the contrary, they are unproven assumptions and as such,even if voiced by eminent figures like Dawkins and Dennett, they’re of nogreater or lesser value than the unproven assumptions that underlie allreligions.Regardless of one’s own opinions on such matters, moreover, there is oneundeniable fact on which I think everyone can agree, and this is that ancientcivilizations, just like our own, had religions and that these religions, justlike our own, concerned themselves very deeply with the problem of death.REALM OF THE DEADI WAS RAISED IN A Christian family, and being by nature rebellious I committedmyself to atheism at around age fifteen.After that, I think can safely say that I took no interest in spiritual matterswhatsoever until I encountered the Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead in my earlyforties. I was ready for it then, in a way I wouldn’t have been in my twentiesor thirties, and I was so intrigued by its contents that over a period of yearsI also delved extensively, with growing fascination, into the more ancientPyramid Texts and the less well known Coffin Texts, Book of Gates, Book of WhatIs in the Netherworld, and Book of the Breaths of Life.I’ll refer to these texts in what follows sometimes by their specific titles andsometimes, collectively, as the “books of the dead” or as the “funerary texts.”They are the surviving treasures of an ancient and profound inquiry into themysterious nature of reality. I first began to describe what I drew from them inFingerprints of the Gods, published in 1995, and then had the opportunity to gointo greater detail in two subsequent books, Message of the Sphinx (titledKeeper of Genesis in the United Kingdom), published in 1996, and Heaven’sMirror, published in 1998.An enigma that I explore in all those books, but in the greatest detail inHeaven’s Mirror, is that traces of the same spiritual concepts and symbolismthat enlighten the Egyptian texts are found all around the world among culturesthat we can be certain were never in direct contact. Straightforward diffusionfrom one to the other is therefore not the answer, and “coincidence” doesn’teven begin to account for the level of detail in the similarities. The bestexplanation, in my view, is that we’re looking at a legacy, shared worldwide,passed down from a single, remotely ancient source.There are many aspects to this legacy, but I believe its hallmark, as the readerknows by now, is a system of ideas in which geometry, astronomy, and the fate ofthe soul are all strangely entangled. The geometrical and astronomical memes bywhich the system replicates itself across cultures and epochs are plentifullyrepresented in the circles, squares, rectangles, and triangles, and in thesolstitial, equinoctial, and lunar alignments, of the great mounds and geoglyphsof the Amazon and the Mississippi River basins.But what about the fate of the soul?For the entire span of more than 3,000 years that it endured, this question wasthe preeminent focus of the astonishing high civilization of ancient Egypt andof the remarkable religion that seems to have been born fully formed with it inthe Nile Valley in the late fourth millennium BC. Within that religion,expressed in the books of the dead, certain key symbols and ideas stand out,involving most prominently the constellation of Orion, the Milky Way, and thenotion, intimately connected to beliefs about both, that the soul must make aperilous postmortem journey on which it will face challenges and ordeals and bejudged on the choices that it made during life.Image Missing [../images/00115.jpeg]The constellation Orion, on the west bank of the Milky Way, was seen in ancientEgypt as the celestial image of the god Osiris, Lord of the Realm of the Dead. Anarrow shaft cut though the body of the Great Pyramid targets Zeta Orionis, thelowest of the three stars of Orion’s belt. IMAGE: ROBERT BAUVAL.Seemingly with the intention of preparing its initiates for this afterlifejourney, as Robert Bauval and I showed in our coauthored book Message of theSphinx, the funerary texts also called for the construction of large-scalegeometrical and astronomically aligned structures that were to “copy” or imitateon the ground a region of the sky known as the Duat—the ancient Egyptian name,often translated as “Netherworld,” for the realm of the dead.1[part0051.html#note934]The ruler of this Duat realm was the god Osiris, Lord of the Dead, whose figurein the sky was the majestic constellation that the ancient Egyptians calledSahu, and that we know as Orion.2 [part0051.html#note935] It is therefore notsurprising, as a manifestation of this “as above so below” cosmology, that thethree great pyramids of Egypt’s Giza necropolis are laid out on the ground inthe form of the three stars of the belt of Orion. This correlation was firstdiscovered and put on the public record by my dear friend Robert Bauval in hisground-breaking 1994 book The Orion Mystery.3 [part0051.html#note936] As earlyas the mid-1960s, however, Egyptologist Alexander Badawy and astronomer VirginiaTrimble had recognized that a mysterious narrow shaft constructed at an angle ofabout 45 degrees through the body of the Great Pyramid would have pointed at thebelt of Orion at meridian transit some 4,500 years ago.4 [part0051.html#note937]With the use of accurate inclinometer data provided by a robotic exploration in1992, Robert Bauval was able to refine Badawy and Trimble’s work and to confirmthat in the Pyramid Age, circa 2450 BC, the shaft had been precisely targeted onZeta Orionis, the first of the three stars of Orion’s belt, counterpart in thesky of the Great Pyramid on the ground.5 [part0051.html#note938]This, too, makes perfect sense from the perspective of ancient Egyptian beliefs.An invocation often repeated in the Pyramid Texts states of the deceasedpharaoh:O King, you are this great star, the companion of Orion, who traverses the skywith Orion, who navigates the Netherworld with Osiris. … O King, navigate andarrive.6 [part0051.html#note939]Since the shaft emanates from the so-called King’s Chamber of the Great Pyramid,within meters of an empty granite sarcophagus, it’s therefore difficult todisagree with what is now the prevailing scholarly opinion concerning itspurpose—namely that it must have been designed to serve as a portal, a“star-shaft,” through which the soul of the deceased could ascend to Orion andthence begin its navigation of the Duat.7 [part0051.html#note940]ANCIENT EGYPT IN ALABAMA?FOLLOWING MY FIRST BOUT OF seizures in New Mexico in May 2017, Santha and I flewto New Orleans and enjoyed a few days of rest, recreation, and good Cajun foodin one of the most laid-back cities in the world while I recovered my strength.Then we were on the road again, driving north to explore the mound-builder sitesof the Lower Mississippi Valley, heading ultimately for Serpent Mound in Ohio onthe summer solstice.We stopped first about 4 hours north of New Orleans at the incrediblegeometrical and astronomical earthworks of Poverty Point, described in chapter20.We then went on to visit Emerald Mound, also in Louisiana, and the WintervilleMounds in Mississippi, and on the fourth day of our journey reached Moundvillein Alabama.Here, in addition to the geometry and astronomy I’d come to expect, I foundmyself plunged most unexpectedly into an ancient Egyptian déjà vu moment afterwe’d climbed to the top of Mound B. A good vantage point for Santha’sphotography, this mound is pyramidal in form, 18 meters high, and dominates thewhole rather spectacular site that extends southward from the Black WarriorRiver. The expansive grand plaza lay at our feet, edged by more than twentymounds laid out, somewhat like Watson Brake, in the pattern of a great ellipse.At the center of the plaza, presently the focus of Santha’s camera, stood alarge rectangular platform mound—Mound A—and while she photographed it I steppedaside to read the official archaeological marker.Much of what it had to say was standard stuff about the building of the site,most of which apparently had been completed over a period of about 100 years inthe twelfth and thirteenth centuries. There was some predictable speculationthat religion must have been used to coerce, cajole, or convince the populationto do all that work. But then suddenly things got interesting. “At Moundville,”I read,an excellent example of a powerful religious image was the hand and eye motif.Moundville’s “Rattlesnake Disk,” pictured on this noticeboard, offers us thebest-known version, although numerous variations occur in pottery, copper, stoneand shell artifacts.Stories passed down among various tribes tell of the dead entering the afterlifethrough an opening marked by a great warrior’s hand in the sky. One accountdescribes that hand as the constellation we know as Orion with Orion’s belt asthe wrist, its fingers pointing downwards. A faint cluster of stars in thecenter of the palm is a portal to the path of souls or path to the land of thedead. Researchers speculate that the hand and eye represent this constellation.8[part0051.html#note941]I was nonplussed. I try to prepare thoroughly, but it looked like I’d missedsomething important in my background reading before starting out on this trip.The connection of the constellation of Orion to the land of the dead was afundamental aspect of the ancient Egyptian religion and it felt weirdly likecoming home—that comfortable intimacy of familiar territory—to find it here in aNative North American religion.Image Missing [../images/00116.jpeg]Moundville: Rattlesnake Disk with “Hand-and-Eye” symbol. PHOTO: COURTESY OF THEUNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA MUSEUMS, TUSCALOOSA, ALABAMA.But I should have known about this!The Rattlesnake Disk was in the museum we’d passed through briefly on our wayinto the site, intending to see the exhibits properly at the end of our visit.Now suddenly it was top priority, so 10 minutes later we were standing in frontof its display case.It’s a mysterious, complex image on a disk of dark gray sandstone, 32centimeters (just over 12 inches) in diameter. Seventeen notches, creating acoglike effect, are chiseled at equal distances around the perimeter of thedisk. Next, intaglio, come two intertwined rattlesnakes, their long tonguesflicking forward, their bodies knotted together. Curiously, these serpents havehorns. An oval enclosure formed by their coils frames a human hand with whatindeed appears to be an eye engraved at its center.“The hand and eye,” I read in the accompanying description:is a prominent Moundville motif and is thought to represent a part of theconstellation that we identify as Orion. As a group the knotted serpents and thehand and eye are believed to be a representation of the night sky. The serpentsare the ropes that join the earth and sky. In the palm of the hand is the portalor doorway through which the spirits of the dead can ascend the path of souls …a road or ribbon of light, the Milky Way, stretching out before the travelingsouls. This river of light … deposits the souls, after a series of trials, intothe realm of the dead. Families from all over the Moundville chiefdom broughtand buried their dead here because they believed that Moundville was theappropriate place for the spirit to start its journey along the path of souls.Thus over time Moundville became, in the minds of its people, not only thesymbolic gateway to the realm of the dead but also the materialized image ofthat sacred domain on earth.9 [part0051.html#note942]So not only was the constellation of Orion part of the Moundville story, notonly was a journey to the realm of the dead part of it, too, but now I knew alsothat a series of trials would have to be faced on that journey, that the MilkyWay was involved and, last but by no means least, that Moundville itself hadbeen thought of as an image, or copy, of the realm of the dead on earth. Everyone of these were important symbols, concepts, and narratives in the ancientEgyptian funerary texts that I’d been fascinated by for more than 20 years. Itwould be striking to find even two of them together in a remote and unconnectedculture, but for them all to be present in ancient North America in the same waythat they were present in ancient Egypt, and serving the same ends, was asignificant anomaly.In the museum there were other superb examples of the art and iconography ofMoundville. It is all indisputably Native American art, the work of the sameMississippian culture responsible for Cahokia. Every piece on show in thedisplay cases had been produced between about AD 1150 and 1500 when Moundvillewas abandoned, and the archaeologists had done their work so well that therecould be no doubt whatsoever about the dates. This ruled out any possibility ofdirect influence since ancient Egypt breathed its last under Roman occupation inthe fifth century AD, at least 500 years before the Mississippian culture cameinto existence.How, then, to explain the fact that some of the fundamental symbols and ideas ofthe religions practiced at Moundville and in ancient Egypt—ideas and symbolsspecifically concerning the afterlife journey of the soul—appear to be the same?"},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00117.jpeg]THE PORTAL AND THE PATHTHE BOARD AT THE TOP of Mound B said there was “one account” linking theconstellation that we know as Orion to traditions of “a great warrior’s hand inthe sky.” This turned out not to be the case. There are in fact dozens of suchaccounts specifically referencing an ancient Native American constellation inwhich the stars of Orion’s belt form the wrist of this hand—sometimes said tobelong to a great warrior chieftain and sometimes to a malevolent celestialbeing called “Long Arm,” who used it in an attempt to block a portal betweenearth and sky but lost the hand when it was chopped off by a human hero.1[part0051.html#note943]Other than their underestimation of the sheer numbers of such accounts, it tookme no more than an hour on Google to confirm that the information about theMississippian afterlife beliefs displayed at Moundville, though scant, was basedon solid research and accurately reflected the views of leading scholars in thefield.The Milky Way, the connection with Orion, the perilous afterlife journey of thesoul, and the notion of creating an image or copy of the realm of the dead onthe ground were all genuinely present in the Mississippian religion, just asthey were in the ancient Egyptian religion. No one familiar with the PyramidTexts and the Book of the Dead could fail to notice these obvious resemblances.I’m not the first to do so. Andrew Collins and Gregory Little made passingmention of them in 2014 and there was earlier brief recognition of the sameissue by others in 2012.2 [part0051.html#note944] To my knowledge at the time ofthis writing, however, no in-depth comparative study has ever been undertaken todetermine whether there’s a real connection between these two otherwise verydifferent cultures, separated not only by geography but also by time.Is it all just coincidence?Or can coincidence be ruled out?The issue, it seemed to me, was important enough to justify a thoroughinvestigation, and I already had a head start since the ancient Egyptianfunerary texts, though never “easy,” were home turf for me. I’d been throughthem so often while researching previous books that I had no difficulty inreengaging with them. As a bonus I still had hundreds of pages of detailed notesI’d made on all the key recensions over the years and most of those notes, withpage references to the heavily underlined and tagged print editions in myshelves, were in searchable electronic form.The ancient Egyptians left us immense numbers of documents in their beautifulhieroglyphic script and we’ve been able to read them since Champolliondeciphered the Rosetta Stone in the nineteenth century. We also have historicalaccounts of the ancient Egyptians and their religious beliefs written inantiquity by eyewitnesses to their civilization such as Herodotus. So we have alot to go on.In the case of North America, on the other hand, there are no eyewitness reportsto provide a pre-Columbian historical record, and since Native North Americanspossessed no written languages, they left no documents. Even had they done so,if the example of the organized burning of the Mayan codices during the Spanishconquest of Mexico is anything to go by,3 [part0051.html#note945] precious fewof them would remain for us to study today. Such wholesale destruction wasvisited upon the indigenous cultures of North America that it is a miracle anyof their painted and engraved images on pottery, stone, copper, shell, and bonehave survived at all.We can only guess at what has been lost and work with what remains. In thisrespect, as anthropologist Mark Seeman explains, while sites like Watson Brake,Serpent Mound, and even the Hopewell earthworks are so old that “historicalconnections are extremely difficult to make,” it’s quite a different matter withthe Mississippian culture, which is “close enough in time to connect it to thereligious practises and oral traditions of historical groups such as theChickasaw, Creek, Caddo and Osage.”4 [part0051.html#note946]Similar connections with the Lakota, Mandan, Hidatsa, Crow, Arapaho, Oglala, andother Siouan speakers, as well as with the Ojibwa and other speakers ofAlgonquian languages, have added further vital information to the inquiry.5[part0051.html#note947]With these resources at hand, and through a sustained exercise ofinterdisciplinary detective work involving archaeologists, anthropologists, andethnologists, the code of Mississippian ideas and iconography has beencomprehensively broken. The crucial realization, as anthropologists Kent Reillyand James Garber inform us, is that much of the imagery “has a linkage toethnographic material that describes the location of the realm of the dead andthe journey of dead souls to the underworld.”6 [part0051.html#note948]There is “variation in ethnographic details from one tribal group to another, asmight be expected,” adds Professor George Lankford, an internationallyrecognized authority on Native American folklore, anthropology, religiousstudies, and ethnohistory.7 [part0051.html#note949] Nonetheless:There is a unifying metaphor which argues for a common core of belief across theEastern Woodlands and Plains, and probably far beyond that area. That unifyingnotion is an understanding of the Milky Way as the path on which the souls ofthe deceased must walk.8 [part0051.html#note950]Elsewhere Lankford reiterates that this belief system was by no means confinedto the Plains, the Eastern Woodlands, and the Mississippi Valley. It is betterunderstood, he argues, as part of “a widespread religious pattern” found rightacross North America and “more powerful than the tendency towards culturaldiversity.”9 [part0051.html#note951] Indeed, what the evidence suggests is theformer existence of “an ancient North American international religion10[part0051.html#note952] … a common ethnoastronomy … and a common mythology. Sucha multicultural reality hints provocatively at more common knowledge which laybehind the façade of cultural diversity united by international trade networks.One likely possibility of a conceptual realm in which that common knowledgebecame focused is mortuary belief [and] … the symbolism surrounding death.”11[part0051.html#note953]SOULS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIN BOTH ANCIENT NATIVE NORTH America and ancient Egypt the universe was believedto be “layered”—with This World, the everyday material realm, inhabited byhumans, sandwiched between an Underworld below (often with powerful Underwateraspects) and an Upper World, or Sky World, above. In both ancient Native NorthAmerica and ancient Egypt the afterlife journey was envisaged as unfolding inthe Sky World, among the stars. But in both this apparently celestial settinghad contradictory Below World characteristics, including bodies of water andother obstacles to cross, architectural spaces to navigate, and monstrousadversaries to face.Ancient Egyptian notions of the soul can seem extremely complex at first glance.Indeed, according to the great authority on the subject, Sir E. A. Wallis Budge,formerly Keeper of Egyptian Antiquities at the British Museum, it’s not just amatter of one soul but of multiple souls—all of them separate from but in someway connected to the khat, or physical body—“that which is liable to decay.”12[part0051.html#note954]In Budge’s summary, these separate, nonphysical “souls”—perhaps “aspects of thesoul” would be a better description—include notably: * The Ka, or “double,” that stays earthbound after death in the immediate vicinity of the corpse and the tomb. * The Ba, depicted as a bird or human-headed bird that can fly freely “between tomb and underworld.” * The Khaibit, or shadow. * The Khu, or “spiritual soul.” * The Sekhem, or “power.” * The Ren, or “name.” * The Sahu, or “spiritual body,” which formed the habitation of the soul. * The Ab, or heart, “regarded as the center of the spiritual and thinking life. … It typifies everything which the word ‘conscience’ signifies to us.” The heart, and what its owner has imprinted upon it by his or her choices during life, is the specific object of judgment in the Netherworld.13 [part0051.html#note955]Image Missing [../images/00118.jpeg]The Ba soul flying free of the physical remains of the deceased.It would be possible to write an entire book, perhaps several, on thecomplexities of ancient Egyptian soul beliefs. In my opinion, however, once thebaroque flourishes, dramatic elements, and multiple iterations are dispensedwith, the eight “souls” or “soul aspects” listed above can be boiled down totwo, reflecting the ancient Egyptian view of the fundamentally dualistic natureof the human creature as both a spiritual and as a material being.On the one hand, there is that nonphysical, spiritual aspect of ourselves thatis potentially eternal and immortal, aspiring to the “life of millions ofyears,” as the funerary texts put it. Having worn the body like a suit ofclothes, it is this “soul” that is liberated from it at death and can ascend tothe stars, specifically to the constellation of Orion, to begin the next stageof its journey.On the other hand, there is the physical body and the animating force believedto have attended to the vital functions of that body during life. Also seen as akind of “soul,” a supernatural entity in its own right, it is the lot of thisghostly, nonphysical presence—combining most notably the characteristics of theKa (“double”) and of the Khaibit (“shadow”)—to remain on earth with the corpse.Inevitably in such a system of ideas, earth and sky become opposed dualitiessymbolizing the material realm that is to be left behind and the spiritual realmto which the potentially immortal, nonphysical aspect of the deceased ascends.Thus we read in the Pyramid Texts:Earth is this King’s detestation. … This King is bound for the sky.14[part0051.html#note956]The spirit is bound for the sky, the corpse is bound for the earth.15[part0051.html#note957]The King is one of those … beings … who will never fall to the earth from thesky.16 [part0051.html#note958]In a similar vein, with some complexity regarding the activities of the“shadow,” the Book of What Is in the Duat has this to say:Let thy soul be in heaven … let thy shadow penetrate the hidden place, and letthy body be to the earth.17 [part0051.html#note959]Many other examples could be cited but the summary is that the ancient Egyptiansbelieved in two souls, or two fundamental aspects of the soul. One of these (letus not quibble about its several different avatars) remained bound to thephysical remains and the tomb. The other, again in its several forms, was freeto ascend to the sky and begin the journey to the realm of the dead.SOULS OF ANCIENT AMERICAWHAT NOW OF NATIVE NORTH AMERICAN conceptions of the soul?Here, too, we find at first a bewildering multiplicity.The Quileute people of the US northwest coast believe that within every livinghuman body there reside several souls that “look exactly like the living beingand may be taken off or put on in exactly the manner as a snake sheds itsskin.”18 [part0051.html#note960]These souls are an inner soul, called the “main, strong soul,” an outer soul,called the “outside shadow,” a life-soul, referred to as “the being whereby onelives,” and the “ghost” of the living person, “the thing whereby one grows.”19[part0051.html#note961]Let’s note in passing that the Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead declares inchapter 164:I have made for thee a skin, namely a divine soul.20 [part0051.html#note962]Returning to North America, it was believed among the Yuchi of Oklahoma that theindividual “possesses four spirits … one of which, at death, remains on the spotwhere the disembodiment took place, while two others hover in the vicinity oftribesfolk and relatives. … The fourth starts upon a four-days” journey … to thehaven of souls.21 [part0051.html#note963]In other accounts gathered from among the widely spread Ojibwa people ofnortheastern North America, the ethnographer Vernon Kinietz was told that humanshave seven souls—only one of which, “the real soul,” goes to the realm of thedead.22 [part0051.html#note964] Another Ojibwa group reported that, according totheir traditions, the human being consists of three parts:The body (wiyo), which decays after death, the soul (udjitchog), which at deathdeparts for the realm of the dead in the West, and the shadow (udjibbom), whichafter death becomes a grave-ghost.23 [part0051.html#note965]Expressing the same idea in a slightly different way, the Menominee of Wisconsinsay there are two souls in every human being:One, which is called “a shade across,” resides in the head and is the intellect;after death it becomes a grave ghost. The other is the real soul, tcebai, whichhas its seat in the heart and at death betakes itself to the realm of thedead.24 [part0051.html#note966]For the Choctaw, also, humans have two souls—the shilombish, “the outsideshadow,” and the shilup, “the inside shadow,” or ghost, which at death goes tothe land of ghosts. The shilombish remains on earth.25 [part0051.html#note967]And indeed, when the unnecessary details and confusingly ambiguous terminologyare stripped away, it becomes clear that the fundamental Native North Americanbelief across a vast geographical area, like the fundamental belief of theancient Egyptians, was in the existence of two souls, one bound to the body andthe earth, the other free to ascend to the sky. “Soul dualism,” concludesrenowned Swedish anthropologist Ake Hultkrantz in his immense and still widelycited 1953 study, Conceptions of the Soul Among North American Indians,“constituted the predominant type of soul belief in North America.”26[part0051.html#note968]At the heart of this widespread belief system stand twin concepts defined byHultkrantz as the “free-soul” and the “body-soul.” The latter, also sometimesreferred to as the “life soul,” represents “the forces that keep the body vitaland active.” The “free-soul,” on the other hand, represents “the person himselfin his extracorporeal form” but with the added power of limitless movement.27[part0051.html#note969]To what end was this freedom of movement used?Among ancient Native North Americans, as George Lankford explains, it wasbelieved thatat a crucial point in the dying process the “free-soul,” the one that isself-aware and has an identifiable personality in relation to the deceased,separates from the body, leaving behind the life-soul, a mindless force whichcan be dangerous to the living, trapped in or near the physical remains. Thefree-soul remains present in the vicinity for a brief time, then … sets offtowards the west on its final journey. … If at any time along the route thefree-soul gains the power or will to return to earthly life, then it may retraceits steps and re-enter its body. … Mortuary rituals must therefore include atleast two different tasks, taking care of two different souls.”28[part0051.html#note970]Exactly the same care and attention paid to two different “souls,” and for thesame reasons, also characterized ancient Egyptian mortuary rituals.29[part0051.html#note971] It seems clear that these separate ancient Egyptian“souls” are essentially identical to, and interchangeable with, Native Americannotions of the “body-soul” and the “free-soul.”THE ROAD TO THE WESTIN THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN PYRAMID Texts, line 1109, a soul reaches the realm ofthe dead only to hear a voice telling him:Turn about, O you who have not yet come to the number of your days.30[part0051.html#note972]A legend of the Ottawa, a Native American people who lived in Michigan and Ohiobefore migrating to Oklahoma where most members of the tribe are now found,tells of a person who enters the realm of the dead although he himself stilllives. A voice, “as if it were a soft breeze,” whispers in his ear:Go back to the land from whence you came. Your time has not yet come.31[part0051.html#note973]The free-soul can become detached from the body not only in death, but also indreams, visions, and comatose states. From the Native American perspective,“death” has therefore not definitively occurred until there is certainty thatthe absent free-soul will not return. It is for this reason, explains Lankford,that “the ‘dead’ are almost never buried immediately, and most people have aritually specified time of waiting.”32 [part0051.html#note974] The Ojibwa wereparticularly known for their “habit of keeping the dead four days, in the hopethat the soul in the spirit world would return and the person come back tolife.”33 [part0051.html#note975]But when the soul does not return, where has it gone and how did it get there?A legend of the Native American Tachi Yokut people tells of a husband whosedeeply cherished wife had died. Grieving, he went to her grave and dug a holenear it:There he stayed watching, not eating. … After two nights he saw that she cameup, brushed the earth off herself, and started to go to the [land] of thedead.34 [part0051.html#note976]Similarly, in the ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts, lines 747–48, we read thefollowing invocation to the deceased:Arise, remove your earth, shake off your dust, raise yourself that you maytravel in company with the spirits.35 [part0051.html#note977]In ancient Egypt the first stage of the journey to the realm of the dead was toensure that the mortuary rites were properly observed. The purpose of theserites, Wallis Budge explains, was to enable the “disembodied spirit … to passthrough the tomb out into the region which lies immediately to the west of themountain chain on the west bank of the Nile, which we may consider as onemountain and call Manu, or the mountain of the sunset.”36[part0051.html#note978]In the case of the Native American afterlife journey, likewise, as Lankfordsummarizes:The path leads towards the west, the place of the setting sun, the end of theeast-west cosmic passage, the point of transition from day to night.37[part0051.html#note979]Returning to ancient Egypt, it is clear that the first stage of the afterlifejourney unfolds on the earth plane and brings the soul to a special location inthe west, described as beyond “the mountain of sunset.” At this place, Budgecontinues,are gathered together numbers of spirits, all bent on making their way to theabode of the blessed; these are they who have departed from their bodies duringthe day.38 [part0051.html#note980]In Native America, too, a place is reached at the western edge of the“earth-disk” where the dead gather and where they, too, must await the rightmoment, after nightfall, to make the transition from the earth plane to the SkyWorld. “There may be a camping-place for the free-soul,” Lankford tells us:For there may be a wait until conditions are right to continue the journey.39[part0051.html#note981]ORION, THE “LEAP,” AND THE PORTAL IN ANCIENT AMERICAIN ANCIENT EGYPT, THE CONSTELLATION of Orion, located prominently on the westbank of the Milky Way, was seen as the celestial figure of the God Osiris, Lordof the Realm of the Dead, and the funerary texts explicitly and repeatedly urgethe soul to ascend to the sky and unite itself with Orion. A few examples:You shall reach the sky as Orion.40 [part0051.html#note982]May a stairway to the Netherworld be set up for you in the place where Orionis.41 [part0051.html#note983]I have gone upon the ladder with my foot on Orion.42 [part0051.html#note984]The Netherworld has grasped your hand at the place where Orion is.43[part0051.html#note985]May Orion give me his hand.44 [part0051.html#note986]The intention, confirmed in architecture by the star-shaft of the Great Pyramid(see previous chapter) is unmistakable. After completing its westward journey onthe earth plane, and gathering with other souls at a staging point, thespiritual form of the deceased must find a way to gain access to the “placewhere Orion is” from whence the remainder of its journey to the realm of thedead will unfold.But how to get to Orion?The means suggested in the utterances quoted above include a stairway, a ladder,and the “hand” of the constellation itself. Another utterance tells us morevaguely, “There is brought to him a way of ascent to the sky”45[part0051.html#note987] and fifty lines later we read:Here comes the ascender, here comes the ascender! Here comes the climber, herecomes the climber! Here comes he who flew up, here comes he who flew up.46[part0051.html#note988]How was the transition to the Sky World achieved in the Native Americanafterlife journey when the soul had reached the staging point at the edge of theearth-disk? Lankford draws on his vast store of knowledge of the ethnographysurrounding this subject when he tells us that in order to continue its journeyto the realm of the dead:What the free-soul must do … is to make a terrifying leap. The realm of the dead… can only be reached by walking the Path of Souls, the Milky Way, across thenight sky. To get to the path, however, one must leave the earth-disk and enterthe celestial realm. The portal that is appointed for the free-soul at death isto be seen on the edge of the Path of Souls. It is a constellation in the shapeof a hand, and the portal is in its palm.47 [part0051.html#note989]As I learned at Moundville, this Native American “Hand” constellation is noneother than the constellation we know as Orion, with the three prominent beltstars forming the wrist. Beneath these stars, identified as part of Orion’ssword by the Greeks, is a bright sky object known as Messier 42, or the OrionNebula. In the “hand-and-eye” motif it is this nebula, regarded by modernastronomers as a “stellar nursery” where new stars are constantly born,48[part0051.html#note990] that represents the “eye.” Its description as such is,however, a misleading and long outdated label that only remains in use out ofhabit. The truth, as scholars are now agreed, is that in Mississippianiconography it does not represent an eye at all but “a hole in the sky, aportal,”49 [part0051.html#note991] through which the free-soul must pass inorder to reach the realm of the dead.Image Missing [../images/00119.jpeg]LEFT: Native American “Hand” constellation in which the three stars of Orion’sbelt form the wrist. CENTER: Orion’s belt and the Orion Nebula. RIGHT: Anexample of the Moundville “hand-and-eye” motif. The Orion Nebula is representedby the “eye,” and was conceived of as a portal through which the soul must leapon its afterlife journey.George Lankford clarifies the muddle:The hole in the sky is indicated as a slit being pulled apart, and the fact thatit is celestial is frequently elaborated by the inclusion of a star circle ordot. The resulting double sign thus gives the appearance of being an eye, but …it is a coincidental similarity. The “eye” is but a portal with a star at itscenter. The hand-and-eye combination thus indicates the beginning of the spiritjourney, the entry of the soul into the Milky Way at Orion.50[part0051.html#note992]In ancient Egypt the hieroglyphic representation of the Duat Netherworld(likewise accessed via Orion and the Milky Way) made use of exactly the sameconcepts expressed in locally appropriate symbolism. Whereas in Mississippianart it was customary to depict a star in the form of a circle or dot, the starsymbol in ancient Egypt was very much like the five-pointed version we still usetoday. Likewise, in Mississippian art the sky portal was depicted as an aperturein the form of an open slit while in ancient Egypt it was represented by acircle.Image Missing [../images/00120.jpeg]LEFT: ANCIENT EGYPT: The hieroglyph for the Duat Netherworld depicts a hole inthe sky with a star at its center. RIGHT: ANCIENT NATIVE AMERICA: “The hole inthe sky is indicated as a slit being pulled apart, and the fact that it iscelestial is frequently elaborated by the inclusion of a star circle or dot.”ORION, THE “LEAP,” AND THE PORTAL IN ANCIENT EGYPTTHE TOP HALF OF “ORION” above the belt stars is important in the ancientEgyptian Sahu constellation but isn’t part of the “Hand” at all. The storiesbehind the imagery that were told in the Nile Valley and the Mississippi Valleyare also very different. Nonetheless, it’s bizarre that the same constellationplays such a key role in both Native American and ancient Egyptian beliefsconcerning the afterlife journey.Moreover, although ladders and stairs are among the “means of ascent” suggestedto the soul in the ancient Egyptian funerary texts, they are by no means theonly ones. Particularly close to the Native American notion of a “leap” for theportal is Utterance 478 of the Pyramid Texts, line 980, in which the deceasedstates:I leap up to the sky into the presence of the god.51 [part0051.html#note993]Likewise in Utterance 467, lines 890–91, we read:Someone flies up. I fly up from you, O men; I am not for the earth, I am for thesky.52 [part0051.html#note994]And again, almost technologically, in Utterance 261:The King is a flame moving before the wind to the end of the sky.53[part0051.html#note995]Such references, and numerous other examples that could be cited, leave littleroom for misinterpretation. As with the Native Americans, so, too, with theancient Egyptians—a “leap” by one means or another from the earth-plane to Orionwas an essential stage in the afterlife journey.It might be objected that the constellation Sahu/Orion for the ancient Egyptianswas the celestial figure of Osiris, Lord of the Realm of the Dead, and thereforein no way a “portal” in the Native American sense. That, however, does nojustice to the possibility, in so subtle a system as the ancient Egyptianfunerary texts, that symbols might be encoded with multiple levels of meaning. Aclose study of the texts reveals that the passage of the soul through a portalin the sky was indeed a fundamental stage of the ancient Egyptian afterlifejourney.The Pyramid Texts again:Portal of the Abyss, I have come to you; let this be opened to me.54[part0051.html#note996]The doors of the sky are opened for you, the doors of the starry sky are thrownopen for you.55 [part0051.html#note997]The doors of iron which are in the starry sky are thrown open for me, and I gothrough them.56 [part0051.html#note998]Open the gates which are in the Abyss.57 [part0051.html#note999]The aperture of the sky-window is open to you.58 [part0051.html#note1000]The celestial portal to the horizon is open to you.59 [part0051.html#note1001]I am he who opened a door in the sky.60 [part0051.html#note1002]The door of the sky at the horizon opens to you.61 [part0051.html#note1003]“The Orion Nebula,” clarifies Susan Brind Morrow in a new study of the PyramidTexts, “is in the door of the sky.”62 [part0051.html#note1004]And in case there is any remaining doubt, the celestial address of this portalthrough which the deceased must pass in order to enter the Duat Netherworld isalso repeated on multiple occasions in the Pyramid Texts, for example:The Duat has grasped your hand at the place where Orion is.63[part0051.html#note1005]And, as we’ve seen:May a stairway to the Netherworld be set up for you in the place where Orionis.64 [part0051.html#note1006]THE TIMING OF THE “LEAP”FOR THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS, ARRIVAL at the top of the metaphorical “stairway,”the accomplishment of the “leap” to the sky “in the presence of the god,” was tobe timed to coincide with the moment when:Orion is swallowed up by the Duat.65 [part0051.html#note1007]According to R. O. Faulkner, translator of the Pyramid Texts, this occurs when“the stars vanish at dawn.”66 [part0051.html#note1008] More broadly the“swallowing” of Orion by the Duat can be linked to the setting of theconstellation in the west at whichever time of day or night this happens.Let’s now return to George Lankford’s authoritative account of the Mississippianafterlife journey and the soul’s leap to the portal in the Orion Nebula in theconstellation that Native North Americans called the “Hand.” The leap can onlybe attempted when that constellation makes its closest approach to the edge ofthe earth-disk, setting low in the west under the Milky Way just before itvanishes beneath the horizon—the precise moment, for both ancient Egyptians andancient Native Americans, when the door of the sky, “the celestial portal to thehorizon,” was believed to stand open. As Lankford makes clear:The portal in the Hand must be entered by a leap at the optimum time, which is aten-minute window which occurs once each night from November 29, when the Handvanishes … in the West just at dawn, to April 25, when the Hand sinks at dusk,not to be seen again for six months. During that winter period the portal is onthe horizon for a breathless few minutes each night, and the free-souls mustenter at that time or be lost. Free-souls who do not make the transition remainin the West and can eventually become unhappy threats to the realm of theliving.67 [part0051.html#note1009]Image Missing [../images/00121.jpeg]Likewise in ancient Egypt, Budge informs us, it is the fate of those who havenot prepared adequately for the afterlife journey to remain trapped on the earthplane—where their lot, “having failed to present themselves in the Judgment Hallof Osiris,” is an unhappy one.68 [part0051.html#note1010]And in both ancient Egypt and ancient North America it was also believed thatthose souls that had successfully ascended to Orion must then continue theirlong and arduous journey, now transposed from the earth plane to the Sky World.On that journey they would meet monsters and terrors for which it appears thatthe ancient Egyptian books of the dead and the parallel oral and iconographictraditions of the Mississippian civilization were designed to prepare them.69[part0051.html#note1011]Before we explore these further similarities between the supposedly entirelyunconnected religions of the Mississippi and the Nile, let’s reflect in passingon the spiritual system that has evolved in the Amazon rainforest around the useof ayahuasca, the “Vine of the Dead.” The reader will recall that it has thatname because in the “indigenous context” ayahuasca is “intimately related todeath.”70 [part0051.html#note1012] The visions received in the ayahuasca tranceare considered to resemble death and to give foreknowledge of the death processand thus, at the level of experience rather than of study, the “Vine of theDead” appears to be performing the same function as a “Book of the Dead.”Ayahuasca shamans in the Amazon speak of “dying” when they drink the brew. It’sagain suggestive of hidden connections that thereafter, as we saw in chapter 17,they experience “ascent to the Milky Way” in a “single soaring flight” (whichsounds very much like a “leap”) in order to reach the “Otherworld” that lies“beyond the Milky Way.”Sometimes, as they make these journeys, the shamans encounter trials andadversaries that will test them:Terrifying monsters … jaguars and serpents that approach and threaten to devourthe person who, terror stricken, will call out in anguish.71[part0051.html#note1013]TERRORS AND OBSTACLES OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN NETHERWORLDNO ONE IN THE NORTHERN Hemisphere who pays any attention to the sky can fail tonotice the presence of the majestic constellation of Orion during the wintermonths or the fact that it stands at the western side—indeed one could say onthe west bank—of the glowing band of supernal light that is our own disk-shapedgalaxy viewed from within. We call that band of light the Milky Way. To theancient Egyptians it was the “Winding Waterway,”72 [part0051.html#note1014] thegreat celestial river that, as Wallis Budge informs us,flowed through the Duat much as the Nile flowed through Egypt. There wereinhabitants on each of its banks, just as there were human beings on each sideof the Nile.73 [part0051.html#note1015]Moreover, the soul’s leap to Orion was not an end in itself, but simply itsmeans of entry to the Sky World. Once there, it was the Winding Waterway thatwould provide the setting for the next stage of the afterlife journey. “May youtake me and raise me to the Winding Waterway,” as the Pyramid Texts put it.74[part0051.html#note1016]It is therefore intriguing that in ancient North America the Milky Way was mostwidely known as the “Path of Souls,”75 [part0051.html#note1017] and it was onthis path, after passing through the Orion portal, that the spirits of thedeceased found themselves. Lankford takes up the story again:When the free-soul has entered the celestial realm, the Path of Souls stretchesout before it. By most accounts it is a realm much like the earthly one leftbehind, but some describe it as a river of light with free-souls campedalongside. The free-soul must journey down the Path to the realm of the dead.76[part0051.html#note1018]Inevitably, with a great river flowing through it, the Duat “had the shape of avalley.”77 [part0051.html#note1019] However, unlike the Nile Valley, which itotherwise resembled, this ancient Egyptian realm of the dead was “shrouded inthe gloom and darkness of night … a place of fear and horror.”78[part0051.html#note1020]It was, moreover, a place filled with obstacles and fearsome challengesincluding:abysses of darkness, murderous knives, streams of boiling water, foul stenches,fiery serpents, hideous animal-headed monsters and creatures, and cruel,death-dealing beings of various shapes.79 [part0051.html#note1021]A few hours with the vignettes and tomb paintings and you begin to get the idea.The Duat is an utterly eerie parallel universe that is at once a starry“otherworld” and a strange physical domain with narrow passageways and darkenedgalleries and chambers populated by fiends and terrors. There are entities whosework is “to hack souls in pieces.” There are serpents of enormous size, serpentswith legs and feet, serpents with multiple heads, serpents with wings. There areserpents that breathe fire and that are depicted as flooding corridors withfire. There is in particular the monstrous serpent Apep and a speciallydedicated company of nine gods whose work is to slay Apep. There are firepitswhere souls are roasted, in some cases head down. There are bodies of water tocross and “abysmal depths of darkness.” There are torture blocks. There are godsarmed with knives who will kill inadequately prepared souls.80[part0051.html#note1022] And one particularly curious vignette shows “a goddessstanding upright with her hands stretched out to the top of the head of a manwho is kneeling before her, and is cutting open his head with a hatchet.”81[part0051.html#note1023]Image Missing [../images/00122.jpeg]Vignette from the Book of What Is in the Duat. E. A. Wallis Budge offers nodirect translation of the relevant hieroglyphs, merely describing the scenethus: “[A] goddess standing upright with her hands stretched out to the top ofthe head of a man who is kneeling before her, and is cutting open his head witha hatchet.” LEFT: Detail of the vignette. RIGHT: The vignette in context.The vignette82 [part0051.html#note1024] captured my attention for reasons that Iwill explain below. Budge expresses no opinion in his description and since Idon’t read hieroglyphs I couldn’t be sure exactly what was going on. Oneinterpretation that occurred to me was that the goddess was trying to stop thekneeling man from bashing his own brains out. But the scene had an uncanny,rather ominous, quality that suggested a very different possibility. From theway the outstretched arms and hands of the goddess were portrayed it looked moreto me as though she was encouraging him to take that hatchet to his own head—oreven perhaps exerting some kind of divine will to force him to do it.Since there are repeated references to a menacing female figure, usually calledthe “brain-smasher” or the “brain-taker” in accounts of the Native Americanafterlife journey, it occurred to me there was an opportunity here to test themettle of my evolving theory of a deep structural connection between thespiritual systems of ancient Egypt and the ancient Mississippi Valley. All I hadto do was find an Egyptologist to translate the hieroglyphs in the vignette forme. If the translation showed no relationship whatsoever between the goddess inthis vignette and the Native American “brain-smasher,” then my theory would beweakened. If, on the other hand, a clear relationship emerged, then my theorywould be strengthened.Egyptologists in general avoid me, but I was fortunate that Louise Ellis-Barrettat the British Museum was prepared to accept the commission. She was curious asto why I wanted a translation at all but I was determined that this should be aproper blind test, in which no preconceptions were inserted into thetranslator’s mind before she began work, so I declined to tell her.A few weeks later, after investigating the matter thoroughly, Louise came backto me with her translation of the group of hieroglyphs describing the role ofthe goddess in the scene:She lives from the blood of the damnedAnd from what these gods provide herThat Ba-soul who belongs to the damnedThe demolishing one, who cuts the damned to pieces.Image Missing [../images/00123.jpeg]For clarification Louise added that the Book of What Is in the Duat is “dividedinto Hours—each of which is a unit of text and illustration.” The vignetteoccurs in the Fifth Hour of the journey through the Duat (often also referred toas the “Fifth Division of the Duat”) where, as we shall see, the ancientEgyptian judgment scene was also set. Moreover, although the vignette itself isnot a formal part of the judgment, the entire burden of the Fifth Hour, asLouise expressed it in the document she prepared for me, is:its indication of the turning point in life. Here, life will either be renewedor annihilated. The last scene of the upper register [where the vignette islocated] demonstrates the task of the deities whose responsibility isannihilation, the goddess demonstrating how the damned will be dealt with.They will be dealt with, in other words, just as in the ancient Native Americanbelief system, by having their brains smashed out.TERRORS AND OBSTACLES OF THE ANCIENT AMERICAN NETHERWORLDANTHROPOLOGIST AKE HULTKRANTZ NOTES TRADITIONS among the Ojibwa and the Huron ofnortheastern North America concerning:the so-called brain-smasher [who] … deprives travellers to the land of the deadof their brains. … There is in general something demoniac about thebrain-catching guardian. … In the eschatological conceptions of the Sauk and FoxIndians … the deceased perishes altogether if he is unable to save himself fromthe “brain-smasher.”83 [part0051.html#note1025]George Lankford gives an overview of such myths across North America andconfirms the very widespread nature of the “fearsome image of a ‘brain-smasher,’usually a woman, whose task is to destroy memory (and humanity?) by removing orsmashing the brain.”84 [part0051.html#note1026]An interesting variant, documented by the ethnologist Alanson Skinner in theearly 1920s, comes from the Sauk people, who speak of an obstacle on the Path ofSouls where the celestial river must be crossed:A log serves for a bridge, and this is guarded by a being called Po’kitapawa,“Knocks-a-hole-in-the-head,” or “Brain Taker.” Brain taker has a watch-dog whobarks the alarm whenever a new soul approaches and the fleeting spirit must beswift indeed to avoid having his brains dashed out. If this happens, he isdestroyed or lost forever.85 [part0051.html#note1027]It seems, therefore, that the Native American “brain smasher” and the ancientEgyptian goddess in the vignette from the Fifth Hour of the Duat both serveexactly the same function, namely, the annihilation and permanent destruction ofunworthy souls on the afterlife journey. There are differences in thetraditions, to be sure, as one would expect if they descended from a remotecommon ancestor many millennia ago and then evolved separately, but thefundamental similarities of the role are unmissable.A further point arising from this material has to do with the more general issueof the trials and tribulations faced by the soul on its postmortem journey. Thatthe precise character of these obstacles should vary between ancient Egypt andancient Native America is only to be expected. Even so, the strikingsimilarities in the core structure of the “story”—physical death, a journey ofthe soul on land, a leap to the sky involving Orion followed by a furtherjourney with perils and challenges to be faced, through the valley of the MilkyWay—all argue for some as yet unexplained connection.Image Missing [../images/00124.jpeg]Monstrous winged serpents of the ancient American Netherworld.In the case of Native America a bridge, sometimes shaky, sometimes thin as ablade, from which the soul can easily fall and be lost forever in the ragingtorrent below, is one among several ordeals consistently documented in theethnographic accounts.86 [part0051.html#note1028] Another regular character(who, along with the bridge, appears in one of the recensions of the brainsmasher tradition cited above) is a dog, often monstrous and ferocious,described by the Algonquin as “the dog with the bloody mouth that devours thesouls.”87 [part0051.html#note1029]In some accounts the bridge has the power to transform into a serpent,88[part0051.html#note1030] thus further challenging spirits on the Path. Indeedthe Native American afterlife journey is almost as filled with monster serpentsas the ancient Egyptian Duat. Most notable in this respect is the presence ofthe Great Horned Water Serpent, sometimes described as “Master of the BeneathWorld” and sometimes as “the Great Serpent with the Red Jewel in itsForehead:”89 [part0051.html#note1031]If the free soul knows how to deal with the Serpent and is permitted to pass,then it enters the realm of the dead.90 [part0051.html#note1032]In the ancient Egyptian tradition, too, the guardians of various gates andpassageways in the Duat, often in serpent form, would permit the soul to pass solong as it had “knowledge of certain formulae, or words of power, and magicalnames.”91 [part0051.html#note1033]THE UNDERWATER PANTHER AND THE GREAT SPHINXOTHER NOTABLE CURIOSITIES INCLUDE THE fact, noted earlier, that the serpents ofthe Duat are very often winged92 [part0051.html#note1034] and, in addition, aresometimes depicted with legs and feet.93 [part0051.html#note1035] The same goesfor the Great Horned Water Serpent, almost always winged,94[part0051.html#note1036] and in addition, in a Sioux account, described as a“water monster which … resembled a rattlesnake, but he had short legs.”95[part0051.html#note1037]Because we have the benefit of copious documentation and painted and engravedimages, the descriptions of the Duat that have come down to us from ancientEgypt are more vivid and detailed than the descriptions of the Path of Soulsthat have survived from the Native American oral tradition. Nonetheless, enoughremains to confirm that as well as serpents, many of the other monsters andfiends of the Duat also have their counterparts in the Native American afterlifejourney.96 [part0051.html#note1038]Of particular interest in this respect is the Underwater Panther, a bizarrehybrid figure, described by the Ojibwa as “a curious combination of cougar,rattlesnake, deer and hawk”97 [part0051.html#note1039] and understood to be anavatar, or alter ego, of the Great Horned Water Serpent.98[part0051.html#note1040]Different Native American peoples gave different names and aspects to theUnderwater Panther—Mishebeshu and Michibichi are the most common—but it was alsoknown among the Algonquian-speaking tribes as Pizha, meaning “panther.”99[part0051.html#note1041] On account of this latter name, and of an ancient imageof it that was once visible painted on a bluff above the Mississippi at Alton,Illinois, the Underwater Panther became known to interested European travelersas the “Piasa” and was described confusingly both as a “tiger” and as an “animalof the dragon species.”100 [part0051.html#note1042] In 1839 Arenz and Company ofDÜsseldorf published a line drawing of it “taken on the spot by artists fromGermany,” which is reproduced above. The original petroglyph no longer exists,as the whole face of the bluff on which it was depicted was quarried away in1846–47.101 [part0051.html#note1043]Image Missing [../images/00125.jpeg]Monstrous serpents of the ancient Egyptian Netherworld—winged (right), and withlegs (left).Image Missing [../images/00126.jpeg]Other imagery of the Underwater Panther, long since lost, was seen by NicolasPerrot in 1664, who called it the “Great Panther,” while the Ojibwa todaydescribe it as a “sea tiger,” preserving its watery associations, and as a “hugebrown cat.”102 [part0051.html#note1044] In some accounts it is said that thePiasa has “a human head.”103 [part0051.html#note1045]If the variety of descriptions is bewildering we should not be surprised, for weare dealing with the Netherworld and its shape-shifting denizens here. That theUnderwater Panther was seen as having feline characteristics, however, iscertain from a number of surviving images of the creature.Among them is a pottery figure, reproduced in the collage below, that I was ableto see for myself in the museum at Moundville. Although the scale is completelydifferent, I suggest that it bears more than a passing resemblance to the GreatSphinx of Giza. The Sphinx, of course, has a human head, not the head of afeline, but let’s keep in mind those traditions in which human-headed Piasas aredescribed. Also possibly of relevance here is the evidence that the originalprehistoric Sphinx, perhaps more than 12,000 years old, had the head, as well asthe body, of a lion. After suffering severe erosion over several millennia theleonine head was recut into human form during the early Dynastic period.104[part0051.html#note1046] Last but not least, Native American traditions of theUnderwater Panther speak of a time when “four Piasas existed, each associatedwith its own cardinal direction.”105 [part0051.html#note1047] Is it acoincidence that the Great Sphinx of Giza, with its strong family resemblance tothe Underwater Panther, is an equinoctial marker, oriented precisely to one ofthe four cardinal directions to face the sun as it rises due east on theequinox?Image Missing [../images/00127.jpeg]TOP: Underwater Panther, Moundville.

BOTTOM LEFT:Detail of the tail of the Great Sphinx. Compare with tail of Underwater Panther.DOGS AND OTHER “COINCIDENCES”FEROCIOUS DOGS THAT APPEAR AS obstacles and challenges on the Native Americanafterlife journey have their counterparts among the monsters of the Duatdescribed in the ancient Egyptian books of the dead. “That god who lives byslaughter,” for example, in Spell 335 of the Coffin Texts, “whose face is thatof a hound.”106 [part0051.html#note1048]Nor is that the only curious nexus involving dogs.As an exception to the general rule among Native American peoples, the Cherokeedo not describe the Milky Way as the “Path of Souls” but refer to it, rather, as“Where the Dog Ran.”107 [part0051.html#note1049] This is on account of a myth ofa giant mill standing on one side of the earth-disk where corn was ground intomeal. The store of flour was kept in a great bowl and on several mornings thepeople who attended the mill found that some of the flour was missing. When thethefts continued they investigated and found the tracks of a dog. The nextnight:They watched, and when the dog came … and began to eat the meal out of the bowlthey sprang out and whipped him.108 [part0051.html#note1050]At this, the dog, who lived on the opposite side of the earth-disk, leapt to thesky and fled “howling” across it to his home,with the meal dropping from his mouth as he ran, and leaving behind a whitetrail where now we see the Milky Way, which the Cherokee call to this dayGi’li-utsun’ stanun’ yi, “Where the dog ran.”109 [part0051.html#note1051]What’s strange is that in ancient Egypt, too, where the Milky Way was theWinding Waterway, there is an exception. It’s found in a curious “spell” fromthe Coffin Texts in which no dogs are mentioned but where the deceased declares:I am made a spirit. … I am he who is in charge of secret matters. … I have comeequipped with magic, I have quenched my thirst with it. I live on white emmer,filling the Winding Waterway.110 [part0051.html#note1052]White emmer is, of course, one of the domesticated varieties of wheat, and one,moreover, that was particularly favored in ancient Egypt.111[part0051.html#note1053] As with maize in the Americas, it must be milled toproduce usable flour. In this variant ancient Egyptian tradition, as in thevariant Cherokee tradition, the path in the sky on which the afterlife journeyunfolds is likened to a white trail of milled flour.There are other curiosities.Take the case of the hero-deity known as the “Birdman,” of whom multipledepictions have survived in the Mississippi Valley. He is unmistakably partfalcon, part man, just like the god Horus of the Nile Valley. Just like Horus,the Birdman’s celestial associations include both the Morning Star and theSun.112 [part0051.html#note1054] And just like Horus, the fundamental role ofthe Birdman is to symbolize the triumph of life over death. “Although everyonemust die eventually,” explains Professor James Brown of Northwestern University,life is the victor through the survival of one’s descendants. The avatar of thisstruggle of life to reassert itself in the face of inevitable death is thefalcon, and one of his guises is the Morning Star. In the pre-dawn light theMorning Star beats back the darkness to make way for the life-sustaining sun.The fact that the [Native American myth of the] Birdman has embedded within itthe diurnal progress of night and day, the passage of the heavenly bodies andthe cardinal directions tells us that they are properties of a particularcosmology. These elements are not loosely connected.113 [part0051.html#note1055]This is not the place to elaborate further on the Birdman myth, or on theextensive traditions surrounding the god Horus, one of the most famous andcomplex figures in the ancient Egyptian pantheon. Entire books could be, andhave been, written about each and there are great differences between the two aswell as some rather striking similarities. What remains to be resolved iswhether these similarities are purely coincidental or whether there is somedeep, hidden, and previously undetected connection.Then there’s the question of pygmies and dwarfs. They enjoyed special favor inancient Egypt, where their mummified remains have survived in a number of tombs.They were regarded as possessing more than human powers—there is even a pygmygod named Bes—and they were given positions of importance in the funerarytexts.114 [part0051.html#note1056] For example, in a vignette to chapter 164 ofthe Book of the Dead we see a goddess flanked by two dwarfs, each of whom isdepicted with two heads, one of a man and one of a falcon.115[part0051.html#note1057] And in the Pyramid Texts, the deceased on his afterlifejourney declares:Image Missing [../images/00128.jpeg]LEFT: Engraved whelk shell depicting the ancient Mississippian hero-deityreferred to by archaeologists as the “Birdman.” PHOTO: THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OFTHE AMERICAN INDIAN (NMAI), SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION [18/9121].

PHOTO: RAOUL KIEFFER.I am deemed righteous in the sky and on earth. … I am that pygmy of “the dancesof god” who diverts the god in front of his great throne.116[part0051.html#note1058]Likewise, dwarfs and pygmies enjoyed special favor and respect among ancientNative Americans. Hultkrantz reports “a widespread belief in dwarves on theland, at times associated with the concept of a more or less extinct‘prehistoric’ race, at times linked to the concept of spirit beings.”117[part0051.html#note1059]As in ancient Egypt, the skeletons of dwarfs have been found in ancient NativeAmerican tombs, and as in ancient Egypt, dwarfs were believed to possesssuperhuman and magical powers. There is even evidence of the existence of dwarfshamans in the Mississippi Valley.118 [part0051.html#note1060]Also worthy of note is the appearance and manifestation of souls, and we haveseen already how, in ancient Egypt, the free-flying Ba soul was depicted as abird or as a human-headed bird. “He opens for you the doors of the sky,” thePyramid Texts declare:he throws open for you the doors of the firmament, he makes a road for you thatyou may ascend by means of it into the company of the gods, you being alive inyour bird shape.119 [part0051.html#note1061]In the case of ancient Native America, the free-soul was likewise very oftenpictured and spoken of as a bird. Among the Modoc tribe, for example, a boytraining to become a shaman fell into a deathlike trance. In this condition hemet a female spirit who took out his heart. The boy then heard the spirittalking to his heart, which she held in her hand:After a while she opened her hand and let go of the heart. Then the little boythought he saw a bird coming from the west. It came to him and lighted on hisbreast. That moment he jumped up.120 [part0051.html#note1062]Hultkrantz reports that among the White Knife Shoshoni the soul has theappearance of a bird while “the Huichol identify it as a little white bird andthe Luiseno know that it is a dove. The Kootenay believe that the free-soul canshow itself as a tomtit or a jay.”121 [part0051.html#note1063] … The free-soulof the Bella Coola is like a bird enclosed in an egg [the physical body]; if theshell of the egg breaks and the soul flies away its owner must die.”122[part0051.html#note1064]Once again, then, it seems that some of the fundamental ideas and imagery of thedeath process were held in common in ancient Native America and in ancient Egyptand once again the only question we must decide is whether this is a coincidenceor not.JUDGMENTBOTH THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN AND the ancient Native American afterlife journeysinvolve a strong element of judgment. Indeed, in a sense, the entire ordeal inboth cases concerns the judgment of the soul for its choices—for what it hasdone and not done, for the use that it made of the gift of life—during itsphysical incarnation. In both cases the unworthy soul can face annihilation bygods, demons, and monsters at any point on the journey (for example, at thehands of the “brain-smasher” figure) but in both cases also, for those who haveprogressed thus far through the Netherworld, a specific judgment awaits.In the ancient Egyptian system the judgment scene occurs in the Fifth Division(or “Hour”) of the Duat, in the Judgment Hall of Osiris, also known as the Hallof Maat—a location that can be reached only by those who are sufficientlyprovided with spiritual protection to make it through the first four divisions.I have described the scene at length in previous books, and will not repeat allthe details here. In summary, however, the deceased is ushered into a great hallor chamber at the head of which, in partially mummified form, sits Osiris, thehigh god of death and resurrection, identified in the ancient Egyptian skyreligion with the constellation Orion. Also present, wearing a featherheaddress, is Maat, the goddess of truth and cosmic justice, and forty-twodispassionate figures, crouched in the manner of scribes poring over papyrus,each wearing the feather of Maat, which symbolizes truth. These are theforty-two Assessors of the Dead, before each of whom the deceased must be ableto declare himself innocent of certain acts of moral wrongdoing—notably the actof murder.Having completed this stage of its examination the soul now finds itselfconfronted by an immense pair of scales beneath the arms of which are to be seenrepresentations of Anubis, the jackal-headed guide of souls, and Horus, thefalcon-headed son of Osiris. One pan of the scales contains an object, shapedlike a small urn, symbolizing the heart of the deceased, “considered to be theseat of intelligence and thus the instigator of man’s actions andconscience.”123 [part0051.html#note1065] In the other pan is placed the featherof Maat, symbolizing, once again, Truth.Image Missing [../images/00129.jpeg]If the soul is to triumph in the judgment, heart and feather must stand poisedin equilibrium and the prize of eternal life in the Osirian kingdom of the deadbeckons. But if the heart is heavy with wickedness and willful waste of the giftof life, if it does not balance with the feather of Truth, then eternalannihilation awaits. To remind us of this, beyond the scales in every depictionof the judgment scene we see the agency of the soul’s extinction—a monstroushybrid, part crocodile, part lion, part hippopotamus, who is known as Amit, the“Devourer,” the “Eater of the Dead,” in whose slavering jaws the “unjustified”soul is utterly destroyed.124 [part0051.html#note1066]In the ancient Native North American afterlife journey the judgment scene isnowhere so formalized and elaborate as it is the ancient Egyptian version butthere is nonetheless—and unmistakably so—a judgment. In the early 1900s, forexample, Francis La Flesche, a member of the Omaha tribe of Nebraska and WesternIowa, cooperated with Alice C. Fletcher of Harvard’s Peabody Museum to recordthe traditions of his people. The result, published by the Bureau of AmericanEthnology in 1911, includes the following account of a crucial moment in theafterlife journey:It was said that at the forks of the path of the dead (the Milky Way) there “satan old man wrapped in a buffalo robe, and when the spirits of the dead passedalong he turned the steps of the good and peaceable people toward the short pathwhich led directly to the abode of their relatives, but allowed the contumaciousto take the long path, over which they wearily wandered. …” The simple andancient belief seems to have been that the Milky Way is the Path of the Dead. Itwas said also that the spirit of a murderer “never found his way to hisrelatives but kept on endlessly searching but never finding rest.”125[part0051.html#note1067]Likewise the late Joseph Epes Brown, founder of the Native American StudiesProgram at Indiana University, gives this account of the afterlife journey ofthe Sioux:It is held … that the released soul travels southward along the “Spirit Path”(the Milky Way) until it comes to a place where this way divides. Here an oldwoman, called Maya owichapaha, sits; “She who pushes them over the bank,” whojudges the souls; the worthy ones she allows to travel on the path which goes tothe right, but the unworthy she “pushes over the bank,” to the left.126[part0051.html#note1068]In 1967 Ake Hultkrantz joined Fletcher and Brown in linking such traditions tothe fact that:the path of souls is not always one and undivided. In the northern hemispherethe Milky Way splits into two streaks. Not unexpectedly, the Indians haveassociated this phenomenon with concepts of different passageways to the otherworld and of dissimilar fates after death. Tradition has it that one road …leads to the blessed land of the dead and the other brings downfall andannihilation.127 [part0051.html#note1069]To this George Lankford adds a crucial insight that Hultkrantz missed, namelythat there is “a bright star—Deneb—that is placed right at the fork in the pathand thus could serve as a marker for the decision point or a figure who does thedeciding.”128 [part0051.html#note1070]Again a long story must be cut short here, but what Lankford goes on todemonstrate is that a ferocious bird, a raptor with a hooked beak, is a verydistinctive “opponent” or “adversary” on the afterlife journey, as portrayed inMoundville pottery. In his view this “Moundville Raptor” is the Mississippianequivalent of the old woman who pushes souls over the bank or the old man whocondemns the souls of murderers to endless wandering without rest. And toreinforce his argument, he draws our attention to the Alabamas and theSeminoles, “two groups who are major candidates for descendants of theprehistoric inhabitants of Moundville,” who indeed place an eagle in the role ofan adversary on the Milky Way path of souls.129 [part0051.html#note1071]Deneb is of course Alpha Cygni, the first-magnitude master star of the Cygnusconstellation, which the Greeks identified as a bird, and specifically as aswan. “It is a satisfying coincidental possibility,” writes Lankford, “that thepeople of Moundville saw it the same way, but with the identity of an eaglerather than a swan.”130 [part0051.html#note1072]Since his specialty is Native American religions, there is no reason whyLankford should have studied the ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts. Had he done so,however, he would surely have been struck by Utterance 304, in which the soul onits journey through the Duat is confronted by a bird adversary that apparentlyhas the power to block its path. It’s difficult to give any other interpretationto this encounter since the soul is made to declare:Image Missing [../images/00130.jpeg]The star Deneb in the constellation we know as Cygnus, the Swan, is positionedon the bank of the Milky Way exactly at the fork where a second “path,” a deadend, branches off. George Lankford identifies Deneb—and Cygnus as a whole—withthe Moundville Raptor figure (inset), an adversary on the journey of the soul.Hail to you, Ostrich which is on the bank of the Winding Waterway! Open my waythat I may pass.131 [part0051.html#note1073]An ostrich is not a swan and a swan is not an eagle. Nonetheless, it is surelynoteworthy that in both the ancient Egyptian and the ancient Mississippianreligions we encounter a bird, with the power to block the further progress ofthe soul, poised on a bank of the Milky Way.What else but recognition of the same fork in the Milky Way that was regarded asso ominous in Native American myth can be expressed in Utterance 697 of thePyramid Texts, where we read:Do not travel on those western waterways, for those who travel thereon do notreturn, but travel on the eastern waterways.132 [part0051.html#note1074]ASTRONOMER CHIEFSIN THE COFFIN TEXTS, IN a passage that addresses the deceased, we read:May you recognise your soul in the upper sky while your flesh, your corpse, isin On.”133 [part0051.html#note1075]The latter location, now a suburb of Cairo 12 miles to the northeast of theimmense Old Kingdom burial fields and world-famous pyramids of Giza, was thecenter of the religious cult that served the Giza necropolis in antiquity. Itwas the Biblical Hebrews who called this cult center On—there are references toit in Genesis, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel.134 [part0051.html#note1076] Its originalname in the ancient Egyptian language, however, was Innu—“the pillar”—and theGreeks would later know it as Heliopolis, “the City of the Sun.”135[part0051.html#note1077]The Pyramid Texts, from which the Coffin Texts and all the later funerary textsdescended, are often referred to as the “Heliopolitan Recension of the Book ofthe Dead”136 [part0051.html#note1078] because they are thought to haveoriginated in the archives of the cult center of Heliopolis. The archives havenot survived the millennia, but the texts themselves are convincing evidencethat something such must have existed since they “contain formulae andparagraphs which, judging from the grammatical forms that occur in them, musthave been composed, if not actually written down, in the earliest times ofEgyptian civilization.”137 [part0051.html#note1079]Let’s note in passing that the High Priest of Heliopolis bore the title “Chiefof the Astronomers” and is represented in tomb paintings and statuary wearing amantle adorned with stars.138 [part0051.html#note1080] It is therefore ofinterest, when ethnographers recorded the customs and beliefs of the SkidiPawnee of Oklahoma in the nineteenth century, that they were reported to haveshamans, raised to the rank of chiefs, who specialized in astronomy. In thearchives of the Smithsonian Institution there is a photograph of one of theseindividuals, named His Chiefly Sun, and notably he is shown wearing a mantleadorned with stars.139 [part0051.html#note1081] It was also the custom of theSkidi Pawnee to wrap a newborn baby in a speckled wildcat skin. This,ethnographers were told,was equivalent to saying, “I wrap the child with the heavens,” for the hiderepresented the sky and stars.140 [part0051.html#note1082]Image Missing [../images/00131.jpeg]LEFT: In ancient Egypt priests wearing a leopard-skin mantle, on which the spotsrepresented stars, played a key role in mortuary ceremonies to prepare thedeceased for the afterlife journey. IMAGE FROM TUTANKHAMUN’S TOMB. CENTER: TheHigh Priest of Heliopolis, the cult center of the Giza pyramids, was titled the“Chief of the Astronomers” and wore a mantle like this one adorned with stars.PHOTO: FEDERICO TAVERNI AND NICOLA DELL’AQUILA/MUSEO EGIZIO. RIGHT: Skidi,Pawnee Astronomer Chief. PHOTO: THE NATIONAL ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHIVES (NAA),SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION [BAE GN 01285].In the case of the Heliopolitan “Chief of the Astronomers” we can see clearlyfrom surviving depictions that the mantle he wore, upon which stars wereembossed, was in fact a leopard skin. When the leopard skin was left undecoratedthe spots of the leopard itself were believed to have symbolized stars.141[part0051.html#note1083] A specialized class of priests, the Sem Priests, alsowearing leopard-skin mantles, played a key role in mortuary ceremonies for thedeceased.142 [part0051.html#note1084]There is no dispute that the great Mississippian religious centers like Cahokiaand Moundville were primarily focused on a cult of the dead, and while not everymound in these sites contains a burial, or multiple burials, the vast majoritydo. This is also the case at many other mound and earthwork sites in NorthAmerica. Even some of the very earliest, such as Monte Sano, contain evidence ofthe postmortem processing of bodies.143 [part0051.html#note1085] The Adenamounds are largely burial mounds.144 [part0051.html#note1086] And as to theHopewell earthworks, William Romain writes:By far the vast majority of known … remains are interred in mounds locatedwithin the geometric enclosures. Necessarily, then, the physical relationshipbetween the remains of the dead and the enclosures tells us that the Hopewelldid, indeed, associate the geometric enclosures with the passage of theindividual from life to death.145 [part0051.html#note1087]It may even be, Romain adds,that the Hopewell considered the geometric enclosures to be actual gateways, ordoorways, to the otherworld. Certainly the idea of architectural structuresbeing used to create entrances to the otherworld was known throughout NorthAmerica. The circular hole in the top of the Ojibway shaking tent, for example,was specifically meant to allow for “soul-flight travel to the Hole in the Skyand across the barrier to the spirit realm.”146 [part0051.html#note1088]Though different in degree in terms of the engineering required, there is nodifference in kind between the hole in the Ojibwa tent and the star-shaft in theGreat Pyramid—which likewise appears to have been intended to facilitatesoul-travel to the sky across the barrier to the spirit realm.Similarly, although there is again a marked difference of degree, there is nodifference in kind between the geometric, astronomically aligned structures ofthe Giza plateau and the geometric, astronomically aligned structures of theMississippi Valley. All of them seem bound together by the single purpose of thetriumph of the soul over death and by the means deployed to achieve thatpurpose.But why were structures required at all? And why these specific kinds ofstructures?"},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00132.jpeg]ASTRONOMY AND GEOMETRY IN THE AFTERLIFEI’M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE religion of ancient Egypt was brought from there toancient North America and I’m not suggesting that the religion of ancient NorthAmerica was brought to ancient Egypt. I accept the scientific consensus that theOld World and the New World have been isolated from one another, with nosignificant genetic or cultural contacts, for more than 12,000 years. Also, thesimilarities between the religious systems practiced in ancient Egypt andancient North America are not such as could be explained by direct “missionary”or “conversion” activities at any time, whether relatively early or relativelylate. There are too many stark and obvious differences, too deeply adapted tolocal conditions and local cultural circumstances, for this to be the case.What, then, are we to make of the striking package of shared beliefs and symbolsreviewed in the previous chapter? In both cases we have a journey of the soul toa staging ground in the west, a “leap” to a portal in the constellation Orion,transition through that portal to the Milky Way, a journey along the Milky Wayduring which challenges and ordeals are faced, and a judgment at which thesoul’s destiny is decided.Just as the differences rule out direct influence so, too, in my view, thesimilarities are too many and too obvious to be dismissed as mere“coincidences.” A better explanation needs to be sought and in this respect it’shelpful to remember that analogous situations arise in genetics. Sometimes, forexample, two seemingly completely different groups of people, separated by hugedistances and formidable geographic barriers and with zero opportunity to tradeDNA, nevertheless turn out to share certain distinct clusters of genes. In thesecases the answer very often lies in an earlier population, perhaps with noliving members today—a “ghost” population—that was the remote common ancestor ofboth otherwise unrelated populations in which the surprising geneticresemblances have been found.In the realm of archaeology, E. A. Wallis Budge faced a comparable problem withsimilarities he had identified between the Mesopotamian deity Sin, a moon god,and the ancient Egyptian deity Thoth, also associated with the moon. Theresemblances, in Budge’s view, are “too close to be accidental. It would bewrong to say that the Egyptians borrowed from the Sumerians or the Sumeriansfrom the Egyptians, but it may be submitted that the literati of both peoplesborrowed their theological systems from some common but exceedingly ancientsource.”1 [part0051.html#note1089]Walter Emery, late Edwards Professor of Egyptology at the University of London,also looked into similarities between ancient Egypt and ancient Mesopotamia. Hefound it impossible to explain them as the result of the direct influence of oneculture upon the other and concluded:The impression we get is of an indirect connection, and perhaps the existence ofa third party, whose influence spread to both the Euphrates and the Nile. …Modern scholars have tended to ignore the possibility of immigration to bothregions from some hypothetical and as yet undiscovered area. [However] a thirdparty whose cultural achievements were passed on independently to Egypt andMesopotamia would best explain the common features and fundamental differencesbetween the two civilizations.2 [part0051.html#note1090]What I’m suggesting is essentially the same. The hypothesis that best explainsthe puzzling common features and fundamental differences between the religionsof ancient Egypt and ancient North America is that an even more ancientreligion, of as yet unidentified provenance, was ancestral to both. The presenceof its “DNA” in Egypt and North America also has chronological implications. Inview of the evidence that the Old and New Worlds were isolated for more than12,000 years, from the end of the Ice Age until the time of Columbus, the remotecommon ancestor of the religions that would later blossom in the Nile andMississippi River valleys must therefore be more than 12,000 years old. Isuggest that this ancestral religion—perhaps system would be a better word—usedastronomical and geometrical memes expressed in architectural projects ascarriers through which it reproduced itself across cultures and down through theages, and that it was a characteristic of the system that it could lie dormantfor millennia and then mysteriously reappear in full flower.Image Missing [../images/00133.jpeg]The ayahuasca-inspired art of the Shipibo, in the Peruvian Amazon, is noted forits complex geometrical imagery.

TOP RIGHT: “DADEROT.”Though it is not my purpose to argue this case here, the possibility that thesystem still hibernates in some form or another in the twenty-first centurycannot be ruled out, nor the possibility that it might at some point be awakenedagain in a garb suited to its time.Indeed, might we not already be seeing the first intimations of this with theexplosion of interest all around the world in ayahuasca as a teacher plant, andin the parallel growth in public exposure to the initiating geometries ofayahuasca-inspired art?The notion that human agents were behind the spread of the system is notcontradicted by this suggestion. On the contrary, the system may itself have hadits origins in visionary experiences, in which case those responsible for itsspread would surely have made use of “plant allies” wherever they could findthem.ANSWERS IN UNEXPECTED PLACES?BECAUSE OF THE BURNING OF the library of Alexandria and the frenzied despoilingof the temples by fanatical Christian mobs in the fifth and sixth centuries,much of the legacy of wisdom that made ancient Egypt the “light of the world”has been lost. Nevertheless, because they carved so much in stone, and wrote somuch down on papyrus and other media, and because they were enormously prolificartists and builders for more than 3,000 years, the ancient Egyptians have leftus a vast legacy of knowledge about their spiritual ideas.The immense destruction, genocide, and near-total obliteration of indigenouscultures unleashed in North America during the European conquest was a matter ofan entirely different order—a full-blown, fast-moving cultural cataclysm, as aresult of which we’re left often with no record at all or with huge gaps in therecord. Thus, although we can be sure the great earthworks and mounds of theMississippi Valley were connected to beliefs about death and the afterlife, nomyths or traditions have survived to explain why it was essential to thesebeliefs that geoglyphs and mounds should be built or why these structures shouldincorporate complex geometry and astronomical alignments.After all a vast expenditure of energy, effort, ingenuity, manpower, andorganizational skills was required to create a Cahokia or a Moundville or aNewark Earthworks or, for that matter, a Watson Brake, so it makes no sense thatsuch projects would have been undertaken without some enormously importantmotive that inspired all the participants. In the absence of surviving evidenceof what that motive was in North America, could it be possible that the ancientEgyptian funerary texts might provide an answer?SQUARES, RECTANGLES, ELLIPSES, AND CIRCLESI REMEMBERED FROM MY EARLIER encounters with the texts that they includedreferences to geometry and sought out those references now.A few examples.In chapter 108 of the Book of the Dead we read of the “Mountain of Sunrise … inthe eastern heaven. It hath dimensions of 30,000 cubits in length and 15,000cubits in breadth.”3 [part0051.html#note1091]That’s a perfect 2-by-1 rectangle, no matter what system of measure you convertit into, equivalent roughly to 15,000 meters by 7,500 meters.Strange “mountain!”In chapter 81 there’s an obscure geometrical reference to “four sides of thedomain of Ra and the width of the earth four times.”4 [part0051.html#note1092]Ra is the Sun God and it is the business of “geometry”—literally“earth-measuring”—to know the “width of the earth.”Turning to chapter 110 of the Book of the Dead, we read:The god Horus maketh himself to be strong like unto the Hawk which is onethousand cubits in length and two thousand cubits in width.5[part0051.html#note1093]It seems a scribe copying from an older source document mixed up the concepts oflength and width but what is defined here is nonetheless a 2-by-1 rectangle withdimensions of approximately 1,000 meters by 500 meters.In the Book of What Is in the Duat another rectangular district is mentioned.Named Sekhet-Hetepet, its long and short dimensions are so close that it isalmost, and in the vignettes appears visually to be, a square. Its shape isdefined by an unbroken water-filled moat. The land within it is intersected bycanals.6 [part0051.html#note1094]Image Missing [../images/00134.jpeg]Sekhet-Hetepet (Papyrus of Nebseni, BRITISH MUSEUM).A second district of the Duat, named “Tchau,” is “440 cubits in length and 440cubits in width.”7 [part0051.html#note1095]That’s a perfect square, no matter what system of measure you convert it into,equivalent to roughly 220 meters by 220 meters.Later, in the Seventh Division of the Duat, another square enclosure ofidentical dimensions is encountered.8 [part0051.html#note1096]In the Land of Sokar, part of the Fifth Division, and the location of theJudgment scene, we meet a “goddess of the apex.”9 [part0051.html#note1097] Inthat same division we also encounter “the god of his angle” whose hieroglyphincorporates a right triangle,10 [part0051.html#note1098] fundamental forsurveying and trigonometry. The heart of the Land of Sokar, which rests on thebacks of two man-headed lion sphinxes set tail to tail, is formed by anelongated ellipse over the top of which looms a pyramid with its apex in theform of the head of a goddess.11 [part0051.html#note1099]Image Missing [../images/00135.jpeg]Pyramid over elliptical enclosure in the Land of Sokar.Turning to the Coffin Texts, we find a gigantic ship or “bark” described withthe following dimensions:A million cubits are half the length of the bark; starboard, bow, stern andlarboard are four million cubits.12 [part0051.html#note1100]That’s around 500 kilometers for “half the length of the bark” and a combinedtotal of 2,000 kilometers for its other listed parts, a geometrical progressionwith a ratio of 4.Among the squares, rectangles, and ellipses of ancient Egypt’s starryNetherworld there are also perfect circles everywhere.Staying with the Coffin Texts, we read of “the circle of the Pillar of Horuswhich is north of the opening of darkness.”13 [part0051.html#note1101]In the Book of the Dead we meet “the gods of the Querti”—literally the“Circles”—to whom the soul on its afterlife journey was obliged to sing hymns ofpraise.14 [part0051.html#note1102]In the Book of What Is in the Duat, in the Fifth Division and associated withRa, the Sun God, we are told of a “Circle” that “unites itself with the roads ofthe Duat.”15 [part0051.html#note1103] In the Seventh Division a journey is made“in the path of the Circle of Osiris,”16 [part0051.html#note1104] while in theEighth Division we learn of “the Circles of the hidden gods who are on theirsand.”17 [part0051.html#note1105] In addition, five “Circles of the Duat,” eachentered through a “door,” are described.18 [part0051.html#note1106]And throughout the texts we hear repeatedly of “the hidden Circle of theDuat,”19 [part0051.html#note1107] a location of great significance, as we shallsee. There are indications that the Duat itself was considered to be circular inform. As Wallis Budge points out, there is a scene in the Book of Gates thatdepicts “the body of Osiris bent round in a circle and the hieroglyphicsenclosed within it declare that it is the Duat.”20 [part0051.html#note1108]Image Missing [../images/00136.jpeg]SUN AND MOONAS WELL AS MULTIPLE REFERENCES to stars and constellations, too numerous andall-pervasive in the funerary texts to require special mention here,21[part0051.html#note1109] the moon is frequently encountered on the journeythrough the Duat. In the Second Division, for example, a vignette shows a boat,the purpose of which, as Budge describes it, is “to support the disk of the fullmoon. … By the disk kneels a god who is ‘supporting Maat,’ which is symbolizedby a feather, and is described by the word MAAT.”22 [part0051.html#note1110]Central to the ancient Egyptian judgment scene described in the previouschapter, the concept of Maat enshrines notions of cosmic justice, harmony, andbalance. Its association with the moon is appropriate since the moon indeedplays a key “balancing” or “stabilising” role for the earth.23[part0051.html#note1111]The sun is also often figured as being carried aboard a boat and also featuresprominently in the Duat, blazing an indomitable path through its terrors eachnight, a symbol of hope and resurrection in whose company, if they arefortunate, the souls of some of the deceased might be permitted to ride. Thatmuch might be expected, but what is interesting are passages in the texts thathelp us to understand the special attention paid by the ancient Egyptians to thesolstices, with several of the greatest temples of the Nile Valley, notably theTemple of Karnak at Luxor, incorporating spectacular solstitial alignments.A defining characteristic of the solstices, around June 21 and December 21 whenthe sun reaches its northernmost and southernmost rising and setting points, isthat the pendulum swing of the solar disk along the horizon appears to pause or“stand still,” without further northward or southward movement, for an intervalof 3 days. In this connection let’s recall the peculiarly geometrical “Mountainof Sunrise.” The passage concerning it in chapter 108 of the Book of the Deadthat I cited earlier continues as follows:There is a serpent on the brow of that Mountain, and he measureth 30 cubits inlength; the first 8 cubits of its length are covered with flints and withshining metal plates. … Now after Ra hath stood still he inclineth his eyestowards him and a stoppage of the boat of Ra taketh place, and a mighty sleepcometh upon him that is in the boat.24 [part0051.html#note1112]It’s difficult to interpret this passage in any other way than a colorful,lyrical, poetic description of a solstice.Similarly, in the Coffin Texts we read:I am here from the lifting up of the horizon that I may show Ra at the gates ofthe sky. … A path is prepared for Ra when he comes to a halt.25[part0051.html#note1113]Again, what else but a solstice could possibly bring Ra, the almighty Sun God,to a halt?EARTHWORKSTHERE ARE CAUSEWAYS IN THE ancient Egyptian Netherworld.“I will travel on that great causeway,” proclaims the deceased in Spell 629 ofthe Coffin Texts, “on which those whose shapes are great travel.”26[part0051.html#note1114]In Utterance 676 of the Pyramid Texts, in a passage that calls to mind apilgrimage with relics, we read:Do for him what you did for his brother Osiris on that day of putting the bonesin order, of making good the soles, and of traveling the causeway.27[part0051.html#note1115]And in Utterance 718:The Mourning Woman summons you as Isis, the Mooring-post calls to you asNepthys, you having appeared upon your causeway.28 [part0051.html#note1116]Very frequently when causeways are mentioned it’s in specific association withmounds. The above passage continues:May you travel around your Horite Mounds [i.e., mounds consecrated to the godHorus], may you travel around your Sethite Mounds [i.e., mounds consecrated tothe god Seth]. You have your spirit, O my father the King … make yourself into aspirit.29 [part0051.html#note1117]In Utterance 470 the deceased informs the soul of his mother, the “Lady of theSecret Land:”“I am going to the sky that I may see my father.”“To the High Mounds?” she asks, “or to the Mounds of Seth?”“The High Mounds,” the deceased replies, “will pass me on to the Mounds ofSeth.”30 [part0051.html#note1118]It’s a very curious, obviously coded language, beyond the reach ofstraightforward translation, that continues throughout the funerary texts.As well as Horite Mounds and Sethite Mounds there are the Mounds of Osiris,31[part0051.html#note1119] and also the Southern Mounds and the Northern Moundsthat the soul must travel to and traverse on its journey through the Duat.32[part0051.html#note1120] And the structure in the Fifth Division of the Duatthat Budge refers to as a pyramid is also sometimes described as a “hollowmound,”33 [part0051.html#note1121] and as a “mound of earth.”34[part0051.html#note1122]In the Coffin Texts we hear of “the gods on their mounds,”35[part0051.html#note1123] and later that “mounds will be towns and towns will bemounds.”36 [part0051.html#note1124]There are also frequent references to “cities of the gods,” as in:A divine city hath been built for me; I know it and I know the name thereof.Sekhet-Aaru is its name.37 [part0051.html#note1125]Or:I come from the city of the god, the primeval region.38 [part0051.html#note1126]I mention these “city” references because if towns can be mounds and mounds canbe towns, then “cities” presumably can also be towns and therefore mounds aswell? Moreover, the whole picture immediately becomes much more complicated whenwe read of a god who “setteth the stars in their places”39[part0051.html#note1127] only for the translator to immediately qualify that theword he’s chosen to render as “places” actually means “towns.” What this god isdoing, therefore—though it seemed an impossible concept to the translator—isliterally setting stars down to earth in “towns.”And we already know that towns can be mounds and mounds can be towns. That bothshould also be stars is not at all a contradiction if you just … think like anEgyptian!HOW TO EQUIP A SPIRIT FOR JOURNEYINGTHE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS SAW THEIR lives as their opportunity to prepare for thetrials of the journey through the Duat that they would have to confront as soulsafter death. The stakes were high, with both eternal annihilation andimmortality being possible outcomes of that journey. There was undoubtedly anethical aspect to the Judgment, as we’ve seen, but something else was alsorequired, some gnosis, some deep understanding, and very strangely it turns outto be the case that those who truly sought the prize of immortality—“the life ofmillions of years”—were called upon first to build on the ground perfect copies“of the hidden circle of the Duat in the body of Nut [the sky].”40[part0051.html#note1128]Whoever shall make an exact copy of these forms, and shall know it, shall be aspirit well-equipped both in heaven and earth, unfailingly, and regularly andeternally.41 [part0051.html#note1129]Whosoever shall make a copy thereof, and shall know it upon earth, it shall actas a magical protector for him both in heaven and upon earth.42[part0051.html#note1130]If copies of these things be made according to the ordinances of the hiddenhouse, and after the manner of that which is ordered in the hidden house, theyshall act as magical protectors to the man who maketh them.43[part0051.html#note1131]He who hath no knowledge of the whole or part of the secret representations ofthe Duat shall be condemned to destruction.44 [part0051.html#note1132]Whosoever shall know these secret images shall be in the condition of a spiritwho is equipped for journeying.45 [part0051.html#note1133]Wrapped up in the colorful archaic language is a belief—or perhaps theinculcation of a belief—that the immortal destiny of the soul can be influencedby an architectural project to copy on the ground a “hidden” or “secret” part ofthe Duat sky region, the coordinates of which are set down in archives in the“hidden house.”Egyptologists already accept that the Milky Way and the constellation Orion onits west bank are key markers in the celestial geography of the Duat, and in1996 Robert Bauval and I made the case in our book The Message of the Sphinxthat the constellation Leo was very much part of the Duat as well. To cut a longstory short, our argument, which we stand by today, is that the ideas expressedin the funerary texts were indeed manifested in architecture in Egypt in theform of the Great Pyramid, the leonine Sphinx, and the underground corridors andchambers beneath these monuments.The complex was constructed, we believe, as a three-dimensional replica, model,or simulation of the intensely geometrical Fifth Division of the Duat, alsoknown as the “Kingdom of Sokar” and always regarded as an especially hidden andsecret place.46 [part0051.html#note1134] Moreover, we suggest that whatmotivated the population to support this gigantic project was precisely thepromise of thus obtaining that “magical protection,” that power to become “aspirit equipped for journeying,” that would ensure a successful afterlifepassage through the Duat.It is not necessary, for the sake of my argument, to enter into any debate aboutthe merits or demerits of such beliefs. It is enough to say that they wereclearly held in ancient Egypt over an immensely long span of time and that theproof of this is in the books of the dead and in the Giza architectural complex.Nor is it controversial to add that it was around the belief system expressed inthose texts and monuments that the entire extraordinary civilization of theancient Nile Valley was organized and mobilized from the very beginning—andsince that civilization endured and fed its people and nourished theirspirituality for more than 3,000 years, it’s also obvious that at somefundamental level something about the system worked.QUESTIONS AND ANSWERSSO WE RETURN TO THE question of why, over a period of many thousands of years,sometimes punctuated by long, culturally barren intervals, huge numbers ofarchitectural projects were undertaken up and down North America’s MississippiValley linked to a very distinctive set of beliefs about the afterlife journeyof the soul that shared many core elements with the spiritual cosmology ofancient Egypt.If the resemblances are coincidental, we would not expect the ancient Egyptianfunerary texts to provide immediate, sensible answers to some outstandingquestions about the monuments of the Mississippi Valley. The fact that they do,in my view, increases the likelihood that we’re looking at a real connection.Why are the Mississippi Valley sites built on such a gigantic scale and why arecelestial alignments of such importance within them?For the same reasons given in the ancient Egyptian funerary texts for theconstruction of the sky-ground architecture of the Nile Valley—that the sky isgigantic and the purpose of the architecture is to honor, connect with, andabove all “resemble the sky.”Why are the Orion constellation and the Milky Way so important in the funerarysymbolism of the Mississippian culture? And why is the Milky Way the “Path ofSouls”?For the same reason given in the ancient Egyptian funerary texts—that within thegeneral frame of the starry sky it is specifically Orion that hosts the portalthrough which the soul must pass to reach the “Winding Waterway” that in turnleads the soul onward on its journey through the Land of the Dead.Why is geometry, and its particular manifestation in the form of rectangular,square, circular, and elliptical enclosures, such a significant element of theMississippi Valley sites?For the same reasons given in the ancient Egyptian funerary texts for thedistinct geometrical character of the sky-ground architecture of the NileValley—geometry is a foundational characteristic of the Land of the Dead and therectangular, square, circular, and elliptical enclosures are the typical formsof celestial “districts” through which the soul must pass on its afterlifejourney.Why do the Mississippi Valley sites feature causeways and mounds?For the same reasons given in the ancient Egyptian funerary texts for theincorporation of causeways and mounds in the sky-ground architecture of the NileValley—namely, that causeways and mounds are prominent features of the celestialLand of the Dead that it is the purpose of the architecture to replicate onearth.Why were the peoples of the Mississippi Valley willing to expend such greatquantities of treasure and energy on the creation of spectacular sites such asMoundville, Cahokia, and the Newark Earthworks, and why did they take such careto imbue every one of them with intense geometrical characteristics and toensure that each in its own way “resembled” and formed intimate connections withthe sky?For the same reason given in the ancient Egyptian funerary texts—the belief thatif the sky, or some “hidden” or “secret” aspect of it, were NOT copied on theground (and in some way explored, navigated, and known prior to death), thenthose souls who had failed to do this necessary work, and thus were not equippedwith the knowledge of “the secret representations,” would be “condemned todestruction.”SKY AND GROUNDWHEN IT COMES TO MOTIVATIONAL techniques, as the Roman Catholic Churchdemonstrated throughout the Middle Ages, the prospect of eternal damnation canbe very effective. I suggest that in ancient Egypt it was the equivalentprospect of “destruction” or “annihilation” of the soul, and the possibility ofavoiding such a fate—as spelled out in the funerary texts—that motivated theconstruction of the sky-ground temples and pyramids of the Nile Valley. Theywere all, in a sense, gigantic books of the dead in stone and some–the Gizacomplex in particular—were undoubtedly seen as “actual gateways, or doorways, tothe otherworld.”That phrase, “actual gateways, or doorways, to the otherworld,” is WilliamRomain’s, cited at the end of the previous chapter with reference to theHopewell earthworks. I quote it again here to emphasize the peculiarinterchangeability of spiritual beliefs in the Nile Valley and the MississippiValley. Although widely separated in time and space, the ancient inhabitants ofthese two regions seem to have shared a core set of ideas about the afterlifedestiny of the soul and seem, moreover, to have been largely in agreement notonly that those ideas should be manifested in architecture, but also on many ofthe specific characteristics of that architecture, and on the purpose that thearchitecture was intended to serve.Thus, while one reproduced Orion’s belt and the constellation of Leo and theother orchestrated complex architectural dances aligned to lunar and solarstandstills, the fundamental objective of both was to open portals between skyand ground through which the souls of the dead could pass.I’m not ruling out the possibility that some of the monuments of the MississippiValley are “constellation diagrams”—or constituent parts of “constellationdiagrams”—much like the Giza monuments. Indeed Ross Hamilton, as we saw in part1, has long been of the opinion that Serpent Mound is a terrestrial figure ofthe constellation Draco. George Lankford, on the other hand, makes a strong casethat it represents the constellation Scorpius.47 [part0051.html#note1135] Thepoint is not whether one is right or wrong, but that both see the possibilitythat the mounds and earthworks could have been used to represent constellations.Perhaps we’ll never know for sure, since so much of North America’spre-Columbian heritage has been destroyed. Nevertheless, efforts are alreadybeing made.Stepping back in time from the Mississippian civilization, for example, WilliamRomain’s detailed studies of the Hopewell lead him to conclude that, in theminds of those who made them:the Newark Earthworks were a portal to the Otherworld that allowed forinterdimensional movement of the soul during certain solar, lunar and stellarconfigurations.48 [part0051.html#note1136]He also argues that the “Great Hopewell Road,” an ancient causeway that once ranstraight for more than 60 miles between Newark and High Bank (see chapter 20[part0033.html#VF2I0-6d489586c24d4bc6a7d8fba43c80bb24]), “was the terrestrialequivalent of, or metaphor for the Milky Way Path of Souls providing adirectional component for soul travel to the Realm of the Dead.”49[part0051.html#note1137]Further, Romain joins George Lankford in linking Serpent Mound to Scorpius andin concluding that “Serpent Mound was a cognate for the Great Lowerworld Serpentwhich guarded the Realm of the Dead.”50 [part0051.html#note1138]What confronts us with the Hopewell, then, as with ancient Egypt and as with theMississippian civilization, is a Realm of the Dead in the sky and itsrepresentation by architectural structures on the ground. It is part of thebrilliance of such structures that they can play multiple roles in the cosmicdrama. Thus, while the Great Sphinx may be the terrestrial counterpart of theconstellation Leo, its gaze also sacralizes the union of heaven and earth atsunrise on the equinoxes. And while Serpent Mound may indeed be the earthly twinof the constellation Scorpius, its open jaws and the oval earthwork between themalso serve to unite ground and sky at sunset on the summer solstice.In this connection, let’s reconsider the reference cited earlier from the Bookof the Dead concerning a great serpent on the brow of a mountain that brings theboat of the Sun God Ra to a halt, plunging that deity into a “mighty sleep” withnothing more than a glance.51 [part0051.html#note1139] It may, of course, be acoincidence, but this description resonates curiously with the situation ofSerpent Mound. For what do we encounter there on the bluff above Brush Creek ifnot a massive serpent effigy with its gaze targeted on the sun at its midsummerstandstill? That’s indeed a time, as we’ve seen, when the setting point of thesolar disk appears to remain fixed at the same place on the horizon for 3 days,an event that might appropriately be expressed, in mythical language, as a“mighty sleep” brought on by the precisely aimed gaze of the Serpent.Then, too, the great serpent in the Book of the Dead is described as having “thefirst 8 cubits of its length”—its head and neck, in other words—“covered withflints and with shining metal plates.”52 [part0051.html#note1140] The resonancehere is with George Lankford’s study of Native American traditions of the GreatHorned Water Serpent (see chapter 23[part0037.html#1394Q0-6d489586c24d4bc6a7d8fba43c80bb24]), sometimes described asthe “Master of the Beneath World” and sometimes as “the Great Serpent with theRed Jewel in its Forehead”—a notion not so very far away from the ancientEgyptian representation in which the creature’s head and neck glitter “withflints and with shining metal.” It is this Great Jeweled Serpent, Lankfordconcludes, represented as an adversary on the Path of Souls, that is depictedvery frequently in Moundville designs where it is directly linked to otherimagery associated with the afterlife journey. He also makes a strong case thatSerpent Mound is a three-dimensional representation of the same supernaturalentity53 [part0051.html#note1141] and draws an interesting comparison with mythsof the Cherokees describing the Uktena, “a great snake, as large around as atree-trunk,” with:a bright blazing crest like a diamond on its forehead, and scales glitteringlike sparks of fire.54 [part0051.html#note1142]The same myths also tell us that the gaze of this serpent had the power to“daze” people so that they were stopped in their tracks and could not escapefrom it,55 [part0051.html#note1143] and again there is a notable parallel herewith the great serpent of the Book of the Dead whose gaze plunges even the Suninto a “mighty sleep.”56 [part0051.html#note1144]Image Missing [../images/00137.jpeg]Kheti, a serpent of the Duat.RENEWAL AND REBIRTHSCHOLARS ARE IN NO DOUBT that the ideas about the afterlife journey of the soulexpressed in the ancient Egyptian funerary texts are much older than thesurviving inscriptions and extend far back into the oral traditions of thepre-dynastic, pre-literate period before 5,500 years ago.57[part0051.html#note1145]Likewise, although we have no hieroglyphs or inscriptions from North America,it’s noteworthy that the same geometrical concerns and the very same alignmentto the summer solstice sunset that we see at Serpent Mound, supposedly from the“Adena” period around 2,300 years ago, are also present at Watson Brake 5,500years ago. And indeed we may say that the sudden burst of mound-building andearthwork construction across the Lower Mississippi Valley between 6,000 and5,000 years ago is mysterious and unexplained. Like the sudden and fully formedappearance of the high civilization of Egypt, it seems just to have come out ofnowhere, with no apparent antecedents, yet already in possession of advancedknowledge.The earliest mound sites we know of in North America may possibly date back asfar as 8,000 years.58 [part0051.html#note1146] After that the trail goes cold.But then why should we be surprised? The trail goes cold for a full 1,000 yearsbetween the end of the Watson Brake epoch and the beginning of Poverty Point,and it goes cold again several times thereafter, only to reappear reborn andrenewed on the far side of each lacuna. The same stop-start process, however,also means that we can’t date the inception of the tradition to its oldestmanifestations so far found.First, the archaeology is very far from complete, and given the destruction ofso much of the evidence from prehistory, will never be complete—so our abilityto figure out what really happened in the North American past is deeplycompromised. It may be that there was no mound-building at all before 8,000years ago, but it could equally well be that the evidence of an earliermound-building episode has simply been lost.Second, because we are dealing with a system of ideas that has a proven abilityto appear and disappear and reappear again fully formed, we must consider thepossibility that it is such a “reappearance” that the archaeological record hasidentified at the supposed “earliest” mound sites—in other words, that theskills manifest in those already very ancient sites were, as my friend the lateJohn Anthony West used to put it about the civilization of ancient Egypt, “alegacy not a development.”But a legacy of what? And when? And how is it that it keeps on turning up allaround the world, in different places at different times, but always expressingand manifesting the same core ideas?Once again, the ancient Egyptian texts offer some suggestive answers.REBIRTH OF A LOST WORLDTHIS TIME IT’S NOT THE funerary texts I’m referring to, but the Edfu BuildingTexts, so called because they are inscribed on the walls of the Temple of Horusat Edfu in Upper Egypt.These texts take us back to a very remote period called the “Early Primeval Ageof the Gods”59 [part0051.html#note1147]—and these gods, it transpires, were notoriginally Egyptian,60 [part0051.html#note1148] but lived on a sacred island,the “Homeland of the Primeval Ones,” in the midst of a great ocean.61[part0051.html#note1149] Then, at some unspecified time in the past, an immensecataclysm shook the earth and a flood poured over this island, where “theearliest mansions of the gods” had been founded,62 [part0051.html#note1150]destroying it utterly, submerging all its holy places, and killing most of itsdivine inhabitants.63 [part0051.html#note1151] Some survived, however, and weare told that this remnant set sail in their ships (for the texts leave us in nodoubt that these “gods” of the early primeval age were navigators64[part0051.html#note1152]) to “wander” the world.65 [part0051.html#note1153]Their purpose in doing so was nothing less than to re-create and revive theessence of their lost homeland,66 [part0051.html#note1154] to bring about, inshort:The resurrection of the former world of the gods …67 [part0051.html#note1155]The re-creation of a destroyed world.68 [part0051.html#note1156]For those readers not already familiar with the enigma of the Edfu BuildingTexts, and who would like to know more, I give a detailed analysis in my bookMagicians of the Gods. I won’t repeat here the case I made there, nor support itwith the evidence presented there. The takeaway is that the texts invite us toconsider the possibility that the survivors of a lost civilization, thought ofas “gods” but manifestly human, set about “wandering” the world in the aftermathof an extinction-level global cataclysm. By happenstance it was primarilyhunter-gatherer populations, the peoples of the mountains, jungles, anddeserts—“the unlettered and the uncultured,” as Plato so eloquently put it inhis account of the end of Atlantis—who had been “spared the scourge of thedeluge.”69 [part0051.html#note1157] Settling among them, the wanderersentertained the desperate hope that their high civilization could be restarted,or that at least something of its knowledge, wisdom, and spiritual ideas couldbe passed on so that mankind in the post-cataclysmic world would not becompelled to “begin again like children, in complete ignorance of what happenedin early times.”70 [part0051.html#note1158]In this Edfu account of the wandering civilizers am I wrong to be very stronglyreminded of the Tukano origin myth, given in chapter 18? It tells of how“Helmsman” and “Daughter of the Sun” brought the gifts of fire, horticulture,pottery-making, and other skills to the first humans to enter the Amazon whileother “supernaturals” traveled over all the rivers, explored the remote hillranges, identified the best places for settlement, and “prepared the land sothat mortal human creatures might live on it.”Before returning whence they had come these so-called supernaturals:Left their lasting imprint on many spots so that future generations would haveineffaceable proof of their earthly days and would forever remember them andtheir teachings.71 [part0051.html#note1159]These same spots, very frequently marked with petroglyphs, are still held sacredby the Tukano today, anthropologist Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff confirms, as“proof of the divine origin of the cultural heritage, the foundations of whichhad been laid down by the spirit beings who, at that time, still dwelled uponearth.”72 [part0051.html#note1160]Returning to ancient Egypt and to the Edfu texts, we’re told that the survivorsof the Island of the Primeval Ones:journeyed through the … lands of the primeval age. …73 [part0051.html#note1161]In any place in which they settled they founded new sacred domains.74[part0051.html#note1162]We may deduce, therefore, that part of their mission was to repromulgate thelost religion of the days before the flood.Next we learn that architecture, initially in the form of earthen mounds, wasalso central to their mission. Indeed it was so central that they carried withthem a book, The Specifications of the Mounds of the Early Primeval Age, thatliterally “specified” the locations in the Nile Valley upon which every moundwas to be situated, the character and appearance of each mound, and theunderstanding that those first, foundational mounds were to serve as the sitesfor all the temples and pyramids that would be built in Egypt in the future.75[part0051.html#note1163]Little wonder then that included among the company of the “gods” of Edfu werethe Shebtiw, a group of deities charged with a specific responsibility for“creation,”76 [part0051.html#note1164] the “Builder Gods” who accomplished “theactual work of building,”77 [part0051.html#note1165] and the “Seven Sages” who,in addition to dispensing wisdom, as their name suggests, were much involved inthe setting out of structures and in laying foundations.78[part0051.html#note1166]My argument has long been that the Edfu Building Texts reflect real eventssurrounding a real cataclysm that unfolded between 12,800 and 11,600 years ago,a period known to paleoclimatologists as the Younger Dryas and that the Textscall the “Early Primeval Age.” I have proposed that the seeds of what waseventually to become dynastic Egypt were planted in the Nile Valley in thatremote epoch more than 12,000 years ago by the survivors of a lost civilizationand that it was at this time that structures such as the Great Sphinx and itsassociated megalithic temples and the subterranean chamber beneath the GreatPyramid were created. I have further proposed that something resembling areligious cult or monastery, recruiting new initiates down the generations,deploying the memes of geometry and astronomy, disseminating an“as-above-so-below” system of thought, and teaching that eternal annihilationawaited those who did not serve and honor the system, would have been the mostlikely vehicle to carry the ideas of the original founders across the millenniauntil they could be brought to full flower in the Pyramid Age.TURTLE ISLANDIF WE TAKE THE EDFU Building Texts seriously, with their depiction of seafaringmissions sent all around the world to attempt to restart a civilization after aglobal cataclysm, and if ancient Egypt is the distant descendant of one of thosemissions, then we would expect to find other distant descendants elsewhere inthe world.It is my case in this book that we do indeed find such a descendant civilizationin the Mississippi Valley and that, like ancient Egypt, it carries the DNA of a“ghost” civilization of remote prehistory. At sites such as Cahokia andMoundville, and 1,000 years earlier at Newark and High Bank, and 1,000 yearsbefore that at Poverty Point, and again 2,000 years before that at Watson Brake,we see the same sky-ground geometrical and astronomical system at work, withorigins that keep on receding deeper and deeper into the past until the trailfades from view around 8,000 years ago. In the case of the older sites in thiscontinuum—despite early evidence of a special place granted to the constellationOrion across North America79 [part0051.html#note1167]—there is insufficientinformation for us to be sure of the afterlife beliefs of the people who madethem and whether they were linked to the “Path of Souls” complex that we find soamply demonstrated in the later sites. But the fact that such beliefs areconfirmed at Cahokia and Moundville, and other relatively recent Mississippiansites where the archaeological evidence can be enriched with ethnographic data,and the fact that they are also strongly implicated in Hopewell and Adena sitessuch as Newark, High Bank, and Serpent Mound, suggest strongly that the same“cultural package” of sky-ground geometry and astronomy, linked to the same setof beliefs about the afterlife journey of the soul, is likely to have been atwork from the beginning to the end of the mound-building enterprise in NorthAmerica.Then there’s the matter of the Amazon, where earthworks incorporatinggeometrical and astronomical memes identical to those manifested in the ancientNile and Mississippi River Valleys are now emerging from the jungle hand in handwith traditions of “geometrical gods” and evidence of an ancient quest usingvision-inducing plants to gain knowledge of the realm of the dead.At the same time, the whole story of the peopling of the Americas is up forgrabs. We know that the New World has been separated from the Old—a giganticisland—since the epoch of sea-level rise at the end of the Ice Age between12,800 and 11,600 years ago. We know that there were subsequently no significanttransfers of culture or genes between the two regions until about 500 years ago,when the European conquest of the Americas began. We may safely conclude,therefore, that anything held in common culturally or genetically between theOld World and the New that is not the result of mixing in the past 500 years iseither a coincidence or has to date back at least 11,600 years—and could, ofcourse, be far older than that.The extraordinary similarities we’ve considered between ancient Egypt andancient North America are far beyond the power of coincidence to explain and yetthe differences, and the physical and temporal separation of the Nile andMississippi Valley civilizations, mean direct influence also must be ruled out.What’s left is a remote third party—a lost civilization, perhaps even the“island” that the Edfu texts call the Homeland of the Primeval Ones destroyed inthe global cataclysm of 12,800 years ago.North America—“Turtle Island” in Native American tradition—is always, almostautomatically, assumed to be a place to which culture was brought fromelsewhere, but let’s shift the reference frame. What if North America itself wasthe Homeland of the Primeval Ones? What if the distinctive system of ideasinvolving the afterlife journey of the soul and the building of very specifictypes of structures thought to facilitate that journey weren’t brought to NorthAmerica but originated there?Now that the “Clovis First” nonsense has finally been laid to rest we know forsure that humans have been in the Americas for at least 25,000 years, withcompelling evidence for an even earlier presence 50,000 years ago or more.Indeed if, Tom Deméré and his team have correctly read the clues at the CeruttiMastodon Site, the real First Americans may have inhabited the New World—as farsouth as San Diego—as much as 130,000 years ago.Even if the continent wasn’t inhabited until 25,000 years ago, however, we’restill left with an immense span of time before the earliest evidence ofmound-building in North America around 8,000 years ago. That’s an interval quitelong enough for great innovations in human culture to have occurred, yet if theydid occur, why do we find no trace of them?We’ve already seen, and I think there’s no dispute about it, that a vastheritage of truth about Native American cultures, and what they really knew andbelieved, was utterly obliterated by the European conquest in the past 500years. That’s one reason why the record is so patchy, with great chunks simplymissing.The second reason, as Tom Deméré explained (see part 2[part0012.html#BE6O0-6d489586c24d4bc6a7d8fba43c80bb24]), is that archaeologistshave, until recently, been unwilling to investigate older deposits because of apreexisting conviction that nothing would be found in them.But there’s a third factor that may prove to be of far greater significance thanthe other two, and this has to do with the extinction-level cataclysm that theearth experienced 12,800 years ago. Although the entire globe was affected, allthe evidence indicates that the epicenter was in North America. It’s giant icecap, 2 kilometers deep and extending in that epoch as far south as Minnesota,was massively destabilized, and the destruction that followed was near totalacross an immense area where the archaeological record was effectively sweptclean.What happened in North America?"},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00138.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00139.jpeg]ELOISEIT’S EARLY OCTOBER 2017, A roasting-hot midmorning, and we’ve just left Tucson,Arizona, for the 80-mile drive to Murray Springs, a very rich and complex Clovissite about 14 miles southwest of the town of Tombstone and 20 miles north of theMexican border. Our route takes us via I-10 and AZ-90 through increasingly serescrub and semidesert under a merciless sky, but when we arrive at Murray Springsitself, park, say hello to the rangers at the gate, and walk the couple of milesof the trail around the archaeological site we find ourselves in a sort of oasiswith abundant mesquite growing tall enough along the edges of a sinuous arroyo—aflood channel—to offer some welcome shade. Although flash floods still ripthrough here from time to time it’s rumored that the present lush environmentowes more to treated sewage being dumped in the area.Santha and I are accompanied by geophysicist Allen West and his wife, Nancy.Working with Jim Kennett, an earth scientist and oceanographer at the Universityof California, and Richard Firestone, a nuclear analytical chemist at LawrenceBerkeley National Laboratory, West is one of the principal investigators in aloose alliance of more than sixty scientists from many different fields who havejoined forces since 2007 to try to solve a profound mystery. It concerns theYounger Dryas, the interlude of cataclysmic global climate change coincidingwith the Late Pleistocene Extinction Event in which thirty-five genera of NorthAmerican megafauna (with each genus consisting of several species) were wipedout around 12,800 years ago. Sharing their fate were the Clovis people and theirdistinctive culture with its characteristic “fluted-point” weaponry.We climb down to the floor of the arroyo, which is about 2 meters deep and 12meters wide at this point, and begin to walk along it. After a few moments Allenstops. “It’s around here that they excavated Eloise,” he says. He’s referring toone of the mammoths ambushed and butchered at Murray Springs by the Clovispeople some 12,800 years ago. He describes how Eloise’s skeleton was foundintact except for the hind legs, which had been chopped off right after she waskilled. One was moved up and placed alongside her head. Archaeologists found theother a few hundred meters away, close to the residue of an ancient campfire.Part of a broken Clovis point was also found by the campfire, while the rest ofit was “in Eloise.”The archaeologist who excavated the mammoth in the 1960s, and who would bringAllen West and Richard Firestone to the site many years later, was Vance Haynes,Regents Professor Emeritus at the University of Arizona and a senior member ofthe National Academy of Sciences. The reader will recall that his adamantdefense of “Clovis First” was a significant factor in extending the life of thatnow thoroughly discredited theory and in inhibiting other research indicating amuch earlier peopling of the Americas.As the discoverer and principal excavator of Murray Springs, however, Haynesdeserves credit for drawing attention to a very curious aspect of the site—adistinct dark layer of soil draped “like shrink-wrap,” as Allen West puts it,over the top of the Clovis remains and of the extinct megafauna—includingEloise.Haynes has identified this “black mat” (his term) not only at Murray Springs butat dozens of other sites across North America,1 [part0051.html#note1168] and wasthe first to acknowledge its clear and obvious association with the LatePleistocene Extinction Event. He speaks of the “remarkable circumstances”surrounding the event, the abrupt die-off on a continental scale of all largemammals “immediately before deposition of the … black mat,” and the totalabsence thereafter of “mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, dire wolf, Americanlion, tapir and other [megafauna], as well as Clovis people.”2[part0051.html#note1169]Haynes notes also that “The basal black mat contact marks a major climate changefrom the warm dry climate of the terminal Allerød to the glacially cold YoungerDryas.”3 [part0051.html#note1170]From roughly 18,000 years ago, and for several thousand years thereafter, globaltemperatures had been slowly but steadily rising and the ice sheets melting. Ourancestors would have had reason to hope that earth’s long winter was at lastcoming to an end and that a new era of congenial climate beckoned. This processof warming became particularly pronounced after about 14,500 years ago. Thensuddenly, around 12,800 years ago, the direction of climate change reversed andthe world turned dramatically, instantly cold—as cold as it had been at the peakof the Ice Age many thousands of years earlier. This deep freeze—the mysteriousepoch now known as the Younger Dryas—lasted for approximately 1,200 years until11,600 years ago, at which point the climate flipped again, global temperaturesshot up rapidly, the remnant ice sheets melted and collapsed into the oceans,and the world became as warm as it is today.4 [part0051.html#note1171]In addition to Murray Springs, Vance Haynes reports finding:At least 40 other localities in the United States with Younger Dryas age blackmat deposits. … 5 [part0051.html#note1172] This layer or mat covers theClovis-age landscape or surface on which the last remnants of the terminalPleistocene megafauna are recorded. Stratigraphically and chronologically theextinction appears to have been catastrophic, seemingly too sudden and extensivefor either human predation or climate change to have been the primary cause.This sudden … termination … appears to have coincided with the sudden climaticswitch from Allerød warming to Younger Dryas cooling. Recent evidence forextraterrestrial impact, although not yet compelling, needs further testingbecause a remarkable perturbation occurred … that needs to be explained.6[part0051.html#note1173]Haynes published these thoughts in the Proceedings of the National Academy ofSciences in May 2008. The “extraterrestrial” impact that he mentions (and finds“not yet compelling”) has nothing to do with “aliens” but refers to a seriousscientific theory, the “Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis,” that had received itsfirst formal airing—also in PNAS—in October 2007.7 [part0051.html#note1174] Thepaper was coauthored by Allen West, Richard Firestone, James Kennett, and morethan twenty other scientists and presents evidence that multiple fragments of agiant comet—a swarm of fragments—struck the earth with disastrous consequencesaround 12,800 years ago. The effects were global but the epicenter of thecataclysm was over the North American ice cap, which the impacts destabilized,triggering the Younger Dryas deep freeze and the megafaunal extinctions.8[part0051.html#note1175]Haynes was right to say, in 2008, that this radical hypothesis needed furthertesting. It would receive it in the years ahead and become the focus of afurious debate that has divided scientists and continues to this day. On oneside, many highly qualified and experienced specialists from many differentfields are convinced that a comet swarm was indeed encountered around 12,800years ago and that the result was a global catastrophe, with its most extremeeffects felt in North America. On the other side is a smaller but more vocal andhighly influential group of skeptics who reject the theory. I reported thedebate between the two factions in some detail in my book Magicians of the Godsso won’t repeat myself here. As I write these words in 2018, and despite adecade of unrelenting criticism and focused attempts at refutation, the upshotis that the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis [YDIH] has stood the test of time,gained increasingly wide acceptance among scientists, and remains by far thebest single, coherent explanation for the cataclysmic events and extinctions—the“remarkable perturbation”—that did indeed occur around 12,800 ago.Allen West is at the cutting edge of the research into this colossal mystery andthe coauthor of more than forty scientific papers looking into it in depth.I’m privileged to have him join me at Murray Springs.BLACK MATALLEN LEADS US OVER TO the side wall of the arroyo, explaining, as we walk, thatthe area would have had a very different appearance 12,800 years ago. Inparticular it would have been “much wetter,” with “a string of lakes” serving aswatering holes for the megafauna that the Clovis hunters came here to kill. Thearroyo itself is a relatively recent feature but a useful one because it slicesvertically through a couple of meters of sediment laid down before and after theonset of the Younger Dryas and thus functions something like an archaeologicaltrench, revealing the layers—and what’s in them—stacked one on top of the other.A distinct black stratum, running horizontally like a layer in a cake, isvisible on both walls of the arroyo about a meter below present ground level. Itobviously lies across the whole landscape and has been exposed here by the flashfloods that cut the arroyo—as though, to extend the analogy, a “slice” of thecake has been removed, allowing us a glimpse of its interior.The stratum is about a hand’s-breadth thick.“That’s the black mat,” Allen confirms.It doesn’t look like a cataclysm, but appearances can be deceptive.The first and most obvious sign of an impact by an asteroid or comet is acrater—or multiple craters in the case of a swarm. However, the earth’s surfaceis dynamic and craters can be obliterated by erosion or other geologicalprocesses, or covered over by later sediments or submerged by rising sea levels.In the case of impacts on the 2-kilometer-deep North American ice cap, asenvisaged in the YDIH, the craters would have been excavated in ice that wouldhave subsequently melted away, leaving little or no evidence on the groundbeneath.Scientists have therefore developed other measures, more subtle than looking forcraters, to detect cosmic impacts in the geological record. Nanodiamonds, forexample, are microscopic diamonds that form under rare conditions of greatshock, pressure, and heat, and are recognized as being among the characteristicfingerprints—“proxies” in scientific language—of powerful impacts by comets orasteroids.9 [part0051.html#note1176] Other proxies include meltglass (resemblingtrinitite), tiny carbon spherules that form when molten droplets cool rapidly inair, magnetic microspherules, charcoal, soot, platinum, carbon moleculescontaining the rare isotope helium-3, and magnetic grains with iridium.10[part0051.html#note1177]Certain of the glassy and metallic proxies require temperatures in excess of2,200 degrees C to form and there is nothing in nature other than the heat andshock of a cosmic impact that can instantly generate such temperatures.11[part0051.html#note1178] Alternative explanations might be offered for some ofthe other proxies but when they occur together, and in abundance, a cosmicimpact again fits the evidence better than anything else.12[part0051.html#note1179]Moreover, to this day, scientists know of only two layers of sediment “broadlydistributed across several continents that exhibit coeval abundance peaks in acomprehensive assemblage of cosmic impact markers, including nanodiamonds,high-temperature quenched spherules, high-temperature melt-glass, carbonspherules, iridium and aciniform carbon.”13 [part0051.html#note1180]These layers are found at the Cretaceous-Paleogene Boundary 65 million yearsago, when it has long been agreed that a gigantic cosmic impact in the Gulf ofMexico caused the mass extinction of the dinosaurs, and at the Younger DryasBoundary 12,800 years ago.14 [part0051.html#note1181]I have a question for Allen. “Since the black mat was found draped directly ontop of Eloise—like ‘shrink-wrap,’ you said—then presumably it must have begun toform very shortly after she was killed and butchered with most of her remainsleft lying on the spot?”“What we see is that at the bottom of that black-mat layer, literally the firstthing touching those bones, are spherules, iridium, platinum, and small piecesof melt-glass from the event. So it doesn’t mean the animal was alive when theevent happened, but she had to have been alive very, very shortly, at most a fewweeks, before it.”I ask Allen to explain the black mat to me. “I understand that the lowest partof it is full of impact proxies laid down at the time the mat began to form butclearly they’re not the mat itself …”“The black mat formed on top of the layer of proxies,” Allen replies. “Down hereit has a lot of charcoal in it. But it also has algal remains so it’s not justfire. The Younger Dryas changed the climate and made the area much wetter. Algaebegan to grow along the edges of the lakes.” He puts a hand on the black stripealong the arroyo wall: “So the remains of about 1,000 years of dead algae,charcoal, and a lot of other stuff are all embedded in here, and at the bottomof it, where the impact happened, we find iridium, platinum, and a layer ofmelted spherules where the temperatures must have been so high that they wouldhave melted a modern car into a pool of metal.”“So are you saying that there was an impact right here? At Murray Springs?”Allen replies that it’s not as simple as that. “The bigger impacts were farthernorth. Down here it’s more likely to have been an airburst—a fragment of thecomet that literally blew up in the sky before hitting the ground …”“And the effect of that would have been … what?”“If you’d been standing here it would have seemed like the whole sky caught onfire with the center of it brighter than the sun. And the thing is it would havebeen totally silent. They would have heard nothing at first. Because the speedof sound is a lot slower than the speed of light.”My imagination has gone into overdrive. “Could it have happened,” I ask, “whilethe Clovis hunters were actually butchering Eloise?”Allen shakes his head. “We know it didn’t happen instantaneously,” he remindsme, “because they chopped her legs off and hauled one of them away and cookedit. But it could have happened later the same day and like I say it certainlyhappened within a couple of weeks. That’s based on modern data from elephantkills in Africa. The scavengers come in quickly and disarticulate the skeleton,and that didn’t happen with Eloise.”This kill site sounds like unfinished business to me.“That other haunch left up by Eloise’s head,” I reflect, “and the rest of herintact. Doesn’t that suggest that the hunters were still in the vicinity andmeant to come back to finish butchering her, but for some reason never did?”Allen joins in with the spirit of the thought. “Okay,” he says. “It’s purespeculation, obviously, because we’ll never know for sure the exact sequence ofevents here 12,800 years ago, but based on the evidence it’s not unreasonable toenvisage the hunters sitting around, cooking mammoth haunch over their campfirewhen all of a sudden the sky explodes …”“And that’s why they never go back for the rest of Eloise? Because they’re alldead?”“Could be,” Alan agrees. He jabs a finger into the base of the black mat andcontinues.“But what we can be certain of was that this moment marked the end of theirstory, and the end of an epoch, really. There’s not a single Clovis point foundanywhere in North America that’s above that black mat. They’re all in it orbelow it. And there’s not a single mammoth skeleton anywhere in North Americathat’s above it. A huge part of the die-off could have been as a direct resultof the impacts themselves, but impacts and airbursts south of the ice cap,particularly as far south as New Mexico, would also have set off wildfires.There’s overwhelming evidence that gigantic wildfires raged at the onset of theYounger Dryas—in fact, more soot has been found at the Younger Dryas Boundarythan at the Cretaceous-Paleogene Boundary. We did the calculations and it lookslike as much as 25 percent of the edible biomass and around 9 percent of thetotal biomass of the planet was on fire and destroyed within days or weeks ofthe YDB. So in many areas if the animals weren’t killed outright they wouldn’thave been able to forage enough food afterwards to survive. The grass would haveburned up, leaves on trees were gone. … And you know, the other thing is thatwhen comet fragments come in they’re traveling incredibly fast and theyliterally punch a hole in the atmosphere. They actually push the air aside andthey bring in that super cold from space, and when they explode in the air thatcold plume continues to the ground and you literally have things frozen in placeif they were close enough to where the plume came down. It’s possible they werefried and then frozen all within a matter of seconds.”MULTIPLE INJECTIONS OF PLATINUMI ASK ALLEN HOW LONG, in his opinion, the multiple impacts that kicked off theYounger Dryas were sustained for. Was it an overnight affair? Was it a matter ofdays? Was it weeks?He replies that there are levels of uncertainty, variables that will probablynever be properly resolved, but that within those limits what the evidencepoints to is not days or weeks but a 21-year period of utter devastation,horror, and cataclysm unfolding between 12,836 years ago and 12,815 years ago,with a peak around 12,822 years ago.This ability to zoom in at very high resolution on a time window just 21 yearswide and almost 13,000 years in the past comes to us courtesy of an amazingscientific resource consisting of ice cores from Greenland. Extracted withtubular drills that can reach depths of more than 3 kilometers, these corespreserve an unbroken 100,000-year record of any environmental and climaticevents anywhere around the globe that affected the Greenland ice cap. What theyshow, and what Allen is referring to, is a mysterious spike in the metallicelement platinum—“a 21-year interval with elevated platinum,” as he puts itnow—“so we know that was the length of the impact event because there’s verylittle way, once platinum falls on the ice sheet, that it can move around. It’spretty well locked in place.”The backup to what Allen’s saying is in a paper I’m already familiar with byMichail Petaev of Harvard University’s Department of Earth and PlanetarySciences and his colleagues Shichun Huang, Stein Jacobsen, and Alan Zindler.Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in August 2013,the self-explanatory title of the paper is “Large Pt Anomaly in the GreenlandIce Core Points to a Cataclysm at the Onset of Younger Dryas.”Platinum is, of course, an element found on earth, but analysis of the platinumin the ice core by Petaev and his colleagues reveals a composition quite unliketerrestrial platinum and leads the scientists to conclude that “anextraterrestrial source,” perhaps “a metal impactor with an unusualcomposition,” is the most likely explanation.15 [part0051.html#note1182] Theynote also that during the 21-year interval—between 12,836 and 12,815 years ago,as indicated by Allen:The Pt concentrations gradually rise by at least 100-fold over ~14 y and dropback during the subsequent ~7 y. … The observed gradual ingrowth of the Ptconcentration in ice over ~14 y may suggest multiple injections of Pt-rich dustinto the stratosphere.16 [part0051.html#note1183]Allen’s reading of what Petaev’s findings point to, shared widely by hiscolleagues, is that the “impactor” was in fact multiple impactors, all of themfragments of a comet that had wandered in from the outer solar system and takenup a potentially deadly earth-crossing orbit.Though bound together by ice, comets have rocky cores that are often volatile,and it is in the nature of these cores to undergo fragmentation. Take CometShoemaker-Levy 9, for example. It broke apart into twenty-one fragments, all ofwhich smashed into the planet Jupiter over a period of 6 days in July 1994 withspectacular effect, creating huge, fiery explosions and dark scars, in somecases larger than the earth, that persisted on the surface of the gas giant formany months.Something of the same sort is involved in Allen’s vision, again widely shared byhis colleagues, of what happened to the earth at the Younger Dryas Boundary.Drawing also on the work of William Napier, professor of astrobiology at theUniversity of Cardiff, what the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis proposes, inbrief, is a large parent comet in the range of 100 kilometers in diameter.Plunging in from the outer solar system, it enters an earth-crossing orbitaround 30,000 years ago and remains intact for the next 10,000 years. About20,000 years ago, due to gravitational forces in the inner solar system itundergoes a massive “fragmentation event” that transforms it from a singledeadly and potentially world-killing object into multiple objects varying indiameter from the extremely dangerous kilometer-plus range down to a few tens ofmeters, down to chunks the size of cars, down to boulder-sized pieces, down tofist-sized rubble, and down beyond that to countless billions of smallerfragments and an immense penumbra of dust. As thousands of years pass, the wholeturbulent mass of big and little pieces of the comet orbiting at tens ofthousands of kilometers per hour begins to separate into multiple filaments eachfilled with debris, eventually expanding to form a giant tubular “meteor stream”some 30 million kilometers in diameter and extending more than 300 millionkilometers across the entire orbit of the earth—which it cuts in two places sothat we must pass through the stream twice a year. Traveling 2.5 millionkilometers along its orbital path every day, the earth takes 12 days to completeeach passage through the stream.17 [part0051.html#note1184]Image Missing [../images/00140.jpeg]The Taurid Meteor Stream. Remnant of a giant comet 100+ kilometers in diameter,before undergoing fragmentation. The stream includes three known comets orcomet-like objects, namely: Enke, Oljiato, and Rudnicki, and nineteen of thebrightest near-earth objects.Because the meteor stream produces showers of “shooting stars” that look toobservers on the ground as though they originate in the region of the skyoccupied by the constellation Taurus, it’s called the Taurid meteor stream. Ourplanet still passes through it twice a year, negotiating its dangerous innerfilaments in late June and early July (when shooting stars are not visiblebecause they are encountered in daylight) and again from late October intoNovember, when a spectacular “Halloween fireworks” display is put on.18[part0051.html#note1185]On most of these biannual encounters with the Taurids we just get the prettyfireworks, but occasionally we get more. On June 30, 1908, for example, anobject thought to have fallen out of the Taurid meteor stream,19[part0051.html#note1186] and estimated to be somewhere between 60 and 190 metersin diameter, penetrated earth’s atmosphere. It exploded in the air—fortunatelyabove an uninhabited region of Siberia—flattening 80 million trees across anarea of 2,000 square kilometers. To put this in context, Greater London has anarea of 1,582 square kilometers and a population of more than 7 million people.“If transferred to London,” Professor Napier calculates, the Tunguska airburst:would have been heard throughout the UK, north to Denmark and across Europe asfar as Switzerland. Topsoil would have been stripped from fields in the north ofEngland, people in Oxford would have been thrown through the air and severelyburned, an incandescent column of matter would have been thrown 20 km in the airover London, and the city itself would have been destroyed about as far out asthe present-day ring road. Impact energy estimates range from 3 to 12.5 Mt(megatons TNT equivalent).20 [part0051.html#note1187]The consequences if an object of similar size were to explode over a major citytoday would, in other words, be utterly catastrophic, but because the Tunguskaevent took place in a remote region before the era of modern masscommunications, very few people are aware of how deadly even relatively smallchunks of space rock can be.Professor Napier and his colleague Victor Clube, formerly dean of theAstrophysics Department at Oxford University, go so far as to describe the“unique complex of debris” within the Taurid stream as “the greatest collisionhazard facing the earth at the present time.”21 [part0051.html#note1188]Coordination of their findings with those of Allen West, Jim Kennett, andRichard Firestone, has led both teams—the geophysicists and the astronomers—toconclude that it was very likely objects from the then much younger Tauridmeteor stream that hit the earth around 12,800 years ago and caused the onset ofthe Younger Dryas. These objects, orders of magnitude larger than the one thatexploded over Tunguska, contained extraterrestrial platinum, and what theevidence from the Greenland ice cores seems to indicate is an epoch of 21 yearsin which the earth was hit every year, with the bombardments increasing annuallyin intensity until the fourteenth year, when they peaked and then began todecline before ceasing in the twenty-first year.Image Missing [../images/00141.jpeg]Tunguska—an airburst at an altitude of 5–6 kilometers. The object was estimatedto have had a diameter of between 60 and 190 meters. It flattened 80 milliontrees across an area of more than 2,000 square kilometers. This is an arealarger than London. Had the event occurred over a major city, rather than overan uninhabited area, the loss of life would have been horrendous. PHOTOS: LEONIDKULIK.“It’s as though after dodging the bullet for thousands of years,” I say to Allenas we walk back along the baking floor of the arroyo, “the earth finallyintersects a particularly lumpy and rocky filament of debris and we get hitreally hard, over and over again, year after year, until we’ve passed throughit.”“Petaev himself says ‘multiple injections of platinum,’” Allen reminds me. “Ithink those were pretty much his exact words in the paper, so that’s anindependent assessment of the idea. There’s something else, too, from newresearch we’ve been working on. In the ice core, at the exact same moment we seethis big onset of platinum at the beginning of the 21 years, we also see asudden rise in dust.”Image Missing [../images/00142.jpeg]The Younger Dryas Boundary strewn field. The area enclosed by the dotted linedefines the current known limits of the YDB field of cosmic impact proxiesspanning more than 50 million square kilometers.“Which tells you what?”“Which tells us that along with everything else that was going on at the timethere were also very high winds blowing. There are certain proxies of thatwindiness that end up in the ice sheet. When it’s windier the winds will pick upcontinental dust, and, number one, it’s colder so there’s less plant cover, sowhen it gets windier and there are less plants to hold the sediment down, youget huge dust storms. We can see that buildup in the Greenland ice sheet. We seemagnesium and calcium, a huge increase in them, and those are indicative ofterrigenous dust, continental dust, and we see an increase in sodium andchlorine which are from sea salt—so the winds are so strong they pick up moresea salt and deposit it in Greenland. The levels of these windiness proxiescontinue to climb for nearly 100 years. At the same time we see one of thebiggest peaks in the entire ice core in all the biomass-burning proxies, andthose occur within less than a 10-year window of the start of that 21-yearinterval—so you look at that and the best explanation is the impact occurred,that it triggered immense biomass burning, and that it changed the climateradically, resulting in high winds and immense dust storms.”“So it was a combination of really horrible things?”“A cascade of bad things. It must have felt like the end of the world for thosewho lived through it.”“And particularly bad here in North America—the epicenter of the disaster?”“Much worse here than anywhere else! A true calamity. But it wasn’t only NorthAmerica. We’ve traced evidence of further impacts from the same swarm in theexact same period in Europe and as far east as Syria and even into SouthAmerica. The strewn field extends across more than 50 million square kilometersof the earth’s surface.”NEW EVIDENCEI HAVE WRITTEN EXTENSIVELY ABOUT the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis inMagicians of the Gods. There I present evidence that the impacts changed theworld completely and wiped from the record almost all traces not only of theClovis people but also of an advanced civilization of the Ice Age.The fact that North America was the epicenter of the cataclysm, thoughacknowledged, has profound implications for our understanding of the human pastthat archaeologists have never thought through—in part because the scale of thecataclysm is only now beginning to be fully mapped out.After completing Magicians, therefore, I made sure I stayed up to date with thesteady stream of new evidence released by Allen and his group in the scientificjournals. There was a visible quickening in the pace of the research, and in2017 and 2018 two major studies revealed how truly devastating the cataclysm atthe onset of the Younger Dryas really was.If there was ever a time when a significant chapter in the story of humancivilization could have been lost, this, surely, was it."},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00143.jpeg]FIRE AND ICEALLEN WEST AND THE TEAM of scientists working on the Younger Dryas ImpactHypothesis established themselves as a formal research organization, the CometResearch Group, in 2015.1 [part0051.html#note1189] The group (hereafter CRG)presently numbers sixty-three leading scientists from fifty-five universities insixteen countries.2 [part0051.html#note1190] Many other scientists are alsodirectly and indirectly associated as coauthors of papers written by CRGmembers.This is the case with a paper, published in Nature’s sister journal ScientificReports on March 9, 2017, titled “Widespread Platinum Anomaly Documented at theYounger Dryas Onset in North American Sedimentary Sequences.”3[part0051.html#note1191]The lead author is geoarchaeologist and CRG member Dr. Christopher Moore of theUniversity of South Carolina. His coauthors and fellow CRG members aregeophysicist Allen West, whom we met in the last chapter, anthropologistRandolph Daniel of East Carolina University, archaeologist Albert Goodyear, whomwe met in chapter 6, earth scientist James P. Kennett of the University ofCalifornia, geologist Kenneth B. Tankersley of the University of Cincinnati, andgeologist Ted Bunch of Northern Arizona University.

Ivester of the University of West Georgia,luminescence-dating expert James K. Feathers of the University of Washington,and physicist Victor Adedji of Elizabeth City State University.4[part0051.html#note1192]All in all, therefore, a very distinguished assembly of scientists—and the taskthat they set themselves was also in the finest tradition of good science,namely, to test an important prediction made by other scientists. From theprevious chapter, the reader will recall the research by Michail Petaev and hiscolleagues showing elevated levels of platinum in the Greenland ice cores over a21-year period between 12,836 and 12,815 years ago. Petaev reports what appearto have been “multiple injections” of platinum-rich dust into the stratosphereover this period and predicts that if the source of the dust was cometary,asteroidal, or meteoroidal, then the fallout should have extended far beyondGreenland and would be “expected to result in a global Pt anomaly.”5[part0051.html#note1193]The coauthors of the 2017 platinum paper chose North America, the suspectedepicenter of the Younger Dryas cataclysm—and also their home turf—to test thisprediction by establishing “whether or not a Pt anomaly exists in terrestrialsediments of YD age that is similar to that reported from the GISP2 ice core.”6[part0051.html#note1194]It sounds low-key, but much was at stake. If soil samples showed platinum to beat normal background levels in the YDB layer across North America, then Petaev’sprediction would be false and the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis would sufferserious collateral damage. On the other hand, if elevated levels of platinumwere found, it would vindicate Petaev and give further strong support to thehypothesis that cosmic impacts caused the Younger Dryas cataclysm.Eleven archaeological sites—see map below—all with good stratification andwell-established YD-age sediments were selected as the focus of the study: 1.Arlington Canyon, Santa Rosa Island, California; 2. Murray Springs, Arizona; 3.Blackwater Draw, New Mexico; 4. Sheriden Cave, Ohio; 5. Squires Ridge, NorthCarolina; 6. Barber Creek, North Carolina; 7. Kolb, South Carolina; 8. FlamingoBay, South Carolina; 9. Pen Point, South Carolina; 10 Topper, South Carolina;and 11. Johns Bay, South Carolina.Image Missing [../images/00144.jpeg]The project began by testing soil samples from Arlington Canyon, Murray Springs,Blackwater Draw, and Sheriden Cave, four sites with particularly “well-definedand well-dated YDB age sediments containing peaks in YDB impact-relatedproxies.”7 [part0051.html#note1195] What the tests revealed was:a large above-background Pt anomaly at each site in the identical samplepreviously identified as the YD boundary layer containing abundance peaks in YDBproxies, including micro-spherules, meltglass, and nanodiamonds.8[part0051.html#note1196]The team then extended the Pt analysis to soil samples from the seven othersites. In summary, across all eleven sites, they conclude that their resultsprovide strong evidence for above-background enrichment in Pt within sedimentsthat date to the onset of YD climate change at ~12,800 Cal B.P. Pt abundancesfrom our study sites averaged 6.0 parts per billion (ppb) … compared tobackground abundances above and below the YDB layer averaging 0.3 ppb. Averagebackground Pt concentrations are all lower than crustal abundance of 0.5 ppb,whereas average YDB concentrations are 12× higher. These concentrations are alsohigher than the peak Pt concentration (~80 parts per trillion [ppt] or 0.1 ppb)reported at high chronological resolution from the GISP2 ice-core in Greenlandby Petaev et al. All study sites contain significant Pt peaks that are ~3 to 66×higher than in Greenland.9 [part0051.html#note1197]The technical language and abbreviations make it difficult to stay focused onthe grave implications of all this. In a layer in the earth that alreadycontains abundant evidence of a cataclysmic cosmic impact around 12,800 yearsago, a mass of new corroborative evidence has now been discovered. In parallel,the much greater strength of the Pt signal in the United States than inGreenland joins multiple other indicators pointing to North America as the mostseverely affected locus of the cataclysm. If this were a homicide investigationin which the prosecution were hesitating to charge the suspect, new evidence ofthis quality would be decisive, and a winnable case could be brought to court.Moore and his colleagues are cautious and modest, however, claiming only that:the consistent presence of anomalous Pt concentrations within sediments frommultiple archaeological sites across North America that date to the onset of theYD Chronozone is compelling. … This study finds no evidence to contradict theconclusions of Petaev et al. that the Greenland Pt enrichment most likelyresulted from an extraterrestrial source. … In addition, our findings show nocontradiction with the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.10[part0051.html#note1198]After completing their own investigation, Moore et al. combed the scientificliterature for indications of how far beyond North America and Greenland the YDBplatinum anomaly extends. Though not central to any investigation prior toPetaev’s, they found that platinum group elements had been discovered andmentioned in passing in other earlier studies of the Younger Dryas Boundary atlocations as far afield as Belgium, the central Pacific, Venezuela, thesouthwest of England, and the Netherlands—“important information,” hinting at atruly global picture, that they hope “may encourage further research.”11[part0051.html#note1199]In the Supplementary Information to their main paper, Moore and his colleaguesalso provide detailed evidence ruling out either volcanic activity or processesin the mantle of the earth as the sources for the enriched platinum at theYDB.12 [part0051.html#note1200] By contrast, after compiling geochemical datafor 167 meteorites, including chondrites, achondrites, irons, and ureilites,they found very high average Pt abundances, “making all four classes ofmeteorites possible sources of YDB Pt enrichment.”13 [part0051.html#note1201]They also note, “If a Pt-rich meteorite or comet impacted Earth, the targetrocks would have become a melted mix of meteoritic and terrestrial material, andso should be Pt-enriched.”14 [part0051.html#note1202]The coauthors therefore compiled geochemical data from eighty-six examples ofsuch “impactites” from three major impact layers spread out over a period ofmore than two billion years. In every one of them they found elevated Ptabundances in a range including all the values in the Pt-rich YDB layers fromaround 12,800 years ago.15 [part0051.html#note1203]FOLLOWING THE TRAIL OF CLUESTHE CORROBORATING EVIDENCE KEEPS COMING in.When we met at Murray Springs in October 2017, Allen West told me about new CRGresearch that had identified an extended episode of extreme windiness,dustiness, and large-scale “biomass burning” at the onset of the Younger Dryas.He mentioned that “around 9 percent of the total biomass of the planet was onfire and destroyed within days or weeks of the YDB”—an astonishing statement—butI’d been so focused on other aspects of what he was saying that I hadn’t reallyconsidered the implications.In February 2018 the Journal of Geology published the massive two-part study onwhich Allen’s off-the-cuff remarks were based. The title speaks for itself:“Extraordinary Biomass-Burning Episode and Impact Winter Triggered by theYounger Dryas Cosmic Impact ~12,800 Years Ago.”16 [part0051.html#note1204] CRGmember Wendy Wolbach, professor of inorganic chemistry, geochemistry, andanalytical chemistry at Chicago’s De Paul University, led the study, in whichshe was joined by Allen West and twenty-five other top researchers.17[part0051.html#note1205]Confirmation of the figure of 9 percent of terrestrial biomass comes on thefirst page, with the calculation that this would have meant that plant mattercovering an area of no less than 10 million square kilometers would have beenconsumed by the inferno.18 [part0051.html#note1206]To imagine a world in which 10 million square kilometers of vegetation is inflames is to imagine a world in which an area roughly twice the size of theAmazon rainforest is burning. That would be about the same as the entire area ofChina or the entire area of Europe or the entire area of North America inflames.No matter how many separate wildfires there were, or how spread around theplanet, a conflagration on this scale, hand in hand with the cascade of otherdisasters that marked the onset of the Younger Dryas, can only be described ashell on earth.Once again, although records from lake sediments also provide vital clues, it isthe Greenland ice cores, together with ice cores from other Arctic regions, thatcontain decisive evidence of the large-scale wildfires that raged across theworld 12,800 years ago. This is not least because the upper (i.e., most recent)levels of these extremely long cores contain the traces of biomass wildfiresthat occurred and were recorded in the historic period, thus allowingidentification and calibration of specific combustion aerosols, notably oxalate,ammonium, nitrate, acetate, formate, and levoglucosan, that serve as distinctsignals—or proxies—of biomass-burning.19 [part0051.html#note1207] Wherever anabundance of these combustion aerosols shows up in the ice cores we can becertain that they mark the atmospheric fallout from extensive wildfires, we candate those wildfires, and it is often possible to identify where on the planetthey occurred.Here are some important pieces of the Younger Dryas puzzle winnowed from thedense pages of the 2018 paper: * GISP2 Ice Core: Ammonium (NH4), a biomass-burning proxy, displays one of the highest peaks in the 120,000-year record in an interval dating to 12,830–12,828 years ago. This overlaps the platinum-rich interval dating to 12,836–12,815 years ago and coincides with the onset of the Younger Dryas.20 [part0051.html#note1208] * NGRIP Ice Core: A single high NH4 peak, traced to biomass burning across North America, begins at the YD onset. It is the largest biomass-burning episode from North American sources in the entire record.21 [part0051.html#note1209] * The GRIP concentrations of combustion aerosols began to increase sharply around 12,816 years ago, correlating with the GISP2 Pt anomaly (12,836–12,815 years ago). At the onset of the Younger Dryas, concentrations of oxalate and formate reached their highest known concentrations in the ~386,000-year core, with acetate abundances ranking among the highest in the entire core.22 [part0051.html#note1210] * These GRIP data reveal that massive wildfires occurred at the onset of the Younger Dryas, representing the most anomalous episode of biomass burning in at least 120,000 years and possibly in the past ~386,000 years.23 [part0051.html#note1211] * The Taylor Dome (Antarctica) ice-core record exhibits a small but distinct peak in NO3 that closely correlates with the Younger Dryas onset. The base of the Belukha, Siberia, ice core exhibits a major peak in NO3 [nitrate], indicating that a major episode of biomass burning occurred at the Younger Dryas onset.24 [part0051.html#note1212] * Several ice-core sequences (GISP2, NGRIP, GRIP, Taylor Dome and Belukha) confirm that the onset of the Younger Dryas was intimately associated with one of the highest and most pervasive late Quaternary peaks in each of NH4, NO3, formate, oxalate, and acetate. These peaks occurred synchronously with the abrupt cooling and other climatic effects marking the onset of the Younger Dryas episode.25 [part0051.html#note1213] * Investigation of “black mats” at nineteen sites in North America, Central America, Europe, and the Middle East: Peak abundances of black carbon (BC)/soot and other biomass-burning proxies were found in the Younger Dryas Boundary layers. … Concentrations of levoglucosan from within the black-mat layer in Ohio were around 125 times higher than those in the layer below it, signalling a significant peak in biomass burning.26 [part0051.html#note1214] * Analysis of charcoal in lake sediments from nine countries in South and Central America: One of the highest peaks in the record occurs at the Younger Dryas onset around 12,850 years ago.27 [part0051.html#note1215] * Analysis of charcoal in lake sediments from seven countries across Asia: There is a conspicuous peak in mean charcoal abundances at around 12,950 years ago (plus or minus 225 years) … followed by a sharp decline in biomass burning and then a peak at 12,400 years ago.28 [part0051.html#note1216] * A 24,000-year sequence recorded in a marine core from the Santa Barbara Basin, off the coast of California, exhibits the highest peak in biomass burning precisely at the onset of the Younger Dryas. … This anomalously high peak correlates with intense biomass burning documented from the nearby Channel Islands. … The peak also coincides with the extinction of pygmy mammoths on the islands and with the beginning of an apparent 600–800-year gap in the archaeological record, suggesting a sudden collapse in island human populations.29 [part0051.html#note1217] * A marine core from the western Pacific, 1,500 kilometers north of Papua New Guinea, provides a biomass-burning record spanning a period of 368,000 years. This core is unusual in providing a record not only of charcoal but also of black carbon, which includes AC/soot. The core exhibits a high black-carbon peak spanning the period between 13,291 and 12,515 years ago and overlapping the Younger Dryas onset at around 12,800 years ago. In addition, the YDB peak in black carbon coincides with an above-average charcoal peak at around 12,750 years ago.30 [part0051.html#note1218] * Evidence from widely separated ice records and sediment records demonstrates that a major, widespread peak in biomass burning occurred on at least four continents at the warm-to-cold transition marking the YD onset. This peak is synchronous with the cosmic-impact layer at the Younger Dryas Boundary as recorded by multiple impact-related proxies, including peak abundances of platinum, high-temperature microspherules, and meltglass.31 [part0051.html#note1219]In summary, the earth and all life upon it endured and was devastated by whatcan only be described as a globally distributed firestorm at the onset of theYounger Dryas around 12,800 years ago. In this planetary debacle, 10 millionsquare kilometers of trees and other plant matter burned.To put that in perspective, the United Kingdom was in a state of traumatic shockin late June and early July 2018 after 4,942 acres of Lancashire moorland wereconsumed by wildfires. That’s an area of just 20 square kilometers, butfirefighters and emergency services from seven counties were utterly overwhelmedby the blaze and the military had to be brought in to assist.32[part0051.html#note1220]Meanwhile, a report in the Sacramento Bee dated July 2, 2018, opined thatCalifornia’s wildfire season had started early, with two “major fires” alreadyfought at huge expense and requiring evacuation of local residents. These twofires were estimated to have consumed 85,000 acres,33 [part0051.html#note1221]which sounds an awful lot but in fact converts to just 344 square kilometers.The previous year, 2017, was California’s most destructive wildfire season thenon record, with a total of 1.25 million acres burned.34 [part0051.html#note1222]The cost of dealing with the disaster, including fire suppression, insurance,and recovery expenditures, was estimated at US$180 billion.35[part0051.html#note1223] Yet 1.38 million acres converts to just 5,585 squarekilometers—an insignificant fraction (around 0.05 percent—that is, a twentiethof 1 percent) of the 10 million square kilometers destroyed in the Younger Dryaswildfires.It seems, therefore, that the United States and Britain, two of the world’swealthiest, most technologically advanced, and most powerful countries, facegreat difficulties in confronting what are, in the grand scheme of things,relatively minor wildfires. Imagine, then, the consequences for all livingthings of the great inferno that consumed 9 percent of the earth’s biomassaround 12,800 years ago and that left an indelible record of its climatic andatmospheric impact in lake sediments and Arctic ice.IMPACT WINTERNEWS FOOTAGE OF THE US AND UK summer wildfires shows smoke everywhere. Close upit seems foggy or misty. In the longer view there’s an obvious gloom, adarkening of the skies, where the pall obscures incoming sunlight. It’s a localeffect, of course. Fifty miles away the air is clear and the skies are blue.The 2018 Journal of Geology study reports that matters would have been verydifferent at the onset of the Younger Dryas, when the smoke from 10 millionsquare kilometers of burning biomass would have enshrouded the entire earth,creating what Wendy Wolbach and her coauthors describe as an “impact winter.”36[part0051.html#note1224]This is a concept derived directly from research in the early 1980s revealingpreviously unexpected consequences of a nuclear war in the form of a “nuclearwinter.” The findings of that research were first put before the public inOctober 1983 in an article by esteemed astrophysicist Carl Sagan under theheadline “In a Nuclear Exchange, More Than a Billion People Would Instantly BeKilled, But the Long-Term Consequences Could Be Much Worse.”Appearing in a mass-circulation magazine, Sagan’s article showed that theimmense quantities of dust and smoke arising from multiple nuclear explosions,and from the wildfires they sparked off, would significantly reduce the amountof sunlight reaching the surface of the earth, causing a steep and sustainedfall in global temperatures, widespread failure of crops, and devastatingfamines. Nor would a full-scale war between superpowers be required to bring onthe terrible, and potentially terminal, consequences of a nuclear winter. Even aregional nuclear conflict could do it.37 [part0051.html#note1225] “We haveplaced our civilization and our species in jeopardy,” Sagan concluded.38[part0051.html#note1226]In the case of the Younger Dryas, the jeopardy that humanity faced was not fromnuclear missiles but from the incoming fragments of a disintegrating giantcomet, traveling at tens of kilometers per second, with the larger fragments asdeadly as hundreds of nuclear warheads. Indeed, it is estimated that the totalexplosive power of the comet fragments that struck the earth in repeatedepisodes over a period of 21 years some 12,800 years ago would have been of theorder of 10 million megatons39 [part0051.html#note1227]—1,000 times greater thanall the nuclear devices stockpiled in the world today.40[part0051.html#note1228]The Younger Dryas is already recognized as an epoch of extreme, anomalous coldthat lasted for approximately 1,200 years, setting in fast and suddenly around12,800 years ago and ending, equally suddenly, around 11,600 years ago. TheJournal of Geology study greatly enriches this picture with compelling newevidence that the onset of this 1,200-year “deep-freeze” was marked by a briefperiod of extremely intense and large-scale wildfires triggered by “the radiantand thermal energy from multiple explosions” as fragments from the comet swarmpelted the earth:This widespread biomass-burning generated large amounts of long-lived,persistent AC/soot that blocked nearly all sunlight, rapidly triggering animpact winter that transitioned into the YD cool episode.41[part0051.html#note1229] …The negative effects of AC/soot might have persisted for 6 wk or more at the YDonset, blocking all sunlight and causing rapid cooling. Reduced insolation isalso expected from the injection of comet dust to the upper atmosphere. If so,the lack of sunlight would have had widespread and catastrophic biotic effects,including insufficient light for plant photosynthesis and growth. At the sametime, North Atlantic deep-water formation ceased, thus throttling the so-calledocean conveyor and triggering a sustained decrease in near-globaltemperatures.42 [part0051.html#note1230]THE MAMMOTH IN THE ROOMIT HAS LONG BEEN UNDERSTOOD that an interruption of the warm Atlantic currentknown as the Gulf Stream correlates with YD cooling, and it is generally agreedthata great gush of cold freshwater derived from the melting Laurentide ice sheet …swept across the surface of the North Atlantic. It prevented warm, salty waterfrom the southern ocean flowing deep below the surface (the Gulf Stream) fromrising to the surface. The normal overturning of the ocean water stopped. As aconsequence the atmosphere over the ocean, which would normally have beenwarmed, remained cold and so, in consequence, did the air over Europe and NorthAmerica.43 [part0051.html#note1231]It’s revealing, looking back through the scientific literature, to see how longexplanations of this sort were simply taken for granted. That there had been acold-water flood was not in doubt, so the detective work that at firstinterested scientists most was WHERE all the water had come from.The reader will recall that the North American ice cap had two distinct segmentsconsisting of two separate ice sheets, the Cordilleran in the west and theLaurentide in the east, which were often joined, but which in the later stagesof the Ice Age were separated by the famous “ice-free corridor” that for a longwhile was erroneously believed to have been the sole route for human migrationinto the Americas. Along the southern margins of these ice sheets, enormousglacial lakes formed and were prone to flooding—most famously glacial lakeMissoula in the west and glacial lake Agassiz in the east. Floodwaters out ofLake Missoula would have had no access to the Atlantic Ocean (they would havebeen routed into the Pacific). Lake Agassiz was therefore thought to be the mostlikely source, and a study published in Geology in January 2018 confirms thatits floodwaters “could have been routed eastward to the North Atlantic at theYounger Dryas onset and caused the canonical abrupt climate shift.”44[part0051.html#note1232]Image Missing [../images/00145.jpeg]After Geology, “Opening of Glacial Lake Agassiz’s Eastern Outlets by the Startof the Younger Dryas Cold Period,” January 4, 2018.So we know that a cold-water flood poured into the Atlantic ocean around 12,800years ago on a scale sufficient to stop the Gulf Stream in its tracks; we knowthat glacial lake Agassiz has been implicated in it; and we know that this“great gush of cold freshwater” has been connected to the plunge in globaltemperature—the “deep freeze”—that defines the Younger Dryas cold event.The issue that most of the scientists are skirting, however—the mammoth in theroom—is why such a flood would have occurred at the onset of the Younger Dryas“deep freeze” around 12,800 years ago rather than, say, 800 or 1,000 yearsearlier at the height of the warm phase—known as the Bølling—Allerødinterstadial—that immediately preceded the Younger Dryas.45[part0051.html#note1233] Intuitively one feels the meltwater floods should havebeen at their peak during the warming phase. Why, therefore, in this case only,do we see them at the onset of an extremely cold phase? I raised this problem inMagicians of the Gods in 2015,46 [part0051.html#note1234] and it is raised againby Wolbach et al. in their 2018 paper, where they present evidence that deepensthe mystery. “Unlike for typical warm-to-cold climate transitions,” they report,“global sea levels rose up to 2–4 m within a few decades or less at the YDonset, as recorded in coral reefs in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.”47[part0051.html#note1235]The point is understated, but this is a very big deal. Two to 4 meters of globalsea-level rise within “a few decades or less” of the onset of the Younger Dryasis an IMMENSE amount of water, a cataclysmic world flood by any standard.What makes it all the more remarkable, however—and all the more puzzling—is theevidence from Wolbach’s study that in the exact same period the planet suffereda spectacular episode of biomass burning and an associated “impact winter” that“caused warm interglacial temperatures to abruptly fall to cold, near-glaciallevels within less than a year, possibly in as little as 3 months.”48[part0051.html#note1236]Meanwhile, in the process of absorbing that sudden massive flood of icy waterinto the North Atlantic, the world ocean had reacted by shutting off the GulfStream, thus sustaining freezing temperatures in Europe and North America andsetting in process the entire Younger Dryas cold episode.Image Missing [../images/00146.jpeg]What we are looking for, therefore, is an agent capable—simultaneously andalmost instantaneously—of bringing about all of the following: * a global flood * wildfires across an area of 10 million km2 * 6 months of icy darkness followed by more than 1,000 years of glacially cold weather * a stratum of soil across more than 50 million km2 dated to the Younger Dryas Boundary (YDB) and infused with a cocktail of nanodiamonds, high-temperature iron-rich spherules, glassy silica-rich spherules, meltglass, platinum, iridium, osmium, and other exotic materials * a mass extinction of megafaunaWolbach and her coauthors are forthright in their conclusion:Multiple lines of ice-core evidence appear synchronous, and this synchroneity ofmultiple events makes the YD interval one of the most unusual climate episodesin the entire Quaternary record. … A cosmic impact is the only known eventcapable of simultaneously producing the collective evidence.49[part0051.html#note1237]A VIOLENT HURRICANE OF BOLIDESWHAT KIND OF COSMIC IMPACT?From quite early in the research, since the first strong impact-proxy evidencewas analyzed, it’s been the consensus view of CRG members that the agentresponsible for the Younger Dryas cataclysm was a comet. Wolbach’s studystrengthens that position, noting:Comets are a compositionally variable mix of volatile ices, meteoritic material,and presolar dust. … Wide ranges of elemental ratios confirm that cometarymaterial is heterogeneous, similar to the YDB samples. Although the type of YDBimpactor remains unclear, the current evidence does not support any specificmeteoritic type as source. Instead, the broad extent of biomass burning at theYD onset is more consistent with Earth’s collision with a fragmented comet50[part0051.html#note1238] … [resulting in a] violent hurricane of bolides51[part0051.html#note1239] … [that] detonated above and/or collided with land, icesheets, and oceans across at least four continents in the Northern and SouthernHemispheres.52 [part0051.html#note1240]This scenario, the study argues, explains all the anomalous and synchronousevidence:Vaporization of cometary materials, and platinum-group-element–rich targetrocks, injected Pt, Ir, Os, and other heavy metals into the stratosphere,accompanied by impact-related nanodiamonds, meltglass, and microspherules.53[part0051.html#note1241]Airburst fireballs and the ejection of molten rocks … triggered many individualwildfires over wide areas, producing one of the largest concentrations ofcombustion aerosols deposited in the Greenland ice sheet during the past120,000–368,000 years. In the higher midlatitudes, atmospheric and oceanictemperatures abruptly decreased from warm interglacial to near-glacialconditions within a few months to a year. Atmospheric and cometary dust, alongwith AC/soot, triggered the rapid onset of an impact winter. This blocking ofsunlight led to a die-off of vegetation. Damage to the ozone layer likely led toan increase in ultraviolet-B radiation reaching Earth’s surface, damaging floraand fauna. Increases in nitrogen compounds, sulfates, dust, soot, and othertoxic chemicals from the impact and widespread wildfires likely led to anincrease in acid rain. Increased production of organic matter and burn productsfrom environmental degradation and biomass burning contributed to algal bloomsand the subsequent formation of widespread black mats.54[part0051.html#note1242]In my view, however, by far the most significant finding of the study, fittingperfectly with the scenario of a disintegrating comet, is:The impact event destabilized the ice-sheet margins, causing extensive icebergcalving into the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans. The airburst/impactscollapsed multiple ice dams of proglacial lakes along the ice-sheet margins,producing extensive meltwater flooding into the Arctic and North AtlanticOceans. Destabilization of the ice sheet also may have triggered extensivesubglacial ice-sheet flooding, leaving widespread, flood-related landformsacross large parts of Canada. The massive outflow of proglacial lake waters,ice-sheet meltwater, and icebergs into the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceanscaused rerouting of oceanic thermohaline circulation. Through climaticfeedbacks, this, in turn, led to the YD cool episode.55 [part0051.html#note1243]In other words, the long-established and widely accepted evidence linking theonset of the Younger Dryas cold interval to a freshwater flood off the NorthAmerican ice cap and consequent changes in oceanic circulation is fully acceptedby Wolbach. What she and her coauthors add, however, is:an additional key element … suggesting that these climate-changing mechanismsdid not occur randomly but rather were triggered by the YDB impact event. Aftershutdown of the ocean conveyor, the YD episode persisted … not because ofcontinued airburst/impacts but because, once circulation stopped, feedback loopsand inertia within the ocean system maintained the changed state of circulationuntil it reverted to its previous state.56 [part0051.html#note1244]Indeed so. No one is suggesting that impacts and airbursts continued throughoutthe entire 1,200 years of the Younger Dryas cold interval. Wolbach and hercolleagues leave us in no doubt that their study is focused on the beginning ofthat interval and specifically on the sudden and mysterious climatic reversalfrom warm to cold around 12,800 years ago that they attribute to an “impactevent.” They remind us at several points in their Journal of Geology paper,however, that when they speak of an “event” they do not mean to imply a one-off“hurricane of bolides” striking the earth over a single day or two in a singleyear. What the evidence points to, instead, is a series of such brief but deadlyencounters recurring biannually over the full period of 21 years of platinumenrichment identified in the Greenland ice cores.57 [part0051.html#note1245]Many of the individual impactors would have been Tunguska-meteor-size orsmaller, but they would have come in vast swarms capable of doing enormousdamage, and there is evidence that at least once during these 21 years thebiannual “hurricane of bolides” may have contained comet fragments withdiameters of a kilometer or more.This is what was specifically proposed in the very first scientific paper tooutline the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis. Coauthored by Wendy Wolbach,Richard Firestone, Allen West, and more than twenty others, and published inProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in October 2007, it raised thepossibility that “multiple 2km objects struck the 2km thick Laurentide IceSheet.”58 [part0051.html#note1246]Subsequently, in September 2013, Yingzhe Wu, Mukul Sharma et al. drew attentionto the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada, where a submerged impact crater with adiameter of 4 kilometers—the Corossol Crater—has been dated to the Younger DryasBoundary. Looking at a range of other evidence they concluded there had beenmultiple impacts in this region “that were closely associated in time.”59[part0051.html#note1247]Separately, Richard Firestone and Allen West reported evidence of an airburst atthe Younger Dryas Boundary “near the Great Lakes of an object unusually enrichedin titanium and other incompatible elements. Terrestrial-like ejecta fell closeto an impact site near Gainey while projectile-rich ejecta fell farther away.High water content in the ejecta favors an airburst over the Laurentide IceSheet north of Gainey.”60 [part0051.html#note1248]Now perhaps we are getting closer to an explanation of how a single cause couldaccount both for plunging the earth into a 1,000-year “deep freeze” and formelting sufficient quantities of glacial ice to raise global sea level by up to4 meters. The immense meltwater pulse that entered the North Atlantic and ArcticOceans was of course not the result of anomalous global warming in an epoch ofglobal cooling but a direct consequence of the “destabilization” of the icesheet by impacts and airbursts of multiple comet fragments—indeed of a swarm ofcomets. The thermal energy and blast wave radiated out southward beyond the icemargin all across North America, accompanied by additional local airbursts andimpacts that set immense areas of the continent’s primeval conifer forestsablaze,61 [part0051.html#note1249] followed by “aerial detonations or groundimpacts by numerous relatively small cometary fragments, widely dispersed acrossseveral continents.”62 [part0051.html#note1250]Wolbach et al. looked into a series of seven episodes of meltwater release thatoccurred during the Ice Age, of which the Younger Dryas was the last. Named“Heinrich Events” (after Hartmut Heinrich, the marine geologist who firstidentified them), such episodes are distinguished by massive armadas of icebergscalving off the continental glaciers. These icebergs carry rocks, rubble, andother debris that as the bergs melt are deposited on the ocean floor wheregeologists can identify them, measure them, and derive estimates of scale andchronology.It’s therefore notable that,even though the YD is considered a Heinrich event (designated H0), theanomalously high peak in wildfire activity at the YD onset is completelyopposite to that of six previous Heinrich events, which showed low levels ofbiomass burning. … This is a crucial observation: the presence of high peaks inbiomass burning at the YD onset is completely contrary to very low levels ofbiomass burning observed at previous similar climatic transitions, making the YDclimate episode highly anomalous and unexplainable by the natural processes thatcreated previous warm-to-cold transitions.63 [part0051.html#note1251]Again, the hypothesis of repeated encounters with the fragments of adisintegrating comet over the 21 years from 12,836 to 12,815 years ago providesa straightforward explanation for this apparently anomalous state of affairs.The Younger Dryas Heinrich Event was not triggered by normal climatic changesbut by the impacts of comet fragments on the North American ice cap.We cannot say exactly when within that 21-year period the impact-relateddestabilization of the ice cap occurred. It might have been right at thebeginning, or right at the end, or somewhere in the middle, and it might havehappened more than once. What the data from the Greenland ice cores definitelydo indicate, however, as we saw in the previous chapter, is that the ferocityand intensity of the bombardment, with its accompanying rain of platinum,increased year-on-year for the first 14 years, reached a peak around 12,822years ago, and then declined over the next 7 years until ceasing as abruptly asit had begun.It’s a good guess, therefore—nothing more scientific than that—that the peak ofthe comet’s interaction with the North American ice cap, and most likely thetime when the really big fragments came in, would be around 12,822 years ago.Allen West and fellow CRG scientist Richard Firestone think as many as eightsuch kilometer-scale fragments64 [part0051.html#note1252] may have struck theice cap, excavating their craters in the 2-kilometer-deep ice that subsequentlymelted away, leaving little or no permanent trace on the ground beneath, orleaving craters that are hard to find, for example, four suspiciously deep holesin lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, and Ontario.65 [part0051.html#note1253]Encounters with any fragments of this size, let alone multiple fragments, wouldalready constitute a planetary disaster on an almost unimaginable scale,wherever they occurred. What we must keep in mind, however, although NorthAmerica was the epicenter, is that the terrible impacts experienced there wereonly part of a much wider event that left a trail of devastation across at leastthree other continents.WHAT WAS LOSTEXTINCTIONS OF ANIMAL SPECIES TOOK place all around the world at the onset ofthe Younger Dryas but were particularly fast, savage, and severe in NorthAmerica, where thirty-five genera of large mammals were wiped out.66[part0051.html#note1254]Offering evidence from seventy-three sites across twenty-three US states,Wolbach et al. document the synchroneity of these megafaunal extinctions withthe Younger Dryas impact.67 [part0051.html#note1255] Three examples—one ofwhich, Murray Springs, was the subject of the last chapter—can stand for therest: * BLACKWATER DRAW, NEW MEXICO: At this site, a distinctive black-mat layer, dating to the onset of YD climate change, is in direct contact with peaks in magnetic spherules, Pt, Ir, and biomass-burning proxies, including charcoal, glass-like carbon, fullerenes, and PAHs [polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]. These proxies are draped conformably over the last known bones of mammoths killed by Clovis hunters, who then abandoned the site for hundreds of years. The evidence from Blackwater Draw suggests that the YDB impact event is coeval with the megafaunal extinctions and a human population decline, along with a peak in biomass burning and with YD climate change. * MURRAY SPRINGS, ARIZONA: Peaks in magnetic spherules, meltglass, nanodiamonds, Pt, and Ir [are located] immediately beneath a distinctive black mat that dates to the YD onset. Peaks in YDB biomass-burning proxies include charcoal, carbon spherules, glass-like carbon, AC/soot, fullerenes, and PAHs. At this site, several mammoths were killed by Clovis hunters, after which the black mat formed atop the bones and humans abandoned the site for ~1000 y. Thus, the evidence supports the synchroneity of the YDB impact event, increased biomass burning, YD climate change, megafaunal extinctions, and a major human population decline. * SHERIDEN CAVE, OHIO: There are YDB peaks in magnetic spherules, meltglass, nanodiamonds, Pt, and Ir. A charcoal-rich black mat dates to the YD onset and contains peak abundances of charcoal, AC/soot, carbon spherules, and nanodiamonds that are closely associated with the last known Clovis artifacts in the cave. The black-mat layer is in direct contact with the wildfire-charred bones of two mega-mammals, the flat-headed peccary (Platygonus compressus) and the giant beaver (Castoroidies ohioensis), that are the last known examples anywhere in the world of those extinct species.68 [part0051.html#note1256]Horses, camels, mammoths, mastodons, giant ground sloths, saber-tooth tigers,short-faced bears, and dire wolves are among the other iconic creatures of theIce Age that disappear from the record at this time. “This represents a majorextinction,” James Kennett and Allen West remind us in a paper published in 2018by the Florida Museum of Natural History:Not only because so many large and well-known animals were lost, but alsobecause many of the extinct taxa had resided for millions of years in NorthAmerica. Horse evolution had continued without a break in North America sincethe Eocene (~55 million years ago) with the only known absence beginning ataround ~12,800 years ago until their return from Europe ~500 years ago. Clearlysuch extinctions are highly anomalous.69 [part0051.html#note1257]All in all, Kennett and West conclude:Sufficient geologic and chronologic data now exists to support the hypothesisthat megafaunal extinctions were caused by continental-scale ecosystemdisruption, resulting from the cosmic impact at the onset of the YD. … Themegafaunal extinction would not have occurred at or close to the YD onsetwithout the YDB cosmic impact at ~12,800 years ago. Instead many of the nowextinct animals would have survived much longer, even to modern times.70[part0051.html#note1258]The archaeological evidence is scarce, perhaps precisely because so much wasswept away and covered over by the Younger Dryas earth changes. Nonetheless,it’s clear that along with the disruption of animal life in North America, thecataclysm also had severe consequences for human beings.Top of the list, of course, is the abrupt, mysterious disappearance of theentire successful, technically accomplished, and geographically widespreadClovis culture right around 12,800 years ago.71 [part0051.html#note1259] Then,in the centuries following, if we take the case of the southeast as an example,we see a sudden anomalous 50 percent drop in the numbers of projectile pointsbeing made.72 [part0051.html#note1260] A similar trend is seen in many otherparts of North America at the same time,73 [part0051.html#note1261] and inCalifornia there is evidence of a cessation of human activity between roughly12,800 years ago and 12,200 years ago.74 [part0051.html#note1262]A study of almost 700 cultural carbon-14 dates from across North America byDavid Anderson, Albert Goodyear, and others shows “a rapid decline” in humanactivities “at the beginning of the YD that reached its lowest level early inthe YD … a 200-year-long 80 percent decline in the number of cultural carbon-14dates, implying a major decrease in population … followed by a gradual reboundfor ~900 years.”75 [part0051.html#note1263]We do not possess a time machine. We cannot place ourselves physically in NorthAmerica 12,800 years ago. But all the evidence suggests the continent passedthrough a tremendous, earthshaking cataclysm, and we know that at least oneancestral North American culture—Clovis—became every bit as extinct 12,800 yearsago as the mammoths and the dire wolves.What else went the way of Clovis in that time of burning darkness and icyfloods?"},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00147.jpeg]CAPE FEARIMAGINE A WORLD WHERE GOOD, honest, hardworking, inquisitive scientists live infear of ruining their careers, perhaps even of losing their jobs and incomes, ifthey investigate certain subjects that have been judged by a dominant elite tobe “taboo.”Is such a climate of fear-based conformity likely to result in good science thatbreaks new ground? Or is it likely to keep science stuck in a rut, endlesslyrefining and reconfirming established models while rejecting any evidence thatsuggests those models might be wrong or in need of fundamental revision?These are not rhetorical questions, because it turns out that this “imaginary”world is the very world we live in today. Science in the twenty-first centurydoes NOT encourage scientists to take risks in their pursuit of “thefacts”—particularly when those facts call into question long-established notionsabout the human past.The controversy surrounding the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis is an example.Since it was first proposed formally in 2007 the scientists behind it haveendured an unrelenting barrage of deeply unpleasant and self-serving attacksfrom a small but influential group of other scientists whose work and opinionsare challenged by the notion of a comet-induced global cataclysm 12,800 yearsago.In my 2015 book, Magicians of the Gods, I give a detailed account of the majorstudies supporting the YDIH coupled with an equally detailed evaluation of theattacks made on the hypothesis up to that point.1 [part0051.html#note1264] Iwill not repeat the same information here since it is on record and can easilybe consulted. My conclusion at the time was that the attacks were generallyunjustified, misleading, and propagandistic, and that the YDIH constitutes thebest possible explanation for the earthshaking events of 12,800 years ago. Now,as I write these words in 2018, my desk is covered with papers published duringthe past 3 years presenting a great mass of new evidence that very stronglyreinforces, extends, and develops the original Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis.The biomass-burning and platinum studies mentioned in chapter 26 are the jewelsin the crown, which is why I focused on them in the limited space availablehere. The other studies are referenced in the notes.2 [part0051.html#note1265]I’m more confident than ever that the Comet Research Group scientists are on theright track, and I hold them in the highest regard for speaking truth to powerand being willing to stick their necks out. I was therefore excited when GeorgeHoward, not a scientist but an environmental restoration specialist and asupporter of CRG who edits the online magazine Cosmic Tusk, contacted me tosuggest a meet-up with some of the leading members of the group during my fall2017 research trip across the United States. On the same trip I met Al Goodyearand Allen West, and now here was an opportunity to exchange views with some oftheir other colleagues.The meet-up was scheduled for Wilmington, North Carolina, on November 13 and 14,2017. Chris Moore and Malcolm LeCompte, coauthors of both the platinum and thebiomass-burning papers, would join us from the University of South Carolina,together with their colleague Mark Demitroff of Stockton University in NewJersey, coauthor of several earlier papers providing solid support for theYDIH.3 [part0051.html#note1266]I invited my friend and colleague Randall Carlson to drive in from Atlanta to bepart of the discussions. His work connecting impacts on the North American icecap 12,800 years ago to the immense flood damage in the Channeled Scablands ofeastern Washington State is discussed extensively in Magicians of the Gods.4[part0051.html#note1267]Image Missing [../images/00148.jpeg]PHOTO: FAIRCHILD AERIAL SURVEYS, 1930.And I was pleased to learn that George Howard had also asked Antonio Zamora tobe there. An independent researcher, a chemist, and a computer scientist,5[part0051.html#note1268] Zamora is not a member of CRG and has nothingwhatsoever to do with the group, but I had recently read an intriguing paper hehad published earlier in 2017 in the peer-reviewed journal Geomorphology tracingthe origins of the Carolina Bays to the Younger Dryas impacts.6[part0051.html#note1269]Around 500,000 peculiar elliptical ponds, depressions, and lakes with raisedrims pock much of the US Atlantic seaboard from Delaware to Florida. Since itwas in the Carolinas that scientists first noticed them in the late nineteenthcentury, they became known as Carolina Bays and from quite early on there weretheories that they had been created by an immense swarm of meteorites strikingthe earth.7 [part0051.html#note1270] Several CRG members have explored thepossibility that the Younger Dryas impacts might be connected to the mystery,8[part0051.html#note1271] but the majority of the group have since distancedthemselves from such notions. Dating studies indicate that the Bays were not allcreated simultaneously, as the YDIH would require, but are of widely varyingages separated by tens of thousands of years.9 [part0051.html#note1272]Antonio Zamora’s 2017 paper in Geomorphology put the cat among the pigeons byraising an interesting scenario whereby the bays could, after all, have resultedfrom YD impacts. I had naively assumed that Malcolm LeCompte and Mark Demitroff(who were then both CRG members but have since resigned) would welcome this newresearch.I couldn’t have been more wrong.GLACIER ICE IMPACT HYPOTHESISLET’S START BY TAKING A proper look at the controversial proposals behind the“Glacier Ice Impact Hypothesis” that Antonio Zamora puts on the table in hisGeomorphology paper.10 [part0051.html#note1273]He begins by recognizing earlier evidence that discounts the Carolina Bays asimpact features but then draws our attention to an intriguing mystery—theso-called Nebraska Rainwater Basins. Other than being oriented from northeast tosouthwest instead of from northwest to southeast (an important piece of evidencein itself), these curious elliptical geological formations more than 2,000kilometers west of the Carolinas greatly resemble the bays:The Nebraska Rainwater Basins are not as well known as the Carolina Bays buttheir elliptical shape is so similar that it is necessary to consider that theyformed contemporaneously with the Carolina Bays by the same mechanisms. … Theobjective of the Glacier Ice Impact Hypothesis is to examine the characteristicsof the Carolina Bays and Nebraska Rainwater Basins to determine whether thesegeomorphological features could have been created by secondary impacts fromterrestrial material, such as glacier ice, ejected by an extraterrestrialimpact.11 [part0051.html#note1274]Zamora is the first to acknowledge that his “Glacier Ice Impact Hypothesis”depends heavily on prior work done by two other investigators, Michael E.Davias12 [part0051.html#note1275] and Thomas H. S. Harris,13[part0051.html#note1276] the former a specialist in “geospatial big data, datamining, computer graphics and algorithms” and the latter a dynamics and flightscience expert at Lockheed Martin Corporation.Image Missing [../images/00149.jpeg]LEFT: Nebraska Rainwater Basins.

RIGHT: Instead of erosion by glacial ice, Davias andHarris propose that Saginaw Bay is the footprint of a massive impact of a cosmicobject that struck ancient Michigan at an oblique angle. IMAGE: MICHAEL DAVIAS,CINTOS.ORG [http://CINTOS.ORG].When Davias and Harris gave their paper at the Geological Society of America in2015 they tentatively suggested an age of 786,000 years for the formation ofSaginaw Bay.20 [part0051.html#note1283] While drawing on their excellentballistics and triangulation work, Zamora’s presentation of his own Glacial IceImpact Hypothesis in his 2017 paper in Geomorphology rejects so great an age andoffers a compelling case that Saginaw Bay was scooped out just 12,800 years agoby one of the fragments of the Younger Dryas comet.21 [part0051.html#note1284]On technical grounds to do with “the thermodynamics of water in a liquid state”he also rejects Davias and Harris’s notion that the ejecta would have consistedof a “foam of sand and water.”22 [part0051.html#note1285] According to Zamora’scalculations, massive quantities of solid glacial ice would instead have beenblasted aloft:Experiments of high-speed impacts on ice sheets using NASA’s Ames Vertical Gundemonstrate that ice shatters when a projectile hits it. Pieces of ice areejected, radiating from the impact site in ballistic trajectories.23[part0051.html#note1286]“The Laurentide Ice Sheet,” writes Zamora,covered the convergence point determined by Davias and Harris in Saginaw Baywith a thickness of approximately 1500 to 2000 m of ice during the Pleistocene.… Ballistic equations, scaling laws relating crater size to impact energy,geometrical analysis and statistical analysis provide a mathematical foundationfor explaining the shape of the bays and their origin from secondary impacts ofglacier ice ejected from the Laurentide Ice Sheet that covered Michigan.24[part0051.html#note1287]It’s important to be clear on this.Just as Zamora does not support Davias and Harris’s idea that the ejectaconsisted of pulverized sandstone and water, so, too, he adamantly does NOTsuggest that hundreds of thousands of fragments of the original Younger Dryascomet bombarded North America’s Atlantic seaboard, creating the phenomenon ofthe Carolina Bays. Neither is he suggesting that the Nebraska Rainwater Basinswere the result of direct hits by comet fragments. Instead he accepts the CRG’slong-established position that the epicenter of the impacts was the NorthAmerican ice cap.Image Missing [../images/00153.jpeg]Ballistic trajectories of glacier ice ejecta after a cosmic impact on the NorthAmerican ice cap. IMAGE: ANTONIO ZAMORA.In his view all the damage in the Carolinas and Nebraska was done by thestupendous mass of icy ejecta, varying in size from basketballs to “iceboulders” tens or even hundreds of meters across, that fell back to earthfollowing the Saginaw Bay impact.AN APOCALYPTIC VISIONI REFER THE READER TO Zamora’s paper itself for the detailed evidence behind hisfindings. In summary, however, having first reviewed and rejected all otherexplanations for the formation of the bays and basins, and having given specialconsideration to the longer-term evolution of impact craters on viscoussurfaces, Zamora concludes as follows:The radial orientation of the Carolina Bays and Nebraska Rainwater Basins towarda convergence point in Michigan, and the elliptical shapes of the bays withspecific width-to-length ratios can be better explained by impact mechanismsthan by terrestrial wind and water processes.The Glacier Ice Impact Hypothesis … has been supplemented with an experimentalmodel demonstrating that oblique impacts on viscous surfaces can reproduciblycreate inclined conical cavities that are remodeled into shallow ellipticaldepressions by viscous relaxation. This makes it possible to model the CarolinaBays and Nebraska Rainwater Basins as conic sections whose width-to-length ratiocan be explained by the angle of impact.25 [part0051.html#note1288]Zamora addresses the issue of the great diversity of dates for the Carolina Baysobtained by Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL), noting that this hashitherto been the most significant barrier to acceptance of any form of impacthypothesis with reference to the bays. As he rightly points out, however, thefundamental assumption behind the use of OSL has been that the subsurface of theCarolina Bays was exposed to light at the time of bay formation. Hisexperimental model refutes this by demonstrating that impacts on viscoussurfaces are plastic deformations that do not expose the subsurface to light:Image Missing [../images/00154.jpeg]The width-to-length ratios of the Carolina Bays (right) average 0.58 and arevery consistent for bays of different sizes. The bays in Nebraska (left) areindistinguishable from the bays on the East Coast based on their width-to-lengthratios. IMAGE: ANTONIO ZAMORA; LIDAR FROM CINTOS.ORG [http://CINTOS.ORG].Therefore, OSL can only determine the date of the terrain, but not the date offormation of the bays. If all the Carolina Bays and Nebraska Rainwater Basinsformed contemporaneously, it will be necessary to find a different way of datingthem.The Glacier Ice Impact Hypothesis explains all the features of the Carolina Baysand Nebraska Rainwater Basins, including their elliptical shape, radialorientation, raised rims, undisturbed stratigraphy, absence of shockmetamorphism, overlapping bays, and the occurrence of bays only inunconsolidated ground.26 [part0051.html#note1289]Finally, and chillingly, Zamora’s paper in Geomorphology notes:The great surface density of the bays indicates that they were created by acatastrophic saturation bombing with impacts of 13 KT to 3 MT that would havecaused a mass extinction in an area with a radius of 1500 km from theextraterrestrial impact in Michigan. This paper has considered mainly the iceboulders ejected by an extraterrestrial impact on the Laurentide Ice Sheetduring the Pleistocene, but the impact would also have ejected water andproduced steam. Taking into consideration the thermodynamic properties of water,any liquid water ejected above the atmosphere would have transformed into a fogof ice crystals that would have blocked the light of the sun. Thus, the time offormation of the Carolina Bays and Nebraska Rainwater Basins must coincide withan extinction event in the eastern half of the United States and the onset of aperiod of global cooling. This combination of conditions is best met by thedisappearance of the North American megafauna, the end of the Clovis culture andthe onset of the Younger Dryas cooling event at 12,800 cal. BP. The report of aplatinum anomaly typical of extraterrestrial impacts at the Younger DryasBoundary supports this scenario.27 [part0051.html#note1290]Image Missing [../images/00155.jpeg]IMAGE: ANTONIO ZAMORA.In his book Killer Comet, Zamora elaborates on the extent and true horror of theYounger Dryas cataclysm. He considers how the effects of the primary impact overMichigan would have been massively compounded across North America by thesecondary impacts of glacier ice boulders. It’s instructive to spend a fewmoments with the disturbing picture he paints:All living things within 100 kilometers of the [Michigan] impact died instantly.They were either burned by the heat blast or killed by the shock wave. On theEast Coast, 1000 kilometers from the impact zone, the blinding flash on thehorizon was followed by a sky that darkened ominously as it filled with thegiant ice boulders ejected by the impact. Three minutes after the flash, thedark sky advanced relentlessly, and the ground shook as the first seismic wavesfrom the extraterrestrial impact site arrived traveling at 5 km/sec.By this time, all animals and humans were aware that something terrible washappening. The sky continued to darken, and then filled with bright streaks asthe ice boulders in suborbital flights re-entered the atmosphere at speeds of 3to 4 km/sec. … [As] the giant ice boulders started falling … the thumping of theimpacts sent shock waves through the ground that traveled at 5 to 8 km/sec. …The shaking ground started to liquefy, trapping everyone. The ground had turnedto quicksand, making it impossible to walk or run …At the peak of intensity, a hail of glacier ice chunks, many as big as abaseball stadium, left steam trails in the sky as they re-entered the atmosphereat supersonic speeds and crashed into the liquefied ground accompanied by thethunder of sonic booms.The impacts created oblique, muddy, conical craters … with diameters of one totwo kilometres … that swallowed whole villages and buried all the vegetation.The vibration of the ground quickly reduced the depth of the conical craters andturned them into [the] shallow depressions [that we know today as the CarolinaBays]. … The comet itself had not killed the megafauna. The saturationbombardment by the ice boulders that were ejected when the comet struck theLaurentide ice sheet caused the extinction event. … The landscape of the EasternSeaboard had been transformed into a barren wasteland full of huge, shallow mudholes. …The Carolina Bays have remained as evidence of the glacier ice impacts on thesoft, sandy soil of the East Coast.No such evidence remains of the ice chunks that must have fallen on harderground, but the ice impacts in the central and Midwestern states were equallymerciless. When the colossal chunks of glacier ice hit the hard terrain, theyshattered and sent out ice fragments at high speed. Any creature or vegetationin the path of the fast-moving ice shards was destroyed.When the ice finally came to rest, the ejecta blanket had covered one-half ofthe contiguous United States with a thick layer of crushed ice … that increasedthe albedo of the Earth and reflected a significant portion of the dimmer lightfrom the Sun back into space. The combined effect of the increased ice cover andthe orbiting ice crystals would make the land cold and inhospitable for manyyears. …The buried vegetation would freeze or remain dormant under the ice. Grazinganimals that had survived the glacier ice bombardment had no access to theirnormal food sources and would soon starve. Predators that were still alive wouldalso soon die without their herbivorous prey. …Eventually, North America would be repopulated by new land animals and newhumans, but the megafauna, and the ingenious Clovis people that had crafted suchfine stone projectiles were gone forever.28 [part0051.html#note1291]It’s an apocalyptic vision to be sure, and we must remind ourselves that itdeals with the widespread consequences of just one of the major impacts on theNorth American ice cap.ATTACK AND DESTROYAS WE’VE SEEN, ALLEN WEST and Richard Firestone propose that there may have beenas many as eight significant impacts on the North American ice cap during the 21years of the peak Younger Dryas bombardments.29 [part0051.html#note1292]Together with the other scientists from the Comet Research Group, they havefocused, with great success, on gathering the evidence for these bombardments inthe form of impact proxies scattered across 50 million square kilometers of theearth’s surface.What none of the group has yet done, however, is investigate the fullimplications for North America itself of the hypothesized impacts on the icecap.Why Antonio Zamora matters, and why his work deserves serious evaluation, isthat he is the first to undertake such an exercise—albeit focused on only oneout of the possible eight impacts. In addition, he offers testable hypothesesand opens up new vistas for inquiry and discussion. I was therefore expecting tospend 2 constructive and thought-provoking days at Wilmington, sharing ideaswith big thinkers and giving proper consideration for the first time to theimplications of the icy fallout across North America that Zamora rightlycalculates would have been the outcome of impacts on the ice cap.The opposite happened. It was clear from the outset that the only reason MalcolmLeCompte and Mark Demitroff were with us at Wilmington at all was to attack anddestroy the Glacier Ice Impact Hypothesis at birth. There was no interestwhatsoever in a discussion of the wider implications of Zamora’s thinking. Theirentire focus was to demonstrate that he was completely wrong to link theCarolina Bays to any kind of cosmic impacts, and to the Younger Dryas impacts inparticular.At one level this was all good. For science to progress it is important that allideas be tested in the fire of peer review. And while Zamora’s hypothesis hadalready been through that fire once in order to have appeared in Geomorphologyat all, here were other scientists who disagreed.Excellent! Bring it on, guys!I was at Wilmington to learn, and such constructive disagreements would surelyonly help me gain a better understanding of what no scientist today can yetclaim to understand fully—namely, the cause and true extent of the cataclysmicevents that shook the earth at the onset of the Younger Dryas 12,800 years ago.Because I’d gone into the meeting with the mind-set that we were all colleagueshere trying to figure out a solution to one of the greatest mysteries of thepast, I didn’t initially expect the level of antagonism, hostility, scorn, anddownright unpleasantness with which Zamora’s impact hypothesis was received byLeCompte and Demitroff—who are themselves proponents of an impact hypothesis atthe receiving end of a great deal of antagonism, hostility, scorn, andunpleasantness.But that was naivete on my part. Over the following months I was to get a muchclearer understanding of what was really going on.“EXTREMELY REGRETTABLE …”AFTER THE WILMINGTON MEETING, SANTHA and I flew to Little Rock, Arkansas, whereI had a presentation to give at a conference before we returned to the UnitedKingdom. During my talk, which was filmed, I showed a photograph of myself withChris Moore on a field trip to a Carolina Bay—Johns Bay—where platinum had beenfound. I outlined the platinum research and other YDIH research in mypresentation and then moved on to a discussion of Antonio Zamora’s Glacier IceHypothesis. I did not connect his work to the work of the Comet Research Groupand I did not suggest he was a member of the Comet Research Group or hadanything to do with it.The video was released on YouTube on January 26, 2018.30[part0051.html#note1293] A little over a month later I found myself embroiled inheated email correspondence with Malcolm LeCompte and Mark Demitroff.The first salvo was fired on March 9, 2018, with an email from LeCompte toZamora, cc’d to me, titled “Paper by Antonio Zamora: Geomorphology 282 (2017)209–216.”That email accused me of providing “extraordinary coverage” of Zamora’s“speculative theory” in my Little Rock presentation and of giving it exposure“in juxtaposition” with my “discussion of the YDB Impact Hypothesis.” Describingmy alleged “association” of Zamora’s work with the work of the Comet ResearchGroup as “extremely regrettable,” LeCompte added a postscript specificallyaddressed to me:Graham, I find Antonio’s work to be unsupportable, not because impact proxiesaren’t found in the bay rims, as you apparently have been told and are nowsaying, but for the variety of reasons listed in the attached letter, first andforemost of which: because there was no ice in Saginaw Bay or anywhere within200 km of where Antonio believes his impact occurred.My bad about the impact proxies!I had indeed incorrectly stated in that hastily-put-together segment of mypresentation that none were found in the Carolina Bay rims and that this waspart of the long-established dismissal of any impact connection to the bays. Igot that wrong. Platinum is an impact proxy, as I knew very well, and ChrisMoore had found it in the Carolina Bays. Multiple other proxies, including“magnetic grains and microspherules, carbon spherules and glass-like carbon,”have also been found, as a 2010 study reports, “throughout the rims of 16Carolina Bays.”31 [part0051.html#note1294]What I don’t see, however, is how this helps LeCompte’s claim that impacts didnot make the bays. On the contrary, it seems to me that the presence of theproxies there only strengthens the case that the bays are impact-related. Ishall certainly speak of this in future presentations.Much more significant is the second statement in the postscript, to the effectthat 12,800 years ago there was no ice in Saginaw Bay or anywhere within 200kilometers of the proposed impact site. LeCompte elaborates on this point in thelonger letter attached to his mail, formally addressed to the Editor ofGeomorphology, where he refers to “a large body of literature” providingevidence that Zamora’s proposed point of impact had been deglaciated for morethan 1,000 years before the onset of the Younger Dryas and that not only SaginawBay but all of Lake Huron had been ice-free when the Younger Dryas began.This seemed to be a fatal criticism of the Glacier Ice Impact Theory—but Zamoragave an immediate response to LeCompte:In your note to the editor of Geomorphology you say “Dyke (2004), and Larson andSchaetzl (2001), provide graphical depictions of the retreat of the LaurentideIce Sheet with sufficiently high spatial and temporal resolution to make clearthat not only Saginaw Bay, but all of Lake Huron was ice-free at the time of theYounger Dryas onset.”Let us say that no evidence can be found for glaciers at the point where theaxial projections of the bays converge. Geologists usually determine the extentof glacier coverage by examining glacial striations on the terrain and byidentifying deposits of erratic boulders. Would you expect the site of anextraterrestrial impact to retain these markers? Wouldn’t the impact of a 3 kmasteroid obliterate striations and erratic boulders? The subsequent melting ofthe glaciers would then flood the impact point and wash away the last traces ofthe crater. The Carolina Bays do exist, and because they are conic sections, itis very likely that they originated as conical impact cavities. … The NebraskaRainwater Basins are now intimately related to the Carolina Bays through theirgeometry. Any modern publication about the Carolina Bays that ignores theNebraska basins is incomplete and inadequate. … In my paper, I mentioned that anET impact on hard ground would have sent rocky ejecta only one third as far asan impact on ice. Moreover, an impact on land, rather than on ice, would haveleft a typical ET crater. My bet is that there was an ice sheet wherever themeteorite hit, otherwise someone would already have found the crater.Frankly, I thought that Zamora had returned Malcolm’s hardball quite well, andsoon afterward he followed through by sending me a paper I hadn’t come acrossbefore, published in Quaternary Science Reviews in 1986, titled “Correlation ofGlacial Deposits of the Huron, Lake Michigan and Green Bay Lobes in Michigan andWisconsin.”32 [part0051.html#note1295] The paper, by Donald Eschman and DavidMickelson, concludes that following an earlier retreat there was a re-advance ofthe ice sheet during the so-called Port Huron stade around 13,000 years ago andthat at this time both Saginaw Bay and Lake Huron were indeed covered withice.33 [part0051.html#note1296]Once again, therefore, as so often in science, statements touted as facts turnout to be opinions contradicted by other opinions that are also touted as facts.The truth of the matter is that there remains great uncertainty and confusionaround exactly what happened in North America—and across the whole world—at theonset of the Younger Dryas. While that uncertainty persists, alleged“certainties” of almost any kind are inappropriate and it is wise to keep anopen mind to all possibilities.Beyond the issue of the absence (or presence?) of an ice sheet at the proposedpoint of impact, LeCompte’s dismissal of the Glacier Ice Impact Theory is ofcourse supported by other evidence and reasoning, but my purpose here is not toget into these minutiae. I concede the possibility that LeCompte may be rightwhile remaining open to the possibility that he may be wrong. Either way, thereal importance of Zamora’s contribution has been to raise new questions aroundthe matter of the Younger Dryas impacts. Only time and further research willtell whether his theory really solves the mystery of the Carolina Bays and theNebraska Rainwater Basins, but he has undoubtedly done scholarship a service byexploring the ballistics and dynamics of explosive cosmic impacts on the NorthAmerican ice cap, and by looking into the potentially disastrous consequences interms of the subsequent storm of icy ejecta.“YOU WERE REPEATEDLY WARNED …”THE STORM OF EJECTA FROM the Wilmington meeting was far from over. My exchangeof emails with Malcolm LeCompte continued, Mark Demitroff joined theconversation as well, and both of them were clearly very annoyed with me! ChrisMoore was cc’d but did not comment. What became clear from all this was thatLeCompte’s objection to the video was not that I had misrepresented the CometResearch Group in any way, or that I had misrepresented Chris Moore’s recentresearch, but simply that right after what I had to say about the Comet ResearchGroup, ending up with the visit I’d just made with Chris Moore to Johns Bay, Ihad gone on to talk about Zamora’s Glacier Ice Impact Theory.On March 21, 2018, therefore, because I sensed there was something going on herethat was worthy of reporting, and wanted no one involved to be in any doubt thatI intended to report it, I began a new thread of emails under the subject lineFOR THE RECORD:I speak about the work of many scientists [in the video]. The fact that what Ihave to say about the work of one scientist follows what I have to say about thework of another scientist does not mean I am connecting the two—unless Ispecifically do so, which I don’t do here. I am therefore really perplexed as towhy this video has caused offence.I have no hesitation in sharing the bulk of LeCompte’s reply because of thelight it sheds on a growing problem within science in general—the problem ofenforced conformity.The passages that I have placed in bold type were not in bold in the originalbut I choose to emphasize them in the extracts below because of the insightsthey provide into the ways this problem can manifest and the states of mind itengenders.MALCOLM LECOMPTE TO GRAHAM HANCOCK, MARCH 23, 2018:You were … repeatedly warned that any association of Carolina Bay genesis linkedto a discussion of the YDB impact event would likely be harmful to the progressof the YDIH research and to the reputations of its investigators.You may not be aware of the time and energy spent to largely neutralize thedistracting effects and hostility created by the early Carolina Bay relatedassertions made in the non-peer reviewed book: Cycle of Cosmic Catastrophes.[This is a book coauthored by Richard Firestone and Allen West, the originalformulators of the YDIH, and published in 2006, a year before the first formalpaper appeared in PNAS.] The association of bay impact genesis with the YDIHcreated an early perception in some scientific communities that the YDB impactresearch was both unprofessional and bordering on pseudoscientific. Thoseoriginal, naive Bay genesis claims still haunt the research and contribute tohobbling its acceptance as a legitimate research activity for a new generationof scientists. We have few, relatively younger and seasoned tigers like ChrisMoore willing to disregard the real and perceived risks to their careers andreputations, and even fewer younger, newly-trained scientists following in hisfootsteps to adopt what is still considered a somewhat controversial line ofresearch. His participation in this research is noticed and monitored by hismany colleagues.Nevertheless, only a week after our meeting, where Mark [Demitroff], with Chris’endorsement, had presented an evidence-based alternative to Zamora’s proposedBay impact genesis, you gave a video presentation that juxtaposed YDIH researchwith Zamora’s very controversial claim of Bay impact genesis. …Less than a month [later] … Chris Moore, probably the most important current andhopefully future investigator of the YDB event, received a call from a colleaguewho had seen your You Tube video and posted it on his anti-pseudoscience websitethat is apparently visited by some of Chris’ peers. Your presentationjuxtaposing YDIH research with Zamora’s claims certainly endowed them with someunwarranted credibility but also contaminated the YDIH by the association. Chrisachieved some unwanted negative-celebrity among his colleagues. He waschallenged about the wisdom of hosting you and suffered the indignity ofwondering about the effect the … video might have on his career and reputation.It is obvious to me that distribution of your video presentation has put Chris’sreputation, career and participation in the YDIH research in potential jeopardy… the resulting harm … has yet to be completely comprehended. Fortunately Chrismade the brave decision to continue the YDIH research, despite that video’spresence on you tube for the foreseeable future.Wow! All this stress, drama, and defensiveness over a video of a presentation Igave at a conference! I have to confess, I was taken aback by the vehemence ofLeCompte’s reply and the suggestion that I might have harmed the career of thatvery likable and diligent scientist Chris Moore.But at a deeper level what this whole exchange revealed to me was somethingdisturbing about the way science works. I hadn’t quite grasped the role of fearbefore. But I could see it in action everywhere here: fear of being “noticed andmonitored by colleagues,” fear of unwanted negative celebrity, fear ofindignity, fear of loss of reputation, fear of loss of career—and not forcommitting some terrible crime but simply for exploring unorthodox possibilitiesand undertaking “somewhat controversial research” into what everyone agrees wereextraordinary events 12,800 years ago.Worse still, this pervasive state of fear has somehow ingrained itself so deeplyinto the fabric of science that those who have embraced unorthodox possibilitiesthemselves are often among the least willing to consider unorthodoxpossibilities embraced by others—lest by doing so they “contaminate” their ownpreferred unorthdoxy.How will it ever be possible to discover the truth about the past when so muchfear gets in the way?"},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00156.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00157.jpeg]HUNTER-GATHERERS AND THE LOST CIVILIZATIONUTTERLY HORRIFIC, TROUBLING, AND CONFUSING events took place at the onset of theYounger Dryas, and more than a decade under the scientific spotlight hasrepeatedly confirmed that the best explanation of all the evidence is that theearth underwent a series of interactions with the remnants of the disintegratinggiant comet that spawned the Taurid meteor stream. These encounters are thoughtto have reached a peak 12,822 years ago but were sustained over a span of 21years beginning 12,836 years ago and ending 12,815 years ago. There were otherepisodes of bombardment around the time of the Younger Dryas onset, but this wasthe worst.Perhaps it was not a comet after all. Perhaps in the next decade some other evenmore compelling theory with even more evidence to back it up will be advanced—orperhaps some decisive new discovery will be made that vindicates one of theexisting nonimpact theories. Until that time, however, the Younger Dryas ImpactHypothesis continues to make complete sense to me and to a great manyscientists, and its 21-year window of maximum devastation, peaking around 12,822years ago, deserves special attention.Archaeological evidence from this period is scarce in North America, but whatthere is suggests that widely scattered populations of Native Americanhunter-gatherers were badly mauled at the Younger Dryas onset. Amid indicationsof sudden population collapses, many previously inhabited areas were abandonedentirely, as we saw in chapter 26, with no return for hundreds of years. Clovisceased to exist—an entire vibrant, widely distributed culture obliterated—butother humans survived and bounced back, something our species has a talent for.I’d stayed in touch with Al Goodyear since Topper and he confirmed that in hisview, while there was evidence for a “possible demographic crash/depression,”there had been no “extermination post Clovis.”1 [part0051.html#note1297]We shouldn’t be surprised.Hunter-gatherers are hard to exterminate!They roll with the punches and they bounce back.In the technology-dominated twenty-first century, the majority of humans live incities fed by intensive agriculture, but in the world today there still exists atiny minority of hunter-gatherers. Many of the urbanites enjoy great wealth andabundance while the hunter-gatherers possess very little. If a cataclysm on thescale of the Younger Dryas impacts were to strike in our lifetimes, however, Ipredict it would be these few remaining groups of hunter-gatherers—in theKalahari desert, for example, or in the Amazon rainforest—who would have thebest chance of surviving the devastating consequences, and it would be theirdescendants, not ours, who would carry the human story forward. Unlike most citydwellers who have no idea how to live off the land, hunter-gatherers are mastersof survival, they know how to deal with environmental setbacks, and no matterhow tough things get they can usually improvise a workaround. By contrast themasses in the cities, suddenly discovering that technology can’t fix everything,would be psychologically traumatized and largely helpless.Almost the opposite of our twenty-first-century world, the world as I imagine it12,800 years ago is one in which the vast majority of humans arehunter-gatherers while a minority have taken another, more complex, path. Thehunter-gatherers form populations recognized by modern archaeologists, and theirstone tools, weapons, and ornaments speak of an effective but fairly rudimentarytechnology. The minority who have taken a different path are not recognized andI contend that this is primarily because the destruction of their civilizationwas near-total, and because the few, faint, tantalizing clues to theirtechnology that have reached us across the ages hint at a level of science farin advance of anything believed by scholars to have been possible at such aremote period of prehistory.It is for this reason that ancient maps incorporating scientifically accuratelatitudes and longitudes and depicting the world as it looked during the loweredsea levels of the last Ice Age have been dismissed by the mainstream as merecuriosities with no bearing on our understanding of the origins of civilization.I looked into the mystery of these maps in Fingerprints of the Gods (1995) andagain in Underworld in 2002, and refer the reader to appendix 2 for details.Contrary to the mainstream, my broad conclusion is that an advanced globalseafaring civilization existed during the Ice Age, that it mapped the earth asit looked then with stunning accuracy, and that it had solved the problem oflongitude, which our own civilization failed to do until the invention ofHarrison’s marine chronometer in the late eighteenth century. As masters ofcelestial navigation, as explorers, as geographers, and as cartographers,therefore, this lost civilization of 12,800 years ago was not outstripped byWestern science until less than 300 years ago at the peak of the Age ofDiscovery.Suppose there was an earlier “Age of Discovery” in the centuries before theonset of the Younger Dryas, when the fleets of the lost civilization set out toopen interaction with tribes of hunter-gatherers all around the world and eitherpassed themselves off as, or were mistaken for, “gods.” I’m just offering foodfor thought here, a pure speculation, but I submit this might have followed aperiod of severely restricted involvement with other peoples—such as the Mingdynasty imposed on China in the late fourteenth century—and I suggest that therenewed outreach may have been motivated by foreknowledge of the impendingYounger Dryas cataclysm. This lost civilization, after all, appears to haveevolved a sophisticated religion deploying powerful symbolism that emphasizedthe connection between heaven and earth and that envisaged an afterlife journeythrough specific well-charted regions of the celestial vault. Itsastronomer-priests are therefore most unlikely to have missed the signs in thesky as our planet began its long journey toward intersection with a particularlylumpy and debris-filled filament of the Taurid meteor stream where the menacingserpentlike tails of the outgassing larger fragments might have served asvisible omens of the terrors to come.The astronomers and mathematicians of our hypothetical lost civilization wouldsurely have set to work calculating trajectories and orbits and would havelearned in due course that collisions with fragments of the disintegratingcomet, though not an immediate threat, were unfortunately inevitable during thecenturies ahead. It was not yet certain how large and how sustained thebombardments would be, or where and when the first fragments would strike.Multiple outcomes were possible, from escaping relatively unscathed, at one endof the scale, to a worst-case scenario in which civilization itself would besnuffed out. And although the worst would probably never happen, a contingencyplan would certainly have been prepared on the off chance that it did.My bet is the planners would have seen from the outset that the superiorsurvival skills of hunter-gatherer populations might potentially make them theinheritors of the earth in the event of a true planetary cataclysm. An importantstrand of any contingency plan, therefore, would have been to establishconnections with hunter-gatherers, to teach them, to learn from them, and in sodoing to ensure that these populations were willing and able—if called upon—tooffer refuge to the “gods” of the lost civilization.It would not be until weeks or even days before the bombardments began that theareas likely to be worst hit could be pinpointed with any certainty. There musthave been hope that by some miracle the impacts might be avoided altogether, butuntil the centuries of danger passed it was best to regard the whole world as atarget and therefore to prepare safe havens on many different continents so thatif some were destroyed others would survive. I speculated in chapter 10 thatthis process of preparation might even have involved the experimentalresettlement of groups of hunter-gatherers far from their home regions with theintention that they should create places of refuge for the “gods” in their newsurroundings. Such a project might account for that strange Australasian DNAsignal stranded in the genes of certain Amazonian tribes.In this scenario, therefore, hunter-gatherer populations all around the worldwere deliberately recruited by people from a different, more scientificallyadvanced culture to prepare for a coming cataclysm, to offer refuge to the“gods” should they require it, and perhaps even to serve as duplicatearchives—either in oral tradition or in the safekeeping of physical records—forsome of the scientific knowledge of the “gods.”In North America the evidence is that hunter-gatherers bounced back quitesuccessfully within less than a millennium of the onset of the Younger Dryas,and thereafter there is a thin but fairly continuous archaeological record. Whatis mysterious is not so much the early appearance of mound-building in this newage—perhaps as early as 8,000 years ago, as we’ve seen—or the sophistication ofsites such as Watson Brake 5,500 years ago, nor even their obvious astronomicaland geometrical connections to later vast earthworks such as Moundville andCahokia, but that in this early monumental architecture of the New World memesof geometry, astronomy, and solar alignments consistently appear that are alsofound in the early monumental architecture of the Old World at iconic sites suchas Stonehenge and the Great Pyramid of Giza. A tremendous leap forward inagricultural know-how, coupled with the sudden uptake of eerily distinctivespiritual ideas concerning the afterlife journey of the soul, also oftenaccompanies the architectural memes. It’s therefore hard to avoid the impressionthat some kind of “package” is involved here.Something designed.Something deliberately and carefully contrived to engage future generations inspecific courses of action, regarded as religious duties, that would alsoeducate them deeply in the cycles of the heavens and in the measurement andnurturing of the earth.It’s almost as though a guiding hand has been at work behind the scenes ofprehistory. If so, whether through secret groups of insider initiates or by someother means of cultural transmission, this hidden influence appears to have beenactive in the Americas since before the onset of the Younger Dryas, to haveundergone long periods of inactivity, and to have reemerged again and again atcrucial junctures to shape the direction of civilization.CLOVIS GIVEN A HELPING HAND?KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUE GLOBAL extent of the Younger Dryas impacts continues togrow. We’ve focused on the evidence from North America, but recent researchpublished in Studia Quaternaria in 2018 presents evidence of a cometary airburstover Mount Viso in Europe’s Western Alps around 12,800 years ago that raisedtemperatures instantly, in a brief pulse, to above 2,200 degrees C—almost 1,000degrees hotter than the melting point of steel.2 [part0051.html#note1298]Another 2018 study, published in the Journal of Geology, reports evidence fromAntarctica’s New Mountain, near the Taylor Glacier, that an “impact/airburst ofthe same time line as the Younger Dryas Boundary may have reached across SouthAmerica and the Pacific Ocean to the Dry Valley Mountains of Antarctica.”3[part0051.html#note1299]Image Missing [../images/00158.jpeg]As of late 2014, the Younger Dryas Boundary strewn field of impact proxies hadbeen traced across 50 million square kilometers of the earth’s surface (above).Since then YDB impact proxies have been found much more widely distributed thanpreviously reported in South America, and a 2018 study reports their discoveryin Antarctica’s Taylor Valley (inset) linked to evidence of an impact orairburst around 12,800 years ago.As more evidence of this quality continues to pour in, two significantobservations thrust themselves to the fore.First, this cataclysm, which we know to have been drawn out over 21 yearsbetween 12,836 and 12,815 years ago, was truly global, affecting regions as farapart as Greenland, the Pacific, the Americas, Europe, and Antarctica.And second, it was just the luck of the draw that North America, rather thansome other region, found itself at the epicenter of the peak bombardment.However, this had profound implications for the world because so much of thecontinent was then still covered by ice that was radically destabilized,releasing the meltwater flood that shut down the Gulf Stream and ushered in theYounger Dryas. The fact that Greenland and Europe were also severely hit andalso ice covered compounded the problem by adding to the deluge of icy meltwaterpouring into the Atlantic Ocean. There is no doubt, however, that it was thecontinental landmass of North America that suffered the worst effects of theimpacts, airbursts, shock waves, and wildfires and finally, perhaps early inthat 21-year episode of bombardment, of Antonio Zamora’s proposed storm of icyejecta. The latter, we might speculate, could even have played a role inextinguishing the wildfires, thus accounting for the fact that a single massiveepisode of biomass burning, the largest in the entire NGRIP Ice Core, isdocumented for North America right at the onset of the Younger Dryas, and thenrapidly dies down, never to recur on such a scale.4 [part0051.html#note1300]Once all this is taken into account, the severity of the extinctions in NorthAmerica seems less surprising and we can begin to understand how it was that theClovis people passed from abundance to nonexistence virtually overnight.Moreover, the Clovis phenomenon is, itself, an intriguing mystery. We’ve alreadyseen that no archaeological background has ever been found to the beautiful andsophisticated fluted points used by these remarkably successful hunter-gatherersto spear mammoths like Eloise at Murray Springs. From the moment we meet themaround 13,400 years ago to the moment of their disappearance from the recordabout 12,800 years ago, they’re equipped with their extremely effectivesignature “toolkit” of which the points are part. These Clovis tools and weaponsappear suddenly and fully formed in archaeological deposits across huge expansesof North America with no evidence, anywhere, of experiments, developments,prototypes, or, indeed, of any intermediate stages in their evolution.5[part0051.html#note1301]My guess is there’s a connection between Clovis and the lost civilization, notleast because studies of ancient DNA show the Clovis genome to be much moreclosely related to Native South Americans than to Native North Americans (seepart 3 [part0016.html#F8900-6d489586c24d4bc6a7d8fba43c80bb24]). Indeed, there’sa parallel between the rather sudden and inexplicable way that Australasiangenes turn up in the Amazon basin and the equally sudden and inexplicable waythat Clovis fluted-point technology turns up in North America.Could both have the same cause?Could the same hidden hand that transported a population of Australasian settersacross the Pacific Ocean from New Guinea to the Amazon also have given technicalassistance to one group among the many that we now know inhabited North Americabefore the onset of the Younger Dryas? And since the whole Clovis First nonsensehas finally been relegated to the dustbin of history, perhaps it’s time toconsider another possibility—let’s call it “Clovis Most Favored” or “ClovisGiven a Helping Hand.”Though in no way “high-tech” in twenty-first-century terms, the Clovis toolkitis far superior to anything else Native Americans are thought to have beencapable of 13,400 years ago when the first fluted points begin to appear southof the ice cap. I’m not proposing that these stone tools were part of thetechnology of the lost civilization itself—any more than jet aircraft were partof it. I’ve argued already that a more realistic parallel for the level ofscience and technology attained would be with Europe and the newly formed UnitedStates in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.Other than that, the civilization I envisage was very different from our own,founded upon entirely different principles. Much of its science may remainopaque to us not because it is absent but because we are unable to recognize itfor what it is. Nor is there any reason to suppose it would have shared its own“high-tech” with other peoples; quite possibly there were even specificstipulations against doing so. But there might have been less hesitation aroundthe idea of devising better, more efficient stone tools to put into the hands offavored groups of hunter-gatherers, thus conferring a competitive advantage uponthem.Suppose Clovis was such a group, already present alongside many other groupsthat we now know to have inhabited the Americas before the Younger Dryas onset.The connection to the southern lineage of Native Americans is interesting.Perhaps it might even have been in those 5 million square kilometers of Amazonrainforest where archaeologists have not yet ventured that fluted-pointtechnology was initially taught to Clovis ancestors who then migrated north,bringing “their” expertise with them.In so doing they burst in upon—and in a brief few centuries radically changed—acultural landscape that archaeologists are now beginning to realize hadpreviously been stable and continuous for thousands of years. Just as AlGoodyear discovered at Topper when he took the decision to dig down below thelowest Clovis occupation level (see chapter 6[part0015.html#E9OE0-6d489586c24d4bc6a7d8fba43c80bb24]), recent excavations atthe extremely prolific Clovis site of Gault, Texas, have likewise revealeddeeper, pre-Clovis levels. Reported in the journal Science Advances in July2018, these levels contain an assortment of stone tools—“the GaultAssemblage”—so far confirmed to be at least 2,000 years older than Clovis.Significantly, what archaeologists have identified in the assembly is “apreviously unknown, early projectile point technology unrelated to Clovis.”6[part0051.html#note1302]Of note also is that:There is a ~10-cm-thick zone of decreased cultural material between the Clovisand Gault components. This suggests a reduction in site activity or possibleoccupational breaks between … cultural depositions.7 [part0051.html#note1303] …The distinct technological differences between Clovis and Gault Assemblage,together with the stratigraphic separation between the cultural depositions,indicate a lack of continuity between the two complexes.8[part0051.html#note1304]In other words, Clovis just rather inexplicably appears and replaces preexistingnative North American cultures, and pretty soon its occupation levels areimposed over other, earlier occupation levels all across the continental UnitedStates until suddenly, and mysteriously, in the big bang of the Younger Dryasonset, Clovis itself is gone—dead and buried beneath the black mat.Yet in the brief few hundred years of its florescence, Clovis sparkled and shoneas the most successful and widespread hunter-gatherer culture thus far seen inthe Americas. Archaeologists and flint knappers who have studied the matter arein no doubt that the distinctive points, and the way that fluting was deployedin their manufacture, would have given the Clovis people a significanttechnological edge over other hunter-gatherers.9 [part0051.html#note1305] Thequestion, therefore, has to be why they were wiped out while other lessprominent and capable cultures were able to emerge from the shadows ofarchaeological invisibility and survive.Perhaps they grew too close to the “gods” of the lost civilization and sharedtheir fate?This is a serious proposition, not a frivolous question, and we may anticipatethe skeptical response. If Clovis benefited from contact with a more advancedcivilization, then we should find the skeletal remains of those more advancedpeople intermingled with the Clovis remains, and we do not—therefore, there wasno advanced civilization. Similarly, if Clovis benefited from contact with thepeople of a more advanced civilization, then we should find at least some tracesof their higher tech among the Clovis assemblages, and we do not—therefore,there was no advanced civilization.I’ve already responded to the second argument. There might have been very goodreasons why people from a more technologically advanced civilization would havedecided not to share their high-tech with hunter-gatherers, while at the sametime choosing to favor a particular group with the know-how to work existing rawmaterials like stone, antler, and bone into more efficient hunting weapons andtools than they’d ever made before.As to the first argument, although Clovis were not the “first Americans,” theirculture has been the subject of intensive archaeological study for more than 80years and we’ve seen that Clovis artifacts have been discovered in greatquantities at sites scattered far and wide across North America.But how many Clovis bones have been found alongside the artifacts? How manyskeletons, crania, tibia, phalanges, or teeth? I had imagined there must bequite a collection for such a famous and well-understood culture. I wastherefore surprised to learn during the research for this book that apart fromthe incomplete skeleton of a single individual—the Anzick-1 child excavated inMontana and discussed in chapter 9—there are no human remains at all from theClovis period.10 [part0051.html#note1306] Even in the case of Anzick-1, as we’veseen, the Clovis provenance was questioned by some until sophisticated datingtechniques in 2018 resolved an apparent discrepancy between the age of theinfant’s bones and the age of the Clovis tools found with him, placing bothfirmly at the onset of the Younger Dryas around 12,800 years ago and confirmingthe Clovis identity of the buried child.11 [part0051.html#note1307]Here then is the conundrum. At locations scattered all across North America fromAlaska to New Mexico and from Florida to the state of Washington, more than1,500 Clovis sites have been found. These sites have yielded more than 10,000Clovis points12 [part0051.html#note1308] and tens of thousands of otherartifacts from the Clovis toolkit (40,000 at Topper alone, as we saw in chapter6). Yet among all these archaeological riches, it bears repeating that the sumtotal of Clovis human remains found in 85 years of excavations is limited to theAnzick-1 partial skeleton.13 [part0051.html#note1309]In short, if the homeland of our hypothetical advanced civilization were inAmerica, and if it became a lost civilization during the tumultuous earthchanges of 12,800 years ago, then the Clovis case suggests that a dearth ofskeletal remains is a normal state of affairs by which we should not besurprised. Certainly it does not constitute disproof of the lost civilizationhypothesis.By contrast, the sudden appearance of Clovis fluted-point technology with noevidence of prior trial and error, buildup of skills, experimentation, orprototypes14 [part0051.html#note1310] cries out for an explanation. So, too,does the Australasian DNA signal in the heart of the Amazon rainforest. So, too,the shared geometry and astronomy, and the shared earthwork designs across theOld World and the New. So, too, the incredible overlaps of symbolism, spiritualinquiry, and beliefs.The only viable explanation is a remote common source behind them all—a lostcivilization, in my view. And although that civilization had establishedself-perpetuating memes that would keep the flame of its influence burning forthousands of years, it is clear that it did not survive the Younger Dryascataclysm itself.Let’s look at North America, therefore, with the possibility in mind that itmight be the “crime scene” from which a great civilization of prehistoricantiquity—the stuff of myth and legend all around the world—vanished without atrace."},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00159.jpeg]UNKNOWN UNKNOWNSA LOST ADVANCED CIVILIZATION OF the Ice Age with global navigational andmapmaking skills equivalent to our own in the late eighteenth and earlynineteenth centuries would have had the capacity to establish outposts on everycontinent but must also have had a homeland.Since that homeland has not been found after 200 years of diligent archaeology,most diligent archaeologists conclude—quite reasonably on the face ofthings—that it did not exist.But there are other options.It might be underwater now—the immense Sunda Shelf around Indonesia, forexample, submerged by sea-level rise at the end of the Ice Age.It might be under ice, perhaps in Antarctica, if we’re willing to accept thatsome rather extraordinary geophysical events occurred in the past 100,000 years.Image Missing [../images/00160.jpeg]IMAGE: EARTH 18K BCE BY DONALD L. EDWARDS.It might await rediscovery in the unexplored heart of the Amazon rainforest.It might lie beneath the sands of the Sahara desert.Or perhaps its homeland has all along remained hidden in plain view in the verylast place that anyone has thought to look—North America?There are surprisingly few “known knowns” in American prehistoric archaeologyand good reasons why there are so many “known unknowns”—reasons that in turnsuggest that the third Rumsfeldian category,1 [part0051.html#note1311] of“unknown unknowns,” the “things we don’t know we don’t know,” may ultimatelyprove to be far larger and more significant than either of the other two.First and foremost, the Younger Dryas impacts, and subsequent sustainedcataclysm, changed the face of the earth completely and wrought particularlysignificant havoc across North America. We have considered the question of hugevolumes of meltwater released into the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans from thedestabilized ice sheet and looked at the effects on global climate. But keep inmind that those enormous floods also devastated the rich North American mainlandto the south, perhaps the best and most bounteous real estate then availableanywhere.This immense and extraordinary deluge, “possibly the largest flood in thehistory of the world,”2 [part0051.html#note1312] swept away and utterlydemolished everything that lay in its path. Jostling with icebergs, choked bywhole forests ripped up by their roots, turbulent with mud and boulders swirlingin the depths of the current, what the deluge left behind can still be seen insomething of its raw form in the Channeled Scablands of the state of Washingtontoday—a devastated blank slate (described at length in Magicians of the Gods)littered with 10,000-ton “glacial erratics,” immense fossilized waterfalls, and“current ripples” hundreds of feet long and dozens of feet high.3[part0051.html#note1313]If there were cities there, before the deluge, they would be gone.If there was any evidence of anything that we would recognize as technologythere, before the deluge, it would be gone.And if an advanced antediluvian civilization had flourished anywhere within 500kilometers of the southern edge of the ice cap, not only in the ChanneledScablands but all the way along the ice margin, the flood alone might have beensufficient to ensure that not a trace of it would be left for archaeologists tomisrepresent 12,800 years later.Washington displays flood-ravaged scablands, but so, too, does New Jersey muchfarther to the east. Washington is notable for its fields and hillsides strewnwith huge ice-rafted erratics, but so, too, is the state of New York.Interestingly also, just as Washington has its coulees, New York State has itsFinger Lakes. These latter were long thought to have been carved by glaciers,but their geomorphology closely parallels that of the coulees of the channeledscablands, and some researchers now believe they were cut by glacial meltwaterat extreme pressures—a process linked by sediment evidence to “the collapse ofcontinental ice sheets.”4 [part0051.html#note1314]Image Missing [../images/00161.jpeg]Likewise in Minnesota, on the Saint Croix River, there is a spectacular array ofmore than eighty giant glacial potholes. One is 10 feet wide and 60 feet deep,making it the deepest explored pothole in the world. Others, as yet unexcavated,are even wider, and probably deeper as well. And all of them, without exception,were formed by turbulent floods at the end of the Ice Age.We are looking then at vast expanses of North America that were literallyscoured.And this is before we get to the other effects of the Younger Dryas impactsexplored in previous chapters—including direct hits on populated areas, searingheat and shock waves from airbursts, continent-wide wildfires, an impact winter,icy ejecta, and so on and so forth.All in all, if North America is where a lost civilization of prehistoricantiquity vanished, then by far the most significant problem we face ininvestigating it is the way that the “crime scene” was systematically “wipeddown” by the cataclysmic events at the onset of the Younger Dryas.WIPING DOWN THE CRIME SCENE: CONQUESTTHE EUROPEAN INVASION OF THE American mainland began 500 years ago with theSpanish conquest of Mexico. In 1519, when Hernán Cortés first set foot on theshores of the Yucatán, more than 30 million people lived in Mexico. A centurylater, after the brutal genocide of the conquest itself and immense loss of lifeto smallpox epidemics, the population had fallen to just 3 million.5[part0051.html#note1315]The entire pre-Columbian literature of Mexico, a vast library of tens ofthousands of codices, was carefully and systematically destroyed by the priestsand friars who followed in the wake of the conquistadors. In November 1530, forexample, Bishop Juan de Zumarraga, who had shortly before been appointed“Protector of the Indians” by the Spanish crown, proceeded to “protect” hisflock by burning at the stake a Mexican aristocrat, the lord of the city ofTexcoco, whom he accused of having worshipped the rain god. In the city’smarketplace Zumarraga “had a pyramid formed of the documents of Aztec history,knowledge and literature, their paintings, manuscripts, and hieroglyphicwritings, all of which he committed to the flames while the natives cried andprayed.”6 [part0051.html#note1316]More than 30 years later, the holocaust of documents was still under way. InJuly 1562, in the main square of Mani (just south of modern Merida in theYucatan), Bishop Diego de Landa burned thousands of Maya codices, storypaintings, and hieroglyphs inscribed on rolled-up deer skins. He boasted ofdestroying countless “idols” and “altars,” all of which he described as “worksof the devil, designed by the evil one to delude the Indians and to prevent themfrom accepting Christianity.”7 [part0051.html#note1317] Noting that the Maya“used certain characters or letters, which they wrote in their books about theantiquities and their sciences” he informs us:We found a great number of books in these letters, and since they containednothing but superstitions and falsehoods of the devil we burned them all, whichthey took most grievously and which gave them great pain.8[part0051.html#note1318]Any of us today interested in the truth about the past share the pain of thosehorrified Native Americans—for what, we cannot help but wonder, was written intheir lost books concerning “the antiquities and sciences” of the ancients? Whatexactly went up in smoke there?I have explored the mysteries of the Maya, and of their predecessors the Olmec,in my earlier work, so I have not retold their extraordinary story here. I willmention in passing, however, that in 1998, long before I knew of the MississippiValley civilization and its afterlife beliefs concerning the constellation Orionand the Milky Way, I drew attention in Heaven’s Mirror to a discovery byarchaeologists Jose Fernandez and Robert Cormack establishing that thesettlement core of the Maya city of Utatlan was designed “according to acelestial scheme reflected by the shape of the constellation of Orion.”9[part0051.html#note1319]Fernandez was also able to prove that all of Utatlan’s major temples “wereoriented to the heliacal setting points of stars in Orion,”10[part0051.html#note1320] and noted that the Milky Way, alongside which Orionstands, “was thought of as a celestial path connecting the firmament’s navelwith the centre of the underworld.”11 [part0051.html#note1321]This should be familiar territory to the reader by now and hopefully you canguess what comes next. “Very much like the ancient Egyptians,” I reported inHeaven’s Mirror, the Maya regarded the Milky Way as a particularly importantfeature of the heavens:They conceived of it as the road that led to their netherworld, Xibalba which,in common with other Central American peoples, they located in the sky.12[part0051.html#note1322]I also commented on Mexican traditions of the postmortem journey of the soul inwhich the deceased, just as in the ancient Egyptian Duat, would face a series ofordeals and “a final judgment in the terrifying presence of the death god.”13[part0051.html#note1323] Noting numerous other striking similarities in beliefsand symbolism around the mysteries of death and the afterlife, I concluded:In Egypt, as amongst the Maya, the stellar context involves Orion and the MilkyWay. In Egypt as in Mexico a journey through the netherworld must be undertakenby the deceased. In Egypt as in Mexico religious teachings assert that life isour opportunity to prepare for this journey—an opportunity that should under nocircumstances be wasted.14 [part0051.html#note1324]Such correspondences led me to speculate that both ancient Egypt and ancientMexico had shared in the legacy of an even more ancient cosmological religion,“wrapped up in sophisticated astronomical observations” and specifically focusedon the afterlife journey of the soul. Neither Egypt nor Mexico had originatedthis religion, nor had they transmitted it directly to one another. Rather eachof them had inherited it from a third, as yet unidentified, civilization.15[part0051.html#note1325]It was a hypothesis. What would help to strengthen it, and perhaps even confirmit, would be evidence of other civilizations with no direct relationship inwhich the same legacy could be identified.This evidence, I submit, now exists in the astonishing proximity of thereligious beliefs, iconography, and symbolism of the Mississippi Valley to thereligious beliefs, iconography, and symbolism of ancient Egypt outlined in part6. These deep structural connections are, in my view, unexplainable by any meansother than a shared legacy from a very ancient source—a source predating theseparation of peoples when the Americas became isolated from the “Old World” bythe rising oceans at the end of the Ice Age.Let’s take a brief look at the most ancient Native American book still inexistence—the Dresden Codex, so called because it’s kept in a museum in theGerman city of Dresden.16 [part0051.html#note1326]It is a thought-provoking document for many reasons, not least the scientificcharacter of the mathematics and astronomy incorporated in it. For example, theeminent Mayanist Sylvanus Griswold Morley noticed that on pages 51–58 of thecodex, “405 revolutions of the moon are set down; and so accurate are thecalculations involved that although they cover a period of nearly 33 years, thetotal number of days recorded (11,959) is only 89/100th of a day less than thetrue time computed by the best modern method.”17 [part0051.html#note1327]Also of great interest is the way that numbers set out in the Dresden Codex keepon getting longer and longer in the final pages:Until, in the so-called “serpent numbers,” a grand total of nearly twelve and ahalf million days (thirty-four thousand years) is recorded again and again …Finally, on the last page of the manuscript, is depicted the Destruction of theWorld, for which these highest numbers have paved the way.Here we see the rain serpent, stretching across the sky, belching forth torrentsof water. Great streams of water gush from the sun and the moon. The oldgoddess, she of the tiger claws and forbidding aspect, the malevolent patronessof floods and cloudbursts, overturns the bowl of the heavenly waters. Thecrossbones, dread emblem of death, decorate her skirt, and a writhing snakecrowns her head.Below, with downward-pointing spears symbolic of the universal destruction, theblack god stalks abroad, a screeching bird raging on his fearsome head. Here,indeed, is portrayed with graphic touch the final all-engulfing cataclysm.18[part0051.html#note1328]Image Missing [../images/00162.jpeg]Dresden Codex—the final page of the manuscript depicting the Destruction of theWorld. PHOTO OF PUBLIC DOMAIN ARTWORK: THE SAXON STATE LIBRARY[MSCR.DRESD.R.310].It’s curious—this mixture of science, cataclysm, and time. “Calculations farinto the past or lesser probings of the future occur in many a Maya hieroglyphictext,” notes archaeologist J. Eric S. Thompson:On [a] stela at Quiriga a date … over 90 million years ago is computed; onanother a date over 300 million years before that is given. … These are actualcomputations, stating correctly day and month positions, and are comparable tocalculations in our calendar giving the month positions on which Easter wouldhave fallen at equivalent distances in the past. The brain reels at suchastronomical figures, yet these reckonings were of sufficient frequency andimportance to require special hieroglyphs for their transcription.19[part0051.html#note1329]All that can be said for sure is that embedded in the Mayan material, togetherwith core religious beliefs very similar to those of the ancient Egyptians—andnow we know very similar to those of the ancient Mississippians also—is evidenceof an interest in complex scientific calculations and immense expanses of time.I’m reminded of the passage from the Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead, quotedin chapter 3, in which the Sun God Ra is praised for his travels through the“untold spaces” of the cosmic void “requiring millions and hundreds of thousandsof years to pass over”—a chronology on a similar order to the Mayan scheme ofthings but, one would have thought, irrelevant to the concerns of agriculturalsocieties. And the same goes for the immense geometrical mounds and enclosuresof the ancient Egyptian Duat that are matched by the immense geometrical moundsand enclosures of the Hopewell of Ohio and the immense geometrical mounds andenclosures now emerging from the Amazon rainforest.What the evidence suggests to me is that something extraordinary, something thatthe theories of mainstream archaeology cannot account for, was going on behindthe scenes of prehistory. All the indications are that Mexico, with its ancienttradition of literacy, was once a vast archive of the “antiquities and sciences”of former times and that the records the Spaniards destroyed in their zealousstupidity may have been as integral to the memory of humanity as the library ofAlexandria. I think it is very possible, had the Mayan documents survived insufficient quantities, that they would have shed light on the mystery of thelost common source of inspiration that appears to have kick-startedcivilizations in both the Old World and the New.In the event, however, out of the tens of thousands of Mayan codices inexistence in 1519 just four are still with us in the twenty-first century.20[part0051.html#note1330]After the Spanish conquest of Mexico, the conquest of Peru soon followed, againaccompanied by the destruction of a high civilization—in this case the Inca—inthe lineage of the First Americans. Though they had their quipus (a means ofcommunication and calculation using knotted string), the Inca were not aliterate people like the Maya and thus possessed no documents for the Spaniardsto destroy. As in Mexico, however, a sustained and determined effort was made tostamp out local religions and traditions and replace them with RomanCatholicism. Once again, this effort, officially sanctioned as “the extirpationof idolatry,” called for cultural destruction on a grand scale, calculated toerase the memory banks of the population within a generation or two and replacetheir deep connection to their own past with the new dispensation.21[part0051.html#note1331]The Spaniards did venture into North America, of course—most eccentrically andunproductively in the form of an expedition led by Hernando de Soto, who landedin Florida in 1539 with more than 600 men.22 [part0051.html#note1332] Afterlosing half his force along the way, de Soto spent the next 3 years until hisown death in Louisiana in 1542 wandering all over the southeast and deep southof what is now the United States, passing many of the great mound sites, andengaging in ruinous pitched battles with the locals. The most disastrousby-product of his visit, however, may have been smallpox, which hisexpeditionaries appear to have brought with them and which afterward devastatedthe indigenous population of the region.23 [part0051.html#note1333]We may say, therefore, that from its earliest days the European conquest of theAmericas was an agent of chaos, genocide, and cultural extinction for NativeAmericans and that this, too, was very much part of the process that wiped downthe “crime scene,” leaving us scratching our heads trying to make sense of thefew clues left behind.WIPING DOWN THE CRIME SCENE: WITNESS AMNESIATHE EXTIRPATION OF VITAL EVIDENCE concerning the past of our species across hugeswaths of the Americas was by no means limited to the effects of the YoungerDryas cataclysm, or to the subsequent much later cataclysms of militantChristianity and smallpox. Once the calamitous century of the initial encounterswas over, a more insidious but equally deadly process of erosion began to grinddown the little of the past that the previous millennia had spared. During thesixteenth century, apart from a few failed raids like de Soto’s, North Americawas not much affected, but from the early seventeenth century onward, followingthe first European settlements in Virginia and Massachusetts, everythingchanged.Thereafter, with monotonous, depressing regularity, either for theiragricultural potential or for the prospect of gold, lands held sacred in thepossession of Native American tribes for eons were snatched from them and theirinhabitants driven off or slaughtered. These murderous land grabs onlyaccelerated and became crueler as the seventeenth century was followed by theeighteenth and as the eighteenth century rolled on into the nineteenth:From the time Europeans arrived on American shores, the frontier—the edgeterritory between white man’s civilization and the untamed natural world—becamea shared space of vast, clashing differences that led the U.S. government toauthorize over 1,500 wars, attacks and raids on Indians, the most of any countryin the world against its indigenous people. By the close of the Indian Wars inthe late 19th century, fewer than 238,000 indigenous people remained, a sharpdecline from the estimated 5 million to 15 million living in North America whenColumbus arrived in 1492.24 [part0051.html#note1334]In his important book American Holocaust, which documents the genocide, DavidStannard, professor of American studies at the University of Hawaii, reminds usthat scholarly estimates of the size of the pre-Columbian population of theAmericas have changed radically in recent decades:In the 1940s and 1950s conventional wisdom held that the population of theentire hemisphere in 1492 was little more than 8 million—with fewer than 1million people living in the region north of present-day Mexico. Today fewserious students of the subject would put the hemispheric figure at less than 75million to 100 million (with approximately 8 million to 12 million north ofMexico), while one of the most well-regarded specialists in the field recentlyhas suggested that a more accurate estimate would be around 145 million for thehemisphere as a whole and about 18 million for the area north of Mexico.25[part0051.html#note1335]Gone forever—and good riddance—is the long-held myth of North America as apristine wilderness inhabited by a handful of “savages” when the first settlersfrom Europe arrived.Nothing could be further from the truth.The new picture, derived from a combination of archaeology, ethnography,genetics, and the reports of early travelers, is of a busy and boisterouscontinent with a growing population, widespread trade networks, and abundantresources.Like the Inca, though lacking their centralized, structured state, the NativeNorth Americans were people of the spoken word who carried their wisdom andtheir records not in documents but in oral traditions carefully nurtured,memorized, and passed on from generation to generation. Today we grope in thedark when we try to discover what they knew, what they taught, and what they hadpreserved from primeval times because the genocide inflicted upon them radicallydisrupted and in many cases completely destroyed the normal intergenerationalprocesses of transmission.The accounts of the genocide are repulsive; reading the details today leaves onestunned, nauseated, and horrified. Professor Stannard holds nothing back inAmerican Holocaust, a comprehensive record of European wickedness in theAmericas, but it’s not my purpose here to zoom in on the many massacres andbetrayals he describes, or to dwell on the horrific symptoms of the importedinfectious diseases that killed indigenous people by the millions.The point I wish to make is simply that this happened, that it was both physicaland cultural genocide, and that its long-term effect on the descendants of thosewho survived was to sever their connections to the traditions, wisdom, memories,and even the languages of their ancestors.Lest there be any doubt that cultural annihilation was always the purpose, handin hand with the continent-wide theft of land, we need only consider theshameful history of the so-called Indian boarding schools. The National NativeAmerican Boarding School Healing Coalition sets out the bare facts:Between 1869 and the 1960s, hundreds of thousands of Native American childrenwere removed from their homes and families and placed in boarding schoolsoperated by the federal government and the churches. Though we don’t know howmany children were taken in total, by 1926, the Indian Office estimated thatnearly 83% of Indian children were attending boarding schools. The U.S. Nativechildren that were voluntarily or forcibly removed from their homes, families,and communities during this time were taken to schools far away where they werepunished for speaking their native language, banned from acting in any way thatmight be seen to represent traditional or cultural practices, stripped oftraditional clothing, hair and personal belongings and behaviors reflective oftheir native culture.26 [part0051.html#note1336]A founder and advocate of the boarding schools movement, US army captain RichardHenry Pratt, summarized the spirit of the whole enterprise in a speech in 1892:A great general has said that the only good Indian is a dead one. In a sense, Iagree with the sentiment, but only in this: that all the Indian there is in therace should be dead. Kill the Indian in him and save the man.27[part0051.html#note1337]This, then, was an ethnically targeted brainwashing exercise on a giganticscale—an exercise deliberately designed to make Native Americans forget theirancient heritage. For the purposes of our inquiry here, if it were indeed fromNorth America that a lost civilization vanished, then not only has the crimescene been thoroughly wiped down but also—to extend the analogy—the principalwitnesses have been badly beaten about the head and are suffering from amnesia.WIPING DOWN THE CRIME SCENE: LAND GRABSEVEN AS THE GENOCIDE AND imposed “unremembering” gathered pace during thenineteenth and twentieth centuries, a parallel force was also active removingmany prominent physical traces—notably the great mounds and earthworks—thatNative Americans of former ages had left. This parallel force was primarilygreed for land, where the fate of the monuments was either to be plowed down foragriculture or demolished to make way for industry, housing, or commerce. Amongthe unknown unknowns of North American prehistory, therefore, is how many of themounds and earthworks were already gone—plowed under, demolished,ransacked—before responsible and thorough surveyors began to investigate themfrom about the mid-nineteenth century onward.Renowned among these early surveyors were Ephraim Squier and Edwin Davis, whoseclassic Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley, the first-ever publicationof the Smithsonian Institution, appeared in print in 1848. In their preface theynote of the mounds and earthworks that:The importance of a complete and speedy examination of the whole field cannot beover-estimated. The operations of the elements, the shifting channels of thestreams, the levelling hand of public improvement, and most efficient of all theslow but constant encroachments of agriculture, are fast destroying thesemonuments of ancient labor, breaking in upon their symmetry and obliteratingtheir outlines. Thousands have already disappeared, or retain but slight anddoubtful traces of their former proportions.”28 [part0051.html#note1338]One of the reasons that Ancient Monuments is still useful today is that itprovides the locations of many important mounds and earthworks that no longerexist. In 2011, in a paper published in American Antiquity, Jarrod Burks andRobert Cooke looked into the specific case of Ohio, where Squier and Davis hadreported “approximately 88 earthwork sites” in 1848. Perhaps because of the famebrought to them by Ancient Monuments, 16 of these sites—18 percent of thetotal—are “now preserved whole or in part within parks.” Another 18 sites (20percent) “are mostly or completely destroyed, with urban development and gravelmining being the primary destructive processes.” The remaining 54 sites (62percent) are “now invisible at the surface.”29 [part0051.html#note1339]So, to summarize, out of 88 Ohio sites put on record in 1848 by Squier andDavis, 54 are now “invisible,” 18 more are “destroyed,” and only 16 (just 18percent of the total) are still in place–implying an effective loss of 82percent or, in plain English, 82 out of every 100 sites.What, then, are we to make of David J. Meltzer’s presumably authoritativeintroduction to the 150th anniversary reissue of Ancient Monuments, whichinforms us that Ohio’s Ross County alone was estimated by Squier and Davis in1848 to contain “one hundred enclosures and five hundred mounds”?30[part0051.html#note1340]If that’s the correct figure, then all the other numbers change. Sixteen sitesremaining out of 600 is quite a different matter from 16 out of 88 and amountsto a 97 percent loss.On July 23, 2018, wanting to get to the bottom of this, I emailed Jarrod Burks,coauthor of the 2011 Antiquity paper.His first point was to remind me that the focus in his paper was not onearthworks in Ohio in general but only on those “depicted in Squier and Davis—88sites. There are many hundreds of earthwork sites (those with enclosures) inOhio … and we keep finding more.”As to the specific issue of the discrepancy between Meltzer’s figures and hisown, Burks explained:I was counting actually sites with enclosures depicted in maps in Squier andDavis. This comes from individual maps of sites, like the map of High BankWorks, and from unique sites depicted on their composite maps of selectareas—like the area around Chillicothe. For example, they show the Steel Groupsite on that map but they do not have a separate, more detailed map of Steel.So, when I say “enclosure site” I am referring to places with one through Xenclosures. Hopewell Mound Group is one site though it has several enclosures.Cedar Bank is one site that has only one enclosure. Following this approach,Squier and Davis depict 88 sites with enclosures in their maps. There is no waythere are 100 enclosure sites in Ross County, but there may be 100 enclosures.So far I have only found solid evidence for 37–38 enclosure sites in RossCounty, and this includes some previously undocumented ones we have found inaerial photos and subsequently surveyed with geophysics. In fact, most of the37–38 have been surveyed. … Still working on getting access to a few of them.The Archaeological Atlas of Ohio (William C. Mills 1914) reports 586 enclosuresites in Ohio. Many of these are unconfirmed and/or lost since 1914, but we areworking to find many of them. We have also found more not recorded in 1914. So,the total number of enclosure sites once in Ohio conservatively is 500–1000. Itcould be double or more.I had also asked Burks if he knew where I might find estimates of the sort thathe had made in Ohio for the Mississippi Valley as a whole—that is, how manymounds and earthworks remain and how many have been destroyed since themid-nineteenth century.“Getting numbers for all of the Mississippi Valley is a daunting task,” hereplied, “especially if you include mounds. There are/were many tens ofthousands of mounds in the eastern US. You might start by contacting the statehistoric preservation office in each state.”I was surprised that no archaeologist had yet done this basic legwork and thatthere was no authoritative volume or paper I could immediately be referredto—since presumably at least some measure of what has been lost must befundamental to the correct assessment of what remains. I therefore asked forconfirmation that I would be representing the facts correctly if I were to “tellmy readers that reliable figures simply don’t exist for the whole MississippiValley and that no archaeologist or other researcher has ever attempted toestimate what has been lost across the whole region as a result of agricultural,industrial and other encroachments since the mid-19th century.”Burks replied immediately:That’s a pretty broad statement. I don’t know that “no archaeologist or otherresearcher” has done that. George Milner produced a book on mounds 10–15 yearsago. Perhaps he makes a statement like that? But I doubt it given how nearlyimpossible it is to track that. For example, in Ohio we say there once were10,000+ mounds (a 19th century estimate). The state has only about 2000 thathave been recorded in the modern list. Many have been destroyed but we areconstantly recording new ones, many of which likely were known in the 19thcentury. So, hard to put numbers to it, but it’s true that many, many moundshave been destroyed.31 [part0051.html#note1341]George R. Milner’s book The Moundbuilders arrived on my desk the followingmorning, but contains no information that adds significantly to what we alreadyknow about the loss of mound sites since the nineteenth century. Nor was DavidMeltzer able to come up with a figure, observing in reply to my query that “200+years ago there was no systematic count of these earthworks, so we have no ideawhat the denominator should be for the equation of sites still extant / sitesonce present.”32 [part0051.html#note1342]The good news is that sites are still being discovered (or probably more oftenrediscovered). The bad news is that it may be “nearly impossible” to track the“many, many” that have been destroyed.All estimates are guesswork, but I suspect that Gregory Little’s diligent andthoroughly researched Illustrated Encyclopedia of Native American Mounds andEarthworks, though not a mainstream source, is close to the truth when itcalculates that 90 percent of all the Mississippi Valley sites have beendestroyed and that only 10 percent remain.33 [part0051.html#note1343]And lest such a ballpark figure sound too extreme let us remember, despite theconservationist rhetoric of our supposedly more enlightened age, that mounds andearthworks are still being destroyed in the twenty-first century.Walmart seems to have a penchant for this. In 2001, for example, the FentonMounds, a pair of Native American burial mounds in Fenton, Missouri, datedbetween AD 600 and 1400, were leveled to make way for a Walmart Supercenter.34[part0051.html#note1344] A few years later, in August 2009, city leaders inOxford, Alabama, approved the destruction of a 1,500-year-old Native Americanceremonial mound because, once again, Walmart wanted the location.35[part0051.html#note1345] The developers began work, removing a substantialsection of the mound, but a month later, following a public outcry, the mediareported a change of heart:A re-consecration ceremony was held this past weekend at a damaged Indian moundin Oxford, Alabama. … The 1,500-year-old sacred and archaeologically significantsite was partially demolished during a taxpayer-funded economic developmentproject, with the excavated dirt to be used as fill for construction of a Sam’sClub, a retail warehouse store owned by Walmart.36 [part0051.html#note1346]What’s indicated here is a state of mind across a segment of the Americanpopulation that sees no inherent cultural value in antiquities and believesfirmly that the past has nothing to teach us that outweighs our need for yetanother large store. I don’t mean to pick on Americans. Exactly the same stateof mind exists in Britain, France, China, and virtually every other country inthe world.By encouraging disdain for the past, however, the cost of such an outlook infast-growing America since the nineteenth century has been the mass destructionof ancient sites, notably including the loss of many thousands of the mounds andearthworks of the Mississippi Valley. Exactly how many thousands will probablyremain a “known unknown” forever. But whatever the true number, it representsyet another level at which the “crime scene” of ancient America has been wipeddown.WIPING DOWN THE CRIME SCENE: BAD ARCHAEOLOGYTHOSE OF US WHO EXPLORE alternative approaches to prehistory are frequentlyaccused by archaeologists and their friends in the media of being“pseudoscientists.” What, however, could provide a better example of trulydamaging and misleading pseudoscience than the “Clovis First” paradigm thatruled American archaeology for more than 40 years with a wholly false doctrinetaught to generations of students as fact? We saw in part 2 how thispseudoscientific theory of the peopling of the Americas, based on wildlyirresponsible extrapolations from tiny data sets yet promoted by a powerfullobby of leading archaeologists, was, for a very long while, held to be soright, so correct, and so self-evidently true that any researchers whoquestioned it faced ridicule, ostracism by their colleagues, withdrawal ofresearch grants, and ruined careers.This kind of behavior in scholarship not only fails to serve the truth butactively undermines the search for it and, as such, has also played asignificant part in wiping down the ancient American “crime scene.” How much wasmissed, and has since been built over or plowed under during those 40-plus yearswhen it was considered heresy to investigate deposits older than Clovis forsigns of a human presence? And how much wide-ranging and open-mindedinvestigation into the true age and origins of the First Americans was postponedor entirely nipped in the bud at the same time? How many unexplored avenues dowe owe to the absurd Clovis First dogma? How many doors did it close on how manypromising initiatives? And how much public interest and curiosity in otherpossibilities did the pat answer “Clovis First” snuff out?It’s been the same problem with another archaeological theory—the so-calledPleistocene Overkill theory whereby all the megafauna were supposedlyslaughtered by those same ruthlessly efficient Clovis hunters (who neverthelessproved insufficiently ruthless and efficient to survive the Younger Dryasonset). I’ve not gone into the details here—just too much academic bickering toimpose upon the reader—but this theory, also, though not yet quite as dead as“Clovis First” (since it still has some advocates), has been “conclusivelyrejected” by increasing numbers of scholars in recent years.37[part0051.html#note1347]Although he lists archaeology and North American prehistory among his fields ofstudy, Terry Jones, professor and department chair of social sciences atCalifornia Polytechnic State University, brings the benefit of an outsider’sperspective when he observes:The Paleoindian Period (often defined as anything pre-dating 10,000 cal BP[i.e., 10,000 years ago]) is basically the domain of a small number ofspecialists who interpret it for everyone else. For the last 40 years theseresearchers have focused their interpretations on two closely related andintricately inter-connected theories: Clovis First and Pleistocene Overkill.During this time, Paleoindian research has also deteriorated into an intense ifnot hostile debate over these two competing but not mutually exclusive ideas.Much of the energy in this protracted dialog has been devoted to debunking ornullifying alternative hypotheses associated with these two theories. While thisis standard practice in science, the degree to which the Paleoindian debate hasbeen focused on deconstruction of opposing ideas rather than development ofempirically solid, new ones has been extreme.38 [part0051.html#note1348]This, too, is part of the wiping down of the North American “crime-scene.” Somelimited but perhaps case-breaking clues to what really happened here around12,800 years ago may remain. To the extent that the “detectives” involved inthis paleo-CSI are more interested in ego contests than the truth, however, thetruth may take a very long time to emerge.Besides, there’s another aspect to the problem in the visceral resistance shownby a number of influential scholars to any suggestion that a cataclysm of anykind ushered in the onset of the Younger Dryas. These scholars themselvesapparently believe, and so far as possible would like us to believe, thatnothing really bad happened at the Younger Dryas Boundary—that, yes, there wereextinctions, and yes, Clovis abruptly disappeared, but there is no mystery here,just a fairly routine and predictable combination of overkill and climatechange. Terry Jones, a member of the Comet Research Group, refutes suchreasoning at length in a paper in the Journal of Cosmology39[part0051.html#note1349] and strongly advocates the Younger Dryas ImpactHypothesis, which, he points out:has been introduced into North American archaeology at a time when the failingsof the overkill model have been acknowledged by the majority of researchers. …Alternatives to overkill have long been focused on climate change associatedwith the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, but this idea has always beenproblematic because large animal populations had lived through previousinterglacials without massive die offs. Something different seems to havehappened in North America at the end of the Pleistocene, and that something wasnot a blitzkrieg by human hunters.An extraterrestrial impact event seems to provide an exceptionally parsimoniousexplanation for a variety of patterns in the archaeological and paleontologicalrecords that are not accommodated by overkill.40 [part0051.html#note1350]IN THE CROSSHAIRSANOTHER “PATTERN” FOR WHICH THE YDIH provides a parsimonious explanation isformed by the deep structural connections demonstrated in part 6 between thespiritual beliefs and “astro-geometry” of the ancient Egyptians and thespiritual beliefs and “astro-geometry” of the ancient Mississippians. The caseI’ve sought to make throughout this book is that these two river valleycivilizations were among several in the ancient world that inherited a sharedlegacy of knowledge and ideas from an earlier, “lost” civilization. Regardlessof when that legacy was activated, or how its integrity was preserved over themany generations before it first manifests in the archaeological record, I’veargued that its origins go back to the last Ice Age and predate the physicalseparation of the Old World from the New. The additional element of parsimonythat the YDIH brings to this case, therefore, comes in the form of theimpact-related earth changes documented at the Younger Dryas Boundary. Theseinvolved not only radical climate change and sea-level rise, not only globalwildfires and a subsequent “impact winter,” not only mass extinctions of largeanimal species and the abrupt disappearance of Clovis but also, in thecombination of all these ills, a realistic mechanism deadly, substantial,drastic, and sustained enough to devastate and destroy even a technologicallyadvanced civilization.If a disaster on such a scale were to recur today, our civilization would notsurvive it and all our works would crumble into ruin within a few millennia. Itherefore see no reason in principle why the global cataclysm indicated in theGreenland ice cores that we know unfolded at the onset of the Younger Dryasbetween 12,836 and 12,815 years ago should not have brought an end to thatprevious high civilization of the “Early Primeval Age of the Gods”—thecivilization of the “Ancient Ones,” the civilization of the “First Time”—that isrecalled with awe in myths and traditions from all around the world.Although there were significant impacts in Greenland, the Pacific, SouthAmerica, Antarctica, Europe, and the Near East, the evidence points conclusivelytoward North America as the epicenter of the Younger Dryas cataclysm and to theNorth American ice cap specifically as the target for the largest swarm of cometfragments.Almost by default, therefore, although the crime scene has been brutallycompromised, and although the lead investigators have a priori ruled thepossibility out, North America is the most likely location on earth where acivilization could have thrived during the Ice Age and been destroyed at theonset of the Younger Dryas.Not only that. If the Edfu Texts contain a record of these events, as I haveproposed, then we should take seriously the message they transmit, that therewere survivors of the cataclysm who made it their mission to bring about:The resurrection of the former world of the gods. … The re-creation of adestroyed world. 41 [part0051.html#note1351]These survivors are said to have wandered the earth, setting out and buildingsacred mounds wherever they went, and teaching the fundamentals of civilization,including religion, agriculture, and architecture. In Heaven’s Mirror (1998) Ispeculate that it is perhaps as a result of their efforts that we find the basicdoctrines of the same sky-ground religion, essentially the same beliefs aboutthe afterlife journey of the soul, and the same architectural and geometricalprinciples as far afield as South America, Easter Island, Micronesia, Japan,Cambodia, India, Mesopotamia, Egypt, Malta, Spain, and Britain.Image Missing [../images/00163.jpeg]Turtle Island.Because the earth is a sphere it is technically true that any point could beselected as central to the radiation of these ideas. As I’ve been researchingthis book, however, my perspective has changed and what I see now when I look atthe globe are two great oceans, the Atlantic on one side and the Pacific on theother, with the longitudinal sprawl of the Americas running between them andforming, literally, the center of the world.North America, we now know, was scoured, burned, frozen, and flooded by theYounger Dryas cataclysm and has since been systematically ransacked by Westerngreed and poorly served by Western scholars. Although less severely affected bythe impacts of the Younger Dryas, South America also suffered all theseassaults. And just as in North America, where millions of square kilometers havebeen rendered opaque to archaeologists because the “crime scene” has been sosuccessfully wiped down, so, too, in South America we have 5 million squarekilometers of the Amazon rainforest that remain almost as unfamiliar toarchaeology as the dark side of the moon.The two great continents of the Americas are not separate and have never beenseparate, either before or after the Ice Age. North America is in itself a hugelandmass, with vast regions where little or no archaeology has ever been done.If a lost civilization was here in the Ice Age we cannot rule out thepossibility that its physical artifacts and remains might yet be found. Giventhat many Native American cultures share myths of the destruction of a formerworld, a subterranean interval in the womb of the earth, and then an emergenceinto our present world,42 [part0051.html#note1352] the most fruitful directionin which to look might be for places of shelter and refuge deep underground.The other region with immense scope for further inquiry is the Amazon. WhenNorth America passed through that cataclysmic episode between 12,836 and 12,815years ago, South America would have seemed like the obvious place for survivorsof the lost civilization to take refuge. This would have been all the morelikely if, as I speculate, South American hunter-gatherers had already been“adopted” and gifted with useful know-how in much the same way that Clovisappears to have been.Even if the human story is badly broken in North America, with big piecesobviously missing, it’s possible that a more complete account awaits us in theAmazon.I can hear the mainstream protests already: “The whole idea of a lostcivilization is nonsense!” “Pseudoscience!” “A waste of research funds!”But the mainstream, which has wasted research funds for decades fruitlesslypursuing nonsensical fantasies like “Clovis First,” should have learned by nowto keep an open mind."},{"pageContent":"Image Missing [../images/00164.jpeg]THE KEY TO EARTH’S LOST CIVILIZATIONSINCE I BEGAN WORK ON Fingerprints of the Gods in the early 1990s I’ve been anadvocate for the unorthodox notion that an advanced civilization flourishedduring the Ice Age and was destroyed in the cataclysms that brought the Ice Ageto an end. I’ve written my books to make the case and provide supportingevidence for this possibility. I’ve suggested a number of locations that I feelwould be worth looking into—including, most controversially, Antarctica—and Iinvested nearly 10 years of my life in arduous and sometimes highly riskyscuba-diving adventures searching for man-made structures submerged by risingsea levels at the end of the Ice Age.So I’ve walked the walk, but it’s been a bit like tracking the Invisible Man.There are signs of his presence everywhere—he has touched this, he has reshapedthat, this was how he did mathematics, these were his beliefs—but the Manhimself remains concealed. There’s not even the option to guess the appearanceand character of the lost civilization by wrapping its face in bandages like thehero of the H. G. Wells novel. It’s much more elusive. Physical traces thatmight point to its homeland have either been so completely demolished or sothoroughly hidden from view that they are extremely difficult to find,especially so by an archaeological community already preconvinced of theirnonexistence and therefore unwilling to look for them.What’s tantalizing, however, is that the influence of the lost civilizationdeclares itself repeatedly in the commonalities shared by supposedly unconnectedcultures all around the ancient world. The deeper you dig, the more obvious itbecomes that they did not get these shared features from one another but from aremote common ancestor of them all. We see only the effects and modes ofexpression of that inheritance, not its source, and all searches for the key tothe mystery have thus far been in vain.My proposal, simply, is that America offers us that key, and that it does sobecause of the unique circumstances of its prehistory. Unlike the interconnectedlandmasses of Africa and Eurasia, and unlike Australia, which was relativelyaccessible by sea from the extreme southeast of Asia, we’ve seen that theAmericas were isolated during much of the Ice Age—a geological epoch thatlasted, let us not forget, from around 2.6 million years ago until around 12,000years ago.1 [part0051.html#note1353] In this long geological epoch, however,there were several periods of temporary climate warming when the macro-continentof North, Central, and South America would have become accessible. Two of theseperiods of enhanced accessibility occurred within the known time frame of pasthuman migrations and it is the most recent (the so-called Bølling-Allerødinterstadial, dated from around 14,700 years ago to around 12,800 years ago2[part0051.html#note1354]) that archaeologists focused their attention on for fartoo long in their attempts to reconstruct the true story of the peopling of theAmericas. I think paleontologist Tom Deméré is on to something HUGE with thisplea that he makes to the scientific community, discussed in chapter 5:what we’re saying to everyone, really, is open your mind to the possibility thatinstead of the peopling of the Americas being associated with the lastdeglaciation event [the Bølling-Allerød interstadial] … what we should actuallybe looking at is the deglaciation event before that—between 140,000 and 120,000years ago.3 [part0051.html#note1355] You get the same sort of scenario with alandbridge and ice sheets retreating and you get that same sweet spot betweenreally low sea levels and a blockage by ice sheets, and ice sheets gone and theflooding of the landbridge.Deméré’s suggestion still remains unpalatable to some archaeologists, yet itsatisfactorily explains the growing mass of evidence that the Americas werepeopled many tens of millennia before the Bølling-Allerød interstadial (seechapters 4 [part0013.html#CCNA0-6d489586c24d4bc6a7d8fba43c80bb24], 5[part0014.html#DB7S0-6d489586c24d4bc6a7d8fba43c80bb24], and 6[part0015.html#E9OE0-6d489586c24d4bc6a7d8fba43c80bb24]). More than that, thishitherto unimagined possibility of a very old (rather than very young) humanpresence in the New World helps make sense of the complex genetic heritage ofNative Americans—explored in chapters 7, 8, 9, and 10. Embedded in this evidenceis the mind-dilating mystery of the strong Australasian DNA signal present amongcertain isolated tribes of the Amazon rainforest. It’s a recent discovery andhighly significant because it raises the possibility, as discussed in chapter10, that transoceanic voyages were being undertaken more than 12,000 years ago—anotion hitherto considered impossible by archaeologists. If the technology andgeodetic know-how to make such voyages were indeed present in the world duringthe Ice Age (see appendix 2[part0048.html#1DOR00-6d489586c24d4bc6a7d8fba43c80bb24]), then we are, bydefinition, dealing with a lost civilization.And this of course brings us to the mystery of the Amazon itself. Was it in someway “touched” by a civilization advanced enough to have explored all the world’soceans during the Ice Age? And if so, has any evidence of that influenceremained? In chapters 11 through 17 I address these questions and presentevidence that human settlement in the Amazon is extremely ancient, that greatcities and large populations once flourished there, that ancient scientificknowledge of the properties of plants persists among Amazonian peoples to thisday, that there was very early domestication of useful agricultural species,that the rainforest itself is an anthropocentric, cultivated, ordered “garden,”and that a “miraculous” man-made soil—terra preta—was developed in the Amazon indeep antiquity, bringing fertility to otherwise agriculturally unproductivelands and imbued with astonishing powers of self-renewal that modern scientistsmarvel at and do not yet fully understand.In parallel, and again a recent discovery, is the presence of giganticgeometrical earthworks and astronomically aligned stone circles in the Amazon. Ishow in chapters 15 and 16 that these remarkable structures share significantscientific “memes” with the henges and stone circles of the British Isles andwith other works of ancient, sacred architecture all around the world. I suggestthis is not coincidental, nor due to the direct influence of one region upon theother, but that it bears witness instead to a shared legacy, a shared package ofsacred geometrical and astronomical blueprints, inherited in both these widelyseparated regions from an earlier civilization lost to history.Chapter 17 returns to the theme of plant gnosis in the Amazon, looks into themysteries of the vision-inducing brew ayahuasca, and hears the words ofayahuasca shamans, who see geometric patterns as portals to other realms ofexistence—specifically to the afterlife realm or land of the dead.Indeed, the very name ayahuasca means “Vine of the Dead” or “Vine of Souls.”In chapters 18 through 21 I explore the deep structural similarities between theAmazonian geoglyphs and the great mounds and geometric earthworks of theMississippi Valley. It’s not simply a matter of appearances. Mississippianreligious ideas, like those of the ancient Amazon, were focused on the mysteryof death and on certain very specific notions concerning the afterlifejourney—and destination—of the soul.I show that these notions are extremely ancient in North America and trace themback into remote prehistory through a succession of sites such as Poverty Point,Lower Jackson Mound, Watson Brake, and Conly, where the same astronomical andgeometric “memes” consistently reappear.Chapter 22 recounts my own close encounter, as a teenager, with the mystery ofdeath and how my interest in this mystery was reawakened when I first studiedthe Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead many years later. I describe the Duat, theafterlife realm as depicted by the ancient Egyptians, and the soul’s ascent tothe constellation Orion and thence through a portal, or “doorway in the sky,” toa journey along the Milky Way. And I describe my astonishment, on a visit toMoundville in Alabama, to learn that what appeared to be exactly the same systemof ideas involving Orion, the Milky Way, and a journey to the realm of the deadwas also a predominant motif of the Mississippian civilization.In chapters 23 and 24 I offer a detailed investigation of Mississippian andancient Egyptian ideas concerning the afterlife journey—and destiny—of the soul.The parallels, in my view, are too remarkable, too many, and too detailed to beexplained by coincidence. Nor do they point to a direct influence of ancientEgypt on the Mississippian civilization or vice versa—chronologically impossiblebecause they existed at completely different times. As with the geoglyphs, whatis indicated here is a legacy of ideas inherited in both these widely separatedareas from a remote common source as yet unidentified by archaeologists.Could that common source, that lost civilization, have had its Ice Age homelandin North America?I set out to answer that question in chapters 25 through 27, where I presentdetailed evidence of the immense cataclysm that shook the earth around 12,800years ago—a cataclysm that was global in its consequences but that had itsepicenter in North America.For more than two decades, while eliciting patronizing sneers and sometimesextreme hostility from the scholarly establishment, I’ve consistently maintainedthat “my” proposed lost civilization was erased from history in a globalcataclysm somewhere around 12,500 years ago. At first, the very suggestion thatthere had been a cataclysm at all, and that it might be of immense relevance tothe past of our species, was singled out for particular ridicule, but then camea mass of new evidence that shifted the balance of the argument decisively.Within the resolution limits of radiocarbon calibration (where at such a removemargins of error of two or three centuries are the norm), the date for thecataclysm of around 12,500 years ago that I first put into print in 1995 isextremely close to the date of around 12,800 years ago that scientists have muchmore recently established for the impacts of multiple fragments of the giantdisintegrating comet that precipitated the catastrophic onset of the YoungerDryas.It seems, then, that there was a global cataclysm—and at more or less the verytime I had proposed.But so what? Just because I got lucky on the timing of the cataclysm doesn’tmean I was right that it wiped out an advanced prehistoric civilization. Show usits homeland, the skeptics therefore quite reasonably demanded.This book is, in part, my response to that challenge.MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME FOR A CIVILIZATION TO DEVELOPHITHERTO ICE AGE NORTH AMERICA has been seen as an uninhabited archaeologicalvacuum, awaiting the arrival of culture with the first human migrations acrossthe Bering land bridge. Because of the entrenched belief that these migrationscame relatively late, at a time when our ancestors had been “out of Africa” andalready established in Europe, Asia, and Australia for tens of millennia, therewas no reason to seek the origins of civilization in such an unlikely place. Inthe light of the new evidence on the very ancient peopling of the Americas thatwe have explored, however, and of the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis, I suggestthat the balance of the argument has once again shifted decisively. Whereasbefore it was reasonable to ask why the homeland of the lost civilization shouldhave been in North America, the more pertinent question today is why should itnot have been in North America—the continent that suffered more severedisruption than any other and that had so much of its rich prehistory pounded,pulverized, and swept away by the devastating events of 12,800 years ago.Not for the first time in this investigation I’m reminded of what Tom Demérétold me when he showed me the finds from the Cerutti Mastodon Site at The Nat inSan Diego:If you go to a place and you absolutely rule out in advance that humans werethere 130,000 years ago, then you’re clearly not going to find evidence thatthey were. But if you go with an open mind and dig deep enough in the rightplaces, then who knows what you might turn up.Tom was talking about the conclusion that he and his team had reached concerningthe mastodon remains now on show in his museum, namely, as we saw in chapter 5,that they had been scavenged by human beings 130,000 years ago. His point wasthat an ingrained perception that no humans could have reached the Americas bysuch an early date had for too long inhibited investigation of alternativescenarios—and that perhaps much more evidence of a very early presence would befound if a more targeted and determined search were made.Using rocks intelligently to smash mastodon femurs so that the marrow can beextracted is certainly not the work of a lost civilization of any kind. It isthe work of ancestral humans, perhaps anatomically modern, perhaps not. But thereal importance of the Cerutti Mastodon Site is that it provides the first solidevidence—solid enough to make it into the pages of Nature—of a truly ancienthuman occupation of the New World. If humans were in North America 130,000 yearsago (more than twice as long as the span of the known human presence in Europe),that gives them 117,000 years to have evolved a high civilization before theYounger Dryas cataclysm struck.And why should they not have done so? What is particularly special or inviolableabout the so-called march toward civilization that seems to begin with the onsetof the Neolithic at the end of the Younger Dryas? Why did it happen then and notbefore? Why shouldn’t there have been an earlier “march towards civilization”that began with an earlier peopling of the Americas—not with the lastdeglaciation event but, as Tom Deméré suggested, with “the deglaciation eventbefore that, between 140,000 and 120,000 years ago?”Thereafter, until the next episode of deglaciation (the Bølling-Allerødinterstadial) in the 2,000 years immediately preceding the Younger Dryas, allscholars agree that the vast landmass of the Americas, straddling half theglobe, was cut off from the rest of the world by the Atlantic and Pacific Oceansand by mountains of ice. Migrants from Asia, even when Beringia was accessible,could not get in. But for those humans who were already south of the ice cap120,000 years ago, the Americas must have been a paradise, safe from incursionsby any other peoples and blessed with an astonishing abundance and variety ofnatural resources. The New World offered conditions utterly different from thoseavailable on any other continent, so I see no reason why the very first of theFirst Americans should not also have followed a radically different path fromother humans—a path that more rapidly veered away from hunting and gathering andthat led ultimately to the emergence of a precociously early civilization.MYSTERIOUS POWERSIF THE YOUNGER DRYAS EARTH changes wiped a prehistoric civilization from therecord, then can anything useful ever be said about the character of thatcivilization?Thus far (extrapolating from the belief systems of its descendants) I’vesuggested that its spirituality must have involved profound explorations of themystery of death. I’ve suggested that accurate ancient maps depicting the earthas it looked during the Ice Age imply that it had developed a level of maritimetechnology at least as advanced as that possessed by European seafarers in thelate eighteenth century. I’ve suggested that it had mastered sophisticatedgeometry and astronomy. I’ve also suggested that such a “lost” civilization,maturing in isolation for tens of thousands of years in North America, mighthave taken a very different path from our own and might have developedtechnologies that archaeologists would be unable to recognize because theyoperated on principles or manipulated forces unknown to modern science.In his 1920 study The Interpretation of Radium, Nobel Prize winner FrederickSoddy, one of the pioneers of nuclear physics, speculated as to the formerexistence of “a wholly unknown and unsuspected ancient civilization of which allother relic has disappeared.”4 [part0051.html#note1356] He drew attention to theseemingly limitless stores of nuclear energy that were in his time understood tobe possessed by certain elements such as radium and compared these to thefabulous “philosopher’s stone” credited in ancient traditions with mysteriouspowers of transmutation and regeneration. The similarity, he felt, was nocoincidence but “an echo from one of many previous epochs in the unrecordedhistory of the world”5 [part0051.html#note1357]:Can we not read into [such traditions] … justification for the belief that someformer forgotten race of men attained not only to the knowledge we have sorecently won, but also to the power that is not yet ours? Science hasreconstructed the story of the past as one of a continuous Ascent of Man to thepresent-day level of his powers. In face of the circumstantial evidence existingof this steady upward progress of the race, the traditional view of the Fall ofMan from a higher former state has come to be more and more difficult tounderstand. From our new standpoint the two points of view are by no means soirreconcilable as they appeared. A race which could transmute matter would havelittle need to earn its bread by the sweat of its brow. If we can judge fromwhat our engineers accomplish with their comparatively restricted supplies ofenergy, such a race could transform a desert continent, thaw the frozen polesand make the whole world one smiling Garden of Eden. Possibly they could evenexplore the outer realms of space. … The legend of the Fall of Man … may be allthat has survived of such a time before, for some unknown reason, the wholeworld was plunged back again under the undisputed sway of Nature, to begin oncemore its upward toilsome journey through the ages.6 [part0051.html#note1358]In the 2020s (as would not have been the case in the 1920s) there’s a goodchance archaeologists would recognize an ancient technology designed to exploitnuclear power—and if they didn’t, they would certainly be able to call insomeone who did. This is because our own science has now advanced to a levelwhere nuclear power is familiar to us. By contrast, Soddy’s imagining of a losthigh civilization of prehistoric antiquity that had fully penetrated themysteries of the atom was written in the infancy of our risky dance withnukes—25 years before Hiroshima and Nagasaki and 35 years before the firstnuclear power stations came online. A man of his time, therefore, when thealmost magical potential of the new technology was becoming apparent but whenits downsides were largely unknown, Soddy was all idealism. He could not haveanticipated that the immense power of the atom, once fully harnessed, wouldnever be used to transform deserts, thaw the poles, or “make the whole world onesmiling Garden of Eden,” but would instead be deployed primarily for destructivepurposes in the form of bombs and missiles, or for generating electricity at thelong-term cost of poisoning the earth.It is not necessarily the case that an earlier advanced civilization would havechosen the nuclear path so enthusiastically envisaged for it by Soddy. Nor mustit inevitably have taken the path of leverage and mechanical advantage thathistorical civilizations have so doggedly trudged down for the past few thousandyears on their way to the “machine age.” I return again to my point. Since weare considering the possibility of “a wholly unknown and unsuspectedcivilization,” we must also consider the possibility that it might havedeveloped wholly unknown and unsuspected ways of manipulating matter andenergy—which we might therefore be unable to recognize even if the evidence wasright before our eyes.Perhaps this is why modern archaeologists, trained to analyze ancientconstruction techniques through the reference frame of leverage and mechanicaladvantage, are unable to provide convincing explanations for a number ofsignificant architectural problems of the ancient world.Take the case of the massive beams, quarried from solid granite and weighing inthe range of 70 tons each, incorporated into the core of Egypt’s Great Pyramidin the series of “relieving chambers” stacked on top of the “King’s Chamber”more than 50 meters (164 feet) above ground level. None of the wishful scholarlyclaims of megaliths somehow being slid “easily” into place on wooden rollers oron lubricated sand will work at this elevation. The fact of the matter is thatthe hulking beams forming the floors and ceilings of the relieving chambers arewhere they are—and that in order to get there they had to be lifted more than 50meters into the air.Or consider the Trilithon at Baalbek in Lebanon. Here, 20 feet above the ground,three immense ashlars weighing more than 800 tons each have been placed end toend within a wall of smaller blocks and so tightly fitted that the joints canbarely be seen. It wouldn’t be an easy feat even with twenty-first-centurytechnology, so how could it possibly have been accomplished thousands of yearsago?Let us also not forget the marvel of Sacsayhuamán, perched on a ridge above thecity of Cuzco in the Peruvian Andes at an altitude of 3,700 meters (12,140feet). I have made the case in previous books that this supposed Inca site wasalready enormously ancient at the time of the Incas and has been wronglyattributed to them. Of particular relevance here are its colossal megalithicwalls arranged in a series of zigzags and consisting of intricately formedpolygonal blocks. No two blocks among the thousands at Sacsayhuamán are the sameshape, some weigh more than 300 tons, and all are so tightly interlocked in alldimensions that the edge of a piece of paper cannot be slipped between thejoints. Efforts by archaeologists to reconstruct how the work at Sacsayhuamánwas done have proved as ludicrous as a failed attempt in 1978 to build amidget-size scale model of the Great Pyramid—and once again this is because theonly reference frame deemed acceptable, involving leverage and mechanicaladvantage, is unable to account for many of the more complex anomalies.There is an answer, but it involves looking outside the box.At the Great Pyramid, at Baalbek, and at Sacsayhuamán, as well as at numerousother mysterious sites (such as the almost unbelievable Kailasa Temple, hewn outof solid basalt at Ellora in the Indian state of Maharashtra), intriguingancient traditions persist. These traditions speak of meditating sages, the useof certain plants, the focused attention of initiates, miraculously speedyworkmanship, and special kinds of chanting or tones played on musicalinstruments in connection with the lifting, placing, softening, and moulding ofmegaliths. My guess, confronted by the global distribution of such narrativesand by the stark reality of the sites themselves, is that we’re dealing with thereverberations of an ancient technology we don’t understand, operating onprinciples that are utterly unknown to us.Soddy, imagining a lost civilization that had developed machines powered bynuclear energy, speaks of exploring the outer realms of space and manipulatingthe global climate, but I beg to differ. I don’t think nuclear power wasinvolved and I don’t think machines were involved, either. As I near the end ofmy life’s work, and of this book, I suppose the time has come to say in printwhat I have already said many times in public Q&A sessions at my lectures, thatin my view the science of the lost civilization was primarily focused upon whatwe now call psi capacities that deployed the enhanced and focused power of humanconsciousness to channel energies and to manipulate matter.Although psi research is still undertaken at a small number of universities andinstitutes in Britain, the United States, and Russia, it is generally ridiculedand sidelined by modern mainstream scientists. This categorically does not meanthat “there’s nothing to psi” but instead speaks volumes about the nature ofscience today, which is heavily dominated by materialist thinkers whosereference frame has little room for “spooky action at a distance.” The phrase(which was Einstein’s) refers specifically to the paradoxes of quantumentanglement but applies equally well to other alleged “non-local” phenomenasuch as: 1. telepathy (“communication from one person to another of thoughts, feelings, desires, etc, involving mechanisms that cannot be understood in terms of known scientific laws”); 2. remote viewing (“the practice of seeking impressions about a distant or unseen target, purportedly using extrasensory perception”); 3. telekinesis (“the movement of a body caused by thought or willpower without the application of physical force”); 4. healing powers (whereby patients are successfully cured of their ailments by nonphysical and nonmedical means)My speculation, which I will not attempt to prove here or to support withevidence but merely present for consideration, is that the advanced civilizationI see evolving in North America during the Ice Age had transcended leverage andmechanical advantage and learned to manipulate matter and energy by deployingpowers of consciousness that we have not yet begun to tap. In action such powerswould look something like magic even today and must have seemed supernatural andgodlike to the hunter-gatherers who shared the Ice Age world with thesemysterious adepts.Keep in mind that we are talking about a Native American civilization growing tomaturity at some point during the long interval between the scavenging of theCerutti mastodon 130,000 years ago and the cataclysmic onset of the YoungerDryas 12,800 years ago. Though we may never know what set it on its ownbrilliant, idiosyncratic path, there is every reason to suppose that its peoplewould have been closely related genetically, linguistically—and at firstculturally—to other early Native American populations who remained at thehunter-gatherer stage. It follows, therefore, if this hypothetical civilizationhad sciences, that they should be rooted and grounded in a recognizably NativeAmerican reference frame, and therefore would likely have developed under theguidance of shamans and using the methods of shamanism.Telepathy, telekinesis, remote viewing, and healing powers are, of course, allcapacities believed to be within the repertoire of master shamans. Indeedayahuasca, which lies at the heart of Amazonian shamanism, first enteredmainstream Western consciousness under the name Telepathine. In 1952, forexample, on a quest in Ecuador for the visionary brew, William Burroughs wrote[his spellings; emphasis mine] that he had failed to “score for Yage,Bannisteria caapi, Telepathine, ayahuasca—all names for the same drug.”7[part0051.html#note1359]He was determined to find it, however, because of its “tremendous implications”and the “mystery” surrounding it, adding, “I’m the man who can dig it.”8[part0051.html#note1360]The reason behind the choice of the name Telepathine, which began to be appliedto ayahuasca as early as 1905,9 [part0051.html#note1361] was that Amazoniantribes making regular use of the brew repeatedly stated that it facilitatedtelepathic communication. The mechanistic Western mind of the twenty-firstcentury scoffs at such claims, but leading ayahuasca researcher Benny Shanon,professor of psychology at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, concedes that“reports of paranormal experiences with Ayahuasca abound:”Practically everyone who has had more than a rudimentary exposure to the brewreports having had telepathic experiences. Many such reports also appear in theanthropological literature. … Similarly many of my informants said that withoutovert verbal articulation they could pass messages to other people present inthe Ayahuasca session. … Likewise, many indicated that they received suchmessages from other persons or beings. Usually, in visions in which drinkersfeel that they are receiving messages or instructions from beings and creatures,the communication in question is said to be achieved without words—directly fromthought to thought.10 [part0051.html#note1362]In the modern world we are so fixated on our machines and devices that it’salmost impossible to imagine life without them. But if telepathy is real—adebate we won’t be able to get into here—and if its use and projection could berefined and made reliable, then who would need cell phones or Facebook or any ofthe other means of communication that are so ubiquitous today? Once again wewould own our own conversations rather than having to depend on someintermediary or “platform” to relay them!Might it not be the case that psi powers have always been part of the humanheritage? Part of our “Golden Age”? Perhaps these powers atrophied after theYounger Dryas cataclysm broke our connection to our roots? And perhaps, in theaftermath of the cataclysm, the resourcefulness of our species was refocused ontechniques of leverage and mechanical advantage and a negative feedback loopdeveloped that ushered in the march of the machines and saw psi banished to themargins of human experience?REVERSE ENGINEERING THE SYSTEMI’LL NOT SPECULATE FURTHER HERE about the lost technology of a destroyedcivilization. There are tantalizing hints and clues but unfortunately even thefirst archaeological steps that might make solid progress possible have neverbeen taken. There’s more to work with, however, when we come to religious andspiritual beliefs that, according to the Edfu Building Texts, it was the duty ofthe survivors of the lost civilization to preserve and to replicate wherever inthe world they could find receptive ground.In the twenty-first century, Christianity and Islam—upstart religions of thepast 2,000 years—exercise effective monopolies over the spiritual lives of morethan half the world’s population. Their simple formula of one creator god (male,of course), and of a heavenly paradise for His faithful paired with a hellishplace of punishment for disbelievers and evildoers, brilliantly removes the needfor serious thought. All that’s required to join the elect is to tick the rightboxes and maintain a state of rigid, abiding, unquestioning BELIEF in theauthority of the sacred texts and the utterances of the priests and the mullahsself-appointed to interpret them.Perhaps it’s the easiest option, requiring the smallest quantum of uncomfortablereflection, but it’s certainly not the only one, and neither is atheism—whichalso rests on unproven beliefs—in any way its opposite. The full range of humanspiritual potential cannot be brutally reduced to believing that a god exists orto believing that a god does not exist. Agnosticism is often proposed as theonly alternative, but there are far more subtle and even “scientific” waysforward, explored confidently by our ancestors many millennia ago, that deserveserious attention. Important elements survive in some of the more esotericaspects of Hinduism and Tibetan Buddhism—notably in The Tibetan Book of theDead, which bears striking similarities to the Ancient Egyptian Book of the Deadand descends, I suggest, from the same common source. There is much among theMaya (reported in Fingerprints of the Gods and in Heaven’s Mirror) that adds tothe picture. Meanwhile, Amazonian shamanism and the strangely interlinkedreligions of the Nile and Mississippi Valleys open further vistas ofunderstanding.In particular, whether we speak of the visionary “leap” to the Milky Way and tothe Underworld that lies beyond it made by Tukano shamans under the influence ofayahuasca, or of Mississippian ideas concerning the “Path of Souls,” or of theancient Egyptian afterlife journey through the Duat, I think the only reasonableconclusion to be drawn from the material presented in previous chapters is thatwe are dealing with a complex and sophisticated system of shared ideas inheritedfrom a remote common ancestor. And just as our DNA can be “reverse engineered”by geneticists to reveal much about our forebears, so, too, the shared segmentsof cultural DNA in the religions of the Mississippi Valley and ancient Egyptgive us insights into the character of the vastly more ancient predecessorreligion that spawned them both. That ancient religion—the religion of the lostcivilization—was itself, I would contend, a highly specialized offshoot ofNative American shamanism and its primary focus, as is the focus of allshamanism, was the mystery of death.WHAT HAPPENS TO US WHEN WE DIE?OUR SOCIETY PREFERS TO IGNORE and marginalize the problem of death. It is anever-present reality for all of us—much less when we are young, much more as wegrow old—and yet we do all we can to avoid it. We know in an abstract sense thatit awaits us, but meanwhile we prefer to dwell as little as possible on itsimplications and to live our lives as though they will never end.The reference frame out of which such thinking emerges cannot be pinned on anyof the Abrahamic religions but belongs to the scientism of the modern age, whichholds that we are entirely material creatures, random accidents of chemistry andbiology, that there is no transcendent meaning or purpose to our existence, thatthere is no such thing as the soul, that death is final, and that there is no“afterlife.” If those are your beliefs, which are only a subset of wider beliefsthat strip the universe of spirit and conceive of it as some sort of gigantic,unconscious automaton, then of course it makes sense to abjure all thoughts ofdeath and to postpone death for as long as possible, even though many ancienttraditions, despised by the scientific mind-set, warn that unwillingness to dieproduces unfavorable results. “As here in America,” comments W. Y. Evans-Wentz,the translator of The Tibetan Book of the Dead,every effort is apt to be made by a materialistically inclined medical scienceto postpone, and thereby to interfere with, the death-process. Very often thedying is not permitted to die in his or her own home or in a normal, unperturbedmental condition when the hospital has been reached. To die in hospital,probably while under the mind-benumbing influence of some opiate, or else underthe stimulation of some drug injected into the body to enable the dying to clingto life as long as possible, cannot but be productive of a very undesirabledeath, as undesirable as that of a shell-shocked soldier on a battlefield. Evenas the normal result of the birth-process may be aborted by malpractices, so,similarly, may the normal result of the death-process be aborted.11[part0051.html#note1363]Matters would have been handled very differently, I propose, in an advancedNative American civilization that had not severed its roots with shamanism—as wehave done—but had instead evolved forms of science and technology that emergeddirectly from shamanistic preoccupations and shamanistic experiences. Ratherthan turning its back on death, I expect that such a civilization would haveconfronted and investigated every aspect of the mystery, and would certainlyhave deployed trance techniques with scientific objectivity and discipline toexplore and test the reality status of the “Otherworlds” and “Underworlds”encountered in vision.It is further evidence of a remote common source behind some widespreadreligious motifs that one of the most famous myths of the ancient Greeks—thetale of Orpheus and Eurydice—was also present, long before European contact, inthe ancient pre-Columbian cultures of North America.12 [part0051.html#note1364]Some details vary, as of course do the names of the central characters and thegeneral setting, but the underlying structure remains the same13[part0051.html#note1365]—(1) a wife or sweetheart (Eurydice) dies prematurely;(2) her husband or lover (Orpheus) follows her soul to the Underworld andpersuades its ruler to let her return with him to the land of the living; (3)Eurydice’s release is agreed on condition that she walk behind Orpheus as theymake the return journey from the Underworld and that under no circumstancesshould he set eyes on her until they reach the land of the living; (4) at thelast moment, overcome with love, Orpheus cannot resist glancing over hisshoulder at his wife and in that instant she is cast back into the Underworldthat she can henceforth never leave.So compellingly similar are the Native American and Greek versions that leadingscholar of religions Ake Hultkrantz dedicated an immense monograph to themystery, published in Stockholm in 1957, titled The North American IndianOrpheus Tradition.14 [part0051.html#note1366] Meanwhile his contemporary,Canadian ethnographer Charles Marius Barbeau, proposed that the Greek and NativeAmerican stories must both be offshoots of some much older core narrative andconcluded, “The worldwide diffusion from an unknown source of a tale sotypically classical as Orpheus and Eurydice must have required millenniums.”15[part0051.html#note1367]Of course I agree that the wide distribution of localized versions of theOrpheus and Eurydice myth suggests the great antiquity of the common source fromwhich they all descend. But what I find equally interesting is that thefoundations of the narrative clearly lie in the concepts of the afterlifejourney of the soul and the duality of spirit and matter so central to thereligious beliefs of ancient Egypt and the ancient Mississippi Valley. Could itbe that what we have in these superficially separate but deeply interconnectedsystems are the surviving threads from a once immense tapestry of thought aboutthe human condition, our place in the cosmos, and the meaning of life and death?And just as our own sciences today are capable of highly sophisticatedinterventions and manipulations in the realm of matter, might it not be that thesciences of the lost civilization were capable of equally effectiveinterventions and manipulations in the realm of spirit—and possibly, therefore,had accumulated veridical information concerning dimensions of reality aboutwhich we ourselves are presently entirely ignorant?For those who believe that all notions of “spirit” are fantasy, thatconsciousness expires with the physical body, and that any form of life afterdeath is therefore impossible, the notion of investing time, resources, andingenuity in developing a “science of death”—perhaps better termed a “science ofthe afterlife” or even a “science of immortality”—sounds like the worst kind ofwishful thinking. The consequence, described so eloquently by W. Y. Evans-Wentz,is that from the materialistic perspective the only valid application of scienceto the problem of death is in the outfitting of hospitals and the preparation ofmedicines to “ease” the passing and—if the deceased is otherwise in goodphysical condition—to recycle his or her organs.But what if our materialist science, which has a pedigree of only a few hundredyears since the dawn of the so-called Age of Reason in the late seventeenthcentury, is fundamentally incomplete in its analysis of the nature of realityand of the phenomenon of death? And what if the far older tradition of theafterlife journey of the soul manifested in ancient Egypt and in the ancientMississippi Valley, and by Amazonian shamans to this day, conceals deep truths?If that were the case, then Western scientific materialism might have led usdown a very dark and dangerous path indeed—one with repercussions acrosseternity.In Tibetan Buddhism the afterlife realm is known as the Bardo—literally “theBetween.” Just like the Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead and the Mississippianoral and iconographic traditions, the purpose of the Tibetan Book of the Dead isto serve as a guidebook and instruction manual for the soul on its postmortemjourney through this strange parallel dimension.“The Between,” explains prominent American Buddhist scholar Robert A. F.Thurman, is “a time of crisis after death when the soul (the very subtlemind-body) is in its most highly fluid state.”16 [part0051.html#note1368] It isa time of extraordinary danger but also of extraordinary opportunity:If the good person, who has a strong momentum of good evolutionary action, isunprepared for the Between, he or she can lose an enormous amount ofevolutionary progress in the twinkling of an eye by becoming frightened andhiding in darkness. Similarly, a bad person, who has a great weight of negativeevolution, if well prepared for the Between, can overcome immense eons ofwretched lives by bravely shooting for the light. After all, a tiny achievementon the subtle plane can have a powerful impact on the gross. The soul in theBetween can directly modify, just with creative imagination, what the Buddhistscall “the spiritual genes” it carries with it. The Between voyager hastemporarily an immensely heightened intelligence, extraordinary powers ofconcentration, special abilities of clairvoyance and teleportation, flexibilityto become whatever can be imagined and the openness to be radically transformedby a thought or a vision or an instruction. This is indeed why the Betweentraveler can become instantly liberated just by understanding where he or she isin the Between, what the reality is, where the allies are, and where thedangers.17 [part0051.html#note1369]Western science possesses unprecedented knowledge of the material realm overwhich it has achieved extensive mastery. We should not assume, however, thatthis means it is also automatically in possession of superior knowledge thatrefutes the Tibetan “Science of Death” (the phrase that Robert Thurman uses todescribe the teachings in The Tibetan Book of the Dead18[part0051.html#note1370]). On the contrary, since Western science has shunnedinvestigation of the afterlife because of the unevidenced preconception thatthere is no such thing, we should rather accept that Tibetan Buddhism, which hasdevoted long centuries of intelligent study to the matter, may be far ahead ofus. Moreover, as I’ve argued, The Tibetan Book of the Dead descends from thesame vastly older progenitor that also gave rise to the ancient Egyptian andMississippian systems and therefore might potentially be harnessed, like them,to the task of reconstructing that progenitor.My sense is that the lost civilization, as might be expected with its proposedshamanic origins, was not much interested in material things. Like many otherNative American cultures, its primary goals were not to do with the acquisitionof status or wealth but instead were focused, through vision quests and rightliving, on the perfection of the soul. From the complexity and deep wisdom thatstill shines through in its offspring religions, I suggest that it took theseinquiries very far into regions of mystery that in our culture even quantumphysicists and scientists engaged with virtual reality have barely begun tocontemplate. In order to prepare its initiates thoroughly so that they might be“well equipped” for the ultimate journey of death—surely a matter of far greatersignificance than any material concerns—the direct exploration of paralleldimensions would, as noted earlier, almost certainly have been undertaken. Hadthis investigation been allowed to proceed uninterrupted it might by now havetranscended space, time, and matter entirely, but 12,800 years ago a deadly massof matter in the form of the Younger Dryas comet was flung at it and brought apause to the great prehistoric quest.A pause but not a halt—for if I’m right there were survivors who attempted, withvarying degrees of success, to repromulgate the lost teachings, planting“sleeper cells” far and wide in hunter-gatherer cultures in the form ofinstitutions and memes that could store and transmit knowledge and, when thetime was right, activate a program of public works, rapid agriculturaldevelopment, and enhanced spiritual inquiry.As to the fate of the lost civilization itself, I can only guess that its NorthAmerican homeland, in which it may have evolved in comparative isolation formore than 100,000 years, was located in one or several of the immense areassouth of the ice cap, from the Channeled Scablands of Washington State in thewest, through Nebraska, Wyoming, and the Dakotas, through the Great Lakes whereone of most devastating impacts may have occurred, and east to the Finger Lakesof upstate New York. I’ve suggested that this was a seafaring civilization, ableto map the Ice Age world and spread its influence to remote shores, but if ithad harbors on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America 13,000 yearsago, they would have been submerged by the rapid rise in sea levels at the onsetof the Younger Dryas 12,800 years ago and by the even more massive rise thatmarked the end of the Younger Dryas 11,600 years ago when the remnant ice capsof North America and Europe simultaneously collapsed into the oceans.PAST IMPERFECT, FUTURE UNCERTAINTHERE ARE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF myths from every inhabited continent that speakof the existence of an advanced civilization in remote prehistory, of the lostgolden age in which it flourished, and of the cataclysm that brought it to anend. A feature shared by many of them—the story of Atlantis, for example, or ofNoah’s flood—is the notion that human beings, by their own arrogance, cruelty,and disrespect for the earth, had somehow brought the disaster down upon theirown heads and accordingly were obliged by the gods to go back to basics andlearn humility again.Where does this sense of ancestral guilt come from with its peculiar intimationsof a mistaken direction taken by humanity in some remote period and purged by aglobal catastrophe? These are not the kinds of thoughts one would expecthunter-gatherers to devote much time to. A technologically advanced people, onthe other hand, particularly if they had mastered the transmutation of matter,would have had vastly more potential for hubris and overreach. In the event ofthe cataclysmic downfall of their civilization, those who survived might wellhave reflected on their history and blamed themselves for what happened.Who knows? Perhaps some hubristic excesses had occurred that would havejustified such speculations?A drift toward self-indulgent materialism?The introduction of human sacrifice?The appearance of a new and vigorously proselytizing cult denying the existenceof the soul?The enslavement and exploitation of hunter-gatherer tribes?The arming of one group of hunter-gatherers—such as Clovis—to give it acompetitive advantage over others?There could be 1,000 reasons why the humbled survivors of a once powerful butnow utterly destroyed civilization seeking refuge among hunter-gatherers mighthave arrived with a sense of guilt.An Ojibwa tradition seems relevant. It speaks of a comet that “burned up theearth” in the remote past and that is destined to return:The star with the long, wide tail is going to destroy the world some day when itcomes low again. That’s the comet called Long-Tailed Heavenly Climbing Star. Itcame down here once, thousands of years ago. Just like the sun. It had radiationand burning heat in its tail …Indian people were here before that happened, living on the earth. But thingswere wrong with nature on the earth, a lot of people had abandoned the spiritualpath. The Holy Spirit warned them a long time before the comet came. Medicinemen told everyone to prepare. … The comet burnt everything to the ground. Therewasn’t a thing left …There is a prophecy that the comet will destroy the earth again. But it’s arestoration. The greatest blessing this island [Turtle Island] will ever have.People don’t listen to their spiritual guidance today. There will be signs inthe sun, moon and stars when that comet comes down again.19[part0051.html#note1371]Our science and technology in the twenty-first century are close to the pointwhere, should we choose to do so and be willing to divert the necessaryresources from—say—military expenditures, it would be within our capacity tosweep our cosmic environment clean of asteroids and cometary debris and thusspare future generations the existential threat of further impacts. What is notwithin our scientific and technological competence, however, is to restore theearth and its environment after a major impact has occurred. Astronomer WilliamNapier, professor of astrobiology at the University of Cardiff and a worldexpert on comets and asteroids, reminds us that the consequences of a globalcelestial catastrophe would far outstrip our capacity to respond:A modest impact has the potential to end civilisation, a giant one might put ourspecies into an irreversible decline, like other primate species past andpresent. It took over three billion years of evolution to produce the soleterrestrial species capable of understanding the universe, and we do not knowwhether, if we are removed, intelligence is likely to evolve again. Nor do weknow whether there are other intelligent species in our Galaxy. In the eventthat we are alone, and are removed by some catastrophe, then our Galaxy willreturn to its former dumb state and may never again leave it. In that sense, thesurvival of this particular species of ape is a cosmic imperative.20[part0051.html#note1372]We have already received fair warning from the universe in the form of thecataclysmic earth changes at the onset of the Younger Dryas. No seriousresearcher disputes that those earth changes occurred and, since 2007, theYounger Dryas Impact Hypothesis has established itself as the most widelyaccepted explanation for everything that happened. But at first the earthscientists behind the hypothesis could only say that the evidence pointed to acosmic impactor of some kind, most likely a swarm of fragments from adisintegrating comet.In 2010, however, in a paper published in the Monthly Notices of the RoyalAstronomical Society, William Napier added his weight and specific details tothe conclusion that a comet had indeed been involved—a giant comet, perhaps 100kilometers in diameter, according to his calculations, that entered the innersolar system on an earth-crossing orbit somewhere between 30,000 and 20,000years ago and thereafter underwent the series of fragmentations that spawned theTaurid meteor stream.21 [part0051.html#note1373] This is a normal process forcomets22 [part0051.html#note1374] and it’s Professor Napier’s case thatintersection with the fragmenting debris of this exceptionally large cometaround 12,800 years ago “provides a satisfactory explanation” for the postulatedcelestial origin of the Younger Dryas cataclysm.23 [part0051.html#note1375]It’s my case that the hit humanity took then erased a remarkable civilizationfrom the record and that we have remained mired in amnesia ever since. In theprocess what is being neglected, despite the increasingly urgent warnings of ahandful of astronomers, is that most of the rubble from the ongoingfragmentation of the original comet remains in orbit in the Taurid meteorstream, including some pieces of enormous size capable of ending civilizationagain. Indeed, as we saw in chapter 25, it’s Napier’s conclusion that this“unique complex of debris” represents “the greatest collision hazard facing theearth at the present time.”24 [part0051.html#note1376]In September 2017, drawing on imagery captured by the European Fireball Network,important new research on the Taurids, published in the journal Astronomy andAstrophysics, gave strong support to Napier’s warning. The title of the paperspeaks for itself: “Discovery of a New Branch of the Taurid Meteoroid Stream asa Real Source of Potentially Hazardous Bodies.”25 [part0051.html#note1377]The newly discovered branch is part of the Southern Taurids, encountered by theearth in late October and the first half of November, and it is just one of manyindications that humanity’s relationship with the Younger Dryas comet is notover. On the contrary, all the evidence from the close observation andinvestigation of the Taurids now being undertaken by astronomers is that we maybe about to enter—or indeed may already have entered—an episode of enhanceddanger. Ahead of us, perhaps still some decades away, lie particularly dense andturbulent filaments of the stream believed to contain “dark” fragments of theoriginal comet, in one case with a possible world-killing diameter of 30kilometers.26 [part0051.html#note1378]A TIME FOR CHANGE?THIS BOOK HAS ROOTS IN much of my earlier work, particularly on ancient Mexico,the ancient Andean civilizations of South America, and ancient Egypt. However,it was not until early December 2016, during a visit I made to North Dakota andto the protest camp named Oceti Sakowin situated just beyond the presentnorthern boundary of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, that America Beforecrystallized in my mind as a definite concept, coupled with firm intent.Readers may recall how, from July 2016 onward, a rainbow coalition of Sioux,other Native American tribes, and non–Native American people gathered at OcetiSakowin in an attempt to stop the laying of an oil pipeline under Lake Oahe onthe Missouri River half a mile north of Standing Rock in a location where it notonly transgressed traditionally sacred lands, but also threatened thereservation’s water supply in the event of a spill.Although extremely active and impassioned in the face of a clampdown bymilitarized security police, the protests of those who had become known as the“water protectors” failed to achieve their immediate objective, which was tohave construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) halted completely. Quiteto the contrary, on February 7, 2017, the official easement was granted,27[part0051.html#note1379] work to complete the DAPL went ahead, and the first oilbegan to flow on June 1, 2017.28 [part0051.html#note1380] There were legalchallenges from the Sioux and further protests and controversy following oilspills.29 [part0051.html#note1381] In December 2017 some interim restrictionswere imposed on the pipeline operator to prevent further spills,30[part0051.html#note1382] but as I write these words in July 2018, oil is stillflowing through the pipeline and it seems that commercial interests have onceagain effectively trumped the interests and concerns of Native Americans.31[part0051.html#note1383]Central to the entire protest at Standing Rock was the notion that we live at atime when there is an urgent need to change our ways, to adopt a more humble andno longer rapacious approach to the earth, and to receive a spiritual messagepassed down from the ancients and held in safekeeping by the First Americans.It’s a message that resonates profoundly for me with so much that I’ve learnedwhile researching this book.“This is about everyone,” Cody Two Bears of the Standing Rock Sioux told me ashe explained the larger purpose of the Oceti Sakowin protests:It’s such an important time today—why people need to know this history. Because,for one, the history books would never tell you the correct story … the reasonwhy. I talk to a lot of elders and a lot of spiritual leaders. We had to keepour ceremonies secret. We had to keep our stories a secret for so many years topreserve that. Because the government was fearful of what we had and who we areas a people. The laws will tell you that. There’s even a current standing lawtoday in Montana, I don’t think they’ve taken it out of their law book, that ifyou see three Native Americans all together then you are able to shoot and killthem. Still legal in Montana! Those are the types of laws they created becausethey don’t want to see Native Americans gather because for some reason they werefearful of us.But little do they know, our ceremonies and our ways of life protected us andUnci Maka [Mother Earth]. We prayed even for those people who were afraid of us,to help them … to pray for them to make sure they were okay.That’s what our ceremonies are based around. It’s not witchcraft … it’s notcasting spells on anybody, but that’s what they thought for many, many years. …For example, the Ghost Dances we used to have in Lakota and Dakota country. Whenwe did that, the Washi’chu [white people—literally “those who always take thelargest portion”] were so fearful. They thought we were casting spells, when allin all we were trying to keep the balance with the Earth and the Stars. We needto keep that in balance, because if we don’t start doing that today, we’re notgoing to have anywhere to live in the next hundred years.”Some 12,800 years ago the balance between the Earth and the Stars was lost and akey chapter of the human story was lost with it. If it happens again, if ourbrief chapter, too, is lost, will all that remains of us at some vast remove inthe future be an unhappy myth that tells of how, through our own greed andconceit, through our own recklessness and disregard for the planet in our care,and through our own excess of hate and dearth of love, we conspired in our owndownfall?"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 1MELAZONIA, AKA AMANESIAAlthough they are “a world apart and separated by forty thousand years or moreof human history,” certain “striking resemblances” and “remarkable similaritiesbetween societies in Amazonia and Melanesia” have kept scholars puzzled for morethan a century.1 [part0051.html#note1384]One of these puzzles concerns the skull shapes of indigenous Amazonians andMelanesians and an always unorthodox theory known as the “Paleoamericanhypothesis”2 [part0051.html#note1385] that proposes, “on the basis of cranialmorphology” (just a fancy name for skull shapes):that two temporally and source-distinct populations colonized the Americas. Theearlier population reportedly originated in Asia in the Late Pleistocene andgave rise to both Paleoamericans and present-day Australo-Melanesians, whoseshared cranial morphological attributes are presumed to indicate their commonancestry. The Paleoamericans were, in turn, thought to have been largelyreplaced by ancestors of present-day Amerindians, whose crania resemble modernEast Asians and who are argued to be descendants of later arriving Mongoloidpopulations. The presence of Paleoamericans is inferred primarily from ancientarchaeological specimens in North and South America and a few relict populationsof more recent age, which include the extinct Pericúes and Fuego-Patagonians.The Paleoamerican hypothesis predicts that these groups should be geneticallycloser to Australo-Melanesians than other Amerindians.3 [part0051.html#note1386]Maanasa Raghavan and Eske Willerslev, both of the Centre for Geo-Genetics at theUniversity of Copenhagen, put the hypothesis to the test at the genetic level aspart of their study (discussed in part 3) and found that the ancient and morerecent Native American skulls previously identified as havingAustralo-Melanesian morphology in fact cluster at the genetic level “with otherNative American groups” and show no affinity to Australo-Melanesians.4[part0051.html#note1387]Their data joined a mass of preexisting genetic evidence pointing to the sameconclusion.For example, another study found that even the most ancient skulls displaying“traits attributable to Paleoamerican crania” turned out, after geneticsequencing, to “present the same mtDNA haplogroups as later populations withAmerindian morphology.”5 [part0051.html#note1388]A third comparative study of morphometric and molecular mtDNA haplogroup datafrom ancient and more recent Native American skeletal remains likewise concludedthat “human populations inhabiting the Americas during archaic times cannot beconsidered as belonging to two different groups on the basis of analyzed data.”6[part0051.html#note1389]In other words, although their skulls indeed might appear different, and muchmore like Australo-Melanesian skulls than more recent Amerindian skulls,“Paleoamericans” turn out to be genetically indistinct from more recentAmerindian populations. Since genotype trumps phenotype every time as evidencefor relatedness, the “Paleoamerican hypothesis” has therefore been regarded forsome years as disproved.Following their own study, however, discussed in chapter 9, Pontus Skoglund andDavid Reich (both of the Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School) seemopen to reconsidering the whole question when they describe their hypothetical“Population Y” that “likely contributed to the DNA of Native Americans fromAmazonia and the Central Brazilian Plateau” as “a lineage more closely relatedto present-day Australasians than to present-day East Asians and Siberians.”7[part0051.html#note1390] They go on to add:This discovery is striking in light of interpretations of the morphology of someearly Native American skeletons, which some authors have suggested haveaffinities to Australasian groups. The largest number of skeletons that havebeen described as having this craniofacial morphology and that date to youngerthan 10,000 years old have been found in Brazil, the home of the Surui,Karitiana and Xavante groups who show the strongest affinity to Australasians ingenetic data.8 [part0051.html#note1391]What has never been substantially in dispute is that the craniometricsimilarities between ancient populations from the Brazilian Amazon andAustralo-Melanesian populations are real and quantifiable.9[part0051.html#note1392] Moreover, while equally real and quantifiable, thegenetic data suggesting that these similarities are not evidence of relatednessbut must be coincidental, or perhaps the result of some sort of bizarre parallelevolutionary process, seems to me—and clearly to Skoglund and Reich as well—tobe directly contradicted by that Australo-Melanesian signal sending out itsrather compelling message of relatedness from Brazil.In view of this I’d say, at the very least, that the earlier craniometric dataneeds to be revisited, particularly a study by Walter A. Neves and Mark Hubbepublished in December 2005 in the Proceedings of the National Academy ofSciences in which “the largest sample of early American skulls everstudied”—eighty-one skulls from Brazil’s Lagoa Santa region—is compared “withworldwide datasets representing global morphological variation in humans,through three different multivariate analyses.”10 [part0051.html#note1393]In their paper Neves and Hubbe point out:Whereas late prehistoric, recent, and present Native Americans tend to exhibit acranial morphology similar to late and modern Northern Asians … the earliestSouth Americans tend to be more similar to present Australians, Melanesians, andSub-Saharan Africans.11 [part0051.html#note1394]After conducting detailed measurements and analyses of their collection ofeighty-one ancient Brazilian skulls and running their global comparisons, Nevesand Hubbe are confident that “the results obtained from all multivariateanalyses confirm a close morphological affinity between South-AmericanPaleoindians and extant Australo-Melanesian groups.”12 [part0051.html#note1395]They then go on to offer two different hypotheses to explain “the morphologicaldifferences observed between early and late Native South Americans:”One is a local microevolutionary process that transformed, in situ, thePaleoamerican morphology into that prevailing today among Native Americans. Theother is that the Americas were successively occupied by two morphologicallydifferentiated human stocks, with the Paleoamerican morphology entering first.We believe the second hypothesis is more plausible for three reasons: first, itwould be very unlikely that the same evolutionary event … happened in theAmericas and in East Asia in parallel at approximately the same time; second,because in South America, at least, the transition between the two morphologicalpatterns was, as far as we know, abrupt; and third, cranial morphology hasrecently been shown to respond adaptively only to extreme environmentalconditions, being therefore much less plastic than originally thought.13[part0051.html#note1396]In short, as Neves and Hubbe summarize elsewhere in their paper, their resultssupport the hypothesis “that two distinct biological populations could havecolonized the New World in the Pleistocene-Holocene transition.”14[part0051.html#note1397]This, of course, is a conclusion arrived at from the craniometric data, but itis also precisely the conclusion arrived at by Skoglund and Reich from theirreading of the genetic data; namely, as the title of their 2015 Nature paperindicates, that there is “genetic evidence for two founding populations of theAmericas.”15 [part0051.html#note1398]On the other hand, as we’ve seen, Raghavan and Willerslev disagree. In theirScience paper they favor, instead, a single founding population.16[part0051.html#note1399]Clearly in a state of affairs like this where the experts come to radicallydifferent conclusions based on nuances within essentially the same data, itwould be unwise to go with one side or the other. Whether in the form of skullsor genes, though, it seems to me that the clues so far point in the directionof—to say the least!—some sort of forgotten connection.There’s more.TWO TOWERS OF BABELSeveral researchers have noted that Australo-Melanesia and the Americas bothmanifest extraordinary “linguistic diversity” featuring much greater numbers oflanguages than in all other parts of the world. An implication of this, arguesanthropologist German Dziebel, is that:measured by the number of independent linguistic stocks, linguistic divergencein the Americas must have taken at least 35,000 years. Of course, this figurecannot be taken literally but there’s a marked contrast between languagediversity in the Americas (and in places like Papua New Guinea, with humanarchaeological record of some 40,000 years) and language diversity in Africa.17[part0051.html#note1400]Austin Whittall, an author and regular blogger on ancient South Americangenetics and anthropological issues, also comments on the surprising phenomenonof high levels of linguistic diversity in Australo-Melanesia and the Americas:Why do Native American people speak so many languages? They supposedly reachedthe New World recently … yet evolved over 40% of the global languages! A figurehigher than that found in Africa, the “Cradle of Mankind.”Africans have had the time … and the advantage of not going through bottlenecks.… so they should have evolved more languages than any other group of humans. Butthey have not.18 [part0051.html#note1401]New Guinea, Whittall points out next, has “the highest language diversity in thewhole world.”19 [part0051.html#note1402] Indeed, authority on world languagesEthnologue confirms that there are 841 living languages in Papua New Guinea,which make up 11.85 percent of living languages in the world.20[part0051.html#note1403]Whittal finds this quite reasonable:the island is a jungle, with many mountain ranges that isolate populations andkeep them from mixing. New Guinea has been considered as one of the first placesreached by mankind during our epic trek out of Africa.But America is different. … The Papuans had 50 ky to develop their languages,the Amerindians had less than 15 ky. So how do we explain this?21[part0051.html#note1404]The linguistic diversity of the Americas is an anomaly—Whittall is absolutelyright about this—and its parallels with the linguistic diversity of New Guineaand Australasia in general are intriguing. The following table,22[part0051.html#note1405] reproduced in Whittall’s blog, makes the anomaly clear:Total numbers of separate language families by macrocontinent AFRICA & EURASIA87 (25%) AUSTRALASIA 110 (32%) AMERICAS 144 (42%)Source: The Autotyp database (Bickel and Nichols 2002ff; Nichols et al. 2013)“I do believe,” Whittall concludes, “that we should look into language diversityas an indicator of an older origin for mankind as a whole and for an earlierdate for the peopling of America.”23 [part0051.html#note1406]It’s an excellent point but, for me, the more immediate takeaway is the twoclusters of especially abundant linguistic diversity that the table highlights,one in Australasia and the other in the Americas. Moreover, we’ve already seenthat within Australasia it’s Melanesian New Guinea that has by far the highestlevel of linguistic diversity—indeed higher than anywhere else in the world.Likewise, within the Americas, South America has more than double the linguisticdiversity of North America,24 [part0051.html#note1407] with the greatestabundance of all found in lowland Amazonia where no fewer than 350 of SouthAmerica’s total of 448 languages are spoken.25 [part0051.html#note1408]Number of language families Number of languages Average number of languages perfamily NORTH AMERICA 13 220 16.9 CENTRAL AMERICA 6 273 45.4 SOUTH AMERICA 37 44812.1Once again, therefore, Melanesian New Guinea and Amazonia seem to parallel oneanother. Each has the highest level of linguistic diversity within its ownmacrocontinent and together they occupy first and second place among the world’smost linguistically diverse regions.26 [part0051.html#note1409]NOW SOME WEIRD STUFF …Melanesia and Amazonia are divided by the full width of the Pacific Ocean, soethnographers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries wereperplexed when they found that certain distinctive customs and patterns ofbehavior occurred in almost exactly the same forms in both places.For example, the practice of organizing society around so-called men’s houses,where:the men conducted secret rituals of initiation and procreation, excluded thewomen, and punished those who would violate the cult with gang rape or death. Inboth regions, the men told similar myths that explained the origin of the cultsand gender separation. The resemblances were such as to convince anthropologistsof the day, including Robert Lowie, Heinrich Shurtz, and Hutton Webster, thatthey could only have come about through diffusion. Lowie flatly declared thatmen’s cults are “an ethnographic feature originating in a single center, andthence transmitted to other regions.”The parallels included not only men’s cults but also similar systems ofecological adjustment; egalitarian social organization; flexibility in local-and descent-group composition and recruitment; endemic warfare; similarreligious, mythological and cosmological systems; and similar beliefs relatingto the body, procreation and the self. 27 [part0051.html#note1410]The scholarly puzzlement at these sorts of similarities has continued into thetwenty-first century, for example, in a detailed study, “Gender in Amazonia andMelanesia,” published by the University of California Press in 2001,28[part0051.html#note1411] which followed an international symposium organized bythe Wenner-Gren Foundation. The symposium was “inspired by the suggestion oftenmade by anthropologists that the cultures of Amazonia and Melanesia seem todisplay startling resemblances even though they are historically,linguistically, and geographically unrelated.”29 [part0051.html#note1412]I do not wish to overload the reader with detail from this important in-depthstudy, but a few examples will give the general flavor of the results.The Mundurukú of the Brazilian Amazon and the Avatik of the Sepik River innorthern Papua New Guinea both, traditionally, visited “random, indiscriminateviolence” on outsiders “as an internal requirement of the village’s male cult.”In both cases raids were seen as a special kind of hunting. In both cases cultmembers sought prestige in the eyes of fellow villagers by taking trophy headsduring their raids. In both cases the heads were not brought back to the villageuntil the men had undergone a ritual period of seclusion and sexual abstinence.And in both cases the heads were believed to enhance and renew fertility.30[part0051.html#note1413]Among the Sambia of eastern Papua New Guinea, as among the Arawete, Jivaro, andMehinaku of the Amazon, a war leader would traditionally exhibit his erect penisas a sign of his aggression.31 [part0051.html#note1414]Among the Alambak, the Sawos, and the Sepik Wape of Papua New Guinea, as amongthe Cashinahua of the Amazon, domestic conflict prior to a hunt or raid wasbelieved to bring “bad luck” to the endeavor.32 [part0051.html#note1415]In both Melanesia and Amazonia blood is seen as the main agent of growth andvitality. In both regions it is blood—especially menstrual blood—that is seen asthe mother’s contribution to conception or gestation. In both regions semen isconsidered closely related to blood or interactive with blood, and many believe,more specifically, that a fetus “is formed from the combination of female bloodand male semen.”33 [part0051.html#note1416]In both Melanesia and Amazonia “the central symbols of the men’s cults” arebullroarers, flutes, and trumpets, and in both regions the myths recall a timewhen “women discovered, invented, or possessed” these powerful cult objects. Inboth regions the myths say that the former control of these objects by womenallowed them to dominate men. In both regions the myths also say that the menjoined forces and compelled or deceived the women into handing the cult objectsover to them, resulting in a reordering of society and the dominance of men.Moreover, in both regions “the men share a strategic secret: the sounds of thetrumpets, flutes and other instruments associated with the cult are not thevoices of spirits but are produced by the men themselves.”34[part0051.html#note1417]Anthropologist Pascale Bonnemère draws attention to certain “strikingsimilarities” in initiation rituals as performed among the Angans of New Guineaand by tribes in the Vaupés region of the Colombian Amazon. These “involve theplaying of musical instruments that are hidden from women and that were owned bythem in mythic times; they imply the consumption of substances that aresymbolically associated with reproduction; they are interpreted in a similarway, as a rebirth of the young boys into the world of men; and myths offer keysfor understanding the ritual.”35 [part0051.html#note1418]In both Amazonia and Melanesia there are dire consequences for women, includingsubjection to gang rape and murder, if they see the cult instruments.36[part0051.html#note1419] There is also disruption to society as a whole. Amongthe Gimi of Papua New Guinea, for example, as among the Barasana of the Amazon,there is a belief that chaos and social disintegration will follow if the men’ssacred bamboo flutes are seen by women.37 [part0051.html#note1420] Nonetheless,in both Amazonia and Melanesia, the men do not hesitate to “parade and play” theinstruments “in public areas such as gardens and plazas that are normally opento women. As such, the men must be extraordinarily vigilant in sequestering thewomen during rituals”—which in practice, in both regions, means forcing them toremain indoors.38 [part0051.html#note1421]In summary, as Thomas A. Gregor and Donald Tuzin, editors of Gender in Amazoniaand Melanesia, conclude, “The similarities of men’s institutions in Amazonia andMelanesia is one of the great riddles of culture that has not received theattention that it deserves.”39 [part0051.html#note1422] In their view it isquite noteworthy enough that the “men’s house complex”40[part0051.html#note1423] obtains in both regions, but “what is even morestriking is that the details of the cult also bear close comparison.”41[part0051.html#note1424]They’re right about the magnitude of the riddle but, in my view, the solutionthey offer is singularly disappointing. Just like the quacks who each yearconjure a new mental illness from thin air to add to the already morbidly obeseDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, so, too, Gregor and Tuzinare convinced that the whole weird complex of behavior around men’s cults inMelanesia and Amazonia is best understood using the tools of psychoanalysis:We need the insights of psychology and especially that of personality dynamicsto explain the emotional content and the remarkable regularities in men’sconduct in such different cultures.42 [part0051.html#note1425]Though writing in 2001, they particularly recommend the approach taken in a 1959paper by Robert Murphy on the Mundurukú men’s cult:Murphy pointed out that the psychological roots of the cult draw on theuniversal emotional conflicts associated with the Oedipus complex. Thesimultaneous fear of women and antagonism toward them and the associated mythsof matriarchy are reflections of the dark side of the family romance. Since theOedipus complex is universal, Murphy wondered, “why are we not all swingingbullroarers?” His answer is that men’s cults appear to flourish in socialenvironments where the unity of groups of men and groups of women is not blurredby competing modes of role allocation such as derive from political hierarchy orkinship. The small horticultural societies of Amazonia and Melanesia fit thisdescription.43 [part0051.html#note1426]Do you see what’s being sold to us here? Wrapped up in the same package of ideasthat portrays the cults as the outcome of deep-rooted psychological complexes,we’re also being asked to accept that these complexes manifest in the samedistinctive ways in Melanesia and Amazonia because of the state of economicdevelopment of these societies.Both propositions are profoundly reductionist. The first seeks to reduce theremarkably similar details of male behavior in both regions to underlyingpsychiatric issues. The second seeks to reduce the cultural expression of suchissues to the specific socioeconomic circumstances of small horticulturalsocieties—as though flutes, trumpets, bullroarers, initiation ceremonies, ritualprohibitions, and gang rape and murder for those who break them can be expectedto appear, almost automatically, in such societies.There are other options, and the most obvious that immediately springs to mindis diffusion. Throughout human history, ideas, religions, cults, and ritualshave always traveled far. Why, therefore, should they not have done so inprehistory as well? As we’ve seen, Gregor and Tuzin do admit that at one timeleading anthropologists were convinced that diffusion of ideas “from a singlecenter” was the best explanation for the strange cultural similarities betweenMelanesia and Amazonia. Other than adding that subsequently “the diffusionistschool of anthropology waned,”44 [part0051.html#note1427] however, Gregor andTuzin barely give the notion a second thought. Their whole focus remainsthroughout on psychological and sociological explanations.Who knows? They could be right. They have certainly done a wonderful job ofassembling the comparative cultural data, and if I were assessing that data inisolation, if it were just the bizarre and idiosyncratic similarities that keepon cropping up, if that were all there were to it, then I might be impressed bytheir proposed sociological psychodrama.But that’s by no means all there is to it.First and foremost, there’s that totally unexpected Australo-Melanesian geneticsignal among Amazonian peoples, discovered in 2015, which Gregor and Tuzin couldnot have been aware of in 2001. The very fact that it’s there at all means thatdiffusion of some kind can no longer be ruled out.Second, there’s more than a hint of a connection from cranial morphology.Third, Australo-Melanesia and Amazonia constitute the world’s largest survivingreservoirs of linguistic diversity, suggesting that their languages haveextremely ancient roots.And now, fourth, we find complex and multilayered similarities in culturalinstitutions and beliefs in both these widely separated regions.It stretches credulity to put the simultaneous occurrence of all these factorsdown to coincidence.A more “parsimonious explanation,” I believe, is that something else must havebeen going on, some other process must have been under way behind the scenes,some other hand must have been at work, that hasn’t yet been accounted for."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 2ANCIENT MAPS OF THE ICE AGEThe Waldseemüller World Map of 1507 (next page) is notable for the apparentextreme inaccuracy with which sixteenth-century Southeast Asia and Australia arerepresented.By contrast the map offers a much closer match to the region as it appeared inthe depths of the Ice Age around 21,300 years ago, when Sahul and Sunda (modernSoutheast Asia and Australia) formed an almost continuous landmass.Waldseemüller’s and other similar maps of the sixteenth century were produced bycopying from older source maps while attempting to incorporate into theminformation from the voyages of discovery of Columbus and other later mariners.Deriving from the discarded and lost older source maps, the portrayal ofgeographical features last present during the Ice Age hints at the existence ofa lost civilization that was capable of exploring and mapping the earth inremotest prehistory.Image Missing [../images/00165.jpeg]ANTEDILUVIAN CARTOGRAPHY?It is the—at first surprising—hypothesis of Professor Robert Fuson of theUniversity of South Florida that the island named “Satanaze” on the 1424Pizzagano Chart, though incorrectly located in the Atlantic Ocean, is, arguably,the earliest-surviving representation of Japan in European cartography.Professor Fuson’s 1995 book Legendary Islands of the Ocean Sea,1[part0051.html#note1428] in which he makes this case with a mass ofcorroborative evidence, came to my attention while I was researching my own bookUnderworld, published in 2002.Image Missing [../images/00166.jpeg]The 1424 Pizzagano Chart incorrectly locates the islands of Japan and Taiwan(respectively nominated as Satanaze and Antilia) in the Atlantic Ocean.Santanaze is the northernmost of the two dark landmasses shown at mid-left onthe Chart.I’m convinced by Professor Fuson’s argument, but what I suggest is equallysignificant about it is a matter that Fuson himself does not comment on, leavingopen the opportunity for me to explore it at some length in Underworld—namelythat “Satanaze”/Japan is not depicted as the principal Japanese islands wouldhave looked in 1424, when details from older source maps were copied onto thePizzagano Chart, but rather as Japan would have appeared during the lowered sealevels of the last Ice Age, in a very specific interlude, between 13,500 and12,400 years ago, spanning the cataclysmic onset of the Younger Dryas.2[part0051.html#note1429]Image Missing [../images/00167.jpeg]During that interlude the three principal Japanese islands, Honshu, Kyushu, andShikoku, (above right) were all conjoined to form a single large island, asdepicted in the sea-level-rise map (above left), based on modern geologicalstudies.3 [part0051.html#note1430] The depiction of “Satanaze” on the PizzaganoChart (above center), also shows Honshu, Kyushu, and Shikoku as one island andaccurately depicts the inlets that existed between 13,500 and 12,400 years agosouthwest and northeast of what would later become the island of Shikoku.A similar state of affairs presents itself on the other side of the world in arepresentation of Ireland and its surrounding waters in the PtolemaeusArgentinae map of 1513 (below left). Below right is a bathymetric map of Irelandand the surrounding seas with a resolution of 2 minutes. Depth can be gaugedthrough the shading as well as by the contour line, which is placed at 55 metersbeneath today’s sea level. The bathymetry reveals that around 13,000 years ago,during the lowered sea levels of the Ice Age, a significant island, with an areaof perhaps 100 square kilometers, occupied the exact location where thesupposedly “legendary” island named “Brazil” appears on the PtolemaeusArgentinae map of 1513.4 [part0051.html#note1431]Image Missing [../images/00168.jpeg]The implication, again, is that some unknown civilization explored the earthduring the Ice Age and that copies of copies of scraps of the maps made by itsseafarers and navigators survived to be used as sources of reference bycartographers in the late Middle Ages.A clear line of transmission through the library of Alexandria viaConstantinople and thence into Europe during the era of the Crusades is tracedin Fingerprints of the Gods for those who wish to follow the matter further.5[part0051.html#note1432]THE HOLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WORLDAntarctica remained undiscovered by the seafarers and navigators of ourcivilization until the year 1819, and accordingly does not feature onearly-nineteenth-century maps, such as the Pinkerton map of 1818 (below left).To the right of it, for comparison, is a modern map of Antarctica.Image Missing [../images/00169.jpeg]Image Missing [../images/00170.jpeg]Curiously, although supposedly undiscovered at that time, Antarctica does appearon several maps from the sixteenth century, such as the Oronteus Finnaeus worldmap (top), and below it the Mercator world map, which in turn were copied fromolder source maps now lost.6 [part0051.html#note1433]Image Missing [../images/00171.jpeg]ISLAND OF MEGALITHSThe Piri Reis map of 1513 features the western shores of Africa and the easternshores of North and South America and is also controversially claimed to depictIce Age Antarctica—as an extension of the southern tip of South America. Ireport this claim in Fingerprints of the Gods.7 [part0051.html#note1434]The same map (above left and top right) depicts a large island lying east of thesoutheast coast of what is now the United States. Also clearly depicted runningalong the spine of this island is a “road” of huge megaliths. In this exact spotduring the lowered sea levels of the Ice Age a large island was indeed locateduntil approximately 12,400 years ago. A remnant survives today in the form ofthe islands of Andros and Bimini. Underwater off Bimini (above, lower right andbelow) I have scuba-dived on a road of great megaliths exactly like thosedepicted above water on the Piri Reis map.Image Missing [../images/00172.jpeg]Again, the implication, regardless of the separate controversy of whether theso-called Bimini Road is a man-made or natural feature, is that the region musthave been explored and mapped before the great floods at the end of the Ice Agecaused the sea level to rise and submerged the megaliths."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 3FIRST THERE WAS A FOREST, THEN THERE WAS NO FOREST, THEN THERE WAS …What sort of place was the Amazon during the Ice Age? What was its climate? Andwhat about the environment, vegetation, and trees?Given the enormous importance of the world’s largest surviving rainforest inglobal ecology today, I had assumed the subject would have been well studied andthat the experts would long ago have reached a consensus. In the case of theformer I was correct but in the case of the latter I was not—for there is anever-shifting consensus that, when you get right down to it, is pretty much thesame thing as no consensus at all.Here’s a brief timeline of the debate as I see it: 1. Prior to and into the 1990s, the scientific consensus supported the view that the Amazon had been largely arid during the Ice Age, with isolated rainforest “refugia” broken up by extensive areas of savanna and open vegetation. 2. From the mid-1990s onward, into the early years of the twenty-first century, this entire view came under attack and, out of the dispute, a new consensus emerged in which the Amazon had “always” (anyway for millions of years) been a rainforest, much as it is now. 3. Finally, in the past decade or so the consensus appears to have shifted again and we are told that actually, yes, much of the Amazon was savanna during the Ice Age, and that the tropical rainforest we see today has been present for at most 7,000 or 8,000 years—and barely 2,000 years in some areas.It’s instructive to spend a few moments sampling the flavor and character ofthis shifting consensus. Let’s start with a paper by P. A. Colinvaux, P. E. DeOliveira, and M. B. Bush, published in January 2000 in Quaternary ScienceReviews, that confirms the overthrow of the earlier, pre-1990s paradigm of anarid savanna interspersed with rainforest refugia:Our conclusion that the Amazon lowlands were forested in glacial timesspecifically refutes the hypothesis of Amazonian glacial aridity.1[part0051.html#note1435]A few months later, Katherine Willis and Robert Whittaker of Oxford Universitypublished similar conclusions in Science:The evidence clearly indicates that the lowland tropical forests were notextensively replaced by savanna vegetation during the glacial periods, butrather that the forests dominated throughout.2 [part0051.html#note1436]In the following year, 2001, a study published in Palaeogeography,Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology concluded:In the later Pleistocene the whole of the Amazon lowlands were underclosed-canopy forest throughout all stages of a glacial cycle, contrary to thebiogeographical consensus of the last thirty years.3 [part0051.html#note1437]A 2003 study published in the journal Geology reinforced this view:The current tropical rainforest vegetation has been a permanent and dominantfeature of the Amazon River watershed over the past 70 k.y. Specifically, wefound no evidence for the development of large savannas that had been previouslypostulated as indicators of increased glacial aridity in Amazonia.4[part0051.html#note1438]A further study, published in November 2004 in Palaeogeography,Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, investigated the Hill of Six Lakes in theNorthwest Brazilian Amazon and concluded:The data indicate the continuous presence of mesic forest throughout the lastice age. … Even during lowstand episodes, pollen is well preserved and providesa clear signal of uninterrupted forest cover.5 [part0051.html#note1439]But now let’s jump forward to 2013, when a follow-up study of the Hill of SixLakes, published in Quaternary Sciences Reviews, lamented the great length oftime that “Six Lakes was erroneously used as an emblematic locality toillustrate the permanence of the rainforest in the Amazon basin”6[part0051.html#note1440] because:all of the proxies seem to indicate that the present-day vegetation dates backto the middle-late Holocene, around 6 cal ka BP.7 [part0051.html#note1441]And a year later, in July 2014, a study in the Proceedings of the NationalAcademy of Sciences reduced the inception of the present-day forest cover ofsome parts of the Amazon to just 2,000 years ago or less. Focusing on southernAmazonia, the study concluded that:the inhabitants exploited a naturally open savanna landscape that theymaintained around their settlement despite the climatically driven rainforestexpansion that began ~2,000 years ago across the region.8[part0051.html#note1442]Last, in Quaternary Science Reviews of October 1, 2017, Professor Diana Fontesand Professor Renato Cordeiro published a study titled “PaleoenvironmentalDynamics in South Amazonia, Brazil, during the Last 35,000 Years Inferred fromPollen and Geochemical Records of Lago do Saci.” Their conclusion, although theystate that “the rainforest always existed in this region,” is that it underwent“expansion and regression” over time.9 [part0051.html#note1443]There are many other papers I could cite reflecting the shifting consensus, butI’m sure the reader has got my point by now. When leading scientific authoritiesare in such a state of disagreement that prevailing paradigms abruptly changeevery decade or two, we cannot be at all sure of the solidity and merits of thecurrent paradigm—according to which the Amazon rainforest in its present form isless than 8,000 years old, and in some areas less than 2,000 years old.Reviewing the literature, I felt that the conclusion of Fontes and Cordeiro,that there was always rainforest in the area they studied but that it wassubject to periodic expansions and contractions, might help to explain whyconsensus on this subject has been so elusive. The Amazon basin is, after all, avast and diverse region encompassing more than 7 million square kilometers, ofwhich approximately 5.5 million square kilometers are presently covered byrainforest.10 [part0051.html#note1444] The figures only become meaningful bycomparison. The whole of India, with a total area of 2.97 million km2, is lessthan half the size of the Amazon basin, but Australia, at 7.68 million km2 isbigger, as are China (9.38 million km2), Canada (9.09 million km2), the UnitedStates (9.15 million km2), and Europe (10.18 million km2).11[part0051.html#note1445] All in all, then, it’s fair to say that what the Amazonconfronts us with is a truly gigantic landmass, on a scale similar to many ofthe world’s largest countries and regions, extending for thousands of kilometersfrom north to south and thousands of kilometers from east to west. It’sunrealistic to suppose that, across such enormous distances over great expansesof time, the climate and environment in all areas would always remain the same.Of course there would be significant variations among the different regions andfrom epoch to epoch, and thus a danger of overenthusiastic extrapolation fromparticular instances to general conclusions.On March 12, 2018, therefore, I contacted Renato Cordeiro about the whole issueof the shifting consensus and what conclusions I might legitimately draw fromit. “I must confess,” I told him, “that expert opinion on the Ice Age Amazon isvery confusing and contradictory! I want to try to sort out the facts for myreaders, as those facts are understood now, if they are indeed subject to anykind of consensus today.”12 [part0051.html#note1446]Professor Cordeiro teaches geoeconomics at Brazil’s Universidad FederalFluminense. His rather technical reply, set out in full in the note, essentiallyrestated the conclusions of his 2017 paper, that the Amazon basin has alwayscontained rainforests, that the gallery forests along the rivers remained“relatively well preserved” even in drier periods, but that in other areas treecover has undergone considerable fluctuation over time.13[part0051.html#note1447]It was as close as I was able to get to some kind of answer to what I hadthought would be a simple question, namely, what sort of climate, environment,vegetation, and trees characterized the Amazon during the Ice Age? The scholarsdid not agree among themselves and many different pictures had been painted, butperhaps this was largely because of the immensity of the region and the complex,constantly changing, and often contradictory nature of the data.Indeed, there is only one thing I have been able to find that all the involvedscientists appear to be in complete agreement on, and this is that the regionwas significantly cooler during the Ice Age—5 or 6 degrees C cooler—than it isnow.14 [part0051.html#note1448] The year-round average temperature of the Amazonrainforest today is 80 degrees F (26.6 degrees C) so, if anything, a reductionof 5 degrees to 21.6 degrees C/75 degrees F would have been a bonus forprospective settlers.So … forests? Savanna? A mixture of both? Like so much else about the ancientAmazon, it seems there is no certain answer."},{"pageContent":"NOTESINTRODUCTION1 [part0006.html#note1a].

Going back as far as the last Ice Age, dates in calendar years turn outto be increasingly older than dates given in radiocarbon years so that, forexample, a radiocarbon age reading of 12,000 years ago corresponds, aftercalibration, with a calendar date of 13,800 years ago (see J.

Mann, 1491, 186, reports that fifty studies weredismissed. It is important to add, however, that Haynes’s dismissals were oftenentirely justified. For example, in 1951 a crucial piece of evidence thatHrdlička had suppressed during his tenure at the Smithsonianwas—commendably—brought to light by his successor T. Dale Stewart. Thedisclosure was low-profile, appearing only in the “Comments and Communications”section of the journal Science (April 6, 1951, 391), and it did not outrightaccuse Hrdlička of any malfeasance. The fact remained, nonetheless, that inHrdlička’s own files Stewart had found a paper published in the AmericanNaturalist in 1895, that Hrdlička had “failed to mention” when he published hisSkeletal Remains Suggesting or Attributed to Early Man in North America (Bureauof American Ethnology, Bulletin 33, 1907). “This might be expected, Stewartwrote: “Because Wilson’s conclusions are contrary to those of Hrdlička. Thelatter concluded on morphological grounds that the Natchez pelvic bone was thatof a recent Indian, whereas Wilson concluded from the fluorine content that thisbone was as ancient as an associated Mylodon bone.”Fossil bones absorb fluorine from soil and water, so fossils that have been inthe same soil for the same length of time should have roughly the same amount offluorine. The reason the paper caught Stewart’s eye in 1951 was that two yearspreviously, a fluorine test carried out on the remains of so-called Piltdown Manhad proved them to be hundreds of thousands of years younger than they weresupposed to be and set in motion the investigation that would lead in 1953 tothe exposure of this embarrassing archaeological fraud. For the latest researchon the Piltdown Man hoax see Isabelle De Groote et al., “New Genetic andMorphological Evidence Suggests a Single Hoaxer Created Piltdown Man,” RoyalSociety Open Science 3, no. 8 (August 1, 2016).For Hrdlička to have ignored the compelling implications of the fluorine testresults on the Natchez human pelvic bone, cutting-edge science in his day, was,to say the least, distinctly odd. He was vindicated, however, in April 1990 whenC. Vance Haynes was sent a sample of the Natchez bone for radiocarbon dating andreported a relatively recent age of around just 5,000 years (see John L. Cotter,“Update on Natchez Man,” American Antiquity 56, no. 1 (1991), 38). This turnedout to be about 12,000 years younger than the associated mylodon fossil (nowredesignated as Glossotherium harlani, a giant extinct ground sloth), which wasradiocarbon dated to more than 17,000 years before the present (pp. 38–39).How had the two deposits of entirely different age become so muddled up that theyounger one actually lay beneath the older one?The answer, and perhaps Hrdlička had noticed it, giving him what he wouldprobably have regarded as sufficient justification to ignore the 1895 fluorinepaper, was that the Natchez bone, together with the associated fossils ofextinct megafauna, had been excavated in a ravine from a deposit of clay, “thetalus of a neighboring cliff on of which were some old Indian graves.” When thefamed British geologist Sir Charles Lyell visited the site, he expressed theopinion that “although the human bone may have been contemporaneous with thoseof the extinct animals with which it had been found, he thought it more probableit had fallen from one of the Indian graves and had become mingled with theolder fossils which were dislodged from the deeper part of the cliff. … In thewear of the cliff the upper portion, with the Indian graves and human bones,would be likely to fall first and the deeper portion with the older fossilssubsequently on the latter” (Leidy cited in Cotter, “Update on Natchez Man,”37).44 [part0013.html#note132a].

Although the decisive shift came in 2014, TomDeméré states that the tide really began to turn in 2008 when archaeologistsSteve Holen and Kathleen Holen made their initial research visit to The Nat toexamine the Cerutti Mastodon materials.

Holen et al., “A 130,000-Year-Old Archaeological Site inSouthern California,” Nature (April 27, 2017).20 [part0014.html#note165a]. Other members of the team were George Jefferson,Paleontologist Emeritus with the Colorado Desert District Stout Research Center;Kathleen Maule Holen, M.S., M.A., Administrative Director at the Center forAmerican Paleolithic Research; Jared Beeton, Professor of Earth Science at AdamsState University; Adam Rountree of the University of Michigan’s Museum ofPaleontology, and Lawrence Vescera, Paleontologist at California State ParksColorado Desert District Stout Research Center in Borrego Springs.

The range of 140,000 to 120,000 years ago isapproximate, and Deméré himself (personal correspondence) prefers 130,000 yearsago down to about 115,000 years ago. There are nuances, as usual. For fulldetails of recent discussions around the dating of the Eemian, see “EemianInterglacial Reconstructed from a Greenland Folded Ice Core,” Nature 493(January 24, 2013), 489–494.22 [part0014.html#note167a]. Like our understanding of the origins ofcivilization, our understanding of human origins is undergoing somewhat of aparadigm shift. Around the time of the publication of Holen et al.’s CeruttiMastodon paper in April 2017, multiple studies have pushed the timing of theinitial migration of Homo sapiens out of Africa back so far that the “Out ofAfrica” paradigm—which has been firmly in place since 1924 when the firstAustralopithecus fossils were found in South Africa—has been questioned andalternative theories explored. In the same month as the Cerutti paper waspublished, the Dali skull from China was dated to 260,000 years ago, thusreviving the question of whether Homo sapiens originated in isolation in Africa.[Xuefeng Sun et al., “TT-OSL and Post-IR IRSL Dating of the Dali Man Site inCentral China,” Quaternary International 434 A (April 1, 2017), 99–106.] June2017 saw the results of Hublin et al.’s study on the 315,000–360,000-year-oldmodern human skeleton in Jebel Ihroud, Morocco, thus making East Africa’s statusas the “cradle of mankind” redundant. [Jean-Jaques Hublin et al., “New Fossilsfrom Jebel Ihroud, Morocco and the pan-African origin of Homo sapiens,” Nature546 (08 June 2017), 289–292.] July 2017 saw Clarkson et al.’s publication on theoccupation of northern Australia by 65,000 years ago, which altered the minimumdate of 60,000–50,000 years ago for the dispersal of anatomically modern humansout of Africa [Chris Stringer and Peter Andrews, “Genetic and Fossil Evidencefor the Origin of Modern Humans,” Science vol. 239, no. 4845 (March 11, 1988),1263–1268.] or made more likely the possibility that humans migrated fromAustralia to Africa at that time. [Bruce R. Fenton, The Forgotten Exodus: TheInto Africa Theory of Human Evolution (Independently Published, April 7, 2017).]In August 2017, the Dali skull was confirmed as being a hybrid Homo sapiens andHomo erectus hominin that has contributed significantly to the evolution ofChinese Homo sapiens, thus further complicating the story and entrenching EastAsia as a focal point of human origins. [Sheela Athreya and Xinzhi Wu, “AMultivariate Assessment of the Dali Hominin Cranium from China: MorphologicalAffinities and Implications for Pleistocene Evolution in East Asia” AmericanJournal of Physical Anthropology vol. 164 no. 4 (December 2017), 679–701.] InSeptember 2017, Schlebusch et al.’s study of ancient southern African genomesdeepened the divergence of modern humans from archaic humans to 350,000–260,000years ago, thus supporting a much earlier initial migration event through Asiato southern China. [Carina M. Schlebusch and Helena Malmström et al., “SouthernAfrican Ancient Genomes Estimate Modern Human Divergence to 350,000 to 260,000years ago,” Science 10.1126/science.aao6266 (September 28, 2017).] In light ofall this, on December 8, 2017, Bae, Douka, and Petraglia wrote a review inScience calling for the official revision of anatomically modern humanmigrations to account for the Eurasian findings:The identification of Neanderthals and Denisovans in Siberia … along withgrowing fossil and archaeological evidence for the presence of early modernhumans in East and Southeast Asia, much earlier than originally thought, placesthe spotlight on the evolutionary history of our species in Asia over the last125,000 years. Exciting and unanticipated new discoveries call for a need tocritically reexamine the Asian record.[Christopher J. Bae, Katerina Douka, Michael D. Petraglia, “On the Origin ofModern Humans: Asian Perspectives,” Science vol. 358 no. 6368 (December 8,2017).] Shortly after, on January 18, 2018, a team led by evolutionarygeneticist Deigan Yuang published a landmark paper suggesting that the Ychromosome and mitochondrial DNA originated in East Asia, thus calling for aserious reconsideration of the multiregional model of human origins. [DejianYuang et al., “Modern Human Origins: Multiregional Evolution of Autosomes andEast Asia Origin of Y and mtDNA,” bioRxiv (May 1, 2018).] Since then,archaeological findings revealing characteristics of early middle Paleolithicculture in India around 385–172 ka has made certain that the traditional “Out ofAfrica” model must at least be reframed. [Kumar Akhilesh et al., “Early MiddlePalaeolithic Culture in India Around 385–172ka reframes Out of Africa Models,”Nature 554 (February 1, 2018), 97–101.] The current consensus among thoseinterpreting human origins from within the “Out of Africa” framework is markedby the publication of a paper written by twenty-five scholars from institutionsaround the world entitled, “Did Our Species Evolve in Subdivided PopulationsAcross Africa, and Why Does It Matter?” The abstract reads:We challenge the view that our species, Homo sapiens, evolved within a singlepopulation and/or region of Africa. The chronology and physical diversity ofPleistocene human fossils suggest that morphologically varied populationspertaining to the H. sapiens clade lived throughout Africa. Similarly, theAfrican archaeological record demonstrates the polycentric origin andpersistence of regionally distinct Pleistocene material culture in a variety ofpaleoecological settings. Genetic studies also indicate that present-daypopulation structure within Africa extends to deep times, paralleling apaleoenvironmental record of shifting and fractured habitable zones. We arguethat these fields support an emerging view of a highly structured Africanprehistory that should be considered in human evolutionary inferences, promptingnew interpretations, questions, and interdisciplinary research directions.[Eleanor Scerri et al., “Did Our Species Evolve in Subdivided Populations AcrossAfrica, and Why Does it Matter?” Trends In Ecology & Evolution vol. 33, no. 8(August 2018), 582–594.] Also see the somewhat convincing, albeit controversial,interpretation of anthropologist German Dziebel, “The End of Out-of-Africa: ACopernican Reassessment of the Patterns of Genetic Variation in the Old World”(November 13, 2013),http://anthropogenesis.kinshipstudies.org/blog/2013/11/11/the-end-of-out-of-africa-a-copernican-reassessment-of-the-patterns-of-genetic-variation-in-the-old-world/[http://anthropogenesis.kinshipstudies.org/blog/2013/11/11/the-end-of-out-of-africa-a-copernican-reassessment-of-the-patterns-of-genetic-variation-in-the-old-world/].23 [part0014.html#note168a]. Tom Deméré adds (personal communication): “The sitewas excavated over a 5 month period and eventually unearthed 50m2 of thebone-and-stone-bearing bed. The resulting bone and stone distribution mappresented a pattern of 2 work stations with concentrations of objects.”24 [part0014.html#note169a].

Tom Deméré adds (personal communication):“Actually, we suggest that there are ‘tools’ at the CMS—the hammerstones andanvils are expedient tools not manufactured tools. Such ‘tools’ were probablythe ‘first’ tools used by hominins.”26 [part0014.html#note171a].

Also see pp. 14–15, “Weathering”:“Evidence indicating weathering of bone at the CM site is variable. The majorityof limb bones do not exhibit extensive weathering cracks (i.e., weathering stage0 or 110), while ribs and vertebrae exhibit some cracks that represent wettingand drying processes and/or diagenetic processes related to formation ofpedogenic carbonate (caliche). All weathering-like features appear to post-datethe disarticulation and burial of CM bones. In addition, some limb elementfragments (e.g., CM-288) with unweathered surfaces are spirally-fractured, withsmooth curvilinear fracture planes indicating that the bone was broken while itwas still fresh.”For visual 3D evidence of the limb element fragments on CM-288 go to theUniversity of Michigan, “Online Repository of Fossils,” Museum of Paleontology,“The Cerutti Mastodon Site,” “Bone Fragments,” “Specimen: SDSNH 49926, Taxon:Mammut americanum, Element: CM 288; bone fragment:https://umorf.ummp.lsa.umich.edu/wp/wp-content/3d/viewer.html?name=1244&extension=ctm[https://umorf.ummp.lsa.umich.edu/wp/wp-content/3d/viewer.html?name=1244&extension=ctm].See also “Supplementary Information,” pp. 15–16, “Geologic Processes ofProboscidean Limb Bone Modification:” “Post-depositional dry-bone fracturing, asevidenced by longitudinal and perpendicular fracture planes with rough surfacesis distinguished from the spiral fracture patterns produced by dynamicfracturing of fresh bone noted on the majority of CM limb bone fragments. Thereis no evidence at the CM site that geological processes caused breakage of freshmastodon limb bones” and, “Two biologic processes, carnivoran gnawing andtrampling by large mammals, are known to fracture bone. However, fresh corticalproboscidean limb bone is rarely broken by either agent.”See also p. 18: “Fracturing of proboscidean limb bones while still fresh is rarein modern single-elephant death sites, and no sites have been documented likethe CM site, where fresh elephant limb bone is broken into numerous smallspirally fractured fragments with evidence of multiple impacts. … The femoraldiaphyses found at the CM site are broken into small spirally-fractured pieces,whereas more fragile bones like ribs and vertebrae are complete, or morecomplete than the heavier and denser limb bones. This pattern of differentialbreakage is exactly the opposite of what is found where proboscidean bones havebeen extensively trampled. Under trampling, the lightest bones (e.g., ribs andvertebrae) are broken first and into much smaller pieces than the limb bonesthat have thicker cortical walls resistant to breakage.”Also see “Extended Data,” Figure 4a–e: Diagnostic anvil wear on CM bone,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22065/figures/8[https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22065/figures/8], as well asSupplementary Video 3 and Extended Data Figure 8: Experimental hammerstonepercussion of elephant bone:https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22065/figures/12[https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22065/figures/12].32 [part0014.html#note177a].

The Southeast-American Early Archaic period isconventionally dated to 10,000 to 8,000 BP. The beginning of the period, at10,000 BP, was marked in accordance with conventional geological dating of thePleistocene/Holocene boundary, while the end of the period, 8,000 BP, is usuallyequated with the Hypsithermsal warming episode.

Skip to note 11 of thischapter for a list of studies that have since rendered this argument inassociation with the Topper Palaeolithic terrace untenable.8 [part0015.html#note187a]. It was in November 2004 that the radiocarbon resultsof carbonized plant remains where artifacts excavated in May from along theSavannah River in Allendale County first came back. See “New Evidence Puts Manin North America 50,000 Years Ago,” Science Daily (November 18, 2004),https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/11/041118104010.htm[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/11/041118104010.htm].The Pleistocene antiquity of the site and artifacts found within it were thenreaffirmed in 2009 by a team led by Michael R. Waters, in a paper titled“Geoarchaeological Investigations at the Topper and Big Pine Tree Sites,Allendale County, South Carolina,” in the Journal of Archaeological Science.See, for example, p. 1305: “Six samples of wood, nutshell, and humic acids weredated from unit 1a (Figs. 4 and 5). These dates represent minimum ages for unit1a and indicate that this unit dates in excess of 50,000 14C yr B.P. A date of>54,700 14C yr B.P.

(CAMS-19023) on a piece of fir wood (Abies) froman organic horizon within unit 1a underlying the reported oldest culturalhorizon at the Topper site.” It was from unit 1a of the Pleistocene terrace thatdistinctive bend-break tools were recovered.9 [part0015.html#note188a]. Albert C. Goodyear, “Evidence of Pre-Clovis Sites inthe Eastern United States,” Paleoamerican Origins Beyond Clovis (2005), 103–112.10 [part0015.html#note189a]. A. C. Goodyear and D. A. Slain, “The Pre-ClovisOccupation of the Topper Site, Allendale County, South Carolina,” in A. C.Goodyear and C. R. Moore, Early Human Life on the Southeastern Coastal Plain(University Press of Florida, 2018), S30.11 [part0015.html#note190a]. The natural vs. human creation of the materialsexcavated from a Pleistocene terrace at Topper was evaluated by Douglas Slainand presented at the 81st Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology(SAA) in Orlando, Florida, on April 8, 2016. The content of this presentation isdocumented in D. Slain, “Pre-Clovis at Topper (38AL23): Evaluating the Role ofHuman Versus Natural Agency in the Formation of Lithic Deposits from aPleistocene Terrace in the American Southeast,” The Selected Works of DouglasSlain (April 8, 2016). In this paper, Slain concludes, “The weatheringsimulations produced lithic detachments that fit the morphological descriptionof bend breaks. However, as these detachments did not have technologicalattributes consisting of either compression rings, bulbs of force, or impactmarkers, these items should not be mistaken for the byproducts of intentionalbiface, or bipolar technologies. In other words, detachments resulting fromnatural weathering processes often exhibit morphological similarity to culturaldebitage, but lack the technological attributes of a chipped stone reductivetechnology” (p. 7). Consequently, “Evidence from this study supports King’s(2012) findings and demonstrates a human origin for the pre-Clovis flakeassemblage at the site” (p. 8). The M. King study, “MA Thesis Title: TheDistribution of Paleoindian Debitage from the Pleistocene Terrace at the TopperSite: An Evaluation of a Possible Pre-Clovis Occupation (38Al23)” (University ofTennessee, 2012) is indeed consistent with Slain in concluding that “the datasupports the notion that the pre-Clovis debitage was manmade” (p. 137).12 [part0015.html#note191a].

There have been a few theories, generally regardedby the academic establishment as “zany,” “lunatic,” or worse, that haveattempted to argue that prehistoric settlement also occurred from Europe by boatacross the Atlantic Ocean. Among these, the most credible is the so-calledSolutrean theory of Clovis origins put forward by Dennis J. Stanford, curator ofarchaeology and director of the Paleoindian Program at the Smithsonian’sNational Museum of Natural History, and his fellow researcher and coauthor BruceA. Bradley, associate professor in archaeology and director of the ExperimentalArchaeology program at the University of Exeter. See Dennis J. Stanford andBruce A. Bradley, Across Atlantic Ice: The Origin of America’s Clovis Culture(University of California Press, 2012).To cut a very long story very short indeed, Stanford and Bradley strongly resistwhat they call “the preconceived notion of geneticists and archaeologists thatthe Americas must have been settled by Asians” (p. 246). Their argument,instead, is that “Clovis predecessors were immigrants from southwestern Europe”and that this wave of immigration took place during the last glacial maximum (p.247), in other words, somewhere around 22,000 years ago. Their claim is based onthe—admittedly stunningly close—morphological resemblances between bifacialprojectile points made by the “Solutrean” culture of Upper Paleolithic westernEurope between roughly 22,000 and 17,000 years ago, and almost identicalbifacial projectile points made with an almost identical technique by NorthAmerica’s “Clovis” culture over a period of less than 1,000 years beginningroughly 13,400 years ago.The gap of several thousand years between the end of the Solutreans and thebeginning of Clovis is one among many reasons why the majority of archaeologistsreject Stanford and Bradley’s unusually daring theory, while more recent geneticresearch claims to have refuted it completely. See Morten Rasmussen et al., “TheGenome of a Late Pleistocene Human from a Clovis Burial Site in WesternMontana,” 228. See also Jennifer A. Raff and Deborah Bolnick, “Genetic Roots ofthe First Americans,” Nature 506 (February 13, 2014), 162. Indeed Raff andBolnick of the University of Texas have such confidence in this new researchthat they conclude: “Unless proponents offer evidence of direct Europeanancestry in other securely dated ancient American genomes, the Solutreanhypothesis can no longer be treated as a credible alternative for Clovis (orNative American) origins. It is time to move on to more interesting questions.”8 [part0017.html#note212a]. See part 2 of America Before.9 [part0017.html#note213a]. A major multidisciplinary study published in 2016 inNature pointed out that the supposed “ice-free” corridor would have beencompletely uninhabitable until 12,600 years ago (Mikkel W. Pedersen et al.,“Postglacial Viability and Colonization in North America’s Ice-Free Corridor,”Nature 537 no. 7618 (2016), 45). The authors demonstrate this by means ofancient DNA from the bottom of glacial lakes. This suggests that the “first”Americans did not arrive by land, but by sea. This is supported by a studyundertaken by a team from the University of California, who reconstructed familytrees for bison that lived in the “ice free” corridor and demonstrated that itwasn’t habitable until 13,000 years ago (Peter. D. Heintzman et al., “BisonPhylogeography Constrains Dispersal and Viability of the Ice Free Corridor inWestern Canada,” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 113, no. 29(2016), 8057–8063). Though these studies do not rule out the possibility thatthe “first” Americans reached the Americas via the Bering land bridge andice-free corridor as Clovis proponents contend, they do enhance the likelihoodthat early Americans favored sea over land crossings.10 [part0017.html#note214a].

Svante Pääbo comments, “The one place where we are sure allthree human forms have lived at one time or another is here in Denisova Cave.”In 2010, a Neanderthal toe bone was discovered in Denisova Cave. The results ofits morphological analysis are documented in M. B. Mednikova, “A Proximal PedalPhalanx of a Paleolithic Hominin from Denisova Cave, Altai,” Archaeology,Ethnology and Anthropology of Eurasia 39, no. 1 (2011). Radiocarbon dating ofthe organic material found above the toe revealed that the Neanderthal roamedthe cave at least 50,000 years ago. In S. Brown et al., “Identification of a NewHominin Bone from Denisova Cave, Siberia, Using Collagen Fingerprinting andMitochondrial DNA Analysis,” Scientific Reports 6, no. 25339 (March 29, 2016), asample taken from layer 12 from the East Gallery of the cave was found throughmtDNA analysis to be from a >50,000-year-old Neanderthal. Then, in 2017,researchers successfully sequenced soil samples from the Cave for DNA;Neanderthal DNA was detected in layer 15 from the Main Gallery, and layer 14from the East Gallery at a depth deeper than any fossilized remains or artifactshave been found (V. Slon et al., “Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA from PleistoceneSediments,” Science 356, no. 6338 [May 12, 2017]: 605–608). Frequent occupationsof Denisova Cave by Neanderthals are supported by the Mousterian artifacts,generally associated with Neanderthals, that have been excavated there. Theeditors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, in “Denisova Cave,”https://www.britannica.com/place/Denisova-Cave[https://www.britannica.com/place/Denisova-Cave] (last updated February 8,2018), state that there is “evidence of 13 separate occupations occurringbetween 125,000 and 30,000 years ago … supported by the presence of artifactsfrom the Acheulean, Mousterian, and Levalloisian stone-flaking industries,” allof which are associated with Neanderthals.8 [part0018.html#note232a]. The first conclusive evidence that anatomicallymodern humans interbred with Neanderthals was established in 2010 by R. E. Greenet al., “A Draft Sequence of the Neanderthal Genome,” Science 328, no. 5979 (May7, 2010), 710–722. The investigators conclude, on the basis of remains fromCroatia, that “between 1 and 4% of the genomes of people in Eurasia are derivedfrom Neandertals” (p. 721). Then, an investigation by K. Prüfer et al., “TheComplete Genome Sequence of a Neanderthal from the Altai Mountains,” Nature 505(January 2, 2014), concluded that “the proportion of Neanderthal-derived DNA inpeople outside Africa is 1.5–2.1%” (p. 45). All these results are consistentwith Q. Fu et al.’s findings in “An Early Modern Human from Romania with aRecent Neanderthal Ancestor,” Nature 524 (August 13, 2015), 216–219, in whichthe 37,000–42,000-year-old was confirmed as having 6–9 percent of its genomederived from Neanderthals (p. 216). The most recent and accurate investigationon modern human and Neanderthal interbreeding was, however, led by K. Prüfer, “AHigh-Coverage Neanderthal Genome from Vindija Cave in Croatia,” Science 358(November 3, 2017), 655–658. In this study, non-African populations outsideOceania are found to carry between 1.8 and 2.6 percent Neanderthal DNA, EastAsians are found to carry 2.3–2.6 percent Neanderthal DNA, and Western Eurasianscarry 1.8–2.4 percent. The amount of Neanderthal DNA carried by current modernhumans can therefore be estimated as being in the realm of 0–4 percent.9 [part0018.html#note233a].

The historical explanation for this isunsurprisingly rooted in early-twentieth-century interpretations of humanorigins. See, for example, Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, “LaChapelle-aux-Saints,”http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/fossils/la-chapelle-aux-saints[http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/fossils/la-chapelle-aux-saints](accessed March 12, 2018), “The original reconstruction of the ‘Old Man of LaChapelle’ by scientist Pierre Marcellin Boule led to the reason why popularculture stereotyped Neanderthals as dim-witted brutes for so many years. In1911, Boule reconstructed this skeleton with a severely curved spine indicativeof a stooped, slouching stance with bent knees, forward flexed hips, and thehead jutted forward. He thought the low vaulted cranium and the large browridge, somewhat reminiscent of that seen in large apes such as gorillas,indicated a generally primitive early human and a lack of intelligence.”The Neanderthal discovery took place within the Victorian epoch in which theWestern white man sought to excuse his domination and colonization of the worldby means of cultural and racial hegemony, namely “scientific racism” (alsotermed “eugenics”). It is unsurprising that Neanderthals, a species consideredmore primitive than the most “primitive” early-twentieth-century humans, wereinstantly assumed to be intellectually and creatively incapable and totallyunable to enjoy abilities reserved for “civilised” white modern humans.21 [part0018.html#note245a]. Archaeologist Ralph Solecki’s 1971 book, Shanidar:The First Flower People, was seminal in the consensus change on Neanderthalintelligence. Solecki’s article based on the book is available in Science 190 as“Shanidar IV, a Neanderthal Flower Burial in Northern Iraq” (880–881). Theabstract reads: “The discovery of pollen clusters of different kinds of flowersin the grave of one of the Neanderthals, No. IV, at Shanidar Cave, Iraq,furthers our acceptance of the Neanderthals in our line of evolution. Itsuggests that, although the body was archaic, the spirit was modern.”Since then, a stream of studies supporting this hypothesis have been published,establishing Neanderthals as not only socially intelligent, compassionate, andsensitive humans, but also as culturally and technologically advanced andartistic.

Which Middle Pleistocene species of human the Simade los Huesos (SH) hominins of Spain belonged to—either the Denisovans ofsouthern Siberia or the Neanderthals of western Eurasia—adds an interestingnuance to the archaeological evasiveness of the Denisovans, however. While theSH hominins share morphological features and nuclear DNA with Neanderthals, themtDNA of one SH individual is more closely related to the mtDNA of Denisovansthan to that of Neanderthals. Whether or not the Denisovans can be termed aseparate species to the Neanderthals and SH hominins has therefore been put todoubt.For studies concluding upon the morphological affinity of the SH hominins toNeanderthals, see I.

Arsuaga, “The Temporal Bones from Simade los Huesos Middle Pleistocene Site (Sierra de Atapuerca, Spain): APhylogenetic Approach,” Journal of Human Evolution 33 (1993), 283–318; M.Martinón-Torres et al., “Morphological Description and Comparison of the DentalRemains from Atapuerca-Sima de los Huesos Site (Spain),” Journal of HumanEvolution 62 (2012), 7–58; J.

As of July 2018, it has been known that a speciesof Homo reached central China by 2.12 million years ago (Z. Zhu et al., “HomininOccupation of the Chinese Loess Plateau Since About 2.1 Million Years Ago,”Nature [July 11, 2018]). Whether this species of Homo migrated there from Africaor originated somewhere in East Asia, perhaps even China, is up for debate. Whatis for certain, is that evidence for the advanced exploratory abilities of themost ancient hominins like Homo erectus is mounting and becoming harder to deny.For the most comprehensive documentation of Homo erectus and other early hominintechnological—most notably maritime—abilities, see R. Bednarik, “The MaritimeDispersal of Pleistocene Humans,” Migration and Diffusion 3, no. 10 (2002),6–33; R. G. Bednarik, “The Beginnings of Maritime Travel,” Advances inAnthropology 4, no. 4) (2014), 209; and R. G. Bednarik, “An Experiment inPleistocene Seafaring,” International Journal of Nautical Archaeology 27, no. 2(1998), 139–149.For the viability of early hominin maritime dispersal, consult work by SueO’Connor, for example, S. O’Connor et al., “Hominin Dispersal and SettlementEast of Huxley’s Line: The Role of Sea Level Changes, Island Size, andSubsistence Behavior,” Current Anthropology 58, no. S17 (2017), S567–S582; S.Kealy, J. Louys, and S.

F.Strasser et al., “Dating Palaeolithic Sites in Southwestern Crete, Greece,”Journal of Quaternary Science 26, no. 5 (2011), 553–560. Crete has beenseparated from mainland Greece since the Miocene 6 million to 5 million yearsago, so the presence of Pleistocene-age arteiacts there proves conclusively thatearly hominins were able to—and indeed did—make substantial sea crossings andexplore more of the world than we hitherto gave them credit for.Also see T. Ingicco et al., “Earliest Known Hominin Activity in the Philippinesby 709 Thousand Years Ago,” Nature 557, no. 7704 (2018), 233. This paper “pushesback the proven period of colonisation of the Philippines by hundreds ofthousands of years, and furthermore suggests that early overseas dispersal inIsland South East Asia by premodern hominins took place several times during theEarly and Middle Pleistocene stages.”19 [part0019.html#note310a]. “About 1/3 of the genome of all native Americanscomes from Mal’ta or a population closely related to it.

The challenge posed to scholars of the “deliberatevoyaging” school is the unconvincing argument that ancient hominins were“accidentally” transported across the sea by natural events like storms andtsunamis. See, for instance, comment from archaeologist Matthew Sprigs in R.Bednarik, “The Maritime Dispersals of Pleistocene Humans,” p. 55: “GivenBednarik’s ongoing search to find out how sea barriers cannot be crossed, onewonders on what basis he can be so certain that colonization cannot have beenaccidental, by being caught up in strong currents.”Among a mass of evidence is a paper by T. F. Strasser et al., “DatingPalaeolithic Sites in Southwestern Crete, Greece,” Journal of Quaternary Science26, no. 5 (2011), 553–560. Crete has been separated from mainland Greece sincethe Miocene 6–5 million years ago, so the presence of Pleistocene-age artifactsthere proves conclusively that early hominins made sea crossings (unless one iswilling to argue that ancient hominins were “accidentally” transported theapproximate 500 miles there from mainland Greece or 600 miles there frommainland Turkey via islands).The recent analysis of rock art in Asphendou Cave, Crete, fashioning a speciesof deer, Candiacervus, that has been extinct on the island for at least 11,000years, indicates that hominins conclusively reached Crete at least 11,000 yearsago: if they could create art then why could they not create boats? See T. F.Strasser et al., (2018). “Palaeolithic Cave Art from Crete, Greece,” Journal ofArchaeological Science: Reports 18 (2018), 100–108, esp. p. 103, “ifCandiacervus, then they date earlier than the end of the Palaeolithic at least11 thousand years ago,” and p. 107, “The last occurrence of the Cretan dwarfdeer Candiacervus sometime after 21,500 years ago provides a terminus ante quemfor the earliest layer of the Asphendou Cave rock carvings and confirms them asthe oldest figural art found in Greece.”Also see T. Ingicco et al., “Earliest Known Hominin Activity in the Philippinesby 709 Thousand Years Ago,” Nature 557, no. 7704 (2018), 233. This paper “pushesback the proven period of colonisation of the Philippines by hundreds ofthousands of years, and furthermore suggests that early overseas dispersal inIsland South East Asia by premodern hominins took place several times during theEarly and Middle Pleistocene stages.”8 [part0020.html#note355a].

Bednarik, “The Beginnings of Maritime Travel,” Advances inAnthropology (January 2014), 209: “The maritime history of humanity commencednot a few thousand years ago, as traditional nautical archaeology has tended toassume, but more than a hundred times as long ago … Archaeological data fromWallacea (Indonesia) have shown that the history of seafaring began in the latepart of the Early Pleistocene, at least 900 ka (900,000 years) ago. Tounderstand better the technological magnitude of these very early maritimeaccomplishments, expeditions are currently engaged in a series of replicativeexperiments.”9 [part0020.html#note356a].

Sondaar, “MiddlePleistocene Faunal Turnover and Colonization of Flores (Indonesia) by Homoerectus,” Comptes Rendus de l’Academie des Sciences 319 (1994), 1255: “Severalstone artefacts have been found in a uvial sandstone layer belonging to the OlaBula Formation, near Mata Menge in the Ngada District, West Central Flores,Indonesia … indicating an age of slightly less than 0.73 Ma BP. is relativelyold age suggests that the artefacts are the work of Homo erectus.” Also seeIngicco et al., “Earliest Known Hominin Activity in the Philippines by 709thousand Years Ago,” 233.10 [part0020.html#note357a]. The two papers that established the consensus of3,500 years ago for the Polynesian expansion are I. D. Goodwin, S. A. Browning,and A. J.

Having said that, mainstream academia has begun tochange its tune. Quoted in a Science news article from April 24, 2018, is“initial skeptic” of prehistoric human seafaring abilities John Cherry of BrownUniversity: “The orthodoxy until pretty recently was that you don’t haveseafarers until the early Bronze Age. … Now we are talking about seafaringNeandertals. It’s a pretty stunning change.” Quoted in the same article isCurtis Runnels of Boston University, co-leader of the 2008 and 2009 Creteexcavations: “We severely miscalculated. … The seas were more permeable than wethought” (A.

But for an opposing interpretation, see Skoglund etal., “Genetic Evidence for Two Founding Populations of the Americas,” 104: “Thecoefficients for which non-American populations contribute the most to thesignals separate Native Americans into a cline with two Amazonian groups (Suruiand Karitiana) on one extreme and Mesoamericans on the other. … Among theoutgroups, the most similar coefficients to Amazonian groups are found inAustralasian populations: the Onge from the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal(a so-called ‘Negrito’ group), New Guineans, Papuans and indigenousAustralians.” (Emphasis added.)21 [part0020.html#note368a]. Ibid.22 [part0020.html#note369a]. The Denisovan signal across Native Americanpopulations is presently estimated to be between 0.13 and 0.17 percent, not somuch on the basis of genomic surveys but of more estimations: “As it waspreviously estimated that the Denisovan-related ancestry in … [Native American]populations is 3.8 percent to 4.8 percent of that in Oceania … combining thisinformation with our new estimate of approximately 3.5 percent Denisovanancestry in New Guinea and Australia leads to estimates of Denisovan ancestry in… [Native American] populations of 0.13 percent–0.17 percent.” See Pengfei Qinand Mark Stoneking, “Denisovan Ancestry in East Eurasian and Native AmericanPopulations,” Molecular Biology and Evolution 32, no. 10 (2015), 2671.23 [part0020.html#note370a].

Ibid., 172.3 [part0022.html#note383a]. Ibid., 198: “There was one settlement that stretchedfor five leagues without any intervening space from house to house, which was amarvellous thing to behold.” Commenting on this observation, Professor DavidWilkinson of UCLA notes that the exact length of a “league” was “not a fullyagreed-upon or stabilized physical distance, but was probably not less than 2.5English statute miles nor more than 4.” See David Wilkinson, “AmazonianCivilization?” Comparative Civilizations Review 74, no. 74 (Spring 2016), 96. Atthe minimum measure, therefore, 5 leagues equals 12.5 miles (20.1 kilometers),while at the maximum measure, 5 leagues equals 20 miles (32.2 kilometers). Itseems safe, therefore, to summarize the extent of this settlement as “more than20 kilometers.”4 [part0022.html#note384a].

See, for example, Spanish historian Francisco Lòpezde Gomara, quoted in Medina, The Discovery of the Amazon According to theAccount of Friar Gaspar de Carvajal and Other Documents, 25–26, who in 1552described Carvajal’s journal as being “full of lies.” However, Carvajal actuallyvisited the Amazon, whereas Gomara did not. Furthermore, Gomara was evidentlymore criticized by his sixteenth-century contemporaries for distortinghistorical truth than Carvajal was; on November 17, 1553, Prince Phillip ofSpain imposed a penalty of 200,000 maravedis on anyone who would reprintGomara’s historically inaccurate work.17 [part0022.html#note397a]. Heaton, The Discovery of the Amazon According tothe Account of Friar Gaspar de Carvajal and Other Documents, 214: “Our Lord waspleased to give strength and courage to our companions, who killed seven oreight (for these we actually saw) of the Amazons, whereupon the Indians lostheart.” Carvajal clearly distinguishes between the “women warriors” or “theAmazons” and “the Indians” here.18 [part0022.html#note398a]. Ibid., 214.19 [part0022.html#note399a]. Ibid., 212–214, 220–221.20 [part0022.html#note400a]. Ibid., 221.21 [part0022.html#note401a]. By 1541 the fierce Amazonian women warriors hadmade an especially significant appearance in literary culture and were becomingembedded in the European imagination. For example, they featured heavily in “Lassergas de Esplandan,” a sequel to the Amadis of Gaul cycle, which was firstpublished in 1510 and widely circulated. For a good documentation of Europeanimagination of the Amazons, see E. Pink, “The Amazons of the Americas: BetweenMyth and Reality,” available here via Newcastle University:https://www.societies.ncl.ac.uk/pgfnewcastle/files/2015/03/Pink-The-Amazons-of-the-Americans.pdf[https://www.societies.ncl.ac.uk/pgfnewcastle/files/2015/03/Pink-The-Amazons-of-the-Americans.pdf].22 [part0022.html#note402a]. Heaton, The Discovery of the Amazon According tothe Account of Friar Gaspar de Carvajal and Other Documents. Most agree that theAmazon got its name from the women of the Tupya tribe against whom Orellanabattled, as they reminded him of the female Amazon warriors of Greek legend.This is evident in Carvajal’s account, for he explains, “In the years whichfollowed Orellana’s expedition the name Marañón … was abandoned, and the riverbegan to more generally be known as the River of the Amazons.” At times, also,it was referred to under the name of its discoverer. An instance of this may beseen in the articles of agreement drawn up by order of the king, under the dateof August 11, 1552, empowering Gerónimo de Aguayo “to go to the provinces of theAruacas and of the Amazons,” who are located, as this document reads, “[in aregion stretching away] from the mouth of the Orellana River, called by anothername The Amazons” (162–163). (Emphasis added.) Supporting this are words of thefiercest critic of Carvajal, López de Gómara, who is quoted by Medina in hisintroduction to Carvajal’s account as saying, “Among the extravagant statementswhich he made was his claim that there were Amazons along this river with whomhe and his companions had fought. … Because of this imposture, already manywrite and say ‘River of the Amazons,’ and there have gathered together so manyparties to go there” (26).23 [part0022.html#note403a].

See for example the population estimates of Jan DeVries in European Urbanisation, 1500–1800 (Methuen, 1984), 28: “Of the perhaps3000–4000 settlements in Europe that were vested with city rights of one form oranother, or were otherwise acknowledged to be urban places around 1500, only 154were inhabited by 10,000 or more people, and only 4 contained as many as100,000. …” Also of note is that the whole of Scandinavia is estimated as havinghad a total urban population of 13,000 in 1500, which is just over half the sizeof Wilkinson’s largest estimated Amazonian settlement (30).35 [part0022.html#note415a]. Admittedly, the population of London is estimatedas having fallen by a third following the bubonic plague. Even so, its estimatedpopulation of 60,000 in 1500 is revealing in the context of contemporaneousAmazonian urbanity.

The smallpox epidemic, to which the Aztecs had noimmunity, was probably the single key factor that ensured Spanish victory in theconquest. By the time Cortes and his conquistadors finally capturedTenochtitlan, the Aztec capital, most of its inhabitants were already dead—fromsmallpox. It is thought likely that the Inca emperor Huayna Capac died ofsmallpox in 1528, four years before the arrival of Pizarro’s forces in Peru,indicating strongly that the virus had traveled on trade networks from Mexico.If those networks were exclusively coastal, then smallpox might not have reachedthe Amazon until 1542. If they had been inland, then it is possible it couldhave done so a decade or so earlier. See, for example, D. R. Hopkins, TheGreatest Killer: Smallpox in History (University of Chicago Press, 2002),208–211: “The rumours of the Inca Empire that lured Balboa south were alsoevidence of communication, by land and by sea, between the Indians of Peru andthose living in Central America.” The author goes on to say that when smallpoxstruck the land of the Incas sometime around 1524–1527, it was almost certainlysmallpox imported from Central America.60 [part0022.html#note440a].

The fertility of terra preta is discussed at lengthin Scheub et al., Terra Preta, 6.25 [part0024.html#note511a]. WinklerPrins, “Terra Preta: The Mysterious Soils ofthe Amazon,” 236. The quoted passage continues: “In the generally high humidityand high rainfall environments such as found in the Amazon basin, most nutrientsin the soil mineralize and are leached out of the system quickly, and because ofthis, the vegetation of the region typically absorbs nutrients quickly from thesoil once these have been released in the soil through decomposition or otherprocesses.”26 [part0024.html#note512a]. Ibid.27 [part0024.html#note513a]. Ibid. “The carbon found in ADE’s is aromatic carbon(also known as black or pyrogenic carbon) that is likely a consequence of theincorporation of charcoal into the soil. … Soils with this type of carbon areable to retain, even attract nutrients, resulting in more plant-availablephosphorus, calcium, and nitrogen, as the aromatic carbon acts as a carryingagent for nutrients. Aromatic carbon is also known to be highly resistant todegradation.”28 [part0024.html#note514a]. Morris, “Putting the Carbon Back,” 625. The citedpassage continues: “They become homes for populations of microorganisms thatturn the soil into that spongy, fragrant, dark material that gardenerseverywhere love to plunge their hands into. The char is not the only good stuffin terra preta—additions such as excrement and bone probably play a role too—butit is the most important factor. Leaving aside the subtleties of how charparticles improve fertility, the sheer amount of carbon they can stash away isphenomenal.”29 [part0024.html#note515a]. William Balée, “Amazonian Dark Earths,” Tipiti:Journal of the Society for the Anthropology of Lowland South America 8, no. 1(2010), 5. Emphasis in the original. The cited passage goes on to state:“Biochar is believed to be the principal source of the color of the Amazon DarkEarths as well as the reason for retention of nutrients. Microbial activityleads to increased carbon sequestration. That is what makes ADEs of interest inresearch on climate change. The higher and more diverse the microbial activity,the better the soil, and ADE is richer and more diverse in microbes thansurrounding soils, even though millions of these species remain to be identifiedprecisely and literally a million separate taxa can be contained in only 10grams of soil. A significant proportion of the microbes in ADE are differentfrom the microbes in the surrounding primeval soils.”30 [part0024.html#note516a]. Glaser and Woods, Amazonian Dark Earths, 4.

However, this scenario seems unlikely if wethink about the following: we know manioc was domesticated—and thereforecultivated—by societies in the same region during the Girau phase, and probably,we have argued, by the Girau-period inhabitants themselves. In domesticatingmanioc, people not only improved various aspects such as the size and productionof its tubers, photosynthetic rates and seed functionality, but they did this byrepeated cycles of recombination and selection which involved clonal propagationas a viable reproductive mechanism (wild manioc cannot reproduce from stemcuttings).

Though the names ayahuasca and yagé both refer toessentially the same potion made from similar plants, the approach variesgreatly between ayahuasca and yagé. For example, yagé bark is usually poundedoff, leaving only the woody core of the vine to be boiled; these brews containless tannins and cause less vomiting than ayahuasca brews, which are usuallyprepared with the bark left on the vine. Ayahuasca bark is usually only slightlyrasped and pounded before being boiled, leaving more tannins in the brew,causing a more powerful purgative effect in the recipient. The DMT element ofyagé is not derived from Psychotria viridis (chacruna) but is derived fromanother vine, Diplopterys cabrerana, which contains both N,N-DMT and 5-MeO-DMT.Further information available in J. M. Weisberger, Rainforest Medicine:Preserving Indigenous Science and Biodiversity in the Upper Amazon (NorthAtlantic Books, 2013).

The extensive empirical research I have subsequently conductedcorroborated these first impressions and led me to conclude that there arestriking cross-personal commonalities in the contents of Ayahuasca visions, intheir themes, and in the ideations that are associated with them.”41 [part0028.html#note725a].

The contrasting alternative to the “MoundbuilderMyth” arose among a set of scholars in the 1890s onward, most of whom weresponsored by the Bureau of American Ethnology and the Smithsonian Institution,who devoted their attention to surveying, mapping, and excavating earthworksites.

How far Judaism dates back and to what extent itsroots extend into prehistory is, however, debatable and obviously depends onwhat elements of the faith one traces. Most agree, however, that it dates atleast as far back as the establishment of the Iron Age Kingdom of Judah, c.tenth century BCE.63 [part0033.html#note868a]. A predominant archaeological link between the HinduShiva cult and the Indus Valley civilization is, for example, the Pasupati Seal,displaying the horned “animal” manifestation of Shiva, which was carbon dated to2500–2400 BC in the early twentieth century.

A selection of figurines and ritualimplements, along with a panoply of amulets and utilitarian objects from thislife, accompanied the body. Once placed in the tomb, the individual wouldsimultaneously move about in the realm where the dead were and also share in thecourse of the sun as it set and was reborn daily. The mobile ‘soul,’ the ba,soared up toward the daylight and then returned to animate its home base, theembalmed corpse in its coffin. The ka, the other ‘soul’ and the immaterialdouble of the material body, consumed the food and drink the survivors broughtto the funerary chapel, at the same time perpetuating, by speaking it out loud,the name of the person, which they could read on a stela. This wholesystem—which implies a far more complex anthropological representation of aliving, thinking being than our own—was believed to confer the potentialcapacities of a god on the deceased. The classical form of a sarcophagus—a mummywith the mask and the heavy wig that were proper to images of deities—served asthe hieroglyphic symbol for the idea of superior dignity (the Egyptian word wassah).”30 [part0037.html#note972a].

Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas, The HiramKey: Pharaohs, Freemasons and the Discovery of the Secret Scrolls of Christ(Arrow Books, 1997), 152: Knight and Lomas suggest that the ancient Egyptiansconsidered Horus to be the “Morning Star” when Osiris says in 1000–1 of thePyramid Texts:The reed-floats of the sky are set in place for me, that Imay cross by means of them to Re at the horizon … Iwill stand among them, for the moon is my brother, theMorning Star is my offspring.The authors go on to suggest that Pyramid Texts 357, 929, 935, and 1707 refer tothe dead king’s offspring—Horus—as being the morning star. On 153 they state,“In Egypt the new king, the Horus, is the morning star, arising (like the raisedFreemason) from a temporary and figurative death.” Also see Rolf Kraus, “Stellarand Solar Components in Ancient Egyptian Mythology and Royal Ideology,” inMichael A.

Anke Napp, “Priests ofAncient Egypt,” http://www.ancient-egypt-priests.com/AE-Life-english.htm[http://www.ancient-egypt-priests.com/AE-Life-english.htm]: “The high-rankingpriests wore sashes, probably with gold ornaments similar to the ones thePharaoh used, and a leopard skin. The leopard was considered a sacred animal,personification of the ancient sky-Goddess Mafdet. Perhaps the spots on the skinreminded the Ancient Egyptians of stars. Artificial leopard cloth hadstar-shaped items on it for the spots. A leopard skin was also seen as connectedto the beliefs of regeneration and rebirth in the afterlife, and with Sun GodRa. This can be traced back to the pyramid texts of the Fifth Dynasty. So inparticular the Sem-priests, who had to perform the rituals of inspiriting themummy before the funeral, wore this special garment, but also the deceasedperson! It can be seen as some sort of christening robe. Apart of the sash, theydo not wear any jewellery.” Also see Anand Balaji, “Sem Priests of AncientEgypt: Their Role and Impact in Funerary Contexts—Part 1” (Ancient Origins, May6, 2018),https://www.ancient-origins.net/history/sem-priests-ancient-egypt-their-role-and-impact-funerary-contexts-part-0010007[https://www.ancient-origins.net/history/sem-priests-ancient-egypt-their-role-and-impact-funerary-contexts-part-0010007]and part 2 here:https://www.ancient-origins.net/history/sem-priests-ancient-egypt-service-king-and-country-part-ii-0010009[https://www.ancient-origins.net/history/sem-priests-ancient-egypt-service-king-and-country-part-ii-0010009].See alsohttp://www.ancient-origins.net/history/sem-priests-ancient-egypt-their-role-and-impact-funerary-contexts-part-0010007[http://www.ancient-origins.net/history/sem-priests-ancient-egypt-their-role-and-impact-funerary-contexts-part-0010007]andhttp://www.ancient-origins.net/history/sem-priests-ancient-egypt-service-king-and-country-part-ii-0010009[http://www.ancient-origins.net/history/sem-priests-ancient-egypt-service-king-and-country-part-ii-0010009].142 [part0037.html#note1084a].

This loss was accompanied by a sudden expansionof Populus species (poplar, cottonwood, aspen) and sometimes Alnus (birch),which are opportunistic pioneers that often flourish following major forestdisruptions such as wildfires. In turn, Populus species were replaced byconifers during the remainder of the YD. Thus, a large, pervasive, temporarychange in continental vegetation, as reflected in the North American pollenrecord, is consistent with a major biotic perturbation that would have resultedfrom widespread biomass burning at the YDB.”62 [part0041.html#note1250a].

To give an extreme example ofthe kinds of problems this raises, although we can make informed guesses, wecannot know for sure whether every deceased Clovis infant was buried in the sameelaborate way with equally copious offerings of grave goods or whether Anzick-1was an exceptional burial of an exceptional individual, perhaps from someexceptional lineage.

Meltzer(email exchange July 23 and 24, 2018), GH: I’m inclined to say in the relevantchapter of the book I’m just completing on ancient America that reliable figuressimply don’t exist for the whole Mississippi Valley and that no archaeologist orother researcher has ever attempted to estimate what has been lost across thewhole region as a result of agricultural, industrial and other encroachmentssince the mid-19th century. Would that, in your opinion, be a true reflection ofthe state of knowledge on this issue, or would it be misleading? DJM: I thinkthat is an accurate statement, though again not having expertise in the area Icannot be certain. I also think it important to add that one of the reasons whysuch an estimate might be impossible is that 200+ years ago there was nosystematic count of these earthworks, so we have no idea what the denominatorshould be for the equation of “sites still extant / sites once present.” Add tothat the fact that the (un)systematic ballpark estimates of a Squier would notonly have failed to capture all the small mounds and hamlets, many of thosesites were probably plowed down without anyone (except the mule team doing thework) even noticing or recording.32 [part0045.html#note1342a].

Email from Graham Hancock to Professor RenatoCordeiro dated March 12, 2018.13 [part0049.html#note1447a]. Professor Cordeiro’s kind reply (email of March14, 2018) contained some technical terms that I feel I need to translate herebefore getting to the meat of what he said: * Quaternary—the reference is to our current era, roughly from 2.5 million years ago until the present. * Edaphic characteristics—the reference is to the role of factors such as water content, acidity, aeration, and the availability of nutrients, that is, factors inherent in the soil itself rather than consequent upon climate. * Campinaranas—these are neotropical ecoregions in the Brazilian Amazon. * Caatingas—another kind of ecoregion of the Brazilian Amazon, in this case characterized by desert vegetation. * Pollinic—the reference is to all matters relating to, containing, or derived from pollen.“In order to understand the vegetation fluctuations during the quaternary,”Professor Cordeiro told me, “one must try to understand some of the currentdistribution of vegetation. Basically in the Amazon we have evergreen forests,deciduous forests, tree savanna, shrub savanna, open savanna and fields. In someregions vegetation is influenced by edaphic characteristics such as thecampinaranas and caatingas of the Rio Negro where vast areas covered by quartzsands, with low nutrients and low water retention, limit the occurrence ofvegetation with large biomass. Along the rivers are the gallery forests which,probably have been relatively well preserved during drier climatic periods.Varzea forests (floodplain forest) are still distributed along flood areas andinundated forests (regionally called igapó) that occur inside the river beduntil 6 meters depth. This vegetation type mosaic produces variable amounts ofpollens and therefore different responses in the sedimentary records as afunction of the depositional environment (lakes near the Rios channel, e.g.,Lago Saci, Lago La Gaiba; lakes far from the dynamics of rivers e.g. CarajásLakes, Lagoa da Pata; marine deposits). As an example of this complexity ofinterpretations it is possible to mention that marine records have a pollinicsignal very influenced by galleries forests and floodplain forests that wouldhave been preserved during drier climatic periods. The Saci lake, because it isrelatively close to the São Benedito II River, probably had a vegetation withhigher biomass in relation to sites outside of the river influence. Therefore,due to this complexity between the generation of the different types of pollensof different vegetation types in relation to the depositional environment, manyinterpretations do not accurately depict the regional vegetation physiognomy.”14 [part0049.html#note1448a].
