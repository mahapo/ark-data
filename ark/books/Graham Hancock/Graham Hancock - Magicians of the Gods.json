She had her own successfulcareer long before she met me, but she kindly agreed to work with me. Santhatook the majority of the photographs in this book, as in so many of my previousbooks, and has traveled with me every step of the way on the long journey fromFingerprints of the Gods to Magicians of the Gods. Thank you! Thanks also to ourchildren Sean, Shanti, Ravi, Leila, Luke and Gabrielle. While I was writingMagicians our first grandchild, Nyla, was born and it is a delight to welcomeher to our big, boisterous family. Thanks too to my mum Muriel Hancock, and tomy uncle James Macaulay, and I keep in my heart fond memories of my dad, DonaldHancock, who taught me so much and who passed away in 2003 after years ofunstinting support for my work.My brilliant literary agent Sonia Land has worked wonders and is everything agreat agent should be. My UK editor Mark Booth and my US editor Peter Wolvertonhave both played hugely positive roles in nurturing Magicians of the Gods andputting it before the public in just the right way at just the right time.The graphics team who created the maps, charts, drawings and diagrams for thisbook were Camron Wiltshire and Afua Richardson, with backup from Michael Maudlinand Samuel Parker. My son Luke Hancock also provided a number of diagrams. Eachartist is acknowledged individually in the graphics credits but I want to thankthem all collectively here for their dedication, talent, intelligence and hardwork.The late Professor Klaus Schmidt of the German Archaeological Institute went farabove and beyond the call of duty when he showed me around Gobekli Tepe inTurkey in 2013. As the discoverer and excavator, Klaus possessed uniqueknowledge of this very special site that he generously shared with me duringthree days of visits and on-the-spot interviews. I regret his passing but trustthat his name will be remembered by history.I made a research visit to Lebanon in 2014. My work there was greatlyfacilitated by the kindness, good will and logistical support on the groundgiven by my friends Ramzi Najjar and Samir and Sandra Jarmakani. Subsequent tothe trip I benefited enormously from extensive correspondence concerning Baalbekwith archaeologist and architect Daniel Lohmann. He was patient and persuasivein his valiant efforts to persuade me of the merits of the mainstream analysis.In Indonesia special thanks go to Danny Hilman Natawidjaja, the excavator of theextraordinarily ancient pyramid site of Gunung Padang. Thanks also to hiscolleagues Wisnu Ariestika and Bambang Widoyko Suwargadi who joined us on anextensive field trip in Java, Sumatra, Flores and Sulawesi.In the United States I am particularly grateful to Randall Carlson for his deepinsights into catastrophist geology and for the knowledge he shared with meduring our journey by road from Portland, Oregon, to Minneapolis, Minnesota, tostudy the effects on the land of the cataclysmic floods that afflicted thisentire region at the end of the Ice Age. Thanks, too, to Bradley Young whoaccompanied us on the journey and did all the driving – a heroic effort!I am grateful to Allen West, corresponding author amongst the large group ofscientists investigating the Younger Dryas comet impact. I tell the story oftheir work at length in Chapters 3 through 6, and Allen was very helpful inensuring that I got the facts right and in offering me further insights into theimplications of the cataclysm.Thanks also to Richard Takkou and Raymond Wiley for their sterling efforts as myresearch assistants at different stages of the project.Many, many thanks to our dear friends Chris and Cathy Foyle for their solidarityand wise advice.And last but not least, thanks to my loyal and supportive readers all around theworld who have stuck with me for more than twenty years as I’ve pursued my questfor the lost civilization. Magicians of the Gods is the latest destination onthat journey and while it is a new work I have inevitably, at a few points, hadto revisit ground that I first explored in Fingerprints of the Gods and in myother books in order to place the new evidence I present here in its propercontext.Graham Hancock[http://us.macmillan.com/author/grahamhancock?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=grahamhancock_authorpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9781466846067]Bath, England, September 2015"},{"pageContent":" Introduction [part0131.html#c_intro]Sand [part0131.html#c_intro]A house raised on sand will always be in danger of collapse.The evidence is mounting, though most of the later construction is of highquality, that the edifice of our past built by historians and archaeologistsstands on defective and dangerously unsound foundations. An extinction-levelcataclysm occurred on our planet between 12,800 and 11,600 years ago. This eventwas global in its consequences and it affected mankind profoundly. Because thescientific evidence that proves it happened has only emerged since 2007, andbecause its implications have not yet been taken into account at all byhistorians and archaeologists, we are obliged to contemplate the possibilitythat everything we have been taught about the origins of civilization could bewrong.In particular it must be considered as a reasonable hypothesis that worldwidemyths of a golden age brought to an end by flood and fire are true, and that anentire episode of the human story was rubbed out in those 1,200 cataclysmicyears between 12,800 and 11,600 years ago—an episode not of unsophisticatedhunter-gatherers but of advanced civilization.Did that civilization, if it existed at all, leave any traces that we mightstill be able to identify today, despite the passage of so much time?

For the last couple of hours I’ve been wanderinground the site with its excavator, Professor Klaus Schmidt, and my mind isfrankly boggled.“How does it feel,” I ask him, “to be the man who discovered the temple that’srewriting history?”A rubicund German archaeologist with a barrel chest and a grizzled beard,Schmidt is wearing faded jeans, a blue denim shirt with a streak of mud on thesleeve, and scuffed sandals on his bare, dirty feet. It’s September 2013, threemonths before his sixtieth birthday and although neither of us know it yet,he’ll be dead in less than a year.As he ponders my question he wipes a bead of sweat from the glistening dome ofhis forehead. It’s not yet mid-morning but the sun is high here in Turkey’sSoutheastern Anatolia region, the sky is cloudless and the ridge of the Taurusmountains on which we stand is baking hot. There’s no breeze, not even a hint ora breath of air, nor is there any shade to be had. In 2014 a roof will beerected to cover and protect the site but in 2013 only its foundations are inplace so we’re standing exposed on a makeshift wooden walkway. Down below us ina series of semi-subterranean, more or less circular, walled enclosures are thedozens of giant T-shaped megalithic pillars that Schmidt and his team from theGerman Archaeological Institute have brought to light here. Before they begantheir work the place had the appearance of a rounded hill—in fact “Göbekli Tepe”means “Hill of the Navel”1 [part0108.html#chapter1-1] sometimes also translatedas “Potbelly Hill”2 [part0108.html#chapter1-2]—but the excavations have removedmost of that original profile.“Of course we cannot say that Göbekli Tepe is a temple exactly,” Schmidt answerseventually, obviously choosing his words with care. “Let us call it a hillsanctuary. And I do not claim that it is rewriting history. Rather I would saythat it is adding an important chapter to existing history. We thought that thetransition from hunter-gatherers to farmers was a slow, step-by-step process,but now we realize that it was a period when exciting monuments that we didn’texpect were made.”3 [part0108.html#chapter1-3]“And not just monuments,” I prompt. “At the beginning the local people werehunter-gatherers and there was no sign of agriculture.”“No,” Schmidt concedes, “none.” He gestures expansively at the circles ofpillars. “But the people who came to Göbekli Tepe, and who did all this work,invented agriculture! So we see a connection between what happened here and thelater emergence of Neolithic societies dependent on farming.”image [../images/00004.jpeg]Figure 2: The central group of excavated enclosures—A, B, C and D—at GobekliTepe. All the pillars have been numbered, for ease of reference, by the GermanArchaeological Institute.My ears prick up at that word “invented.” I want to be sure I’m getting thisright. “So,” I emphasize, “you go so far as to say that the people who madeGöbekli Tepe actually invented agriculture?”“Yes. Yes.”“Could you elaborate on that?”“Because in this region we have the early domesticates, both animals and plants.It’s done in this region. So they are the same people.”“And as far as you are concerned this is the first—the oldest—agriculture in theworld?”“The first in the world. Yes.”I sense that Schmidt is becoming impatient at the way I’m probing this point,but I have my reasons. The areas of Göbekli Tepe that have been excavated so farare close to 12,000 years old which makes them (according to orthodoxchronology) more than 6,000 years older than any other megalithic sitesanywhere—sites like Gigantiga and Mnajdra in Malta, Stonehenge and Avebury inEngland, or the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt. Yet those sites all belong to thatphase of the evolution of human civilization that archaeologists call the“Neolithic” (the “New Stone Age”) when agriculture and the organization ofsociety along structured, hierarchical lines were already well advanced,permitting the emergence of skilled specialists who had no need to produce theirown food because they could be supported from the surpluses generated byfarmers. Göbekli Tepe, by contrast, belongs to the very end of the “UpperPaleolithic,” the late “Old Stone Age” when our ancestors are supposed to havebeen nomadic hunter-gatherers living in small, mobile bands and incapable oftasks requiring long-term planning, complex division of labor and high-levelmanagement skills.Schmidt and I are standing at a point on the walkway that overlooks bothEnclosure C and Enclosure D, where I’ve learned from my background research ofan intriguing image carved on one of the pillars. I intend to ask thearchaeologist’s permission to climb down into Enclosure D so that I can take acloser look at this image, but I want to get his views about the origins ofagriculture, and its relationship to the megalithic architecture, completelyclear first. Enclosure C, the largest of the four main pits so far excavated, isdominated by two huge central pillars, both of which are broken. In theiroriginal state they would each have been more than 6 meters (20 feet) high andweighed around 20 tons. Inset into the wall around them stand a dozen otherpillars. They’re slightly smaller but still prodigious. The same goes forEnclosure D—again a ring of smaller pillars surrounding two towering centralpillars, in this case both intact. Their T-shaped tops, angled slightly down tothe front, have no features but are nonetheless eerily reminiscent of gianthuman heads—an impression that is reinforced by the faint outlines of arms,crooked at the elbow, running down the flanks of the pillars and terminating incarefully carved human hands with long fingers.“All this,” I say, “the megaliths, the iconography, the general conception andlayout of the site … to be honest it looks to be as big a project as a placelike Stonehenge in England, yet Stonehenge is much younger. So how does whatyou’ve found at Göbekli Tepe fit in with your notion of a hunter-gatherersociety?”“It’s much more organized than we expected,” Schmidt allows. “What we can seehere are hunter-gatherers who obviously had a division of labor because the workon the megaliths is specialist work, not for everybody. They were also able totransport these heavy stones and erect them, which means they must have had someengineering know-how, and again we didn’t expect that for hunter-gatherers. It’sthe first architecture really, and it’s architecture on a monumental scale.”“So if I understand you correctly, Professor Schmidt, you are saying that we arestanding at the place where both monumental architecture and agriculture wereinvented.”“Yes, that’s right.”“And yet you don’t see anything really revolutionary in this? You see it as aprocess which you can fit comfortably into the existing frame of history?”“Yes. Into existing history. But this process is much more exciting than weexpected. Especially since what we have here at Göbekli Tepe belongs more to theworld of the hunter-gatherers than to the farming societies. It’s toward the endof the hunter-gatherers but not yet the beginning of the Neolithic.”“It’s a time of transition then. A cusp moment. And maybe more than that? WhatI’m getting from our conversation, and from what you’ve showed me of the sitethis morning, is the notion that Göbekli Tepe was a kind of prehistoricthink-tank or a center of innovation, perhaps under the control of some sort ofresident elite. Are you okay with that?”“Yes, yes. It was a place where people came together. People were gathering hereand it was undoubtedly a platform for the distribution of knowledge andinnovation.”“Including knowledge of large-scale stone working and knowledge of agriculture.Would you dare to describe those who controlled the site and disseminated theseideas as a sort of priesthood?”“Whoever they were, they certainly were not practicing simple shamanism. Theywere a bit more like an institution. So, yes, they were on the road to becominga priesthood.”“And since Göbekli Tepe was in unbroken use for well over a thousand years,would this be one continuous culture with its own institutions, with the sameideas and the same ‘priesthood’ who continued to manage the site throughout thatwhole period?”“Yes. But the strange thing is that there was a clear collapse in the effortthat was made as the centuries went by. The truly monumental structures are inthe older layers; in the younger layers they get smaller and there is asignificant decline in quality.”“So the oldest is the best?”“Yes, the oldest is the best.”“And you don’t find that puzzling?”Klaus Schmidt looks almost apologetic. “Well, we hope that eventually we willdiscover even older layers and that there we will see the small beginnings thatwe expect but haven’t yet found. Then we have this monumental phase, and later adecline again.”It occurs to me that “hope” is the operative word in what Professor Schmidt hasjust said. We are used to things starting out small and simple and thenprogressing—evolving—to become ever more complex and sophisticated, so this isnaturally what we expect to find on archaeological sites. It upsets ourcarefully structured ideas of how civilizations should behave, how they shouldmature and develop, when we are confronted by a case like Göbekli Tepe thatstarts out perfect at the beginning and then slowly devolves until it is just apale shadow of its former self.Nor is it so much the process of devolution that we object to. We know thatcivilizations can decay. Just look at the Roman Empire, or the British Empirefor that matter.No, the problem at Göbekli Tepe is the pristine, sudden appearance, like Athenaspringing full-grown and fully armed from the brow of Zeus, of what appears tobe an already seasoned civilization so accomplished that it “invents” bothagriculture and monumental architecture at the apparent moment of its birth.Archaeology can no more explain that than it can explain why the earliestmonuments, art, sculptures, hieroglyphs, mathematics, medicine, astronomy andarchitecture of Ancient Egypt are perfect at the beginning without any traces ofevolution from simple to sophisticated. And we might well ask of Göbekli Tepe,as my friend John Anthony West asks of Ancient Egypt:How does a complex civilization spring full-blown into being. Look at a 1905automobile and compare it to a modern one. There is no mistaking the process of“development.” But in Egypt there are no parallels. Everything is right there atthe start.The answer to the mystery is of course obvious but, because it is repellent tothe prevailing cast of modern thinking, it is seldom considered. Egyptiancivilization was not a “development,” it was a legacy.4[part0108.html#chapter1-4]Could this be the case, also, at Göbekli Tepe?Klaus Schmidt has no time for ideas of a lost civilization that was theprogenitor of all later known civilizations, so when I press him he reiterateshis point that most of Göbekli Tepe remains unexcavated. “As I said,” he growls,somewhat testily, “I expect when we get to the earlier levels we will findevidence of evolution.”He could be right. One of the stunning things about Göbekli Tepi, which hadalready been the subject of eighteen years of continuous excavation when KlausSchmidt showed me round the site in 2013, is that so much of it still remainsunder the ground.But how much?“It’s hard to say,” Schmidt tells me. “We’ve done a geophysicalsurvey—ground-penetrating radar—and from this we can see that at least sixteenfurther large enclosures remain to be excavated.”“Large enclosures?” I ask. I point at the towering megaliths of Enclosure D.“Like this one?”“Yes, like this one. And sixteen is the minimum. In some areas our geophysicalmapping did not give us complete results and we cannot really see inside, but weexpect there are many more than sixteen. Maybe in reality it will turn out to bedouble that number. Maybe even as many as fifty.”“Fifty!”“Yes—fifty of the big enclosures, each enclosure with fourteen or more pillars.But, you know, it’s not our target to excavate everything. Just a little part,because excavation is destruction. We want to keep most of the site untouched.”It dilates the imagination to reflect on the scale of the enterprise undertakenat Göbekli Tepe by the ancients. Not only are the circles of megalithic pillarsalready excavated here at least 6,000 years older than any other knownmegalithic sites anywhere in the world, but also, I now realize, Göbekli Tepe ishuge—occupying an area that might eventually prove to be as much as thirty timeslarger than the fullest extent of a big site like Stonehenge, for example.We are confronted, in other words, by vast, inexplicable antiquity, immensescale, and unknown purpose—and all of it seeming to unfold out of nowhere, withno obvious background or preparation, shrouded utterly in mystery.Enclosures of the giantsI’m used to archaeologists making the sign of the evil eye and turning theirbacks on me when I show up at their excavations. But Professor Schmidt isrefreshingly different. Although he knows very well who I am, he permits me andmy wife, the photographer Santha Faiia, to climb down into Enclosure D andexplore it. All four of the main enclosures so far excavated at Göbekli Tepe arestrictly off limits to the public and under the eye of watchful guards, butthere’s an image on one of the pillars in Enclosure D that I need to take a muchcloser look at than the walkway affords—indeed I can’t even see it from thewalkway—so Schmidt’s generosity of spirit is welcome.We enter the enclosure along a plank which leads to an as yet unexcavatedtwo-meter-high partition of rubble and earth separating the two main centralpillars, one to the east and the other to the west. Quarried from the very hardcrystalline limestone of the region, and polished to a flawlessly smooth finish,these colossal pillars glow mellow gold in the sun. I know from ProfessorSchmidt that they are about 5.5 meters (18 feet) tall and that each of themweighs more than 15 tons.5 [part0108.html#chapter1-5] Scrambling down onto thefloor of the enclosure I note that they stand on stone plinths each about 20centimeters (8 inches) high that have been carved directly out of the livingbedrock. In a row along the front edge of the plinth under the eastern pillar,squatting back on their tails with no wings evident, seven seemingly flightlessbirds have been sculpted in high relief.image [../images/00005.jpeg]Figure 3: Layout of the pillars in Enclosure D at Gobekli Tepe. Pillar 43 is ofthe greatest interest.With their stylized anthropomorphic appearance enhanced by their angled T-shaped“heads” the central pillars loom over me like twin giants. Though they are notmy primary target, I seize the opportunity to examine them closely.Their front edges, representing their chests and bellies, are quite slim—onlyabout twenty centimeters wide—while their flanks measure a bit over a meter(about 4 feet) from front to back. Both figures, as I’d noticed from thewalkway, have arms carved in low relief at their sides, crooked at the elbowsand terminating in hands with long, thin fingers. These fingers wrap round thefronts of the pillars, almost meeting over their “bellies.”Above the hands, covering their “chests” are hints of an open-fronted garment.Just below the hands, both figures also wear a broad belt—again carved in lowrelief—decorated with a distinctive buckle. In both cases what appears to bepart of an animal skin—thought by Schmidt to represent the hind legs and tail ofa fox pelt6 [part0108.html#chapter1-6]—is shown hanging suspended from thebuckle so that it covers the genital region.Both figures also wear necklaces. In the case of the eastern figure the necklaceis decorated with a crescent and disc motif and in the case of the westernfigure with a bull’s head.In addition both pillars stand on their pedestals in exactly the same peculiarway—not securely fixed but resting precariously in slots just 10 centimeters (4inches) deep. Klaus Schmidt and his team have stabilized them with wooden propsand I can only imagine that they must also have been held upright in a similarway in antiquity—unless, perhaps, there was a frame over the enclosure intowhich the heads of the figures were somehow fixed. Since the builders of GöbekliTepe were clearly masters of fashioning, moving and positioning large megaliths,it is mysterious that they chose not to cut deeper slots in which the pillarscould have been securely mounted. There must have been some purpose to this, butI cannot fathom it.So much for the similarities between the two central pillars, but there are alsodifferences. For example, the eastern figure has an almost life-sized depictionof a fox carved in high relief on its right flank so that it appears to beleaping forward from the crook of its elbow. And whereas the belt of the westernpillar is undecorated other than by its buckle, the belt of the eastern pillarbears a number of intriguing adornments including a series of glyphs like theRoman letter “C” and others like the Roman letter “H.” As I study them I reflectthat we cannot possibly know what these symbols meant to the people of GöbekliTepi, from whom we are separated by a vast span of more than eleven thousandyears. It is far-fetched to imagine that they had any kind of writing—let alonewriting in the alphabet we use today! Nonetheless there is something strangelymodern and purposive about the way these pictograms are used and displayed andit seems to me that they are more than merely decorative. Nothing else like themexists anywhere in the world of Upper Palaeolithic art, and the same is true ofthe animal and bird figures. At this early period, such a combination ofmegaliths and sophisticated sculptures is utterly unique and unprecedented.I move on to examine the dozen pillars disposed around the edges of theEnclosure D, which forms more of an ellipse than a strict circle, measuringapproximately 20 meters (65 feet) from west to east and just over 14 meters (46feet) from north to south. The surrounding pillars are generally about half theheight of the central pair and for the most part are not free-standing butrather are embedded into the enclosure wall. Most, though not all, are T-shapedand most are richly decorated with images of birds, insects and animals asthough the cargo of Noah’s Ark has been turned to stone: foxes, gazelles, wildboars, numerous species of birds including several cranes with serpents at theirfeet, many more serpents both individually and in groups, a spider, a wild ass,wild cattle, a lion with its tail curving forward over its spine—and many more.Making the most of our laissez-passer, I take my time but eventually, on thenorthwestern side of the enclosure I come to the pillar I particularly want tosee. For ease of reference Schmidt and his colleagues have numbered all thepillars at Göbekli Tepe and this is “Pillar No. 43.” I know from my priorresearch that it has a large depiction of a scorpion carved in relief on itsbase; some have suggested it might be an image of the zodiacal constellationthat we call Scorpio today.7 [part0108.html#chapter1-7] However, to my greatdisappointment the figure is no longer visible. The archaeologists have coveredit with rubble—to protect it from damage, Schmidt claims. I tell him of myinterest in a possible astronomical connection but he scoffs at this—“There areno astronomical figures here; the zodiac constellations were not recognizeduntil Babylonian times, nine thousand years after Göbekli Tepe”—and he refusespoint-blank to allow me to clear the heaped-up rubble away.I’m about to get into an argument with him—there is in fact excellent evidencethat the zodiac was codified long before Göbekli Tepe8[part0108.html#chapter1-8]—when I notice a group of other figures higher up thesame pillar that have not been covered with rubble. These include a prominentdepiction of a vulture with its wing outstretched in the manner of a human armand with a solid disc poised over that arm-like wing as though being upheld orcradled by it. Another human characteristic of the vulture, quite dissimilar toany examples of this bird that I have ever seen in nature, is that it isportrayed with its “knees” bent forward and with strangely elongated flat feet—abit like some of the cartoon representations of the “Penguin” character in theold Batman comics. It is, in other words, a therianthrope (from the Greektherion, meaning wild beast, and anthropos, meaning man), a hybrid creature—parthuman and part vulture.9 [part0108.html#chapter1-9]Above it are more of the H-shaped pictograms arranged in a row between a seriesof upright and inverted “V” shapes. Again there is a sense of some message, somecommunication here, that is impossible to interpret. Finally, at the top of thepillar, are depictions of what appear to be three large handbags—rectangularcontainers, at any rate, with curved handles. Separating them, positioned overthe front of the handles in each case, are three figures—at the left a bird withlong, human-like legs that mark it out almost certainly as anothertherianthrope, a quadruped with its tail arched forward over its body, and asalamander.image [../images/00006.jpeg]Figure 4: Pillar 43 in Enclosure D. The lower part of the pillar was covered byrubble at the time of my visit, but has been reconstructed here from earlierphotographs (see Plate 7).There is something hauntingly familiar about the whole ensemble, and I feelcertain that I have seen it—or something very like it—somewhere before. The onlyproblem is I can’t remember where or what! I ask Santha to take detailedphotographs of the pillar and when she is done Schmidt suggests that weaccompany him to a different part of the site a few hundred meters to thenorthwest on the other side of the ridge where he and his team have an activeexcavation underway. It’s just one of the dozens of buried enclosures with largepillars that they have identified with ground-penetrating radar, and the firstof these that they are investigating.ParadigmsAs we walk I ask the Professor how and when he became involved with GöbekliTepe. Ironically, given his firm views on the evolution of architecture, itturns out that he got his big break because other archaeologists also had firmviews on the same subject! In 1964 a joint team from the University of Chicagoand the University of Istanbul visited the area with a specific brief to searchout and discover Stone Age sites. However when they saw the top of a largeT-shaped pillar sticking out of the ground, and the remains of other brokenlimestone pillars that had been plowed up by local farmers lying nearby, theydismissed Göbekli Tepe as irrelevant to their interests and moved on elsewhere.The reason?The American and Turkish team had judged the workmanship on the pillars to betoo fine—too advanced, too sophisticated—to have been produced by Stone Agehunter-gatherers. In their opinion, despite the presence of worked flints lyingalongside the limestone fragments, Göbekli Tepe was nothing more than anabandoned medieval cemetery and therefore of no prehistoric interest whatsoever.Their loss was to be Schmidt’s gain. At the end of the 1980s and the beginningof the 1990s he had been involved in another project in Turkey—the excavation ofan early Neolithic site called Nevali Cori which was soon to be flooded by thewaters of the Ataturk Dam. There he and a team of archaeologists from theUniversity of Heidelberg discovered, and rescued from the advancing floodwaters,a number of finely-worked T-shaped limestone pillars that were conclusivelydated to between 8,000 and 9,000 years of age. Some had arms and hands carved inrelief along their sides. “So we recognized that this region had something aboutit that was different from other sites known from this period. Nevali Cori wasour first hint of the existence of large-scale limestone sculptures during thetransition from hunter-gatherer societies to early village farming communities.”A little later, in 1994, Schmidt came across the report of the Turkish-Americansurvey done thirty years earlier and stumbled upon a single paragraph thatmentioned the presence of worked flints alongside fragments of limestone pillarslying on the surface at Göbekli Tepe. “I was a young archaeologist,” heexplains, “I was looking for my own project, and I immediately realized thatthere could be something of significance here, perhaps even another site asimportant as Nevali Cori.”“Which your predecessors had missed, because flints and architectural pillarsare not normally associated in the minds of archaeologists?”I’m hoping he’ll get my hint that he, too, might be missing something at GöbekliTepe because of the established paradigm, but he seems oblivious and replies,“Yes, exactly.”I glance ahead. For the past few moments, as we’ve been walking and talking,we’ve approached a scene of intense activity. I hadn’t been aware of it from thefour main enclosures because it had been concealed from us by the summit of theridge, but now we’ve hiked north over the ridge line and are making our way downthe other side into the new excavation, nominated as Enclosure H, that Schmidthas opened at Göbekli Tepe.10 [part0108.html#chapter1-10] Here five or sixGerman archaeologists are busily at work, some scraping away layers of soil withtrowels or pouring buckets of earth and stones through sieves, others directingthe efforts of a team of thirty Turkish laborers. The focus is on a largerectangular cavity. Perhaps half the size of a football pitch, it’s internallysubdivided by knee-high walls of earth into a dozen or so smaller segments. Fromthe floor of these, at several points, hulking limestone pillars protrude. Mostare T-shaped but my eye is drawn to one that has a smooth curved top, marredonly by a small broken segment, and upon which is carved a particularly finefigure of a male lion. Like the lions in Enclosure D, its long tail sweepsforward over its spine but the workmanship of this piece is of a higher orderthan anything I’ve seen so far today.“That’s a very substantial pillar,” I say to Schmidt. “Can we take a look atit?”He agrees and we pick our way through the excavations until we’re just a coupleof meters from the lion pillar. It’s leaning at an angle against a remnant ofthe rubble of cobble-sized stones and earth that had clearly filled the entireenclosure before the archaeologists began work here. Right at the edge of thissegment of the dig, the head of another pillar can be seen, while in the middleof the segment a deeper trench has been cut—to expose what I guess is the topthird of the lion pillar—and this trench, too, is lined by the same rubble ofcobbles and earth.I ask Schmidt about the rubble. “All those cobbles,” I say. “How did they getthere? They don’t look like the result of natural sedimentation.”“They’re not,” he replies. He’s looking, I think, a little smug. “They were putthere deliberately.”“Deliberately?”“Yes, by the makers of Göbekli Tepe. After the megaliths were put in place, andused for a period of unknown duration, every one of the enclosures wasdeliberately and rapidly buried. For example Enclosure C is the oldest we havefound so far. It appears that it was closed, filled in from top to bottom sothat all the pillars were completely covered, before ‘D,’ the next enclosure inthe sequence, was made. This practice of deliberate infilling has been a greatadvantage to archaeology because it effectively sealed each of the enclosuresand prevented the intrusion of later organic material thus allowing us to beabsolutely certain about the dating.”I’m thinking rapidly as Schmidt talks. The point he makes about dating isinteresting, for at least three reasons.First, the implication is that at megalithic sites around the world where this“sealing” process didn’t happen, the dates archaeologists have arrived at couldbe falsely young as a result of the intrusion of later organic materials (which,by the way, is the only kind of material that is subject to carbon dating;because of course you can’t carbon date inorganic materials like stone).Theoretically this could mean that famous megalithic sites that were notdeliberately buried by their builders (the temples of Malta, for example, or thetaulas of Menorca, or the stone circles of Avebury and Stonehenge in England)could turn out to be much older than we are presently taught.Secondly, if the bulk of the dates at Göbekli Tepe are derived from organicmaterials in the fill—a fact that I’m later able to confirm from Schmidt’spublished papers11 [part0108.html#chapter1-11]—then this tells us only about theage of the fill; the megalithic pillars themselves must be at least that old,but they could be older since they stood in place before being buried, for “aperiod of unknown duration.”Thirdly, and perhaps most important, why was the site infilled? What couldpossibly be the motive for going to all this trouble to create a series ofspectacular megalithic circles only to end up deliberately burying them sothoroughly and so efficiently that more than 10,000 years would pass before theywere found again?The first thought that comes to my mind is … time capsule—that Göbekli Tepe wascreated to transmit a message of some kind to the future and buried so that itsmessage could be kept intact and hidden for millennia. It’s a thought that willreturn to haunt me many times as I continue my investigation, but another fullyear will pass before it comes to fruition, as we’ll see in later chapters.Meanwhile, when I put the question to Klaus Schmidt he offers a completelydifferent explanation for the deliberate burial of the circles of pillars.“In my opinion this was their program,” he says. “They made the enclosures to beburied.”“Made to be buried?” I’m intrigued. I’m waiting for him to say “as a timecapsule” but instead he replies, “Like, for example, the megalithic cemeteriesin Western Europe—huge constructions and then a mound on top.”“But then they’re for burial of bodies. Is there any evidence of burial ofbodies here?”“We don’t have burials yet. We have some fragments of human bones mixed in withanimal bones within the filling material but no burials at the moment. We expectwe will find some soon.”“So you believe Göbekli Tepe was a necropolis?”“It still has to be proved. But that’s my hypothesis, yes.”“And those fragments of human bones you’ve found mixed with animal bones ininfill. What do you make of those? Sacrifice? Cannibalism?”“I don’t think so. My guess is that those bones are evidence of some specialtreatment of the human body after death—perhaps deliberate excarnation. Suchrites were practiced at a number of other known sites in this region that are ofabout the same age. For me the presence of human bones in the filling materialstrengthens the hypothesis that we will find primary burials somewhere atGöbekli Tepe, burials that were opened after some time for a continuation ofvery specific rituals performed with the dead.”12 [part0108.html#chapter1-12]“What, then, was the function of the pillars?”“The T-shaped pillars are certainly anthropomorphic, yet often with animalsdepicted on them, perhaps telling us stories connected with the T-shaped beings.We cannot be sure, of course, but I think they represent divine beings.”“And even when they’re not T-shaped?” I point to the lion pillar. “Like thisone? It too has an animal depicted upon it.”Schmidt shrugs. “We cannot know for sure. Perhaps we will never know. There isso much mystery here. We could excavate for fifty years and still not find allthe answers. We are just at the beginning.”“But even so you do have some answers. You clearly have some ideas. This lionpillar, for example. Are you at least able to say how old it is?”“Honestly we don’t know. When we excavate beneath it we will hopefully find someorganic material that we can carbon date. But until we do we can’t be sure.”“But what’s your impression from the style?”Schmidt shrugs again before conceding, a little begrudgingly, “It looks similarto some of the pillars in Enclosure C.”“Which are the oldest?”“Yes—so something of that age.”“And that would be what exactly?”“Exactly 9600 BC, calibrated, is the earliest date we have.”Radiocarbon years and calendar years drift further and further apart as timegoes by because the amount of the radioactive isotope carbon-14 in theatmosphere and in all living, organic, things varies from epoch to epoch.Fortunately scientists have found ways—too complicated to go into at thispoint—to correct for such fluctuations. The process is called calibration sowhen Schmidt says “9600 BC calibrated” he is giving me calendar years. What“9600 BC calibrated” means in 2013 when I’m talking to him is therefore 9600years plus the 2013 years that have elapsed since the time of Christ—i.e. 11,613years ago. I am writing this sentence in December 2014 and you might not read ituntil 2016, by which time that oldest date that Schmidt is referring to willwork out at 11,616 years before the present.You get the idea.In other words, put simply, and in round numbers, the oldest parts of GöbekliTepe to have been excavated so far are a little over 11,600 years old. And,despite all the cautions and qualifications he has expressed, what Schmidt istelling me is that in his informed opinion, on stylistic grounds, thelion-pillar we are looking at is likely to be at least as old as anythinghitherto excavated at Göbekli Tepe.Indeed, although he hasn’t said so much—there’s very little evidence one way orthe other—the possibility has to be considered that it might even be older.After all, he’s already admitted that the best work at Göbekli Tepe is theoldest. It’s troubling, therefore, despite the hope he’s expressed that furtherexcavation will reveal “the small beginnings that we expect but haven’t yetfound,” that this first piece of further excavation has in fact uncovered nosuch “small beginnings.” On the contrary what it has brought to light is amassive, superbly executed megalithic pillar, with a lion rampant carved upon itin exquisite high relief, that appears, at least on stylistic grounds, to beextremely old.Perhaps, rather than Schmidt’s hoped-for “small beginnings,” further excavationswill only uncover more of the same?“We know the end,” the Professor tells me firmly. “The youngest layers atGöbekli Tepe date to 8200 BC. That’s when the site is abandoned forever. But wedon’t know the beginning yet.”“Except that date of 9600 BC, 11,600 years ago, that you have from Enclosure C.That’s the beginning—at least as far as you’ve been able to establish it up tonow?”“The beginning of the monumental phase, yes.” There’s a glint in the Professor’seye. “And you know, 9600 BC is an important date. It isn’t just a number. It’sthe end of the Ice Age. It’s a global phenomenon. So since this goes inparallel—”The date Schmidt is putting such emphasis on rings a sudden bell in my mind,relating to other research I’ve been doing, and I feel compelled to interrupt.“9600 BC! That’s not just the end of the Ice Age. It’s the end of the YoungerDryas cold spell that starts in, what—10,800 BC?”“And ends in 9620 BC,” Schmidt continues, “according to the ice cores fromGreenland. So how likely is it to be an accident that the monumental phase atGöbekli Tepe starts in 9600 BC when the climate of the whole world has taken asudden turn for the better and there’s an explosion in nature and inpossibilities?”I can only agree. It doesn’t seem likely that it’s an accident at all. On thecontrary, I feel certain there must be a connection. We’ll explore thatconnection, and the mysterious cataclysmic period that geologists call theYounger Dryas—and what those Greenland ice cores tell us—in Part II.Meanwhile, back in 2013, I close my interview with Klaus Schmidt with somepraise. And in December 2014, as I sit at my desk going through the transcriptof the recording I made at Göbekli Tepe, and knowing that Klaus died of amassive, unexpected heart attack on July 20, 2014, I’m glad I did so. “You’re avery humble man,” I say. “But the fact is you’ve discovered a site that hascaused us all to rethink our ideas of the past. This is a remarkable thing and Ibelieve that your name, as well as the name of Göbekli Tepe, will go down inhistory.”The bringers of civilizationAfter leaving Göbekli Tepe in mid-September 2013, I make an extensive journeythroughout the length and breadth of Turkey before I finally return home.The lion pillar sticks in my mind, but what particularly haunts me is the sceneon Pillar No. 43 in Enclosure D—the scene showing the vulture with its benthuman-like knees, and its wing that so much resembles an arm, holding up a soliddisc.I download Santha’s photographs onto my computer and call up that scene. It hasmany remarkable elements as well as the disc. Both wings of the vulture areshown, I now realize, the other stretched out behind its body. To the right ofthe vulture is a serpent. It has a large triangular head, as do all serpentsdepicted at Göbekli Tepe, and its body is coiled into a curve with its tailextending down toward an “H”-shaped pictogram. The serpent is nestled close toanother large bird—not a vulture but something more like an Ibis with a long,sickle-shaped beak. Between it and the vulture is yet another bird, again with ahooked beak, but smaller, with the look of a chick.I turn my attention to the disc. I don’t know what to make of it, but theobvious guess from its shape is that it’s meant to represent the sun.There’s something else that interests me more, however, if I can just put myfinger on what it is—something evocative, something hauntingly familiar, aboutthe imagery on this ancient pillar from Göbekli Tepe. Santha has shot hundredsof frames of it, from every possible angle, and obsessively I keep going throughthem, hoping for some clue. The vulture … the disc … and in the next registerabove the vulture, that weird row of bags, with their curved handles …Bags.Handbags.Suddenly I get it. I go to the shelf in my library where I keep reference copiesof my own books, pull out Fingerprints of the Gods, and start leafing throughthe photo sections. The first section deals with South America and what I’mlooking for isn’t there. But the second section is devoted to Mexico and, on thefifth page, I find it. It’s image number 33 with the caption: “Man in Serpentsculpture from the Olmec site of La Venta.” It’s Santha’s photograph, taken wayback in 1992 or 1993, of an impressive relief carved on a slab of solid granitemeasuring about 1.2 meters (4 feet) wide and 1.5 meters (5 feet) high. Therelief features what is believed to be the earliest representation of theCentral American deity whom the Maya (a later civilization than the Olmecs)would call Kukulkan or Gucumatz, and who was known by the even later Aztecs asQuetzalcoatl.13 [part0108.html#chapter1-13] All three names mean “FeatheredSerpent” (sometimes translated as “Plumed Serpent”) and it is such a serpent,decorated with a prominent feathered crest on its head, that we see here. Itspowerful body coils sinuously around the outer edge of the relief, cradling thefigure of a man who is depicted in a seated position as though he is reachingfor pedals with his feet. In his right hand he is holding what I described atthe time as “a small, bucket-shaped object.”14 [part0108.html#chapter1-14]image [../images/00007.jpeg]Figure 5: “Man in Serpent” sculpture—the earliest surviving representation ofthe Central American deity later known as Quetzalcoatl.I return to Santha’s images from Enclosure D at Göbekli Tepe and am immediatelyable to confirm what I suspected. The three bags on the pillar closely resemblethe “bucket-shaped” object from La Venta in Mexico. The same curved handle isthere in both cases and the profile of the “bags” and of the “bucket”—slightlywider at the bottom than at the top—is also very similar.If that were all there was to it, this would surely be a coincidence. The “Manin Serpent” relief from La Venta is thought by archaeologists to date to theperiod between the tenth and the sixth centuries BC15[part0108.html#chapter1-15]—about nine thousand years younger than the imageryfrom Göbekli Tepe—so how could there possibly be a connection?That’s when I remember a second curious image I reproduced in Fingerprints ofthe Gods. I check the index for the name Oannes, turn to Chapter Eleven, andfind another figure of a man carrying a bag or bucket. I hadn’t noticed theresemblance between it and “Man in Serpent” before but it’s obvious to me now.Although not absolutely identical, both bags have the same curved handle that isalso depicted on the Göbekli Tepe pillar. Quickly I scan through the report Iwrote twenty years earlier. Oannes was a civilizing hero revered by all theancient cultures of Mesopotamia. He was said to have appeared there in theremotest antiquity and to have taught the inhabitants:the skills necessary for writing and for doing mathematics and for all sorts ofknowledge: how to build cities, found temples … make laws … determine bordersand divide land, also how to plant seeds and then to harvest their fruits andvegetables. In short [he] taught men all those things conducive to a civilizedlife.16 [part0108.html#chapter1-16]The fullest account we have of Oannes is found in surviving fragments of theworks of a Babylonian priest called Berossos who wrote in the third century BC.Fortunately I have a translation of all the Berossos fragments in one volume inmy library so I dig it out along with a few other sources on ancientMesopotamian myths and traditions. It doesn’t take me long to discover thatOannes did not do his work alone but was supposedly the leader of a group ofbeings known as the Seven Apkallu—the “Seven Sages”—who were said to have lived“before the flood” (a cataclysmic global deluge features prominently in manyMesopotamian traditions, including those of Sumer, Akkad, Assyria and Babylon).Alongside Oannes, these sages are portrayed as bringers of civilization who, inthe most ancient past, gave humanity a moral code, arts, crafts and agricultureand taught them architectural, building and engineering skills.17[part0108.html#chapter1-17]image [../images/00008.jpeg]Figure 6: Oannes, a civilizing hero from before the flood, revered by all theancient cultures of Mesopotamia. The reasons for his strange clothing orcostume—he is often referred to as a “fish-garbed figure”—are given in Chapter8.That’s a list, I can’t help thinking, that includes all the skills supposedly“invented” at Göbekli Tepe!I call up a map on my computer screen and see that not only does southeasternTurkey adjoin Mesopotamia geographically but also that the two areas are linkedin an even more intimate and direct way. Largely occupied today by the modernstate of Iraq, the ancient name Mesopotamia means, literally, “[land] betweenrivers”—the rivers in question being the Tigris and the Euphrates, which reachthe sea in the Persian Gulf, but which both have their headwaters in the sameTaurus mountain range of southeastern Turkey where Göbekli Tepe is situated.image [../images/00009.jpeg]Figure 7: Location of Gobekli Tepe in relation to the headwaters of the Tigrisand Euphrates rivers of MesopotamiaWhile I’m online I run some searches for images of the Seven Sages. I don’t getmany hits at first, but the moment I change the search terms to “Apkallu” and“Seven Apkallu” I open a colossal archive of images from all over the internet,many of them reliefs from Assyria, a culture that thrived in Mesopotamia fromapproximately 2500 BC to about 600 BC. I add “Assyrian Apkallu” to the searchparameters and even more images flood my screen. Often they show bearded menholding bags or buckets which closely resemble those depicted on the GöbekliTepe pillar and the one held by the Mexican “Man in Serpent” figure. It’s notjust the curved handles of these containers, or their shape—where theresemblance is much closer than on the original Oannes relief I reproduced inFingerprints of the Gods. Even more striking is the peculiar and distinctive waythat the figures from both Mesopotamia and Mexico hold these containers with thefingers of the hands turned inward and the thumb crooked forward over thehandle.There’s something else as well. A good number of the images show not a man but atherianthrope—a birdman with a hooked beak exactly like the hooked beak of thetherianthrope on the Göbekli Tepe pillar. What makes the resemblance even closeris that in the Mesopotamian reliefs the birdman is holding the container in onehand and a cone-shaped object in the other. The shape is a little different buta comparison with the disc cradled above the wing of the Göbekli Tepe birdman ishard to resist.I can’t prove anything yet. It could, of course, all be coincidence, or I couldbe imagining links that aren’t there. But my curiosity is aroused by the similarcontainers on different continents and in different epochs and so I jot down aseries of questions that can form the frame of a loose hypothesis for futuretesting. For instance, could these containers (whether they are bags or buckets)be the symbols of office of an initiatic brotherhood—far traveled and deeplyancient, with roots reaching back into the remotest prehistory? I feel that thispossibility, extraordinary though it may seem on the face of things, is worthlooking into and is strengthened by the distinctive hand postures. Might thesenot have served the same sort of function as Masonic handshakes today—providingan instant means of identifying who is an “insider” and who is not?image [../images/00010.jpeg]Figure 8: Representations of Oannes and the Apkallu in Mesopotamian art andsculpture where they are frequently depicted as composite fish-man or bird-manfigures.And what might have been the purpose of such a brotherhood?Curiously enough, in both Mexico and Mesopotamia where myths and traditions havesurvived in connection with the imagery and symbolism, we are left in no doubtas to what the purpose was. Stated simply it was to teach, to guide and tospread the benefits of civilization.This, after all, was the explicit function of Oannes and the Apkallu sages whotaught the inhabitants of Mesopotamia “how to plant seeds and then to harvesttheir fruits and vegetables”—agriculture in other words—and who also taught themarchitectural and engineering skills, notably the building of temples. If theyneeded to be taught these things then they must have had no knowledge of thembefore the arrival of the sages. They must, in other words, have been nomadichunter-gatherers just as the inhabitants of southeastern Turkey were until thesudden and surprising entry onto the world stage of Göbekli Tepe.The same, it transpires, was believed to be the case with the ancientinhabitants of Mexico before the arrival of Quetzalcoatl, the Feathered Serpent,who came to teach them the benefits of settled agriculture and the skillsnecessary to build temples. Although this deity is frequently depicted as aserpent, he is more often shown in human form—the serpent being his symbol andhis alter ego—and is usually described as “a tall bearded white man”18[part0108.html#chapter1-18] … “a mysterious person … a white man with a strongformation of body, broad forehead, large eyes and a flowing beard.”19[part0108.html#chapter1-19] Indeed, as Sylvanus Griswold Morley, the doyen ofMayan studies, concluded, the attributes and life history of Quetzalcoatl:are so human that it is not improbable that he may have been an actualhistorical character … the memory of whose benefactions lingered after hisdeath, and whose personality was eventually deified.20[part0108.html#chapter1-20]The same could very well be said of Oannes—and just like Oannes at the head ofthe Apkallu (likewise depicted as prominently bearded) it seems thatQuetzalcoatl traveled with his own brotherhood of sages and magicians. We learnthat they arrived in Mexico “from across the sea in a boat that moved by itselfwithout paddles,”21 [part0108.html#chapter1-21] and that Quetzalcoatl wasregarded as having been “the founder of cities, the framer of laws and theteacher of the calendar.”22 [part0108.html#chapter1-22] The sixteenth centurySpanish chronicler, Bernardino de Sahagun, who was fluent in the language of theAztecs and took great care to record their ancient traditions accurately, tellsus further that:Quetzalcoatl was a great civilizing agent who entered Mexico at the head of aband of strangers. He imported the arts into the country and especially fosteredagriculture … He built spacious and elegant houses, and inculcated a type ofreligion which fostered peace.23 [part0108.html#chapter1-23]So, in summary, as well as a complex pattern of shared symbols and iconography,Quetzalcoatl and Oannes shared the same civilizing mission, which they deliveredin widely separated regions of the world in an epoch that is always described asbeing very far back in time—remote, antediluvian and hoary with age.Could it have been as far back as 9600 BC—the epoch of Göbekli Tepe where manyof the same symbols are found and where, although we have no surviving legends,the signs of a civilizing mission in the form of the sudden appearance ofagriculture and monumental architecture are everywhere to be seen?The implications, should I ever be able to prove this hypothesis, are stunning.At the very least it would mean that some as yet unknown and unidentified peoplesomewhere in the world had already mastered all the arts and attributes of ahigh civilization more than twelve thousand years ago in the depths of the lastIce Age and had sent out emissaries around the world to spread the benefits oftheir knowledge. Who might these shadowy emissaries have been, these sages,these “Magicians of the Gods” as I was already beginning to think of them? Andwhy was there this insistent connection to the date of 9600 BC?For as Klaus Schmidt rightly pointed out as he showed me round Göbekli Tepeunder the baking sun of the Taurus Mountains, 9600 BC is indeed “an importantdate”—important not only because it marks the end of the Ice Age but foranother, rather surprising reason as well.The Greek lawmaker Solon visited Egypt in 600 BC and there he was told a veryextraordinary story by the priests at the Temple of Sais in the Nile Delta—astory that was eventually handed down to his more famous descendant Plato, whoin due course shared it with the world in his Dialogues of Timaeus and Critias.It is, of course, the story of the great lost civilization called Atlantisswallowed up by flood and earthquake in a single terrible day and night ninethousand years before the time of Solon.24 [part0108.html#chapter1-24]Or, in our calendar, in 9600 BC."},{"pageContent":" Chapter 2 [part0131.html#c_ch2]The Mountain of Light [part0131.html#c_ch2]“Everything we’ve been taught about the origins of civilization may be wrong,”says Danny Hilman Natawidjaja, PhD, senior geologist with the Research Centerfor Geotechnology at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences. “Old stories aboutAtlantis and other great lost civilizations of prehistory, long dismissed asmyths by archaeologists, look set to be proved true.”It’s December 2013. We’re in Cianjur Regency, about 900 meters (2,950 feet)above sea level and 70 kilometers (43 miles) west of the city of Bandung on theisland of Java, Indonesia. I’m climbing with Dr. Natawidjaja up the steep slopeof a 110 meter (360 feet) high step-pyramid set amidst a magical landscape ofvolcanoes, mountains and jungles interspersed with paddy fields and teaplantations.image [../images/00011.jpeg]Figure 9: Artist’s impression of ancient Gunung Padang. (Courtesy of Pon S.Purajatnika)In 1914, lying scattered among the dense trees and undergrowth that then coveredthe summit of the pyramid, ancient man-made structures formed from blocks ofcolumnar basalt were first shown to archaeologists. Local people held the siteto be sacred and called it Gunung Padang, the name it still goes by today, oftenmistranslated as “Mountain Field” by those unaware that the language of thisarea is not Indonesian but Sundanese—in which Gunung Padang means “Mountain ofLight,” or “Mountain of Enlightenment.” The structures were found to be arrangedacross five terraces with a combined area of about 150 meters (492 feet) long by40 meters (131 feet) wide. The visiting archaeologists were told that theterraces had been used as a place of meditation and retreat since timeimmemorial—and again this remains true today.However, neither the archaeologists, nor apparently the locals realized thepyramid was a pyramid. It was believed to be a natural hill, somewhat modifiedby human activity, until Natawidjaja and his team began a geophysical surveyhere in 2011 using ground-penetrating radar, electrical resistivity and seismictomography. By then the summit had long since been cleared and the structures onthe terraces recognized as works of megalithic architecture. But no radiocarbondating had yet been done and the age attributed to the site—about 1000 BC—wasbased on guesswork rather than on excavations.The first scientific radiocarbon dating was done by Natawidjaja himself onorganic materials in soils underlying the megaliths at or near the surface. Thedates produced—around 500 to 1500 BC—were close enough to the archaeologicalguesswork to cause no controversy. But a surprise was in store as Natawidjajaand his team extended their investigation using tubular drills that brought upcores of earth and stone from much deeper levels.First, the drill cores contained evidence—fragments of worked columnarbasalt—that more man-made megalithic structures lay far beneath the surface.Secondly, the organic materials brought up in the drill cores began to yieldolder and older dates—3000 BC to 5000 BC, then 9600 BC as the drills bit deeper,then around 11,000 BC, then 15,000 BC and finally, at depths of 27.5 meters (90feet) and more, an astonishing sequence of dates of 20,000 BC to 22,000 BC andearlier.“This was not at all what my colleagues in the world of archaeology expected orwanted to hear,” says Natawidjaja, a world-renowned expert in the geology ofmegathrust earthquakes who earned his PhD at Cal Tech in the United States andwho, it becomes apparent, regards archaeology as a thoroughly unscientificdiscipline.A truly cataclysmic period …The problem is that those dates going back before 9600 BC take us deep into thelast Ice Age, when Indonesia was not a series of islands as it is today but waspart of a vast antediluvian Southeast Asian continent dubbed “Sundaland” bygeologists.Sea level was 122 meters (400 feet) lower then. Huge ice caps 3.2 kilometers (2miles) deep covered most of Europe and North America until the ice caps began tomelt. Then all the water stored in them returned to the oceans and sea-levelrose, submerging many parts of the world where humans had previously lived. ThusBritain was joined to Europe during the Ice Age (there was no English Channel orNorth Sea). Likewise there was no Red Sea, no Persian Gulf, Sri Lanka was joinedto southern India, Siberia was joined to Alaska, Australia was joined to NewGuinea—and so on and so forth. It was during this epoch of sea-level rise,sometimes slow and continuous, sometimes rapid and cataclysmic, that the Ice Agecontinent of Sundaland was submerged with only the Malaysian Peninsula and theIndonesian islands as we know them today high enough to remain above water.image [../images/00012.jpeg]Figure 10image [../images/00013.jpeg]Figure 11: The flooding of Sundaland at the end of the last Ice Age.As we saw in the last chapter, the established archaeological view of the stateof human civilization until the end of the last Ice Age is that our ancestorswere primitive hunter-gatherers, ignorant of agriculture and incapable of anyarchitectural feats bigger than wigwams and bivouacs.This is why Göbekli Tepe in southeastern Turkey is so significant—because itbreaks that paradigm wide open and cries out for serious consideration of apossibility, previously relegated to the lunatic fringe, that civilization mightbe much older and more mysterious than we thought.1 [part0109.html#chapter2-1]With the date of its foundation presently set at 9600 BC (“exactly 9600 BC” asKlaus Schmidt was at pains to point out to me), Göbekli Tepe also requires us toreopen the cold case of Atlantis which archaeologists have long ridiculed,pouring scorn and derision on anyone daring to utter the much reviled “A” word.As noted at the end of the last chapter, the Greek philosopher Plato, whosedialogues Timaeus and Critias contain the earliest surviving mention of thefabled sunken kingdom, sets the catastrophic destruction and submergence ofAtlantis by floods and earthquakes at 9,000 years before the time of Solon2[part0109.html#chapter2-2]—i.e. at exactly 9600 BC. The Greeks could not haveknown of Göbekli Tepe (let alone that it was mysteriously founded at the verymoment Atlantis was said to have died). Moreover they had no access to theGreenland ice cores dating the end of the Ice Age to 9620 BC, just twenty yearsbefore the foundation of Göbekli Tepe, nor to modern scientific knowledge aboutthe rapidly rising sea levels (often accompanied by cataclysmic earthquakes asthe weight of the melting ice caps was removed from the continental landmasses)that occurred in this period. With all this in mind, therefore, the date Platogives is, to say the least, an uncanny coincidence.In Danny Natawidjaja’s view, however, it is no coincidence at all. His researchat Gunung Padang has convinced him that Plato was right about the existence of ahigh civilization in the depths of the last Ice Age—a civilization that wasindeed brought to a cataclysmic end involving floods and earthquakes in an epochof great global instability between 10,800 BC and 9600 BC.This epoch, which geologists call the “Younger Dryas,” has long been recognizedas mysterious and tumultuous. In 10,800 BC, when it began, the earth had beenemerging from the Ice Age for roughly 10,000 years, global temperatures wererising steadily and the ice caps were melting. Then there was a sudden dramaticreturn to colder conditions—nearly as cold as at the peak of the Ice Age 21,000years ago. This short, sharp deep freeze lasted for 1,200 years until 9600 BCwhen the warming trend resumed, global temperatures shot up again and theremaining ice caps melted very suddenly, dumping all the water they containedinto the oceans.image [../images/00014.jpeg]Figure 12: All of human history as it is presently taught to us follows theYounger Dryas—the mysterious cataclysmic period between 10,800 BC (around 12,800years ago) and 9,600 BC (around 11,600 years ago).“It is difficult,” Natawidjaja says, “for us to imagine what life on earth musthave been like during the Younger Dryas. It was a truly cataclysmic period ofimmense climate instability and terrible, indeed terrifying, global conditions.It’s not surprising that many large animal species, such as the mammoths, wentextinct during this precise time and of course it had huge effects on ourancestors—not just those ‘primitive’ hunter-gatherers the archaeologists speakof but also, I believe, a high civilization that was wiped from the historicalrecord by the upheavals of the Younger Dryas.”A controversial pyramidWhat has brought Natawidjaja to this radical view is the evidence he and histeam have uncovered at Gunung Padang. When their drill cores began to yield veryancient carbon dates from organic materials embedded in clays filling the gapsbetween worked stones, they expanded their investigation using geophysicalequipment—ground-penetrating radar, seismic tomography and electricalresistivity—to get a picture of what lay under the ground. The results werestunning, showing layers of massive construction using the same megalithicelements of columnar basalt that are found on the surface but with courses ofhuge basaltic rocks beneath them extending down to thirty meters (100 feet) andmore beneath the surface. At those depths the carbon dates indicate that themegaliths were put in place more than 12,000 years ago and in some cases as farback as 24,000 years ago.Columnar basalt does form naturally—the famous Giant’s Causeway in NorthernIreland is an example—but at Gunung Padang it has been used as a buildingmaterial and is laid out in a form never found in nature.“The geophysical evidence is unambiguous,” Natawidjaja says. “Gunung Padang isnot a natural hill but a man-made pyramid and the origins of construction herego back long before the end of the last Ice Age. Since the work is massive evenat the deepest levels, and bears witness to the kinds of sophisticatedconstruction skills that were deployed to build the pyramids of Egypt, or thelargest megalithic sites of Europe, I can only conclude that we’re looking atthe work of a lost civilization and a fairly advanced one.”“The archaeologists won’t like that,” I point out.“They don’t!” Natawidjaja agrees with a rueful smile. “I’ve already got myselfinto a lot of hot water with this. My case is a solid one, based on goodscientific evidence, but it’s not an easy one. I’m up against deeply entrenchedbeliefs.”The next step will be a full-scale archaeological excavation. “We have toexcavate in order to interrogate our remote sensing data and our carbon datingsequences and either confirm or deny what we believe we’ve found here,” saysNatawidjaja, “but unfortunately there’s a lot of obstacles in our way.”When I ask what he means by obstacles he replies that some senior Indonesianarchaeologists are lobbying the government in Jakarta to prevent him from doingany further work at Gunung Padang on the grounds that they “know” the site isless than three thousand years old and see no justification for disturbing it.“I don’t deny that the megaliths at the surface are less than three thousandyears old,” Natawidjaja hastens to add, “but I suggest they were put herebecause Gunung Padang has been recognized as a sacred place since timeimmemorial. It’s the deepest layers of the structure at between 12,000 and morethan 20,000 years old that are the most important. They have potentiallyrevolutionary implications for our understanding of history and I think it’svital that we be allowed to investigate them properly.”AtlantisHappily, there was a decisive Presidential intervention during 2014 and I cannow report that Danny (I’ll use his first name henceforth as we have becomefriends) was given carte blanche to excavate the site. He and his team beganwork in August 2014, completing a short season there between August and October,but as the experience at Göbekli Tepe shows, painstaking, detailed archaeologyis a slow process and they do not expect to reach the deepest layers until 2017or 2018. As the first season neared its end, however, Danny emailed me anupdate:The research progress has been great. We have excavated three more spots righton top of the megalithic site in the past couple of weeks, which give moreevidence and details about the buried structures. We have uncovered lots morestone artifacts from the excavations. The existence of the pyramid-likestructure beneath the megalithic site is now loud and clear; even fornon-specialists, it is not too difficult to understand if they come and see forthemselves. We have found some kind of open hall buried by soil five to sevenmeters thick; however we have not yet got into the main chamber. We are nowdrilling to the suspected location of the chamber (based on subsurfacegeophysic) in the middle of the megalithic site.3 [part0109.html#chapter2-3]Buried structures? Chambers? Ah, yes, I forgot to mention those. We’ll go intothe implications of all this in more detail in a later chapter, but in brief,the geophysical survey work that Danny and his team did between 2011 and 2013,deploying the latest technologies in electrical resistivity, seismic tomography,ground-penetrating radar and core drilling, revealed not only deeply buriedmassive constructions and very ancient carbon dates at Gunung Padang but alsothe presence of three further hidden and as yet unexcavated chambers, sorectilinear in form that they are most unlikely to be natural. The largest ofthese lies at a depth of between 21.3 and 27.4 meters (70 to 90 feet) andmeasures approximately 5.5 meters (18 feet) high, 13.7 meters (45 feet) long and9.1 meters (30 feet) wide.Could it be the fabled “Hall of Records” of Atlantis? Danny has put hisimpeccable scientific credentials on the line with the controversial claim thatit might be. Not only does he refuse to scoff at the idea of Atlantis but alsohe’s written a book arguing that Indonesia—or rather the huge areas of ancient“Sundaland” that were drowned by rising sea levels at the end of the IceAge—might actually be Atlantis.4 [part0109.html#chapter2-4]Danny and I made an extensive research trip around the whole of the Indonesianarchipelago in June 2014 searching out megalithic sites off the beaten trackthat have never been properly studied by archaeologists. In Chapter EighteenI’ll describe our findings, and how they relate to the Gunung Padang mystery,but meanwhile I want to report here on the opinion of Dr. Robert Schoch,Professor of Geology at Boston University, who was with me in December 2013 whenI first met Danny at Gunung Padang.5 [part0109.html#chapter2-5]The view of Professor Robert SchochSchoch is a renowned figure, indeed notorious, for the case he’s made, based onstrict geological evidence, that the Great Sphinx of Giza bears the unmistakableerosion patterns of thousands of years of heavy rainfall.6[part0109.html#chapter2-6] This means it has to be much older than 2500 BC (theorthodox date, when Egypt received no more rain than it does today) and mustoriginally have been carved around the end of the Ice Age when the Nile valleywas subjected to a long period of intense precipitation.A tall, rangy, scholarly man with a full beard and a mop of unruly hair, Schochwas in his element at Gunung Padang carefully interrogating the results of thegeophysical scans with Danny, collecting samples and minutely examining thesite. Afterward, when he’d returned to the US and had time to analyze the data,he wrote:The first important observation is that … Gunung Padang goes back to before theend of the last Ice Age, circa 9700 BC. Based on the evidence, I believe thathuman use of the site began by circa 14,700 BC. Possibly the earliest use of thesite goes back to 22,000 BC, or even earlier.In my assessment, Layer Three, some 4 to 10 meters (13.1 to 32.8 feet) or sobelow the surface, includes the period of the very end of the last Ice Age,circa 10,000 to 9500 BC, when major climatic changes took place, with dramaticglobal warming, rising sea levels, torrential rains, increased earthquake andvolcanic activity, widespread wildfires … and other catastrophes occurringacross the surface of earth … There is evidence of collapsed structures in LayerThree, possibly the result of the tumultuous conditions at that time.Visiting Gunung Padang, pondering the dates and evidence of collapse andrebuilding that may have occurred here, I could not help but think about anothermajor site—representing very ancient civilization—that spans the end of the lastIce Age, namely Göbekli Tepe in southeastern Turkey … I also think of Egypt andmy own work on re-dating the Great Sphinx. The extreme weathering and erosionseen on the proto-Sphinx (the head was re-carved and the monument reused duringdynastic times), caused by torrential rains, could have been a result of theextreme climatic changes at the end of the last Ice Age.Putting together the evidence of Gunung Padang with that derived from GöbekliTepe, the Sphinx of Egypt, and other sites and lines of data from around theworld, I believe we are coming closer to understanding the cataclysmic times andevents at the end of the last Ice Age. Genuine civilizations of a sophisticatednature existed prior to circa 9700 BCE, which were devastated by the events thatbrought the last Ice Age to a close.7 [part0109.html#chapter2-7]Looking for the smoking gun …At six thousand or more years older than the stone circles of Stonehenge, themegaliths of Göbekli Tepe, like the deeply buried megaliths of Gunung Padang,mean that the timeline of history taught in our schools and universities for thebest part of the last hundred years can no longer stand. It is beginning to lookas though civilization, as I argued in my controversial 1995 bestsellerFingerprints of the Gods, is indeed much older and much more mysterious than wethought.In essence what I proposed in that book was that an advanced civilization hadbeen wiped out and lost to history in a global cataclysm at the end of the lastIce Age. I suggested there were survivors who settled at various locationsaround the world and attempted to pass on their superior knowledge, includingknowledge of agriculture and architecture, to hunter-gatherer peoples who hadalso survived the cataclysm. Indeed even today we have populations ofhunter-gatherers, in the Kalahari Desert, for instance, and in the Amazonjungle, who co-exist with our advanced technological culture—so we should not besurprised that equally disparate levels of civilization might have co-existed inthe past.What I could not do when I wrote Fingerprints, because the data was not thenavailable, was identify the exact nature of the cataclysm that had wiped out myhypothetical lost civilization. Instead I speculated on a number of possiblecauses, notably the radical “earth crust displacement” theory of ProfessorCharles Hapgood which, though endorsed by Albert Einstein,8[part0109.html#chapter2-8] has since found little favor among geologists. Thisabsence of a credible “smoking gun” was one of the many aspects of my argumentthat was heavily criticized by archaeologists. Since 2007, however, a cascade ofscientific evidence has come to light that has identified the smoking gun forme. It’s all the more intriguing because it’s the work of a large group ofimpressively credentialed mainstream scientists, and because it does not ruleout, indeed it in some ways reinforces, the case for massive crustal instabilitythat I made in Fingerprints of the Gods.We’ll explore this new evidence, and its stunning implications, in the followingchapters."},{"pageContent":" Part II [part0131.html#c_part2]Comet [part0131.html#c_part2]"},{"pageContent":" Chapter 3 [part0131.html#c_ch3]A Wall of Green Water Destroying Everything in Its Path … [part0131.html#c_ch3]Could certain ancient myths and traditions, judged to be of no historic value byscholars, in fact encode accurate recollections of an epoch when humanityexperienced a crisis so devastating, so cataclysmic and so dislocating that welost our memory of our true past? Consider this account from the Ojibwa, aNative American people:The star with the long, wide tail is going to destroy the world some day when itcomes low again. That’s the comet called Long-Tailed Heavenly Climbing Star. Itcame down here once, thousands of years ago. Just like the sun. It had radiationand burning heat in its tail.The comet burned everything to the ground. There wasn’t a thing left. Indianpeople were here before that happened, living on the earth. But things werewrong; a lot of people had abandoned the spiritual path. The holy spirit warnedthem a long time before the comet came. Medicine men told everyone to prepare.Things were wrong with nature on the earth … Then that comet went through here.It had a long, wide tail and it burned up everything. It flew so low the tailscorched the earth … The comet made a different world. After that survival washard work. The weather was colder than before …1 [part0110.html#chapter3-1]There are other interesting details in the various versions of this myth toldamong the Ojibwa and recorded by anthropologist Thor Conway. For example thereis a reference to the comet killing off “giant animals … You can find theirbones today in the earth. It is said that the comet came down and spread histail for miles and miles.”2 [part0110.html#chapter3-2] At the time of thisevent, usually referred to as “the first burning of the earth,” we’re told thatthe Ojibwa “lived near the edge of the Frozen Lands.”3[part0110.html#chapter3-3] It is also recorded that soon after the cometdisaster “the first flooding of the earth” occurred.4 [part0110.html#chapter3-4]Just as the Ojibwa tradition laments that “things were wrong … people hadabandoned the spiritual path,” thus implicating human behavior in the disasterthat followed so, too, the Brule, one of the tribes of the Lakota Nation, tellof a time “in the world before this one,” when “the People and animals turned toevil and forgot their connection to the Creator.” In response, the Creatorresolved “to destroy the world and start over.” He first warned a few goodpeople to flee to the highest mountaintops, then sent down “fierce Thunderbirdsto wage a great battle against the other humans and the giant animals” (again,as in the Ojibwa myth, the Brule account speaks of animals of extraordinarysize).5 [part0110.html#chapter3-5]Finally, at the height of the battle, the Thunderbirds suddenly threw down theirmost powerful thunderbolts all at once. The fiery blast shook the entire world.Toppling mountain ranges and setting forests and prairies ablaze. The flamesleaped up to the sky in all directions, sparing only the few People on thehighest peaks … Even the rocks glowed red hot, and the giant animals and evilpeople burned up where they stood.Now the Creator began to make the world anew:As the Creator chanted the song of creation it began to rain. The Creator sanglouder and it rained harder until the rivers overflowed their banks and surgedacross the landscape. Finally the Creator stamped the Earth, and with a greatquake the Earth split open, sending great torrents across the entire world untilonly a few mountain peaks stood above the flood, sheltering the few People whohad survived … [After the flood subsided], as the People went out over the landthey found the bleached bones of the giant animals buried in rock and mud …People still find them today in the Dakota Badlands.6 [part0110.html#chapter3-6]Of particular note, when we remember that a species of giant beaver becameextinct in North America at the end of the Ice Age,7 [part0110.html#chapter3-7]is a myth of the Passamaquoddy, Micmac and Malisee that speaks of a being calledGlooscap, described as “a spirit, a medicine man and a sorcerer,” who createdthe first animals, among them the first beaver—a creature so large that when itbuilt a dam it “flooded the country from horizon to horizon.” Glooscap tappedthe beaver on its back and it shrank to its present size.8[part0110.html#chapter3-8]The reference to a flood in this story is one among hundreds in the myths of theNative Americans. Many of them contain intriguing details of great relevance tonew scientific information about events in North America at the end of the IceAge that we will explore in the following pages. For example, the Cowichan ofBritish Columbia recall a time in the remote past when their seers becamegreatly troubled on account of strange dreams which foretold destruction. Oneman said: “I have dreamed a strange thing. I dreamed that such rain fell that wewere all drowned.” Another said, “I dreamed that the river rose and flooded theplace, and we were all destroyed.” “So did I,” chimed another. “And I too.”9[part0110.html#chapter3-9]The seers were disbelieved by their people but nonetheless resolved to build ahuge raft of many canoes joined together. Not long after they were done the raincommenced. The drops were as large as hailstones and so heavy that they killedthe little babies. The river rose and all the valleys were covered. The seers,and those few of their friends who had believed them:took their families and placed them on the raft and took food and waited. By andby the raft rose with the water … At length the rain stopped, and they felt thewaters going down, and their raft rested on the top of Cowichan Mountain … Thenthey saw the land, but what desolation met their eyes! How their hearts werewrung with anguish. It was indescribable.10 [part0110.html#chapter3-10]Unusually large hailstones feature in a Quillayute cataclysm myth:For days and days great storms blew. Rain and hail and then sleet and snow camedown upon the land. The hailstones were so large that many of the people werekilled … [The survivors] grew thin and weak from hunger. The hailstones hadbeaten down the ferns and the camas and the berries. Ice locked the rivers sothat the men could not fish.11 [part0110.html#chapter3-11]The Pima, or “River People,” presently live in Arizona whence they migrated inremote antiquity from much farther north. As is the case with the Cowichan, aseer features in their cataclysm traditions—in this case a seer who was warnedby a great eagle that a flood was coming. The eagle visited the seer four timesand each time he ignored its warnings. “You’d better believe what I’m tellingyou,” said the eagle. “The whole valley will be flooded. Everything will bedestroyed.” “You’re a liar,” said the seer. “And you’re a seer who seesnothing,” said the eagle:The bird flew away, and hardly had he gone when a tremendous thunderclap washeard, the loudest there has ever been … The sun remained hidden behind darkclouds, and there was only twilight, gray and misty. Then the earth trembled,and there came a great roar of something immense moving. The people saw a sheergreen wall advancing toward them, filling the valley from one side to the other.At first they did not know what it was, and then they realized that it was awall of green water. Destroying everything in its path, it came like a hugebeast, a green monster, rushing upon them, foaming, hissing, in a cloud ofspray. It engulfed the seer’s house and carried it away with the seer, who wasnever seen again. Then the water fell upon the villages, sweeping away homes,people, fields and trees. The flood swept the valley clean as with a broom. Thenit rushed on beyond the valley to wreak havoc elsewhere.12[part0110.html#chapter3-12]The Inuit of Alaska preserve a tradition of an earthquake, accompanied by aterrible flood that swept so rapidly over the earth that only a few peoplemanaged to escape in their canoes, or take refuge on the tops of the highestmountains.13 [part0110.html#chapter3-13] The Luiseno of California also remembera flood that covered the mountains and destroyed most of mankind. Only those fewwho fled to the highest peaks were spared when all the rest of the world wasinundated.14 [part0110.html#chapter3-14] Similar flood myths were recorded amongthe Hurons.15 [part0110.html#chapter3-15] And the Montagnais, who belong to theAlgonquin family, relate how the god Michabo reconstructed the world after agreat flood:Michabo was hunting with his pack of trained wolves one day when he saw thestrangest sight: the wolves entered a lake and disappeared. He followed theminto the water to fetch them, and as he did so the entire world flooded. Michabothen sent forth a raven to find some soil with which to make a new earth, butthe bird returned unsuccessful in its quest. Then Michabo sent an otter to dothe same thing, but again to no avail. Finally he sent the muskrat and shebrought him back enough earth to begin the reconstruction of the world.16[part0110.html#chapter3-16]Lynd’s History of the Dakotas, written in the nineteenth century, preserves manyindigenous traditions that would otherwise have been lost. These include anIroquois myth that “the sea and the waters had at one time infringed upon theland so that all human life was destroyed.” The Chickasaws asserted that theworld had been destroyed by water, “but that one family was saved and twoanimals of every kind.” The Lakota (Dakotas) also spoke of a time when there wasno dry land and when all men disappeared from existence.17[part0110.html#chapter3-17]Myths speaking to scienceFor years an often acrimonious debate has been underway among scholars regardingthe peopling of the Americas. Who are the Native Americans, exactly? When didthey first arrive in the New World? And by what route?Whenever a resolution has begun to look possible, whenever some kind ofconsensus has been about to emerge, new information has been presented, by oneside or the other, that calls for a rethink. What has never been in dispute,however, is that the ancestors of today’s Native Americans were already in NorthAmerica 12,800 years ago, when the mysterious cold event that geologists callthe Younger Dryas began, and that they witnessed and hunted the megafauna thatflourished during the Ice Age including the gigantic Columbia Mammoth, thesomewhat smaller Wooly Mammoth, the giant beaver, short-faced bears, giantsloths, two species of tapirs, several species of peccaries and the fearsomeAmerican lion.It’s thought likely, therefore, that the references to very large animals in themyths cited above are not mere fantasies but preserve eye-witness accounts ofsome of the many genera of mega-mammals that were present in North Americabefore the Younger Dryas began, but had passed into extinction by the time itended 1,200 years later. The same goes for the floods that the myths describe,18[part0110.html#chapter3-18] for geologists agree that North America was indeedsubjected to episodes of cataclysmic flooding in the final millennia of the lastIce Age. What new research has called into question in the past decade, however,is whether the scale, extent and, most importantly, the causes of those floodshave been properly understood. The mainstream view is copiously represented, andendlessly repeated in books and journals published since the 1960s, but in orderto get to grips with a powerful alternative view that now poses a seriouschallenge to established theories, I made an extensive field trip across NorthAmerica in September and October 2014 with catastrophist researcher RandallCarlson.19 [part0110.html#chapter3-19]Randall cannot be a reincarnation of J Harlen Bretz, because J Harlen Bretz(whose first name was J and who hated it when proofreaders tried to treat itlike an initial) passed away on February 3, 1981, by which time Randall wasalready thirty years old. However in his passion for real fieldwork, for walkingthe walk rather than just reading the literature, and in his dogged advocacy ofa radical geological hypothesis concerning the cataclysmic floods that toreNorth America apart at the end of the Ice Age, Randall is in every meaningfulsense the new J Harlen Bretz.I will describe my travels with Randall, and the compelling evidence hepresented me with, in the chapters that follow, but first, you may well bewondering, who was J Harlen Bretz?Meet J Harlen BretzHere is Bretz, writing in 1928 after one of his field trips across WashingtonState in the Pacific Northwest of the US:No one with an eye for landforms can cross eastern Washington in daylightwithout encountering and being impressed by the “scabland.” Like great scarsmarring the otherwise fair face of the plateau are these elongated tracts ofbare, or nearly bare, black rock carved into mazes of buttes and canyons.Everybody on the plateau knows scabland. It interrupts the wheat lands,parceling them out into hill tracts less than 40 acres to more than 40 squaremiles in extent. One can neither reach them nor depart from them withoutcrossing some part of the ramifying scabland. Aside from affording a scantypasturage, scabland is almost without value. The popular name is an expressivemetaphor. The Scablands are wounds only partially healed—great wounds in theepidermis of soil with which Nature protects the underlying rock.With eyes only a few feet above the ground the observer today must travel backand forth repeatedly and must record his observations mentally,photographically, by sketch and by map before he can form anything approaching acomplete picture. Yet long before the paper bearing these words has yellowed,the average observer, looking down from the air as he crosses the region, willsee almost at a glance the picture here drawn by piecing together theground-level observations of months of work. The region is unique: let theobserver take the wings of the morning to the uttermost parts of the earth: hewill nowhere find its likeness.20 [part0110.html#chapter3-20]By 1928 Bretz was an experienced and highly credentialed field geologist. Bornin 1882, he’d started his career as a high school biology teacher in Seattle butspent most of his spare time exploring the geology of Puget Sound. Although hedidn’t have a geology degree at the time, he succeeded in getting severalarticles on his findings published in scientific journals.21[part0110.html#chapter3-21] In 1911 he enrolled at the University of Chicago topursue a doctorate in geology. He graduated summa cum laude in 1913 andimmediately thereafter returned to Seattle where he accepted a position asassistant professor of geology at the University of Washington.22[part0110.html#chapter3-22] He had difficulties with the attitudes of otherteaching staff there (he later described them as “stick-in-the-muds”23[part0110.html#chapter3-23]) and by 1914 he was back at the University ofChicago, initially as an instructor but soon afterward as an assistantprofessor.24 [part0110.html#chapter3-24]The first field trip Bretz made to the Scablands of eastern Washington was in1922. By this point, as a result of his earlier work, he was fully informedabout the Ice Age in all its dimensions and more aware than most othergeologists that immense ice sheets up to two miles deep had covered NorthAmerica for the best part of 100,000 years until the ice melted dramaticallysomewhere between 15,000 and 11,000 years ago. Thus when he saw huge numbers oferratics—giant boulders that didn’t belong naturally in the area but had clearlybeen brought in from elsewhere—he was inclined to assume that they might havetraveled here in icebergs carried on some great glacial flood. This impressionwas strengthened when he explored Grand Coulee and Moses Coulee—giganticchannels gouged deeply in the earth—and visited the Quincy Basin at the southernend of Grand Coulee where he found the whole 600-square-mile depression filledup to a depth of 400 feet with small particles of basalt debris. He couldn’thelp but wonder, “where had all the debris come from, and when?”25[part0110.html#chapter3-25] Again the answer that presented itself to him was aflood.image [../images/00015.jpeg]Figure 13Bretz was back in the Scablands in 1923 for three months of exploration and itseems to have been during this field trip that his later views—namely that “somespectacular hydrological event … had begun in this region, then abruptlystopped,” really began to take shape.26 [part0110.html#chapter3-26]In the November–December 1923 issue of the Journal of Geology Bretz published apaper summarizing his findings. To understand the somewhat defensive tone of thepaper it is important to keep in mind the prevailing geological doctrine of thetime, the principle known as “uniformitarianism.” This is the assumption thatexisting processes, acting as at present, are sufficient to account for allgeological changes. Integral to it is the parallel assumption of gradualism,namely that “the present is the key to the past” and that the rate of changeobservable today is an accurate guide to rates of change that prevailed in thepast.Such ideas, which had acquired the status of an unchallengeable truth by Bretz’sday, had themselves arisen from the necessary—indeed essential—overthrow of theold religious belief in creationism and the notion that God whimsicallyintervened in the earth’s history by ordaining cataclysms such as the BiblicalFlood. In righteous opposition to these thoughts of supernatural creation anddestruction, uniformitarianism seemed a profoundly rational response that sawonly the forces of nature at work upon the earth over periods of millions, orindeed billions of years.Mountains had not been built overnight, but had risen slowly, imperceptibly overtime. Likewise had fantastic geological features such as the Grand Canyon beeneroded by the flow of rivers over many millions of years.27[part0110.html#chapter3-27]Bretz was an eminently rational man, and certainly no religious dogmatist, yet,as his biographer John Soennichsen notes, “while hiking through the hot, dry,ragged world of the Scablands, everything he had seen pointed not to a slow,uniform change over time but to a catastrophe, a sudden release of colossalquantities of water that had quickly washed away the loessial topsoil and thencarved deeply into the basalt rock beneath.”28 [part0110.html#chapter3-28]The problem was—where had all this water come from? It was well understood thatat the margin of the North American ice sheets there must have been somemelting—as one indeed sees at the edges of all glaciers today. But such meltingcould hardly explain the magnitude of the erosive changes that were visible inthe field. As Bretz noted in his 1923 paper:The writer confesses that during ten weeks of study of the region, each newlyexamined scabland tract reawakened a feeling of amazement that such huge streamscould take origin from such small marginal tracts of an ice sheet, or that suchan enormous amount of erosion, despite high gradients, could have resulted inthe very brief times these streams existed. Not River Warren, nor the Chicagooutlet, not the Mowhawk channel, nor even Niagara Falls and Gorge itselfapproach the proportions of some of these scabland tracts and their canyons.From one of these canyons alone [Upper Grand Coulee] 10 cubic miles of basaltwas eroded by its glacial stream.29 [part0110.html#chapter3-29]Concluding the paper, and moving toward the profoundly heretical andanti-uniformitarian idea that would soon get him into a great deal of trouble,namely that a single cataclysmic flood unleashed in a very short period had beenresponsible for all the devastation he had witnessed, Bretz wrote:Fully 3,000 square miles of the Columbia plateau were swept by the glacialflood, and the loess and silt cover removed. More than 2,000 square miles ofthis area were left as bare, eroded, rock-cut channel floors, now the Scablands,and nearly 1,000 square miles carry gravel deposits derived from the erodedbasalt. It was a debacle which swept the Columbia Plateau.30[part0110.html#chapter3-30]In other words, as Bretz’s biographer summarizes, the geologist now believedthat the features he had documented “could only have been created by a flood ofunimaginable proportions, possibly the largest flood in the history of theworld.”31 [part0110.html#chapter3-31]The reaction of the geological establishment was one of stunned, embarrassedsilence. To have strayed so far from the doctrine of uniformitarianism couldonly mean that Bretz must have gone mad. David Alt, Professor Emeritus ofGeology at the University of Montana, describes one of the lectures that Bretzgave in which he expounded on the ideas in his 1923 paper:The geologists … were aghast in the same way that a roomful of physicists wouldbe upon hearing a colleague explain how he had made a perpetual motion machineout of old popsicle sticks. Physicists had all learned very early of thefutility of perpetual motion machines, and no properly educated geologist wassupposed to traffic in catastrophes of any sort.32 [part0110.html#chapter3-32]Alt describes an old professor of his own undergraduate days who had been astudent sitting in the audience when Bretz read his 1923 paper. It seems theprofessor did a hilarious impersonation of Bretz “pounding on the podium withboth fists and stomping on the floor as he used vivid language and gestures toconvey his idea of a catastrophic flood to his horrified audience.”33[part0110.html#chapter3-33]Quite apart from the theatricals, the geologists were shocked to hear Bretzinvoke:a sudden catastrophe to explain the Scablands of eastern Washington. In theirview this was a reversion to the unscientific thinking of some 125 years before.To this day, most geologists consider it nothing less than heresy to invoke acatastrophic explanation for a geologic event. So Bretz stepped off the edge ofa very long limb when he suggested that a great flood had eroded the Scablands …[It made] him a pariah among geologists, an outcast from the politer precinctsof society.34 [part0110.html#chapter3-34]The outcast did not give up, however. On the contrary, he doggedly continuedwith his research, bringing down ever more controversy on his head in theprocess but believing that facts, ultimately, would vindicate him.The crunch came on January 12, 1927 when Bretz was ambushed by a lynch mob ofhis colleagues at a lecture he’d been invited to give to the Geological Societyof Washington in the Cosmos Club, Washington DC. Bretz was by now calling “his”flood the “Spokane Flood” (after the town of Spokane) and liked to refer to theice sheet from which it had emerged as the “Spokane ice sheet” (neither term isused today but Bretz’s Spokane ice sheet was, effectively, the southern part ofthat great late Pleistocene ice sheet now known as the “Cordilleran”). Hebelieved that large parts of it must have melted with extraordinary rapidity,because “the volume of water was very great, almost incredibly great … In spiteof high gradients to draw it off, the pre-existing valleys first entered wereinadequate to carry it all, and the flood spread widely in a complicated groupof anastomosing routes.”35 [part0110.html#chapter3-35]image [../images/00016.jpeg]Figure 14: North America during the Ice Age.W.C. Alden, then the Chief of Pleistocene Geology with the profoundlyconservative US Geological Survey, objected to “the idea that all the channelsmust have been developed simultaneously in a very short time” and took greatoffense at “the tremendous amount of water” postulated by Bretz.36[part0110.html#chapter3-36] “It seems to me impossible,” Alden protested, “thatsuch part of the great ice fields as would have drained across the ColumbiaPlateau could, under any conditions, have yielded so much water as is called forin so short a time.”37 [part0110.html#chapter3-37] He admitted that he had nevervisited the Scablands himself but felt sure that a uniformitarian explanationwas what was required: “The problem would be easier if longer time and repeatedfloods could be allotted to do the work.”38 [part0110.html#chapter3-38]James Gilluly, well known as an apostle of geologic gradualism, dismissed thenotion of a single cataclysmic flood with words like “preposterous,”“incompetent,” and “wholly inadequate.”39 [part0110.html#chapter3-39] He foundnothing in Bretz’s evidence to exclude his own preferred solution, namely thatmultiple smaller floods had been involved and that these would have been “of theorder of magnitude of the present Columbia’s, or at most a few times aslarge.”40 [part0110.html#chapter3-40]Likewise G.R. Mansfield doubted that “so much work could be done on basalt in soshort a time … The Scablands seem to me better explained as the effects ofpersistent ponding and overflow of marginal glacial waters, which changed theirposition or their places of outlet from time to time through a somewhatprotracted period.”41 [part0110.html#chapter3-41]O.E. Meinzer was obliged to confess that “the erosion features of the region arelarge and bizarre” but he, too, preferred a gradualist explanation: “Before atheory that requires a seemingly impossible quantity of water is fully accepted,every effort should be made to account for the existing features withoutemploying so violent an assumption … I believe the existing features can beexplained by assuming normal stream work of the ancient Columbia River…”42[part0110.html#chapter3-42]In summary, not a single voice was raised in support of Bretz and there was muchpatronizing dismissal of his “outrageous hypothesis” of a single large flood. Inparticular, the massed geologists homed in on what they clearly believed was thefatal flaw in the case for a sudden and overwhelming cataclysm—namely that Bretzhad failed to identify a convincing source for his floodwaters.Bretz replied that he saw no logic in this, since lack of a documented sourcefor the flood did not prove that there had been no flood. “I believe that myinterpretation of Channeled Scabland should stand or fail on the scablandphenomena themselves,” he argued.43 [part0110.html#chapter3-43] He was, he said,as sensitive as anyone else to adverse criticism, and had “no desire to inviteattention simply by advocating extremely novel views.” Moreover, he himself hadrepeatedly been driven to doubt “the verity of the Spokane Flood,”44[part0110.html#chapter3-44] only to be forced “by reconsideration of the fieldevidence, to use again the conception of enormous volume … These remarkablerecords of running water on the Columbia Plateau, and in the valleys of theSnake and Columbia Rivers, cannot be interpreted in terms of ordinary riveraction and ordinary valley development … Enormous volume, existing for a veryshort time, alone will account for their existence.”45[part0110.html#chapter3-45]It was this accumulation of compelling field evidence that Bretz asked to beconsidered—not by emotion, not by intuition, not by reference to receivedwisdom, but only by “the established principles of the scientific method.”46[part0110.html#chapter3-46] “Ideas without precedent,” he was to write later:are generally looked on with disfavor and men are shocked if their conceptionsof an orderly world are challenged. A hypothesis earnestly defended begetsemotional reaction which may cloud the protagonist’s view, but if suchhypotheses outrage prevailing modes of thought the view of antagonists may alsobecome fogged.On the other hand, geology is plagued with extravagant ideas which spring fromfaulty observation and misinterpretation. They are worse than “outrageoushypotheses,” for they lead nowhere. The writer’s Spokane Flood hypothesis maybelong to the latter class, but it cannot be placed there unless errors ofobservation and direct inference are demonstrated.47 [part0110.html#chapter3-47]And this was the problem with all the criticisms of Bretz both before and afterthe Washington meeting. The geological establishment did not like what he had tosay, it flew in the face of their gradualist reference frame, and they regardedit as a “heresy that must be gently but firmly stamped out.”48[part0110.html#chapter3-48] In the final analysis, however, they could notdisprove his science, only disapprove of it, which is a very different thing.The heart of the matter remained Bretz’s assertion that the ice cap had meltedprecipitously and his inability to propose a mechanism that could have broughtabout such melting. He himself, as noted, did not regard this as a significantstumbling block, but his critics did. Over the years, therefore, in attempts toappease them, he several times reluctantly proposed two possible solutions.These were some sort of radical, short-lived climate change on the one hand, or,on the other, an episode of volcanic activity beneath the ice cap. He admittedof the former, however, that “no such climatic change is recorded elsewhere, andthe rapidity demanded seems impossible,” while of the latter, he observed that“nothing has been found in the literature to suggest Pleistocene volcanism inthe area which was drained across the Columbia Plateau.”49[part0110.html#chapter3-49]Interestingly, by the time Bretz faced his hostile peers in Washington he wasalready aware of—but had dismissed—the very explanation for cataclysmic floodingthat would much later be taken up by the geological establishment and open thedoor to the universal acceptance of his evidence that prevails today. In hisoutline for his January 1927 presentation he wrote: “Both Mr. Alden and Mr.Pardee have suggested that I consider the sudden draining of a glacial lake toaccount for the flood … Mr. Pardee [in a 1925 letter to Bretz] specifies LakeMissoula, which is the only one of any magnitude known in the region that mighthave functioned.”50 [part0110.html#chapter3-50]Eventually, in the 1940s, Bretz would indeed embrace a sudden draining ofGlacial Lake Missoula as the source for his flood but the reason why he did notdo so in 1927 is important and, as we shall see, of the greatest relevance tothe evolving debate about what exactly happened in North America at the end ofthe Ice Age. In brief Bretz’s view in 1927, as his biographer explains, was thatthe volume of Lake Missoula “might not have been adequate to form the Scablands.‘Twould run the flood for only 2 weeks,’ reads a handwritten comment by Bretz inthis section of his outline.”51 [part0110.html#chapter3-51]In March 1930, Bretz published a brief abstract in the Bulletin of theGeological Society of America. The abstract was titled “Lake Missoula and theSpokane Flood.” In it Bretz wrote that this lake had first been named anddescribed by the geologist J.T. Pardee (whose letter on the subject he’dreceived in 1925), that it stood more than 4,000 feet above sea level and thatit was at least 2,100 feet deep. Without going into any detail he noted that thelake had been held in place by an ice dam and that “seventy miles to thesouthwest, along the western arm of Purcell Trench and Spokane Valley, are theeasternmost heads of the scabland channels. If a bursting of the dam occurred,water could escape only along this seventy-mile stretch.”52[part0110.html#chapter3-52]By 1932 Bretz had warmed further to the idea that Lake Missoula could be theculprit behind his flood, although he felt that issues concerning thehypothetical ice dam and its proposed cataclysmic failure remained to be workedout.53 [part0110.html#chapter3-53] At this point in his life, however, he seemedready to move on and was to devote most of the next decade to other, completelydifferent, geological puzzles. Then, in 1940, he was invited to speak on hisScablands theory at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement ofScience being held in Seattle. He declined the invitation, saying that his viewsand evidence were already in print, but the event turned out to be a seminalone. J.T. Pardee was there and presented a paper on his work on Glacial LakeMissoula, making public for the first time his long-held conclusion that therehad been a failure of an ice dam and that “the entire lake had drainedcatastrophically and, most likely, quite dramatically.”54[part0110.html#chapter3-54]image [../images/00017.jpeg]Figure 15Curiously Pardee did not connect his Missoula findings to Bretz’s ownlong-standing and well-known case about the creation of the Channeled Scablandsby a catastrophic flood, but much later, Bretz would write: “He never said, atleast in print, anything about the final deposition of this vigorous discharge.I do believe, however, that he was generously leaving that to me.”55[part0110.html#chapter3-55]In the process of making the most of what had been left to him, Bretz abandonedhis single cataclysmic flood model in favor of one more palatable to hisopponents. “There were several floods,” he was eventually to write (in 1959).“The theory is elastic enough to take care of that.”56[part0110.html#chapter3-56] In the same year, Bretz was presented with the NeilMilner Award in honor of his exceptional contributions to Earth Sciences.57[part0110.html#chapter3-57]A few years later, in 1965, Bretz’s transformation from pariah to poster boyseemed complete. The International Union for Quaternary Research organized afield trip to the Columbia Plateau for many former critics of the catastrophicflood theory. The group traversed the full length of Grand Coulee, part of theQuincy Basin, and much of the Palouse-Snake scabland divide. At the end of thetrip the participants, humbled by what they had seen, and satisfied as to thesource of the flood-damage in Glacial Lake Missoula, sent Bretz a telegram ofgreetings and salutations. The telegram closed with the words: “We are all nowcatastrophists.”58 [part0110.html#chapter3-58]“Be assured,” wrote Bretz, “that after 30 years, and 30 papers in self-defense,and more than 30 people who vigorously denied my theory, it did my heart goodlike medicine.”59 [part0110.html#chapter3-59]The final accolade came in 1979 when Bretz, by then aged 96, received thePenrose Medal, the Geological Society of America’s highest accolade. After thisaward, he told his son: “All my enemies are dead, so I have no one to gloatover.”60 [part0110.html#chapter3-60]Bretz went on to his next great adventure, aged 98 years, on February 3, 1981.Gradualism draws the teeth of Bretz’s cataclysmSo … all seemed well. The evidence of a land scoured by cataclysmic deluge couldnot be denied. The timing had been set—perhaps not precisely, but at any ratesomewhere in the last millennia of the Ice Age between 15,000 and 11,000 yearsago. The source of the deluge had been tracked down to Glacial Lake Missoula.And the crunch-point of whether there had been just one gigantic flood—whichBretz’s honed instincts as a field geologist had originally suggested—ormultiple floods, as his gradualist colleagues preferred, had been conceded withreference to the elasticity of his theory and an allowance of “several” floods.It becomes clear in later papers published by Bretz that he was willing toaccept that up to eight floods had occurred.61 [part0110.html#chapter3-61] Thiswas, undoubtedly, a concession to gradualism—eight smaller floods politelyspread out over a period of some thousands of years being more palatable tothose of a uniformitarian persuasion (i.e. to most geologists, then and now)than a single humongous event of great violence that occurred suddenly, didmassive damage, and was over and done with in about three months. NonethelessBretz remained a catastrophist at heart. Victor R. Baker of the Department ofHydrology and Water Resources at the University of Arizona notes in his study,The Spokane Flood Debates, that while Bretz did indeed extensively modify hisoriginal hypothesis,there was a lingering suspicion that one was dealing with an unusual exceptionto a general rule. Bretz himself had claimed: “The unique assemblage of forms …described … as the Channeled Scabland … records a unique episode in Pleistocenehistory … Special causes seem clearly indicated.”62 [part0110.html#chapter3-62]In other words, regardless of any concessions, what is referred to here arecauses that were still unique and special enough to be described as catastrophicand that did not undermine the conclusion that “it was a debacle which swept theColumbia plateau.”63 [part0110.html#chapter3-63] It is surely significant thatin his last published work, a note he wrote to the Geological Society of Americain 1979 accepting its highest accolade, the Penrose Medal, that Bretz took theopportunity to drive this point home. “Perhaps,” he wrote:I can be credited with reviving and demystifying legendary catastrophism andchallenging a too rigorous uniformitarianism.64 [part0110.html#chapter3-64]What Bretz the catastrophist and challenger of uniformitarianism could not haveknown, however, was that once he had invited the vampire of gradualism throughthe door it would not be satisfied with the compromise that he had tried tostrike, but would keep on remorselessly sucking the blood out of any notion thatwhat had happened in the Channeled Scablands had been any sort of “debacle” atall.Thus, as the years have gone by and new generations of gradualist scholars havetaken their places at universities around the world, the eight floods that werefirst allowed to modify Bretz’s single cataclysm have steadily increased innumber—to a dozen, then to more than twenty, then to thirty-five, then to “aboutforty,” and finally, in recent papers, to as many as ninety or more!65[part0110.html#chapter3-65] “The most current opinion,” summarizes Vic Baker,“is that there were about eighty floods that all occurred within a period of2,500 years [roughly between 15,000 years ago and 12,000 years ago], possibly atregular intervals.”66 [part0110.html#chapter3-66]Eighty floods in 2,500 years works out at one flood approximately everythirty-one years—thus doing away with any need for a single exceptionalcataclysm and accounting for the horrendous mess of the Channeled Scablands bythe accumulated effects of a rather regular, predictable, essentially gradualistseries of events. Better still, from the uniformitarian point of view, outburstfloods from ice-dammed glacial lakes still occur today. They happen regularly inIceland, for example, where they are called jökulhlaups, the term that has beenadopted for them worldwide, and that I will continue to use here. Otherlocations where they are common include the Himalayas, Antarctica, NorthernSweden, and North America. As Geology Professor David Alt points out, severalglacially dammed lakes in Alaska and northern British Columbia are prone toepisodes of very fast drainage. These events usually occur “in summer when afast snowmelt rapidly raises the level of the lake. The ice dam that heldGlacial Lake Missoula probably floated and broke during the summer for the samereason.”67 [part0110.html#chapter3-67]In this way the uniformitarian doctrine that “the present is the key to thepast,” and that the rate of change observable today is an accurate guide torates of change that prevailed in the past, has quietly reasserted itself andBretz’s disturbing flood evidence has been explained away as nothing very muchto worry about after all. The scholars have also rather cleverly contrived tohave their cake and eat it: on the one hand giving Bretz a medal and proclaimingthat they are “all catastrophists now”; on the other quietly transmuting Bretz’scatastrophe into the sort of thing that one sees every summer in Alaska andBritish Columbia.This is all very reassuring, of course, but suppose that Bretz’s originalinsight was right and that what happened in North America at the end of the IceAge really was a sudden, cataclysmic flood, something unprecedented andunmatched since?Suppose it really was a debacle?Back to BretzRandall Carlson is quite certain that it was indeed a debacle—one that unfoldedon an almost unbelievable scale—and has spent the last twenty years trekkingback and forth across the Channeled Scablands asking local geologists difficultquestions that no one else seems to have considered and building a formidablecase.The sort of case, I suspect, that Bretz would be making if he were still with usand at the height of his powers.I first met Randall in 2006. The North American Ice Age floods were among thesubjects we discussed and I was startled to discover that he didn’t accept theice dam theory at all, and regarded Glacial Lake Missoula as a huge diversion—aneasy solution that panders to uniformitarian prejudices and has led geologistsaway from the truth. In the years that followed we corresponded from time totime and occasionally bumped into each other at conferences where we were bothspeaking. I was enormously impressed by his depth of knowledge, by his fieldexperience and by the intriguing new insights his research seemed to offer intothe mysterious events that brought the Ice Age to an end. I found we shared aparticular and growing interest in the Younger Dryas—that return to full glacialconditions that began suddenly 12,800 years ago, just when the world seemed tobe warming up, and that ended equally suddenly 1,200 years later.During this peculiar episode certain Stone Age hunter-gatherer peoples such asthe “Clovis” culture of North America vanished from the archaeological recordand there were mass extinctions of animal species—so clearly something unusualwas going on—yet no uniformitarian or gradualist explanations have ever beenoffered. Moreover, although I didn’t investigate it in my 1995 book Fingerprintsof the Gods, I realized afterward that the span of the Younger Dryas, from12,800 years ago to 11,600 years ago, coincided exactly with the “window” duringwhich I had argued that an advanced civilization of prehistoric antiquity wasobliterated from the face of the earth and lost from human memory.Accordingly in my book Underworld, published in 2002, I was more attentive tothe Younger Dryas problem. “At around 13,000 years ago,” I noted:the long period of uninterrupted warming that the world had just passed through(and that had greatly intensified, according to some studies, between 15,000years ago and 13,000 years ago68 [part0110.html#chapter3-68]) was instantlybrought to a halt—all at once, everywhere—by a global cold event known topalaeoclimatologists as the “Younger Dryas” …69 [part0110.html#chapter3-69] Inmany ways mysterious and unexplained, this was an almost unbelievably fastclimatic reversion—from conditions that are calculated to have been warmer andwetter than today’s 13,000 years ago,70 [part0110.html#chapter3-70] toconditions that were colder and drier than those at the last glacial maximumjust a few hundred years later.71 [part0110.html#chapter3-71]From that moment, around 12,800 years ago, it was as though an enchantment ofice had gripped the earth. In many areas that had been approaching terminalmeltdown full glacial conditions were restored with breathtaking rapidity andall the gains that had been made since the LGM [Last Glacial Maximum—around21,000 years ago] were simply stripped away: “Temperatures … fell back on theorder of 8–15 degrees centigrade … with half this brutal decline possiblyoccurring within decades. The Polar Front in the North Atlantic redescended tothe level of Cabo Finisterre in northwest Spain and glaciers readvanced in thehigh mountain chains. With respect to temperature the setback to full glacialconditions was nearly complete…”72 [part0110.html#chapter3-72]For human populations at the time, in many except the most accidentally favoredparts of the world, the sudden and inexplicable plunge into severe cold andaridity must have been devastating.73 [part0110.html#chapter3-73]The sense of mystery—and mortal danger to mankind—that clung about the YoungerDryas continued to intrigue me, encouraging me to read up on it and try tounderstand it better. I recall a number of conversations and email exchangeswith Randall after 2006 that focused on the subject and it became increasinglyobvious to me that the Younger Dryas had been a global cataclysm in everymeaningful sense of the term. It wasn’t until 2013, however, when Randall madethe case to me that North America, and particularly the Channeled Scablands, hadstood at the epicenter of that cataclysm, that I decided it was time to see theevidence on the ground. On impulse I invited him to join me on a field trip. Ittook more than a year to find a time that worked for both our schedules butfinally, in September 2014 I met Randall in Portland, Oregon, and we took offeast and north into neighboring Washington State to explore the Scablands in thebig, red four-wheel drive we’d hired."},{"pageContent":" Chapter 4 [part0131.html#c_ch4]Journey Through the Scablands [part0131.html#c_ch4]We’re on a 2,500 mile (4,000 kilometer) road trip from Portland, Oregon toMinneapolis, Minnesota. The journey would be shorter if we took the directroute. But we’re stopping and diverting into coulees and river valleys andaround buttes and up the sides of mountains and across the Channeled Scablandsimmediately south of the vast Cordilleran and Laurentide ice caps that oncecovered much of North America. The objective is for me to get as full anunderstanding as possible of what happened here and by the fourth day, when wereach Dry Falls in the middle of the extraordinary scar on the landscape calledGrand Coulee, the picture is beginning to become clear.The ground under our feet is ancient black basalt covered with a thin layer oftopsoil. The basalt, extruded by volcanic eruptions between seventeen millionand six million years ago, covers much of the Columbia Plateau and in someplaces is 2,000 meters (6,600 feet) thick.1 [part0111.html#chapter4-1]image [../images/00018.jpeg]Figure 16Not in Grand Coulee, though, because here it’s as if some capricious force,perhaps even the hand of God himself, has seized a giant chisel with a blademiles wide, plunged it violently into the earth and gouged out a sheer-sidedgash hundreds of feet deep and almost 60 miles (96 kilometers) long. The“chisel,” however, was not made of steel but of immense quantities of rushing,turbulent, debris-laden water that flowed for a few weeks only—the water ofBretz’s flood. “Grand Coulee,” he wrote, affords:the greatest example of canyon-cutting by glacial streams not alone for theColumbia Plateau, but for the world … A glacial river three miles in minimumwidth spilled southward here over the divide and down a steep monoclinal slope …The stream descended nearly 1,000 feet on a grade of approximately 10 degrees …Such a situation is unparalleled, even in this region of huge, suddenlyinitiated, high-gradient rivers … At least 10 cubic miles of basalt wereexcavated and removed.2 [part0111.html#chapter4-2]Bretz refers here only to the northern or Upper part of Grand Coulee.3[part0111.html#chapter4-3] But the same amount of basalt again was alsoexcavated from Lower Grand Coulee as “the stream” rushed on. Making our way heretoday we paused in the Ephrata Erratics Fan, south of the southern end of LowerGrand Coulee, to see where all that basalt excavated by the waters was dumped.It was a chaotic, jumbled, disturbing sight—disturbing because as far as the eyecould see in all directions across the prairie lay scattered countlessthousands—more likely millions—of jagged, broken basalt boulders, some about thesize of a family car, some smaller—down to the size of a football—and manylarger.“Everything was reduced to rubble,” Randall Carlson explained to me, as we stoodthere in the midst of the Fan, “and that’s what you’re seeing. This rubble waspart of the former world.”“The former world?”“Yes. The antediluvian world. And what’s lying here on the surface is just afraction of what the flood flushed out of Grand Coulee. The rubble goes downdeep. Hundreds of feet deep.”From the Ephrata Fan we drove north on Washington State Route 17 into LowerGrand Coulee, it’s sheer, forbidding basalt cliffs rearing up on either side ofus, the gray rainclouds above reflected darkly in the chain of alkalinelakes—Soap Lake, Lenore Lake, Blue Lake and Park Lake—that lie ponded in itsfloor. Now we’ve reached Dry Falls at the head of Lower Grand Coulee and as weget out of the truck Randall reminds my wife Santha to bring her camera. “You’regoing to see something cataclysmic here,” he announces with a mischievous grin.Meet Randall CarlsonYou may be too young to remember the 1977 TV series called The Life and Times ofGrizzly Adams, but you can always Google it if you weren’t here.The eponymous hero, a tough woodsman played by actor Dan Haggerty, was a big,bluff, bearded sort of fellow and Randall Carlson, by virtue of his enormousbeard, his general appearance and his rough, gruff personal style, reminds me ofhim a lot. Randall lives in Atlanta, Georgia, now, but he spent most of hisyouth in rural Minnesota and his voice still carries the quirky undertones ofScandinavian and German that make the Minnesota accent so recognizable.He grew up on the shores of Schmidt Lake, one of tens of thousands of smallmeltwater lakes spread across Minnesota and Wisconsin, and he used to go fishingthere as a boy, perched on a huge boulder that he afterward understood to be aglacial erratic—“a boulder quarried from bedrock and carried by an advancingglacier perhaps many hundreds of miles from its source to be deposited in alocation far removed from its origin.”4 [part0111.html#chapter4-4]Today, half a century on from his boyhood, he says that the Midwesternlandscapes of his youth have left an indelible imprint on his psyche:From these early experiences I entered into a sort of dialogue with the earthwhich continues unabated to this day. This dialogue has involved thousands ofhours spent in the field, traversing and studying a wide variety of landscapes,along with thousands of hours in the study of various sciences related in oneway or another to the goal of understanding this extraordinary planet upon whichwe are engaged in this ongoing human experience … It is a fearsomely dynamicplanet, one that has undergone profound changes on a scale far exceedinganything within recent times. In fact I now realize that what we think of ashistory is merely the record of human events that have transpired since thelast, great planetary catastrophe. I also understand that the imprint of thesecatastrophes is to be found all around us, in virtually every environment, andwe are just beginning to be able to perceive and decipher the evidence.5[part0111.html#chapter4-5]Randall makes his living as an architect and builder but his passion is geology.Catastrophist geology.And as those who have attended one of his lectures will attest, he knows moreabout it than pretty much anyone else you are ever likely to meet. He hasgleaned his knowledge from a vast reading of the scientific literature and, ashe says above, from thousands of hours of fieldwork. To me this sort ofin-depth, on-the-ground learning, the miles walked through the wilderness, theyears of dedicated library research, mean far more than any university degree.Randall is not a geologist and does not claim to be a geologist but his grasp ofthe subject is worth a dozen PhDs.And right now we’re standing on a sort of concrete pier with waist-high fencing,suspended out over the plunging horseshoe amphitheater of Dry Falls. There’s achill wind blowing this late September day and Randall is about to give me ageology lesson …Dry Falls“Ever been to Niagara Falls?” Randall asks.6 [part0111.html#chapter4-6]I confess that I have not.“But you’ve seen photographs? You have a sense of the place?”“I suppose, so, yes…”“OK, so just a guess … Which is bigger?” He indicates the vista that confrontsus. “Dry Falls? Or Niagara?”I’m thinking it’s a trick question. Randall, being a Minnesotan, is of coursecompelled to ask trick questions. I look out at the natural amphitheater. It’s along way down. And a long way across. A couple of circular lakes of pooledrainwater, overgrown with reeds, decorate the base of the towering horseshoe ofsheer cliffs confronting me—over which, it is absolutely obvious, hugequantities of water must once have flowed. I haven’t been to the Niagara Falls,which are 51 meters high, but I did spend a day of amazement at Victoria Fallsin southern Africa, and they’re 108 meters high. The classic horseshoe shape ofNiagara that you see in all the pictures is repeated at Victoria Falls. Andhere’s the same horseshoe shape in Washington State in the US, preserved in thedry fossil of an ancient cataract.“Dry Falls is bigger than Niagara,” I say, sounding more confident than I feel.“Okay, good so far, but how much bigger?”“Twice as big,” I hazard a guess.“Not bad,” Randall says. “But actually Dry Falls is close to three times as highas Niagara and more than six times as wide.” He points. “See how the cliffs arescalloped there?”I do. The Dry Falls horseshoe is in fact two horseshoes side by side, one to theeast, one to the west.“Well, Niagara would fit easily into just half of the eastern horseshoe and itsrim would be almost two hundred and fifty feet beneath the rim of Dry Falls.Also—look there…” Randall draws my attention to the eastern side of thehorseshoe where there’s a gap and then a high, narrow fin of cliffs runningsouth. “That’s Umatilla Rock,” he says, indicating the fin. It would have been akind of island at the peak of the flood. An underwater island.”“Underwater?”“Yes. When the flood came through here, the water was more than five hundredfeet deep. It would have overtopped Umatilla Rock, and the Falls themselves, andright here where we’re standing, by, oh, a hundred, maybe a hundred and fiftyfeet.”“So if I’d been able to stand here then…”“Which you wouldn’t have…”“I know. I’d have been swept away, but just for the sake of argument, if I hadbeen able to stand here, I take it I wouldn’t have seen a sheer sheet of waterbursting over the lip of the falls and crashing down hundreds of feet?”“No, because that was happening far beneath the surface. What you would haveseen at this point would have looked more like a whirling, churning slope in thetorrent with some kind of abrupt bump or gradient in it than an actualwaterfall, but all the work that a waterfall does on rock was still going on,under the surface…”“What do you mean by work on the rock?”“The water is coming through here in enormous quantities and horribly fast,running at up to seventy miles an hour according to some estimates, and you’vegot to realize that it isn’t just water. It’s more like a slurry of thick mud,and there’s whole forests torn up by their roots that are roiling around in it,and fleets of icebergs jostling on the surface, and down at the bottom there’s ahuge rumbling rubble of rocky debris, boulders like the ones we saw dumped allover the Ephrata Fan, and this whole mess is rushing and tumbling and pluckingas it passes…”“Plucking?”“Yes, that’s the best way to describe it. Like giant fingers plucking out blocksof the basalt bedrock, ripping them out, dragging them into the torrent andsweeping them downstream—that’s how the erosive work is done.” Randall gesturesagain at the scalloped, horseshoe cliffs. “But what we see from here is lessthan half the picture. If we were up in an airplane looking down we’d seeanother set of horseshoes even bigger than these ones off to the east, wrappinground beyond Umatilla Rock…”“So with all that taken into account, what’s the total extent of Dry Falls?”“About three and a half miles … That was where it had got to when the floodstopped. God only knows what it would have ended up looking like, or where itwould have been today, if the flood had continued even for another couple ofweeks…”“I don’t understand.”“The indications are that the flood only lasted a matter of weeks, andthroughout that time the falls were constantly migrating northward…”“Migrating?”“Yes, all falls migrate, at different rates depending on the amount and force ofthe water flowing over them. They pluck at the bedrock and constantly eat itaway upstream. Take Niagara, for example. It’s retreated seven miles in the lasttwelve thousand years,7 [part0111.html#chapter4-7] but that’s puny compared withwhat happened here, where the retreat was about thirty miles—the whole length ofLower Grand Coulee—in less than a month.”“So the rate of erosion was incredibly fast?”“Yes! Thousands of times faster than Niagara, because of the incredible amountand force of the water here. Dry Falls was the greatest waterfall that’s everexisted on planet earth.”“And all that water’s supposed to have come out of Glacial Lake Missoula?”“Well,” says Randall. His beard juts out stubbornly. “That’s the theory.”Erratic huntingRandall doesn’t buy the gradualist theory that multiple emptyings of LakeMissoula through multiple breakings and remakings and breaking again of its icedam can account for the evidence on the ground. He doesn’t dispute that theglacial lake existed, or that there were outburst floods from it, but he’sconvinced it was never anywhere near big enough to account for all thecataclysmic features of the Channeled Scablands. Like J Harlen Bretz in the1920s, he believes that one sudden, short-lived, totally exceptional flood oftruly immense proportions was the real culprit.On another day Randall takes me “erratic hunting” to explain why. We pull offInterstate 97 onto the Waterville Plateau and drive across rugged, rollingcountry where occasional green and yellow fields intermingle with wildermoorland too poor ever to be farmed. Pretty soon we start seeing huge clusters,flocks, packs, crowds of giant boulders all of ominous black basalt, all aliento this landscape and I know enough, now, to recognize them for what they are.As ice caps move and spread they snatch up, enchain and transport huge rocksthat then remain locked within them until the ice melts and drops its load. Whathappened here—the place is actually called “Boulder Park” and is recognized as aNational Natural Landmark—was a different aspect of the same process. “When theIce Age flood came pouring down over the Waterville Plateau,” Randall explains:it was carrying thousands of icebergs with it—icebergs as big as oil-tankerswith house-sized boulders frozen inside them. When they bumped up againsthillsides [he points to a distant ridge with ranks of colossal boulders strewnacross it] the icebergs grounded and stuck there. Eventually, after the floodhad subsided, they melted out leaving the boulders where they sit to this daystrewn all over the top of the plateau beyond the ridge and carpeting thehillside for twenty miles going north.“But that ridge must be what, eight hundred, maybe nine hundred feet above us,”I observe.“Exactly! Which tells us that the water was at least that deep here. Or rather,not simply water but a sludge slurry, and as the flood starts to subside theslurry just gets thicker and thicker with sediment until it finally leaves thewhole valley floor covered in sediment hundreds of feet thick and filled withembedded boulders. I mean, again, we are looking at the ruins and wreckage of aformer world.”We get back onto Interstate 97 heading south along the west bank of the majesticColumbia river and divert west on Alternate 97 toward Lake Chelan. Fifty mileslong and never more than a mile and a half wide, lying in the bottom of aforested, steep-sided valley overshadowed by lofty mountains, Chelan has thelook and feel of a grand Scottish loch. It is appropriate, therefore, that italso has traditions of a lake monster—a dragon, according to Native Americanlegends—that ate up all the game, leaving the people starving. The Great Spiritwas angered and decided to intervene. He descended from the sky:and struck the earth with his huge stone knife. All the world shook from hisblow. A great cloud appeared over the plain. When the cloud went away, peoplesaw that the land had changed. Huge mountain peaks rose on all sides of them.Among the mountains were canyons. Extending from the northwest to the southeastfor a two days’ journey was a very deep canyon. The Great Spirit threw themonster’s body into this deep and long gorge. Then he poured much water into itand so formed the lake. Long afterward, Indians called it Chelan.8[part0111.html#chapter4-8]image [../images/00019.jpeg]Figure 17Chelan means “Deep Water” in the local Salish Indian language, and Lake Chelanis indeed 1,468 feet (453 meters) deep, making it the third deepest lake in theUS and the twenty-sixth deepest in the world.9 [part0111.html#chapter4-9] Someaspects of the myth, I note in passing, are evocative of earth changes at theend of the Ice Age. Mountains that had been hidden beneath the ice cap, and thattherefore no one had seen before, did indeed appear when the ice melted. Canyonswere indeed carved through the whole of the Columbia Plateau by the rushingwaters of Bretz’s flood. And as we will see in the next chapter there may alsobe more than meets the eye to the huge stone knife from the sky striking theground so hard that “the world shook,” and to that ominous cloud that appearedover the land. Likewise, the presence of an immense iceberg-rafted erratic abovethe town of Manson on Chelan’s north shore10 [part0111.html#chapter4-10]suggests that the notion of “much water” being poured into the lake, in otherwords of a flood passing through here, may also be rooted in memories of realevents.After passing more erratics scattered around the southern end of Lake Chelan,11[part0111.html#chapter4-11] we head back to Interstate 97, cross to the eastbank of the Columbia River at Beebe Bridge, then go north to the mouth of McNeilCanyon where yet more boulder-strewn moorland awaits us. Numbering in theirthousands, the erratics here are known locally as “haystack boulders” because oftheir distinctive appearance, but the rounded profile they show from a distancegives way, close up, to a mass of jagged and splintered black basalt. Many ofthem are thought to weigh more than 10,000 tons, and as Randall and I examinethem, I’m daunted by their great height and mass, and amazed at the power andenergy of the floodwaters that brought them here.We get back on Interstate 97 again and drive the forty miles south to theconfluence of the Wenatchee and Columbia Rivers near the eastern foothills ofthe Cascade Mountains. Here Randall has a last giant erratic to show me, thisone weighing, he estimates, 18,000 tons. It stands high up on the side of along, wide valley, looming over a modern housing development, hundreds of feetabove the confluence of the rivers and the town of Wenatchee.We scramble to the top of the erratic so we can look down on the riversglistening far below. “Obviously,” Randall explains, “the flood waters must havefilled the whole valley from bottom to top so when the iceberg floated in itstranded right here then melted away and left this sitting on the ridge.”“And the flood itself? Where did it go next?”“The water coming down through here met the water coming out of Grand Coulee andMoses Coulee and many other scabland channels, and then it all together floweddown to Pasco Basin and Wallula Gap…”Black rainThe next day finds us on top of a high bluff overlooking Wallula Gap. “So thewater here rose up to roughly 1,200 feet above sea level,” Randall says.12[part0111.html#chapter4-12] He consults his GPS, “and where we’re standing nowis 1,150 feet above sea level, so the flood would have been fifty feet over ourheads.”“And the water came from which direction?”Randall points north: “It came roaring out of the Channeled Scablands. A mass ofdifferent flows converged here, and then passed on through, down the Columbia.So this was the gathering of the waters. Here’s where all of these great floodstreams came together.”I look out over the scene below, a drama of earth, and sky … and water.The sky is gray, thunderous and filled with rain as it has been throughout ourtrip. The earth element begins with a very thick, powdery layer of softdun-colored dust called loess that lies everywhere under our feet on the top ofthe bluff. But then the bluff plunges away in a steep tumbling fall down to theColumbia—which forms the water element—below. Across the stream, more than amile wide here, the terrain rises again toward the east, not so sheer as on thewest side where we’re standing, still covered by that same thick layer ofpowdery loess and marked in addition by distinctive scabland topography, withcliffs plunging into valleys and a series of outcrops carved by the ancientfloods—most prominently the two isolated basalt pillars known as the “TwinSisters” that stand directly opposite us.“Those Twin Sisters,” Randall explains, “are a remnant … Look there, immediatelyto the left of the Sisters you can see a shelf. That would have all beencontinuous … I believe that was the pre-flood valley floor … When the flood hit,it ripped through here and lowered the valley floor by about two hundred feet,based on the present depth of the river and the height of the Twin Sisters. Hadthe flood continued for a week longer the Twins would have been washed away aswell … They would have been about eight hundred feet underwater. And really, ifyou look across—there, way above the level of the Sisters—you’ll see thatuppermost outcrop of basalt, roughly at our level. That would have been the highwater mark and everything below that was underwater at the peak of the flood—sowhat you’re seeing over there in the scabland around the Sisters is thatspectacular erosion of the basalt by the water, just ripping through here atsixty or seventy miles an hour because the back pressure would have been sogreat.”“Fearsome and ferocious flows,” I hazard.“Oh, my God, yes! Like an inland sea, except that it’s moving…”“And it’s turbulent and it’s angry…”“And the turbulence is increasing massively as it comes up to this constrictionat Wallula Gap. But when you look at the capacity of this valley, it would havehad to have been a hell of a lot of water pouring in from the north to backfloodto the extent that it did. The valley out of Lake Missoula is no bigger thanthis one and it’s two hundred miles north of here. So how could that water havespilled out of Lake Missoula, traveled two hundred miles to here, and not haveattenuated to the degree that it would just pass through without ponding abovethe gap? But it did pond, massively and deeply as we can tell from the highwater mark. And that, to me, is just incontrovertible evidence that there wasmore water pouring into this than could ever have been pouring out of LakeMissoula.”“So,” I summarize, “we have water twelve hundred feet deep which flows throughhere turbulently…”“Very turbulently…”“And then how long does it stay that deep?”“The estimates are that it’s probably one to three weeks, and then it begins toebb away. Because … they call this hydraulic ponding. This was effectively ahydraulic dam in the sense that the water itself, forced through a constrictionlike Wallula Gap, becomes a kind of dam—and especially so since the water herewas filled with massive icebergs. All throughout the flood pathway are erraticsthat were carried by icebergs—all the way down into Eugene, Oregon … You gottapicture it. You’ve got a moving sea choked with thousands of icebergs…”I’m getting the picture all right. “Wild scene,” I say.“Wild scene,” Randall agrees. “All of these icebergs are jostling up againsteach other and getting jammed in the gap. And what that’s going to do is causethe water level to rise still further until the pressure increases enough topush the whole mass down through the gap—then the water level drops until thenext jam occurs. So I think what we’re seeing is a pulsating hydrograph thatevery time it rises, it backfloods further up the valley, and then the waterlevel drops and then it rises again.”The next point I put to Randall, closely connected to the vision of the floodedhellworld that he’s just conjured up, relates to the central enigma I wish toexplore in the rest of this section, but which I have not yet placed before thereader. It concerns the growing body of evidence that 12,800 years ago a giantcomet traveling on an orbit that took it through the inner solar system broke upinto multiple fragments, and that many of these fragments, some more than a mile(2.4 kilometers) in diameter, hit the earth. It is believed that North Americawas the epicenter of the resulting cataclysm with several of the largest impactson the North American ice cap causing floods and tidal waves and throwing a vastcloud of dust into the upper atmosphere that enshrouded the earth, preventingthe sun’s rays from reaching the surface and thus initiating the sudden,mysterious global deep freeze that geologists call the Younger Dryas. We will gointo the evidence for all this, and how it relates to “Bretz’s flood”—whichmight not, after all, have emerged from Lake Missoula—in the chapters thatfollow. But for now, please bear with me as I play out the rest of myconversation with Randall at Wallula Gap.“And there’s been a comet impact,” I say, “so we’re expecting that the sky isgoing to be bad too…”“Oh, it’s got to be…”“Dark…” I think about it, then add: “Lots of stuff wafted up there by theimpact.”“Stuff!” Randall kicks a furrow in the soft dust with the toe of his hikingboot. “That’s what I think this six-foot layer of loess is. All over the floodareas you see this six, seven, eight-foot thick layer of loess—and clearly itrained down out of the atmosphere.”“Like the legends of Kon-Tiki Viracocha.” I name the South American civilizinghero, white-skinned and bearded like Quetzalcoatl and the Apkallu sagesdescribed in Chapter One, who was said to have come to the Andes during aterrifying period, thousands of years in the past, “when the earth had beeninundated by a great flood and plunged into darkness by the disappearance of thesun.”13 [part0111.html#chapter4-13] (Exactly like Quetzalcoatl in Mexico, andthe Apkallu sages in Mesopotamia, Viracocha’s civilizing mission in the Andeshad been to bring laws and a moral code to the survivors of the disaster, and toteach them the skills of agriculture, architecture and engineering.)“Ah yes,” Randall muses. “The legends of Viracocha. Wasn’t there something thereabout a black rain?”“There was, absolutely. A thick, black rain. It’s pretty much universal to theflood myths I’ve studied…”Randall kicks the loess again. “This stuff is puzzling you know. It has a kindof vertical structure. Most theories suggest that it’s windborne, but thevertical structure is inconsistent with that. I’m developing an idea that it’sactually both water and windborne, because I think that the final rainout afterthe comet hit the ice cap was essentially a rainout of mud. There would havebeen a huge injection of superheated water into the stratosphere—filthy,particle-laden water—which would have then spread rather like the debris cloudof a nuclear explosion and the end result would undoubtedly have been a veryintense, and prolonged rainout.”But did a comet hit the earth 12,800 years ago?As we’ll see in the next chapter, the evidence assembled by an internationalteam of highly credentialed scientists is taking the comfortable world ofgradualist, uniformitarian geology by storm."},{"pageContent":" Chapter 5 [part0131.html#c_ch5]Nanodiamonds Are Forever [part0131.html#c_ch5]Continuing our journey east through the northern states of the US, after leavingWashington and driving across the Idaho panhandle, Randall made a point ofshowing me some of the spectacular features of Camas Prairie in western Montana.There, what look to the unpracticed eye like a series of colossal dunes march inserried ranks across the flat yellow floor of an elliptical basin, twelve mileslong and ten miles wide, in the midst of the Rocky Mountains. But the “dunes,”it turns out, are not dunes at all. Instead they are giant current ripples, somemore than fifty feet high and three hundred feet long, formed at the end of theIce Age when Camas Prairie was part of the bed of Glacial Lake Missoula and layunder about 1,400 feet of water.1 [part0112.html#chapter5-1] Geologists areagreed that the ripples were shaped by powerful currents set in motion when thelake drained catastrophically.2 [part0112.html#chapter5-2]“And I don’t dispute it,” Randall says, as we stand on a vantage point above theprairie. A largely deserted highway runs through the floor of the ancient basin,but now as a vehicle appears, providing scale, I see that it’s dwarfed tomatchbox size by the ripples.image [../images/00020.jpeg]Figure 18“So,” I ask, “you have nothing against the existence of Lake Missoula as such?Or the notion that it did drain catastrophically?”“No, nothing at all. I have no doubt there were dozens of jökulhlaups out ofLake Missoula. Some were even pretty big. My point, though, is that none of themwere of sufficient size to cause the spectacular flood damage that we’ve seen inthe Channeled Scablands. That was done by an event orders of magnitude biggerthan anything Lake Missoula could provide. So yes, the lake was dammed by ice inthe Clark Fork valley, just as the gradualists maintain, and yes, that ice damdid break frequently over a period of a few thousand years, say from 15,000years ago down to about 13,000 years ago. But the amount of water released inthese periodic floods was minuscule, just a drop in the bucket compared to thefinal event—in which Lake Missoula was also involved, of course, but definitelynot as the main culprit.”“And that final event had to do with the impact of our comet?” (I’ve startedcalling it “ours,” but it’s usually referred to in the scientific literature asthe “Clovis comet” or the “Younger Dryas comet.”)“You bet,” Randall replies. “But not just one impact. Multiple impacts. I’mguessing as many as four of the fragments—each of them maybe half a mile across,maybe bigger—hit the Cordilleran and Laurentide ice caps in a sort of scattergun effect and caused just a massive amount of instantaneous melting. Themeltwater was everywhere, in enormous quantities. Naturally some of it cascadedinto Lake Missoula, filling it up suddenly and causing it to burst its ice dam,thus adding its contents to the much bigger floods that were already sweepingdown from the north.”“So Lake Missoula was more of an innocent bystander, really, than the culprit.”image [../images/00021.jpeg]Figure 19Randall chuckles. “Yes, that’s right. The lake was the innocent bystander thatwas in the way and that later got accused of the crime. But the comet was theculprit.”Conspiracy cornerI’m no conspiracy theorist but I have a sneaking feeling—nothing more—thatsomething a bit like a conspiracy is at work in science to prevent the properconsideration and wide public uptake of catastrophist ideas. I gave the exampleof J Harlen Bretz in Chapter Three. The frosty and deeply unpleasant receptioninitially given to his findings, the years that he spent in academic limboafterward, the repeated, persistent efforts made by a host of scholars todismiss his evidence entirely, or, failing that, to account for it by gradualistmeans, and then at last, years later, when all that had failed and the notion ofoutburst floods from Glacial Lake Missoula had offered itself as a solution, therealization that he had been right all along. But not right, not right under anycircumstances, not right in any imaginable universe, on the issue of the singlecataclysmic “debacle” that his instincts had originally led him to! If J HarlenBretz was to be right, then it was necessary that he should be right in apolitically correct way—in other words, in a way that could be redacted byskilled uniformitarian spin-meisters to edit out any hint of lurking cosmicdisaster!Indeed, within the fantasy of such a conspiracy (I sincerely hope it is afantasy!) the jökulhlaups idea is an exceptionally useful one. First of all, itprovides what purports to be a wholesomely rational, sober and above all“scientific” account of the tortured geological features witnessed by Bretz inthe Scablands. Secondly, jökulhlaups happen every year in various parts of theworld today, and thus do not violate the commandment that existing processes,acting as at present, must be held sufficient to account for all geologicalchanges. Thirdly, present relevance can be assigned. The Ice Age floods need notbe simply of scholarly interest; since jökulhlaups still occur in thetwenty-first century, science can be brought to bear to anticipate andameliorate their effects.All of this might start to look like a very effective diversion from the truth,if the truth is that a cataclysm, a single, prodigious cataclysm, did occur atthe end of the Ice Age …And might furthermore recur.What, in other words, if the Ojibwa prophecy is true?What if the star with the long, wide tail is, indeed, “going to destroy theworld some day when it comes low again?”Would those who know this benefit from sharing their knowledge with others? Ormight they think it served their interests better to keep quiet about the wholething?We’ll return to this in Chapter Nineteen. By comparison, the question we have toask and answer first is much simpler.Was the Younger Dryas cold event that began so suddenly and so mysteriously12,800 years ago brought on by the effects of a large comet hitting the earth?The evidence for the comet“The Younger Dryas (YD) impact hypothesis,” as its proponents restated it in akeynote paper in The Journal of Geology in September 2014, “proposes that amajor cosmic impact event occurred at the Younger Dryas Boundary (YDB) 12,800years ago.”3 [part0112.html#chapter5-3] The paper, as we will see, presented amass of new evidence in support of the hypothesis—in particular confirming andgreatly extending earlier evidence of the copious presence of nanodiamonds insamples from the Younger Dryas Boundary layer taken in many different countries.Nanodiamonds are microscopic diamonds that form under rare conditions of greatshock, pressure and heat, and are recognized as being among the characteristicfingerprints—“proxies” in scientific language—of powerful impacts by comets orasteroids.4 [part0112.html#chapter5-4]By 2014 when the Journal of Geology paper was published, debate over whether ornot a comet impact was involved in setting off the Younger Dryas had been ragingfor seven years. The first headline that caught my eye was in New Scientistmagazine of May 22, 2007 and asked provocatively:DID A COMET WIPE OUT PREHISTORIC AMERICANS?At that time, 2007, I was taking a break from the lost civilization mystery thathad absorbed my energies, and been the subject of so many of my books, for solong. The New Scientist article tweaked my curiosity, however, because itreferred to the exact epoch that I had focused on in my books. The articledidn’t speak of a lost civilization, but began with a reference to the so-called“Clovis” culture of North America which, as we saw in Chapter Three, vanishedfrom the archaeological record during the Younger Dryas between 12,800 and11,600 years ago. “The Clovis people,” the article observed:flourishing some 13,000 years ago, had a mastery of stone weaponry that stoodthem in good stead against the constant threat of large carnivores, such asAmerican lions and giant short-faced bears. It’s unlikely, however, that theythought death would come from the sky.According to results presented by a team of 25 researchers this week at theAmerican Geophysical Union meeting in Acapulco, Mexico, that’s where the Clovispeople’s doom came from. Citing several lines of evidence, the team suggeststhat a wayward comet hurtled into earth’s atmosphere around 12,900 years ago[N.B. that date would later be revised downward by a hundred years to 12,800years ago], fractured into pieces and exploded in giant fireballs. Debris seemsto have settled as far afield as Europe.5 [part0112.html#chapter5-5]As I read on, I learned that the team the article was referring to was composedof highly credentialed and eminently respectable mainstream scientists:Jim Kennett, an oceanographer at the University of California, Santa Barbara,and one of the team’s three principal investigators, claims immense wildfiresscorched North America in the aftermath, killing large populations of mammalsand bringing an abrupt end to the Clovis culture. “The entire continent was onfire,” he says.Lead team member Richard Firestone, a nuclear analytical chemist at the LawrenceBerkeley National Laboratory in California, says the evidence lies in a narrow12,900-year-old carbon-rich layer of sediment found at eight well-datedClovis-era sites and a peppering of sediment cores across North America, as wellas one site in Belgium.6 [part0112.html#chapter5-6]Probed as to why no crater had yet been identified with this hypothetical impact12,900 years ago, a third team member, Arizona-based geophysicist Allen West,suggested that smaller, low-density parts of the comet would have exploded inthe atmosphere, while larger fragments might have crashed into the two-mile deepice cap that covered North America at that time. “Such craters,” West observed,“would have been ice-walled and basically melted away at the end of the last iceage,” leaving few traces.7 [part0112.html#chapter5-7]The article went on to explain that the sediment samples the team’s evidencefocused on contained several different types of debris that could only have comefrom an extraterrestrial source, such as a comet or an asteroid. As well asnanodiamonds, the debris included tiny carbon spherules that form when moltendroplets cool rapidly in air, and carbon molecules containing the rare isotopehelium-3, far more abundant in the cosmos than on earth.8[part0112.html#chapter5-8]“You might find some other explanation for these individually,” says Firestone,“but taken together, it’s pretty clear that there was an impact.” The team saysthe agent of destruction was probably a comet, since the key sediment layerlacks both the high nickel and iridium levels characteristic of asteroidimpacts.9 [part0112.html#chapter5-9]Last but not least, the New Scientist article confirmed, all the evidencepointed to North America as the epicenter of the disaster:Levels of the apparent extraterrestrial debris, for example, are highest at theGainey archaeological site in Michigan, just beyond the southern reach of NorthAmerica’s primary ice sheet 12,900 years ago. Moreover, levels decrease thefurther you go from Gainey, suggesting that the comet blew up largely overCanada …10 [part0112.html#chapter5-10]In other words, largely over the ice cap that covered the northern half of NorthAmerica during the Ice Age—the source of all the meltwater that scarred andhacked the Scablands of Washington State in “Bretz’s flood” (whether or not thatmeltwater came exclusively from Lake Missoula or gushed forth in far largerquantities than Lake Missoula, alone, could ever have held). Bretz himself, aswe’ve seen, was forced to abandon his own strong intuition that there had been asingle, massive meltwater flood in favor of multiple flushings of limitedamounts of meltwater out of Lake Missoula again and again over thousands ofyears.The primary reason he embraced this theory, however, was not that he had becomea convert to gradualism, but because he was never able to explain how a largeenough area of the ice cap to supply all the vast amounts of water needed forhis flood could simply have melted all at once. He had proposed twopossibilities—dramatic overnight global warming on the one hand, or volcanicactivity under the ice cap on the other—but, as the reader will recall, he veryquickly conceded there was no evidence for either. What Bretz did not consider,and could not consider—because the supporting evidence only began to come in aquarter of a century after his death—was the possibility that the ice cap couldhave undergone cataclysmic melting as a result of a comet impact.If only Bretz had known …A few months after the article appeared in New Scientist, the “Clovis comet”team published a detailed paper on their findings. It appeared in theprestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) on October 9,2007. Despite the sober setting, the headline was dramatic:EVIDENCE FOR AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL IMPACT 12,900 YEARS AGOTHAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE MEGAFAUNAL EXTINCTIONSAND THE YOUNGER DRYAS COOLINGA carbon-rich layer, summarized the team:dating to around 12,900 years ago, has been previously identified at Clovis-agesites across North America and appears contemporaneous with the abrupt onset ofthe Younger Dryas (YD) cooling. The in situ bones of extinct Pleistocenemegafauna, along with Clovis tool assemblages, occur below this black layer butnot within or above it. Causes for the extinctions, YD cooling, and terminationof Clovis culture have long been controversial. In this paper, we provideevidence for an extraterrestrial (ET) impact event close to 12,900 years ago,which we hypothesize caused abrupt environmental changes that contributed to YDcooling, major ecological reorganization, broad-scale extinctions, and rapidhuman behavioral shifts at the end of the Clovis Period. Clovis-age sites inNorth America are overlain by a thin, discrete layer with varying peakabundances of (i) magnetic grains with iridium, (ii) magnetic microspherules,(iii) charcoal, (iv) soot, (v) carbon spherules, (vi) glass-like carboncontaining nanodiamonds, and (vii) fullerenes with ET helium, all of which areevidence for an ET impact and associated biomass burning circa 12,900 yearsago … We propose that one or more large, low-density ET objects exploded overnorthern North America, partially destabilizing the Laurentide Ice Sheet andtriggering YD cooling. The shock wave, thermal pulse, and event-relatedenvironmental effects (e.g., extensive biomass burning and food limitations)contributed to megafaunal extinctions …11 [part0112.html#chapter5-11]Nor were the mammoths, mastodons, ground sloths, horses, camels, giant beaverand other megafauna alone. In total, it is particularly striking that no lessthan thirty-five genera of mammals (with each genus consisting of severalspecies) became extinct in North America between 12,900 and 11,600 years ago,i.e. precisely during the mysterious Younger Dryas cold event.12[part0112.html#chapter5-12] What was now emerging, therefore, was an explanationboth for the sudden onset of the Younger Dryas itself and for the accompanyingextinctions, and perhaps for much else besides—including the cataclysmicflooding that left its marks on the Channeled Scablands of Washington State.This seemed all the more plausible when I learned that Firestone, Kennett andWest’s proposal for their comet was that it was a conglomeration of impactorsincluding one that might have been as much as 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) indiameter.13 [part0112.html#chapter5-13] Furthermore, that 4-kilometer objectwould itself have been just one among multiple fragments resulting from theearlier disintegration—while still in orbit—of a giant comet up to 100kilometers or more in diameter.14 [part0112.html#chapter5-14] Many of thefragments of the parent comet (including some of great size as we’ll see inChapter Nineteen) remained in orbit. Those that hit the earth at the onset ofthe Younger Dryas underwent further explosive fragmentation (accompanied bypowerful airbursts that would themselves have had cataclysmic effects), as theyentered the atmosphere over Canada.Nonetheless, the authors thought it likely that a number of large impactors, upto 2 kilometers in diameter, would have remained intact to collide with the icecap.15 [part0112.html#chapter5-15] There, as West had earlier told NewScientist, any craters would have been transient, leaving few permanent traceson the ground after the ice had melted. “Lasting evidence,” the PNAS paperadded, “may have been limited to enigmatic depressions or disturbances in theCanadian Shield, e.g. under the Great Lakes, or Hudson Bay.”16[part0112.html#chapter5-16]Summarizing the damage, the authors envisaged:a devastating, high-temperature shock wave with extreme overpressure, followedby underpressure, resulting in intense winds traveling across North America athundreds of kilometers an hour, accompanied by powerful, impact-generatedvortices. In addition, whether single or multiple objects collided with theearth, a hot fireball would have immersed the region near the impacts … Atgreater distances the re-entry of high-speed, superheated ejecta would haveinduced extreme wildfires which would have decimated forests and grasslands,destroying the food supplies of herbivores and producing charcoal, soot, toxicfumes and ash.17 [part0112.html#chapter5-17]And how might all this have caused the dramatic cooling of the Younger Dryas?The authors offered many mechanisms operating together, among the most prominentof these being the huge plume of water vapor from the melted ice cap that wouldhave been cast into the upper atmosphere, combined with immense quantities ofdust and debris “composed of the impactor, ice-sheet detritus, and theunderlying crust” as well as the smoke and soot from continent-wide wildfires.18[part0112.html#chapter5-18] Taken in sum, it’s quite easy to understand how somuch lofted debris could, as the authors propose, “have led to cooling byblockage of sunlight”; meanwhile the water vapor, smoke, soot and ice would havepromoted the growth of “persistent cloudiness and noctilucent clouds, leading toreduced sunlight and surface cooling … [thus reducing] the solar insolation athigh latitudes, increasing snow accumulation and causing further cooling in thefeedback loop.”19 [part0112.html#chapter5-19]Severe and devastating enough in themselves, these factors nonetheless pale intoinsignificance when compared with the consequences of the hypothesized impactson the ice cap:The largest potential effect would have been impact-related partialdestabilization and/or melting of the ice sheet. In the short term this wouldhave suddenly released meltwater and rafts of ice into the North Atlantic andArctic Oceans, lowering ocean salinity with consequent surface cooling. Thelonger-term cooling effects would have resulted largely from the consequentweakening of thermohaline circulation in the northern Atlantic, sustaining YDcooling for [more than] 1,000 years until the feedback mechanisms restored oceancirculation.20 [part0112.html#chapter5-20]Impact-related partial destabilization and/or melting of the ice sheet! And on ascale capable of disrupting the circulation of the world’s oceans for more thana thousand years! This matter of thermohaline circulation is an important onethat requires explanation. We will return to it. But what most struck me in theparagraph quoted above was that the authors had only considered the consequencesof the huge quantities of icebergs and meltwater dumped into the oceans northand east of the epicenter of their proposed comet impacts. They did not considerthe effects of that gigantic icy flood on the lands lying immediately south ofthe ice cap—which most certainly would not have been spared.Once again I found myself wondering how J Harlen Bretz might have reacted ifinformation about a possible comet impact had been at his disposal during hislifetime. I cannot prove it, of course, but I think he would have been much lesslikely to be seduced by Lake Missoula gradualism and much more likely—now that acredible heat source had been provided—to stick to his catastrophist guns. Asingle, cataclysmic meltwater flood on a truly gigantic scale coming directlyoff the ice cap to scour the Scablands begins to look very feasible indeed inthe light of the case made by Firestone, West, Kennett and the large team ofscientists working with them.Meanwhile my own hypothesis of an advanced civilization of prehistoric antiquityobliterated from the face of the earth during the Younger Dryas “window” is alsostrengthened by their work. For if their calculations are correct the explosivepower of the Younger Dryas comet would have been of the order of ten millionmegatons.21 [part0112.html#chapter5-21] That makes it two million times greaterin its effects than the former USSR’s Tsar Bomba, the largest nuclear weaponever tested,22 [part0112.html#chapter5-22] and a thousand times greater than theestimated explosive power (10,000 megatons) of all nuclear devices stockpiled inthe world today.23 [part0112.html#chapter5-23] A global disaster of suchmagnitude at exactly the time I suggested in Fingerprints of the Gods does notprove the existence of a lost civilization of the Ice Age but does at leastprovide us with a mechanism large enough—if such a civilization did exist—tohave obliterated it almost entirely from human memory.The evidence continues to mountBecause it has such important ramifications for almost everything we think weknow about the safety and security of the earth’s cosmic environment, and aboutour own past, it is reasonable to ask how solid the Younger Dryas comet impacttheory really is. Since 2007, when it was first proposed, how has it stood up toscientific scrutiny and what new evidence has been brought forward in support ofit?The answer is that it has stood the test of time well and benefited from asteady accumulation of new evidence set out in the proper way in the scientificliterature and subject to rigorous peer review. There is neither space nor need,here, to explore this extensive literature in depth, but to give the generalpicture I will list the dates and titles of a few of the more important papers,with brief summaries of the conclusions and full references in the footnotes:2008: Wildfire and abrupt ecosystem disruption on California’s Northern ChannelIslands at the Allerod-Younger Dryas Boundary. Evidence for ecosystem disruptionat 13,000 to 12,900 years ago on these offshore islands is consistent with theYounger Dryas Boundary cosmic impact hypothesis.24 [part0112.html#chapter5-24]2009: Shock-synthesized hexagonal diamonds in Younger Dryas Boundary sediments.The presence of shock-synthesized hexagonal and other nanometer-sized diamondsin YDB sediments in association with soot and other wildfire indicators isconsistent with a cosmic impact at 12,900 years ago, and the hypothesis that theearth crossed paths with a swarm of comets or carbonaceous chondrites producingairshocks and/or surface impacts that contributed to abrupt ecosystem disruptionand megafaunal extinctions in North America.25 [part0112.html#chapter5-25]2010: Discovery of a nanodiamond-rich layer in the Greenland ice sheet. Thepresence of rounded nanodiamonds and lonsdaleite in Greenland ice suggests thata large cosmic impact occurred … The existence of this layer … appearsconsistent with the occurrence of a major impact event that correlates with thenanodiamond-rich YDB in North America at 12,900 years ago.26[part0112.html#chapter5-26]2010: Palaeolithic extinctions and the Taurid Complex. Intersection with thedebris of a large (50–100 km) short-period comet during the Upper Palaeolithicprovides a satisfactory explanation for the catastrophe of celestial originwhich has been postulated to have occurred around 12,900 years ago and whichpresaged a return to Ice Age conditions of about 1,300 years duration. TheTaurid Complex appears to be the debris of this erstwhile comet; it includesabout 19 of the brightest near-earth objects.27 [part0112.html#chapter5-27][N.B. The implications of this important paper by astronomer Bill Napier of theCenter for Astrobiology at the University of Cardiff, Wales, UK, will beconsidered in greater detail in Chapter Nineteen.]2010: Evidence for a Cosmogenic Origin of fired glaciofluvial beds in theNorthwestern Andes: Correlation with Experimentally Heated Quartz and Feldspar.Fired sediment, considered equivalent to the “Black Mat” impact of 12,900 yearsago, has been located and analyzed in the Andes of Northwestern Venezuela. The“Black Mat” refers to possible fallout from the Encke Comet airburst presumed tohave occurred over the Laurentide Ice Sheet, the impact spreading ejecta overlarge portions of North America and Europe, making it an interhemispheric eventof considerable magnitude … The presence of copious monazite in the carbonaceouscoatings is considered part of the incoming ejecta, as it is not a commonindicator mineral in the local lithology … The intergrowth of carbonaceous“black mat” material with thermally disrupted and fragmented quartz andfeldspar, a “welded” patina of 100–400nm thickness, could only occur withtemperatures in excess of 900 degrees centigrade, the event here interpreted tobe of cosmogenic origin.28 [part0112.html#chapter5-28]2011: Framboidal iron oxide: Chondrite-like material from the black mat, MurraySprings, Arizona. At the end of the Pleistocene a Younger Dryas “black mat” wasdeposited on top of the Pleistocene sediments in many parts of North America. Astudy of the magnetic fraction from the basal section of the black mat at MurraySprings, AZ, revealed the presence of amorphous iron-oxide framboids in a glassyiron-silica matrix. [Our] data suggest that the observed textures are … due … toa shock event that fractured and largely amorphized the grains … Therefore, weargue that these particles are the product of a hypervelocity impact event.29[part0112.html#chapter5-29]2012: Evidence from central Mexico supporting the Younger Dryas extraterrestrialimpact hypothesis. We report the discovery in Lake Cuitzeo in central Mexico ofa black, carbon-rich lacustrine layer, containing nanodiamonds, microspherules,and other unusual materials that date to the early Younger Dryas … We … find theevidence cannot be explained by any known terrestrial mechanism. It is, however,consistent with the Younger Dryas boundary impact hypothesis postulating a majorextraterrestrial impact involving multiple airbursts and/or ground impacts at12,900 years ago.30 [part0112.html#chapter5-30]2012: Very high-temperature impact melt products as evidence for cosmicairbursts and impacts 12,900 years ago. We examined sediment sequences from 18dated Younger Dryas boundary (YDB) sites across three continents … All sitesdisplay abundant microspherules in the YDB with none or few above and below. Inaddition, three sites … display vesicular, high-temperature siliceousscoria-like objects, or SLOs, that match the spherules geochemically … Ourobservations indicate that YDB objects are similar to material produced innuclear airbursts, impact crater plumes and cosmic airbursts, and stronglysupport the hypothesis of multiple cosmic airbursts/impacts at 12,900 years ago.Data presented here require that thermal radiation from air shocks wassufficient to melt surface sediments at temperatures up to or greater than theboiling point of quartz (2,200 degrees centigrade).31[part0112.html#chapter5-31]2013: Large Pt anomaly in the Greenland ice core points to a cataclysm at theonset of Younger Dryas. One explanation of the abrupt cooling episode known asthe Younger Dryas (YD) is a cosmic impact or airburst at the YD boundary thattriggered cooling and resulted in other calamities. We tested the YD impacthypothesis by analyzing ice samples from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2(GISP2) ice core across the Bolling-Allerod/YD boundary for major and traceelements. We found a large platinum (Pt) anomaly at the YDB … Circumstantialevidence hints at an extraterrestrial source … [perhaps] a metal impactor withan unusual composition …32 [part0112.html#chapter5-32]2013: New Evidence from a Black Mat Site in the Northern Andes Supporting aCosmic Impact 12,800 years ago. The spherules from Venezuela are morphologicallyand compositionally identical to YDB spherules documented elsewhere … on threecontinents, North America, Europe and Asia, confirming the YDB magnetic spheruleresults of previous researchers. Their microstructural texturing indicates theyformed from melting and rapid quenching … Thus the most likely origin of thespherules seems to be by cosmic impact/airburst 12,800 years ago withinterhemispheric consequences. The site in Venezuela, along with one in Peru,are the two southernmost sites currently known to display evidence for the YDBimpact event, and these sites represent the first evidence that the effects ofthe impact event extended into South America, even into the SouthernHemisphere.33 [part0112.html#chapter5-33]2014: Nanodiamond-Rich Layer across Three Continents Consistent with MajorCosmic Impact at 12,800 Cal BP. A major cosmic-impact event has been proposed atthe onset of the Younger Dryas cooling episode at 12,800 years (plus or minus150 years) before the present, forming the Younger Dryas Boundary (YDB) Layerdistributed across up to 50 million square kilometers on four continents. In 24dated stratigraphic sections in 10 countries of the Northern Hemisphere, the YDBlayer contains a clearly-defined abundance peak in nanodiamonds (NDs), a majorcosmic impact proxy … The large body of evidence now obtained about YDB NDs isstrongly consistent with an origin by cosmic impact around 12,800 years ago andis inconsistent with formation of YDB ND by natural terrestrial processes,including wildfires, anthropogenesis, and/or influx of cosmic dust.34[part0112.html#chapter5-34] [NB. This paper and its important implications willbe discussed in more detail later in this chapter.]Taking on the dogmatic uniformitariansOne would have thought, with such an impressive accumulation of evidence, thatthe Younger Dryas impact theory would, by now, be fully accepted and thatresearchers would have moved on to a broader consideration of the implicationsof such a recent and hitherto unsuspected global cataclysm for our understandingof the history of the earth and of our own species. However, we’ve already seenfrom the example of J Harlen Bretz how scientists wedded to the uniformitarianand gradualist reference frame react with extreme negative force tocatastrophist theories.Nor was Bretz an exception. Alfred Wegener, who first proposed the notion ofcontinental drift—plate tectonics—was similarly pilloried, as, subsequently,were Luis and Walter Alvarez (the Chicxulub, “K-T” impact), Steven J. Gould(punctuated equilibrium), Victor Clube and Bill Napier (coherent catastrophism),and James Lovelock, Sherwood Rowland, Mario Molina and Lynn Margulis for theircontributions to geophysiology and the Gaia theory. It should come as nosurprise, therefore, that Richard Firestone, Allen West, James Kennett andothers who have followed the evidence and stuck their necks out to suggest thata comet impact caused the Younger Dryas have also come under sustained andbitter attack.Indeed the triumphant crowing of critics who clearly believe they have doneaway, once and for all, with the heretical catastrophism of Firestone, West andKennett, has filled the academic air several times in the past few years. Oneach occasion you can almost hear the collective sigh of relief as if to say“thank God; we finally got those bastards”; but then a few months later comesthe devastating and absolutely convincing refutation that forces the criticsback to the drawing board. This is why eight years of sustained attacks haveonly served to prove—again and again—that the science behind the theory of theYounger Dryas comet is good.It’s quite noticeable, reviewing the literature, that academics form themselvesinto gangs. The ringleaders in the “anti-YD-comet” camp, whose names appearfrequently at the top of critical articles, include Mark Boslough, a physiciston the technical staff of Sandia National Laboratories, and Nicholas Pinter, ageology professor at Southern Illinois University. In 2012 they teamed up withhalf a dozen other scientists to publish a paper entitled “Arguments andEvidence Against a Younger Dryas Impact Event.”35 [part0112.html#chapter5-35]And a year earlier Pinter and some of the authors of the 2012 attack had joinedforces to write a paper hubristically entitled “The Younger Dryas ImpactHypothesis: A Requiem.”36 [part0112.html#chapter5-36]To paraphrase Mark Twain, reports of the death of the comet theory had beengreatly exaggerated.For example one of the key critiques made by Boslough et al in their 2012article was that:Magnetic microspherule abundance results published by the impact proponents havenot been reproducible by other workers. Analyses of the same YD sitestratigraphy by Surovell et al [2009] could not replicate observations for twoof the impact markers published by Firestone et al [2007]. The study by Surovellet al [2009] found no peaks of abundance unique to the YD time interval.37[part0112.html#chapter5-37]But the impact proponents were later able to show that Boslough and hisco-authors “neglected to cite nine independent spherule studies on twocontinents that reported finding significant YDB [Younger Dryas Boundary]spherule abundances.”38 [part0112.html#chapter5-38] More damning, though, wasthe fact that when other scientists repeated the analysis of Surovell et al,their findings did indeed support an impact. The scientists concluded that:the inability of Surovell et al to find YDB spherule peaks resulted from notadhering to the prescribed extraction protocol. For example, Surovell et al didnot conduct any analyses using scanning electron microscopy, a necessaryprocedure clearly specified by Firestone et al.39 [part0112.html#chapter5-39]A separate independent study by Malcolm A. Le Compte et al noted that Surovellet al “collected and analyzed samples from seven YDB sites, purportedly usingthe same protocol as Firestone et al, but did not find a single spherule in YDBsediments at two previously reported sites.”40 [part0112.html#chapter5-40]LeCompte et al set out to examine this discrepancy. After a thoroughinvestigation of all the evidence their results cast the work of Surovell et alinto an even deeper shadow:We conducted an independent blind investigation of two sites common to bothstudies, and a third site investigated only by Surovell et al. We found abundantYDB microspherules at all three widely separated sites consistent with theresults of Firestone et al and conclude that the analytical protocol employed bySurovell et al deviated significantly from that of Firestone et al.Morphological and geochemical analysis of YDB spherules suggest they … formedfrom abrupt melting and quenching of terrestrial materials and … are consistentwith … a previously proposed cosmic impact 12,900 years ago …41[part0112.html#chapter5-41]Unsurprisingly, after all this, Pinter’s “requiem” for the Younger Dryas impacthypothesis turned out to have been premature:Pinter et al claimed to have sampled the YDB layer at a location “identical ornearly identical” with the location reported by Kennett et al, as part of threestudies that reported finding no YDB spherules or nanodiamonds. However, thepublished Universal Transverse Mercator coordinates reveal that their purportedcontinuous sequence is actually four discontinuous sections. These locationsrange in distance from the site investigated by Kennett et al by 7,000 m, 1,600m, 165 m, and 30 m, clearly showing that they did not sample the YDB site ofKennett et al. Furthermore, this sampling strategy raises questions aboutwhether Pinter et al sampled the YDB at all, and may explain why they wereunable to find peaks in YDB magnetic spherules, carbon spherules, ornanodiamonds.42 [part0112.html#chapter5-42]In 2012–13, in an effort to limit the scope for poor or misleading scholarshipto be cited as though it discredits their work—when in fact it does no suchthing—Jim Kennett, Richard Firestone, Allen West and a formidable group ofpro-impact scientists launched “one of the most comprehensive investigations ofspherules ever undertaken.”43 [part0112.html#chapter5-43] The investigationfocused on eighteen sites across North America, Europe and the Middle East (thelatter represented by Abu Hureyra in Syria), and conducted more than 700analyses on spherules using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy for chemicalanalysis and scanning electron microscopy for surface microstructuralcharacterization.The results, published in PNAS on June 4, 2013, took advantage of recentadvances in radiocarbon technology to refine the date of the Younger Dryasimpact from 12,900 to 12,800 years ago44 [part0112.html#chapter5-44] and enableda much more detailed map of the YDB field to be drawn up, covering close to 50million square kilometers of North, Central and South America, a large segmentof the Atlantic Ocean, and most of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.Calculations indicate that the impact deposited around ten million tons ofspherules across this vast strewnfield.45 [part0112.html#chapter5-45] Nor wasthere any doubt in the researchers’ minds that an impact had been at the heartof the matter:The analyses of 771 YDB objects presented in this paper strongly support a majorcosmic impact at 12,800 years ago … Spherules … are (i) widespread at 18 siteson four continents; (ii) display large abundance peaks only at the YD onset ataround 12,800 years ago; (iii) are rarely found above or below the YDB,indicating a rare event; and (iv) amount to an estimated 10 million tons ofmaterials distributed across around 50 million square kilometers of severalcontinents, thus precluding a small, local event.46 [part0112.html#chapter5-46]Despite the annoying ability of the Younger Dryas comet to keep on provingitself, and of its proponents to keep on refuting all attacks, Nicholas Pinter,lead author of the 2011 “Requiem” paper, felt moved in an interview with NBCNews in September 2013 once again to attempt to cast the hypothesis intoscientific limbo. “My only comment,” he said, “is that the pro-impact literatureis, at this point, fringe science being promoted by a single journal.”47[part0112.html#chapter5-47]A number of observers with no particular axe of their own to grind were puzzledby this remark. First of all, as National Geographic correspondent Robert Kunzignoted, it smacked a little of wishful thinking, even desperation, on Pinter’spart. “Some opponents of the hypothesis,” wrote Kunzig, “want so badly for it togo away that they have attempted to declare it dead.”48[part0112.html#chapter5-48] Secondly, the journal that Pinter accused ofpromoting fringe science was none other than the revered, utterly mainstream,and extensively peer-reviewed Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences(PNAS).49 [part0112.html#chapter5-49] Thirdly, although a number of articles byKennett, West, Firestone and their team have appeared in PNAS, it is simply nottrue to suggest that PNAS is promoting their cause. On the contrary, at the timePinter blurted out his protest to NBC the critics of the YD comet hypothesis hadpublished ten times in PNAS, whereas the proponents of the hypothesis hadpublished there only eight times. Likewise Pinter’s claim that the hypothesis isonly being presented in a single journal could hardly be more wrong. BySeptember 2013, in addition to their eight papers in PNAS, proponents hadpublished no less than fifteen papers in thirteen other journals.50[part0112.html#chapter5-50]The scholarly fight over the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis is far from over.At the time of writing, the most recent salvo fired by critics of the hypothesiswas entitled “Anthropogenic origin of siliceous scoria droplets from Pleistoceneand Holocene archaeological sites in northern Syria.” Authored by P. Thy, G.Willcox, G.H. Barfod and D.Q. Fuller, it was published online on December 16,2014 and in print in January 2015 in the Journal of Archaeological Science.51[part0112.html#chapter5-51] The essence of the argument in this paper is thatsiliceous scoria droplets (composed mostly of glass matrix and bubbles togetherwith partially melted mineral grains) from Abu Hureyra in Syria—cited bypro-impact scientists as evidence for their case—were nothing to do with thecomet but were instead a product of ancient buildings destroyed by house fires:We therefore conclude that melting of building earth in ancient settlements canoccur during fires reaching modest temperatures. There is no evidence to suggestthat siliceous scoria droplets result from very high temperature melting of soiland are the result of a cosmic event.52 [part0112.html#chapter5-52]“For the Syria site the impact theory is out,” boasted lead author Peter Thy ina press interview headlined “Study Casts Doubt on Mammoth-Killing CosmicImpact.”53 [part0112.html#chapter5-53] But once again it seems the bluster waspremature. Allen West is listed as the corresponding author on the majority ofscholarly papers published by the team of scientists working on the YoungerDryas impact, so I emailed him on March 18, 2015 to ask if he and his colleagueshad any response to the critique by Thy et al. West replied as follows:We agree with Thy et al that hut fires can produce glass, but it does notfollow, therefore, that all glass comes from hut fires, as they conclude. Wehave analyzed natural glasses supplied by one of the authors of that study, andthe 12,800-year-old glass from Syria is only superficially similar. Instead itmatches known cosmic impact glass, as well as high-temperature atomic bombglass.Most importantly, those authors did not discuss or look for the evidence ofabundant high-temperature minerals presented in our previous papers on threesites on two continents (Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Syria) where we foundsuessite that melts at around 2,300 degrees centigrade and corundum at around1,800 degrees centigrade. Now we have even stronger evidence from the Syriansite and are working on a new paper to be published this year. The12,800-year-old Syrian glass contains a range of minerals that melted atextraordinarily high temperatures. See the table below from our new paper:image [../images/00022.jpeg]Those temperatures are sufficient to melt steel. Furthermore the same glass-richlayer at the Syrian site contains large peaks in nanodiamonds, nickel andplatinum. No building fire can duplicate that range of evidence—such fires can’tproduce nanodiamonds or platinum enrichments. All this evidence refutes thehypothesis of Thy et al that this glass was produced in low-temperature buildingfires.54 [part0112.html#chapter5-54]When the new paper by West and his colleagues is published later in 2015 (afterthis book has gone to press), I have no doubt that it will, effectively, refutethe arguments of Thy et al—just as all previous attacks have been successfullyrefuted. But I also have no doubt that others, who for whatever reasons of theirown are philosophically opposed to the notion of a cataclysm 12,800 years ago,will publish yet more so-called “requiems” for the Younger Dryas impacthypothesis in the years ahead, even while the constant discovery of new evidencemeans that it continues to thrive and grow. As we’ve seen throughout this book,catastrophist ideas, no matter how thoroughly documented and persistently arguedand presented they may be, are routinely and regularly brushed under the carpetby the uniformitarian establishment. Thus while he lacked nothing inpersistence, or in the thoroughness of his documentation, J Harlen Bretz facedyears of discouragement before his ideas were welcomed by the mainstream.Jim Kennett, Richard Firestone, Allen West and their colleagues have argued thecatastrophist case for the Younger Dryas comet impact with equally commendablepersistence and with equal mastery of documentation and they, too, have facedrejection and hostility. Two things are different in their case, however. First,this is the twenty-first century and we have the internet, which allows the veryrapid sharing and proliferation of ideas. That was not the case when Bretz beganhis lonely struggle. Secondly, Kennett, Firestone and West seem to have a betterunderstanding of the politics of science than Bretz did and have greatlystrengthened their own hand by mobilizing support for their work from manycolleagues. It is one thing to shout down and silence a lone wolf like Bretz. Itis quite another to shout down and silence a large team of highly credentialedscientists from multiple disciplines and universities.And the team is growing. As I complete this chapter in March 2015, I have beforeme on my desk the latest paper published by Firestone, Kennett and West. Thepaper, entitled “Nanodiamond-Rich Layer across Three Continents Consistent withMajor Cosmic Impact 12,800 Years Ago,” appears in the September 2014 issue ofThe Journal of Geology. The lead author is Carles R. Kinzie of the Department ofChemistry, DePaul University, Chicago. Firestone, Kennett, West and twenty-twoother leading scientists from prestigious universities and research institutesaround the world are co-authors.55 [part0112.html#chapter5-55] The gravity ofthe paper, of its authors and of the journal in which it appears, together withthe further detailed refutations it contains of prior critiques,56[part0112.html#chapter5-56] combine to make a laughing stock of NicholasPinter’s claim that the Younger Dryas comet hypothesis is “fringe science.”Indeed, the contrary is true—what is clearly happening is that an extraordinaryhypothesis has again and again met the demand for extraordinary evidence tosupport it and has begun to force its way through the staunchly-defended doorsof the mainstream. It will not be an easy struggle; it never is. There will besetbacks as well as progress. But the 2013 paper on spherules and the 2014 paperon nanodiamonds contain a wealth of evidence that even the most hardenedgradualists must find hard to dismiss entirely. As Wallace Broecker, ageochemist and climate scientist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty EarthObservatory, recently begrudgingly admitted: “Most people were trying todisprove this. Now they’re going to have to realize there’s some truth to it.”57[part0112.html#chapter5-57]But there cannot be just “some” truth to it. The Younger Dryas comet hypothesisis either right or wrong. My own assessment, having pored through more thanseven years of research papers and having read every attack and refutation sincethe first public airing of the hypothesis in 2007, is that the case for theimpact is a very strong one that grows stronger and more convincing every day. Icould give many further examples of the successful efforts by the proponents ofthe hypothesis to defend their ideas over the years, but rather than doing sohere, I refer the interested reader to the sources given in the footnote.58[part0112.html#chapter5-58]Meanwhile the September 2014 paper, summarizing the evidence presented,concludes:A cosmic impact event at the onset of the Younger Dryas cooling episode is theonly hypothesis capable of explaining the simultaneous deposition of peakabundances in nanodiamonds, magnetic and glassy spherules, melt-glass, platinumand/or other proxies across at least four continents (approaching 50 millionsquare kilometers). The evidence strongly supports a cosmic impact 12,800 yearsago.59 [part0112.html#chapter5-59]Of particular note, adds James Kennett, is the fact that the glassy and metallicmaterials in the YDB layers could only have formed at temperatures in excess of2,200 degrees Celsius and therefore could not have resulted from any alternativescenario other than a massive comet impact.60 [part0112.html#chapter5-60]image [../images/00023.jpeg]Figure 20: The Younger Dryas Boundary Strewnfield (after Wittke et al, 2013 andKinzie, Kennett et al, 2014). The area enclosed by the dotted line defines thecurrent known limits of the YDB field of cosmic-impact proxies spanning 50million square kilometers.The exact size of that impact remains to be resolved with further research.Until then, says Kennett, “There is no known limit to the YDB strewnfield whichcurrently covers more than 10 percent of the planet, indicating that the YDBevent was a major cosmic impact … The nanodiamond datum recognized in this studygives scientists a snapshot of a moment in time called an isochron.”61[part0112.html#chapter5-61]Worldwide, to this day, scientists know of only two layers of sediment “broadlydistributed across several continents that exhibit coeval abundance peaks in acomprehensive assemblage of cosmic impact markers, including nanodiamonds,high-temperature quenched spherules, high-temperature melt-glass, carbonspherules, iridium and aciniform carbon.”62 [part0112.html#chapter5-62] Theselayers are found at the Younger Dryas Boundary 12,800 years ago, and at theCretaceous-Tertiary boundary 65 million years ago, when it has long been agreedthat a gigantic cosmic impact in the Gulf of Mexico (in that case the impactoris thought to have been an asteroid some ten kilometers in diameter) caused themass extinction of the dinosaurs.63 [part0112.html#chapter5-63]“The evidence we present settles the debate about the existence of abundant YDBnanodiamonds,” Kennett says. “Our hypothesis challenges some existing paradigmswithin several disciplines, including impact dynamics, archaeology, paleontologyand paleoceanography/paleoclimatology, all affected by this relatively recentcosmic impact.”64 [part0112.html#chapter5-64]The point Kennett makes here has important implications for the study andunderstanding of our past. Archaeologists have been in the habit of regardingcosmic impacts, supposedly only occurring at multi-million year intervals, aslargely irrelevant to the 200,000-year story of anatomically modern humans. Whenwe believed that the last big impact had been the dinosaur-killing asteroid of65 million years ago, there was obviously little point in trying to relatecosmic accidents on such an almost unimaginable scale in any way to the muchshorter time-frame of “history.” But the very real possibility confirmed byKennett’s study that a huge, earthshaking, extinction-level event occurred just12,800 years ago, in our historical backyard, changes everything."},{"pageContent":" Chapter 6 [part0131.html#c_ch6]Fingerprints of a Comet [part0131.html#c_ch6]The evidence from deposits of nanodiamonds, microspherules, high-temperaturemelt-glass and other “ET-impact proxies” at the Younger Dryas Boundary pointsstrongly toward a cataclysmic encounter between the earth and a large cometaround 12,800 years ago. The point of entry would have been somewhere overCanada, by which time the comet might already have broken up into multiplefragments on its journey through space (as was the case with CometShoemaker-Levy 9 when its “freight-train” of large fragments hit Jupiter withspectacular effect in 1994). It is equally possible, however, that the break upof the Younger Dryas comet did not occur until after it had entered the earth’satmosphere. Either way, some of the fragments very soon exploded in the air;others, with diameters of up to two kilometers, smashed down at various pointson the North American ice cap, yet others streaked on in a southeasterlydirection across the Atlantic Ocean where further impacts followed on theEuropean ice cap, and still others remained aloft until they reached the MiddleEast in the vicinity of Turkey, Lebanon and Syria, where the final rain ofimpacts occurred.Because the evidence for the comet is so new, and because the impact hypothesisis still disputed, almost no consideration has yet been given to the immediateeffects of the multiple major impacts that are thought to have taken place onthe North American ice cap. In all cases the ice itself, still more than twokilometers thick 12,800 years ago, would have absorbed most of the shock of theimpact leaving very few lasting features on the ground. Even so, researchershave begun to home in on a number of possible craters.One candidate is the so-called Charity Shoal feature in Lake Ontario. Consistingof a raised rim around a small circular basin approximately a kilometer indiameter and 19 meters deep, it was studied by a team of scientists led by TroyHolcombe, who concluded that it was likely to be of extraterrestrial impactorigin and might have been created in the late Pleistocene around the time ofthe onset of the Younger Dryas.1 [part0113.html#chapter6-1]Similarly, the half-kilometer diameter, 10-meter deep Bloody Creek Structure insouthwestern Nova Scotia was identified as a possible impact crater by IanSpooner, George Stevens and others in a 2009 paper in the journal Meteoriticsand Planetary Science. They could not be confident as to its age, but noted that“impact onto glacier ice during the waning stages of the Wisconsin Glaciationabout 12,000 years ago may have resulted in dissipation of much impact energyinto the ice, resulting in the present morphology of the Bloody CreekStructure.”2 [part0113.html#chapter6-2]image [../images/00024.jpeg]Figure 21A third candidate is the Corossol Crater in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, Canada.Discovered by the Canadian Hydrographic Service during underwater mapping,Corossol is 4 kilometers in diameter, implying an impacting object with adiameter of up to half a kilometer. The crater presently lies in 40 to 185meters of water and was originally thought to be very ancient, dating to somepoint after the middle Ordovician, about 470 million years ago.3[part0113.html#chapter6-3] Recent research, however, casts doubt on thischronology. For example, M.D. Higgins and his colleagues from the University ofQuebec and the Geological Survey of Canada argued in a paper presented at the42nd Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in March 2011 that:The paucity of sediments in the crater might be taken to indicate that it isyoung. The minimum age was established using data from a 7 meter core taken inthe central trough. Calibrated carbon-14 ages of shells in the sediments can beextrapolated to give an estimate of the age of the base of the sedimentarysequence of around 12,900 years ago … This is taken to be the youngest possibleage of the impact.4 [part0113.html#chapter6-4]That “youngest possible” age of 12,900 years is comfortably within the margin oferror of 12,800 years plus or minus 150 years that is presently accepted for theYounger Dryas Boundary.5 [part0113.html#chapter6-5] In other words if thefindings of Higgins and his team are confirmed, Corossol could well be one ofthe hitherto “missing” impact craters left by the Younger Dryas comet. Firmidentification of such a crater would be jam on the cake for Firestone, Kennett,West and other pro-impact scientists, but as they have made clear many times,they do not need craters to prove their hypothesis, since prominent craters arenot to be expected either from airbursts or from impacts on ice caps.Nonetheless Charity Shoal, Bloody Creek and Corossol do not stand alone. Afourth possible impact site has been identified somewhat to the west of Corossolin an area known to geologists as the Quebecia Terrain. High concentrations ofYDB microspherules found near the towns of Melrose in Pennsylvania andNewtonville in New Jersey were analyzed by Wu, Sharma, LeCompte, Demitroff andLandis in a paper published in September 2013 in the Proceedings of the NationalAcademy of Sciences. Their conclusion was that an impact on the Laurentide icesheet penetrated to the bedrock of the Quebecia Terrain throwing ejecta highinto the atmosphere. The ejecta included spherules in the range of 2 to 5millimeters in diameter that were spread by the winds and rained down hundredsof miles away in the Melrose–Newtonville area. Significantly the spherulesturned out on analysis to contain:minerals such as suessite that form at temperatures in excess of 2,000 degreescentigrade. Gross texture, mineralogy, and age of the spherules appearconsistent with their formation as ejecta from an impact 12,900 years ago … Therare earth element patterns and Sr and Nd isotopes of the spherules indicatethat their source lies in the Quebecia Terrain.6 [part0113.html#chapter6-6]“We have provided evidence for an impact on top of the ice sheet,” concludedstudy co-author Mukul Sharma. “We have for the first time narrowed down theregion where a Younger Dryas impact did take place, even though we have not yetfound its crater.”7 [part0113.html#chapter6-7]Judging from the apparent northwest to southeast trajectory of the Younger Dryascomet,8 [part0113.html#chapter6-8] the Charity Shoal feature in Lake Ontario,ejecta from Quebecia Terrain, the Corossol crater in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence,and the Bloody Creek structure in Nova Scotia might mark the impacts of the lastlarge fragments to hit North America. But the even larger fragments—in the rangeof two kilometers in diameter that Firestone, Kennett and West envisage—wouldinevitably have hit the ice cap earlier in the trajectory and thus at pointslying further to the north and west. It is to these hypothetical impacts on thewestern fringes of the Laurentide Ice Cap, and on the Cordilleran Ice Cap, thatwe should look for the possible source of the meltwater for Bretz’s flood.Radical thinkingAlthough the notion of outburst floods from Glacial Lake Missoula has long beenaccepted by mainstream science as the source of the spectacular flood damagedocumented by Bretz, it is important to recognize that a number of senior,highly credentialed scientists continue to dissent from this view. Prominentamong the dissenters is John Shaw, Professor of Earth Sciences at the Universityof Alberta in Canada. Shaw argues that the volume of water in Lake Missoula,estimated at around 2,000 cubic kilometers at its peak, is not sufficient toaccount for the field evidence. His own theory is that huge quantities ofmeltwater—of the order of 100,000 cubic kilometers—were impounded in asubglacial reservoir deep beneath the North American ice cap and he proposesthat the flood damage was caused by a single, massive release from thisreservoir.9 [part0113.html#chapter6-9]Japanese researchers Goro Komatsu, Hideyaki Miyamoto, Kazumasa Itoh and HiroyukiTosaka have carried out extensive computer simulations of large-scalecataclysmic floods across the Scablands and agree with Shaw that Glacial LakeMissoula was not, on its own, anywhere near large enough to account for theflood damage:Even the whole draining of Lake Missoula cannot explain the field evidence ofhigh water marks … The subglacial flooding from the north proposed by Shaw mayprovide an explanation for the increased volume of water required to explain thehigh water-mark evidence in the Channeled Scabland.10[part0113.html#chapter6-10]Likewise Victor Baker, Professor of Hydrology and Water Resources at theUniversity of Arizona, and Jim O’Connor of the US Geological Survey’s WaterScience Center have expressed concern about the “case for periodic colossaljökulhlaups” out of Glacial Lake Missoula:In our view, anomalies still exist between some aspects of the field evidenceand the conceptual models that have been advocated. The position that the“scores-of-floods hypothesis completes Bretz’s imaginative theory” (Waitt, 1985,p. 1286) may prematurely divert attention from some of the outstanding problemsthat remain in interpreting the spectacular features of the ChanneledScabland.11 [part0113.html#chapter6-11]In 1977 geologist C. Warren Hunt set out to conduct a detailed investigationinto Bretz’s flood. He did so because, like the scholars cited above, he wasunconvinced by the theory—which had already assumed the status of unassailablefact by the mid-1970s—that all the water damage visible in the Scablands hadbeen caused by outburst floods from Lake Missoula. Hunt’s dissatisfactionstemmed from his own extensive knowledge of dams and how to design them to takebest advantage of local geology. The bottom line, according to his calculations,was that the proposed ice dam on the Clark Fork River, behind which LakeMissoula is supposed to have backed up, would have been, quite literally,impossible.Let us first of all consider the statistics. According to the US GeologicalSurvey, Glacial Lake Missoula at its highest level—the level it is presumed tohave reached before the Clark Fork ice dam broke—covered an area of about 3,000square miles and contained an estimated 500 cubic miles (2,084 cubic kilometers)of water. Its surface would have been at 4,150 feet above sea level, but thebottom terrain varied in altitude from point to point so the USGS calculatesthat the lake would have been about 950 feet deep at present day Missoula, 260feet deep at Darby and around 1,100 feet deep near Polson. At the ice damitself, however, a gradient in the underlying terrain meant the glacial lakewould have been more than 2,000 feet deep (its deepest point—more than twice thedepth of modern Lake Superior).12 [part0113.html#chapter6-12]While broadly concurring with the US Geological Survey’s figures, C. Warren Huntemphatically rejected “the suggestion that ice might have dammed Clark Fork soas to impound water to a depth of 2,100 ft (640 meters) … When one considers,”he wrote:that modern engineering employs bedrock grouting for securing the footings of500-ft (150-m) dams, it must surely strike any reader as virtually frivolous tosuggest that chance emplacement of glacial ice might have dammed Clark Forkacross a 7-mile (11-km) span lacking in intermediate abutments, and thenretained water at four times the pressure of modern engineered concrete dams!13[part0113.html#chapter6-13]Hunt’s incredulity at the notion of an ice dam more than 2,000 feet high and 7miles long receives support from studies which argue that “at a lake depth ofapproximately 200 meters (656 feet), the hydrostatic pressure exerted on thedamming ice is sufficient to begin to force a hole through the ice. Once formedthis hole will enlarge by frictional melt-widening, enabling the drainage ofice-dammed lake water to occur.”14 [part0113.html#chapter6-14]At more than thrice 200 meters in height, therefore, the hypothetical Clark Forkice dam does, indeed, begin to look “impossible.”Yet, as noted, Hunt accepted the USGS statistics. The surface of Lake Missoulacertainly did at one point stand 4,150 feet above sea level and the laketherefore must indeed have reached around 2,100 feet deep in the Clark ForkValley between the Bitteroot and Cabinet mountain ranges. That it did so isconfirmed by an ancient strandline at that altitude, and other strandlines havebeen found at lower altitudes which clearly show many subsequent lower waterlevels after the high one.15 [part0113.html#chapter6-15] Hunt’s solution,however, since he continued to regard the Clark Fork dam as a geologicalimpossibility, was to propose that a gigantic flood, thousands of feet deep,must have washed over the entire region at the end of the Ice Age, in theprocess filling the various basins of Glacial Lake Missoula up to the 4,150 footlevel where the highest strandline is found and leaving the lower strandlines asit receded.16 [part0113.html#chapter6-16]As the source of his proposed region-wide flood, Hunt suggested that:tidal inundation brought on by some form of gravitational attraction from acelestial source, the nature of which is beyond the competence of the writer,must have resulted in a … tide … rising to 5,000 feet (1,600 meters) abovepresent sea level … The waters were held there several weeks … during whichthere was much surging, partial floating of glaciers, and development of thehighest beaches in “Lake Missoula.” The tidal ebb and flood with successivelower beaches developing allowed sweeping of the canyons, removal of previousglacial deposits, fans and talus, scouring of the “Scablands,” ice-rafting,polishing of standing rock obstructions to tidal surge, aggradation of valleyand “by-pass” floors, and discharge of boulders into submarine deltas and fans.Lastly, a layer of silt was left in the wake of the tide, especially in thequieter waters of cul-de-sac estuaries.17 [part0113.html#chapter6-17]In other words, Hunt had very much gone “back to Bretz” in proposing a singlegigantic flood as the source of all the damage on the Columbia Plateau. His 1977notion that it was a tidal inundation of sea-water rushing up estuaries (andbrought on by the gravitational attraction of some hypothetical celestialbody)18 [part0113.html#chapter6-18] is, however, untenable, and Hunt himselfrecognized this when he revisited the subject some years later in his 1990 bookEnvironment of Violence. Conceding that “the tidewater solution is weakened bythe great distance to tidewater and the absence of a trail of evidence along thepossible routes,”19 [part0113.html#chapter6-19] he sought out other possiblesources of water in sufficiently vast quantities to inflict the damage to thelandscape that he had observed in the field. In the process, he brieflyconsidered John Shaw’s theory of a subglacial reservoir of 100,000 cubickilometers of meltwater, but asked some pertinent questions:How could such melting take place without a heat source such as the volcanicheat which precipitates Icelandic jökulhlaups? What climatic regimen would allowsuch melting in the first place? Why would the water not have lifted theperiphery of the ice sheet and emerged without accumulating soon after it wasproduced by melting? What containment mechanism would allow accumulation of agreat under-ice lake … beneath 3,000 meters of ice? And would not water beneaththe maximum ice thickness tend to escape toward the lesser confining pressuresunder peripheral areas of the ice sheet? Is there any possible way such a hugeunder-ice chamber of water could accumulate?20 [part0113.html#chapter6-20]To cut a long story short, Hunt reasoned that there was not. Besides the 100,000cubic kilometers that Shaw’s theory offered was, in his opinion, insufficient.Almost ten times as much water would be needed to account for all the fieldevidence. With a tidal source, Glacial Lake Missoula and Shaw’s under-icereservoir all dismissed, therefore, Hunt found himself left with only onepossible—though startlingly catastrophist—solution. Somehow, in some way, veryrapid, cataclysmic melting of an immense area of the North American ice cap musthave taken place. After doing the necessary calculations Hunt concluded that840,000 cubic kilometers of ice, i.e. about ten percent of the entire glaciatedarea, “would have had to melt.”21 [part0113.html#chapter6-21]The reader will recall that Bretz originally envisaged something similar but wasdefeated by the inability of either radical global warming or sub-glacialvolcanism (quite simply, neither happened) to account for the vast quantities ofmeltwater “his” flood called for. In the end, as we saw, he settled for outburstfloods from Glacial Lake Missoula as the answer. In 1990, Hunt faced the samedilemma—with the exception that he had already ruled out Lake Missoula—butshowed himself to be an extraordinarily competent and prescient innovator when,without any preamble, he wrote:Earth heat cannot have melted continental ice to produce floodwaters in thevolumes required … A cometary heat source could have served the purpose.22[part0113.html#chapter6-22] (Emphasis added.)To melt ten percent of the North American ice cap, Hunt calculated that thekinetic energy of a half-kilometer diameter comet would be sufficient:A comet of the type that exploded above the Tunguska site in 1908 could haveprovided this heat. The great lake it might have created in the middle of theice sheet would rapidly have tunneled under the remaining glacier and emerged ascatastrophic floods in many directions. Cometary melting of the ice seemsnecessary to yield so much water in such a short time.23[part0113.html#chapter6-23] (Emphasis added.)Anticipating the objection that no crater had been found, Hunt pointed out thatthe Tunguska event—an airburst—likewise left no crater or ejecta blanket.Furthermore, in the case of a hypothetical comet impact on the North Americanice cap:all ejecta and cometary matter would likely have been swept away in the ensuingflood, coming to rest widely dispersed in the drift blanket far from its source.Thus diluted and mixed with other debris, direct evidence for either theexploded projectile or ejecta from the site could be difficult to recognize, ifnot lost to science permanently.24 [part0113.html#chapter6-24]Last but not least—and again the prescience is almost eerie!—Hunt noted that“glass spherules if found in glacial debris could support the theory.”25[part0113.html#chapter6-25]He could not have known then, writing a quarter of a century ago, that from 2007onward a team of leading scientists would champion the cause of comet impacts onthe North American ice cap and, in the absence of obvious craters, would derivemuch of their evidence from microspherules, fused glass and nanodiamonds.How to change global climate in an instantHunt’s suggestion was that a single relatively small half-kilometer diameterobject would have packed sufficient kinetic energy to set off the melting ofapproximately one tenth of the North American ice cap, producing a cataclysmicflood. Twenty-five years on, the proponents of the Younger Dryas comethypothesis, as we have seen, are proposing that “multiple two-kilometer” objectsmay have impacted the ice cap.26 [part0113.html#chapter6-26] If they arecorrect, the scale of the ensuing floods must have been almost unimaginablylarge. Nor would they have been confined only to the Channeled Scablands of theColumbia plateau. The comet hypothesis envisages a rain of impacts right acrossthe ice sheet from the Pacific to the Atlantic coasts of North America, so weshould find evidence of flooding everywhere.We do. The Columbia plateau displays flood-ravaged scablands but so too does thestate of New Jersey much farther to the east. The Columbia plateau is notablefor its fields and hillsides strewn with huge ice-rafted erratics but so, too,is the state of New York. Indeed, perched on the bare rock surfaces ofManhattan’s Central Park are many imposing erratic boulders, including diabasefrom the Palisades Sill along the Hudson River and shist from even fartherafield. Interestingly, too, just as the Columbia plateau has its coulees, so NewYork State has its Finger Lakes. These latter were long thought to have beencarved by glaciers but their geomorphology closely parallels that of the couleesand some researchers now believe they were cut by glacial meltwater at extremepressures—a process linked by sediment evidence to “the collapse of continentalice sheets.”27 [part0113.html#chapter6-27]image [../images/00025.jpeg]Figure 22Likewise in Minnesota, on the Saint Croix River where Randall Carlson and Ifinished our long road trip across North America, there is a spectacular arrayof more than eighty giant glacial potholes. One is 10 feet wide and 60 feetdeep, making it the deepest explored pothole in the world. Others, as yetunexcavated, are even wider, suggesting the probability that they may be deeperas well. And all of them, without exception, were carved out by turbulent floodsat the end of the Ice Age—floods emanating, Randall believes, from the superiorlobe of the Laurentide ice cap.“You could spend a lifetime,” he tells me, “traveling this land and still notsee it all. The effects of mega-scale flood flows have been extensivelydocumented in the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains in both Canada andthe US, across the prairie states, in the vicinity of the Great Lakes, inPennsylvania and western New York, and in New England. All the Canadianprovinces preserve large-scale evidence of gigantic water flows. All regionswithin or proximal to the area of the last great glaciation show the effects ofintense, mega-scale floods.”But the question that remains concerns the source of these floods.Having been dragged kicking and screaming into conceding that flooding occurredat all, gradualist science, as we have seen, subsequently engaged in a loveaffair with Glacial Lake Missoula, elevating it and its epic jökulhlaups toserve as the sole explanation for all the astonishing diluvial features of theChanneled Scablands of the Columbia plateau. It is not surprising, therefore,that other Ice Age floods, wherever they are admitted to have occurred, are alsoattributed to jökulhlaups from glacial lakes.More than that, it is the floodwaters from these glacial lakes—rather thananything so vulgarly catastrophist as a comet—that are presently regarded bymainstream science as the most likely cause of the Younger Dryas cold event. Thegiant Glacial Lake Agassiz, which lay across most of Manitoba, northwesternOntario, northern Minnesota, eastern North Dakota and Saskatchewan, isparticularly implicated. Around 13,000 years ago—i.e. immediately before theonset of the Younger Dryas—Lake Agassiz is thought to have covered an area asgreat as 440,000 square kilometers (170,000 square miles) when an ice dam brokeand allowed a substantial fraction of its contents, perhaps as much as 9,500cubic kilometers, to spill out along a flood path running through the MackenzieRiver system in the Canadian Arctic coastal plain, and thence into the ArcticOcean.28 [part0113.html#chapter6-28] There the anticyclonic circulation of acurrent known as the Beaufort Gyre would have gradually moved it onward into thesubpolar North Atlantic in the Transpolar Drift:The slow release of meltwater south through Fram Strait provides a mechanismunique to the Arctic that is capable of turning a short-duration, high-magnitudemeltwater discharge into a significantly longer, more moderated and sustainedmeltwater rerouting event to the North Atlantic.29 [part0113.html#chapter6-29]What made matters worse, however, was that at the same time huge quantities oficy meltwater were also being dumped into the North Atlantic from the otherglacial lakes and directly off the Laurentide ice sheet itself.30[part0113.html#chapter6-30] The combined effect, so the theory goes, disruptedocean circulation to such an extent that it radically affected global climate:A great gush of cold freshwater derived from the melting Laurentide ice sheetswept across the surface of the North Atlantic. It prevented warm, salty waterfrom the southern ocean flowing deep beneath the surface (the Gulf Stream) fromrising to the surface. The normal overturning of the ocean water stopped. As aconsequence the atmosphere over the ocean, which would normally have beenwarmed, remained cold and so, in consequence, did the air over Europe and NorthAmerica.31 [part0113.html#chapter6-31]These are highly technical matters, with which we do not need to concernourselves at too great length here. In brief, though, the Atlantic meridionaloverturning circulation, also known as the thermohaline circulation, is thegreat ocean conveyer belt32 [part0113.html#chapter6-32] that not only carrieswarm salty equatorial water to the surface and thence northward where iteventually cools and sinks off the coasts of Greenland and Norway, but alsocarries the resultant cold North Atlantic deep water south, returning it slowlyto the equator where it mixes with warmer water, rises again to the surface andthus continues the cycle:It transports large amounts of water, heat, salt, carbon, nutrients and othersubstances around the globe and connects the surface ocean and atmosphere withthe huge reservoir of the deep sea. As such it is of critical importance to theglobal climate system.33 [part0113.html#chapter6-33]It was the shutting down of this delicately balanced, intricatelyinterconnected, hugely complex, critical cycle, scientists agree, that causedthe dramatic global cooling of the Younger Dryas. That the shutdown was theresult of colossal meltwater floods out of glacial lakes, and directly off theLaurentide ice cap, is also agreed. A major puzzle, however, as S.J. Fiedelpoints out in a keynote paper in the journal Quaternary International, is whythis should have happened 12,800 years ago, rather than say 800 or 1,000 yearsearlier at the height of the warm phase—known as the Bølling–Allerødinterstadial—that immediately preceded the Younger Dryas.34[part0113.html#chapter6-34] Intuitively one feels the meltwater floods shouldhave been at their peak during the warming phase. In reality however it was onlyat the Bølling–Allerød/Younger Dryas Boundary that the meltwater releasesoccurred.The solution to the mystery seems transparently obvious to Richard Firestone,Allen West, Jim Kennett and other proponents of the Younger Dryas impacthypothesis. Quite simply, there is no mystery! In their reckoning, the hugemeltwater floods that so radically affected global climate were caused bymultiple large fragments of a comet ripping through the earth’s atmosphere andsmashing down into the ice cap—not just one fragment of half a kilometer or soas envisaged by C. Warren Hunt, but as many as eight fragments, and possiblymore, including some that might have been as much as two kilometers indiameter.35 [part0113.html#chapter6-35]The colossal heat generated by such impacts, with a combined explosive powerestimated as we have seen at ten million megatons, provides all the energyneeded to set off a truly cataclysmic meltdown of huge sectors of the NorthAmerican ice cap. The gigantic flood that would have followed, after scouringthe land in its path, would indeed have entered the oceans as “a great gush offreshwater” and provided the shock to the Atlantic meridional overturningcirculation that kept global climate savagely cold for the next 1,200 years. Thesituation would have been worsened by the injection of dust and immensequantities of smoke into the upper atmosphere “blocking sunlight for an extendedperiod of time,” which would, of course, have had the effect of loweringtemperatures even further. Moreover:The impact event, followed by extensive fires and sudden climate change, likelycontributed together to the rapid extinction of the megafauna and many otheranimals.36 [part0113.html#chapter6-36]The reader will recall that no less than thirty-five genera of North Americanmammals became extinct during the Younger Dryas.37 [part0113.html#chapter6-37]We are therefore, by definition, looking for “an extinction mechanism that iscapable of wiping out up to thirty-five genera across a continent in a geologicinstant.”38 [part0113.html#chapter6-38] Nor is it just North America that wemust consider—for most of the diverse megafauna of South America that hadflourished before the Younger Dryas also suffered extinction by 12,000 yearsago, i.e, before the Younger Dryas came to an end.39 [part0113.html#chapter6-39]Could it have been “overkill” by human hunters? The question touches upon acontentious issue—namely when, in fact, and from where, did human beings firstarrive in the Americas? Whatever the answer, it seems implausible that bands ofnomadic hunter-gatherers would have been either motivated, or ruthlesslyefficient enough, to wipe out so many animals, including giants like theColumbian mammoth, in so short a time across two continents. Moreover there ismuch to suggest that human beings in the Americas themselves entered a period ofdeep distress during the Younger Dryas that would have further reduced theirmotivation and efficiency. Archaeological evidence from South America islimited, but in North America, this was the time when the Clovis culture, withits sophisticated stone weapons technology, abruptly vanished from the record.Indeed, all available indicators point to “a significant decline and/orreorganization in human population during the early centuries of the YoungerDryas.”40 [part0113.html#chapter6-40]Once again, therefore, the only explanation that makes complete sense of theevidence is the comet-impact hypothesis of Firestone, Kennett, West and theirlarge group of colleagues and co-authors.In the light of their findings, which we have reviewed extensively in thepreceding chapters, I propose the following:1 There was indeed cataclysmic flooding in North America at the end of the IceAge.2 It was not primarily caused by outburst floods from glacial lakes but ratherby the rapid, almost instantaneous, meltdown of a large area of the ice cap.3 The heat source needed to initiate this meltdown came from the kinetic energyof a series of impacts from fragments of a giant comet that entered the earth’satmosphere over North America 12,800 years ago and bombarded the North Americanice cap.4 North America, while being the epicenter of the disaster, was by no means theonly region hit. Other fragments of the disintegrating comet, including someparticularly large objects, appear to have smashed into the European ice cap. Inthis connection it may be of relevance that recent high-resolution sonar scansof the English Channel, the floor of which was above water during the Ice Age,have revealed evidence of cataclysmic flooding there in the form of a400-kilometer-long network of submerged and partially infilled valleys carvedinto the bedrock. “The data show a collection of landforms that, taken together,indicate a catastrophic flood origin,” state the authors of a study published inNature. The study specifically likens these now submerged landforms to “theCheney–Palouse terrain of the Channeled Scabland of Washington, USA.” Theauthors state that they “cannot resolve the absolute timing of the floodingevents.” They do conclude, however, that their study “provides the first directevidence that a megaflood event was responsible for carving the English Channelvalley network. Our observations are consistent with erosion by high-magnitudeflows, as in the Channeled Scabland.”41 [part0113.html#chapter6-41]5 Altogether more than 50 million square kilometers of the earth’s surface wereaffected by impacts and airbursts of fragments of the Younger Dryas comet, somelarge, some smaller, but all devastating in their effects, extending from NorthAmerica, right across the Atlantic Ocean and across Europe, with the final rainof fragments falling as far afield as the Middle East.6 The combined effect of these multiple impacts, particularly the immensefreshwater floods into the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans that followed, set off theYounger Dryas cooling event, itself a cataclysm on a truly global scale thatresulted in the extinction of huge numbers of animal species and pressedhumanity very hard.7 The human costs of the disaster might not have been confined to the completedestruction of hunter-gatherer cultures, such as the “Clovis” people of NorthAmerica. The possibility must be considered that an advanced civilization, nowlost to history, might also have been obliterated.Spring is comingWhat is particularly striking is that the very radical climate changes at boththe onset and the termination of the Younger Dryas were global and wereaccomplished within the span of a human generation.42[part0113.html#chapter6-42] Again the comet-impact hypothesis makes the bestsense of this. The estimated combined explosive force of the impacts at tenmillion megatons would have lofted sufficient ejecta into the atmosphere 12,800years ago to plunge the earth into a long, sustained twilight, akin to a nuclearwinter—the “time of darkness” that so many ancient myths speak of—capable ofreducing solar radiation for more than 1,000 years. The dramatic warming thatbegan 11,600 years ago would then be explained by the final dissipation of theejecta cloud coupled with an end to the system-wide inertia that had besetthermohaline circulation in the North Atlantic.43 [part0113.html#chapter6-43]Another possibility, not necessarily mutually contradictory with any of theabove mechanisms, is that 11,600 years ago the earth interacted again with thedebris stream of the same fragmenting comet that had caused the Younger Dryas tostart 12,800 years ago. On the second occasion, however, analysis suggests thatthe primary impacts were not on land or onto ice but into the world’s oceans,throwing up vast plumes of water vapor and creating a “greenhouse effect” thatcaused global warming rather than global cooling.44 [part0113.html#chapter6-44]According to renowned British astronomer Sir Fred Hoyle:The difference between a warm ocean and a cold one amounts to a 10-year supplyof sunlight. Thus the warm conditions produced by a strong water vaporgreenhouse must be maintained for at least a decade in order to produce therequired transformation of the ocean, and this is just about the time for whichwater, suddenly thrown into the stratosphere, might be expected to persistthere. The needed amount of water is so vast, 100 million million tons, thatonly one kind of causative event seems possible, the infall of a comet-sizedobject into a major ocean.45 [part0113.html#chapter6-45]More research certainly needs to be done to establish the exact mechanisms, inall their complexity, that brought about the sudden end of the Younger Dryas,but the effects on global climate are already well understood. The Greenland icecores, those invaluable windows into the past, tell us that:temperatures rose in less than a decade at the climate transition marking theend of the Younger Dryas cold interval and the beginning of the warmer Holoceneepoch at 11,600 years before the present.46 [part0113.html#chapter6-46] In lessthan 20 years, the climate in the North Atlantic region turned into a milder andless stormy regime, as a consequence of a rapid retreat of sea-ice cover. Awarming of 7 degrees centigrade was completed in about 50 years.47[part0113.html#chapter6-47]In exactly the same interval, in the subalpine belt of Western Europe, treespecies that had never been present before, including Laris, Pinus cembra andBetula, suddenly began to proliferate.48 [part0113.html#chapter6-48]In Northwestern Montana, in the USA, glacial ice in Marias Pass had recededupvalley from the canyon mouth and the Sun River Glacier had completely vanishedby 11,200 years ago.49 [part0113.html#chapter6-49]A thousand other examples could be cited, but the message is the sameeverywhere—from Tasmania to the Andes, from Turkey to Japan, from North Americato Australia, from Peru to Egypt, winter had ended and a great global spring hadbegun. “Such is the rebirth of the Cosmos,” as the Hermetic Texts proclaim. “Itis a making again of all things good, a holy and awe-inspiring restoration ofall nature…”50 [part0113.html#chapter6-50]A rebirth?A making again?A restoration?But of what? Who went before? What exactly was to be reborn?We will consider these questions in the following chapters."},{"pageContent":" Part III [part0131.html#c_part3]Sages [part0131.html#c_part3]"},{"pageContent":" Chapter 7 [part0131.html#c_ch7]The Fire Next Time [part0131.html#c_ch7]Three singularities occurred near the end of the last Ice Age, linked to thesudden onset and equally sudden termination of the mysterious epoch known as theYounger Dryas:• Somewhere around 12,800 years ago, after more than two thousand years ofuninterrupted global warming (and with a margin of error of plus or minus 150years that is as close as the resolution of the data allows us to get to theactual moment), a flood of icy meltwater entered the North Atlantic so suddenlyand in such quantities that it disrupted ocean circulation. The source of theflood was the North American ice cap. Since the previous two millennia hadwitnessed continuous sea-level rise, the resolution of the data means there isno way of knowing exactly how much coastal land was swallowed up by thissingular event. With so much new water that had previously been locked in iceabruptly added, however, we may surmise that a dramatic and instantaneous risein sea level did occur.1 [part0114.html#chapter7-1]• In the same geological instant that the meltwater flood was unleashed, globaltemperatures plummeted and the world’s climate underwent a reversal from thatbalmy two-thousand-year-long “summer” that had begun about 15,000 years ago (by13,000 years ago, conditions are thought to have improved to such an extent thatthey were warmer and wetter than they are today) to a savage and icy globalwinter. Again the resolution of the data does not allow us to say exactly howsoon after the meltwater flood the deep-freeze began but, as we saw in theprevious chapter, there is much to suggest that this radical reversal oftemperatures was achieved within the span of a single human generation. In thatsame span the ice sheets that had everywhere been melting and in retreat beganremorselessly to re-advance and sea-level rise ceased.• Around 11,600 years ago, again with a margin of error of 150 years in eitherdirection imposed by the data—but again apparently within a singlegeneration—the freeze suddenly ended, global temperatures soared, and theremnant ice caps collapsed, shedding their residual water burden into theworld’s oceans which rose dramatically to close to today’s level.Our ancestors passed through these tumultuous changes and it is inconceivablethat they would not have remarked upon them or sought to speak about theirexperiences to one another. Their stories and eyewitness accounts, would, inturn, have become part of revered oral traditions and as such would have beenpassed down from generation to generation until they became hoary with age. Asthe reader will recall from Chapter Three, certain Native American “myths” do,absolutely, seem to speak of events at the end of the last Ice Age. The terriblefloods that scoured and ravaged the land are described in detail. But of evengreater interest are the traditions of the “star with the long wide tail” that“came down here once, thousands of years ago,” that “burned up everything” andthat “made a different world” in which “the weather was colder than before.”These traditions appear to memorialize the devastating effects of the cometimpact that we can now date conclusively, within the understood margins oferror, to around 12,800 years ago. We’ve seen how scientists Richard Firestone,Allen West, Jim Kennett and others believe the comet broke into multiplefragments, perhaps eight of which—some with diameters approaching twokilometers—hit the North American ice cap generating huge amounts of heat andinstantly transforming great masses of ice into the floods of meltwater thatdisrupted oceanic circulation and played a key role in bringing on the deepfreeze of the Younger Dryas. The reader will also recall that other fragments ofthe giant comet are thought to have hit the Northern European ice cap and tohave gone on to rain down on even more distant lands as far away as the MiddleEast. Thus, though the epicenter was in North America, it is not surprising thatthe Younger Dryas was a global event that affected peoples and cultures allaround the world.What is surprising is the remarkable consistency with which traditions fromevery part of the globe speak not only of cataclysmic events but also of veryspecific warnings given to certain selected “wise” or “good” or “pure” humans inadvance of the impending cataclysm. We saw several examples of such warnings inthe Native American traditions reviewed in Chapter Three, but if we traveloceans and continents away from the epicenter of the impacts we find similaraccounts of warnings preserved in the Middle East at the farthest extent towhich the effects of the comet have so far been documented. Note this does notmean that the “strewnfield” of comet debris is confined to the 50 million squarekilometers presently recognized. It simply means that samples of sediment fromother regions have thus far not been assayed for nanodiamonds, magnetic andglassy spherules, melt-glass, platinum and other tell-tale proxies of impact.image [../images/00026.jpeg]Figure 23Up to the limit of research so far done, however, the site farthest from NorthAmerica that has produced firm evidence of the presence and effects of theYounger Dryas comet is an archaeological mound, or tell, called Abu Hureyra inSyria which was excavated in 1974 just before completion of the Taqba Dam on theEuphrates River caused it to disappear forever beneath the advancing waters ofLake Assad. Sediment samples from the archaeological trenching of Abu Hureyrawere removed and preserved before the site was flooded and it was the YoungerDryas Boundary layer of one of these samples (from Trench E, and dated to 12,800years ago) that Firestone, West, Kennett and their team assayed in 2012. As wesaw in Chapter Five, they found nanodiamonds, abundant cosmic impact spherulesand melt-glass that could only have formed at temperatures in excess of 2,200degrees Celsius suggesting that the site was “near the center of a high-energyair-burst/impact.”2 [part0114.html#chapter7-2]Abu Hureyra cannot be subjected to further direct archaeological investigationsince it now lies under Lake Assad, but Firestone, Kennett and West believe theeffects of the comet on “that settlement and its inhabitants would have beensevere.”3 [part0114.html#chapter7-3] Of note is the fact that the site liesclose both to southeastern Turkey, where Göbekli Tepe is situated, and to themodern state of Iran—formerly Persia—where traditions of great antiquity havebeen preserved in the scriptures of Zoroastrianism, the pre-Islamic religion ofancient Persia.“The fatal winters are going to fall…”Exactly how old Zoroastrianism is has not yet been satisfactorily established byscholars, since even the lifetime of its prophet Zarathustra (more usually knownas Zoroaster) is uncertain. Indeed, as Columbia University’s authoritativeEncyclopedia Iranica admits: “Controversy over Zarathustra’s date has been anembarrassment of long standing to Zoroastrian studies.”4[part0114.html#chapter7-4]The Greek historians were among the first to address themselves to the matter.Plutarch, for example, tells us that Zoroaster “lived 5,000 years before theTrojan War”5 [part0114.html#chapter7-5] (itself a matter of uncertainhistoricity but generally put at around 1300 BC, thus 5,000 plus 1,300 = 6300BC). A similar chronology is given by Diogenes Laertius who relates thatZoroaster lived “6,000 years before Xerxes’ Greek campaign”6[part0114.html#chapter7-6] (i.e. around 6480 BC). More recent scholars haveproposed dates as far apart as 1750 BC and “258 years before Alexander”7[part0114.html#chapter7-7] (i.e. around 588 BC). Whatever the truth of thematter, it is agreed that Zoroaster himself borrowed from much earliertraditions and that Zoroastrianism, therefore, like many other religions, hasroots that extend very far back into prehistory.In the Zoroastrian scriptures known as the Zend Avesta certain verses inparticular are recognized as drawing on these very ancient oral traditions.8[part0114.html#chapter7-8] The verses speak of a primordial father figure calledYima, the first man, the first king and the founder of civilization and appearin the opening section of the Zend Avesta known as the Vendidad. There we readhow the god Ahura Mazda created the first land, “Airyana Vaejo, by the goodriver Daitya,”9 [part0114.html#chapter7-9] as a paradise on earth and how “thefair Yima, the great shepherd … was the first mortal” with whom Ahura Mazdachose to converse, instructing him to become a preacher.10[part0114.html#chapter7-10] Yima refused, at which the god set him a differenttask:Since thou wantest not to be the preacher and the bearer of my law, then make myworld thrive, make my world increase; undertake thou to nourish, to rule and towatch over my world.11 [part0114.html#chapter7-11]To this Yima agreed at which the god presented him with a golden ring and aponiard—a long, tapered thrusting knife—inlaid with gold. Significantly, for wewill see in Chapter Seventeen there are close parallels to this story as faraway as the Andes mountains of South America, Yima then:pressed the earth with the golden ring and bored it with the poniard.12[part0114.html#chapter7-12]By this act, we learn he “made the earth grow larger by one third than it wasbefore,” a feat that over the course of thousands of years he repeated twicemore—in the process eventually doubling the land area available for “the flocksand herds with men and dogs and birds,” who gathered unto him “at his will andwish, as many as he wished.”13 [part0114.html#chapter7-13]Anatomically modern humans like ourselves have existed, so far as we know, for alittle less than two hundred thousand years (the earliest anatomically modernhuman skeleton acknowledged by science is from Ethiopia and dates to 196,000years ago).14 [part0114.html#chapter7-14] Within this time-span there has beenonly one period when those parts of the earth that are useful to humansincreased dramatically in size and that was during the last Ice Age between100,000 and 11,600 years ago. Indeed, previously submerged lands totaling 27million square kilometers—equivalent to the area of Europe and China addedtogether—were exposed by lowered sea-levels at the last glacial maximum 21,000years ago. While it is probably far-fetched to suppose that it is this very realincrease of useful land—of which a great part was still above water at thebeginning of the Younger Dryas 12,800 years ago—that is referred to in the Yimastory, or that it has anything to do with the golden age that Yima’s benign rulesupposedly achieved in Airyana Vaejo,15 [part0114.html#chapter7-15] it isinteresting to note what happened next.After another immense span of time, we read, Yima was summoned to “a meetingplace by the good river Daitya” where the god Ahura Mazda appeared to himbearing an ominous warning of sudden and catastrophic climate change:O fair Yima, upon the material world the fatal winters are going to fall, thatshall bring the fierce, foul frost; upon the material world the fatal wintersare going to fall that shall make snowflakes fall thick, even on the highesttops of mountains …Therefore make thee a Vara [a hypogeum, or underground enclosure] long as ariding ground on every side of the square, and thither bring the seeds of sheepand oxen, of men, of dogs, of birds, and of red blazing fires … Thither thoushalt bring the seeds of men and women of the greatest, best and finest kinds onthis earth; thither shalt thou bring the seeds of every kind of cattle, of thegreatest, best and finest kinds on this earth. Thither shalt thou bring theseeds of every kind of tree, of the greatest, best and finest kinds on thisearth; thither shalt thou bring the seeds of every kind of fruit, the fullest offood and sweetest of odor. All those seeds shalt thou bring, two of every kind,to be kept inexhaustible there, so long as those men shall stay in the Vara.There shall be no humpbacked, none bulged forward there; no impotent, nolunatic … no leprous.16 [part0114.html#chapter7-16]So … you get the idea? This underground hideaway was to serve as a refuge from aterrible winter that was about to seize Airyana Vaejo—a winter at the onset ofwhich, as the Bundahish, another Zoroastrian text, informs us:the evil spirit … sprang like a snake out of the sky down to the earth … Herushed in at noon, and thereby the sky was as shattered and frightened by him asa sheep by a wolf. He came onto the water which was arranged below the earth,and then the middle of this earth was pierced and entered by him … He rushed outupon the whole creation and he made the world quite as injured and dark atmidday as though it were dark night.17 [part0114.html#chapter7-17]Studying these accounts I couldn’t help but be reminded of the two millennia ofwarm, fine weather, which must indeed have seemed like a golden age, before thesudden lethal onset of the Younger Dryas 12,800 years ago. The Zoroastrian textswould not be far wrong in describing it as a “fierce, foul frost” and as “afatal winter.” The “evil spirit” to whom this affliction is attributed is AngraMainyu, the agent of darkness, destruction, wickedness and chaos, who stands inopposition to and seeks to undermine and undo all the good works of AhuraMazda—for Zoroastrianism is a profoundly dualistic religion in which humanbeings, and the choices we make for good or evil, are seen as the objects of aneternal competition, or contest, between the opposed forces of darkness andlight.And in this contest the darkness sometimes wins. Thus the Vendidad reminds usthat although Airyana Vaejo was “the first of the good lands and countries”created by Ahura Mazda, it could not resist the evil one:Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter-created by hiswitchcraft the serpent in the river, and winter, a work of the demons … [Now]there are ten winter months there, two summer months, and these are cold for thewaters, cold for the earth, cold for the trees. Winter falls there, with theworst of its plagues.18 [part0114.html#chapter7-18]In other translations the phrase “the serpent in the river, and winter” is givenas “a great serpent and Winter” and, alternatively, as “a mighty serpent andsnow.”19 [part0114.html#chapter7-19]Again … you get the idea. The metaphor that is being repeatedly driven home hereis that of the mighty serpent who springs from the sky down to the earth, whopenetrates the earth, and who brings a prolonged winter upon the world so severethat it is “dark” (“most turbid, opaque” according to some translations20[part0114.html#chapter7-20]) at midday, and even the fleeting summer months aretoo cold for human life. Once again, the whole scenario seems very accurately todescribe the terrible conditions that would have afflicted the world after theYounger Dryas comet spread its trail of destruction across at least 50 millionsquare kilometers, brought on “a vehement destroying frost” and threw suchquantities of dust into the upper atmosphere, together with smoke from thecontinent-wide wildfires sparked off by airbursts and superheated ejecta, that aturbid, opaque darkness would indeed have filled the skies, reflecting back thesun’s rays and perpetuating something very like a nuclear winter for centuries.The Zoroastrian texts leave us in no doubt that these conditions posed a deadlythreat to the future survival of civilization. It was for this reason that AhuraMazda came to Yima with his warning and his instruction to build an undergroundshelter where some remnant of humanity could take refuge, keeping safe the seedsof all animals and plants, until the dire winter had passed and spring returnedto the world. Moreover the account reveals very little that seems “mythical,” orthat obviously derives from flights of religious fancy. Rather the whole thinghas about it an atmosphere of hard-headed practical planning that adds achilling note of veracity.For example the admonition that deformed, impotent, lunatic and leprous peopleshould be kept out of the Vara sounds a lot like eugenics, a distasteful policyto be sure, but one that might be implemented if the survival of the human racewas at stake and there was limited space available in the refuge. For the samereasons it is not surprising that only the seeds of “the greatest, best andfinest” kinds of trees, fruits and vegetables, those that are “fullest of foodand sweetest of odor” are to be brought to the Vara. Why waste space on anythingbut the best?Also although it is certain that a number of carefully selected people were tobe admitted to the Vara, perhaps as caretakers and managers of the project, andas future breeding stock, the emphasis throughout is on seeds—which in the caseof human beings would be sperm from the males and eggs from the females. So whenwe read that the Vara is to be constructed in three subterranean levels, eachsmaller than the one above, each with its own system of criss-crossing“streets,” it is legitimate to wonder whether some kind of storage system,perhaps with ranks of shelves arranged in criss-crossing aisles, might notreally be what is meant here:In the largest part of the place thou shalt make nine streets, six in the middlepart, three in the smallest. To the streets of the largest part thou shalt bringa thousand seeds of men and women; to the streets of the middle part, sixhundred; to the streets of the smallest part, three hundred.21[part0114.html#chapter7-21]If it seems fanciful to imagine that we might, in an almost high-tech sense, belooking at the specifications of a seed bank here, then how are we to assessother “technological” aspects of the Vara—for example its lighting system? Aswell as making a door to the place, and sealing it up with the golden ringalready given to him by Ahura Mazda, Yima is also to fashion “a window,self-shining within.”22 [part0114.html#chapter7-22] When Yima asks forclarification as to the nature of this “self-shining” window Ahura Mazda tellshim cryptically, “There are uncreated lights and created lights.” The former arethe stars, the moon and the sun, which will not be seen from within the confinesof the Vara during the long winter, but the latter are “artificial lights” which“shine from below.”23 [part0114.html#chapter7-23]Yima did as he was instructed and completed the Vara which, thereafter, “glowedwith its own light.”24 [part0114.html#chapter7-24] That accomplished, he then:made waters flow in a bed a mile long; there he settled birds, by the evergreenbanks that bear never-failing food. There he established dwelling places,consisting of a house with a balcony, a courtyard and a gallery …25[part0114.html#chapter7-25]There, too, we are reminded, in accord with the commands of the god,he brought the seeds of men and women … There he brought the seeds of every kindof tree [and] … every kind of fruit … All those seeds he brought, two of everykind, to be kept inexhaustible there, so long as those men shall stay in theVara …26 [part0114.html#chapter7-26]Finally, we learn that:every fortieth year, to every couple two are born, a male and a female. And thusit is for every sort of cattle. And the men in the Vara, which Yima made, livethe happiest life.27 [part0114.html#chapter7-27]Interestingly the translator explains, in a footnote drawn from various ancientlearned commentaries on the text, that the human inhabitants of the Vara “livethere for 150 years; some say they never die.”28 [part0114.html#chapter7-28]Moreover, and particularly intriguing, the births of offspring to every coupledo not result from sexual union but “from the seeds deposited in the Vara.”29[part0114.html#chapter7-29]Other hints of a mysterious lost technology connected to Yima include amiraculous cup in which he could see everything that was happening anywhere inthe world and a jeweled glass throne (sometimes described as “a glass chariot”)that was capable of flight.30 [part0114.html#chapter7-30]Flood and rainAs well as a climate catastrophe in the form of an overnight reversion to peakIce Age cold, we also know that the Younger Dryas involved extensive globalflooding as a large fraction of the North American ice cap melted and pouredinto the world ocean. It is therefore noteworthy that the Zoroastrian textsspeak not only of the “vehement, destroying frost” of a global winter but alsoof an associated flood accompanied by heavy precipitation, in which:Every single drop of rain became as big as a bowl and the water stood the heightof a man over the whole of this earth.31 [part0114.html#chapter7-31]On the other side of the world and much closer to the North American epicenterof the cataclysm, the Popol Vuh, an original document of the ancient Quiche Mayaof Guatemala, based on pre-conquest sources, also speaks of a flood andassociates it with “much hail, black rain and mist, and indescribable cold.”32[part0114.html#chapter7-32] It says, in a remarkable echo of the Zoroastriantradition, that this was a period when “it was cloudy and twilight all over theworld … The faces of the sun and the moon were covered.”33[part0114.html#chapter7-33] Other Maya sources confirm that these strange andterrible phenomena were experienced by mankind “in the time of the ancients. Theearth darkened … It happened that the sun was still bright and clear. Then, atmidday, it got dark…”34 [part0114.html#chapter7-34] Sunlight was not seen again“until the twenty-sixth year after the flood.”35 [part0114.html#chapter7-35]Returning to the Middle East, the famous account of the Hebrew patriarch Noahand the great Ark in which he rides out the flood commands attention. It isobvious that there are many parallels with the story of Yima and his Vara. TheVara, after all, is a means of surviving a terrible and devastating winter whichwill destroy every living creature by enchaining the earth in a freezing trap ofice and snow. The Ark, likewise, is a means of surviving a terrible anddevastating flood which will destroy every living creature by drowning the worldin water. In both cases a deity—Ahura Mazda in the case of the Zoroastriantradition, the God Yahweh in the case of the Hebrew tradition—intervenes to giveadvance warning to a good and pure man to prepare for the coming cataclysm. Ineach case the essence of the project is to preserve the seeds, or the breedingpairs, of all life:And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring intothe Ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creepingthing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, tokeep them alive.36 [part0114.html#chapter7-36]Easily missed, but noteworthy, is the fact that Noah’s Ark, like Yima’s Vara, isto have a “window,” is to be closed with a “door” and is to consist of threelevels:A window shalt thou make to the Ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above;and the door of the Ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second,and third stories shalt thou make it.37 [part0114.html#chapter7-37]Last but not least, there are hints of a lost lighting technology in Noah’s Arkthat parallel the references to the “artificial lights” in the Vara. In TheLegends of the Jews, Louis Ginzberg’s remarkable and comprehensive compilationof ancient stories and traditions connected to the Hebrew Bible, we read thatthe whole journey of the Ark, “during the year of the flood,” was conducted indarkness both by day and by night:All the time it lasted, the sun and the moon shed no light …38[part0114.html#chapter7-38]However just like the “self-shining window” of the Vara:The Ark was illuminated by a precious stone, the light of which was morebrilliant by night than by day, so enabling Noah to distinguish between day andnight.39 [part0114.html#chapter7-39]Underground citiesNoah’s Ark, as is well known, is said to have ended its journey on the slopes ofMount Ararat, the symbolic heartland of ancient Armenia but now, as a result ofwars in the early twentieth century, located within the modern state of Turkey.Turkey, in turn, shares a border with Iran—ancient Persia—from which theaccounts of Yima’s Vara come down to us.image [../images/00027.jpeg]Figure 24It is therefore intriguing that Turkey’s Cappadocia region has a very largenumber of ancient underground structures hewn out of solid rock and usually,like the Vara, consisting of multiple levels stacked one above the other. Theseunderground “cities,” as they are known, include the eerie and spectacular siteof Derinkuyu, which I was able to visit in 2013. Lying beneath a modern town ofthe same name, eight of its levels are presently open to the public, althoughfurther levels remain closed off below and, astonishingly, a subterranean tunnelseveral kilometers in length connects it to another similar hypogeum atKaymakli.Entering Derinkuyu was like crossing some invisible barrier into an unexpectednetherworld. One minute I was standing in bright sunshine; the next, after I hadducked into the cool, dank, dimly-lit system of tunnels and galleries (noself-shining windows now; only low wattage electric light), I felt I had beentransported to a realm carved out by mythical dwarves at the dawn of time. Inplaces the tunnels are low and narrow so that one must stoop and walk in singlefile between walls stained and blackened with ancient smoke and overgrown hereand there with green mold. At regular intervals, slid back into deep recesses, Ipassed hulking megalithic doors, shaped like millstones, 5 to 6 feet (1.5 to 1.8meters) in diameter and weighing close to half a ton. These were clearlydesigned to be rolled out to block access. Stairways and steep ramps led downfrom level to level and, although all the levels were interconnected, therolling stone doors could be used to isolate them from one another when needed.I noticed a remarkable system of plunging, sheer-sided ventilation shaftsconnecting the deepest levels with the surface—and doing so to such good effectthat the gusts of fresh air were still palpable 80 meters (260 feet) or morebeneath the ground. In some places the passageway I was following would debouchinto a junction where tunnels branched off in several directions and morestairways led down to even lower levels. And here and there, now to one side ofthe passageway, now to the other, sometimes accessed by means of holes cut inthe wall, sometimes through full-sized doorways, lay small low-ceilinged grottosin which even a few people sitting together would have felt cramped. Butsometimes those doors would lead into interconnected networks of chambers andpassages and sometimes they would open out suddenly into lofty halls andspacious rooms with barrel-vault ceilings looming high overhead, supported onmonolithic columns hewn from the living rock.The whole place, in short, is a complex and cunning labyrinth on an immensescale—a work of astonishing architectural complexity that would be impressive ifit had been built above ground, but that is utterly breathtaking when oneconsiders that it all had to be mined, chiseled, hammered, cut and gouged out ofthe volcanic bedrock. Later, studying a plan, I realized that this vasthypogeum, looking in cross-section like a gigantic rabbit warren and extendingover an area of more than 4 square kilometers,40 [part0114.html#chapter7-40] layunderfoot wherever one went in the modern town of Derinkuyu, streets beneathstreets, rooms beneath rooms, a secret antipodal city of unknown antiquity andof unknown purpose but certainly the product of immense ingenuity, determinationand skill.And Derinkuyu is just one of two hundred such subterranean complexes, eachcontaining a minimum of two levels (with around forty containing three levels ormore) that have been identified in Turkey in the area between Kayseri andNevsehir.41 [part0114.html#chapter7-41] Moreover, new discoveries are constantlybeing made. Derinkuyu itself was found in 1963 after builders renovating thecellar of a modern home broke through to an ancient passageway below. And mostrecently, in 2014, workers preparing the ground for a new housing project atNevsehir, an hour’s drive north of Derinkuyu, stumbled upon yet anotherunsuspected hypogeum. Archaeologists were called in and it was quickly realizedthat this one was bigger than any others so far known. As Hasan Unver, Mayor ofNevsehir put it, Derinkuyu and Kaymakli are little more than “kitchens” whencompared to the newly-explored site. “It is not a known underground city,” addedMehmet Ergun Turan, head of Turkey’s Housing Development Administration. “Tunnelpassages of seven kilometers are being discussed. Naturally, when the discoverywas made, we stopped the construction we were planning to do in the area.”42[part0114.html#chapter7-42]Several commentators immediately speculated that the newly discovered site mightbe “5,000 years old,”43 [part0114.html#chapter7-43] but there is no basis forthis—or really for any date. All we can say for sure is that the earliestsurviving historical mention of Turkey’s underground cities is found in theAnabapsis of the Greek historian Xenophon written in the fourth century BC44[part0114.html#chapter7-44]—so they are older than that.But the question is, how much older?As the reader will recall from Chapter One, there is no objective way to datestructures made entirely of rock. What archaeologists look for, therefore, areorganic materials that can be carbon dated. To be useful, however, these organicmaterials must be excavated from locations—under a megalith that has never beenmoved, for example, or in the original mortar in a joint between two stoneblocks—that allow reasonable deductions to be made about the date the associatedstructural elements were put in place.This is why the mysterious decision by the builders of Göbekli Tepe to bury themegalithic enclosures there has been so helpful to archaeology. Once buried theystayed buried and organic materials in the fill can thus be used to makevaluable inferences about their age. In many other sites, by contrast, there isthe possibility that the intrusion of later organic materials will give afalsely young date, and in some—the underground cities of Turkey being a primeexample—no reliable dating can be done. This is because the sites were used,reused and indeed repurposed many times down the ages by many different peoples,with organic materials being introduced on every occasion, thus making itimpossible to draw any inferences about the epoch of their originalconstruction.The general view of archaeologists is that the underground structures wereoriginally developed in the seventh or eighth centuries BC by an Indo-Europeanpeople called the Phrygians who lived in Cappadocia at the time. The theory isthat the Phrygians began the project by widening and deepening natural caves andtunnels that already existed in the volcanic rock, making use of the spaces theycreated for storage and possibly as places of refuge from attackers.By Roman times, with the Phrygians long gone, the inhabitants of the area wereGreek-speaking Christians who further developed and expanded the undergroundcaverns, rededicating some of the rooms as chapels and leaving inscriptions inGreek, some of which survive to this day. In the Byzantine era, from the eighthto the twelfth centuries AD, the Eastern Roman Empire was locked in wars withnewly Islamicized Arabs and the underground cities became places of refugeagain—a function they continued to serve during the Mongol invasions of thefourteenth century AD. Later still, Greek Christians used the cities to escapepersecution at the hands of Turkish Muslim rulers, and this practice continuedinto the twentieth century when the structures finally fell into disuse afterthe truce and population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923.45[part0114.html#chapter7-45]With such a checkered history it is easy to see why the underground citiescannot be dated using objective archaeological techniques. Moreover the vasteffort that went into their excavation out of solid rock, and theirsophisticated ventilation systems, speak of powerful long-term motives farbeyond the limited and temporary need for shelter from attackers. With this inmind let us consider a scenario in which the Phrygians, favored for no goodreason by archaeologists as the first makers of the cities, were themselves justone of the many later cultures to make use of them. It is perfectly possiblethat this is the case and, if so, then it is also possible that theseextraordinary underground structures might date back to a time long before thePhrygians—perhaps even as far back as the “fatal winters” of the Younger Dryasthat set in around 12,800 years ago.There is no proof of this, of course. Nonetheless Turkish historian andarchaeologist Omer Demir, author of Cappadocia: Cradle of History, is of theopinion that Derinkuyu does in fact date back to the Palaeolithic.46[part0114.html#chapter7-46] His argument is based partly on the notion that italready existed in Phrygian times,47 [part0114.html#chapter7-47] partly onstylistic differences between the upper (older) levels and the lower (younger)levels48 [part0114.html#chapter7-48] and partly on the fact that marks of theimplements used to cut the rock have worn completely away in the upper levelsbut are still visible in the lower levels:It is necessary for a long period of time to pass for the chisel marks todisappear. This means that there was quite a time difference between the yearsof construction of the first stories and the last stories.49[part0114.html#chapter7-49]Demir also suggests that the huge quantities of rock excavated to make theunderground city—which are nowhere in evidence in the vicinity today—were dumpedinto local streams and carried off.50 [part0114.html#chapter7-50] In one ofthese streams, the Sognali, at a distance of 26 kilometers (16 miles) fromDerinkuyu, hand-axes, rock-chips and other Palaeolithic artifacts were found.51[part0114.html#chapter7-51]The evidence is suggestive at best. I would not want to bet my life or myreputation on it! Nonetheless the scenario that sees Derinkuyu and the otherunderground cities constructed in the Upper Palaeolithic around 12,800 years agoat the onset of the Younger Dryas has the great merit of no longer leaving uscasting about for a motive commensurate with the huge effort involved. We areinformed of that motive quite explicitly in the story of Yima. Stated simply,the cities are Varas, cut down into the depths of the earth as places of refugefrom the horrors of the Younger Dryas, which were not limited to the “vehementdestroying frost” but—as we know from the cosmic impact spherules and melt-glassfound in sediment samples at nearby Abu Hureyra—also included the terrifyingthreat of bombardment from the skies.Like a snake out of the skyIt is close to certain, if our planet did indeed cross the path of a giant comet12,800 years ago as Firestone, Kennett and West maintain, that the bombardmentwould not have been limited to the large fragments that came down during thefirst event. The comet’s debris stream would have remained on an earth-crossingorbit and would very likely have resulted in decades, perhaps even centuries, ofsubsequent bombardments—not on the same scale of intensity as the initialencounter, but nonetheless able to cause catastrophic damage and to spreadenough fear and dismay of the mighty “serpent” lingering in the heavens tojustify the construction of secure underground shelters.Indeed, as we will see, the earth may still cross the debris stream of the giantYounger Dryas comet today and large, deadly objects, blacker than coal,invisible to our telescopes, may still be orbiting in that stream today. I’mreminded again of the Ojibwa prophecy reviewed in Chapter Three:The star with the long, wide tail is going to destroy the world some day when itcomes low again. That’s the comet called Long-Tailed Heavenly Climbing Star.Is the Younger Dryas comet coming back? Could it be that it did not spend allits anger and destructive force with the fragments that hit the earth and causedthe vehement destroying winter of the Younger Dryas 12,800 years ago?Curiously the ancient Iranian traditions contain a prophecy also, for it is saidthat Yima will return, and will walk again among men, when:the signs foreshadowing the last of days appear. Of these the worst will be awinter more terrible than any the world has seen before when it will rain andsnow and hail for three long years.52 [part0114.html#chapter7-52]The fiery descent of more fragments of the comet could bring about such awinter, just as happened 12,800 years ago. And just as happened then, it woulddo so in part because the skies would be darkened by debris and smoke from thewildfires caused by airbursts and by the superheated ejecta from the impacts onland. These are grave matters, and we will return to them in Chapter Nineteen.But first we must consider the story of Noah, the Hebrew counterpart of Yima,carried by the waters of the flood—so we are told—to the slopes of Mount Ararat,just a few days’ walk from Göbekli Tepe. The Noah story also contains a prophecywhich is made manifest in the New Testament, 2 Peter 3: 3–7:By water the world of that time was deluged and destroyed. By the same word thepresent heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day ofjudgment and destruction of ungodly men.Or as the old song has it:God gave Noah the rainbow sign: no more water, the fire next time."},{"pageContent":" Chapter 8 [part0131.html#c_ch8]The Antediluvians [part0131.html#c_ch8]The Biblical story of the Deluge is too familiar to require extensive repetitionhere. The essential elements can be summarized as follows:• A life-destroying global flood, sent by God to punish human wickedness.1[part0115.html#chapter8-1]• A man (Noah) selected by God and given advance warning of the coming cataclysmso that he can build a survival ship (the Ark).2 [part0115.html#chapter8-2]• The preservation in the Ark of the seeds, or breeding pairs, of all forms oflife, with a particular emphasis on human life (Noah and his wife together withtheir sons and their wives) and animal life (“of fowls after their kind,” as wesaw in the last chapter, “and of cattle after their kind, of every creepingthing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, tokeep them alive”).3 [part0115.html#chapter8-3]• The Ark rides out the flood until the waters subside.4[part0115.html#chapter8-4]• The Ark comes to rest “on the mountains of Ararat.”5[part0115.html#chapter8-5]• When the waters have “dried up from the earth” God instructs Noah to leave theArk with his family and to “bring out every kind of living creature that is withyou—the birds, the animals, and all the creatures that move along the ground—sothey can multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number on it.”6[part0115.html#chapter8-6]• Noah builds an altar on which he sacrifices some of the animals and birds thathe has just saved from the flood. The smell of the burned offerings is pleasingto God.7 [part0115.html#chapter8-7]• The surviving humans and animals go forth and multiply “and fill the earth” asthey have been commanded.8 [part0115.html#chapter8-8]Mount Ararat rises to 5,137 meters (16,853 feet) and geologists assure us, onthe basis of excellent science, that no part of it has ever been covered byoceanic floodwaters since it began to take shape as a mountain near the end ofthe early Miocene some sixteen million years ago. The presence of anatomicallymodern humans in the world, as we saw in the last chapter, cannot be traced backfurther than two hundred thousand years, and even the last common ancestor withthe chimpanzee—a creature that was very far from being in any sense“human”—takes us back barely six million years, so the notion of a boat withhumans on board being washed up on Mount Ararat is a chronologicalimpossibility.image [../images/00028.jpeg]Figure 25Nonetheless, it is intriguing that the story of the Deluge as given in the OldTestament makes specific and deliberate mention of “the mountains of Ararat”(the “Mount” does in fact have twin peaks) which, in Biblical times, wereunderstood as being part of the “Kingdom of Ararat,”9 [part0115.html#chapter8-9]the historic land of Urartu, conquered by the Assyrian King Shalmaneser in thelate second millenium BC.10 [part0115.html#chapter8-10] Due to the limitedarchaeology that has been undertaken in the region, historians confess that “theorigins of Urartu must remain obscure,”11 [part0115.html#chapter8-11] but theearliest known settlements and the beginnings of agriculture in the region havebeen traced back to “approximately 10,000 to 9000 BC”12[part0115.html#chapter8-12]—in other words to the period of Göbekli Tepe.Moreover, this whole area, Mount Ararat and Göbekli Tepe very much included,formed the heartland of historic Armenia, the direct descendant of the BiblicalKingdom of Ararat whose inhabitants saw—and still today see—themselves as “thePeoples of Ararat.”13 [part0115.html#chapter8-13] Written in the fifth centuryAD, Moses Khorenatsi’s influential History of the Armenians attributed thefounding of the nation to the patriarch Haik, who, it was said, was thegreat-great-great-grandson of Noah himself and thus in the close lineage of theflood survivors who emerged from the Ark.14 [part0115.html#chapter8-14] Indeedit is because of Haik that even in the twenty-first century Armenians stillrefer to themselves as Hai, and to their land as Haiastan.15[part0115.html#chapter8-15] They see it simply as a tragedy of history that somuch of this land, again including Göbekli Tepe and Mount Ararat, is now in thepossession of the Republic of Turkey, following the Armenian genocide of 1915–23in which more than one million ethnic Armenians are believed to have been killedby Turkish forces.16 [part0115.html#chapter8-16]Nationalistic feelings still run high in the communities of the Armeniandiaspora scattered around the world and in the tiny rump of historic Armeniathat forms the Armenian Republic today. These tensions have not left GöbekliTepe untouched, and many Armenians are outraged that Turkey claims this uniquelyimportant site as its own heritage as though the ancient Armenian connection didnot even exist. A few minutes’ search on the internet using the keyword“Portasar,” the former Armenian name of Göbekli Tepe, will confirm this. I’llgive a single example here, a YouTube video entitled “Turkey Presents ArmenianPortasar as Turkish Göbekli Tepe.”17 [part0115.html#chapter8-17] Among thecomments, fairly typical of the remarks made by many viewers, we read:This is the way I look at Portasar (Göbekli Tepe). These people deliberatelyburied a sacred temple. They did this in the anticipation of having itdiscovered many years in the future. They believed in reincarnation. Thosepeople who built Portasar (Göbekli Tepe) are here among the Armenians. Theirspirits have transcended into the Armenian people of today. When you pass onsomething in your family you want to make sure that it goes to only that familymember and no one else. Portasar and those lands will be returned back to theArmenians in accordance with the laws of nature …18 [part0115.html#chapter8-18]In the same vein, though now entirely within the borders of Turkey, Mount Araratremains a potent symbol of Armenian nationalism. A landscape of Mount Ararat,with the floodwaters receding and Noah’s Ark at the summit, dominates the coatof arms of the Republic of Armenia while the mountain itself—so near and yet sofar—looms over the Armenian capital city Yerevan, a haunting and ever presentreminder that:The past is never dead. It’s not even past.19 [part0115.html#chapter8-19]Thus there are many ways in which the story of Noah and his Ark, and of a worldmade anew after a terrible global cataclysm, is still a living force in theregion of Göbekli Tepe, that mysterious sanctuary in the Taurus mountains wherethe great stone circles began to be put in place in 9600 BC—a date that marksthe exact end of the long “fatal winter” of the Younger Dryas. As Klaus Schmidtasked me rhetorically when I interviewed him at the site (see Chapter One):How likely is it to be an accident that the monumental phase at Göbekli Tepestarts in 9600 BC, when the climate of the whole world has taken a sudden turnfor the better and there’s an explosion in nature and in possibilities?There’s something else about that date too. Just as the beginning of the YoungerDryas in 10,800 BC was accompanied by huge global floods and an episode ofrapidly rising sea levels, as icy meltwater from the North American ice cappoured suddenly into the Atlantic Ocean,20 [part0115.html#chapter8-20] so too asecond global flood occurred around 9600 BC as the remnant ice caps in NorthAmerica and northern Europe collapsed simultaneously amidst worldwide globalwarming. The late Cesare Emiliani, Professor in the Department of GeologicalSciences at the University of Miami, carried out isotopic analysis of deep-seasediments21 [part0115.html#chapter8-21] that produced striking evidence ofcataclysmic global flooding “between 12,000 and 11,000 years ago.”22[part0115.html#chapter8-22]So although the floods at the end of the Ice Age could never have carried Noahand his Ark thousands of feet above present sea level to the slopes of MountArarat, they were indeed global in their extent and would have had devastatingconsequences for humans living at that time. Mountainous regions such as theArarat range would have been natural places of refuge—natural places to bring“the seeds of all life” and to start again. Therefore, while the Noah storycannot be literally true in every detail, we must consider the possibility thatit is true in its essence, i.e. that it does record the construction of an“Ark,” in which seeds of useful plants and breeding pairs of animals wereperhaps preserved by people who already knew agriculture and who possessedarchitectural skills, who survived the Flood, who migrated to the lands betweenMount Ararat and Göbekli Tepe, and who subsequently disseminated agriculturaland architectural knowledge to the indigenous hunter-gatherers of that region.The sudden, and indeed completely unprecedented, appearance of giant stonecircles at Göbekli Tepe, which surely could only have been conceived andimplemented by people with extensive prior experience of megalithicarchitecture, and the simultaneous “invention” of agriculture in the exact samelocale, are, in my view, highly suggestive of this possibility. Then, too, thereis the haunting sense that Göbekli Tepe itself constitutes a kind of “Ark”frozen and memorialized in stone, for its iconography is not only all aboutanimals but also—in a number of intriguing reliefs that show women with exposedgenitalia23 [part0115.html#chapter8-23] and males with erect penises24[part0115.html#chapter8-24]—about human fertility. Imagery of the latter sort,including a figure that Karl Luckert, Professor of the History of Religions atMissouri State University, interprets as a classic “Earth Mother,”25[part0115.html#chapter8-25] call to mind God’s command to Moses and his familyto “be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth.”26[part0115.html#chapter8-26]Meanwhile, where else but in Noah’s Ark can we find a menagerie as eclectic asthe one portrayed on the megaliths of Göbekli Tepe—a menagerie, as we saw inChapter One, that includes spiders, scorpions and snakes (“every creeping thingof the earth”), birds and cattle (“fowls after their kind, and cattle aftertheir kind”), and foxes, felines, goats, sheep, gazelles, boars, bears, etc, etc(in short—as Genesis 6: 20 has it, “every kind of animal and every kind ofcreature”)?A final touch. Noah sacrificed some of the animals and birds that he had justsaved from the Flood as an offering to God. At Göbekli Tepe archaeologists havefound the butchered bones of many of the animal species depicted on themegalithic pillars.27 [part0115.html#chapter8-27]Cities from before the FloodIt has long been recognized by scholars that the Biblical Flood narrative is notoriginal to the Old Testament but was borrowed from a much earlier source,indeed a source dating back to the oldest true civilization so far acknowledgedby archaeology—ancient Sumer in Mesopotamia, which arose in the fifth milleniumBC, flourished during the fourth and third millennia BC, and survived into thesecond millenium BC.28 [part0115.html#chapter8-28] The two earliest survivingwritten versions of this global flood “myth” can be seen today at the Universityof Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology,29[part0115.html#chapter8-29] and in the private Schøyen Collection in Norway.30[part0115.html#chapter8-30] Both are written in cuneiform characters in theSumerian language and both have come down to us as fragments rather thancomplete texts.Of the two, however, it is the University of Pennsylvania tablet, found duringexcavations of the Sumerian city of Nippur31 [part0115.html#chapter8-31](located on the Euphrates 200 kilometers south of the modern city of Baghdad)that is the most complete, consisting of the lower third of what was once asix-column tablet of baked clay32 [part0115.html#chapter8-32] and dated to theseventeenth century BC.33 [part0115.html#chapter8-33] The Schøyen tablet, thoughless of it survives, is a little older (dated to the nineteenth to eighteenthcenturies BC34 [part0115.html#chapter8-34]), repeats some of the lines of thePennsylvania fragment and adds a few new details not found elsewhere.35[part0115.html#chapter8-35]image [../images/00029.jpeg]Figure 26: Map of Ancient Sumer showing the antediluvian citiesWhat rare and precious things these little broken slabs of baked mud are! Andwhat a tale they have to tell. When I first read that tale I was instantlyintrigued, because it contains explicit references to the existence of fiveantediluvian cities which, we are informed, were swallowed up by the waters ofthe Flood.The first thirty-seven lines of the University of Pennsylvania tablet aremissing so we do not know how the story begins, but at the point where we enterit the Flood is still far in the future.36 [part0115.html#chapter8-36] We hearabout the creation of human beings, animals and plants.37[part0115.html#chapter8-37] Then another break of thirty-seven lines occursafter which we find that we have jumped forward in time to an epoch of highcivilization. We learn that in this epoch, before the Flood, “kingship waslowered from heaven.”38 [part0115.html#chapter8-38]Then comes the reference to the foundation of Sumer’s antediluvian cities by anunnamed ruler or a god:After the lofty crown and the throne of kingship had been lowered from heaven,He perfected the rites and the exalted divine laws …Founded the five cities … in pure places,Called their names, apportioned them as cult centers.The first of these cities, Eridu …The second Badtibira …The third Larak …The fourth Sippar …The fifth Shuruppak …39 [part0115.html#chapter8-39]“The preserver of the seed of mankind…”When we rejoin the narrative after a third thirty-seven-line lacuna, the scenehas changed bewilderingly. Although the Flood is still in the future, thefoundation of the five antediluvian cities is now far in the past. It isapparent from the context that in the intervening period the cities’ inhabitantshave behaved in such a way as to incur divine displeasure and that a convocationof the gods has been called to punish mankind with the terrible instrument of anearth-destroying flood. At the moment where we pick up the story again, a few ofthe gods are dissenting from this decision and expressing their unhappiness anddissatisfaction with it.40 [part0115.html#chapter8-40]Without preamble, a man called Zisudra is then introduced—the Sumerian archetypeof the Biblical patriarch Noah. The text describes him as “a pious, god-fearingking”41 [part0115.html#chapter8-41] and allows us to understand that one of thegods has taken pity on him. The name of this god has not survived in theUniversity of Pennsylvania tablet, but the Schøyen fragment gives us a clue whenit reveals that Zisudra was not only a king but also a priest of the god Enki.42[part0115.html#chapter8-42] This god, of whom we will hear more later, tellsZisudra:Take my word, give ear to my instructions:A flood will sweep over the cult centers.To destroy the seed of mankind,Is the decision, the word of the assembly of gods.43 [part0115.html#chapter8-43]A text break of forty lines follows which scholars deduce, from the many laterrecensions of the same myth, “must have continued with detailed instructions toZisudra to build a giant boat and thus save himself from destruction.”44[part0115.html#chapter8-44]When the story resumes, the cataclysm has already begun:All the windstorms, exceedingly powerful, attacked as one,At the same time the flood swept over the cult centers.For seven days and seven nights the flood swept over the land,And the huge boat was tossed about by the windstorms on the great waters.45[part0115.html#chapter8-45]Throughout the cataclysm the skies remain dark. Then, on the eighth day, the sunbreaks through the clouds, and the rains and raging storms cease. Opening the“window” of his survival ship, Zisudra looks out over a world that has changedforever and sacrifices an ox and a sheep to the gods.46[part0115.html#chapter8-46]An infuriating lacuna of thirty-nine lines follows, presumably telling us aboutthe place where Zisudra makes landfall and the steps that he takes thereafter.When we pick up the story again, near the end of the text, we find him in thepresence of the high gods of the Sumerian pantheon, Anu and Enlil, who haverepented of their earlier decision to wipe mankind entirely from the face of theearth and are now so grateful to Zisudra for building his ark and surviving theFlood that they decide to make him immortal:Life like a god they gave him;Breath eternal like a god they brought down for him,… Zisudra the king,The preserver of the name of vegetation and of the seed of mankind.47[part0115.html#chapter8-47]The final thirty-nine lines are missing.48 [part0115.html#chapter8-48]The Seven SagesThe late Professor Samuel Noah Kramer, one of the great authorities on ancientSumer, observed that there are “tantalizing obscurities and uncertainties” inthis oldest surviving written version of the worldwide tradition of the Flood.49[part0115.html#chapter8-49] What there can be no doubt about at all, however, isthat the tablet speaks of an urban civilization that existed before the Floodand provides us with the names of its sacred cities: Eridu, Badtibira, Larak,Sippar, Shuruppak. These cities, we are told quite specifically, were swallowedup in the deluge. Moreover, long after Sumer itself had ceased to exist, richtraditions concerning the five cities, the antediluvian epoch, and the Floodsurvived in Mesopotamia, and were repeated by the cultures of Akkad, Assyria andBabylon that later rose to prominence, almost down to Christian times.50[part0115.html#chapter8-50] Indeed it is fair to say that the traditionalhistory of this region, as it was told in antiquity, is very clearly dividedinto two different periods—before and after the Flood—and that both periods wereregarded by the peoples of the region as absolutely factual and real.image [../images/00030.jpeg]Figure 27: The ancient empires of Mesopotamia rose to prominence at differentperiods of history but all maintained traditions of a global Flood that had allbut destroyed mankind in remote antiquity.We saw in Chapter One how the Mesopotamian traditions not only preservedmemories of antediluvian cities, but also of an antediluvian civilizing herocalled Oannes, and the brotherhood of Seven Sages, the “Seven Apkallu” who aresaid to have supported his civilizing mission. As the reader will recall, thesesages are often depicted in the surviving art of the region as bearded menholding a peculiar kind of bag or bucket, but sometimes they are also shown astherianthropes, part bird and part human in form. As I dug deeper, going backand carefully rereading the accounts of the Babylonian priest Berossos that Ihad first touched upon when I was researching Fingerprints of the Gods, I wasreminded that Oannes and the Apkallu sages were also sometimes depicted in adifferent therianthropic form, in this case part fish, part human. Each of themwas paired as a “counselor” to an antediluvian King and they were renowned fortheir wisdom in affairs of state and for their skills as architects, buildersand engineers.51 [part0115.html#chapter8-51]Berossos compiled his History from the temple archives of Babylon (reputed tohave contained “public records” that had been preserved for “over 150,000years”52 [part0115.html#chapter8-52]). He has passed on to us a description ofOannes as a “monster,” or a “creature.” However, what Berossos has to say issurely more suggestive of a man wearing some sort of fish-costume—in short, somesort of disguise. The monster, Berossos tells us:had the whole body of a fish, but underneath and attached to the head of thefish there was another head, human, and joined to the tail of the fish, feetlike those of a man, and it had a human voice … At the end of the day, thismonster, Oannes, went back to the sea and spent the night. It was amphibious,able to live both on land and in the sea … Later, other monsters similar toOannes appeared.53 [part0115.html#chapter8-53]Bearing in mind that the curious containers carried by Oannes and the Apkallusages are also depicted on one of the megalithic pillars at Göbekli Tepe (and,as we saw in Chapter One, as far afield as ancient Mexico as well), what are weto make of all this?The mystery deepens when we follow the Mesopotamian traditions further. Insummary, Oannes and the brotherhood of Apkallu sages are depicted as tutoringmankind for many thousands of years. It is during this long passage of time thatthe five antediluvian cities arise, the centers of a great civilization, andthat kingship is “lowered from heaven.” Prior to the first appearance of Oannes,Berossos says, the people of Mesopotamia “lived in a lawless manner, like thebeasts of the field.”54 [part0115.html#chapter8-54]Berossos wrote his History some time between 290 and 278 BC, but only fragmentsof it have come down to us, preserved as quotations and summaries in the worksof other writers such as Syncellus and Eusebius. However, scholars recognizethat what has been transmitted to us in this way does accurately reflect muchmore ancient Mesopotamian traditions inscribed on cuneiform tablets going backto the very earliest times.55 [part0115.html#chapter8-55] For example, the nameOannes, which has perhaps been distorted by the writers who passed it on to us,turns out to be derived from Uannadapa in cuneiform, often abbreviated simply toAdapa or to U-Anna—with the Adapa element originally being a title meaning(appropriately for a sage) “Wise.”56 [part0115.html#chapter8-56] It is said inthe ancient Mesopotamian inscriptions that U-Anna “accomplishes the plans ofheaven and earth.”57 [part0115.html#chapter8-57] Others of the group ofantediluvian sages include U-Anne-dugga “who is endowed with comprehensiveunderstanding” and An-Enlilda, described as “the conjurer of the city ofEridu.”58 [part0115.html#chapter8-58]image [../images/00031.jpeg]Figure 28: Oannes and the brotherhood of Apkallu sages.This last point—that the seven antediluvian sages were “conjurers,” “sorcerers,”“warlocks,” “magicians”—is driven home repeatedly in the cuneiform texts.59[part0115.html#chapter8-59] But at the same time, associated with their magicalabilities are obviously practical, technological or even scientific skills.60[part0115.html#chapter8-60] Thus they were masters of “the chemical recipes,”61[part0115.html#chapter8-61] they were medical doctors,62[part0115.html#chapter8-62] they were carpenters, stone cutters, metal workersand goldsmiths,63 [part0115.html#chapter8-63] and they laid the foundations ofcities.64 [part0115.html#chapter8-64] Indeed, in later times, all crafts used inroyal building and renovation projects were attributed to knowledge that hadoriginated with the antediluvian sages.65 [part0115.html#chapter8-65] As AmarAnnus of the University of Tartu, Estonia, summarizes in a detailed study:The period before the deluge was the one of revelation in the Mesopotamianmythology, when the basis of all later knowledge was laid down. The antediluviansages were culture-heroes, who brought the arts of civilization to the land.During the time that follows this period, nothing new is invented, the originalrevelation is only transmitted and unfolded. Oannes and other sages taught allfoundations of civilization to antediluvian humankind.66[part0115.html#chapter8-66]The cuneiform tablets of ancient Mesopotamia also shed at least some light onthe containers that the Apkallu sages are so often depicted as holding. They arereferred to as banduddu—“buckets,”67 [part0115.html#chapter8-67] and arepresumed to have held “holy water.”68 [part0115.html#chapter8-68] Very often,too, as the reader will recall from Chapter One, the sage holds in his otherhand a cone-like object. These are referred to in the inscriptions asmullilu—meaning “purifiers.”69 [part0115.html#chapter8-69] In the same scenesthe sages frequently appear in conjunction with a stylized tree or sometimeswith the figure of a king, or sometimes both. No specific textual references tothe tree have survived but the general assumption of scholars is that it must bea “sacred tree” while many believe it represents “the tree of life”70[part0115.html#chapter8-70] and that it symbolizes “both the divine world orderand the king, who functioned as its earthly administrator.”71[part0115.html#chapter8-71] The conclusion, therefore, is that we are looking at“a magically protective rite, a benediction, an anointing”:72[part0115.html#chapter8-72]By sprinkling the tree with holy water the sages imparted to it their ownsanctity, upheld the cosmic harmony and thus ensured the correct functioning ofthe plans of heaven and earth.73 [part0115.html#chapter8-73]image [../images/00032.jpeg]Figure 29: Enki, the Sumerian god of wisdom and magic whose specialresponsibility was the subterranean freshwater ocean known as the Abzu. Becauseof this connection with the Abzu he was often depicted with streams of waterbearing fishes flowing from his shoulders. The Akkadians called him Ea.The Seven Apkallus were believed to have been created by Enki (Enki is hisSumerian name; the Akkadians called him Ea), revealed in the Schøyen tablet asZisudra’s patron, the great god of the subterranean freshwater ocean known asthe Abzu.74 [part0115.html#chapter8-74] Enki’s particular attributes, inaddition to his connection to this watery realm, were wisdom, magic, and thearts and crafts of civilization,75 [part0115.html#chapter8-75] so it isappropriate that the sages would be among his creatures and that they wouldfrequently be symbolized as fish. The form of the fish Apkallu, as one scholarnotes:is linked with the secrets that dwell in the deep; and its never-closing,ever-watchful eyes lend it an omniscient sagacity.76 [part0115.html#chapter8-76]Thanks to the advice and teachings of these extraordinary sages, these magiciansof the wisdom-god Enki, we learn from the cuneiform texts that humancivilization achieved rapid technological and scientific advances and entered aphase of “exceptional splendor and plenty, the golden age before the flood.”77[part0115.html#chapter8-77] All seemed to be for the best, in the best of allpossible worlds. But as the millennia passed, mankind fell out of harmony withthe universe and with the deities—and with one deity in particular, the greatEnlil, described as “the King, supreme lord, father and creator,” and (perhapsgiving more sense of his personality) as a “raging storm.”78[part0115.html#chapter8-78] Although the sky god Anu was technically rankedfirst in the Sumerian pantheon, he was usually a rather remote, impotent figure.Enlil was his second in command but in fact responsible for most “executivedecisions.” Enki—nominated in some texts as Enlil’s younger brother—was rankedthird.79 [part0115.html#chapter8-79]image [../images/00033.jpeg]Figure 30: The powerful Sumerian deity Enlil (seated, right). Often described asa “raging storm,” it was he who ordered the extermination of mankind by theagency of the Flood.The Sumerian flood story, as we have seen, has many gaps but other tablets, suchas those containing the Epic of Gilgamesh, arguably the most famous of allsurviving Mesopotamian texts, fill in the details and leave us in no doubt ofEnlil’s role:In those days the world teemed, the people multiplied, the world bellowed like awild bull, and the great god was aroused by the clamor. Enlil heard the clamorand he said to the gods in council, “The uproar of mankind is intolerable andsleep is no longer possible by reason of the babel.” So the gods agreed toexterminate mankind.80 [part0115.html#chapter8-80]We know what happened next. The god Enki (in addition to the Schøyen tablet,other later texts also confirm it was he) intervened to warn Zisudra that theinstrument of extermination, a great, life-destroying flood, was about to beunleashed.81 [part0115.html#chapter8-81] Berossos, who calls Zisudra“Xisouthros,” gives us the next chapter of the story:[Enki] appeared to Xisouthros in a dream and revealed that … mankind would bedestroyed by a great flood. He then ordered him to bury together all thetablets, the first, the middle and the last, and hide them in Sippar, the cityof the sun. Then he was to build a boat and board it with his family and hisbest friends. He was to provision it with food and drink and also take on boardwild animals and birds and all four-footed animals. Then, when all was prepared,he was to make ready to sail … He did not stop working until the ship was built.Its length was five stades [3,000 feet or 914 meters] and its breadth two stades[1,200 feet or 366 meters]. He boarded the finished ship, equipped foreverything as he had been commanded, with his wife, children and closestfriends …82 [part0115.html#chapter8-82]The surviving fragments of Berossos do not tell us of the experience of theFlood, but the Epic of Gilgamesh does, putting the words into the mouth ofZisudra/Xisouthros himself:83 [part0115.html#chapter8-83]For six days and nights the wind blew, torrent and tempest and flood overwhelmedthe world, tempest and flood raged together like warring hosts. When the seventhday dawned the storm from the south subsided, the sea grew calm, the flood wasstilled. I looked at the face of the world and there was silence. The surface ofthe sea stretched as flat as a rooftop. All mankind had returned to clay … Iopened a hatch and light fell on my face. Then I bowed low, I sat down and Iwept, the tears streamed down my face, for on every side was a waste of water …Fourteen leagues distant there appeared a mountain, and there the boatgrounded …84 [part0115.html#chapter8-84]Berossos again:Then Xisouthros knew that the earth had once again appeared … He disembarked,accompanied by his wife and daughter together with the steersman. He prostratedhimself in worship of the earth and set up an altar and sacrificed to the gods.After this he disappeared together with those who had left the ship with him.Those who had remained on the ship and had not gone out with Xisouthros …searched for him and called out for him by name all about. But Xisouthros fromthen on was seen no more, and then the sound of a voice that came out of the airgave instruction that it was their duty to honor the gods and that Xisouthros,because of the great honor he had shown the gods, had gone to the dwelling placeof the gods and that his wife and daughter and the steersman had enjoyed thesame honor. The voice then instructed them to return to … the city of Sippar, todig up the tablets that were buried there and to turn them over to mankind. Theplace where they had come to rest was in the land of Armenia.85[part0115.html#chapter8-85]So, in summary, both the Biblical and Mesopotamian accounts agree that Armeniawas the place of refuge for the survivors of the Flood. Berossos, however, addssome important details missing from the Old Testament story. These are, first,the reference to Sippar, which, as we’ve seen, was one of the five antediluviancities remembered in Sumerian traditions; secondly, the intriguing informationthat writings or archives from antediluvian times (“all the tablets, the first,the middle and the last”) were buried at Sippar before the Flood struck; andthirdly that the survivors were to return to Sippar when the waters had recededin order to dig up the buried tablets and “turn them over to mankind.”image [../images/00034.jpeg]Figure 31: The Sumerian Flood survivor and the Ark: “The surface of the seastretched as flat as a rooftop. All mankind had returned to clay … Fourteenleagues distant there appeared a mountain, and there the boat grounded.”What is envisaged here, therefore, is nothing less than a renewal ofcivilization after a global cataclysm—a renewal in which antediluvian knowledgewas to be recovered and repromulgated. The Seven Sages, however, would no longerhave any part to play in the spread of that knowledge. The cuneiform texts tellus that they had been sent back to the depths of the Abzu at the time of theFlood and ordered never to return.86 [part0115.html#chapter8-86] Other sages “ofhuman descent”—though in one case described as being “two-thirds Apkallu”87[part0115.html#chapter8-87]—would take their place, some continuity would bemaintained and civilization would rise again. In due course, later kings wouldspeak of their link to the antediluvian world. In the late first millenium BC,Nebuchadnezzar I of Babylon described himself as a “seed preserved from beforethe flood”88 [part0115.html#chapter8-88] while Ashurbanipal, who ruled thecentral Mesopotamian empire of Assyria in the seventh century BC, boasted: “Ilearned the craft of Adapa, the sage, which is the secret knowledge … I am wellacquainted with the signs of heaven and earth … I am enjoying the writings onstones from before the flood.”89 [part0115.html#chapter8-89]It is a curious mystery, as we shall see in the next chapter, that the exactsame notions of the Seven Sages as the bringers of civilization in the remotestantiquity, and of the preservation and repromulgation of “writings on stonesfrom before the flood,” turn up in the supposedly completely distinct andunrelated culture of Ancient Egypt."},{"pageContent":" Part IV [part0131.html#c_part4]Resurrection [part0131.html#c_part4]"},{"pageContent":" Chapter 9 [part0131.html#c_ch9]Island of the Ka [part0131.html#c_ch9]The banks of the Nile are lush, lined with palms and green fields, but they arenarrow, won from the surrounding deserts thanks only to the gift of fertilitybestowed upon them by the eternal river. It’s the same story all the way fromCairo to Aswan, where the High Dam has permanently changed the divine landscapeof the pharaohs by creating Lake Nasser, one of the largest man-made bodies ofwater in the world, which continues south to cross the border with the Sudan. Asthe level of the lake rose during the 1960s many Ancient Egyptian sites, such asthe Fortress of Buhen, were submerged. Others such as world-famous Abu Simbel,and the stunningly beautiful little Temple of Isis at Philae, were rescued bybeing moved block by block and re-erected on higher ground.Others still were dismantled and shipped overseas—for example the Temple ofDendur, now in New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Temple of Debod, nowin the Parque del Oeste in Madrid, and the Temple of Taffeh, now in theRijksmuseum Van Oudheden in Leiden, in the Netherlands. By such means, thesacred realm of the gods that continuously remade and remanifested itself inEgypt over untold thousands of years in antiquity can be said still to undergoresurrection and rebirth in far-off lands even today.So it was, too, according to its own inscriptions, with the Temple of Horus atEdfu. Known as Behdet in ancient times (hence its patron, the falcon god Horus,is often referred to as Horus the Behdetite) Edfu stands on the west bank of theNile 110 kilometers (68 miles) north of Aswan and was thus spared from floodingby Lake Nasser. The temple as we see it today, its golden sandstone blocksradiant and graceful beneath the fierce sun of Upper Egypt, is relatively young,the whole complex having been completed during the Ptolemaic period in a seriesof stages between 237 BC and 57 BC.1 [part0116.html#chapter9-1] In everymeaningful sense, however, what confronts us here is merely the latestincarnation of much older temples that previously occupied this site dating atleast to the Old Kingdom (2575-2134 BC)2 [part0116.html#chapter9-2]—and perhapsfar beyond.image [../images/00035.jpeg]Figure 32Of the greatest interest, at any rate, is the temple’s idea of itself expressedin the acres of enigmatic inscriptions that cover its walls. These inscriptions,the so-called Edfu Building Texts, take us back to a very remote period calledthe “Early Primeval Age of the Gods”3 [part0116.html#chapter9-3]—and these gods,it transpires, were not originally Egyptian,4 [part0116.html#chapter9-4] butlived on a sacred island, the “Homeland of the Primeval Ones,” in the midst of agreat ocean.5 [part0116.html#chapter9-5] Then, at some unspecified time in thepast, a terrible disaster—a true cataclysm of flood and fire as we shallsee—overtook this island, where “the earliest mansions of the gods” had beenfounded,6 [part0116.html#chapter9-6] destroying it utterly, inundating all itsholy places and killing most of its divine inhabitants.7[part0116.html#chapter9-7] Some survived, however, and we are told that thisremnant set sail in their ships (for the texts leave us in no doubt these godsof the early primeval age were navigators8 [part0116.html#chapter9-8]) to“wander” the world.9 [part0116.html#chapter9-9]Their purpose in doing so was nothing less than to recreate and revivify theessence of their lost homeland,10 [part0116.html#chapter9-10] to bring about, inshort:The resurrection of the former world of the gods …11 [part0116.html#chapter9-11]The re-creation of a destroyed world.12 [part0116.html#chapter9-12]The general tone, as Egyptologist Eve Anne Elizabeth Reymond confirms in hermasterful study of the Edfu Building Texts, conveys the view that “an ancientworld, having been constituted, was destroyed and as a dead world it came to bethe basis of a new period of creation which at first was the re-creation andresurrection of what once had existed in the past.”13[part0116.html#chapter9-13]Important in the evaluation of the texts is the realization that they were notcomposed in the historical temple. On the contrary, as Reymond informs us, thepriests and scribes of Edfu merely copied what they regarded as the moreimportant extracts from a vast archive of ancient documents that they had attheir disposal.14 [part0116.html#chapter9-14] By the fifth century AD the weightof Roman and Christian fanaticism had brought about the final collapse ofAncient Egyptian civilization.15 [part0116.html#chapter9-15] Thereafter (withIslamic hatred of the past soon making things even worse) care ceased to betaken of the temples which were used as storerooms, stables and homes by localpeople who no longer venerated the ancient gods. In 1837 the English explorerHoward Vyse visited Edfu and described the mess that he found inside:The temple itself, one of the most imposing in Egypt, affords a strikingcontrast to the miserable hovels, many of which are built upon it, and others onvast mounds of rubbish with which it is surrounded. The interior, covered withpainted hieroglyphics, has been divided by earthen walls to form a magazine forcorn, and beneath it are enormous substructions which I entered by a hole froman Arab house. They were full of dirt and filth of every description, but hadbeen built in the most solid manner …16 [part0116.html#chapter9-16]Fortunate for us, then, when Edfu still thrived, that priests and scribes whocould read the mysterious texts in the temple’s library committed themselves tothe project of selecting extracts and carving them deeply into the “solid” and“imposing” walls of the temple itself. In so doing, whether by accident ordesign, they ensured that at least these fragments have survived to the presentday, whereas the original source documents—looted, used as kindling, thrown intothe Nile during the centuries of neglect and mistreatment—have long gone.Inevitably, since they lack their original context, the fragments are oftenconfusing and deeply tantalizing. Even so, they give us a glimpse into wondersand secrets of our past that the source documents—if only we had them!—mighthave revealed to us much more completely.Atlantis in EgyptThe famed Greek philosopher Plato, who passed down to us the extraordinary storyof Atlantis destroyed in a terrible cataclysm of flood and fire 9,000 yearsbefore the time of Solon—i.e. in 9600 BC in our calendar—is generally regardedby archaeologists as having made up the whole tale of the lost Ice Agecivilization. The fallback position, among those grudgingly willing to admitsome veracity to the information conveyed in the Timaeus and Critias, is thatPlato had perhaps based his account on a much more recent cataclysm centered onthe Mediterranean—for example the eruption of Thera (Santorini) in themid-second millenium BC. The notion of a global disaster more than 11,000 yearsago, and particularly the heretical idea that it could have wiped out a highcivilization of that epoch, is strenuously resisted and indeed ridiculed by thearchaeological establishment because, of course, archaeologists claim to “know”that there was not, and never under any circumstances could have been, a highcivilization at that time.They “know” this not because of any hard evidence which absolutely rules out theexistence of an Atlantis-type civilization in the Upper Paleolithic, but ratheron the general principle that the result of less than two hundred years of“scientific” archaeology is an agreed time-line for civilization that sees ourancestors moving smoothly out of the Upper Palaeolithic, into the Neolithic(both, by definition, Stone Age cultures) at around 9600 BC, and thence onwardthrough the development and perfection of agriculture in the millennia thatfollowed—a process that also witnessed the founding of some very large permanentsettlements such as Catalhoyuk in Turkey around 7500 BC.By about 4000 BC the increasing sophistication of economic and socialstructures, and growing organizational abilities, made possible the creation ofthe earliest megalithic sites (such as Gigantija on the Maltese island of Gozo,for example) while the first city-states emerged around 3500 BC in Mesopotamiaand the Indus Valley and soon afterward in Egypt and on the other side of theworld in Peru.17 [part0116.html#chapter9-17] The Pyramids of Giza are megalithicmonuments; so too the Great Sphinx. In the British Isles, Callanish in the OuterHebrides and Avebury in southwest England, both dated to around 3000 BC, are theoldest examples of true megalithic sites. The megalithic phase of Stonehenge isthought to have begun around 2400 BC and to have continued to around 1800 BC.Within this well-worked-out and long-established chronology there is simply noroom for any prehistoric civilization such as Atlantis, hence the wish of themainstream to dismiss Plato’s “outlandish” story by any and every possiblemeans. These means include ridicule of the supposed “Egyptian” basis for thetale—specifically, of the claim, made in the Timaeus, that priests of Sais inthe Delta said Atlantis, and its cruel fate, were described in “sacredrecords”18 [part0116.html#chapter9-18] in their Temple going back thousands ofyears before the established beginning of Egyptian civilization in the latefourth millenium BC.19 [part0116.html#chapter9-19] To those wedded to theorthodox chronology, the very idea that the priests of Sais might have givenSolon a true account of such “impossible” records, which in due course reachedPlato, seems preposterous—an obvious historical oxymoron which deserves only tobe ignored. Furthermore the claim is frequently made that there are noreferences to Atlantis anywhere in surviving Ancient Egyptian papyri andinscriptions.Only one Egyptologist, the late Professor John Gwyn Griffiths of the Universityof Wales at Swansea (who passed away in 2004) had the courage to challenge theconsensus. The challenge he presented, however, had nothing to do with thefundamental point of whether Atlantis existed and was destroyed in the tenthmillenium BC, but rather with the lesser point of whether Plato, through hisancestor Solon, could indeed have been influenced by genuine Ancient Egyptiantraditions.20 [part0116.html#chapter9-20] Oddly enough for so learned a man,Griffiths seems to have known nothing of Edfu with its tempting account of asacred island inhabited by “gods” and destroyed by flood and fire in primevaltimes—an obvious prototype for Plato’s Atlantis, as we shall see. TheProfessor’s focus, instead, was on a papyrus, catalogued as P. Leningrad 1115and now kept in Moscow, which contains an intriguing prose story known as theTale of the Shipwrecked Sailor. In this “fairytale,” dating to Egypt’s MiddleKingdom between 2000 BC and 1700 BC, Griffiths—quite correctly in my view—didfind convincing resemblances to Plato’s account of Atlantis.The eponymous “shipwrecked sailor” in the papyrus tells us of a time when hemade a voyage in a great ocean-going vessel that was struck by a giant wave:Then the ship died. Of those in it not one remained. I was cast on an island bythe sea. I spent three days alone … Lying in the shelter of trees, I hugged theshade … Then I stretched my legs to discover what I might put in my mouth. Ifound figs and grapes there, all sorts of fine vegetables, sycamore figs … andcucumbers that were as if tended. Fish there were and fowl; there is nothingthat was not there. I stuffed myself and put some down, because I had too muchin my arms.21 [part0116.html#chapter9-21]The shipwrecked sailor cuts a fire drill, makes fire and gives a burned offeringto the gods:Then I heard a thundering noise … Trees splintered, the ground trembled.Uncovering my face, I found it was a snake that was coming. He was of thirtycubits [15 meters or 50 feet] … His body was overlaid with gold; his eyebrowswere of real lapis lazuli … Then he took me in his mouth and carried me to theplace where he lived, and set me down unhurt …22 [part0116.html#chapter9-22]The serpent questions the sailor on how he came to be on the island and onhearing his reply, tells him not to be afraid:It is a god who has let you live and brought you to this Island of the Ka. Thereis nothing that is not upon it; it is full of good things …The name “Island of the Ka” is “curious” notes Miriam Lichtheim, the translatorof the tale. She adds that the renowned Egyptologist Sir Alan Gardiner “renderedit as ‘phantom island.’”23 [part0116.html#chapter9-23] It is beyond the scope ofthis book to present a detailed treatise on the concept of the Ka—the “double,”the astral or spiritual essence of a person or thing. It existed with the humanbeing during his or her mortal life but was “the superior power in the realmsbeyond the grave.” Indeed, the term for death in the Ancient Egyptian languagemeant “Going to one’s ka,” or “Going to one’s ka in the sky.”24[part0116.html#chapter9-24] The gods were also believed to have their kas andso, too, were the great monuments of Egypt. Of particular relevance here is thatthe high god Osiris, lord of the celestial afterlife kingdom known as the Duat,was always referred to as “the Ka of the Pyramids” of Giza:25[part0116.html#chapter9-25]The Ka entered eternity before its human host, having served its function bywalking at the human’s side to urge kindness, quietude, honor and compassion.Throughout the life of the human, the Ka was the conscience, the guardian, theguide. After death, however, the Ka became supreme …26[part0116.html#chapter9-26]With this in mind, Gardiner’s suggestion that a “phantom island” is implicatedin the Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor, makes sense. The sailor has set out in aboat from the physical realm of Middle Kingdom Egypt, but he has been castashore on “the Island of the Ka,” a ghost realm—a place that no longer exists inthis world except in the form of its spiritual essence.The same theme continues as the huge snake that rules the island tells thesailor his sad story:I was here with my brothers and there were children with them. In all we wereseventy-five serpents, children and brothers without mentioning a littledaughter whom I had obtained through prayer. Then a star fell, and they went upin flames through it. It so happened that I was not with them in the fire. I wasnot among them. I could have died for their sake when I found them as one heapof corpses.27 [part0116.html#chapter9-27]In due course a ship passes by and the sailor is rescued. The snake-king of theisland sends him away with rich presents—myrrh, oils, laudanum, spices,“perfume, eye-paint, giraffe’s tails, great lumps of incense, elephant’s tusks,grayhounds, monkeys, baboons, and all kinds of precious things.”28[part0116.html#chapter9-28] The sailor, filled with gratitude, wants to returnwith gifts from Egypt, but before he boards the ship the serpent takes him asideand tells him:When you have left this place, you will not see this island again; it will havebecome water.29 [part0116.html#chapter9-29]The comparisons with Plato’s story of Atlantis that John Gwyn Griffiths drawsrelate primarily to the rich variety of plant and animal life, including theelephants said to be found on both islands. Here’s Plato on Atlantis:There were a great number of elephants in the island; for as there was provisionfor all other sorts of animals, both for those which live in lakes and marshesand rivers, and also for those which live in mountains and on plains, so therewas for the animal which is the largest and most voracious of all. Also whateverfragrant things there now are in the earth, whether roots, or herbage, or woods,or essences which distil from fruit and flower, grew and thrived in that land;also the fruit which admits of cultivation, both the dry sort, which is given usfor nourishment and any other which we use for food—we call them all by thecommon name “pulse”—and the fruits having a hard rind, affording drinks andmeats and ointments … all these that sacred island which then beheld the lightof the sun, brought forth fair and wondrous and in infinite abundance. With suchblessings the earth freely furnished them …30 [part0116.html#chapter9-30]In addition there is the fact that Atlantis is a sacred island and so, too, ofcourse, is the Island of the Ka, to which the shipwrecked sailor has beenbrought by a god. The closest resemblance by far, however, is in the fate ofAtlantis which was “swallowed up by the sea and vanished,”31[part0116.html#chapter9-31] just as the Island of the Ka would never be seenagain because it had “become water.”Taking such elements into account Griffiths concludes that although Plato’sstory may “not derive from Egypt in toto,” it nonetheless, most certainly owes a“conceptual debt to Egypt.”32 [part0116.html#chapter9-32] His argument is wellmade, but if he had been familiar with the Edfu Building Texts he might, Ithink, have stated his case more strongly.Bringing some threads togetherWe no longer have access to the sacred records once kept at the Temple of Saisin the Delta that Plato tells us contained the story of Atlantis. That temple,which Solon visited around 600 BC, was dedicated to the goddess Neith and wasextremely ancient, dating back at least as far as the First Dynasty, circa 3200BC.33 [part0116.html#chapter9-33] Unfortunately it had been completely destroyedby AD 1400, leaving only rubbish heaps and a few scattered blocks on the sitethat is today occupied by the village of Sa el Hagar.34[part0116.html#chapter9-34] At Edfu, on the other hand, although the originalsacred records are also gone, the extracts preserved in the Building Texts doseem to tell essentially the same story that Solon heard and passed on to Platoand that Griffiths argues also reaches us, albeit in a more fragmentary andliterary form, in the Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor.We’ve already seen that the Homeland of the Primeval Ones in the Edfu texts isdescribed as a sacred island in the midst of a great ocean, so a comparison tothe Island of the Ka in the Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor is obvious at thelevel of the basic geographical setting. The resemblance goes deeper than this,however, since there are many passages in the Building Texts which make it clearthat the first and original god who presided over the Homeland of the PrimevalOnes was “a dead deity, the Ka.”35 [part0116.html#chapter9-35] Indeed, we readthat the island was also known as the “Home of the Ka”36[part0116.html#chapter9-36] and that “the Ka ruled therein”37[part0116.html#chapter9-37]—“this Ka who dwelt among the reeds of the island.”38[part0116.html#chapter9-38] In other words, the Homeland of the Primeval Ones inthe Edfu texts is nothing more nor less than the Island of the Ka and, to theextent that Griffiths is correct to see a prototype for Plato’s Atlantis in theIsland of the Ka, then the Homeland of the Primeval Ones is also a prototype.What helps to firm up the comparison are certain details given in the BuildingTexts that do not appear in the Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor. Of particularinterest is a passage at Edfu in which we read of a circular, water-filled“channel” surrounding the original sacred domain that lay at the heart of theisland of the Primeval Ones—a ring of water that was intended to fortify andprotect that domain.39 [part0116.html#chapter9-39] In this there is, of course,a direct parallel to Atlantis, where the sacred domain on which stood the templeand palace of the god, whom Plato names as “Poseidon,” was likewise surroundedby a ring of water, itself placed in the midst of further such concentric ringsseparated by rings of land, again with the purpose of fortification andprotection.40 [part0116.html#chapter9-40]Other details are found in all three stories. For example, the striking parallelbetween the inundation of the island of Atlantis as Plato recounts it, and theinundation of the Island of the Ka in the Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor, iseerily duplicated in the inundation of the Homeland of the Primeval Ones asdescribed in the Edfu texts where we read of an upheaval:so violent that it destroyed the sacred land …41 [part0116.html#chapter9-41] Theprimeval water … submerged the island … and the island became the tomb of theoriginal divine inhabitants …42 [part0116.html#chapter9-42] the Homeland endedin darkness beneath the primeval waters.43 [part0116.html#chapter9-43]Compare this with Plato who tells us of “earthquakes and floods of extraordinaryviolence”44 [part0116.html#chapter9-44] as a result of which:in a single terrible day and night … the island of Atlantis was … swallowed upby the sea and vanished.45 [part0116.html#chapter9-45]Intriguingly, Plato also hints at the immediate cause of the earthquakes andfloods that destroyed Atlantis. In the Timaeus, as a prelude to his account ofthe lost civilization and its demise, he reports that the Egyptian priests fromwhom Solon received the story began by speaking of a celestial cataclysm:There have been and will be many different calamities to destroy mankind, thegreatest of them being by fire and water, lesser ones by countless other means.Your own [i.e. the Greeks’] story of how Phaethon, child of the sun, harnessedhis father’s chariot, but was unable to guide it along his father’s course andso burned up things on earth and was himself destroyed by a thunderbolt, is amythical version of the truth that there is at long intervals a variation in thecourse of the heavenly bodies and a consequent widespread destruction by fire ofthings on earth.46 [part0116.html#chapter9-46]In the Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor, too, we find that a celestial cataclysmplays a part. As the reader will recall, the serpent king speaks of thedestruction of his race when “a star fell, and they went up in flames throughit.” The same ominous agency turns up in the Edfu Building Texts where a serpentis again invoked, but with the significant twist that here it is not the sad andwise ruler of the island but rather the fatal “enemy” of the island and itsdivine inhabitants.47 [part0116.html#chapter9-47] To place what the Edfu textshave to say about this in a wider context, let us first revisit the Zoroastriantradition of an “evil spirit” that:sprang like a snake out of the sky down to the earth … He rushed in at noon, andthereby the sky was as shattered and frightened by him as a sheep by a wolf. Hecame onto the water which was arranged below the earth, and then the middle ofthis earth was pierced and entered by him … He rushed out upon the wholecreation and he made the world quite as injured and dark at midday as though itwere dark night.48 [part0116.html#chapter9-48]To my mind, as I argued in Chapter Seven, what we have here is “a mythicalversion of the truth”—with the underlying truth being a cataclysmic encounterwith a comet. Now let’s look at the relevant passages from the Edfu BuildingTexts where a snake called the nhp-wer, the “Great Leaping One,” is described as“the chief enemy of the god.”49 [part0116.html#chapter9-49] It is his “assault”that causes the Homeland of the Primeval Ones to be swallowed up by the sea, butfirst the feet of the deity of the island—the Ka, here explicitly described asthe “Earth God”50 [part0116.html#chapter9-50]—are “pierced, and the domain wassplit.”51 [part0116.html#chapter9-51]This, as Reymond comments:is a clear picture of a disaster … It destroyed the sacred land with the resultthat its divine inhabitants died. This interpretation accords with other partsof the first Edfu record which allude to the death of the “Company” [a group ofdivine beings] and to the darkness that covered the primeval island.52[part0116.html#chapter9-52]Multiple threads seem to come together here: Plato’s variation in the course ofheavenly bodies leading to widespread destruction on earth, the murderousfalling star in the Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor, the snake of Zoroastriantradition that springs out of the sky, pierces the earth and makes the worlddark, and the Great Leaping Serpent of the Edfu texts whose assault pierces thefeet of the Earth God, leads to death for the divine Company and cloaks theprimeval island in darkness. I’m reminded, too, of the Ojibwa “myth” reported inChapter Three of the “star with the long wide tail that came down here once,thousands of years ago”—a “star” specifically recognized as a comet,53[part0116.html#chapter9-53] that caused “the first flooding of the earth.” 54[part0116.html#chapter9-54]Comet and asteroid impacts not only cause floods but can also impose hugestresses on the crust of the earth resulting in increased earthquake andvolcanic activity. How likely, therefore, is it to be an accident that Plato,who was at pains to preface his story with the “thunderbolts” of Phaethon,implicated both earthquakes and floods in the demise of Atlantis and carefullydated the whole episode to 9,000 years before the time of Solon, i.e. 9600 BC? Isuggest there’s a real possibility that all these traditions are pointing to thesame horrific epoch of prehistory.This epoch, as I’ve argued in earlier chapters, is the Younger Dryas which begancataclysmically 12,800 years ago and ended equally cataclysmically 11,600 yearsago with large-scale floods—associated with the cascading collapse of the NorthAmerican and northern European ice caps—occurring at both dates. The case formultiple impacts from a large, fragmented comet initiating the Younger Dryas is,I believe, a very strong one. In the light of the mythological evidence, thepossibility must also be considered that it was further encounters with theorbiting debris stream of the same giant comet that brought the Younger Dryas toan end.In the process, I suggest, as so many myths and traditions from all around theworld maintain, an advanced civilization was lost to history.Mystery of the Sound EyeArchaeology is not wrong when it tells us that most of the world in the epoch of12,800 to 11,600 years ago, was populated by hunter-gatherers, locked in theStone Age and lacking even the beginnings of agriculture. But Plato, to theeternal frustration of archaeologists, leaves us in no doubt that Atlantis wasvery different. In brief, it was a great and wonderful empire commanding a largenavy of ocean-going ships that gave it the ability to project its power intoAfrica as far as Egypt, into Europe as far as Italy,55[part0116.html#chapter9-55] and onto the mainland of what Plato calls “the wholeopposite continent”—by which many believe he meant the Americas56[part0116.html#chapter9-56]—“which surrounds what can truly be called theocean.”57 [part0116.html#chapter9-57] Atlantis was a fully-developed city-state,drawing its wealth from a mature and prosperous agricultural economy andboasting advanced metallurgy and sophisticated architectural and engineeringworks, all enhanced by an immense wealth of natural resources:With such blessings the earth freely furnished them; meanwhile they went onconstructing their temples and palaces and harbors and docks. And they arrangedthe whole country in the following manner: First of all they bridged over thezones of sea which surrounded the ancient metropolis, making a road to and fromthe royal palace … which they continued to ornament in successive generations …until they made the building a marvel to behold for size and for beauty.And beginning from the sea they bored a canal of three hundred feet in width andone hundred feet in depth and fifty stadia in length, which they carried throughto the outermost zone, making a passage from the sea up to this, which became aharbor, and leaving an opening sufficient to enable the largest vessels to findingress. Moreover, they divided at the bridges the zones of land which partedthe zones of sea, leaving room for a single trireme to pass out of one zone intoanother, and they covered over the channels so as to leave a way underneath forthe ships; for the banks were raised considerably above the water.Now the largest of the zones into which a passage was cut from the sea was threestadia in breadth, and the zone of land which came next of equal breadth; butthe next two zones, the one of water, the other of land, were two stadia, andthe one which surrounded the central island was a stadium only in width. Theisland in which the palace was situated had a diameter of five stadia. All thisincluding the zones and the bridge, which was the sixth part of a stadium inwidth, they surrounded by a stone wall on every side, placing towers and gateson the bridges where the sea passed in.The stone which was used in the work they quarried from underneath the centerisland, and from underneath the zones, on the outer as well as the inner side.One kind was white, another black, and a third red, and as they quarried, theyat the same time hollowed out double docks, having roofs formed out of thenative rock. Some of their buildings were simple, but in others they puttogether different stones, varying the color to please the eye, and to be anatural source of delight. The entire circuit of the wall, which went round theoutermost zone, they covered with a coating of brass, and the circuit of thenext wall they coated with tin, and the third, which encompassed the citadel,flashed with the red light of orichalcum.58 [part0116.html#chapter9-58]Nobody now knows exactly what metal the fabled orichalcum of Atlantis was, sincePlato tells us that it survived in his day “only in name,”59[part0116.html#chapter9-59] but it adds to the aura of technological masterythat still surrounds the fabled lost civilization.Seagoing navigation, advanced agriculture and large-scale architectural andengineering works are also among the notable characteristics of the Homeland ofthe Primeval Ones described in the Edfu texts. We have already seen how the ringsystem of canals is prefigured there but so too are the grand temples ofAtlantis. We read, for example, of a chapel “measuring 90 by 20 cubits”(approximately 45 by 10 meters or 150 by 35 feet):At its front was erected a large forecourt of 90 by 90 cubits … Then a hypostylehall of 50 by 30 cubits was constructed … then another hall of 20 by 30 cubitsand two consecutive halls, each 45 by 20 cubits were added at the front of thefirst hypostyle hall.60 [part0116.html#chapter9-60]An enclosure is described measuring 300 cubits (150 meters or 500 feet) fromwest to east and 400 cubits from north to south. Within it is a temple, the“Mansion of the God” and within that a Holy of Holies measuring 90 cubits fromeast to west.61 [part0116.html#chapter9-61]We also read of a third enclosure on the same grand scale of 300 by 400 cubits.It too contains an inner sanctuary measuring 90 cubits from west to east and 20cubits from north to south, subdivided into three rooms each of which was 30cubits by 20 cubits.62 [part0116.html#chapter9-62]But the strongest hint of high technology in the Homeland of the Primeval Onesis given in one of the Edfu extracts that describes the cataclysmic demise ofthe island following the assault of the celestial “snake” called “the GreatLeaping One” that “pierces” the Earth God and “splits” the domain. Then weread—and it is most mysterious—that “the Sound Eye fell.”63[part0116.html#chapter9-63]“The mention of the Sound Eye … appears a little strange,” admits Reymond. Butshe explains, though the texts are obscure on the point, that it seems to be:the name of the center of the light which illumined the island.64[part0116.html#chapter9-64]We are, in short, to envisage some artificial system of illumination whichlights up the primeval island of the gods. Beyond that:All that can be said, with due reserve, is that it looks as though there is anallusion to a disaster which caused the fall of the Sound Eye, with the resultthat complete darkness fell upon the domain of the Creator.65[part0116.html#chapter9-65]The gods sailed …What happened after the disaster that struck Atlantis? Were there survivors? Ifthere were, what did they do with the advanced knowledge that they possessed?Plato’s Timaeus and Critias provide no answers to these questions, but the EdfuBuilding Texts do, making it clear that there were survivors of the disasterthat struck the Homeland of the Primeval Ones—“companies of gods” who werealready at sea when the sacred island was flooded. They sailed back to theformer location of the island after the cataclysm but:saw only reeds on the surface of the water.66 [part0116.html#chapter9-66]There was a great deal of mud there also,67 [part0116.html#chapter9-67] a scenereminiscent of Plato’s description of the vicinity of Atlantis after the flood:the sea in that area is impassable to navigation, which is hindered by mud justbelow the surface, the remains of the sunken island.68[part0116.html#chapter9-68]In the case of the Homeland of the Primeval Ones it seems that enough of thesunken island remained close to the surface for the survivors to attempt to winsome of it back from the sea—an endeavor referred to in the Edfu texts as the“creation of the pãy-lands,” where the term “pãy-land” clearly means landsreclaimed from the sea.69 [part0116.html#chapter9-69] Thus we read how “theShebtiw recited sacred spells, the water gradually receded from the edge of theisland, and the actual land of the pãy-land was brought out.”70[part0116.html#chapter9-70] The texts then describe:a process of … continuous creation by the emergence of a progressive series ofplots of land …71 [part0116.html#chapter9-71] The creation of these … sacreddomains was, in fact, a resurrection and restoration of what had been in thepast but had vanished …72 [part0116.html#chapter9-72] At the end there appearedfurther pãy-lands which brought to a new life the former homeland.73[part0116.html#chapter9-73]Nonetheless, despite these efforts, the fact remained that the cataclysm had soutterly devastated the primeval island that no amount of reclamation couldrestore it to its former glory. The only solution for the survivors, therefore,was to attempt to recreate it elsewhere in regions that had not been as badlyaffected by the catastrophe. The result saw the beginning of a great project ofwhich the world we live in today is the result. What the Edfu texts say,explains Reymond, is:that the gods left the original pãy-lands …74 [part0116.html#chapter9-74] They …sailed to another part of the primeval world …75 [part0116.html#chapter9-75][and] journeyed through the … lands of the primeval age …76[part0116.html#chapter9-76] In any place in which they settled they founded newsacred domains.77 [part0116.html#chapter9-77]Their mission, in short, was to repromulgate the lost civilization and the lostreligion of the days before the flood. As Reymond puts it, this “second era ofthe primeval age” saw “the development of the domains that survived inhistorical times.”78 [part0116.html#chapter9-78]Begin again like childrenThe Edfu texts make allusion to the smd, “wandering,” of the “company of gods”79[part0116.html#chapter9-79] who initiated the civilizing project. Their leaderwas the Falcon Horus, after whom the temple at Edfu was much later dedicated,but present, also, was Thoth, the god of wisdom.80 [part0116.html#chapter9-80]Accompanying Horus and Thoth were the Shebtiw, a group of deities charged with aspecific responsibility for “creation,”81 [part0116.html#chapter9-81] the“Builder Gods” who accomplished “the actual work of building,”82[part0116.html#chapter9-82] and the “Seven Sages.”83 [part0116.html#chapter9-83]This is a matter of interest in the light of the Mesopotamian traditions of theApkallus explored in Chapter Eight and it seems that something more thancoincidence is involved.The reader will recall that the Apkallus were often depicted as hybridcreatures, part bird of prey, part human in appearance. Similarly, the SevenSages of the Edfu texts are described as primeval deities who were capable ofassuming “the form of falcons” and of “resembling falcons.”84[part0116.html#chapter9-84]Also exactly like the antediluvian Apkallus, the Seven Sages of the Edfu texts(who are not mentioned elsewhere in Ancient Egyptian inscriptions) were themagicians among the gods. They were seers who could foretell the future,85[part0116.html#chapter9-85] and they could swr iht ti—“endue with power thesubstances of the earth”86 [part0116.html#chapter9-86]—a process of creation “bythe word of the creators”87 [part0116.html#chapter9-87] that, Reymond notes,“has no equivalent.”88 [part0116.html#chapter9-88] They were, in addition,believed to have the ability “to magnify things,” and thus to provide magicalprotection.89 [part0116.html#chapter9-89] On this point, the best sense Reymondis able to make of what she describes as an “unusually obscure” text, is that“the protection was constituted by means of symbols. The magical power ofprotecting was conferred by a giving of names.”90 [part0116.html#chapter9-90]The Apkallus mingled their magic with practical skills—such as laying thefoundations of cities and temples. Similarly, the Seven Sages of the Edfu textsalso had their practical, architectural side and many passages testify to theirinvolvement in the setting out and construction of buildings and in the layingof foundations.91 [part0116.html#chapter9-91] Moreover, the Egyptians believedthat “the ground plans of the historical temples were established according towhat the Sages of the primeval age revealed to Thoth.”92[part0116.html#chapter9-92]This hint of a special connection between the Sages and Thoth is, of course, afurther parallel for, as we’ve seen, the Apkallus were linked to Enki, theMesopotamian god of wisdom. In the Mesopotamian inscriptions, however, Enki isclearly superior to the Sages—indeed, he is their maker. But in the Edfu texts,strangely, it appears that the knowledge of the Sages is regarded as superior tothat of the wisdom-god Thoth. Indeed, it was the tradition at Edfu that theoriginal records and archives from which the texts were extracted were nothingless than “the words of the Sages” given as dictation to Thoth, who had thenconsigned them to writing.93 [part0116.html#chapter9-93] The texts furtherdisclose that the Sages of the mythical age were believed to be “the only divinebeings who knew how the temples and sacred places were created”94[part0116.html#chapter9-94] and were themselves the very creators ofknowledge,95 [part0116.html#chapter9-95] which thereafter could only be passedon but not invented anew. This finds parallels in the Mesopotamian notion thatsince the time of the antediluvian Apkallus nothing new had been invented—withthe original revelation simply being retransmitted and unfolded in later epochs.Without laboring the point further, therefore, it seems to me that the ideaconveyed so strongly in the cuneiform inscriptions of ancient Mesopotamia of aproject to recover and repromulgate antediluvian knowledge after a globalcataclysm is, rather exactly, the same project that is set out in the EdfuBuilding Texts, which in turn bear uncanny and troubling resemblances to Plato’sreport of the destroyed Ice Age civilization of Atlantis.More than that, the Edfu texts invite us to consider the possibility that thesurvivors of the lost civilization, thought of as “gods” but manifestlyhuman—albeit with mysterious “powers”—set about “wandering” the world after theflood. By happenstance it was only hunter-gatherer populations, the peoples ofthe mountains and the deserts—“the unlettered and the uncultured,” as Plato soeloquently put it in his Timaeus—who had been “spared the scourge of thedeluge.”96 [part0116.html#chapter9-96] But the civilizers entertained thedesperate hope, if their mission would succeed, that mankind might not have to“begin again like children, in complete ignorance of what happened in earlytimes.”97 [part0116.html#chapter9-97]The evidence of the Mesopotamian inscriptions, and of Göbekli Tepe to which wewill return, is that the mountain lands of ancient Armenia and eastern Turkeywere among the primal wildernesses to which the civilizers made their way afterthe flood. But the testimony of Edfu is that they also came to the Nile flowingin its fertile valley through the deserts of Egypt.Moreover the Building Texts say very clearly which part of Egypt they came tofirst—and it was not Edfu, as we’ll see in the next chapter."},{"pageContent":" Chapter 10 [part0131.html#c_ch10]Monastery of the Seven Sages [part0131.html#c_ch10]In his Timaeus, we’ve seen how Plato speaks of events, described in AncientEgyptian temple records, that took place 9,000 years before the time of Solon,i.e. in 9600 BC. Nor is the Timaeus the only place where Plato alludes to suchvast antiquity. In his Laws, for example, he says of the Ancient Egyptians:If you examine their art on the spot, you will find that ten thousand years ago(and I’m not speaking loosely; I mean literally ten thousand), paintings andreliefs were produced that are no better and no worse than those of today.1[part0117.html#chapter10-1]It’s interesting how the Greek philosopher makes a point of this “ten thousandyears ago,” emphasizing that he’s not speaking loosely—that he really means it.But we live, supposedly, in a more scientific age with the benefit of objectivedating techniques, so what are we to make of such a chronology?Plato was born around 428 BC, so his reference to “ten thousand years” agotranslates to around 10,400 BC in our calendar, within a whisker of the date of10,450 BC that I proposed in Fingerprints of the Gods for the remote epoch, ZepTepi—“the First Time”—when the Ancient Egyptians believed that the gods walkedthe earth and the civilization of the Nile Valley had its true beginnings.2[part0117.html#chapter10-2]This date, based on findings that arose from research underlying The OrionMystery, my friend Robert Bauval’s ground-breaking 1994 study of theastronomical aspects of the world-famous pyramids of Giza in Egypt,3[part0117.html#chapter10-3] was developed further by the two of us in 1996 inour co-authored book Keeper of Genesis (titled The Message of the Sphinx in theUS).4 [part0117.html#chapter10-4] In brief, the date arises from theextraordinarily precise layout of the principal monuments of the Giza plateauand the relationship of these monuments to certain stars in the sky. For fulldetails I refer the reader to Fingerprints of the Gods and to Keeper of Genesis,where this issue is explored in depth, but the heart of the matter lies in thefact that the positions of the stars in the sky are not fixed and finite butchange very gradually over a great cycle—known to astronomers as theprecessional cycle—that unfolds in a period of 25,920 years.image [../images/00036.jpeg]Figure 33: The effect of precession is to change the Pole Star over very longperiods of time.The cycle is the result of a motion of the earth itself, a slow circular wobbleof the planet’s axis of rotation unfolding at the rate of one degree every 72years; since the earth is the viewing platform from which we observe the stars,these changes in orientation inevitably affect the positions and rising times ofall stars as viewed from earth. Our Pole Star, for example, around which theremainder of the heavens appear to revolve, is simply the star at which theearth’s extended axis, passing through the geographical north pole, points mostdirectly. Presently it is Polaris (Alpha Ursae Minoris, in the constellation ofthe Little Bear), but the effect of precession is to change the Pole Star oververy long periods of time. Thus around 3000 BC, just before the start of thePyramid Age in Egypt, the Pole Star was Thuban (Alpha Draconis) in theconstellation of Draco. At the time of the Greeks it was Beta Ursae Minoris. InAD 14,000 it will be Vega.5 [part0117.html#chapter10-5] Sometimes in this longcyclical journey the extended north pole of the earth will point at empty spaceand then there will be no useful “Pole Star.”The most dramatic, and indeed beautiful and aesthetically pleasing effects ofprecession, however, are those observed at the horizon on the March equinox,when night and day are of equal length and when the sun rises perfectly due eastagainst the background of the twelve constellations of the zodiac. The rate ofchange is the same as at the pole, i.e. just one degree every 72 years, so itcannot easily be observed—let alone measured—in a single human lifetime. But ifyours is a culture that keeps careful records over very long periods, it will benoted that the zodiacal constellation that “houses” the sun on that special day(marking the beginning of spring in the northern hemisphere) does, indeed, veryslowly shift along the horizon until eventually, the next constellation takesits place.Broadly speaking the sun spends 2,160 years “in” each house of the zodiac (30degrees x 72 years) and, since there are twelve zodiacal houses, the result isthat “the Great Year”—the full precessional cycle—unfolds in 12 x 2,160 years,i.e. 25,920 years, at which point the cycle is back at its starting point and anew Great Year begins. In the sun’s annual path through the zodiac, spendingapproximately one month in each sign as all of us who check our horoscopes areaware, Aquarius is followed by Pisces, which in turn is followed by Aries, whichis followed by Taurus, then Gemini, then Cancer, then Leo, etc, etc, etc. Butthe slow, majestic precessional course of the sun through the Great Year is abackward motion that unfolds in exactly the opposite direction—thus Leo → Cancer→ Gemini → Taurus → Aries → Pisces → Aquarius—with each “month” being 2,160years in length.So, to give some specific examples, it is not an accident that the earlyChristians used the fish as their symbol, since the constellation of Pisceshoused the sun on the spring equinox from the very beginning of the Christianera until today. Nor is the famous song wrong to state that “we live in thedawning of the Age of Aquarius,” for the early twenty-first century does indeedstand in the astrological no-man’s land near the end of the “Age of Pisces” andon the threshold of the “New Age” of Aquarius. Going back before the Age ofPisces we come to the age of Aries (2330 BC–170 BC) when, in Ancient Egypt, ramswere the dominant symbolic motif (for example, the ram-headed sphinxes at thetemple of Karnak in Luxor), and before that to the Age of Taurus (4490 BC–2330BC) when the cult of the Apis Bull was initiated as early as the First Dynasty,or perhaps before.Different astrologers and astronomers might choose to move the constellationboundaries a few degrees (and thus a century or two) in one direction oranother, but the general schema is well understood and the dates given abovestand as a good approximation to the facts. Moving back in time further, as itis easy to do with modern computer programs that simulate ancient skies, we comeeventually to the Age of Leo when the constellation of Leo, the lion, housed thesun on the spring equinox. This astrological age spans the period between 10,970BC and 8810 BC—although, again, depending on where one sets the constellationboundaries, the dates might be pushed back or forward by a couple of centuries.What is clear, however, even with a little boundary juggling, is that the Age ofLeo pretty much perfectly encloses the Younger Dryas (10,800 BC to 9600 BC),something that I was unaware of when I wrote Fingerprints of the Gods. And, ofcourse, it was also the Age of Leo that I signaled in Fingerprints as the mostlikely candidate for the remote epoch that the Ancient Egyptians called ZepTepi, the “First Time.”image [../images/00037.jpeg]Figure 34: The sun has been in Pisces (1) at the spring equinox for the past2,000 years, defining the astrological “Age of Pisces,” but will in due courseshift into Aquarius (2) as a result of precession and the “Age of Aquarius” willbegin. At the same time the constellations marking the autumnal equinox willshift from Virgo (4) into Leo (3).Again, I refer readers to Fingerprints and to Keeper of Genesis, and to my laterbook Heaven’s Mirror,6 [part0117.html#chapter10-6] for more detailed discussionsof the astronomical facts, and of the ideas behind them. The essence of theargument, however, is that there was an ancient globally-distributeddoctrine—“as above so below”—that set out quite deliberately to create monumentson the ground that copied the patterns of certain significant constellations inthe sky. Moreover, since the positions of all stars change slowly butcontinuously as a result of the precession, it is possible to use particularconfigurations of astronomically aligned monuments to deduce the dates that theyrepresent—i.e. the dates when the stars were last in the positions depicted bythe monuments on the ground.The Giza plateau contains the world’s most striking array of astronomicallyaligned monuments and, for purposes of clarity, let me emphasize that thesealignments have nothing to do with compass directions. The “north” indicated bya compass is magnetic north which can vary by 10 degrees or more from true northand wanders constantly because of magnetic changes in the earth’s core. Truenorth is the geographical north pole of the earth, in other words the pivot ofour planet’s axis of rotation; from it true south, east and west are derived. Itis therefore significant that the gaze of the Great Sphinx is perfectly targetedon true east, while the three great pyramids are aligned with uncanny precisionto true north and south—indeed, the error in the case of the Great Pyramid isjust 3/60ths of a single degree.What this tells us is that all these monuments were set out using astronomy, forit is not possible to achieve such precision by any other means. In other words,even if there were no additional astronomical characteristics present, we wouldhave to say, on grounds of accuracy of alignment alone, that astronomers hadbeen at work here. But in fact there are many other astronomicalcharacteristics—not only in the monuments themselves but also in AncientEgyptian scriptures such as the Pyramid Texts—and for these, since I wish toavoid unnecessary repetition, I again refer the reader to my earlier books.image [../images/00038.jpeg]Figure 35: The alignment of the Great Pyramid is only 3/60th of a single degreeoff true north.The heart of the matter, however, involves two constellations—the constellationof Leo, rising due east above the sun at dawn on the spring equinox in the epochof 10,500 BC, and the constellation of Orion, which the Ancient Egyptiansvisualized as the celestial figure of the god Osiris, the deceased god-king whoruled over the afterlife kingdom known as the Duat. As we saw in Chapter Nine,Osiris was also believed in some way to be the Ka—the “double,” or spiritualessence—of the Pyramids of Giza.image [../images/00039.jpeg]Figure 36: The gaze of the Great Sphinx is perfectly targeted on true east.I will not vex the reader with lengthy substantiations of the assertions thatfollow since they are fully backed up, referenced and documented in my earlierbooks, but an uncanny sky-ground “lock” occurs at Giza in the epoch of 10,500BC. I had opted for a date fifty years later—10,450 BC—in Fingerprints, but suchminor details are not really significant since the stellar changes are so slow,even within a single astrological age, that the same general configuration holdsgood for many centuries. Indeed, it is true to say that the Giza sky-ground lockstays in place throughout most, if not all, of the Younger Dryas from 10,800 BCdown to 9600 BC.Effectively, therefore, the epoch of the “First Time,” which I will continue,for ease of reference, to refer to as the epoch of 10,500 BC, is the epoch ofthe Younger Dryas. And while it was a time of freezing temperatures furthernorth—particularly in North America and northern Europe—indications are that theclimate in Egypt would have been much more comfortable and conducive and muchwetter and more fertile than it is today. This is not to say that Egypt wasentirely spared the cataclysms of the Younger Dryas—there were powerful anddestructive Nile floods as we shall see—but by comparison with many other partsof the world it would have stood out as an inviting refuge.image [../images/00040.jpeg]Figure 37: Looking east in the dawn, about an hour before sunrise on the morningof the spring equinox in the epoch of 10,500 BC, we see the constellation of Leolying with its belly on the horizon, directly in line with the gaze of theSphinx.As above, so below … To return to the matter of the sky-ground lock at Giza inthe epoch of 10,500 BC, let us consider first the lion-bodied (and very likelyonce lion-headed) monument, oriented perfectly due east, that we call the GreatSphinx. It looks not only at the rising sun on the spring equinox but also atthe constellation that houses the sun on the equinox. Today, therefore, thismonument gazes at the cusp between Pisces and Aquarius. At the time of thebuilding of the Temple of Karnak it gazed at the constellation of Aries, and inthe Old Kingdom, when the Sphinx was supposedly built, it gazed at theconstellation of Taurus, the Bull—clearly not a perfect sky-ground match.Indeed, only in one epoch in the last 25,920 years has the lion-bodied Sphinxlooked out at its own celestial counterpart, the constellation of Leo, in thepre-dawn on the spring equinox, and that was in the epoch of 10,500 BC.image [../images/00041.jpeg]Figure 38: On the spring equinox in the epoch of 10,500 BC, at the exact momentthat the sun bisected the horizon due east, the three belt stars of theconstellation of Orion lay due south on the meridian—in a pattern that veryprecisely matches the pattern of the three Great Pyramids on the ground.But there is more. In that same epoch, at the exact moment that the sun bisectedthe horizon due east, the three belt stars of the constellation of Orion lay duesouth on the meridian—and they did so in a pattern that very precisely matchesthe pattern of the three Great Pyramids on the ground, thus making sublime senseof the image of Osiris/Orion as the Ka, or “double,” of the Pyramids.After Robert Bauval presented the Orion correlation to a global readership inhis 1994 book The Orion Mystery, and after the further work I did on the subjectin Fingerprints of the Gods, and that Robert and I did together in Keeper ofGenesis, the hypothesis came in for a great deal of criticism from themainstream archaeoastronomer Ed Krupp of the Griffiths Observatory of LosAngeles.Krupp claimed that the correlation was “upside down,” an argument of somesophistry based on the apparent curvature of the sky which means that thehighest of the three stars of Orion’s belt (matched, in the Orion correlation,by the southernmost of the three pyramids), is effectively the northernmoststar. Refuting this, we were able to demonstrate that laying the pyramids out onthe ground in the way that would satisfy Krupp might be technically “correct” interms of modern astronomical conventions, but would not produce an immediatelyrecognizable and visually pleasing similitude between what is seen in the skyand what is seen on the ground. If, on the other hand, one steers clear oftwenty-first century astronomical conventions (in which north is “up”), andsimply models on the ground—rather as an artist or a sculptor would—what wouldhave been seen in the sky at dawn on the spring equinox in the epoch of 10,500BC, then the result is indeed a very good match, as Robert Bauval alwaysclaimed, between the three great pyramids and the three stars of Orion’s Belt(see Appendix, The Orion correlation is not upside down, for further details).Moreover, as noted above, the particularly striking feature of this match is itslock with the Sphinx/Leo. The point is worth re-emphasizing. Looking east in thepredawn, about an hour before sunrise on the morning of the spring equinox inthe epoch of 10,500 BC, we see the constellation of Leo lying with its belly onthe horizon, directly in line with the gaze of the Sphinx. There is anunmissable sky/ground correlation here—for the constellation of Leo, in profileas seen at this moment, does very closely resemble the profile of the leonineSphinx.The earth turns, the stars and the sun rise, light floods the sky, and in duecourse—after about an hour—the solar disc bisects the horizon precisely dueeast, again exactly in line with the gaze of the Sphinx. At the precise momentit does so, the three stars of Orion’s belt fall into place centered due southover the meridian. This is confirmed absolutely by modern astronomical softwareand it would have been known absolutely by anyone with sophisticated knowledgeof the motions of the heavens, should such a person have been present at Giza inthe epoch of 10,500 BC. Indeed, one can almost feel the ponderous gears of thesky at work, like a huge clock: the hour hand is the Sphinx/Leo correlation andthe minute hand is the pyramids/Orion’s belt correlation, and both work togetherto point unmistakably to the epoch of 10,500 BC. This is the epoch that I longago suggested was the mysterious Ancient Egyptian “First Time,” but that I nowunderstand was significant for the world-changing cataclysm of the Younger Dryasas well.Dating with starsThe use of combinations of stars in the sky and large-scale constructions on theground to point symbolically to significant moments in history was a practicewidely pursued in antiquity, as extensively documented in my 1998 book Heaven’sMirror.7 [part0117.html#chapter10-7] Indeed, examples of such sky-groundmirroring, once they are properly understood, frequently shed new light onarchaeological inquiries. For example, in 2014 an ancient mound in the Republicof Macedonia was identified as man-made by archaeoacoustic analysis. The mound’sdimensions are 85 meters x 45 meters, it is very precisely oriented north–southand at its summit, placed within an oval ditch, a giant earthwork has beenidentified by researchers from the University of Trieste as a representation ofthe constellation of Cassiopeia, as it would have appeared from the site at dawnon July 21, 356 BC, the birthday of the famed Macedonian ruler Alexander theGreat. “Cassiopeia, lies directly to the north,” the researchers conclude:and stands vertically above the geoglyph in the sky’s zenith, forming a perfectpicture of the sky on the earth.8 [part0117.html#chapter10-8]Nor are such sky-ground endeavors confined to the ancient world. A relativelyrecent example is the Hoover Dam in the United States. There at the base of thetowering Monument of Dedication with its black diorite pedestals supporting twocolossal and imposing winged figures—themselves reminiscent of Mesopotamian andAncient Egyptian deities—the sculptor Oscar Hansen created a spectacularterrazzo floor with an inbuilt star chart. Here’s how the US Department of theInterior’s Bureau of Reclamation describes the artwork, and its purpose:The chart preserves for future generations the date on which President FranklinD. Roosevelt dedicated Hoover Dam, September 30, 1935 …In this celestial map, the bodies of the solar system are placed so exactly thatthose versed in astronomy could calculate the precession (progressively earlieroccurrence) of the Pole Star for approximately the next 14,000 years.Conversely, future generations could look upon this monument and determine, ifno other means were available, the exact date on which Hoover Dam wasdedicated.9 [part0117.html#chapter10-9]Hansen, who explicitly compared the dam to the Great Pyramid as “a monument tocollective genius exerting itself in community efforts around a common need orideal,”10 [part0117.html#chapter10-10] also incorporated the signs of the zodiacinto his design.11 [part0117.html#chapter10-11] Such elements, he said, were allput there as clues and pointers, so that “in remote ages to come, intelligentpeople” would be able to discern “the astronomical time of the dam’sdedication.”12 [part0117.html#chapter10-12]It so happens that the Hoover Dam and its monumental sculptures were completedin the same year, 1935, but it is, of course, possible to use symbolicarchitecture and astronomical alignments to make a permanent statement aboutsignificant moments in the past at any time. A parallel might be the greatGothic cathedrals of Europe built in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries of ourera but referring in every symbolic detail and in the sacred astronomy builtinto their stones and stained glass,13 [part0117.html#chapter10-13] to muchearlier periods—notably to the time of Christ and the time of the Old Testamentpatriarchs.From a purely astronomical point of view, what can be said about the huge effortand endeavor of the Giza monuments is that the ground-plan of the pyramids andthe Sphinx does speak clearly of the epoch of 10,500 BC. But as readers of myprevious books will be aware, the monuments also include features, such as thefour narrow shafts angled up through the body of the Great Pyramid, that targetsignificant stars in the epoch of 2500 BC when Egyptologists believe thepyramids were built.14 [part0117.html#chapter10-14]In other words both epochs are symbolized—2500 BC by the shafts and 10,500 BC bythe ground plan.Long-lived cult of the SagesThe hypothesis I derive from this is that Giza was one of several sites aroundthe world—Göbekli Tepe was another—where survivors of a great prehistoriccivilization that had been all but destroyed in the global cataclysm at theonset of the Younger Dryas chose to settle, and where their sages set in motiona long-term plan to bring about “the resurrection of the former world of thegods … The re-creation of the destroyed world.”15 [part0117.html#chapter10-15]Perhaps they felt that their own civilization had made some terrible error, someghastly mistake, that had brought down the punishment of the universe upon themin the form of the Younger Dryas comet, and that it would therefore be impiousor unwise to seek to refashion the destroyed world all at once and straightaway. Indeed, perhaps it proved impossible for them to do so. Though its climatewould have been attractive, at a time when much of the world was in the midst ofa sudden deep freeze, the Nile Valley, like so many other places, did suffercataclysmic events both at the beginning and at the end of the Younger Dryas.These events included episodes of extreme river floods, the so-called “WildNile,” that recurred several times in the epoch of 10,500 BC, with calmer andmore predictable conditions not being restored until about 9000 BC.16[part0117.html#chapter10-16]Located on higher ground, well above the valley floor, there is no evidence tosuggest that Giza itself was ever scoured by those floods and it would,therefore, have been an obvious choice in Egypt for the survivors to haveestablished a base and begun work on an architectural project, perhaps focusedaround certain natural features of the plateau itself. Among these I would drawparticular attention to the rocky hill more than thirty feet high—an excellentcontender for the “Great Primeval Mound” described in the Edfu texts, as weshall see—that would much later be incorporated into the core of the GreatPyramid.I suggest that a shaft was cut down into this hill and deep into the bedrockbeneath it to create the rectangular cavity that is now nominated as theSubterranean Chamber—which can still only be accessed today through that same300-foot-long shaft (now known as “the Descending Corridor”) that dives deeplyinto the bowels of the earth at an angle of 26 degrees. In my view, it isprobably only one of several underground features that were created at thattime, with others—far more extensive—still awaiting discovery.Likewise these visitors to primeval Giza of the epoch of 10,500 BC would alsohave found a crest or ridge of rock (the technical term for such a feature is a“yardang”), protruding downslope that had perhaps already been sculpted by theprevailing winds into something resembling the head of a lion. It faced east andoverlooked the Nile Valley and it would, in due course, be extensively excavatedand carved to form the Great Sphinx. It is likely that some substantial work wasdone in the epoch of 10,500 BC to free at least the front quarters of the corebody of the Sphinx from its surrounding bedrock. But my view, unchanged since Iwrote Fingerprints of the Gods, is that the majority of the work on thisproject, as on the pyramids themselves, was done later and finally completed inthe epoch of 2500 BC when the original leonine head of the Sphinx, perhapsheavily eroded, was recarved into the disproportionately small human head thatit still has today. My hypothesis, then and now, is that the same sacred “cult,”housed in something perhaps like a monastery, with a very small, evennegligible, archaeological footprint—let us call it the Monastery of the SevenSages—was involved in both major phases of the work and in everything thathappened at Giza in between. As I wrote in 1995, this hypothesis resolves theanomaly of the “missing” 8,000 years between the two epochs:by supposing the star shafts [of the Great Pyramid] to be merely the later workof the same long-lived cult that originally laid out the Giza ground plan in10,450 BC. Naturally the hypothesis also suggests that it was this same cult,toward the end of those 8,000 missing years, that provided the initiating sparkfor the sudden and “fully formed” emergence of the literate and accomplishedhistorical civilization of dynastic Egypt.17 [part0117.html#chapter10-17]Dating with lightSince the publication of Fingerprints of the Gods I have had many years toreflect on the mysteries of Giza. It remains my view that the role of thehistorical pharaohs of the Fourth Dynasty was to complete, and finally fulfill,a much more ancient plan first brought to Egypt in the epoch of 10,500 BC. Asnoted above, however, the subterranean elements of the Giza plateau, and theearliest work on the Sphinx, may actually date back to the epoch of 10,500 BC.By virtue of the distinctive weathering patterns on that monument’s flanks andon sections of the trench that surrounds it—highlighted in the analysis ofgeology professor Robert Schoch of Boston University—a proto-Sphinx does appearto have existed when heavy rains fell across Egypt at the end of the Ice Age,18[part0117.html#chapter10-18] perhaps even as early as the Wild Nile period.I have long been convinced by the geological evidence that the Sphinx does infact date back in some form to the epoch of 10,500 BC. But there is a gray areato do with events between 10,500 BC and 2500 BC and this concerns the megalithictemples of the plateau, particularly the Sphinx Temple (directly in front, i.e.to the east, of the Sphinx itself) and the Valley Temple which lies immediatelysoutheast of the Sphinx, both of which are built for the most part of limestoneblocks excavated from around the core body of the Sphinx, although in many casesthe limestone blocks are surfaced with a veneer of granite. The orthodoxarchaeological dating of these structures (both of their limestone and of theirgranite elements) is to the Old Kingdom—specifically to the Fourth Dynasty,approximately 2613 BC to 2494 BC19 [part0117.html#chapter10-19]—i.e. to theepoch of 2500 BC.When I wrote Fingerprints of the Gods, however, I was open to the possibilitythat they might date back to the epoch of 10,500 BC. I remain so, but in thelight of recent evidence some careful consideration is required. This is thecase because an advanced scientific technique known as surface luminescencedating (which measures light energy stored in stone) has been applied to thesetemples. This technique seems, on the face of things, to rule out ratherconclusively any possibility that the temples were created in the form we seethem now in the epoch of 10,500 BC.20 [part0117.html#chapter10-20]I say “on the face of things” because there are certain problems with the newtechnique which mean that any conclusions drawn from it must be carefullythought through. Most significantly, as the researchers themselves admit,surface luminescence dating relies upon the assumption that the sample beingtested has not been exposed to sunlight since it was set into place in thebuilding of which it is a part. Should there have been exposure to sunlight,even if “just minutes” in duration—as would happen, for example, if any laterreworking of the sampled area had been undertaken without cover of a roof—then“the latent luminescence is released … setting the signal to zero or near zero,”and thus yielding a date that reflects the most recent reworking rather than theoriginal date at which the building was constructed.21[part0117.html#chapter10-21]The Giza Surface Luminescence Dating study was conducted by nuclear physicistProfessor Ioannis Liritzis and his colleague Asimina Vafiadou, both of theLaboratory of Archaeometry at the University of the Aegean. They reported theirresults in detail in 2015 in the Journal of Cultural Heritage.22[part0117.html#chapter10-22] Conclusive indications that at least some of thestructures they sampled had indeed been reworked, with their latent luminescencezeroed and the clock set ticking again at the time of the reworking, areprovided by Sample No. 4 (Valley Temple limestone) and Sample No. 6 (SphinxTemple granite). The former yielded a very young surface luminescence date of1050 BC, plus or minus 540 years, while the latter yielded a surfaceluminescence date of 1190 BC, plus or minus 340 years.23[part0117.html#chapter10-23] These are, effectively, dates from Ancient Egypt’sNew Kingdom (Eighteenth Dynasty and later) and we have firm archaeological andepigraphic evidence that both the Sphinx Temple and the Valley Temple werealready very ancient by New Kingdom times.Since this is so, the other dates yielded by the study must also be regardedwith caution and certainly cannot be taken as firm evidence of the date ofconstruction of the temples—particularly in the case of Sample No. 3 (ValleyTemple granite), and Samples No. 7 and 8 (both Sphinx Temple granite). Theseyielded surface luminescence dates, respectively, of 3060 BC, plus or minus 470years; 2740 BC, plus or minus 640 years; and 3100 BC, plus or minus 540 years.24[part0117.html#chapter10-24] These dates are broadly compatible with the OldKingdom—although with some reservations which we will explore below—but they donot under any circumstance rule out a much more ancient date of construction forthe limestone core masonry of the temples, since it has always been RobertSchoch’s contention that:this granite sheathing was added in the Old Kingdom to repair and restore theearlier (much earlier—“Sphinx Age”) limestone temples.25[part0117.html#chapter10-25]We are left, then, with only a single sample (Sample No. 5) which was taken fromthe original limestone core masonry of the Sphinx Temple. It yielded a surfaceluminescence date of 2220 BC, plus or minus 220 years,26[part0117.html#chapter10-26] but really nothing very conclusive can be saidabout it or deduced from it since its location does not rule out thepossibility, as Schoch observed when I asked him to comment on these findings,that it “may also have been exposed or reworked during repairs to the structureduring the Old Kingdom.”27 [part0117.html#chapter10-27]In summary, the new study does not provide any evidence to confirm beyond doubtthat the original limestone megalithic elements of the Sphinx and Valley Templeswere built by the Fourth Dynasty Pharaoh Khafre, as archaeologists maintain. Onthe contrary, the only thing the study seems to demonstrate for sure is thatthese temples were reworked during the New Kingdom. More alarming for themainstream chronology, the surface luminescence dating raises the possibilitythat the granite sheathing on the temples (with the exception of Sample No. 6with its New Kingdom date) was not added in the Fourth Dynasty at all but manycenturies earlier—indeed as early as 3380 BC at the extreme end of the datingrange for Sample No. 7, as early as 3530 BC for Sample No. 3, and as early as3640 BC for Sample No. 8.28 [part0117.html#chapter10-28]This potentially pushes what Robert Schoch has always regarded as restorationwork on the Sphinx Temple (the adding of a granite veneer on top of much olderand extensively eroded megalithic limestone blocks) far back into thepre-dynastic period, i.e. long before any large-scale construction is supposedto have been undertaken in Egypt. And needless to say if these temples were inneed of such radical restoration in the pre-dynastic period then their coremasonry is likely to be very ancient indeed, perhaps even going back as far asthe epoch of 10,500 BC.So much then for the Sphinx Temple and the Valley Temple, but what of theenigmatic pyramids that loom over them?The researchers were not able to study the second pyramid at Giza,conventionally attributed (like the Sphinx and its temples) to Khafre. Nor didthey investigate the Great Pyramid, attributed to Khufu. But they did test asingle sample from the smallest of the three pyramids, which Egyptologyattributes to Menkaure, the Pharaoh who succeeded Khafre to the throne. Takenfrom the granite facing stones of the pyramid, and not from its core masonry,this sample produced yet another strikingly anomalous date—3450 BC, plus orminus 950 years—when assayed for surface luminescence.29[part0117.html#chapter10-29] Only at the youngest end of the range (3450 minus950 = 2500 BC) does this date approximate to the reign of Menkaure—although manyauthorities do not see that pharaoh taking the throne until 2490 BC,30[part0117.html#chapter10-30] and thus after “his” pyramid was completed even atthe most recent date offered by the surface luminescence spectrum. But what ismore disturbing are the other possibilities raised by the dating, i.e. that thefacing stones of the so-called “Pyramid of Menkaure” could have been put inplace as early as 3450 BC or even, perhaps, 950 years before that, i.e. in 4400BC and thus deep in the pre-dynastic period almost two thousand years prior tothe Old Kingdom.More work needs to be done to settle all this. As I’ve said, I remain willing,for the moment, to accept the still prevailing mainstream view that dates thepyramids to the Old Kingdom. But what is in the process of emerging, I think, isrecognition of the need for a more nuanced view of the whole site with strongindications from geology, from astronomy, and now from surface luminescencedating as well, that it can no longer be attributed exclusively to the epoch of2500 BC, but rather appears to be the result of a series of developments over animmensely long time-frame going back more than 12,000 years. As ProfessorIoannis Liritzis of the University of the Aegean, lead author of the surfaceluminescence study, concludes, parts of the site appear to have been reused and:it is a reasonable assumption that some of the structures were already presentat Giza when the large-scale works of the Fourth Dynasty began.31[part0117.html#chapter10-31]Nor is the question of the age of the site the only open one. Its function, too,is up for grabs. Egyptologists like to define the pyramids as “tombs and tombsonly,” but as Professor Liritzis notes:The lack of contemporary human funerary remains from any Egyptian pyramid, andthe obvious astronomical and geometric nature of the site, that prove theirorientation was not by chance but inhere knowledge and star configurationpatterns at the period of construction, imply that the “pyramids as tombs”theory is no longer sufficient and a broader determination of age, function andre-use of both pyramids and Giza is required …32 [part0117.html#chapter10-32]“This book which descended from the sky…”We’ve seen that there are many passages in the Edfu Building Texts which tell usthat those among the “gods” of the Early Primeval Age who survived the floodthat destroyed their former Homeland set about “wandering” the world with thepurpose of establishing new sacred domains in suitable locations. One passagenames a specific location that some of these “gods” found their way to, thefirst place they settled in Egypt. This turns out not to have been Edfu in Upper(southern) Egypt but rather the city that the Greeks later came to know asHeracleopolis,33 [part0117.html#chapter10-33] which is located in Lower(northern) Egypt and which the Egyptians themselves named Henen-nesut, meaning“the house of the royal child.” Archaeologists do not know when Henen-nesut wasestablished, but a reference to it on the Palermo Stone (so-called because it isnow kept in the Archaeological Museum of the city of Palermo in Italy) shedssome light on the matter. An ancient fragment of inscribed diorite, the PalermoStone provides information (dismissed as “mythological” by Egyptologists) ofsome 120 pre-dynastic kings said to have ruled in Egypt prior to 3000 BC. But italso gives details of the early Dynastic period which Egyptologists accept as“historical.” An entry on the Stone dating to the reign of Den, the second Kingof the First Dynasty, suggests strongly that the origins ofHeracleopolis/Henen-nesut go very far back into the pre-dynastic period.34[part0117.html#chapter10-34]But Henen-nesut is just where the trail begins, because it turns out it wasclosely associated with the ancient religious center of Memphis, Inbu-Hedj(later Mn-nfr), which stands about 60 miles (100 kilometers) further north andwas, according to legend, established by Menes, the first king of the FirstDynasty—although again its origins are likely to be far earlier. It is thereforeof interest, as Eve Reymond, the translator of the Edfu Building Texts,observes, that:It is impossible to read the principal Edfu records and not be struck by thevery pronounced Memphite background and tone that is still preserved in them.35[part0117.html#chapter10-35]In her view the Edfu texts “preserve the memory of a pre-dynastic religiouscenter which once existed near Memphis”—a center which “the Egyptians looked onas the homeland of the Egyptian temple.”36 [part0117.html#chapter10-36] Note,she is not saying “which once existed in Henen-nesut,” nor even “in Memphis”itself, but rather “near Memphis.” In short, the location is a bit of a mystery;Reymond supposes that archaeology has not yet identified it.37[part0117.html#chapter10-37] But wherever it was, it was believed to be a placecarefully selected by the gods for the foundation of the first of the newgeneration of temples dedicated to the god Horus—the essential opening gambit inthe long-term project to recreate the destroyed former world.38[part0117.html#chapter10-38] A text on the inner face of the enclosure wall atEdfu was recognized as an important clue by Reymond in her own search for themystery location, since it tells us that the primordial Temple of Horus was:built at the dictates of the ancestors according to what was written in thisbook which descended from the sky to the north of Memphis.39[part0117.html#chapter10-39]An extensive burial ground for the ancient kings of Memphis, known toEgyptologists as the “Memphite Necropolis,” rose to particular prominence duringthe Fourth Dynasty, 2613 BC to 2492 BC, when, according to orthodox chronology,both the Great Pyramid and the Great Sphinx are supposed to have been built. Thepyramid fields of Dhashur, Saqqara and Giza were all integral parts of theNecropolis—so in theory all might be candidates.40 [part0117.html#chapter10-40]But at Giza, as we’ve seen, the Sphinx models the constellation of Leo in 10,500BC, the three pyramids model the Belt of Orion in the same epoch, and the fourshafts of the Great Pyramid lock on to specific stars in the later epoch of 2500BC. Far more obviously than Dhashur and Saqqara, therefore, it seems to me thatGiza absolutely merits description as “book which descended from the sky”—a bookwritten with the “pen” of megalithic architecture in the “script” of precession.There is something else. The god Horus, for whom the primordial temple wasbuilt, is a complex figure who manifests in many different symbolic forms,notably the falcon; indeed, an imposing granite statue of Horus the Falconstands in the forecourt at the Temple of Edfu to this day. Horus was likewisefrequently depicted as a man with the head of a falcon—a classic therianthropein other words, like the Apkallu sages of Mesopotamia. But Horus had anotherprominent avatar and that was as a lion.41 [part0117.html#chapter10-41] Moreoverthis Horus lion was sometimes depicted as a therianthrope with a human head andthere is a specific inscription in the Edfu Temple which tells us that:Horus of Edfu transformed himself into a lion which had the face of a man …42[part0117.html#chapter10-42]Mystery of the SphinxGiven the connection that the Edfu texts draw with the Giza area, and with thatmysterious “book descended from the sky,” it is therefore impossible to ignorethe fact that the Ancient Egyptians closely identified Horus with the GreatSphinx of Giza. In this capacity the lion-bodied (and probably once lion-headed)Sphinx was known both as Hor-em-Akhet—“Horus in the Horizon”—and also asHorakhti which, with a subtle difference of emphasis, means “Horus of theHorizon.”43 [part0117.html#chapter10-43]However, there is a very odd thing about the Sphinx. With the exception of Dr.Rainer Stadelmann, who believes that it was the work of the Fourth DynastyPharaoh Khufu, all other modern Egyptologists are united in the opinion that theSphinx was made by Khufu’s son Khafre.44 [part0117.html#chapter10-44] I use theword “opinion” deliberately, because it is important to be clear at the outsetthat we are not dealing here with an established empirical “fact” about theSphinx, but rather with a received body of Egyptological conjecture which hasgradually, through lack of opposition, begun to be treated as though it were aproven fact. “As very often in our discipline, old and seemingly certainstatements rest forever without further verification,” comments Dr.Stadelmann,45 [part0117.html#chapter10-45] who should know what he’s talkingabout since he was Director of the German Archaeological Institute in Cairo from1989 to 1998.When we confine ourselves to the facts about the Sphinx rather than the opinionsof Egyptologists, the first thing we discover is that no inscriptions havesurvived from the Old Kingdom which refer to this stupendous and imposingmonument. Even the great Egyptologist Selim Hassan, who conducted extensiveexcavations at Giza in the 1930s, was therefore obliged to admit:As to the exact age of the Sphinx, and to whom we should attribute its erection,no definite facts are known, and we have not one single contemporary inscriptionto enlighten us on this point.46 [part0117.html#chapter10-46]Neither, for that matter, are there any inscriptions from the First IntermediatePeriod, or from the Middle Kingdom, or from the Second Intermediate Period.Indeed, it is not until we come to the New Kingdom, roughly 1550 BC onward,supposedly about a thousand years after it was carved out of the bedrock of theGiza plateau, that the pharaohs of Ancient Egypt suddenly start talking aboutthe Sphinx.What Selim Hassan rightly describes as “the earliest authentic opinion” is givenby Amenhotep II (1427-1401 BC) who built a small temple that can still be seentoday on the north side of the Sphinx enclosure.47 [part0117.html#chapter10-47]There on a limestone stela, this New Kingdom pharaoh refers to the Sphinx underthe names Hor-em-Akhet and Horakhti,48 [part0117.html#chapter10-48] and alsomakes a direct reference to the Giza pyramids which—to the annoyance ofEgyptologists—he does not ascribe to his Fourth Dynasty predecessors Khufu,Khafre and Menkaure, but rather nominates as “the Pyramids of Hor-em-akhet.”49[part0117.html#chapter10-49] The clear implication is that in Amenhotep’stime—far closer to the Fourth Dynasty than our own—there existed no historicalarchives, nor even any tradition, that linked the pyramids with the threepharaohs whom modern Egyptologists now insist were their builders. On thecontrary, as Selim Hassan explains, the use of the epithet “Pyramids ofHor-em-Akhet” suggests (since Hor-em-Akhet was one of the names by which theSphinx was known) that Amenhotep:considered the Sphinx to be older than the Pyramids.50[part0117.html#chapter10-50]Chronologically, the next inscription referring to the Sphinx occurs on thefamous “Dream Stela” of Thutmosis IV. The story goes that before he ascended tothe throne the future pharaoh was out hunting one day around Giza where theSphinx lay forgotten, buried up to its neck in sand. Thutmosis took a siesta inthe shade of the giant head at which point:A vision of sleep seized him at the hour when the sun was in the zenith, and hefound the majesty of this revered god speaking with his own mouth, as a fatherspeaks with his son, saying: “Behold thou me! See thou me my son Thutmosis! Iam … Hor-em-Akhet … who will give thee my kingdom on earth” …51[part0117.html#chapter10-51]However, there was a condition for, the Sphinx said, “the sand of this desertupon which I am has reached me … My manner is as if I were ailing in my limbs …Thou shalt be to me a protector…”52 [part0117.html#chapter10-52]To cut a long story short, Thutmosis understood that if he were to clear theSphinx of sand and restore it to its former glory he would become pharaoh.Accordingly he did as he was instructed and, when the restoration was complete,and the throne was his as prophesied, he erected the Dream Stela incommemoration.If you visit the site today you can still see the huge stela—it’s nearly 12 feethigh and more than 7 feet wide—standing between the paws of the Sphinx directlyin front of the monument’s chest, but much of the original inscription, from thethirteenth line onward, has flaked away. In the 1830s, however, a cast was takenof it, at which time some—though unfortunately not all—of the thirteenth linewas still intact. There the single syllable Khaf (no longer present today) wasnoted and from this, as the American Egyptologist James Henry Breasted commentsin his authoritative translation of the stela, many have been inclined toconclude that the Sphinx was the work of Khafre. Such a conclusion, Breastedadds dryly, “does not follow.” He points out that there is in fact “no trace ofa cartouche” (the oval sign that normally enclosed royal names) on the copiesand casts of the stela that were made in the nineteenth century—which suggestsstrongly that the syllable Khaf did not refer at all to the Fourth DynastyPharaoh Khafre.53 [part0117.html#chapter10-53]Moreover, as Selim Hassan later added, even if the cartouche had been there, weare not at liberty to conclude from the damaged line that Khafre made theSphinx. At the most it would tell us that “Thutmosis in some way connected theSphinx with Khafre.”54 [part0117.html#chapter10-54] Even Gaston Maspero, who wasthe Director of the Department of Antiquities at the Cairo Museum in the latenineteenth century, and who did believe the cartouche had once been present, sawno reason to deduce from such flimsy evidence that the Sphinx was Khafre’s work.On the contrary, his preferred interpretation was that the purpose of Thutmosisin this part of the inscription was to recognize a former renovation andclearance of the Sphinx undertaken by Khafre. “Consequently,” Maspero wrote, “wehave here almost certain proof that the Sphinx was already buried in sand in thetime of Khufu [Khafre’s father] and his predecessors.” 55[part0117.html#chapter10-55]Maspero would later change his view, grudgingly stating that the Sphinx“probably represents Khafre himself”56 [part0117.html#chapter10-56]and thusfalling in line with the growing consensus among Egyptologists of the twentiethcentury. His initial opinion that the monument was older than Khafre, and indeedhad been buried in sand in the time of Khufu, had in part been based oninformation contained in yet another stela, the so-called Inventory Stela,discovered at Giza in the 1850s by the French archaeologist, Auguste Mariette.The gist of the Inventory Stela, once also referred to as the Stela of Khufu’sDaughter,57 [part0117.html#chapter10-57] was that the Great Sphinx and theValley Temple, as well as a number of other structures on the plateau, werealready in existence long before Khufu came to the throne.58[part0117.html#chapter10-58]What apparently “debunked” it, however, and no doubt contributed to Maspero’schange of mind, was firm evidence that the hieroglyphic writing system used inthe inscription was not consistent with the style of the Fourth Dynasty, butbelonged to a much more recent period—Selim Hassan suggests the Twenty-sixthDynasty.59 [part0117.html#chapter10-59] This interesting little stela hastherefore subsequently come to be regarded as a work of fiction, most likelyfabricated by a group of priests who wished to magnify the name of the goddessIsis (who was popular in the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, 664-525 BC) and thus of novalue in our attempts to determine what happened at Giza nearly 2000 yearsearlier in the Fourth Dynasty—or perhaps long before.That is certainly how things look when viewed through the prism of“Egyptologic”—i.e. that special form of reasoning, with a built-in doublestandard, deployed only by Egyptologists. According to Egyptologic, if evidencesupports established theories then that evidence will be accepted. But ifevidence undermines established theories, then that evidence must be rejected.Thus Egyptology uses entirely circumstantial and non-contemporary data tosupport its present claim that the Sphinx and its megalithic temples were thework of the Pharaoh Khafre of the Fourth Dynasty (as we’ve seen, Selim Hassanadmits that “we have not one single contemporary inscription” to enlighten us asto the exact age of the Sphinx). So the dating of the monument to the FourthDynasty—something that Egyptologists tout as a “fact,” that is taught as such inuniversities and that is widely disseminated by the media—rests entirely on its“context” (the nearby pyramids and megalithic temples) and on that singlesyllable Khaf, which was once present on the Eighteenth Dynasty Dream Stela.The flimsy case of EgyptologyAs to context, even if the pyramids were exclusively the work of the FourthDynasty—which is called into question, as we’ve seen, by the surfaceluminescence dating of the pyramid attributed to Menkaure—we could still notsafely deduce that the Sphinx is also Fourth Dynasty work. Indeed, it could bethe case that the pyramids were built where they are precisely because theSphinx was already there, bestowing an air of ancient sanctity on the site.Neither do the megalithic temples really prove anything about the Sphinx sincethere is no evidence that unequivocally dates their own construction to theFourth Dynasty. The most that can be said is that a black diorite statue ofKhafre (now in the Cairo Museum) was found dumped upside down in a deep pit inthe Valley Temple. However, this tells us only that Khafre at some pointrequired his statue to be placed in the temple and that he therefore identifiedwith the temple in some way, not that he built it.Superficially more persuasive is the claim made by some Egyptologists thatKhafre’s name was found inscribed at the Valley Temple. On his “Guardians”website, National Geographic Explorer in Residence Dr. Zahi Hawass, the formerDirector of the Giza Plateau and Secretary General of Egypt’s Supreme Council ofAntiquities, has this to say about the Valley Temple:inscriptions in the building are around the entrance doorways; they list theKing’s names and titles, those of the goddess Bastet (north doorway) and thoseof Hathor (south doorway).60 [part0117.html#chapter10-60]Wikipedia, which is influential in shaping public perceptions of Giza, and whichroutinely labels non-mainstream approaches as “pseudoscience,” goes even furtherthan Hawass when it says of the Valley Temple that:Blocks have been found showing the partial remains of an inscription with theHorus name of Khafre (Weser-ib).61 [part0117.html#chapter10-61]On closer examination, however, Wikipedia turns out to be misinformed. StephenQuirke, Professor of Egyptian Archaeology at University College London, was kindenough to look into this for me when I raised it with him and in due coursereported the results of his investigation. The partial inscription with theHorus name of Khafre does not in fact appear on blocks from the Valley Temple,but rather on blocks from an entirely different building at Giza.62[part0117.html#chapter10-62]What, then, of Dr. Hawass’s statement about “the King’s names and titles.” It isclear, at any rate, what his source is because in the first (1947) edition ofhis classic study The Pyramids of Egypt, I.E.S. Edwards, formerly Keeper ofEgyptian Antiquities at the British Museum, wrote several pages about the ValleyTemple which, along with the rest of the Egyptological profession by this time,he identified as being the work of Khafre.63 [part0117.html#chapter10-63]“Around each doorway,” he stated:is a band of hieroglyphic inscription giving the name and titles of the King; noother inscriptions or reliefs occur anywhere else in the building.64[part0117.html#chapter10-64]That would seem to settle the matter were it not for the fact that many yearslater, when Edwards produced the definitive final edition of his book, herevised the above passage with important information that he did not present in1947. “Around each doorway,” we now read:was carved a band of hieroglyphic inscriptions giving the name and titles of theKing, but only the last words “Beloved [of the goddess] Bastet” and “Beloved [ofthe goddess] Hathor” are preserved. No other inscriptions occur anywhere else inthe building.65 [part0117.html#chapter10-65]Needless to say the words “Beloved of Bastet” and “Beloved of Hathor” do not, inisolation like this, prove that Khafre was the King referred to as being the“beloved” of these deities. They could apply to anybody and therefore cannotlegitimately be used to support the claim that the Valley Temple was the work ofKhafre.Is there anything else to support that claim? The obscure and eye-wateringlyexpensive Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt contains an entry onthe “Khafre pyramid complex.” Written again by Zahi Hawass, the entry informs usthat the Valley Temple:is identified with Khafre from inscriptions on granite casing blocks from thewestern end of the Valley Temple. Reliefs from this complex were discovered atel-Lisht, where they were used as fill for the pyramid of Amenemhat I (TwelfthDynasty).66 [part0117.html#chapter10-66]Now this is really clutching at straws! Since they are miles away at el-Lisht,cannibalized as filler material for a later monarch’s pyramid, the reality isthat these blocks tell us nothing reliable at all about the Valley Temple.Perhaps they were taken from there, but then again, perhaps they came fromsomewhere else entirely.Besides, nobody is claiming that any of the inscriptions were made on thelimestone core masonry of the Valley Temple. All of them appear on “granitecasing blocks” and as we’ve seen, the granite casing blocks of the Valley Templegive every appearance of being a veneer that was applied long after the corelimestone blocks were set in place—in some cases perhaps as early as 3640 BC andin others perhaps as late as 1190 BC. That Khafre may well have been one ofseveral pharaohs who carried out restoration work on the Valley Temple duringthis long period, and that he commemorated his good deeds with an officialinscription and some statues of himself—perhaps at the same time as he alsoappears to have carried out a restoration project on the Sphinx—does not meanthat he was the original builder either of the Sphinx or the Temple.So we are left, then, with that single syllable Khaf on the Eighteenth DynastyDream Stela, which modern Egyptologists (unlike their nineteenth-centurypredecessors) have eagerly grasped as “proof” that Khafre built the Sphinx.Needless to say the Eighteenth Dynasty and the Fourth Dynasty are notcontemporary with one another. Moreover, there is a strong case to be made thateven the Eighteenth Dynasty attribution of the stela is questionable. Breasted,for example, points to “errors and striking irregularities in orthography” andto a number of other “suspicious peculiarities” leading him to conclude that theinscription was not in fact the work of Thutmosis IV but was a “laterestoration” dating to between the Twenty-first Dynasty and the Twenty-sixth(Saitic) Dynasty.67 [part0117.html#chapter10-67]In other words, it is quite possible that the Dream Stela is as young as theInventory Stela. Yet “Egyptologic” requires the shaky evidence of the Khafsyllable on the former to be accepted as proof that Khafre made the Sphinx,whereas the several clear statements on the latter that absolutely contradictthe attribution to Khafre are rejected as “preposterous fictions.”Dynamite revelationsHere are some extracts from the text of the Inventory Stela. Note before readingthat all the pharaohs of Egypt were regarded as incarnations of the god Horus68[part0117.html#chapter10-68] and the name Horus was therefore routinely includedin their titles. Each King also had a “Horus name,” which in Khufu’s case wasMezer:69 [part0117.html#chapter10-69]Live Horus, the Mezer, the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Khufu, given life. Hefound the House of Isis, Mistress of the Pyramid, by the side of cavity of theSphinx, on the northwest of the House of Osiris, Lord of Rostau … The plans ofthe Image of Hor-em-akhet were brought in order to bring to revision the sayingsof the disposition of the Image … He restored the statue all covered inpainting … He made to quarry the hind part of the nemes headdress, which waslacking, from gilded stone, and which had a length of about 7 ells (3.7 metersor 12 feet). He came to make a tour, in order to see the thunderbolt, whichstands in the Place of the Sycamore, so named because of a great sycamore, whosebranches were struck when the Lord of Heaven descended upon the place ofHor-em-akhet … The figure of this God, being cut in stone, is solid, and willexist to eternity, having always its face regarding the East.70[part0117.html#chapter10-70]The language of the Inventory Stela is obscure, but Selim Hassan’s analysisbrings some clarity. “If we could believe its inscriptions,” he writes:we should have to credit Khufu with having repaired the Sphinx, apparently afterit had been damaged by a thunderbolt. As a matter of fact, there may be a grainof truth in this story, for the tail of the nemes headdress of the Sphinx iscertainly missing, and it is not a part, which, by reason of its shape andposition, could be easily broken off, except by a direct blow from some heavyobject, delivered with terrific force. There is actually to be seen on the backof the Sphinx the scar of this breakage, and traces of the old mortar with whichit was repaired. This scar measures about 4 meters which accords with themeasurements recorded on the stela … Therefore, it is perhaps likely that theSphinx was struck by lightning, but there is not a particle of evidence to showthat this accident happened in the reign of Khufu.71[part0117.html#chapter10-71]Neither, however, is there any evidence to prove that the “accident” to theSphinx did not happen in the reign of Khufu. All we have is the Egyptologicalbias that it could not have happened then, because the Sphinx is supposed to bethe work of Khafre, undertaken after Khufu’s death, andtherefore—obviously—should not have existed in Khufu’s time.image [../images/00042.jpeg]Figure 39: The Inventory Stela. The gist of the inscriptions, whichEgyptologists reject, is that the Great Sphinx and the Valley Temple, as well asa number of other structures on the Giza plateau, were already in existence longbefore Khufu came to the throne.The same goes for the second dynamite revelation of the Inventory Stela, namelythe mention of “the House of Osiris, Lord of Rostau.”72[part0117.html#chapter10-72] We can gather the location of this structurebecause “the cavity of the Sphinx” is said to lie on its “northwest”73[part0117.html#chapter10-73]—which means, to put things the other way round,that “the House of Osiris, Lord of Rostau” is located immediately southeast ofthe Sphinx. The only structure which fits these coordinates is the Valley Templewhich does indeed lie immediately southeast of the Sphinx. As with thereferences to the Sphinx itself, therefore, the testimony of the Inventory Stelais that the Valley Temple was not made by Khafre since it was already inexistence in the time of his predecessor Khufu.These, then, are the real reasons why the Inventory Stela has been rejected byEgyptologists as a preposterous fiction—rather, say, than as an inscription thatpreserves and transmits to a later age, using language and terminology suitableto that age, a much older but genuine tradition. Certainly the rejection cannotbe because the Inventory Stela is not contemporary with the reign of Khufu, orbecause of its Twenty-sixth Dynasty “orthography”—since such factors do notprevent Egyptologists from accepting the Dream Stela, which suffers from thesame non-contemporaneity and the same “striking irregularities in orthography.”In short, is it not obvious that the Inventory Stela has been rejected andignored, while the Dream Stela has been accepted and embraced, because theformer blows the established theory of Egyptian history completely out of thewater, while the latter can be conveniently “spun” to support the establishedtheory?A bolt from heaven and an ancient archiveQuite apart from its implications of a much older Sphinx, there are two otheraspects of the Inventory Stela that merit further investigation.The first is the information that the Sphinx had been damaged by a“thunderbolt.” Selim Hassan is willing to accept there might be some truth tothat, but we cannot be sure that a thunderbolt means a lightning strike as heassumes. The thunderbolt in question is said in the inscription still to havebeen present for Khufu to “see” when he made his “tour.” This would not be thecase with lightning, which would leave damage but not a physical object thatcould be viewed. On the other hand a meteorite, after striking and damaging theSphinx, would have been there, on the spot, for inspection by the King—anddescending in fire from the sky amidst awesome noise, burning a great old treein its passage, a meteorite might easily be described as a thunderbolt (indeedin a number of cultures that was exactly how meteorites were described).74[part0117.html#chapter10-74]Equally intriguing is the Inventory Stela’s statement that “the plans of theImage of Hor-em-akhet”—i.e. of the Sphinx—were brought to the site by Khufu,presumably for reference purposes while the repair of the monument wasundertaken. This very obviously implies the existence of an ancient “archive”pertaining to Giza, perhaps a “Hall of Records” reminiscent of the lost recordsin the temple library at Edfu from which we know the Building Texts wereextracted.These, as we’ve seen, were said to be the words of the Seven Sages, taken downin writing by no lesser personage than the wisdom god Thoth himself. Reymondeven suggests that there may once have existed a Sacred Book of the EarlyPrimeval Age of the Gods, in which the whole “divine” plan in Egypt was setout.75 [part0117.html#chapter10-75] And the indications are, she says, that thiswas linked to a second ancient book, The Specifications of the Mounds of theEarly Primeval Age, which was believed to contain records not only of all thelesser “mounds” and the temples that would ultimately be built upon them as partof the project to bring about the rebirth of the destroyed world of the “gods,”but also of the Great Primeval Mound itself.76 [part0117.html#chapter10-76]Unfortunately nothing more is known about either of these lost “books” than thefew very brief and tantalizing references to them at Edfu. Nonetheless, as Isuggested earlier, there is every possibility that this Great Primeval Mound,where the time of the present age of the earth supposedly began, was the rockyhill at Giza around which the Great Pyramid would in due course be built. Thereis, too, an extraordinary text, preserved on papyrus from Egypt’s MiddleKingdom, which speaks of a search for “the secret chambers of the sanctuary ofThoth”—secret chambers that Khufu wished to “copy” for his temple.A deep and ancient mystery that we’ll explore in the next chapter lies concealedin these strange references."},{"pageContent":" Chapter 11 [part0131.html#c_ch11]The Books of Thoth [part0131.html#c_ch11]A quick summary.The Edfu Building Texts speak of the “Homeland of the Primeval Ones”—an island,the location of which is never specified—that was destroyed by an “enemy,”described as a “serpent,” “the Great Leaping One.” The “serpent’s” assaultcaused a flood that inundated this “primeval world of the gods,” killing themajority of its “divine” inhabitants. A few of them, however, escaped thedisaster and fled the scene in boats to wander the earth. Their purpose in sodoing was to identify suitable sites where they might set in motion a sacreddesign to bring aboutthe resurrection of the former world of the gods … The re-creation of adestroyed world.And all of these events took place in the “early primeval age”—a very, very longtime ago, so long ago that they would have passed beyond human remembering ifgreat efforts had not been made to preserve them. “In our temples,” the Egyptianpriests of Sais reportedly told Solon:we have preserved from earliest times a written record of any great or splendidachievement or notable event which has come to our ears.1[part0118.html#chapter11-1]This was the case, too, at Edfu where Reymond’s detailed study reveals that avast and extensive archive once existed, from which the extracts were taken thatthe priests carved into the temple walls and that thus still survive. It is byfollowing the trail of clues in these extracts, as we did in the last chapter,that we have arrived at the Great Sphinx, perhaps the very “lion which had theface of a man” that Horus was said in the Edfu texts to have transformed himselfinto.In this context, the reference in the Inventory Stela to Khufu having access toplans of the Sphinx, which he refers to when he “restores the statue,” issuggestive of the existence of an ancient archive of Giza—perhaps an archivedating back to the remote age when the site was founded by the “gods” withdistinctive astronomical characteristics that would later allow the wholecomplex to be described as a “book which descended from the sky.” Does this“book” refer to the constellation of Leo as it appeared at dawn on the springequinox in the epoch of 10,500 BC—a constellation that “descended from the sky”at Giza in the form of the Great Sphinx? And did the three belt stars of theconstellation of Orion as they looked in that distant epoch “descend from thesky” at Giza in the form of the ground plans of the three great pyramids?We’ve seen that the Sphinx, or at any rate large parts of it, could very wellhave been carved in the epoch of 10,500 BC. The pyramids were certainlycompleted much later, but it’s my belief that they were built over pre-existingstructures dating back to the time of the gods—gods whom the Edfu texts tell usquite explicitly were “capable of uniting with the sky.”2[part0118.html#chapter11-2] These pre-existing structures would, of course, havebeen hidden when they were replaced by the pyramids,3[part0118.html#chapter11-3] among them the original natural hill that anchorsthe whole plan and which was later incorporated into the structure of the GreatPyramid.Since the Edfu texts envisage the work of the gods as the re-creation in otherlands of their lost world, and since the key feature of that lost homeland was“a primeval temple that was erected on a low mound,”4[part0118.html#chapter11-4] it becomes all the more likely they would havesought to reproduce these features at Giza. At any rate, no lesser authoritythan Professor I.E.S. Edwards, formerly Keeper of Egyptian Antiquities at theBritish Museum, was of the view that the natural hill, now incorporated withinthe Great Pyramid, was indeed the Great Primeval Mound that is referred to sooften in Ancient Egyptian texts5 [part0118.html#chapter11-5]—a mound, we nowunderstand, that drew its sanctity from its predecessor that had once stood inthe lost world of the gods. That mound, Reymond tells us, formed “the originalnucleus of the world of the gods in the primeval age,”6[part0118.html#chapter11-6] so it follows that the rocky mound at the heart ofthe Great Pyramid, and later the Great Pyramid itself, served the same functionin the project to resurrect that lost world in Egypt.The Inventory Stela is by no means the only testimony to the existence ofancient plans connected with that project. We’ve seen in the Edfu texts howthese plans were part of an archive believed to have been set down in writing bythe wisdom god Thoth “according to the words of the Sages,”7[part0118.html#chapter11-7] so it is not surprising that the Ancient Egyptiansof later times became obsessed with “the books of Thoth,” which they appear tohave lost access to and which came to be regarded as the fount of all knowledge.A number of papyri have survived documenting searches for the books of Thoth,and these searches, not surprisingly, are always said to have taken place in thevicinity of Giza and the Memphite necropolis.There is, for example, the story of Setnau-Khaem-Uast, a son of Rameses II, oneof the great pharaohs of the thirteenth century BC. Informed that a “bookwritten by Thoth himself” lay concealed in an ancient tomb near Giza:Setnau went there with his brother and passed three days and nights seeking forthe tomb … and on the third day they found it [and] … went down to the placewhere the book was. When the two brothers came into the tomb they found it to bebrilliantly lit by the light which came forth from the book.8[part0118.html#chapter11-8]There seems to be a hint of an ancient technology here, reminiscent of Yima’sunderground Vara, which “glowed with its own light,” or of the mysteriousillumination of Noah’s Ark, described in Chapter Seven. What sound like theartifices of a lost technology are also mentioned in Arab traditions concerningGiza. The Egyptian historian Ibn Abd El Hakem believed that the pyramids werebuilt as places of safekeeping for antediluvian knowledge, prominently includingarchives of books containing:The profound sciences, and the names of drugs and their uses and hurts, and thescience of astrology, and arithmetic and geometry and medicine … [and]everything that is and shall be from the beginning to the end of time …9[part0118.html#chapter11-9]Hakem, who lived in the ninth century AD, could have known nothing of advancedmetallurgy or plastics, yet he stated that among the treasures from the timebefore the flood that were hidden away in the bowels of the pyramids were:arms which did not rust, and glass which might be bent but not broken.10[part0118.html#chapter11-10]He likewise described machines that guarded these antediluvian remnantsincluding:an idol of black agate sitting upon a throne with a lance. His eyes were openand shining. When anyone looked upon him, he heard on one side of him a voicewhich took away his sense, so that he fell prostrate upon his face, and did notcease until he died.11 [part0118.html#chapter11-11]A second machine also took the form of a statue:He who looked toward it was drawn by the statue until he stuck to it, and couldnot be separated from it until such time as he died.12[part0118.html#chapter11-12]Returning to the traditions of the Ancient Egyptians themselves, we have a textfrom the Westcar Papyrus, which dates to the Middle Kingdom, around 1650 BC, butwas copied from an older document now lost.13 [part0118.html#chapter11-13] Thetext makes reference to a “building called ‘Inventory,’” located in the sacredcity that the Ancient Egyptians knew as Innu, that the Bible calls On, and thatthe Greeks later made famous under the name of Heliopolis—the “City of theSun”—eleven miles northeast of Giza. According to the papyrus “a chest of flint”was stored in Heliopolis containing a mysterious document that Pharaoh Khufuhimself is reported to have “spent much time searching for”—a document thatrecorded “the number of the secret chambers of the sanctuary of Thoth” whichKhufu wished “to copy for his temple.”14 [part0118.html#chapter11-14]What are we dealing with here?image [../images/00043.jpeg]Figure 40: Heliopolis stands about eleven miles northeast of the pyramids ofGiza. Other than an obelisk in what is now the Cairo suburb of El Matariyaalmost nothing remains today of the ancient “City of the Sun”I.E.S. Edwards points out that Heliopolis, the site of the “Inventory Building,”had been a center of astronomical science closely connected to Giza since timeimmemorial, and that the title of the high priest of that city was “Chief of theAstronomers.”15 [part0118.html#chapter11-15] To this the Egyptologist F.W. Greenadds that the “Inventory Building” appears to have been a “chart room” atHeliopolis “or perhaps a ‘drawing room’ where plans were made and stored.”16[part0118.html#chapter11-16] Similarly, Sir Alan H. Gardiner argues that “theroom in question must have been an archive” and that Khufu “was seeking fordetails concerning the secret chambers of the primeval sanctuary of Thoth.”17[part0118.html#chapter11-17]So once again we are confronted by a report that Khufu sought out and consultedancient documents to guide his works at Giza—whether to restore the Sphinx toits original appearance, as we are told in the Inventory Stela, or to build his“temple” in the correct way, incorporating an ancient design as the WestcarPapyrus suggests. Such traditions, in my view, further strengthen the notionthat whatever Khufu and the other pharaohs of the Fourth Dynasty were doing atGiza was more of the order of the fulfillment and completion of plans they hadinherited from the time of the gods—antediluvian plans, in other words—than theimplementation of some novel scheme of their own. They were, in short, playingtheir part in the resurrection of the former world of the gods. Moreover, thesurface luminescence dating results reported in Chapter Ten, when taken togetherwith the geological arguments about the age of the Sphinx and its temples,invite us to consider that this process had originated in the flood epoch of10,500 BC, had then lain practically dormant for many millennia during which theancient knowledge and archives were maintained by initiates in something like amonastery, and then got underway again perhaps as early as the fourth milleniumBC with a gradual build-up to its completion and fulfillment in the epoch of2500 BC.The existence of such a college of initiates is signaled clearly in the Edfutexts which speak of the long-term mission of:the Builder Gods, who fashioned in the primeval time, the Lords of the Light …the Ghosts, the Ancestors … who raised the seed for gods and men … the SeniorOnes who came into being at the beginning, who illumined this land when theycame forth unitedly.18 [part0118.html#chapter11-18]The Edfu texts do not claim that these beings were immortal. After their deaths,we are told, the next generation “came to their graves to perform the funeraryrights on their behalf”19 [part0118.html#chapter11-19] and then took theirplaces. In this way, through an unbroken chain of initiation and transmission ofknowledge, the “Builder Gods,” the “Sages,” the “Ghosts,” the “Lords of theLight,” the “Shining Ones” described in the Edfu texts were able to renewthemselves constantly, like the mythical phoenix—thus passing down to the futuretraditions and wisdoms stemming from a previous epoch of the earth.Another name for these initiates, and an appropriate one given the importance ofHorus at Edfu, was the Shemsu Hor, the “Followers of Horus.”20[part0118.html#chapter11-20] Under this name they were particularly closelyassociated with Heliopolis/Innu, the sacred city where the records of the secretchambers of the sanctuary of Thoth were kept. The reader will recall that atEdfu it was the Seven Sages who specified the plans and designs that were to beused for all future temples throughout the length and breadth of Egypt, so it isinteresting that at Dendera, a little to the north of Edfu, inscriptions tell usthat the “great plan” used by its architects was “recorded in ancient writingshanded down from the Followers of Horus.”21 [part0118.html#chapter11-21]Identical in all respects to the “Sages” and the “Builder Gods” these Followersof Horus were said to have carried with them a “knowledge of the divine origins”of Egypt22 [part0118.html#chapter11-22] and of the divine purpose of this land,“which once was holy and wherein, alone, in reward for her devotion, the godsdeigned to sojourn upon earth.”23 [part0118.html#chapter11-23]Stones fallen from heavenThe nexus interlinking the Sages of the Edfu texts with Giza, Heliopolis and theFollowers of Horus offers a number of clues that will enable us to take thisinquiry forward. Among these, of the first importance, is the fact thatHeliopolis, an uninteresting suburb of Cairo today, was once the site of theTemple of the Phoenix—known in Ancient Egypt as the Bennu bird—that famoussymbol of resurrection and rebirth.24 [part0118.html#chapter11-24] In thistemple, often referred to as the “Mansion of the Phoenix,” was kept a mysteriousobject, long since lost to history, a “stone” called the Benben (a word closelylinked etymologically to Bennu25 [part0118.html#chapter11-25]) said to havefallen from heaven and depicted as the seed, the sperm, of Ra-Atum, the Fatherof the Gods. In the Ancient Egyptian language the determinative of the wordBenben, as one expert explains:shows a tapering, somewhat conical shape for the Benben stone which becamestylized for use in architecture as a small pyramid, the pyramidion; covered ingold foil it was held aloft by the long shaft of the obelisk and shone in therays of the sun, whom the obelisks glorified.26 [part0118.html#chapter11-26]Likewise the capstone of every pyramid was also referred to as its Benben27[part0118.html#chapter11-27]—an example in excellent condition has survived fromthe pyramid of the Twelfth Dynasty Pharaoh Amenemhat III and can be seen in theCairo Museum.Numerous theories have been put forward as to where the concept of the Benbencame from, but the most compelling, in my view, is the work of my friend andcolleague Robert Bauval that first appeared in the scholarly journal Discussionsin Egyptology in 1989 under the title “Investigation on the Origins of theBenben Stone: Was it an Iron Meteorite?” Similar to many other cases of theworship of meteorites by ancient peoples, Robert argued:it is likely that the Benben stone once worshipped in the Mansion of the Phoenixwas a meteorite. Its conical shape … is very suggestive of an oriented ironmeteorite, possibly a mass within the 1–15 ton range. Such objects fallen fromheaven were generally representative of “fallen stars” and likely provided theEgyptian clergy with a tangible star object, a “seed” of Ra-Atum.28[part0118.html#chapter11-28]A linked possibility was considered by the Egyptologist R.T. Rundle Clark in1949 in a paper entitled “The Origin of the Phoenix” for the University ofBirmingham Historical Journal. He drew attention to the earliest survivingmention of the Bennu bird, which is found in the Pyramid Texts (Old Kingdom,Fifth and Sixth Dynasties) and reads as follows:Thou [the god Ra-Atum is addressed] did shine upon the Benben Stone in the Houseof the Bennu bird in Heliopolis.29 [part0118.html#chapter11-29]But curiously, the Benben stone, always shown in later texts as a geometricalpyramidion,30 [part0118.html#chapter11-30] is depicted in the Pyramid Texts as arough stone with slightly curved sides. “This is an important fact,” observedRundle Clark, “since it shows that the pyramids were not exact copies of theoriginal benben stone in Heliopolis … One can assume that the Benben stonebecame a pyramidion during the Old Empire, but whether influenced by the actualdeveloped contour of the Fourth Dynasty pyramids cannot be determined.31[part0118.html#chapter11-31]He went on to note something else that caught my attention:The form of the Benben stone in [the Pyramid Texts] is that of an omphalos orbetyl, the umbilical stone which is so widespread in the early religion ofAsia … It is a lesson of this text … that the Benben stone is a betyl-likeobject and that it is modified into a pyramidion by the Fourth Dynasty.32[part0118.html#chapter11-32]What Rundle Clark did not appear to realize in his 1949 paper, and that stronglyreinforces Robert Bauval’s later argument, is that betyls, wherever they wereworshipped, were nothing more nor less than meteorites—although often they werestony rather than iron meteorites. I had occasion to investigate this issue insome depth in the 1980s when I was researching my book The Sign and The Sealwith specific reference to the two tablets of the Ten Commandments said to becontained within the Ark of the Covenant.33 [part0118.html#chapter11-33]Biblical scholar Menahem Haran, author of the authoritative Temples and TempleService in Ancient Israel, argues persuasively that “the Ark held not two tablesof the law but … a meteorite from Mount Sinai.”34 [part0118.html#chapter11-34]As such the ancient worship of the Ark and its contents fits in with a widertradition, distributed across the whole of the Near and Middle East, ofveneration of “stones that fell from heaven.”35 [part0118.html#chapter11-35]An example that has survived into the modern world is the special reverenceaccorded by Muslims to the sacred Black Stone built into a corner of the wall ofthe Ka’aba in Mecca. Touched by every pilgrim making the Haj to the holy site,this stone was declared by the Prophet Muhammad to have fallen from heaven toearth where it was first given to Adam to absorb his sins after his expulsionfrom the Garden of Eden; later it was presented by the angel Gabriel to Abraham,the Hebrew Patriarch; finally it became the cornerstone of the Ka’aba—the“beating heart” of the Islamic world.36 [part0118.html#chapter11-36]Geologists attribute a meteoric origin to the Black Stone.37[part0118.html#chapter11-37] Likewise the betyls—sacred stones—that somepre-Islamic Arab tribes carried on their desert wanderings were meteorites, anda direct line of cultural transmission is recognized linking these betyls (whichwere often placed in portable shrines) with the Black Stone of the Ka’aba andwith the stone “tablets of the law” contained within the Ark. In Europe betylswere also known and were called lapis betilis, a name:stemming from Semitic origins and taken over at a late date by the Greeks andRomans for sacred stones that were assumed to possess a divine life, stones witha soul [that were used] for divers superstitions, for magic and forfortune-telling. They were meteoric stones fallen from the sky.38[part0118.html#chapter11-38]With all this in mind, the special interest of Khufu in the “thunderbolt”mentioned in the Inventory Stela takes on a new significance. As the reader willrecall, the inscription speaks of the “Lord of Heaven”—an epithet forRa-Atum—“descending” on the Sphinx and inflicting the damage that Khufu wouldlater repair according to the ancient “plans” to which he had access. For such athunderbolt to be merely a lightning strike, as Selim Hassan suggests, makes nosense since the Inventory Stela tells us very clearly that Khufu visited thesite “in order to see the thunderbolt.”In short, an object that had fallen from the sky, and that could reasonably bedescribed as the result of the Lord of Heaven “descending” on the Sphinx, muststill have been physically present there. A meteorite satisfies this context butit could not, of course, have been the Benben kept at Heliopolis—for the Mansionof the Phoenix and the Benben already existed in Khufu’s time.39[part0118.html#chapter11-39] The Pharaoh’s eagerness to “see the thunderbolt”does, however, testify to the special reverence that was accorded to this classof objects, and it is natural to wonder what specific event that reverence goesback to—and how far it goes back.Could it, for example, go back all the way to the time memorialized in the Edfutexts—the time when the island of the gods was destroyed in the cataclysmicflood caused by the assault of the “enemy serpent,” so evocatively described asthe “Great Leaping One?”Before attempting to answer that question, let’s consider the Benben stone, andthe Bennu bird with which it is associated, a little more closely.The flight of the PhoenixR.T. Rundle Clark, who made an in-depth study of the Bennu–Phoenix, reports thatthe Ancient Egyptians believed in a “vital essence”—Hike—that had been broughtto their land:from a distant, magical source. The latter was “the Isle of Fire”—the place ofeverlasting light beyond the limits of the world, where the gods were born orrevived and whence they were sent into the world. The Phoenix is the chiefmessenger from this inaccessible land of divinity. A Coffin Text makes thevictorious soul say: “I came from the Isle of Fire, having filled my body withHike, like that bird who [came and] filled the world with that which it had notknown.”40 [part0118.html#chapter11-40]So the Phoenix came from far away, Rundle Clark concludes, “bringing the messageof light and life to a world wrapped in the helplessness of primeval night. Itsflight is the width of the world, ‘over oceans, seas and rivers,’ to land atlast in Heliopolis, the symbolic center of the earth where it will announce anew age.”41 [part0118.html#chapter11-41]There is much in this summary that is evocative of the Edfu texts—the far-offisland from which the gods are sent out, the return of the light after anepisode of primeval darkness, and an arrival at Heliopolis where a new age isset in motion. Indeed the Phoenix might almost be said to symbolize the missionof those “gods” who fled their drowned homeland with a long-term plan to bringabout the rebirth and renewal of the former world.But the symbolic crossovers go deeper than this and become more complex. ThePhoenix, remember, is closely associated not just with light but also with fire.Thus Lactantius writing in the fourth century AD tells us that the Phoenix:bathes in holy waters and feeds on living spray. After a thousand years … itbuilds a nest as a sepulcher, supplied with various rich juices and odors. As itsits on the nest its body grows hot enough to produce flames which in turn burnthe body to ashes destined to produce a milky white worm; the latter fallsasleep and then forms into an egg, eventually to sprout forth as a bird from thebroken shell. After taking nourishment it rolls the ashes into a ball enclosedin myrrh and frankincense, which the new-born bird transports to an altar in thecity of Heliopolis.42 [part0118.html#chapter11-42]This theme of fire and of regeneration and new life emerging from a fiery death,also crops up in ancient Iran where Yima built his Vara, and where the Phoenixwas called the Simorgh. As folklorist E.V.A. Kenealy explains, the accounts ofthe Simorgh decisively establish:that the death and revival of the Phoenix exhibit the successive destruction andreproduction of the world, which many believed to be effected by the agency of afiery deluge.43 [part0118.html#chapter11-43]Different lengthy periods—1000 years, 500 years, 540 years, 7006 years—are givenfor the life of the Phoenix before it dies in fire and then renews itself.44[part0118.html#chapter11-44] There is, however, a strong and very specifictradition, relayed, for example, by Solinus in the early third century AD, whichsets the period of the Phoenix at what seems to be a completely arbitrary andbizarre number—12,954 years.45 [part0118.html#chapter11-45] But furtherinvestigation reveals that “the period of the Phoenix’s return was thought tocorrespond to the Great Year”46 [part0118.html#chapter11-46] and the “GreatYear,” we already know, is an ancient concept linked to the Precession of theEquinoxes with its twelve “Great Months” (one for the sun’s passage through eachhouse of the zodiac) of 2,160 years each—thus 12 x 2,160 = 25,920 years. Thatfigure of 25,920 years is in turn, of course, very close to twice 12,954 years(2 x 12,954 = 25,908 years)—too close to be a coincidence, in my opinion,especially when we remember that Cicero in his Hortensius specifically linkedthe Great Year to the number 12,954.47 [part0118.html#chapter11-47]The figure of 540 years given in other sources for the period of the Phoenixalso turns out to be derived from the Great Year as Giorgo de Santillana andHertha von Dechend demonstrated in Hamlet’s Mill, their masterly study ofprecessional knowledge transmitted through myth. As we saw in Chapter Ten, theheartbeat of the precessional cycle is the number 72—the number of yearsrequired for one degree of precession. We then add 36 (half of 72) to the number72 to get 108; next we half 108 to get 54 and, finally, multiply 54 by 10 to get540. I went into all this in great detail in Fingerprints of the Gods twentyyears ago and refer the reader to that book for a full exposition of theseprecessional numbers,48 [part0118.html#chapter11-48] which are found in ancientmyths and traditions from all around the world and which Santillana and vonDechend long ago demonstrated are proof of advanced astronomical knowledge inthe deepest antiquity—knowledge that they attributed to some as yet unidentifiedand “almost unbelievable” ancestor civilization.49 [part0118.html#chapter11-49]What is particularly intriguing is how often ancient authorities connect thepassage of the Great Year, which we now see to be linked to the period of thePhoenix, to a “world conflagration” and a “world flood”—not necessarily as thecause of those cataclysms, but as a timer that records and predicts them. 50[part0118.html#chapter11-50] Confronted by such material, despite all theoddities and contradictions it has been weighed down with during the passage ofseveral millennia, I am forcibly reminded of the Younger Dryas comet and theconflagration and global flood that it brought in its wake—the latter caused bythe catastrophic collapse of large segments of the North American and northernEuropean ice caps as they were hit by multiple large fragments, the formercaused by superheated ejecta setting off forest fires across the minimum 50million square kilometers (19.3 million square miles) of the earth’s surfacethat were directly affected.What goes around comes aroundSuppose you wished to pass a message to the future, and not just the near futurebut the very distant future? You would be unwise to entrust it to writing,because you could not be certain that any civil-ization 12,000 years from nowwould be able to decipher your script. Besides, even if the script could bedeciphered, the written document on which you had placed your message might notsurvive the ravages of time. If you were really determined to be understood bysome distant future generation, you might therefore do better to devise yourmessage using gigantic architectural monuments that “time itself wouldfear”—monuments like the pyramids and the Great Sphinx of Giza—and to associatethose monuments with a universal language such as the slow precessional changesin the sky that any astronomically literate culture would be able to read.Ideally, also, your message should be a simple one.We saw in Chapter Ten how the Giza-Heliopolis-Memphis area perfectly fits thebill as one of the new sacred domains that the Edfu texts tell us wereestablished at various locations by the wandering “companies” of gods seeking tobring about the resurrection of the former world destroyed in the flood. It is,moreover, a domain that fully justifies the description of “a book descendedfrom the sky.” And when we “read” that book, written in the “script” ofprecession with the “pen” of megalithic architecture, it compels us to look atthe epoch of 10,500 BC—not an exact date, because the precessional “clock” givesindications that are too general to allow us to specify “seconds” or even“minutes,” but quite definitely to the epoch of 10,500 BC, i.e. about 12,500years ago. The same general astronomical configurations that are symbolized onthe ground by the great monuments of Giza would have held true for the best partof 500 years before 10,500 BC and for about 1000 years afterward.In other words, as we have seen, the “message” of the monuments exactlyencapsulates the cataclysmic episode of the Younger Dryas which began suddenlyand shockingly with the impacts of multiple fragments of a giant comet around10,800 BC, i.e. around 12,800 years ago, and which ended equally suddenly—we donot yet know why—around 9600 BC, i.e. around 11,600 years ago. The most likelyexplanation is that the earth interacted again in 9600 BC with the debris streamof the same fragmenting comet that had caused the Younger Dryas to start in10,800 BC. On the second occasion, however, the effects of the impacts wereglobal warming rather than global cooling.With comets, as with the mythical Phoenix, what goes around comes around.Since they are in orbit, they return to our skies at cyclic intervals—some asshort at 3.3 years (like Comet Encke for example), some longer than 4,000 years(such as Comet Hale-Bopp), some even running into tens of thousands of years.Like the mythical Phoenix, also, comets do literally undergo a process of“renewal”—indeed “rebirth”—on each appearance in our skies. This is becausecomet nuclei are usually inert and utterly dark while traveling through deepspace, producing no characteristic glowing “coma” and sparkling “tail.” However,as a comet approaches the sun (and thus also the earth) the solar rays causevolatile materials buried in its interior to burst into boiling, seethingactivity, producing jets of gas—scientists call the process “outgassing”—andshedding millions of tons of exceptionally fine dust and debris to form the comaand tail.Last but not least, outgassing comets, like the Phoenix, do have the appearanceof being consumed in flames. Moreover, the collision of large cometary fragmentswith the earth itself, as the scientists studying the Younger Dryas impact eventof 12,800 years ago have so graphically indicated, can be expected to result inconflagrations on a continent-wide scale followed, if impacts occur on icesheets, by global flooding.It is possible, indeed highly probable, that we are not yet done with the cometthat changed the face of the earth between 10,800 BC and 9600 BC. To be quiteclear, as we will see in Chapter Nineteen, some suspect that “the return of thePhoenix” will take place in our own time—indeed by or before the year 2040—andthere is a danger that one of the objects in its debris stream may be as much as30 kilometers (18.6 miles) in diameter. A collision with such a large cometaryfragment would, at the very least, mean the end of civilization as we know it,and perhaps even the end of all human life on this planet. Its consequenceswould be orders of magnitude more devastating than the Younger Dryas impacts12,800 years ago that left us as a species with amnesia, obliged to begin againlike children with no memory of what went before.Or rather with almost no memory.Because in our beginning again it seems we had the guidance, the leadership, theteachings, and the high wisdom of “the Sages,” “the Shining Ones”—those“Magicians of the Gods”—who had survived from antediluvian times and whosemission was to ensure that all was not after all lost. It doesn’t make sensethat they would have gone to such great lengths to spell out the epoch of 10,500BC at Giza just to say they were there. I suggest the science of theircivilization was high enough for them to have understood exactly what hadhappened to the world and to predict when it would happen again.I think, in short, that their purpose may have been to send us a message.We will look more deeply into that message, and its implications, in laterchapters, but first there is another trail of clues to follow, a trail that maylead us closer to the “Magicians” and their “magic.”"},{"pageContent":" Part V [part0131.html#c_part5]Stones [part0131.html#c_part5]"},{"pageContent":" Chapter 12 [part0131.html#c_ch12]Baalbek [part0131.html#c_ch12]We land at Beirut’s International Airport in the late evening of July 9, 2014.The airport is named after former Prime Minister Rafic Hariri, who wasassassinated on February 14, 2005 when his motorcade drove past a Mitsubishi vanparked outside the Saint George Hotel on the city’s fashionable Mediterraneanseafront—known as the Corniche. The van contained a young male suicide bomber(or so the very fragmentary DNA evidence suggests) and an estimated 1,800 kilos(about 4,000 pounds) of TNT. Twenty-three people, among them Hariri, several ofhis bodyguards, and his close friend and former Minister of the Economy BasselFleihan, were killed. Those suspected of organizing the massacre include seniormembers of Hezbollah, the Shia militant and political group that controls thetown of Baalbek in the Bekaa Valley, where there are certain intriguing ancientruins that I’m determined to see on this research visit to Lebanon. Hezbollahitself blames Israel. In addition, some suspect that President Bashar al-Assadof Syria was directly involved.1 [part0119.html#chapter12-1]The Syrian border runs along the eastern edge of the Bekaa Valley and very closeto Baalbek itself, which was hit by missiles in June 2013 and where there arerepeated violent incidents.2 [part0119.html#chapter12-2] With the horrendousSyrian civil war still in full swing, and huge numbers of refugees adding to thegeneral state of chaos and instability, we’ve been advised to stay away. ButI’ve wanted to see Baalbek for years and I feel all the more strongly drawn tothe ruins there after what I’ve learned researching Ancient Egypt.image [../images/00044.jpeg]Figure 41: Lebanon in its regional context.There are, you see, a number of puzzling connections and I have these very muchin mind, having been re-reading my notes on the flight, as Santha and I stepdown out of the plane onto the tarmac and make our way into the terminalbuilding. The night air is warm but a refreshing breeze blows in off theMediterranean, and I find myself looking forward to whatever adventures lieahead.Our first encounter is with bureaucracy in the form of an immigration officerwearing a gray uniform over an open-necked shirt. He is young but he has asallow, unhealthy complexion and an unshaved, suspicious look about him. Indeed,he is extremely suspicious, as he makes clear each time he glances up from mypassport to glare at me before returning to his forensic examination of thepages. My passport contains 41 pages with space for visas and I travelfrequently, so there are stamps from all over the world—Malaysia, Indonesia,Australia, South Africa, India, the United States, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Egypt,the United Arab Emirates, Canada, Turkey … The young officer studies each stampminutely, slowly leafing through the pages from front to back, glaring at me,returning to the investigation, glaring at me again. Then when he has reachedthe very last page, he repeats the procedure, this time leafing through fromback to front.I know what he’s looking for—a visa stamp for Israel, the presence of which willallow him to deny me entry. He won’t find one. Although my research has taken meto Israel several times, I’m always careful to get the entrance and exit stampson a loose sheet of paper placed inside my passport, rather than on the passportitself. Besides, my last visit was in 1999 and I’ve changed my passport twicesince then, so there’s nothing to be in the least bit concerned about. Even so,I have to admit I feel uncomfortable at this intense, sustained scrutiny.After going through the passport a third time, the officer gives me anotherhostile glare and asks: “Why you come to our country?”“Tourist,” I reply. I know from long experience that saying anything aboutresearching a book can lead to all manner of additional problems and suspicionsthat are best avoided.He raises a skeptical eyebrow. “Tourist?”“Yes. Tourist.”“And you see what, in our country?”I’m ready for the question. “Beirut. The beautiful Corniche. I’ve heard thereare some great restaurants. Then we’re going to Byblos and of course toBaalbek.”The eyebrow shoots up again. “Baalbek?”“Yes, of course! Wouldn’t miss it for anything.” This at least is true. “Thetemples. The big stones. I’ve heard it’s one of the wonders of the world.”Suddenly a smile. “Wonderful, yes! I am from Baalbek. My home town.” He stampsmy passport with a flourish and scrawls something in handwriting over the visa.“Welcome to Lebanon,” he says.Now it’s Santha’s turn, but with the ice broken, the officer only flips throughthe pages of her passport once before stamping it and directing us onward intothe baggage hall.Well of SoulsOn the drive in from the airport to our hotel we pass the place where RaficHariri was assassinated. The damage was long ago cleared away, of course,everything seems very chic and despite the late hour there are still a greatmany people, mostly young, mostly fashionably dressed, promenading along theCorniche overlooking the glittering waters of the Mediterranean, in which thestreet lights and the stars are pleasingly reflected. Amidst such a scene, it’shard to imagine the violence this city has witnessed during the past forty yearsand my thoughts turn again to the reasons we’ve come here.While I’ve been researching Egypt, and the hints of an ancient civilizingmission after a global cataclysm described in the Edfu texts, I’ve foundsomething odd that seems to suggest a possible link between the megalithicmonuments of the Giza plateau and Lebanon.A few thousand years ago Lebanon formed the northern sector of the land theBible refers to as Canaan, which also included the region covered, roughly, bymodern Israel, the Palestinian Territories, western Jordan and southwesternSyria. What interests me is that both in Israel and in Lebanon there aremysterious megalithic structures on a scale that not only rival those of Giza,but seem to express the same underlying purpose to create something that wouldlast—sacred mounds, holy places, that would withstand the test of time and thatwould continue to be venerated down the ages, even if the religions and culturesassociated with them changed.The Temple Mount in Jerusalem is one such place. Both orthodox archaeology andBiblical testimony put the construction of the first great edifices there backto the almost mythical time of King Solomon—that renowned magician amongmonarchs, who supposedly ruled in the tenth century BC. The structure known asSolomon’s Temple, the “First Temple” of the Jews, was destroyed by theBabylonians in 587 BC and rebuilt by Zerubbabel in the 520s BC.3[part0119.html#chapter12-3] A further ambitious restoration was undertaken bythe Romanized Jewish monarch Herod the Great in the first century BC andcompleted around 20 BC.4 [part0119.html#chapter12-4] Some ninety years after hisdeath, Herod’s Temple in its turn was destroyed by the Romans, along with muchof the city of Jerusalem, in 70 AD.5 [part0119.html#chapter12-5]What survived was the immense trapezoidal platform, known today as the Haramesh-Sharif, where stand the Al Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, the thirdand fourth most sacred places in Islam.6 [part0119.html#chapter12-6] We need notconcern ourselves here with the recent history of this place, or how it came tobe in Muslim hands, but the Dome of the Rock is so called because within it liesan enormous megalith, known to the Jews as the Shetiyah (literally the“Foundation”). When the Temple of Solomon was erected over this exact spot inthe tenth century BC, the Shetiyah formed the floor of the Holy of Holies andthe Ark of the Covenant, that enigmatic object which I have investigatedextensively in another book, stood upon it.7 [part0119.html#chapter12-7]The Shetiyah is not the only megalith in Jerusalem that dates back, potentially,to what the Edfu texts would call “the time of the gods.” Of course this hugenatural rock has been in this place, at the summit of a primeval mound, rathersimilar to the natural hill now enclosed within the Great Pyramid of Giza, foran incalculable period. But at some point, perhaps at the date in the tenthcentury BC that archaeologists accept for Solomon’s Temple, perhaps later,perhaps much earlier, it was modified by human beings and there is now a holecut through it which sheds a beam of light into the natural cave, also modifiedby human hands and evocatively known as the “Well of Souls,” that lies directlybeneath it.I’ve been in the Well of Souls several times. If it doesn’t have the rawatmospheric power of the Subterranean Chamber beneath the Great Pyramid, it isonly because local bad taste has allowed the Well to be tiled, carpeted,furnished and lit as a prayer room. But the way the great rock that covers ithas been cut and shaped is highly reminiscent of patterns that are found onrock-hewn surfaces at Giza. My guess, in short, as at Giza with its undergroundchamber beneath a natural hill, is that the rock and the Well formed theoriginal sacred shrine around which everything else on Jerusalem’s Temple Mountwas built.What came next was a platform, solidly founded, of gigantic stones, to createthe level, elevated surface upon which all later temples (and mosques) would bebuilt. It is not my intention to explore the mysteries of Jerusalem here, butbefore moving on to Baalbek, the main focus of the present chapter, I willsimply register surprise that the huge megalithic blocks which have beendiscovered in the so-called Hasmonean Tunnel lying to the north of, and directlyextending, the famous Wailing Wall—blocks weighing in some cases more than 500tons8 [part0119.html#chapter12-8]—have been so readily assumed to be Herod’swork.In the same way, the very similar gigantic megalithic blocks of Baalbek areassumed to be of relatively recent date—spanning the late first century BC tothe second half of the first century AD—and to be the work of the Romans, withperhaps some early contribution by Herod himself.9 [part0119.html#chapter12-9]But just as the history of the Giza plateau has been forced between narrow andrestricting bounds so, too, with Baalbek. Parts of it may be much older thanpresently believed.What led me to consider this possibility at all—indeed the entire reason I’m inBeirut in July 2014 and about to take a run over to the Bekaa Valley, Hezbollahand the Syrian border—is the weird connection that I’ve found linking Giza withancient Canaan, and with the ancient Semitic people known in the Bible as theCanaanites.The magician among the godsSelim Hassan (1887–1961) was what a real Egyptologist should be—passionate,erudite, deeply versed in his subject and open-minded. He was also a hands-onexcavator and, in the 1930s, carried out the most thorough and detailedinvestigation of just about every major structure on the Giza Plateau. In theprocess, while excavating the Sphinx enclosure, he came across evidence of aCanaanite presence at Giza—indeed a long-term Canaanite settlement—which, forsome reason, had been particularly focused on the Sphinx and its megalithictemples. “How these people came to settle in Egypt, and why and when they left,we have not, as yet, any written inscription to tell us,” Hassan admits.10[part0119.html#chapter12-10] That they were there from at least the EighteenthDynasty (1543 BC–1292 BC) is well attested, but the possibility cannot be ruledout that their stay in Egypt dates back long before that time.At any rate, numerous votive stele and other marks of respect to the GreatSphinx of Giza, inscribed and offered by members of this Canaanite community,have been found. We have seen already that the Sphinx was identified with theEgyptian god Horus, who could appear in many forms but most often as a falcon.Of interest, then, is the fact that the Sphinx in the Canaanite inscriptions iscalled Hurna, and sometimes Hauron. These are not Egyptian words at all, butinstead are the names of a Canaanite falcon deity.11[part0119.html#chapter12-11] The reader will also recall from Chapter Ten thatthe Ancient Egyptians often called the Sphinx Hor-em-Akhet (“Horus in theHorizon”). It turns out that this name is directly linked with Hurna in a numberof inscriptions, not only left by members of the Canaanite community that hadsettled near Giza, but also by the Ancient Egyptians themselves—for example, aplaque of Amenhotep II where the Pharaoh is referred to as “beloved ofHurna-Hor-em-Akhet.”12 [part0119.html#chapter12-12]Selim Hassan comments on “the assimilation of the names Hurna and Hor-em-Akhet”on Amenhotep’s plaque, which succinctly confirms the use of “the name of the godHurna in Egypt and its association with Hor-em-Akhet and application to theSphinx.”13 [part0119.html#chapter12-13] Likewise a stela found at Giza reads:“Adoration to Hor-em-Akhet in his name of Hurna … Thou art the only one who willexist till eternity, while all people die.”14 [part0119.html#chapter12-14] And asecond Giza stela represents Hurna in the form of a falcon beside an inscriptionwhich reads: “O Hurna-Hor-em-Akhet, may he give favor and love…”15[part0119.html#chapter12-15] Christiane Zivie-Coche, Director of ReligiousStudies at the Ecole pratique des hautes études in Paris, adds that the variantHauron was also frequently used in the same way:Hauron was so closely associated with Hor-em-Akhet, name of the Great Sphinx ofGiza … that one addressed him indifferently as Hor-em-Akhet, Hauron, orHauron-Hor-em-Akhet.16 [part0119.html#chapter12-16]What really caught my attention, however, and put me on the plane to Beirut, wasa further observation from Zivie-Coche. “An epithet on a Sphinx statuette,” shereported:indicates that Hauron is originally from Lebanon.17 [part0119.html#chapter12-17]Intriguing, too, in light of the civilizing work of “Sages” and “Magicians,” ofwhich there are so many traces in the Edfu texts and in the Mesopotamianinscriptions, is a baked clay tablet from the ancient city of Ugarit on theMediterranean coast of what is now Syria, a little to the north of Byblos inLebanon. Hauron is the subject of the tablet and, exactly like the Apkallu Sagesof Mesopotamia, he is portrayed as a “conjurer”18[part0119.html#chapter12-18]—indeed, notes Egyptologist Jacobus van Dijk, as:the magician among the gods …19 [part0119.html#chapter12-19]With further echoes of the Apkallu, Hauron’s “magic” consists of what sounds tothe modern ear like advanced scientific knowledge, in this case providinganti-venom, extracted “from among the shrubs of the tree of death”20[part0119.html#chapter12-20] that cured the victim of a deadly snakebite. Thepoison was neutralized, we read, so that it “became weak” and “flowed away likea stream.”21 [part0119.html#chapter12-21]And there is something else—something that points directly toward Baalbek withits mysterious megaliths—for not only was Hauron/Hurna worshipped at Giza andassimilated to the Sphinx and to the falcon Horus, but Baal, the Canaanite deityafter whom Baalbek is named,22 [part0119.html#chapter12-22] also had a cult inEgypt where he was associated with Set, the god of deserts and storms.23[part0119.html#chapter12-23]Last but not least, there is the fact that Baalbek was renamed“Heliopolis”—Greek for “City of the Sun”—after Alexander the Great conquered theLevant and Syria in 332 BC.24 [part0119.html#chapter12-24] The reader willrecall from Chapter Eleven that Innu, the sacred city of the Ancient Egyptians,where stood the Temple of the Phoenix attended by the priesthood of Giza, wasalso called “Heliopolis” by the Greeks. They referred to it as such from atleast the time of Herodotus in the fifth century BC,25[part0119.html#chapter12-25] and the Romans followed suit. Likewise Baalbekcontinued to be called “Heliopolis” throughout Roman times.Marching in Alexander’s footsteps, Pompey annexed the Levant and Syria in 64 BCand Roman power here reached its height in the first and second centuries AD,when a statue of “Jupiter the Most High and the Most Great of Heliopolis” stoodin the courtyard of the great temple that the Romans built at Baalbek in honorof this god.26 [part0119.html#chapter12-26] As well as its usual Romanattributes, the statue, which may be seen today in the Louvre Museum in Paris,displays a winged sun-disc on its chest—a possible reference, argues FriedrichRagette, formerly Professor of Architecture at the American University ofBeirut, “to the god of Egyptian Heliopolis.”27 [part0119.html#chapter12-27]It was not until the Arab conquests in the seventh century AD that the originalCanaanite name “Baalbek” began to reappear in Levantine annals, and it was onlythen that the city’s Graeco-Roman designation as “Heliopolis” fell entirely outof use. 28 [part0119.html#chapter12-28]Between Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon rangesThe morning after our late-night arrival in Beirut, Lebanese friends kindly joinus at our hotel to drive us to Baalbek. Over coffee before we go, they tell usof our good fortune: there is a lull in the fighting in Syria, all is calm alongthe border, and they expect no trouble.Seen in daylight the Lebanese capital is almost as charming and beautiful as itwas at midnight. One hundred and twenty thousand people were killed in thiscountry during the terrible and protracted civil war between 1975 and 1990, butthe city which was the focus of so much of the fighting seems to have put thatghastly episode behind it. Most of the bullet holes, shrapnel and blast woundsin the buildings have been repaired, there’s a lot of new construction going onand the atmosphere is one of optimism and vigorous enterprise. Yes, there issadness in the air—it’s unavoidable after so much murder and mayhem—but thesense I get is of a nation recovering from its trauma, not wallowing in it,filled with bright, intelligent young people who are determined to move ahead.image [../images/00045.jpeg]Figure 42The traffic is heavy as we wind our way up the steep foothills of the LebanonMountains to the east of the capital. It’s only 86 kilometers (about 53 miles)to Baalbek but there are frequent military checkpoints, where we’re filteredthrough chicanes and inspected by attentive, heavily armed soldiers. Inevitablythis slows us down. The views, however, get more and more spectacular with theMediterranean gleaming behind us and the great, green, tree-strewn ridges of theLebanon range rising ahead of us. The road wraps itself around multiple tighthairpin bends above vertiginous drops, the air becomes notably cooler and thelandscape more barren. Then we’re over the top through the Dahar el Baydar passat an altitude of 1,556 meters (5,100 feet) and motoring down the other sidewith the broad, intensively cultivated sweep of the Bekaa Valley opening outbelow us. We pass the edge of the urban sprawl of Zahle, famous for its KsaraWinery, and pretty soon we’re running through the Bekaa proper—although it isreally a plateau rather than a valley since its average elevation is more than1,000 meters (3,280 feet) above sea level.Bounded on the west by the Lebanon Mountains over which we’ve just driven, andon the east by the Anti-Lebanon range, the Bekaa is watered by two historicrivers—the Litani and the Orontes. When the Romans colonized the region twothousand years ago, this fertile plateau was one of their breadbaskets,exporting grain to feed the empire. Today a more lucrative crop, though largelyhidden from view, is cannabis. In the interests of keeping local farmers happy,the authorities generally turn a blind eye.After another thirty or forty minutes of mainly level driving on a long,straight stretch of road with cultivated fields on either side, we enter theoutskirts of Baalbek at the edge of the Anti-Lebanon foothills. It’s a shabbytown of shops, offices and dilapidated low-rise apartment blocks, many festoonedwith the Hezbollah flag featuring an upraised arm at the end of which is a handclenched into a fist around an AK-47 assault rifle. Hand, arm and Kalashnikovemerge from a line of calligraphy spelling out Hezbollah’s name—“Party of God.”Other lettering states “Then surely the party of Allah are they that shall betriumphant” and, separately, “the Islamic resistance in Lebanon.” The backgroundcolor of the flags is a strident yellow, while the logo and calligraphy arepicked out in green.Fashions and preferences in gods come and go, but the sacred landscape endures.On an eminence above the town we can clearly see the spectacular remains, thesoaring columns, and the lofty pediments of the group of three Roman templesthat bestowed such renown upon Baalbek in the ancient world. Dedicated,supposedly, to Jupiter, Bacchus and Venus, they were built on a scale larger andmore imposing than almost any other Roman structures, including those in Romeitself. What really interests me, however, is the megalithic wall that surroundsthe Temple of Jupiter on three sides, and in particular the three giganticblocks, known as the Trilithon, that are embedded in it. Much that I’ve learnedabout the Trilithon in my prior research has led me to suspect that it may beolder—far older—and dedicated to a far more enigmatic purpose than anything theRomans built here.Now’s my chance to find out.Centuries of darknessThe mid-morning sun is beating down out of an absolutely cloudless clear bluesky and I’m sitting on a big limestone block roughly in the middle of what wasonce the Temple of Jupiter. I say “once” because there’s very little of thistowering edifice left standing now, other than the six immense columns that rearskywards about the width of a football field behind me—the last six out of thetotal of fifty-four that originally demarcated the exterior of the vastrectangular structure. This site is so enormous, the complex of temples socolossal and at the same time so ruined that I’m finding it difficult to get mybearings. Also, I have to confess, the long echoing booms of distant artillery,punctuated by the rapid, stuttering coughs of heavy machine guns, and anoccasional very loud explosion, are a little disconcerting.OK, I think, deliberately shutting my ears to the sounds that are, almostcertainly, only the Lebanese military doing some practice firing, let’s figureout what we’ve got here. I glance over my shoulder and when I do I’m lookingroughly southeast, through the six big columns which stand on the edge of themassive platform I’m in the midst of, across a sunken plaza, to the row of adozen columns that line the northern perimeter of the smaller, but more intactand still very beautiful Temple of Bacchus, the Roman god of wine.I’m not here to research or write about Roman architecture but still I’mimpressed. Not only did the Romans have the sense of fun to dedicate a temple towine and all its pleasures—reportedly joyous acts of sexual license regularlytook place within—but also, let’s not beat around the bush here, these peoplereally knew how to build! The columns themselves are extraordinary feats ofmegalithic architecture, and the Romans seem to have had no difficulty inhauling the ponderous blocks of the pediment, each weighing tens of tons—and insome cases hundreds of tons—up to the top of them.So let’s be clear about this, right from the start, because there is so muchignorant baloney talked on the subject: the Romans were incredibly accomplishedbuilders and they were absolutely capable of moving and placing monstrously hugeand heavy blocks of stone. If there’s an argument to be made for a lostcivilization at Baalbek then it can’t be based on the block weights, or onnaïve, ill-informed notions about what the Romans could or couldn’t do, becausein the realm of building, the evidence all around me confirms they could dopretty much anything they chose to.One of the things they frequently did was build their temples on pre-existingsacred sites. Their objective was not to obliterate the indigenous gods andreligions (as the Spanish sought to do in Mexico, for example, when theyinstalled churches on the site of Aztec temples), but rather to associate thegods and religion of Rome in a positive way with what had gone before. Thepre-Roman cults usually continued to flourish and the pre-Roman deities werehonored and absorbed in a rich, creative and endlessly proliferating syncretism.But for those doing archaeological forensic work to try to establish exactly whowas responsible for what, and when, this practice of overbuilding inevitablypresents some challenges—particularly so, as is the case at Baalbek, when otherlater cultures, and the ravages of time, have also continuously modified thesite.Toward the end of the Roman era bad things began to happen here. The turningpoint was Rome’s conversion, under the Emperor Constantine (AD 306–37), to thenew fanatical, exclusivist religion of Christianity. The militants of that faithfocused their beady eyes first on the Temple of Venus, described by theChristian chronicler Eusebius as “a school to learn sensual practices,” whereinitiates indulged “in all kinds of debauchery.”29 [part0119.html#chapter12-29]Constantine gave orders that the temple should be destroyed completely (in theevent it wasn’t).30 [part0119.html#chapter12-30] Julian the Apostate (AD 361–3)detested Christianity and reinstated the old gods. Then Theodosius (AD 379–95)took the throne and the Christians were back in power with a vengeance.“Constantine the Great contented himself with closing the temples,” reports theChronicon Paschale:but Theodosius destroyed them. He transformed into a Christian Church the templeof Heliopolis, that of Baal-Helios, the Great Sun-Baal, the celebratedTrilithon.31 [part0119.html#chapter12-31]Some hundreds of years later the Islamic era began. Around AD 664 Baalbek wasbesieged and captured by a Muslim army that converted the Temple of Jupiter andthe Temple of Bacchus, immediately south of it, into a single large fortress.Various factions then held Baalbek and continued to fortify it (indeed, to thisday, it is often still referred to in Arabic as the Kala’a, meaning the“fortress”32 [part0119.html#chapter12-32]). In the process, of course, theancient temples suffered further destruction. In AD 902 the Karmates, adissident Shia sect, besieged and captured Baalbek, slaughtering the defenders.The Fatimites seized it in AD 969. Four years later, a Muslim General namedZamithes arrived with a huge army and another devastating siege and massacrefollowed.33 [part0119.html#chapter12-33]A Greek-Christian army set Baalbek on fire in 996; by 1100 it was in the handsof the Seljuk, Tadj Eddolat Toutoush. In 1134 it was besieged by Zinki, who “forthree months hurled on its ramparts a storm of projectiles” using “fourteencatapaults working day and night.”34 [part0119.html#chapter12-34]In 1158 Baalbek was struck by an earthquake of “unparalleled violence” that“destroyed the fortress and the temples.” Noureddin, the son of Zinki “hastenedto Baalbek to repair the damage which the earthquake had done to theramparts.”35 [part0119.html#chapter12-35]In 1171 a force of captured European Crusaders who were being held prisoner inthe fortress staged an uprising, in which they slaughtered the garrison and tookpossession of the citadel, but were soon slaughtered in their turn by a Muslimarmy that broke in through an underground passage. In 1176 the Crusaders wereback. They attacked and pillaged Baalbek. Soon afterward, in 1203 there wasanother massive earthquake that caused further extensive damage.36[part0119.html#chapter12-36]In 1260 the Tartar Sultan, Holako, besieged Baalbek, captured it and destroyedit. “Not even the fortifications were spared”—a folly that the Tartars came toregret when King Daher Bibars attacked them and expelled them. He gave ordersthat the fortress of Baalbek—which, let us not forget, was the site of theancient temples—should immediately be rebuilt and its walls reconstructed. In1318, however, nature took a hand again and a fearsome flood undermined theramparts making several wide breaches. “The water rushed in with such force thatit lifted a tower 12 meters [39 feet] square to a distance of 400 meters [1,312feet].”37 [part0119.html#chapter12-37]Next came the Turko–Mongol conqueror, Timur. In 1491, after capturing thecitadel and subduing all resistance there, he gave it up “to the rapacity of hissoldiers who pillaged it ruthlessly.” By 1516, when Baalbek became part of theOttoman empire, the fortress and its temples were “completely ruined.”38[part0119.html#chapter12-38]In this state they were seen by the English architect Robert Wood in 1751, whosedetailed drawings of the site show nine of the original fifty-four columns ofthe Temple of Jupiter still intact. Then in 1759 another fearsome earthquakestruck, leaving only the six standing columns that I now sit in front of as Imull over the tumultuous history of this ancient sacred place.39[part0119.html#chapter12-39]The question I’m asking myself is this—after so many cycles of construction,destruction and rebuilding, how much can archaeology really claim to know aboutthe site? As Michael Alouf, the former Curator of Baalbek, confirms:Unfortunately this temple has suffered greatly through the ravages of time andthe vandalism of the ignorant; its walls have been demolished, its columnsoverthrown and its foundations undermined. There only remain the six columns ofthe southern peristyle, four broken columns on their bases in the northernperistyle within the Arab fortifications, and the socles [plinths] of theperistyle of the façade. The Byzantine Emperors were the first who began todestroy the temple, using the building material thus obtained for theconstruction of [a] basilica. The Arabs followed their example, extracting fromthe walls and the foundations of the temple any blocks of stone likely to beuseful in fortifying the weak spots of the ramparts.40[part0119.html#chapter12-40]Undoubtedly the German Archaeological Institute, who have the concession forthis site (as they have also for Göbekli Tepe in Turkey) are doing their best.In the process, however, they have revealed even more deeply confusing layers ofcomplexity and have been obliged to overturn what was for a long while themainstream consensus that the first builders at Baalbek were the Romans.41[part0119.html#chapter12-41] Far from it! Indeed, under the place where I’msitting now, which was in the midst of the area that once formed the cella—theinner chamber—of the Temple of Jupiter, are the remains of a far more ancientsacred mound. Such mounds are known as “Tells” in this region, andarchaeologists now admit that “Tell Baalbek” goes back at least 10,000 years42[part0119.html#chapter12-42]—i.e. 8,000 or more years before the Romans arrivedhere! “A long sequence of Neolithic settlement layers … most probably thePre-Pottery Neolithic,”43 [part0119.html#chapter12-43] has been excavated,pushing the origins of Baalbek very close to the time when Göbekli Tepeflourished in nearby Turkey.Megalithic wall northThe artillery fire is still going on in the background, but it’s one of thosenoises you tune out after a while. I get up off the warm comfortable block I’vebeen sitting on and make my way a few dozen paces north, across what would havebeen the floor of the Temple of Jupiter, until I come to its northern edge(marked by a few broken columns, still upright on their plinths like the stubsof rotten teeth) set into a later—very makeshift and higgledy-piggledy—Arabfortification wall. Into the wall, at intervals, are built embrasures with loopholes through which defenders fired arrows down on their attackers. Peeringnorth through one of these loopholes, I can just see the top of a truly massiverow of megaliths perhaps (I’m guessing) 20 or 25 feet below me. I count nine ofthem and note that they’re separated from the base of the wall in which theembrasure is set by a horizontal distance of—another rough guess—35 feet. In thegap, which is overgrown with grass and bushes, are many fallen, broken blocks ofstone.In order to get a better view of this strange megalithic wall I continue to walkwestward along the northern margin of the Temple of Jupiter, until I get toanother part of the Arab fortifications that were later added onto it, theso-called “Northwest Tower.” I can step out onto this—there’s a convenientterrace with a commanding view—and look back from it in an eastward directionalong the huge megaliths, set out in a row below me, and down into the overgrowngrassy gap that separates them from the wall of the temple platform.image [../images/00046.jpeg]Figure 43I’ll not try to explain yet what those megaliths are. There are enough confusingfactors already! But we’ll return to them shortly when, hopefully, all willbecome clear. Meanwhile I exit the Arab tower, walk back into the hugerectangular space it leads off, where the Temple of Jupiter once stood, andcross it heading east until I come to the steps that once led up to the temple’sentrance. I descend the steps, then turn westward again into the sunken plaza,bounded by the platform of the Temple of Jupiter to the north and by the Templeof Bacchus to the south.The transmission of knowledgeNaturally I check out the wine god’s sanctuary. It’s beautiful, with a strongenergy of its own, and I’m sure a lot of joy was celebrated here in antiquity.But there’s a more serious side, too, hinting that the Romans were therecipients of a stream of ancient knowledge and symbolism with its origins inthe remotest antiquity—a stream, though divided into many channels, thatcontinues to flow to this day.Freemasons who have studied the Temple of Bacchus point to a number of reliefsand designs here that are meaningful to them. For example, on the underside of ahuge stone ceiling block, still balanced on the columns of the temple, appearsthe device known as the “Seal of Solomon”—a six-pointed star inscribed within acircle. According to leading US Freemason Timothy Hogan, Grand Master of theKnights Templar Order, the figure in the center of the star is depicted “givinga sign that would be familiar to Entered Apprentices.” Another relief shows twofigures “sitting side by side and making gestures that would have meaning to aFellowcraft in Freemasonry.”44 [part0119.html#chapter12-44]It’s also noteworthy at the Temple of Bacchus, and indeed throughout Baalbek,how much evidence there is for the veneration of the god of wisdom whom theRomans called Mercury—the Greek Hermes—whom the Ancient Egyptians knew as Thothand connected, as we saw in Chapter Nine, to the traditions of the SevenSages.45 [part0119.html#chapter12-45] Another curious link is that the cult ofMercury in its earliest forms involved the use of betyls,46[part0119.html#chapter12-46] discussed in Chapter Eleven, which were originally“stones fallen from heaven”—in other words, meteorites and thus often part ofthe debris stream of fragmenting comets. When we recall that the Black Stone ofthe Ka’aba in Mecca is said to be a meteorite, it’s interesting that Baalbek inantiquity was the site of a famous oracle (the Roman Emperor Trajan reportedlyheld it in great esteem), and that it was “a black stone which answeredquestions.”47 [part0119.html#chapter12-47]Some scholars believe the Temple of Bacchus was jointly dedicated to Mercury,48[part0119.html#chapter12-48] but since I’m not in Baalbek to explore Romanarchitecture I won’t describe it further. It’s the Temple of Jupiter, and itstangled prehistoric past that really interests me—particularly its relationshipthrough the platform on which it stands with the earlier constructions goingback to the time of Göbekli Tepe.Again, sorting out the different phases is difficult and I’m determined not tobe lured by the trap that so many “alternative” historians have falleninto—namely to conclude, when we see huge megaliths, that super-advanced, even“alien” technologies must have been involved in moving them and lifting them. AsI’ve already said, I don’t dispute that the Romans could and did move enormousblocks of stone when they wanted to. Indeed, the evidence for that is all aroundme in the space between the Temple of Bacchus and the Temple of Jupiter, whereheaps of carved and engraved blocks from the fallen pediments of both structureslie scattered. They are, without question, Roman, some of them weigh in therange of 100 tons or more, one weighs 360 tons,49 [part0119.html#chapter12-49]and all of them were raised almost 70 feet (21 meters) above the ground—theheight of the columns on which they were perched.50 [part0119.html#chapter12-50]I walk north through these ruins, back toward the Temple of Jupiter, looking upnow at its six remaining giant columns, each one of them composed of threeenormous blocks and each standing on a monolithic stone plinth almost 9 feet(2.7 meters) high.51 [part0119.html#chapter12-51] You’d have to be a fool toargue that the Romans didn’t make and raise up those columns, or the pedimentsabove them, because it’s completely obvious on stylistic grounds, and on thebasis of comprehensive archaeological research, that they did.However, as noted earlier, the Romans were themselves both the inheritors andthe transmitters of sometimes extremely archaic traditions and it may not be anaccident that the Temple of Jupiter originally boasted fifty-four columns. Thereader will recall the phenomenon of precession discussed in Chapters Ten andEleven, and the mystery of “precessional numbers,” encoded in ancient myths andtraditions from all around the world, which Professors Giorgio de Santillana andHertha von Dechend take as proof of advanced astronomical knowledge handed downfrom some as yet unidentified and “almost unbelievable” ancestor civilization.It so happens that 54 is one of the sequence of precessional numbers. It derivesfrom 72, the number of years required for one degree of precessional motion. Wethen add 36 (half of 72) to 72 itself to get 108 and divide 108 by two to get54. In their groundbreaking study Hamlet’s Mill, Santillana and von Dechendpoint to the avenues of statues at Angkor in Cambodia, “108 per avenue, 54 oneach side,” as examples of deliberate precessional symbolism52[part0119.html#chapter12-52]—so why not the fifty-four columns of the Temple ofJupiter at Baalbek as well?Megalithic wall southMy eye tracks down from the top of the six remaining columns past their hugeplinths, to the wall of moderate quarter-ton blocks that they surmount (formingthe southern edge of the Temple of Jupiter) and down again to the base of thatwall which in turn is flanked by a row of nine colossal megaliths that are eachabout 32 feet long, 13 feet high and 10 feet wide (9.5 meters by 4 meters by 3meters).53 [part0119.html#chapter12-53] These monster blocks weigh somewhere inthe range of 400 tons each. A number of them, those furthest toward the west,have a nicely finished appearance, with the stone smoothed and polished and theupper half trimmed in to be narrower than the base. But others are rough, stillshowing the “boss,” the protective layer that masons leave on the surface toprotect the ashlar from damage while it is being transported to the site.54[part0119.html#chapter12-54]The quarry these blocks were brought from has been identified. It’s about 800meters (half a mile) to the south. I don’t doubt that cutting and moving themwould have been within the technical capacity of the Romans, the greatest andmost ingenious builders of the historical antiquity. Still the question must beasked—are these blocks their work? Or someone else’s? The question must beasked, because the nine blocks I’m looking at now are part of the samestupendous, megalithic wall to which belong the nine equally gigantic blocks Isaw earlier on the north side of the complex. That northern row of megaliths andthis southern row of megaliths form the northern and southern “arms” of a singlegigantic “U”-shaped wall that surrounds the Temple of Jupiter to the north,south and west with the base of the “U”—in which is set the fabled Trilithonthat I’ve come here to see—oriented west.As usual with Baalbek, as though this were not complicated enough, there arefurther complications! These have been explored by Daniel Lohmann, an extremelythorough and really quite brilliant German architect and archaeologist, who hasspent years excavating and closely examining this site and who, in February2015, was gracious enough to engage in correspondence with me and to give me thebenefit of his extensive knowledge. It’s his opinion, which I’ll go into in moredepth in the next chapter, that the awe-inspiring U-shaped megalithic wallsurrounding the Temple of Jupiter is one hundred percent Roman.His case is that it was part of what was intended to become an immensepodium—let us follow the logic of his argument and call it “Podium 2”—with whichwhoever commissioned the temple (and since there are zero contemporary recordswe don’t know who that was55 [part0119.html#chapter12-55]) wished to surroundhis “megalomaniac” masterpiece.56 [part0119.html#chapter12-56] The upshot ofLohmann’s investigation is that within the U-shaped wall of Podium 2 are theremains of what he sees as an earlier building phase, which he refers to as“Podium 1.”57 [part0119.html#chapter12-57] His investigations show thedimensions of Podium 1 to be 12 meters (39 feet) in height by 48 meters (157feet)north to south, by 95 meters (312 feet) east to west, but, he admits, “theonly certain clue” to its age “is that it pre-dates the Julio Claudian temple”58[part0119.html#chapter12-58] (i.e. the Temple of Jupiter which was built in themain by the Julio-Claudian dynasty, spanning the reigns of the EmperorsAugustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Nero, 27 BC–AD 68). To cut a longstory short, Lohmann argues that Podium 1 was the work of Herod the Great, theRoman client king who ruled Judea in the last decades of the first century BC.But there are no inscriptions or other documentary evidence that could settlethe matter, so “the only source of information is the well-preserved structureitself,”59 [part0119.html#chapter12-59] notably its stylistic features:such as the use of alternating rows of headers and stretchers, drafted-marginmasonry and the reconstruction of the plan of this early structure. Theseelements reveal surprisingly close parallels to Herodian sanctuaries, and inparticular the Temple at Jerusalem, not only in general appearance but in theirprecise proportions and measurements. These correspondences between the twobuilding projects strongly suggest Herodian involvement … even though itsprecise nature remains to be determined.60 [part0119.html#chapter12-60]As we’ve seen, the Jerusalem Temple was destroyed by the Romans in AD 70, soLohmann is obliged to base his argument on “the only surviving part of theTemple, the gigantic trapezoidal platform of the Haram-esh-Sharif.”61[part0119.html#chapter12-61] Nonetheless, the detailed comparisons he offers do,indeed, make an excellent case for “Herodian involvement” in Baalbek’s Podium 1.What remains to be settled, however, is how extensive this involvement was. Tobe specific, although Lohmann concedes that “Tell Baalbek … was continuouslyinhabited since the pre-pottery Neolithic period”62[part0119.html#chapter12-62]—i.e. since the time of Göbekli Tepe—and althoughhis whole argument is that the Julio-Claudian Emperors worked around Podium 1 atBaalbek when they started to build the massive and imposing U-shaped wall forPodium 2, he doesn’t consider the possibility that there might have been a“Podium 0,” which Herod in turn overbuilt.I can hardly blame him for that, since no mainstream archaeologist that I’maware of is willing to consider the same possibility for Herod’s restoration ofthe Jerusualem Temple—particularly with reference to the huge megalithic blocks,discussed earlier, that now stand exposed by the Hasmonean Tunnel. Neverthelessit’s a possibility that shouldn’t be ignored at Baalbek, especially in the lightof what Lohmann himself describes as the “great antiquity” of the site.63[part0119.html#chapter12-63]And there’s another possibility as well, which I intend to consider. It concernsthe megalithic U-shaped wall that forms the base and boundary of the featureLohmann calls Podium 2. Suppose that U-shaped wall isn’t Roman at all? Supposeit was already in place before, not after, Herod built Podium 1? Suppose,further, that the Tell that antedates Podium 1 by thousands of years was itselfsituated where it is because of the prior existence of the U-shaped megalithicwall? In other words, suppose the U-shaped wall with its immense megaliths wasthe very first work of architecture to be built on this site, perhaps enshriningsome central feature, some primeval mound, in front of which the Tell laterevolved over thousands of years, until the Herodian Temple was built on top ofit, and then a little later overbuilt by the Temple of Jupiter?TrilithonHaving climbed a stairway set against the side of a monstrously large block—thescale of everything here is truly epic!—I make my way along the top of the rowof 13-feet high, 400-ton megaliths that form the southern elevation of theU-shaped megalithic wall that Lohmann sees as part of the—never completed—Podium2. I’m heading west now and I pass under the six standing columns, which seemless to loom than to take flight over me, so light and graceful do they appeardespite their massive size. The wall they’re perched on rises to about twice myheight; its upper edge—where the columns stand—marks the level of the floor ofthe Temple of Jupiter, where I’d sat earlier. The space between the wall and theedge of the 10-feet wide megaliths I’m walking on is an obstacle course ofbroken fragments of columns and ornate multi-ton chunks of the pediment theyonce supported.At the end of the long row of megaliths I’m confronted by a warren of towers,archways and tumbledown, medieval Arab fortifications. I thread my way throughthese—it’s all a bit bewildering!—climb a flight of stairs and take a right turninto a narrow alley at the western edge of the whole complex. I’m heading northnow and the alley, which isn’t wide enough for two people to pass abreast, runsbetween the outer fortification wall on my left—part Roman, part Arabreconstruction—and a row of rough-hewn megalithic blocks on my right. I don’tknow what to make of these blocks but a few months later, in correspondence weeventually engage in, Lohmann will tell me that they’re:part of a filling layer … that was intended to fill up space between theHerodian wall and the later megaliths which make up the exterior shell of thesecond, Julio-Claudian podium. They were intended to be invisible behind theshell, so they remained undressed, and with a rough surface.64[part0119.html#chapter12-64]Whatever they are, these massive blocks are separated by little more than thewidth of my shoulders from the hybrid Roman wall extended by Arab fortificationsto my left. The feeling is one of constriction, almost claustrophobia. Aftertwenty paces, or so, however, the alley widens as the outer fortification wall,previously several courses thick suddenly reduces to a single course which, justahead, has a large gap in it through which I peer down onto a grassy border,some 35 or 40 feet below, edged by the modern fence that surrounds the whole ofthe Baalbek complex.That’s when I realize for sure—I’d been half expecting it, but I wasn’t certainuntil this moment—that I’m standing on what I’ve come to Baalbek to see. It’sjust over 64 feet long, more than 14 feet high, nearly 12 feet wide and weighsmore than 800 tons.65 [part0119.html#chapter12-65]It’s the southernmost of the three famed megaliths of the Trilithon."},{"pageContent":" Chapter 13 [part0131.html#c_ch13]And Then Came the Deluge … [part0131.html#c_ch13]I’d hoped, I’d expected, I was almost sure, that the course I’d charted throughthe ruins would lead me to the Trilithon, but still I feel a minor sense oftriumph that my wanderings in the labyrinth have actually brought me to thisvery special place!It’s a good moment to take stock. That single course of outer-fortificationmasonry to my west barely covers a quarter of the Trilithon’s immense width.There’s part of the drum of a fallen column lying just by the gap in thefortifications that overlooks the grassy border within the perimeter fencesurrounding the ruins. Pressed against the fortification wall this column coversapproximately half the width of the huge megalith it rests on, the southernmostof the three in the Trilithon. All in all this is a sheltered spot, a quietspace, a little courtyard almost. Conveniently there’s a loose block about theheight of a stool for me to perch on, and what’s more, since it’s afternoon now,there’s a patch of shade.With a sigh of relief I sit down, haul out my notebook and compose my thoughts.I’m aware, as I do so, that my feet are placed not only on the Trilithon block,but also on something inscribed into it that effectively proves it is older thanthe Temple of Jupiter, though not how much older. The shade is working againstme, the fifty years since it was first brought to light have not been kind toit, and honestly I can’t see it. However, Professor Haroutune Kalayan, theengineer placed in charge of the restorations of Baalbek by the LebaneseDepartment of Antiquities, explains that back in the mid-1960s, “In view of thescientific interest, Emir Maurice Chehab, Director General of the AntiquityDepartment, decided to have the top of the Trilithon cleared…” When this wasdone:The south block … exposed a full-scale orthographic drawing of the pediment ofthe Temple of Jupiter. The drawing partly extends under Roman construction andpartly it is hidden under an early period Arabic construction … This … discoverysuggests that the Trilithon was already in place to serve as a trestle board forthe dimensioning and ordering of the pediment blocks; that is, in the beginningof the second half of the first century AD. Further, it can be concluded thatafter the construction of the pediment, after the drawing had served itspurpose, the constructional scheme above the level of the Trilithon [was]executed; this is why part of the drawings extend under the Romanconstructions.1 [part0120.html#chapter13-1]So right here, at my feet, unfortunately invisible now without special lighting,is a convincing piece of evidence that a real mystery, not just one made up byalternative historians, surrounds the Trilithon. Obviously, since it was usedfor an architectural drawing of part of the Temple of Jupiter, as Kalayanadmits, and particularly so since it was afterward partially covered by Romanconstruction, the only logical deduction is that it must be older than thetemple.We’ll look further into the implications of this, but it should be noted rightat the outset that Daniel Lohmann doesn’t agree. Presenting a paper for theProceedings of the Third International Congress on Constructional History, heldin the German city of Cottbus, in May 2009, he argued:Kalayan suggested that this drawing proves the Trilithon to be older and alreadyin place when the temple was built. Today, new indications show that thisassumption is outdated, and that the Trilithon and temple were builtsynchronous. The upper surface of this block [the southernmost Trilithon blockwith the drawing on it] was practically used for a simultaneous construction,later simply to be covered by the next stone course.2[part0120.html#chapter13-2]And in a follow-up paper in 2010, Lohmann expanded on his reasoning:The unfinished pre-Roman sanctuary construction [Podium 1] was incorporated intoa master plan of monumentalization. Apparently challenged by the already hugepre-Roman construction, the early imperial Jupiter sanctuary shows both anarchitectural megalomaniac design and construction technique in the first halfof the first century AD. The most famous example may be the Trilithon formingthe middle layer of the western temple podium … The podium can be considered asan attempt to hide the older, inconveniently shaped temple terrace behind apodium in fashionable Roman manner …3 [part0120.html#chapter13-3]I understand Lohmann’s logic but I have a number of problems with it. First andforemost there is the very concept of a “podium” that is being bandied aroundhere. The dictionary defines “podium” as:the masonry supporting a classical temple.4 [part0120.html#chapter13-4]Or, alternatively:a stereobate for a classical temple, especially one with perpendicular sides.5[part0120.html#chapter13-5]A “stereobate” in turn is defined as:the foundation or base upon which a building or the like is erected.6[part0120.html#chapter13-6]Or, alternatively:the solid foundation forming the floor and substructure of a classical temple;crepidoma; podium.7 [part0120.html#chapter13-7]A “crepidoma,” likewise, is “the platform on which the superstructure of thebuilding is erected.”8 [part0120.html#chapter13-8]What all these definitions hold in common is the notion that a podium is astructure on top of which a temple is built. But this is not the case withLohmann’s Podium 2. It is not the “foundation or base” upon which the Temple ofJupiter is erected, it is not the “solid foundation forming the floor” of theTemple of Jupiter, and it is not “the masonry supporting” the Temple of Jupiter.What the Temple of Jupiter in fact stands on, and is “supported” by, as Lohmannhimself makes clear, is the Herodian Podium 1. Lohmann’s Podium 2, it turns out,does not “support” any part of the Temple of Jupiter. It surrounds Podium 1 onthree sides but it does not support it. It is, in other words, as I described itseveral times in Chapter Twelve, a U-shaped megalithic wall; but it is not apodium. If the Romans built it, as Lohmann believes, then they did not build itto serve any structural, load-bearing, podium-like purposes but purely forcosmetic reasons—“as an attempt,” to repeat his own words, “to hide the older,inconveniently shaped temple terrace behind a podium in fashionable Romanmanner.”In response I can only repeat that “podium” continues to be a misleading term,which does not describe what we actually see on the ground. If Lohmann’sanalysis of the pre-existing Herodian works is right, then we don’t see evidenceof the Romans hiding “the older, inconveniently shaped temple terrace” behind afashionable Roman “podium.” Whatever plans they may have had for extension anddevelopment, which we cannot know and which there are no records of whatsoever,the evidence on the ground is limited to that massive U-shaped enclosure wallsurrounding Podium 1 on three sides but not supporting it—a profoundlymegalithic wall, larger in every dimension than any other that the Romans areknown to have built anywhere in the world.A wall that doesn’t even look Roman, incorporating blocks weighing more than 800tons—the Trilithon—that would have required truly spectacular efforts to moveand put into place.I’m not saying that the Romans weren’t equal to such efforts, or that 800-tonblocks were beyond the limits of their building technology. I don’t know, anddon’t claim to know, the limits of their technology. What I’m saying is that itis quite unlike the practical, phlegmatic cast of mind of the Romans, whichLohmann recognizes,9 [part0120.html#chapter13-9] to go to such extreme lengthsfor purely cosmetic purposes. Surely, therefore, there is room to consider analternative possibility, namely that the megalithic U-shaped wall was already inplace long before—perhaps even thousands of years before—Podium 1 was built?But in the very paper in which Kalayan asserts that the Trilithon predates theTemple of Jupiter he goes on to give another crucial piece of information thatseems to pour cold water on speculation of this sort. Yes, the Trilithon isolder than the superstructure of the Temple of Jupiter, but not much older,because:A part of a drum of a column similar in dimension to the columns of the Templeof Jupiter is used as a block in the foundation under the Trilithon. In theabsence (to our knowledge) of a second monument with similar dimensions ofcolumns in Baalbek, one can conclude that the drum was a discarded one and thatthe columns were already cut, or were in process of shaping when the foundationsof the Trilithon had started.10 [part0120.html#chapter13-10]Is this the “ugly little fact that destroys a beautiful theory?” Is my quest fora lost civilization at Baalbek fatally compromised by Kalayan’s column drum?Might I just as well pack up and go home? You would think so from the skepticalliterature on this subject, which endlessly regurgitates the paragraph quotedabove as though it settles the matter once and for all, as though it provesbeyond reasonable doubt that the Trilithon is the work of the Romans—as thoughany further thought and questioning on the matter is spurious, pseudo-scientifichogwash.Skeptical author and self-styled “debunker of fringe science and revisionisthistory” Jason Colavito, for example, claims that “archaeology and engineeringcan explain all the individual aspects of the Trilithon” and that there istherefore no need for an alternative perspective.11 [part0120.html#chapter13-11]Rather than do the work to back up this assertion himself, however, he refers usto the “wonderful” writings of another self-styled “skeptic,” physicist AaronAdair.12 [part0120.html#chapter13-12] Adair in turn simply rehashes Kalayan’sarguments, placing heavy reliance on the column drum in the foundations, and onthe architectural drawing on top of the southernmost Trilithon block, toconclude:we can be reasonably certain that the Trilithon stones were put into placecontemporaneously with the construction of the Temple of Jupiter. So already, byhaving the Trilithon stones contemporaneous with the temple we have establishedthe Roman provenance of the structure.13 [part0120.html#chapter13-13]It all sounds reasonable, wholesome and convincing. But actually, like so muchelse in the skeptical literature that is passed off as fact, it turns out, onclose scrutiny, to be speculation, opinion and bias masquerading as objectivity.That column drum, that Kalayan mentioned in passing, and that so many othershave relied upon absolutely to reinforce established ideas about the chronologyof the site, is much—much!—less than it seems.Ironically, the central problem that I’m coming to here is illustrated by Adairhimself in a black and white photograph of the western wall of the sanctuary(apparently taken from a very old postcard) that he reproduces with his articleto support his argument—namely that there are blocks below the Trilithon, andthat below these blocks, out of sight in the photo, is Kalayan’s column drum.But what the photograph shows in the wall above the Trilithon is a section of adifferent Roman column drum that was redeployed by the Arabs during one of themany occasions when we know they repaired fortress Baalbek, after it had beenattacked and pounded by enemy catapults.14 [part0120.html#chapter13-14]Moreover, as though to underline the impermanence of every redeployable featurein the walls of Baalbek, even that bit of column drum (which can also be seen ina photograph “taken before the First World War” and reproduced in 1980 byFriedrich Ragette15 [part0120.html#chapter13-15]) was removed in more recentrestorations—as Santha Faiia’s images from 2014 in the plates section show.Indeed the Arabs regularly and routinely cannibalized, reused and repurposedRoman column drums and parts of column drums.16 [part0120.html#chapter13-16]Moreover, as we saw in Chapter Twelve, and as Michael Alouf, a man who knew theruins intimately for more than fifty years, confirms, the foundations of Baalbekwere repeatedly undermined during the numerous sieges that the sanctuarysuffered while it served as a fortress.17 [part0120.html#chapter13-17] After thesieges the foundations were naturally repaired (otherwise whole sections of wallwould have collapsed) and it is my view that this, rather than original Romanconstruction, is the most plausible explanation for the column drum found in thefoundations beneath the Trilithon. Why, after all, if the Romans made thesefoundations, as the orthodox theory requires us to accept, would they havesuddenly used a column drum at this point, when they would surely have hadplenty of regular blocks, specifically cut and dressed for the purpose, at theirdisposal?It simply doesn’t make sense. But Arab masons repairing an undermined foundationwould have used whatever lay at hand and the centuries of warfare, earthquakesand other disasters that Baalbek suffered meant that there were enormousquantities of broken columns lying around, as there still are to this day. Thereis also another possibility, which is that the Romans did, in fact, put thecolumn drum into the wall—but again as a repair, rather than as an act oforiginal construction. If the megalithic wall was already very ancient when theRomans came on the scene, and if it was their intention to use it as a base forfurther construction, they would undoubtedly have surveyed the foundations andrepaired any sectors that the years had not been kind to.I scrawl “FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THAT COLUMN DRUM” across a page of my notebook.The matter isn’t closed yet—one way or the other—but the hypothesis that theRomans were not the original builders of the U-shaped megalithic wall of whichthe Trilithon is an integral part, continues to look viable to me, and worthy offurther investigation.It’s time to see the Trilithon from the outside. I leave my welcome patch ofshade, poke around a little longer on the top of the giant blocks and thenretrace my steps eastward through the Temple of Jupiter complex. Eventually—it’sa long walk—I find my way back to the main entrance of the site, pass throughthe propylea and down the main stairs, turn right and follow the path that runsparallel to the southern exterior wall of the fortress the Arabs made of thisplace. The Temple of Venus comes into view a few hundred yards southeast of themain ruins. It’s beautiful, but irrelevant to my purposes, so I ignore it andpress on toward the southwest, passing two more Arab towers built into thefortification walls and eventually coming to a gateway in the fence throughwhich I can see the Trilithon in the distance.image [../images/00047.jpeg]Figure 44A guard is there. He makes a great show of keeping me out, but money changeshands, the gate is opened with a flourish, and I’m on my way through an orchardof shriveled trees to get a better look at the three largest blocks ever used inany construction anywhere in the world …“The highest pinnacle of power and science…”In the nineteenth century David Urquhart, a learned Scotsman, traveled widely inLebanon, eventually publishing his History and Diary in 1860. He never explainedwhere he got the hint from, but it was his belief that Baalbek had played animportant part in the secretive maritime empire of the Phoenicians, whoseexploits started to be remarked upon by other cultures in the second milleniumBC and who were descended from the original Canaanite people of this region.Indeed the Phoenicians usually referred to themselves as Canaanites.18[part0120.html#chapter13-18] Renowned for their seafaring abilities, andespecially for their uncanny—or perhaps one should say instead, precise andscientific—navigational skills, they established ports all around the coasts ofthe Mediterranean as far afield as Tunisia, Morocco, Spain, Italy, Turkey,Cyprus and Malta. Their heartland was in Lebanon, however, and their first citywas Byblos, to the north of modern Beirut, with other important centers at Tireand Sidon.There is much that is mysterious about the Phoenicians, and they have often beenreproached by frustrated researchers “for having been so persistently silentabout themselves and for having left no written history of their own. Everythingwe know about them comes from the annals of other races; they have only foreignadvocates to plead their cause to posterity.”19 [part0120.html#chapter13-19]One of those foreign advocates was the Greek scholar Philo, who lived in Byblosin the first and second centuries AD—hence he is known as Philo of Byblos. HisPhoenician History purported to be a translation of a book written by oneSanchuniathon, a Phoenician sage who had supposedly lived more than a thousandyears earlier.20 [part0120.html#chapter13-20] Sanchuniathon’s writings have notcome down to us in any other source. Moreover, like the works of the Babylonianpriest Berossos, whom the reader will recall from earlier chapters, Philo’s ownPhoenician History has also been lost. All that is left of it are fragmentspreserved as quotations and summaries by other authors—notably the fourthcentury Church Father Eusebius.21 [part0120.html#chapter13-21]In these fragments we read of the exploits of a “god” identified with the Greekdeity Ouranos, whose name means “sky” or “heaven” and who:invented betyls by devising stones endowed with life.22[part0120.html#chapter13-22]There are a couple of points of interest here. First of all, obviously, we areback in the realm of betyls, those meteoritic “stones fallen from heaven” thatare so often part of the debris stream of fragmenting comets and that weretreated as cult objects throughout the ancient Near East. If we look into theetymology of the word betyl we find that it means “home of the god,”23[part0120.html#chapter13-23] and the home of Ouranos is, of course, the sky, theright place for objects of meteoritic origin. Secondly, there is this curiousreference to “stones endowed with life” which, significantly, is given in sometranslations as “stones that moved as having life.”24[part0120.html#chapter13-24] In this I couldn’t help but be reminded oftraditions from Ancient Egypt that spoke of huge stones being effortlessly movedaround by “magicians” using “words of power.” For example, there is an accountpreserved on British Museum Papyrus No. 604 of the deeds of the magician Horusthe Nubian, who:made a vault of stone 200 cubits [300 feet] long and 50 cubits [75 feet] widerise above the head of Pharaoh and his nobles … When Pharaoh looked up at thesky he opened his mouth in a great cry, together with the people who were in thecourt.25 [part0120.html#chapter13-25]Since 200 cubits by 50 cubits equates to approximately 100 meters by 25 meters(328 feet by 82 feet) it is obvious that any magician who could raise such amassive block would have no difficulty raising the megaliths of the Trilithon,which are less than a quarter of that size. At any rate, this thought of themagicians of the gods brings us back, by a circuitous route, to David Urquhartwho tells us in his History and Diary what it was that led him to Baalbek in themid-nineteenth century:I was drawn thither by the Betylia [i.e. betyls], that mystery of the ancientwriters … which I [believe] to have been Magnets used in the Phoenician vesselsengaged in distant traffic, and which on the return of their fleets wereconveyed in religious procession to the temple at Baalbek, to remain there untilthe fleets were again sent forth …26 [part0120.html#chapter13-26]Unfortunately Urquhart found no hints of the lost technology, “the magical,magnetic stones”27 [part0120.html#chapter13-27] he was looking for in Baalbek.“Where is the temple that held the Betylia?” he asked. “It has disappeared.” Hededuced that “it must have stood upon the platform and was probably pulleddown,” to make way for the Roman temples.28 [part0120.html#chapter13-28] Hetherefore contented himself with an inquiry into the mysteries of the Trilithonand of an even larger cut-stone block that his local informants showed him lyingabandoned in the quarry half a mile to the south of the ruins. These ruins, henoted, when you imagined them without the later temples “now stuck on the top,”were “nothing but a quadrangular enclosure”:29 [part0120.html#chapter13-29]One can conceive the hewing out of enormous blocks for the statue of a king, theornament of a palace, or the pomp of a temple, but here there is no such object;there is no conceivable object by which such an effort can be explained.30[part0120.html#chapter13-30]This was one of a series of questions to which Urquhart could propose no answersof his own: first, why build with such huge blocks (beside which “Stonehenge isa nursery toy”); second, why build here, since Baalbek was not a great capitalor a great port, but stood far inland; third, why was the work suddenly stopped,as evidenced by the block in the quarry and by the unfinished state of theU-shaped wall in which the Trilithon is set; and fourth, why was Baalbekunique?31 [part0120.html#chapter13-31]This structure is alone; there is nothing upon earth in the remotest degreeresembling it.32 [part0120.html#chapter13-32]That night Urquhart dined with the Emir of Baalbek and asked him whom the hugeU-shaped enclosure had been built by. The Emir replied in rather matter-of-facttones that there had been three phases of construction. The megalithic work hadbeen done at the command of two different rulers in the primeval period beforethe Flood:And then came the Deluge. After that it was repaired by Solomon.33[part0120.html#chapter13-33]When he was on his way back to Beirut, Urquhart reflected on what the Emir hadtold him, concluding that it touched on a fundamental truth and that “the stonesof Baalbek had to be considered as some of those sturdy fellows who the Delugecould not sweep away.”34 [part0120.html#chapter13-34] More than that, it seemedto him that:Before the Deluge the whole course of human society had been run … The buildersof Baalbek must have been a people who had attained to the highest pinnacle ofpower and science; and this region must have been the center of their domain.35[part0120.html#chapter13-35]Noah, after all, had mastered the science to build the Ark:A vessel 450 feet long, 75 broad, and 45 deep … He therefore shared in theknowledge of these men of renown, and navigation must have attained in theseantediluvian times to an extra-ordinary degree of perfection. For the buildingof the Ark we have only the authority of the Bible … The skeptic, on the otherhand, who visits Baalbek, will cease to doubt that the men who could build intoits walls stones of the weight of a three-decker with its guns on board, couldconstruct a vessel of [such immense] dimensions. I assume that the Antediluvianorigin of the one can no more be contested by the critic than that of the otherby the believer. 36 [part0120.html#chapter13-36]Today, and rightly so, skeptics question everything that smacks of creduloussuperstition and easy belief. The traditions that so excited Urqhuart, however,are pervasive. Noah himself is said to be buried in the area, having returnedthere after the Flood to live out the remainder of his days.37[part0120.html#chapter13-37] And according to Estfan El Douaihy, MaronitePatriarch of Lebanon from 1670 to 1704:Baalbek is the most ancient building in the world … It was … peopled with giantswho were punished for their iniquities by the Flood.38[part0120.html#chapter13-38]Other traditions implicate demons in the placing of the megaliths,39[part0120.html#chapter13-39] and an Arabic manuscript echoes the story Urquhartwas told about an attempt to rebuild Baalbek after the Flood. In this account itwas not Solomon but Nimrod, the great grandson of Noah, who sent giants torepair the damaged walls.40 [part0120.html#chapter13-40]Demons, giants, rollers, capstans, cranes … or aliens?Looking up at the three massive blocks of the Trilithon, their bases more than 6meters (20 feet) above ground level in Baalbek’s western wall, I can understandwhy they were believed to be the work of demons or giants. There is, indeed,something supernatural—something seemingly impossible—about them. Their lengthsare respectively 19.60 meters (64 feet 3 inches), 19.30 meters (63 feet 3inches) and 19.10 meters (62 feet 8 inches) and they’re all 4.34 meters (14 feet3 inches) high and 3.65 meters (just a shade under 12 feet) wide.41[part0120.html#chapter13-41] They are fitted in place so precisely that it isimpossible to insert even the edge of a razor blade into the joints.“Go figure” is all I can say!But if you want the orthodox take on the subject read Jean-Pierre Adam’s 1977paper, A propos du trilithon de Baalbek: Le transport et la mise en oeuvre desmegaliths.42 [part0120.html#chapter13-42] It’s still the standard work ofreference cited by all skeptics as though it proves their case, and it sets outa proposal deploying rollers of cedar wood, on which we are to envisage theblocks being placed.43 [part0120.html#chapter13-43] To pull the blocks over therollers Adam first considers, then (for logistical reasons) rejects, the use ofa herd of 800 oxen.44 [part0120.html#chapter13-44]Finally, reasoning that weakness of human muscle power can be overcome bytechnical ingenuity, he settles on multiple arrays of pulleys rigged up to sixcapstans, each worked by a team of 24 men making a total of just 144 men totransport the blocks of the Trilithon, one by one, from the quarry half a mile(800 meters away) to the construction site.45 [part0120.html#chapter13-45] Atthe end of the journey, he calculates that 16 larger capstans, each worked by ateam of 32 men (i.e. 512 men in total) would have been required to maneuver theblocks into their final position.46 [part0120.html#chapter13-46] The reason forthe increased number of capstans and men at the end of the operation is that thewooden rollers would have to be removed, since obviously they could not be leftin place in the wall. This would greatly increase the friction between the blockand the surface over which it had to be dragged, but the deployment of some kindof lubricant would theoretically reduce the friction enough to avoid any need tolift the blocks—a problem that Adam believes the Romans would have preferred notto confront with blocks of this size.47 [part0120.html#chapter13-47]Friedrich Ragette has a slightly different orthodox solution to the challenge ofmoving and placing the megaliths of the Trilithon.48[part0120.html#chapter13-48] In his case it does involve lifting the blocks atthe end of the procedure, which he suggests would have been done using multiple“Lewis” devices (metal pieces fitted into specially cut holes in the stonesabove their center of mass, attached to chains or ropes and lifted by cranes orwinches):The 800-ton block of the Trilithon must have been moved into position byrollers. Then it had to be lifted slightly to allow the removal of the rollersbefore the tremendous load was lowered inch by inch. If we figure five tonslifting capacity per Lewis hole we would need 160 attachments to the stone.49[part0120.html#chapter13-49]It is not my intention to offer a detailed critique here. I simply note inpassing that there are some difficulties with Adam’s and Ragette’s proposals.Both, for example, rely on wooden rollers but calculations indicate that thestress of supporting the huge blocks would very quickly have crushed suchrollers, even if they were cut from the strongest Lebanon cedar.50[part0120.html#chapter13-50] Likewise, capstans are all very well and certainlymultiply the “muscle power” that each man is able to exert, but there is adanger, which Adam recognizes, that unless massively anchored to the ground, itwould be the capstans rather than the blocks that moved.51[part0120.html#chapter13-51] Finally, every mason understands the principle ofLewis devices and how they work, but there is no sign on the Trilithon blocks ofeven a single Lewis hole, let alone of 160 on each of them.52[part0120.html#chapter13-52]Both Adam and Ragette, and others who want to reassure us how unremarkable andunmysterious the whole achievement of the Trilithon is, like to preface theiraccounts with reference to large megaliths that were moved using knowntechnologies in historical times. For example a 25 meter (82 feet) tall Egyptianobelisk, weighing 320 tons, was brought to Rome in the first century AD by theEmperor Caligula. Transporting it from Egypt and across the Mediterranean in aspecially built ship was, itself, an incredible feat of engineering, logisticsand heavy lifting. Then, much later—in the sixteenth century—the same obeliskwas moved from where it had stood since Caligula’s time and re-erected in St.Peter’s Square on the orders of Pope Sixtus V.53 [part0120.html#chapter13-53]Likewise in Russia in the late eighteenth century the “Thunderstone,” a1,250-ton block of granite, the base for an equestrian statue of Peter the Greatthat still stands in the city of Saint Petersburg, was hauled seven kilometers(4.3 miles) overland on a special moveable track of bronze spheres.54[part0120.html#chapter13-54]Mind you, it’s one thing to drag a supersized megalith in a straight line overbronze ball-bearings, or to stand one up in the middle of a huge empty square,but it’s quite another to build a series of such megaliths into a wall thatlooks like a titan’s Lego project.Still … let’s accept that it can be done, that similar things have been done,and of course—for the evidence is before our eyes—that it was done at Baalbek.The only question that matters, therefore, is whether it was the Romans who didit, or whether they, and the cultures that preceded them here going back 10,000years or more, found the U-shaped megalithic wall already in place and fittedtheir own structures into its embrace.That’s what it looks like to me.The solid foundation rising above the plain at Baalbek that Daniel Lohmannidentifies as pre-Roman and calls Podium 1, and on top of which the Temple ofJupiter was built, sits nicely inside the U-shaped wall which embraces it on itssouth, west and northern sides. At no point does the wall support the Temple ofJupiter. It is an entirely separate, exterior, structure.I walk several times along the western wall, gazing up in stupefaction at theawesome megaliths of the Trilithon, trying to get to grips with what they mean.Regardless of whether it was the Romans or some unknown, antediluvian culturewho put them here, what I’d like to know is why they put them 20 feet up? Whydid they stack them on top of courses of smaller blocks, when surely the logicwould have been to put the largest, heaviest blocks at ground level and add thesmaller, lighter blocks above them. Why create the huge additional engineeringand lifting challenge of doing it the other way round?I walk along the wall. I’m counting blocks and courses. First of all, workingupward from ground level, there are three courses of really quite small—let’ssay 1.5 meters (about 5 feet) high, quarter ton—ashlars. On top of these are sixmuch bigger blocks, very nicely finished (although also very heavily eroded)with the upper half trimmed in to be narrower than the base. These six blocks,which are more or less identical to blocks in the south wall that I describedearlier (see Chapter Twelve), weigh about 400 tons each. Finally on top of them,come the three monster, 800-ton, blocks of the Trilithon.I walk north now, to the corner of the west and the north walls. Thenorthernmost block of the Trilithon doesn’t extend right to the end of the westwall. There’s a gap, filled up by an Arab defensive tower extending out fromPodium 1 and built over the corner. But if I remove that tower in my mind’s eye,then I can see what’s going on, because on the other side of it is another hugerow of megaliths forming the northern arm of the “U”-shaped wall—the row thatI’d looked down on earlier from above (see Chapter Twelve); indeed the Arabdefensive tower was the very one I stepped out on to get a proper view of thispart of the megalithic wall, which is separated by a grassy gap 35 feet widefrom the north wall of Podium 1.I know archaeologists see the U-shaped wall as the base of the Temple ofJupiter’s grandiose but unfinished Podium 2. Lohmann makes a very good case forit being exactly that. But I’m still bothered by its non-load-bearing, purelycosmetic function, if that’s the case, and I can’t shake the feeling that it wasa feature the Romans inherited from a much earlier time.Where I do agree with the archaeologists, however, is that the even largermegaliths that I know are still in the quarry half a mile away, and that I’mgoing to take a look at as soon as I’m finished here, were definitely intendedto sit on the top of the northern and southern arms of the U-shaped wall, thusraising them to the height that the western wall attained with the placement ofthe Trilithon. True, they are a bit longer and wider than the Trilithon blocks,but after trimming off the “boss” left to protect them on their journey from thequarry they would match exactly, fitting like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.This remains the case, whether the Romans made the U-shaped wall as part ofPodium 2 or whether it was the work of the architects and masons of a lostcivilization of prehistoric antiquity.And there’s something else I agree with the archaeologists on.Ideas put into circulation decades ago by “ancient astronaut” enthusiasts,notably Zecharia Sitchin in his book Stairway to Heaven, first published in 1980(and in other later volumes of his Earth Chronicles series), cannot possibly beright. Whatever Baalbek is, and for whatever reason megaliths of 800 tons andmore were used here, and whoever it was who put those megaliths in place, theydefinitely did not do so in order to create “a landing place for the aircraft ofthe gods.”55 [part0120.html#chapter13-55] Sitchin’s claim that the raisedplatform of Baalbek was “intended to support some extremely heavy weight” andthat the heavy weight in question was a “rocket-like Flying Chamber,”56[part0120.html#chapter13-56] could only have been made by a man who had no ideaof the real appearance and layout of Baalbek itself, and could only be believedby others with no direct knowledge of the site.The giant megalithic blocks of the Trilithon that seem to have convinced Sitchinthe entire platform of Baalbek was megalithic all turn out to be parts of theU-shaped wall that embraces the (only modestly sized) Podium 1. And while analien might conceivably land his spacecraft on even so modest a podium (if therewere no other structure there) he certainly would not want to land it on top ofa wall. It follows, therefore, that to use the megalithic character of theU-shaped wall to claim that a podium—which it is not even connected to, and doesnot support—was an alien “landing platform,” designed to bear extremely heavyweights, where “all landings and take offs of the Shuttlecraft had to beconducted”57 [part0120.html#chapter13-57] is either ignorant, or disingenuous orboth.Besides, even if the whole of the Baalbek complex was megalithic—which is not atall the case—we must ask ourselves why technologically advanced aliens capableof crossing the solar system in their spaceships would need such a platform toland on in the first place? If they could hop from planet to planet as Sitchinasks us to believe, wouldn’t their science be up to constructing something alittle more high-tech and fit for purpose than that? In short, isn’t it obviousthat Sitchin simply took 1970s NASA space technology as his template andprojected it onto his imagined ancient astronauts?I knew Zecharia Sitchin personally, had a few dinners with him in New York andonce drove him from Stonehenge to London when he was on a visit to England. Iliked him well enough, and I think he did some good research, but on Baalbek atleast I have no doubt now—after exploring the site myself—that his whole“landing platform” thesis is fundamentally flawed. This is not to say, however,that every idea set out in his books was equally compromised. The Mesopotamiancuneiform texts, which he could not read and translate as he claimed (his“translations” were adapted and to some extent “fictionalized” from the work ofmainstream scholars) do in fact contain material of the greatest interest, and Ithink he was right to notice hints of high technology in them.But were those technologies “alien” or human? This is a question we’ll return toin Chapter Sixteen, when we’ll consider what is known about certain powerfulbeings referred to in Biblical and other ancient texts as “the Nephilim” and“the Watchers.”The biggest cut stone block in the world“I have found that archaeologists are seldom receptive to the notion of ancientastronauts,” wrote Elif Batuman in an article about Baalbek in the New Yorker onDecember 18, 2014, “although one could argue that, when the archaeologists wentlooking for answers, all they managed to find was an even bigger and moremysterious block.”58 [part0120.html#chapter13-58]Indeed so! In June 2014, just a month before I arrived in Baalbek, the GermanArchaeological Institute made a stunning discovery in the quarries half a milesouth of the Temple of Jupiter. There, it had long been known, lay two giantmegaliths that are heavier, by a significant margin, than any of the stones inthe Trilithon. What no one had suspected, however, despite a century of ratherintensive investigations around Baalbek, was that a third immense block layburied and hidden from view under the sediment that has accumulated in thequarry over the millennia. The archaeologists chose not to announce theirdiscovery to the world until late November 2014, but since they had excavated itin June, it lay there in full view when I first visited the quarry on July 10and a local shopkeeper—who claimed that the discovery was in fact his and thatthe Germans had merely appropriated it—made a point of drawing it to myattention.The quarry is in two parts, divided by a road, and in the first area you come toas you approach from the direction of the temples lies the famous “Stone of thePregnant Woman,” also known as the “Stone of the South,” which has beendecorating postcards from Baalbek for a hundred years and was known to travelerslike David Urquhart long before that. It measures 21.5 meters (almost 71 feet)in length, 4.2 meters (just under 14 feet) in height, and 4.3 meters (just over14 feet) in width. It weighs 970 tons.59 [part0120.html#chapter13-59] Across theroad a second even bigger megalith, which had lain undiscovered since timeimmemorial, was unearthed in the 1990s. It measures 20.5 meters (just over 67feet) in length, 4.56 meters wide (almost 15 feet) and 4.5 (14 feet 9 inches)meters high; its weight has been calculated to be 1,242 tons.60[part0120.html#chapter13-60] But the megalith that was discovered in June 2014has a mass greater than either of these, measuring 19.6 meters (64 feet 4inches) long, 6 meters (19 feet 9 inches) wide, and 5.5 meters (18 feet) high,with an estimated weight of 1,650 tons.61 [part0120.html#chapter13-61]It was this newly excavated megalith, the single largest block of stone everquarried in the ancient world, that the excited shopkeeper proudly pointed outto me during my visit. Its upper surface is less than two meters (6 feet 7inches) below the lower edge of the Stone of the Pregnant Woman, which it liesimmediately beside and parallel to. And, like the Stone of the Pregnant Woman,it is beautifully cut and shaped, ready, after removal of the “boss,” to gostraight into the U-shaped wall for which all three giant blocks wereundoubtedly intended.I spend some hours clambering around these weird, otherworldly blocks. I feel asthough I’m mountaineering. The scale is so immense, and in a way so “alien,”that a curious detachment from everyday reality sets in and I lose all track oftime. I note that the Stone of the Pregnant Woman appears to have been slicedthrough at the base, where it emerges from the bedrock, with a clean straightcut. How was that done? And no matter where I stand—above, below, beside—I amdwarfed by this monstrous product of ancient and unknowable minds. The verythought that someone, in some distant epoch, could conceive of this, could cutit out and shape it entire and then, at the end, just leave it here, abandon it,forget about it, is incomprehensible to me. The closer I examine it, the moredetails I observe of the precision of the workmanship, of the scale of theenterprise, and of the will and imagination that went into its creation, themore certain I become that it and its fellows here in the quarries, and theTrilithon, and the other giant megaliths of Baalbek, were not the work of theRomans.I know how profoundly Daniel Lohmann disagrees! A few months later, in February2015, he and I will correspond at some length over several days. He willgraciously answer many questions and help me to understand some of thecomplexities of Baalbek that escaped me when I was there. He’ll make anexcellent case for the Roman provenance of the whole vast scheme. He will evensend me a photograph of the column drum built into the foundations of theTrilithon wall and he’ll write:In my recent work I located this column drum fragment, excavated it anew, andmeasured it millimeter precise to determine the drum diameter. I looked at thesurface structure and masons dressing in comparison with the Jupiter templecolumns and the lithology. All indications are exactly the same as the columndrums of the Roman Jupiter temple. The fragment was neatly dressed at the edgesto make a masonry ashlar out of it, and it received the beautifully sharply cutedges that all ashlars of the Roman Jupiter Temple phase have (including themegaliths).62 [part0120.html#chapter13-62]My reply:First of all, to be absolutely clear, I don’t dispute that this fragment is froma column drum of the Roman Jupiter Temple. Clearly it is. And I don’t disputethe generally agreed dating of the columns of the Roman Jupiter Temple. But thisfragment is a very important part of the (formidable!) edifice of logic you andyour colleagues use to establish the chronology of the Trilithon, and that manyothers have relied upon when reporting that chronology. What I’d like tointerrogate a little further, therefore, is your level of certainty that thiscolumn drum fragment was put there at the same time as the original constructionof the western wall. It’s nicely cut and shaped, I agree, but still it sticksout like a sore thumb (especially now I see it cleared in the photo you kindlysent me). It looks intrusive, odd and awkward—very different from the rest ofthe blocks in this course. In short I think the argument can be made that it ismore likely to be a later repair of the wall than it is to be an integral partof the original wall. Lending some support to this argument is that we know theArabs were constantly repairing the walls around the whole site, and sometimesusing column drums to do so, so why shouldn’t this be just one more of thoserepairs? What is the absolutely compelling archaeological evidence thatcompletely, effectively and once and for all rules this possibility out? I’d bemost grateful if you could address that specific point in your reply.63[part0120.html#chapter13-63]Lohmann comes right back at me on this:The fragment is just one of the indications that shows the synchronicity of themegalith podium and the temple, which was not our result, but known to sciencefor over one hundred years—and at latest since the excavations by the Germanteam of 1900–1904. Yes, it sticks out. But no—not unlike the others. Thebuilders of the temple were rather pragmatic: once the structure was to behidden underneath the soil or behind something else, they didn’t bother toflatten the surfaces or make it look nice … What was important first whenbuilding is that the ashlar was perfectly flattened on the top and bottom, andthen the two sides, in order to create a solid and stable wall—and that was doneon the column drum exactly in the same Roman manner as it was done on the blocksaround it. If you look at the length of the fragment, and imagine a hole in thewall instead, the two smaller ashlars in the course above would fall, causingfurther instability for the structures above. Here, frictional connection/forceclosure (translations of kraftschluss from my dictionary—language barriers!) isneeded, you can’t just replace an ashlar in a row of “stretchers.” Secondly,Arab repairs of Roman walls look a lot different: they used smaller blocksinstead, and would never have been able to squeeze a block in so tightly …Medieval repairs never have such tight joints. It’s a comparison of precisionthat makes an engineer like me 100% certain.64 [part0120.html#chapter13-64]After examining our own photographs of the Trilithon wall—Santha took a greatmany while we were there—I find myself unpersuaded by Lohmann’s argument. Firstof all (see Plate 40), this column drum is not “hidden underneath soil or behindsomething else.” It’s in plain view in the lowest visible course of the wall,and it does stick out like a sore thumb. It’s made of a distinctively different,much darker, stone and it has a very different “look” from any neighboringblock. It is quite unique in fact. Secondly, as to the precision, I don’t agreewith Lohmann that the column drum cannot be an Arab repair. In Plates 42 and 43the reader will find an example of another column drum which is certainly partof an Arab repair to the walls of Baalbek and its precision is as good as thaton the column drum in the foundations. Another possibility I’ve considered—thatit could be a Roman repair to a pre-Roman wall—also remains very much in play.If the lower block which this improvised block replaced had been badly damaged,and a decision had been made to remove it, the two small rectangular blocksabove it (the ones Lohmann said “would fall, causing further instability for thestructures above”) would have had to be removed at the same time.But the next course up is so set that none of the other blocks in it would havefallen, nor would any instability have been caused to the huge megalith in thecourse above that, which is supported on no less than five large horizontalblocks, three of which would be entirely unaffected by the removal of the twosmaller blocks below, while the other two would have been held in place by“frictional connection.” Once the column drum had been cut to shape and put inplace at ground level, the two smaller blocks could have been slid back into thewall above it, completing a very neat and effective repair.There’s something else, a fundamental area of disagreement, concerning what Isee as a U-shaped megalithic wall surrounding Podium 1, but that Lohmann sees asthe first courses of Podium 2. He tells me that “aside from the size of theashlars” what I call a U-shaped megalithic wall is “the bottom of a standardshape of a Roman temple podium after Augustus times.” He asks me to take a lookat the podium of the Maison Carée in Nimes,65 [part0120.html#chapter13-65] andsuggests that the Temple of Bacchus in Baalbek itself also has a similarpodium.66 [part0120.html#chapter13-66] He sends me links to photographs. “If youzoom in,” he writes, “you can see the stones of the second layer above thebottom layer, corresponding to the Trilithon.”My reply:You write that the megalithic podium for the Temple of Jupiter, though obviouslyon a very different scale, is the “standard shape of a Roman temple podium” butI’m not sure I see that from the pix you linked to. I attach here one of oursfrom the Temple of Bacchus … (same angle as the one you sent67[part0120.html#chapter13-67]). It shows a podium with a single straight side(apart from the lip at top and bottom), whereas the podium of the Temple ofJupiter gives more of a stepped effect with the row of huge megalithic blocks,that according to our correspondence form part of the lowest layer of theJulio-Claudian Temple podium, stepped out very far from the sheer wall abovethem, on top of which stood the peristasis. I suppose the resemblance would bebetter if the megalithic layer had been completed and extended all the way up tothe top of the wall, but the peristasis would still have been set back a fewmeters from the top, instead of pretty much flush with the top as it is in theTemple of Bacchus. In short, when I zoom in to the Temple of Bacchus podium Idon’t really see blocks, regardless of scale, that correspond with the Trilithonblocks. Am I missing something obvious here?68 [part0120.html#chapter13-68]I also ask: “Have you found organic materials with good provenance anywhere in‘Podium 2’ and have you done carbon dating on these?”69[part0120.html#chapter13-69]On the carbon dating Lohmann replies that “unfortunately” none had been done:The history of constant change in the building, as well as deep excavationlevels of the past 100 years have left no archaeological or organic material atall that would help us with this.70 [part0120.html#chapter13-70]In its own way this is quite a revelation to me, since it means—to deploy anappropriate metaphor—that the entire edifice of archaeological chronology forthe so-called “Julio-Claudian podium”—Podium 2—of the Temple of Jupiter, restson foundations in which there is no scientific dating evidence whatsoever. Thisis not to say that radiocarbon dates for archaeological sites are unproblematic!As we’ve seen in earlier chapters, they are often very problematic indeed—unlessit can be demonstrated, as is the case at Göbekli Tepe, that the dated organicremains have been “sealed” at a particular moment and there is no possibility ofsubsequent intrusion of later materials that might give a falsely young date.But there are simply no carbon dates, problematic or not, for Podium 2. Itfollows, therefore, that the orthodox chronology of this incredibly interestingand peculiar structure is based entirely on stylistic factors—that certainstyles of building can be associated with specific cultures and specific periodsand that the “style” seen in Podium 2 is entirely appropriate to the“Julio-Claudian” epoch of Roman construction.It’s my view that the stylistic argument at Baalbek is nowhere near as clear-cutas it should be, given how much of our understanding of the site depends on it.And in response to my question about the positioning of the peristasis (i.e. ofthe four-sided porch or hall of columns surrounding the cella—the innerbuilding—of the temple), Lohmann admits there is a stylistic anomaly:yes, normally the peristasis would rest on the edge of the podium, as it does atthe Bacchus temple. That would be following the Roman examples. (Mars-Ultor atthe Roman Forum was a milestone building for that71[part0120.html#chapter13-71]). It is one of the oddities of Jupiter.72[part0120.html#chapter13-72]On the other hand, Lohmann points out, temples do exist where the peristasis isset back in the way he envisages it would ultimately have been at Baalbek ifPodium 2 had ever been completed—for example, the Bel temple in Palmyra, thetemple of Zeus in Aizanoi, Turkey, and the colossal temple in Tarsos, Turkey.“In my opinion,” he writes:this is due to the fact that both Bel temple, and Jupiter in Baalbek, were builtonto older podia (Herodian in Baalbek, Hellenistic in Palmyra), and had to finda solution how to squeeze a first-century, latest-fashion Roman podiumunderneath the (even only slightly) older temple building. Baalbek’s terrace wasimmensely high, so the podium needed to be colossal, and in Palmyra theperistasis was already standing, so the podium was erected at a distance.73[part0120.html#chapter13-73]Further, Lohmann stands his ground on the issue of the shape of Podium 2 which,despite its incompleteness, he sees as being quite normal:a standard podium consists of a bottom profile (lip, as you call it), the“shaft” or the vertical part (that’s the trilithon layer in Baalbek…) and a toplip layer …74 [part0120.html#chapter13-74]He attaches an architectural diagram of the podium of Hosn Niha, another Romantemple in Lebanon, to make his point.75 [part0120.html#chapter13-75] To my eye,however, it looks astonishingly unlike Podium 2 at Baalbek and the layer in itthat he wants me to compare to the Trilithon is just 1.58 meters (5 feet 3inches) high, whereas the Trilithon, as we’ve seen, is 4.34 meters (14 feet 3inches) high.As I’ve already noted, I think Daniel Lohmann makes a strong case, but nothingin our correspondence proves to me that the U-shaped megalithic wall (thatsurrounds, but that does not support, Podium 1 on which the Temple of Jupiter infact stands) is the work of the Romans. He could be right. But he could also bewrong and, in context of all the other indications from around the world of alost civilization, I think it wise to keep an open mind on Baalbek.Finally, however, it’s what I see in the quarry that convinces me of this,because we have to ask ourselves why three huge blocks in the range of 1,000 to1,650 tons were left there at all.The conventional answer is that the Romans, having quarried these exceptionallylarge blocks, found that they could not move them and simply abandoned them. Butthat explanation makes very little sense. If the argument that the Romans wereresponsible for the U-shaped megalithic wall is correct, then we know that theywent on to build an extensive temple complex dedicated to Jupiter using smallerblocks of stone. Surely their first source for the multiple smaller blocks theyneeded would have been the huge megaliths that, according to the argument ofmainstream archaeology, they had discovered they could not move from the quarry?The Romans were practical people, who would not allow work that they had alreadyso painstakingly done to go to waste. Rather than opening up fresh quarry faces,wouldn’t they have used those massive, already almost completely quarried1,000-ton-plus blocks and simply sliced them up into smaller, more moveablemegaliths for the construction of the rest of the temple?It’s really puzzling that they didn’t do so and therefore the fact that thesegigantic, almost finished blocks remain in the quarry, and were never sliced upinto smaller blocks and used in the general construction of the Temple ofJupiter, suggests to me very strongly that the Romans did not even know theywere there—just as the German Archaeological Institute, despite a hundred yearsof excavations, didn’t know until 2014 that a third massive block was there. Indue course, I’m told, “good new information about the dating and practicalitiesof the quarry megaliths” may be forthcoming, but that information was notavailable at the time of writing.76 [part0120.html#chapter13-76] I await it withinterest, but also with some doubt as to whether it will settle anything orsimply raise further questions.We are a species with amnesia. The devastating comet impacts that set theYounger Dryas in train 12,800 years ago and that caused two episodes of globalflooding, one at the beginning and one at the end of the Younger Dryas, made usforget so much. The recovery of memory from the fragments that remain islogistically difficult and psychologically painful—as the complexities anddecades of disputes around Baalbek show. But messages still reach us from thedeep and distant past in the words of the Sages, in the deeds of the magicians,and in the mighty memorials that they left behind to awaken us at the time ofthe Great Return."},{"pageContent":" Part VI [part0131.html#c_part6]Stars [part0131.html#c_part6]"},{"pageContent":" Chapter 14 [part0131.html#c_ch14]The Gates of the Sun [part0131.html#c_ch14]Baalbek remains very much on my mind the next day as we drive the magnificentcoastline around Jounieh Bay heading 38 kilometers (23.6 miles) north to Byblos,the ancient Phoenician port that claims, with some justification, to be theoldest continuously inhabited city in the world. Archaeologists have establishedthat it was occupied as early as 8800 BC,1 [part0121.html#chapter14-1] whileGöbekli Tepe still functioned.2 [part0121.html#chapter14-2] By 5000 BC, Bybloswas a flourishing, stable settlement that has never since been without humanpopulation.3 [part0121.html#chapter14-3] By 3000 BC, when it was known as Gublaor Gebel, it had grown to become the key port and city of the ancient Canaanitecoast.4 [part0121.html#chapter14-4] It was the Greeks who later called itByblos, when it served as the center of a lucrative papyrus trade with Egypt(bublos is the Greek word for papyrus).5 [part0121.html#chapter14-5] Likewisethe reader will recall from Chapter Thirteen that “Phoenician” was the Greekname for the Canaanites and that the Phoenicians referred to themselves asCanaanites. For simplicity’s sake, I will continue to use the terms “Phoenician”and “Canaanite” interchangeably here and continue to refer to ancientGubla/Gebel as Byblos.As we pull into Byblos with its street cafés and palms and the brightMediterranean lapping at its beautiful, crescent-shaped harbor, what’s on mymind about Baalbek is a question. Why didn’t the Romans choose to build thegreatest and most spectacular temple in their entire empire in Rome itself? Orfailing that, if for some reason they felt compelled to build the Temple ofJupiter in Lebanon, then why didn’t they build it in a prestigious and importantentrepôt like Byblos? And if not in Byblos, then why not in another of therenowned Phoenician ports along the same coast such as Tire or Sidon?Why Baalbek for the Temple of Jupiter? That’s the question. But there’s no easyanswer, because archaeologists and historians admit that not a single shred ofevidence exists “to tell us who commissioned, paid for, or designed any portionof the complex.”6 [part0121.html#chapter14-6] We can therefore only speculate asto their motives. It is really rather surprising when you consider the scale ofthe enterprise that no Emperor, no general and no architect ever claimed creditfor it, but the fact is that the temple remained peculiarly absent from theannals of the Romans and of all other peoples for many centuries after it wasbuilt.7 [part0121.html#chapter14-7]Not until Macrobius, who wrote in the fifth century AD (by which time Baalbekhad long been Christianized) do we even get a reference to the god who wasworshipped there.8 [part0121.html#chapter14-8] It is almost as though a spell ofsilence was cast over the place by the magicians of a former age and that theRomans fell under its glamor, allowing themselves to be bound by it, even asthey raised up the huge columns and pediments of their own temples. Inconsequence, as architectural historian Dell Upton observes, “ancient Baalbek isa figment of our imaginations.”9 [part0121.html#chapter14-9] Even the siteitself, as we see it now, is in a sense a work of fantasy, since so much of it:was reconstructed by a German archaeological mission in the early twentiethcentury and by French and Lebanese archaeologists in the 1930s, 1950s and 1960s.The rest we know from reconstruction drawings of the complex in a mythical stateof completion.10 [part0121.html#chapter14-10]It is a continuation of this archaeological “myth-making,” I believe, that leadsDaniel Lohmann to his paradoxical speculation that the builders of Roman Baalbekwere “megalomaniacs” even though they were, in fact, so self-effacing that theynever sought to associate themselves by name with any of the “giant stridestoward monumentality” that they took there.11 [part0121.html#chapter14-11] Themost gigantic of all these “megalomaniac” strides, of course, if Lohmann isright, was the unfinished attempt to give the Temple of Jupiter a purelycosmetic, non-load-bearing podium, rising—had it ever been completed—to around50 feet high (dwarfing any other Roman temple podium) and made up of blocksweighing hundreds of tons and, in the case of the Trilithon, close to a thousandtons. In Lohmann’s reference frame, and the reference frame of everyarchaeologist for the past century, only megalomaniacs would contemplate such atask.Since we’re all speculating, however, I offer the alternative speculation thatthe Romans chose Baalbek for the Temple of Jupiter—that it was such a specialplace to them—precisely because the U-shaped wall that Lohmann thinks was thebase of their “megalomaniac” podium was already there, coming down from the timeof the gods themselves and worthy of veneration in later ages purely in order tohonor those ancient gods, rather than to exalt the names and stoke the egos ofthose who honored them.Star worshippersOverlooking the ruins of Phoenician and Roman temples, a castle from theCrusader period (twelfth century AD) is the dominant landmark in Byblos today.And interestingly this Crusader castle, reconstructed and repaired many times,has at least a dozen Roman column drums re-used as masonry blocks in its walls—areminder that, in this region, you can never take any piece of architectureentirely at face value.But the castle is a wonderful spot to get a sense of the old, indeed the trulyancient, city of Byblos, from which Phoenician seafarers once sailed out to allpoints of the known world and beyond—for the suggestion that the Phoeniciansreached the Americas thousands of years before Columbus continues to besupported by intriguing though fragmentary evidence.12[part0121.html#chapter14-12] There is also a mysterious connection with AncientEgypt that goes far beyond the papyrus trade between these two ancient peoples.This connection concerns the god Osiris, whose celestial image the AncientEgyptians saw in the constellation of Orion. The father of Horus and the husbandof Isis, the goddess of magic, Osiris was, according to tradition, a great kingof primordial times, who offered the gifts of civilization to those who werewilling to receive them.13 [part0121.html#chapter14-13] After weaning theindigenous peoples of Egypt:from their miserable and barbarous manners, he taught them how to till theearth, and how to sow and reap crops, he formulated a code of laws for them, andmade them worship the gods and perform service to them. He then left Egypt andtraveled over the rest of the world teaching the various nations to do what hisown subjects were doing. He forced no man to carry out his instructions, but bymeans of gentle persuasion and an appeal to their reason, he succeeded ininducing them to practice what he preached.14 [part0121.html#chapter14-14]The deeds of this great civilizing teacher as they are recorded in the AncientEgyptian annals are, of course, reminiscent of the mission of those companies ofgods, magicians and sages whom the Edfu Building Texts tell us “wandered theearth” in their great ships after the flood that destroyed their homeland,seeking to bring about the resurrection of the antediluvian world. And theantagonist, Set, who appears in the Edfu tradition and is eventually defeatedand subdued by Horus, also plays a key role in the Osiris cycle of myths. Heplots against the god-king while he is away on his civilizing mission and on hisreturn he contrives to murder him with the help, significantly, of seventy-twoco-conspirators.15 [part0121.html#chapter14-15] There is code here for, as thereader will recall, the number 72 is the heartbeat of the precessional cycle—thenumber of years required for one degree of precessional motion.The body of Osiris, we are told, is placed in a sarcophagus by Set and the otherconspirators and thrown in the Nile, whence the current carries it north and outinto the Mediterranean sea. The waves carried the box to the coast of Lebanon:and cast it up at Byblos, and as soon as it rested on the ground a large treesprang up and, growing all around the box, enclosed it on every side. The Kingof Byblos marveled at the size of this tree and had it cut down and caused apillar for his palace to be made of that portion of the trunk which containedthe box.16 [part0121.html#chapter14-16]Discovering the whereabouts of her husband’s remains, Isis takes ship to Byblos,goes to the palace and contrives to have herself appointed as nursemaid to thechildren of the King. When unobserved she transforms into a swallow and fliesround and round the pillar lamenting. Eventually she reveals her true identityand persuades the monarch to give her the pillar, from which she removes thesarcophagus containing the dead body of Osiris and returns with it to Egypt.17[part0121.html#chapter14-17]What happens next is a long story, that we needn’t go into here, but the upshotis the resurrection of Osiris in the heavens as the constellation of Orionwhere, as a star god, he reigns over the afterlife kingdom, his consort Isis byhis side in the form of the bright star Sirius (called Sopdu or Sept in theAncient Egyptian language, often rendered in Greek as Sothis).18[part0121.html#chapter14-18] In one text, which makes these stellaridentifications particularly clear, Isis speaks of Osiris as follows:Thy sacred image, Orion in heaven, rises and sets every day; I am Sothisfollowing after him, and I will not forsake him.19 [part0121.html#chapter14-19]And in the Pyramid Texts we read, among many similar utterances, that “Osirishas come as Orion.”20 [part0121.html#chapter14-20] Multiple other referencesalso identify deceased pharaohs of Egypt with Osiris and with the stars of Orionand Sirius, for example:O flesh of the King, do not decay … You shall reach the sky as Orion, your soulshall be as effective as Sothis …21 [part0121.html#chapter14-21]Likewise:O King, the sky conceives you with Orion, the dawn light bears you with Orion.He who lives, lives by the command of the gods, and you live. You will regularlyascend with Orion from the eastern region of the sky, you will regularly descendwith Orion into the western region of the sky.22 [part0121.html#chapter14-22]From such texts, notes Egyptologist Selim Hassan:I think it cannot possibly be denied that, at one period in their history, theEgyptians believed that the souls of their Kings either mingled with the stars,or became a star … and this tradition never entirely died out. Moreover theassociation of the Giza Pyramids with the stellar cult was long maintained bytradition and those of Khufu and Khafre retained the reputation of beingconnected with star-worship as late as the Arab Period.23[part0121.html#chapter14-23]In the same passage, Hassan then goes on to make an observation of the greatestrelevance to my research. “In the Geographical Dictionary, Mo’gam-el-Buldan, byYakut el-Hamawi,” he writes, “Vol. VIII, p. 457 (Cairo Edition)”:it is said, after giving the dimensions of the two largest of the Giza Pyramids:“To both of them the Sabians made their pilgrimage.” Now, of course, theseSabians were star-worshippers, and if I guess rightly they had derived theirname from the Egyptian word sba, “star.” The Sabians were followers of anancient religion … worshippers of the hosts of Heaven, the heavenly bodies …Whatever the origin of their name may have been, the fact remains that theyfully recognized the Pyramids of Khufu and Khafre as being monuments connectedwith the stellar cult, and revered them as places of pilgrimage.24[part0121.html#chapter14-24]The connection Hassan makes here is a remarkable one, because the home city ofthe Sabians, since time immemorial, was Harran in southeastern Turkey,25[part0121.html#chapter14-25] within a few miles of Göbekli Tepe. Moreover, aswell as being “star-worshippers,” these Sabians of Harran were followers of the“Books of Thoth”—see Chapter Eleven—in which the Ancient Egyptian wisdom god hadset down the “words of the Sages.” Indeed in Islamic times (for hundreds ofyears after the revelation of the Koran to the Prophet Muhammad in the seventhcentury AD), the Sabians were able to win exemption from persecution at thehands of the Muslims by claiming not to be pagans but a “people of the book,”distinguished, like the Christians and Jews, by their possession of a divinelyrevealed Scripture.26 [part0121.html#chapter14-26] When asked to show their“book” they produced a copy of the Hermetic texts—the Greek and Latin writingspurporting to be dialogues between Thoth (the Hermes of the Greeks, the Mercuryof the Romans) and various of his pupils.27 [part0121.html#chapter14-27] It isnoteworthy that Thoth, as well as being the god of wisdom, was also “Lord of theMoon,”28 [part0121.html#chapter14-28] and that the major temple of Harran wasdedicated to the moon god of their own pantheon, whose name was Sin.29[part0121.html#chapter14-29] Last but not least, Philo of Byblos tells us thatSanchuniathon, the source of his Phoenician History:carefully searched out the works of Taautos. He did this since he realized thatTaautos was the first person under the sun who thought of the invention ofwriting and who began to compose records, thereby laying the foundation, as itwere, of learning. The Egyptians call him Thouth and the Alexandrians Thoth, andthe Greeks translated his name as Hermes.30 [part0121.html#chapter14-30]We stay a few hours longer in Byblos. Excavations of the ancient city lie allaround the Crusader castle. There’s a Roman colonnade, a small theater,Phoenician ramparts, the remains, little more than foundations, of the Temple ofBaalat-Gebel, circa 2800 BC and dedicated to the Phoenician patron goddess ofByblos, and the so-called L-shaped temple, circa 2600 BC—a sacred lake onceseparated the two edifices. On top of a podium a number of small, crude obelisksstill stand—the “Temple of the Obelisks,” circa 1900 to 1600 BC. There are theremains of the royal necropolis of the Kings of Byblos, circa eighteenth centuryBC down to tenth century BC, but mingled in with all this, very close to it, isthe Neolithic quarter, dating back to 5000 BC and beyond, where the inhabitantsof Byblos first started to make floors of crushed limestone around 4500 BC.31[part0121.html#chapter14-31]All these ruins and remains are jumbled together promiscuously, one on top ofthe other, around one another, century upon century, millenium upon millenium,receding back into prehistory, very comprehensively picked clean by thearchaeologists and left on show as tourist attractions. The site does not touchmy heart and in the absence of Sanchuniathon’s original text, in the absenceeven of Philo’s History, other than in the fragments that have survived, I feelthere’s nothing more of use that I can do here.It’s time to move on.Hill of pillarsIt’s a short flight from Beirut to Istanbul and from Istanbul it’s only anothershort hop to the city of ŞanlIurfa, which Santha and I will use as our base forvisiting Harran, the city of the mysterious “star-worshipping” Sabians, and fora return visit to Göbekli Tepe. Our first target, however, is neither of theseplaces. Instead we seek out an as yet unexcavated site which shows everyindication of being as old as Göbekli Tepe and which appears to have beendedicated to the same mysterious purpose. The name of this site, I’ve learnedfrom my background research, is Karahan Tepe, but knowing its name is one thing;finding it is quite another.It’s baking hot in southeastern Turkey in July. Our driver speaks English sothere’s no problem communicating with him, and he in turn can communicate withothers on our behalf, but nobody we pass as we drive through a landscape ofirrigated fields and barren hills seems to have the faintest idea where KarahanTepe is. Well, why should they, after all? It’s just another hill and by allaccounts it’s in a fairly deserted spot. We do find it in the end, however,about 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) south of the main E90 highway and 65 kilometers(40.4 miles) east of ŞanlIurfa. That’s where we spot a little farmsteadsurrounded by low walls and poor fields at the end of a bumpy dirt track. Thefarmer points to a hill rising a few hundred meters to our north. It’s on hisland, he says, but we’re welcome to take a look. He assigns his teenage son toshow us how to drive our car as close as possible to the site, then we step outand go the rest of the way on foot.The tepe is a ridge of limestone running roughly north to south with steepslopes, covered in loose crumbly soil, overgrown with yellow grass on itseastern and western flanks. The top of the ridge is about 705 meters (2,300feet) above sea level, but the climb from where we’ve parked is only another 50meters (164 feet) and almost immediately we start seeing the characteristicT-shapes of the pillars we’re familiar with from Göbekli Tepe. They areeverywhere around the sides of the ridge, dozens of them, some organized incircles, others in what appear to be parallel rows, but all of them are quitedeeply buried with only the distinctive tops of the “T” protruding above theground.image [../images/00048.jpeg]Figure 45Extraordinarily, other than confirming that Karahan Tepe is the same age asGöbekli Tepe, i.e. between 11,000 and 12,000 years old, and that it wasabandoned at around the same time, i.e. around 10,200 years ago, after which itwas never resettled,32 [part0121.html#chapter14-32] almost no archaeology hasbeen done on the site at all. Local people, on the other hand, have been busyhere looking for treasure and their efforts have exposed and broken a number ofthe pillars, two with serpents carved on them exactly in the manner thatserpents are depicted on the pillars of Göbekli Tepe.Along the top of the ridge we find numerous semi-spherical depressions, likelittle craters, cut into the rock. Some have very clean, sharply defined edgesthat are typically about 30 centimeters (1 foot) in diameter and up to 15centimeters (6 inches) deep—although there are also smaller and larger cupulespresent. In most cases they are grouped into arrays of a dozen or more,sometimes in rows, sometimes in circular or spiral patterns—but in such a randomway that it is difficult to see the logic behind them.As at Göbekli Tepe, it is clear that the quarrying of the pillars was done onsite and we find a number of places where parallel grooves, marking out theshape of a pillar, have been cut into the bedrock of the ridge. There is onealmost complete T-shaped pillar still in situ in the quarry that measures 4.5meters (14 feet 10 inches) high, 1.5 meters (5 feet) wide and 80 centimeters (2feet 7 inches) thick.33 [part0121.html#chapter14-33] Looking from that to theforest of pillars with only their heads protruding above the flanks of the hill,I can’t help but wonder what would be found here if a proper excavation wasdone. Göbekli Tepe has already rewritten the history of mankind and here isanother Göbekli Tepe, pristine, practically untouched, and no one seems in theleast bit interested. Indeed there is even a broken L-shaped fragment of acarefully cut block that once formed a complete square “window” or“porthole”—similar pieces have been found intact at Göbekli Tepe—that has beenused here as part of the hearth for some shepherd’s fire and now sits blackenedwith smoke in a sheltered corner near the top of the ridge.It’s incomprehensible to me that a place as important as Karahan Tepe, with somuch to teach us, could be so ignored and so disregarded. I have often said, asI did at the end of the last chapter, that we are a species with amnesia. Iattribute our great forgetfulness of our own past, the blank pages in ourmemory, to the terrible cataclysms the earth passed through at the end of theIce Age, but here at Karahan Tepe I’m reminded that our collective stupor isalso often willfully self-inflicted—as though we no longer care to know where wecome from or who we really are.Control of the pastThe next day Santha and I go back to Göbekli Tepe. Klaus Schmidt is still aliveat this point in July 2014, but he’s away in Germany for the summer and in justa few days’ time he will die of a heart attack.In his absence I want to take another look at the site. In particular, I’mhoping to arrange to be there at night, so that I can experience it under theopen sky and get a sense of its relationship to the stars above as well as tothe earth below. Instead, what I get is another forceful reminder of how wehumans willfully desecrate the precious gifts bequeathed to us by our ancestors.Even in 2013 the archaeological vandalizing and defacing of the site was welladvanced with a hideous raised walkway in place, but what has happened since ourlast visit is almost beyond words to describe. A massively ugly wooden roof nowlooms over the megalithic enclosures, entirely covering them, and hulkingplatforms loaded with tons of stones have been suspended beneath it to preventthe roof from blowing away in high winds. These platforms, together with thestruts supporting the roof and the prominent “no entry” signs scattered around,make it almost impossible to see the megalithic pillars or to appreciate theirprofound, original beauty and spiritual power.What the archaeologists have done—of course, they claim they did it to “protect”the site—is a travesty, an abomination, a masterpiece of ugliness, and we, theglobal public, whose heritage Göbekli Tepe is, are left cheated and bereft. Isimply cannot understand the minds that could have boxed in, caged andimprisoned Göbekli Tepe in this way. I cannot begin to imagine what they werethinking. And even if the roof is “temporary” as is presently claimed—until, nodoubt, a larger one is put in place—that is no excuse. Better no roof at all(the site has managed very well without one for nearly nineteen years since thefirst excavations began) than even five minutes of this vile “temporary” horror.Besides, I have grave doubts about how “temporary” it will be. It has takenalmost a year for the German Archaeological Institute to put the roof up (theywere already working on it during our previous visit in September 2013), a lotof money has been spent on it, and I fear we will not see it removed andreplaced with something more aesthetically appropriate to the majesty andmystery of Göbekli Tepe for a very long while.As to a night visit, and my plan to see the stars with the megaliths around me …What a joke! The roof has cut Göbekli Tepe off entirely from the cosmos. Itfeels almost like a deliberate, calculated act of disempowerment—as thoughsomeone among the powers that be suddenly woke up and realized how dangerousthis ancient place has become to the established order of things and howsubversive it potentially is to the system of mind control, very much includingcontrol of the past, that keeps modern society in order.Ancient astronomersThat night back in our hotel I’m working on my laptop, going through a pile ofresearch papers about Göbekli Tepe that I’ve downloaded and brought with me.Most of them are from academic journals, but one is from my own website. Writtenby registered engineer and environmental geologist Paul Burley, I published itin March 2013 and haven’t read it since. I recall at the time feeling it wasimportant, but I can’t immediately remember why. Göbekli Tepe wasn’t as centralto my concerns then as it is today. Now as I read through Burley’s paper in thelight of everything I’ve learned since March 2013, its central message, andexactly why it matters, hits me like a shot of adrenaline.Klaus Schmidt’s opposition to any form of astronomical connection at GöbekliTepe, which I reported briefly in Chapter One, was based more on his ownprofound ignorance of astronomy and distaste for the subject, than anythingelse. In the teeth of this hostility from the lead archaeologist, however, anumber of scientists have studied Göbekli Tepe to see if any of the enclosures,or the groups of pillars within them, reveal any obvious astronomicalalignments. It is the unanimous testimony of all these studies that Göbekli Tepeis a profoundly astronomical site, that its builders observed the stars closely,and that they were able to manifest these observations very successfully in thealignments of the structures on the ground.I’ll give a few examples here.Dr. Giulio Magli, Professor of Mathematical Physics at the Politecnico diMilano, is a leading Italian astrophysicist who has conductedarchaeoastronomical studies of a number of ancient sites and monuments aroundthe world. In 2013 he published a research paper on Göbekli Tepe based onprecise computer simulations of changes in the sky brought about over longperiods by precession34 [part0121.html#chapter14-34]—a phenomenon that we havealready explored. It is Magli’s case that Sirius, the star the Ancient Egyptiansidentified with the goddess Isis, was an object of particular interest to thebuilders of Göbekli Tepe:Simulating the sky in the tenth millenium BC, it is possible to see that a quitespectacular phenomenon occurred at Göbekli Tepe in that period: the “birth” of a“new” star, and certainly not of an ordinary one, as it is the brightest starand the fourth most brilliant object of the sky: Sirius. Indeed precession, atthe latitude of Göbekli Tepe, brought Sirius under the horizon in the yearsaround 15,000 BC. After reaching the minimum, Sirius started to come closer tothe horizon and it became visible again, very low and close to due south, toward9300 BC.35 [part0121.html#chapter14-35]Thereafter, Magli goes on to demonstrate, the rising points of Sirius along thehorizon, which also change very slowly as a result of precession, appear to havebeen “tracked” at Göbekli Tepe by Enclosure D, Enclosure C and Enclosure B. Theextrapolated mean azimuths of these enclosures, taken as the mid-lines betweenthe two central monoliths in each case, align with the rising azimuth of Siriusin respectively 9100 BC, 8750 BC and 8300 BC.36 [part0121.html#chapter14-36]“The structures of Göbekli Tepe,” Magli concludes, “were conceived to celebrate,and then follow in the course of the centuries, the appearance of a brilliant‘guest’ star in the sky: Sirius.”37 [part0121.html#chapter14-37]Professor Robert Schoch of Boston University, though not an astronomer, alsodetected astronomical alignments at Göbekli Tepe, and in the same region of thesky highlighted by Magli. However, Schoch came to a different conclusion aboutwhat stellar objects might have interested the builders. “This is a difficultquestion to answer,” he wrote, before going on to offer the followinghypothesis:On the morning of the Vernal Equinox of circa 10,000 BCE, before the sun rosedue east at Göbekli Tepe, the Pleiades, Taurus, and the top of Orion were inview in the direction indicated by the central stones of Enclosure D, withOrion’s belt not far above the horizon as dawn broke (as seen from the bestvantage points in the area). A similar scenario played out for the orientationof the central stones of Enclosure C in circa 9500 BCE and for Enclosure B incirca 9000 BCE. Enclosure A is oriented toward the Pleiades, Taurus, and Orionon the morning of the Vernal Equinox circa 8500 BCE, but due to precessionalchanges, the entire belt of Orion no longer rose above the horizon before dawnbroke. By about 8150 BCE the belt of Orion remained below the horizon at dawn onthe morning of the Vernal Equinox. These dates fit well the timeframeestablished for Göbekli Tepe on the basis of radiocarbon dating.38[part0121.html#chapter14-38]Other non-astronomers, author Andrew Collins and chartered engineer Rodney Hale,looked in the opposite direction to Schoch and Magli, i.e. north instead ofsouth, and found strong alignments with the setting of Deneb, the brightest starin the constellation of Cygnus. Again the alignments turn out to track thechanges in the position of the star caused by precession.39[part0121.html#chapter14-39] The growing impression that the builders of GöbekliTepe paid close attention to the stars and were fully aware of the effects ofprecessional motion on the celestial landscape, was confirmed in January 2015 inan article in the journal Archaeological Discovery, by Alessandro De Lorenzisand Vincenzo Orofino, both of the Department of Mathematics and Physics at theUniversity of Salento, Italy. They concluded that Collins and Hale were correctand that, on the northern side of their orientations, “the central pillars ofthe studied enclosures are in fact turned to face the setting of Deneb.”40[part0121.html#chapter14-40] Lorentis and Orofino refined the dates given byCollins and Hale, pushing them back by about 200 years, but agreed that subtlechanges in the orientation of the enclosures were evidence of the tracking ofpre-cession.41 [part0121.html#chapter14-41]Astrophysicist Juan Antonio Belmonte also looked at the astronomicalcharacteristics of Göbekli Tepe. He noted that among the circular enclosures,“there is one with nearly rectangular walls, which were almost perfectly alignedto the cardinal points.”42 [part0121.html#chapter14-42] Needless to say suchexact alignments, as at the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, cannot have beenachieved without the use of equally exact astronomical observations.Belmonte also paid attention to the “profuse decoration” of the T-pillars atGöbekli Tepe, concluding that these may represent:yet other astronomical observations, such as the crescent and the star, socommon in later cultures of the Middle East … Then there are what could beinterpreted as totemic representations of animals, which, if we may continue tospeculate, could symbolize constellations such as Leo, Taurus and Scorpio.This is the right moment to deal with Klaus Schmidt’s argument (see Chapter One)that there couldn’t possibly be any “astronomical figures” at Göbekli Tepi,because “the zodiac constellations were not recognized until Babylonian times,nine thousand years after Göbekli Tepe.” I didn’t challenge him on this pointwhen I interviewed him, because I was more interested in hearing his own viewson Göbekli Tepe, rather than engaging him in a possibly acrimonious debate.Clearly, however, Belmonte, who knows his stuff, does not agree with theposition taken by Schmidt.Neither, for that matter, does the Russian astronomer and historian of scienceAlexander Gurshtein, who traces the first recognition and naming ofconstellations—notably the Great Bear—to 20,000 BC,43[part0121.html#chapter14-43] and more detailed knowledge of the zodiac to theepoch of 5600 BC.44 [part0121.html#chapter14-44]German archaeoastronomer Michael Rappengluck pushes the origins of the zodiaceven further back than that, however. He has identified an accurate depiction ofthe zodiacal constellation of Taurus painted more than 17,000 years ago in theHall of Bulls in Lascaux cave in France.45 [part0121.html#chapter14-45]Rappengluck points out that there are four key moments of the year, the springequinox, the autumn equinox, the winter solstice and the summer solstice. We’veseen already how the “character” of a world age has long been thought to begoverned by the zodiacal constellation that “houses” the sun on the springequinox, but other constellations also “house” the other three prominent“stations of the sun” at the autumn equinox, and at the summer and wintersolstices, and when a shift of age takes place with one constellation giving wayto another on the spring equinox, so the constellations governing the otherthree “stations” also shift.There is not space to go into the evidence in detail here, but the essence ofRappengluck’s argument concerning Lascaux is that depicted there is the wholeconstellation of Taurus (in one of the aurochs or “bull” figures in the Hall ofBulls) and also above its shoulder, in a distinctive pattern of six dots, thesix visible stars of the Pleiades, which form a highly recognizable element ofTaurus. Moreover a date can be put on this depiction:The Pleiades in 15,300 BC were very near the point of the autumn equinox … Thesix stars in the “Salle des Taureaux” therefore represent a striking andexcellent heavenly marker for the beginning of autumn … The epoch calculatedastronomically lies extraordinarily close to the … carbon-14 dating [for humanactivity in this part of the cave] corresponding to 15,300 BC.46[part0121.html#chapter14-46]In other work Rappengluck provides further compelling evidence that ourancestors, at least as early as the epoch between 16,000 BC and 10,000 BC:recognized single and very complex star patterns, including the Milky Way, theNorthern Crown in the cave of El Castillo (Spain), the Pleiades in the cave ofLascaux (France) and the main constellations of the sky at the same location.47[part0121.html#chapter14-47]He also documents a rock panel in the cave of La Tete du Lion (France) that:shows the combination of a star pattern—Aldebaran in the Bull and thePleiades—with a drawing of the moon’s cycle above. This picture comes from theSolutrean epoch [ca 19,000 to 20,000 BC]. It shows not only a remarkablesimilarity with the representation in the Lascaux cave, but clearly connects thestar pattern with part of the lunar cycle.48 [part0121.html#chapter14-48]Rappengluck’s conclusion, and again I must cut a long story short, is that:hunter-gatherers of Palaeolithic epochs looked up to the starry sky and saw theopen cluster of the Pleiades with the wandering moon and sun near or between theGolden Gate of the ecliptic, 21,000 years ago.49 [part0121.html#chapter14-49]The “Golden Gate of the ecliptic” that Rappengluck refers to here wastraditionally conceived of as that area of the heavens bounded by the Hyades andthe Pleiades (both of which are star groups within the constellation of Taurus),between which, as though through a great celestial “gate,” the eclipticpasses.50 [part0121.html#chapter14-50] The “ecliptic” is the technical term forthe sun’s perceived “path” through the heavens. The implication, therefore, isthat the path of the sun (and the moon51 [part0121.html#chapter14-51]) againstthe background of the constellations of the zodiac was observed, depicted andunderstood in the Palaeolithic, perhaps as much as 10,000 years before GöbekliTepe was built. For this reason Belmonte makes a point of citing Rappengluck’swork, and indeed of showing a photo provided by Rappengluck of the Taurus figurein the Hall of Bulls at Lascaux,52 [part0121.html#chapter14-52] when he makeshis seemingly off the cuff remark that zodiacal constellations “such as Leo,Taurus and Scorpio” might be the inspiration for the “totemic” animals depictedat Göbekli Tepe.For Belmonte, in summary, Göbekli Tepe offers evidence that:a completely unknown hunter-gatherer society more than 11,000 years ago soughtto create monumental structures linked to the heavens. This series ofsanctuaries, built presumably one after the other and even one upon another, mayhave been used for centuries, perhaps millennia, to chart the heavens. However,for reasons which are unknown, the constructors deliberately buried thestructures, creating conditions which contributed to their excellent state ofpreservation despite their great antiquity.53 [part0121.html#chapter14-53]Certainly the indigenous inhabitants of the Göbekli Tepe area werehunter-gatherers—and completely unknown hunter-gatherers at that! But it hasbeen my thesis throughout this book that their sudden venture into spectacularmonumental architecture, closely followed by their equally spectacular“invention” of agriculture, is very strange. Indeed it amounts to an almostinexplicable “great leap forward” that cries out for a coherent explanationwhich archaeology has yet to provide. The hypothesis we are exploring here, andthat I believe might explain these anomalies, is that the survivors of a lostcivilization, who had already mastered agriculture and knew everything there wasto know about building with megaliths, had settled among the hunter-gatherers ofGöbekli Tepe following the Younger Dryas cataclysm and transferred some of theirskills to them.Now, in addition to megalithic architecture and agriculture we must take theevidence of astronomy into account. At first sight, while the work of Belmonte,Collins, Hale, Schoch, Magli and others confirms that competent astronomers musthave been at work at Göbekli Tepe, we cannot say that the level of knowledgemanifested in the alignments of the pillars and enclosures was necessarily thatof a sophisticated “civilization.” We’ve seen from the research done byGurshtein and Rappengluck that careful observations of the sky, andidentification of constellations we can still recognize today, can be tracedback into the Neolithic and beyond that into the art of the painted caves of thePalaeolithic 20,000 or more years ago. So expressions of such knowledge atGöbekli Tepe need not surprise us unduly.But suppose there was something else—something that hunter-gatherers, no matterhow savvy, could not be expected to have known under any circumstances?It is that elusive “something else” that Paul Burley’s work brought home to me,like a shot of adrenaline, when I re-read his paper in my hotel room inŞanlIurfa in July 2014.Neolithic puzzleBurley’s paper is entitled “Göbekli Tepe: Temples Communicating an AncientCosmic Geography.” He wrote it originally in June 2011, I met him at theConference of Precession and Ancient Knowledge in Sedona, Arizona, in Septemberthat year, we exchanged a couple of emails during 2012, and in February 2013 heasked me to read his paper, which he said concerned “evidence of a zodiac on oneof the pillars at Göbekli Tepe.” I read it, replied that I found it “verypersuasive and interesting, with significant implications” and told him I’d liketo publish it on the Articles page of my website. Paul agreed and the articlewent live on March 8, 2013.54 [part0121.html#chapter14-54] It’s still there,accessible through the URL provided in the note.“Significant implications,” I now realize as I read through the paper again inmy hotel room in ŞanlIurfa, was a huge understatement. But I didn’t make myfirst visit to Göbekli Tepe until September 2013 and by then, clearly, I’dforgotten the gist of Burley’s argument, which focuses almost exclusively onEnclosure D and on the very pillar, Pillar 43, that I’d been most interested inwhen I was there. My interest in it had been sparked by Belmonte’s suggestionthat the relief carving of a scorpion near its base (which the reader willrecall was hidden by rubble that Schmidt refused to allow me to move) might be arepresentation of the zodiacal constellation of Scorpio. So it was a lapse on mypart not to have re-read Burley’s paper documenting “a zodiac” on the samepillar before I traveled to the site. But we’re all human, we all make mistakes,we all forget things and despite acknowledging its “significant implications” inour correspondence six months earlier, what Burley had discovered had slipped mymind entirely on my September 2013 visit.Here’s where he gets to his point:One of the limestone pillars [in Enclosure D] includes a scene in bas relief onthe upper portion of one of its sides. There is a bird with outstretched wings,two smaller birds, a scorpion, a snake, a circle, and a number of wavy lines andcord-like features. At first glance this lithified menagerie appears to besimply a hodgepodge of animals and geometrical designs randomly placed to fillin the broad side of the pillar.The key to unlocking this early Neolithic puzzle is the circle situated at thecenter of the scene. I am immediately reminded of the cosmic Father—the Sun. Thenext clues are the scorpion facing up toward the sun, and the large birdseemingly holding the sun upon its outstretched wing. In fact the sun figureappears to be located accurately on the ecliptic with respect to the familiarconstellation of Scorpio, although the scorpion on the pillar occupies only theleft portion, or head, of our modern conception of that constellation. As suchthe sun symbol is located as close to the galactic center as it can be on theecliptic as it crosses the galactic plane.Bear with me, and I’ll explain all this. Meanwhile, let’s continue with Burley’sarticle because it’s his next statement that really has me sitting up and payingattention:What’s important here is for some unknown reason the builders of Göbekli Tepeconstructed a temple apparently highlighting a time 11,600 years in theirfuture. Yet this scene is intentional. The symbolism is clear and in keepingwith many mythologies describing this very same event—occurring at the very timewe live in today!Burley then presents a graphic that “illustrates the crossing of the galacticplane of the Milky Way near the center of the galaxy, with several familiarconstellations nearby.” A second graphic shows the same view with the additionof the ancient constellations represented on the pillar:Note that the outstretched wings, sun, bird legs and snake all appear to beoriented to emphasize the sun’s path along the ecliptic … The similarity of thebas relief to the crossing of the ecliptic and galactic equator at the center ofthe Milky Way is difficult to reject, supporting the possibility that humansrecognized and documented the precession of the equinoxes thousands of yearsearlier than is generally accepted by scholars … Göbekli Tepe was built as asymbolic sphere communicating a very ancient understanding of world and cosmicgeography. Why this knowledge was intentionally buried soon afterward remains amystery.I don’t immediately understand everything that Burley is saying in all this, butI understand enough to get started on it and fortunately I have astronomysoftware—Stellarium—on my computer that can simulate the ancient skies takingaccount of precession. More importantly, the program can show me the sky of ourown time and will allow me to scroll through it day by day, month by month,going forward or back as I wish, enlarging and inspecting any specific elementsthat I’m interested in. Most often I study ancient skies, not modern ones, buttonight it’s our own time I need to take a look at.image [../images/00049.jpeg]Figure 46: The celestial imagery of Pillar 43.Or, rather, not exactly our own time, July 2014 as I sit in front of my computerin ŞanlIurfa, but a year and a half earlier, the winter solstice, December 21,2012—the much hyped “end date” (that passed with not so much as a whimper, letalone a bang) of the famous Mayan calendar.Message on a pillar?Here’s what I’m aware of already as I open Stellarium on my computer. When PaulBurley talks about the sun depicted on the Göbekli Tepe pillar being located “asclose to the galactic center as it can be on the ecliptic,” and when he alsomakes a point of telling me that Scorpio is involved, I know he can only bereferring to one epoch—the epoch of the year 2000, give or take a maximum ofabout 40 years on either side (i.e. from 1960 to 2040). The great band of starsand clouds of interstellar dust arching across the sky that we call the MilkyWay, and that is in fact our own home galaxy viewed edge on, is crossed by theecliptic—i.e. the sun’s apparent path through the heavens—twice a year. One ofthese gigantic interchanges is in the North between the constellations of Geminiand Taurus; in our epoch the sun stands here at the northern hemisphere’s summersolstice, i.e. around June 21. The second interchange is in the South betweenthe constellations of Sagittarius and Scorpio, and in our epoch the sun standshere at the northern hemisphere’s winter solstice, i.e. around December 21.The reader will recall that precession has the visual effect, as viewed fromearth, of causing the constellations that “house” the sun at the four keymoments of the year—the two equinoxes and the two solstices—to shift very slowlyaround the belt of the zodiac, with the sun spending 2,160 years “in” eachzodiacal constellation at each key moment, before the whole system slips roundfar enough for the sun to have passed completely from one constellation intoanother. When this happens at the equinox, it happens at the other three“stations” as well. Indeed, it is a good mental exercise to imagine acircle—which represents the ecliptic, i.e. the annual path of the sun—and tomark out at equal intervals around the circumference of this circle the twelveconstellations of the zodiac. Now place four spokes arranged in the form of across inside the circle. Where each of the four ends of the cross touch the edgeof the circle, you have one of the key stations of the sun—the northernhemisphere’s spring equinox (March 21), summer solstice (June 21), autumnequinox (September 21), and winter solstice (December 21). In our epoch, thezodiacal constellations housing the sun at these four stations are Pisces on theMarch equinox, Gemini on the June solstice, Virgo on the September equinox, andSagittarius on the December solstice.image [../images/00050.jpeg]Figure 47: The precessional shift from the Age of Pisces into the Age ofAquarius. As the position of the sun against the background zodiacalconstellations on the spring equinox shifts from Pisces into Aquarius, so thesummer solstice will shift from Gemini into Taurus, the autumn equinox fromVirgo into Leo, and the winter solstice from Sagittarius into Scorpio.However, precession has the effect of very slowly rotating the spokes of thecross. We are nearing the end of the “Age of Pisces” now (i.e. of the 2,160years when Pisces houses the sun on the March equinox) and the end of the spokethat was in Pisces will soon rotate into Aquarius (hence the song, “this is thedawning of the Age of Aquarius”). But because the cross is, if you like, weldedtogether to form a single fixed unit, all its spokes must move together with theresult that as the March equinox shifts from Pisces into Aquarius, so the Junesolstice will shift from Gemini into Taurus, the September equinox from Virgointo Leo, and the December solstice from Sagittarius into Scorpio.I want to avoid undue complications as far as possible here, but let us nowreturn to the Milky Way which, as we’ve seen, is crossed by the path of the suntwice a year. Remember that at each crossing point a pair of zodiacalconstellations sits on either side of the Milky Way, effectively forming thepillars of two celestial gates through which the “road” of the Milky Waypasses—Gemini and Taurus in the North (with the sun presently housed by Geminiat the June solstice) and Sagittarius and Scorpio in the South (with the sunpresently housed by Sagittarius at the December solstice). The relationship ofthese two pairs of zodiacal constellations to the Milky Way is not affected byprecession and NEVER CHANGES. Gemini and Taurus will always mark the northern“gate” of the Milky Way and Sagittarius and Scorpio will always mark thesouthern “gate” of the Milky Way.Of the two, however, it is the Sagittarius–Scorpio gate that is the mostimportant, because it so happens that the part of the Milky Way seen throughthis gate as we look up at the night sky forms the very center and heart of ourgalaxy. Not only that, but because it is the galactic center, in the midst ofwhich, astronomers now believe, sits an immense black hole—“a hyperdense objectfrom which even light cannot escape”55 [part0121.html#chapter14-55]—there is anotable bulge in precisely this area. Last but not least, in the midst of thisso-called “nuclear bulge” is another absolutely distinctive feature thatastronomers call the “dark rift,” which figures prominently in many ancientmythologies,56 [part0121.html#chapter14-56] and which is created by a series ofoverlapping, non-luminous molecular dust clouds.As a result of precession, the December solstice sun is presently housed bySagittarius and thus, as viewed from earth, “targets” the galactic center likethe bead on the barrel of a rifle. The last time this grand celestial line-up ofearth, December-solstice sun and the galactic center occurred was a fullprecessional cycle of 25,920 years ago and the next time it will happen is afull precessional cycle of 25,920 years in the future. We live, in other words,in a very special, indeed rather unique, moment in terms of cosmic andastronomical symbolism. I will elaborate in the next chapter on the symbolicaspect, and why the December solstice matters in particular, but first it isimportant to make something else clear.image [../images/00051.jpeg]Figure 48: The celestial gateways: Sagittarius/Scorpio at right, with the sunpresently housed by Sagittarius at the winter solstice; and Gemini/Taurus atleft, with the sun presently housed by Gemini at the summer solstice.If, hypothetically, some ancient civilization wished to deploy its knowledge ofthe regular movements and changes in the heavens in order to draw attention to aparticular moment in the flow of time, a possibility that we have consideredwith the monuments of Giza, then the precessional world ages, while useful, arenot really precise enough to spell out an exact date. After all, the broadconfigurations of each precessional age hold good for 2,160 years. If we want tobe more specific than that, then we are going to need to find a celestial eventin the period we wish to draw attention to which is (a) an artifact ofprecession and (b) occurs in a much narrower window than that of a fullprecessional world age of 2,160 years.Such an event occurs in our time. It is the arrival of the sun at the Decembersolstice in the southern gate of the Milky Way between Sagittarius and Scorpio,where it targets the galactic center. There are certain imprecisions, mainly todo with the width of the sun’s disc and over what period we can say it lines upexactly with the center of the Milky Way when viewed from earth, butnonetheless, we are not talking about 2,160 years here. The exact targeting ofthe galactic center occurs in a window that is no more than 80-years wide and wewill continue to be in that window for approximately another 25 years.This creates an interesting situation with regard to the message of Pillar 43 atGöbekli Tepe, because if Paul Burley is right, the reliefs on that pillar usesymbolic language to depict the December solstice sun at the southern gate ofthe Milky Way between Sagittarius and Scorpio.In other words, those reliefs are speaking to our time.They are speaking to us."},{"pageContent":" Chapter 15 [part0131.html#c_ch15]The Place of Creation [part0131.html#c_ch15]As I sit in my hotel room in ŞanlIurfa in July 2014 spinning the skies on mycomputer screen, I’m coming more and more to the conclusion that Paul Burley hashad a genius insight about the scene on Pillar 43 at Göbekli Tepe. Burley’slanguage in his paper is careful—almost diffident. As we saw in ChapterFourteen, he says that “the sun figure appears to be located accurately on theecliptic with respect to the familiar constellation of Scorpio.” He speaks ofother “familiar constellations” nearby. And he draws our attention to the largebird—the vulture—“seemingly holding the sun upon an outstretched wing.” He doesnot say which constellation he believes the vulture represents, but the graphicshe includes to reinforce his argument leave no room for doubt that he regards itas an ancient representation of the constellation of Sagittarius.1[part0122.html#chapter15-1]We’ve already seen that there is evidence for the identification ofconstellations going far back into the Ice Age, some of which were portrayed inthose remote times in forms that are recognizable to us today. From the lastchapter the reader will recall Michael Rappengluck’s work on the zodiacalconstellation of Taurus, depicted at Lascaux some 17,000 years ago as an auroch(ancient species of wild cattle) with the six visible stars of the Pleiades onits shoulder.Acknowledging such surprising continuities in the ways that some constellationsare depicted does not mean that all the constellations we are familiar with nowhave always been depicted in the same way by all cultures at all periods ofhistory. This is very far from being the case. Constellations are subject tosometimes radical change depending on which imaginary figures different cultureschoose to project upon the sky. For example, the Mesopotamian constellation ofthe Bull of Heaven and the modern constellation of Taurus share the Hyadescluster as the head, but in other respects are very different.2[part0122.html#chapter15-2] Likewise the Mesopotamian constellation of the Bowand Arrow is built from stars in the constellations that we call Argo and CanisMajor, with the star Sirius as the tip of the arrow. The Chinese also have a Bowand Arrow constellation built from pretty much the same stars but the arrow isshorter, with Sirius forming not the tip but the target.3[part0122.html#chapter15-3]Even when constellation boundaries remain the same from culture to culture, theways in which those constellations are seen can be very different. Thus theAncient Egyptians knew the constellation that we call the Great Bear, butrepresented it as the foreleg of a bull. They saw the Little Bear (Ursa Minor)as a jackal. They depicted the zodiacal constellation of Cancer as a scarabbeetle. The constellation of Draco, which we see as a dragon, was figured by theAncient Egyptians as a hippopotamus with a crocodile on its back.4[part0122.html#chapter15-4]There can therefore be no objection in principle to the suggestion that theconstellation we call Sagittarius, “the Archer”—and depict as a centaurman-horse hybrid holding a bow with arrow drawn—could have been seen by thebuilders of Göbekli Tepe as a vulture with outstretched wings.I spend hours on Stellarium toggling back and forth between the sky of 9600 BCand the sky of our own epoch, focusing on the region between Sagittarius andScorpio—the region Burley believes is depicted on Pillar 43—and looking at therelationship of the sun to these background constellations.The first thing that becomes clear to me is that a vulture with outstretchedwings makes a very good figure of Sagittarius; indeed it’s a much better, moreintuitive and more obvious way to represent the central part of thisconstellation than the centaur/archer that we have inherited from theMesopotamians and the Greeks. This central part of Sagittarius (minus thecentaur’s legs and tail) happens to contain its brightest stars and forms aneasily recognized asterism often called the “Teapot” by astronomerstoday—because it does resemble a modern teapot with a handle, a pointed lid anda spout. The handle and spout elements, however, could equally effectively bedrawn as the outstretched wings of a vulture, while the pointed “lid” becomesthe vulture’s neck and head. It is the outstretched wing in front of thevulture—the spout of the teapot—that Burley sees as “holding the sun,”represented by the prominent disc in the middle of the scene on Pillar 43.image [../images/00052.jpeg]Figure 49: A vulture with outstretched wings makes a much better, more intuitiveand more obvious way than an archer to represent the bright, central “Teapot”asterism within the constellation of Sagittarius.image [../images/00053.jpeg]Figure 50: Sagittarius and neighboring constellations as interpreted on Pillar43.But the vulture and the sun are only two aspects of the complex imagery of thepillar. Below and just a little to the right of the vulture is a scorpion. Aboveand to the right of the vulture is a second large bird with a long sickle-shapedbeak, and nestled close to this bird is a serpent with a large triangular headand its body coiled into a curve. A third bird, again with a hooked beak, butsmaller, with the look of a chick, is placed below these two figures—again tothe right of the vulture, indeed immediately to the right of its extended frontwing. Below the scorpion is the head and long neck of a fourth bird. Beside thescorpion, rearing up, is another serpent.Part of the reason for my growing confidence in Burley’s conclusion, though hemakes little of it in his paper, is that these figures, with only minoradjustments, compare intriguingly with other constellations around the allegedSagittarius/vulture figure.First and foremost, there is the scorpion below and a little to the right of thevulture, which we’ve seen already has an obvious resemblance to Scorpio, thenext constellation along the zodiac from Sagittarius. Its posture andpositioning are wrong—we’ll look more closely into the implications of this in amoment—but it’s there and it is overlapped by the tail end of the constellationthat we recognize as Scorpio today.Secondly, there’s the large bird above and to the right of the vulture with thecurved body of a serpent nestled close to it. These two figures are in thecorrect position and the correct relationship to one another to match theconstellation we call Ophiuchus, the serpent holder, and the serpentconstellation, Serpens, that Ophiuchus holds.Thirdly, immediately to the right of the extended front wing of the vulturethere’s that other bird, smaller, like a chick, with a hooked beak. I emailBurley about this, and about the different position and orientation of thescorpion on the pillar and the modern constellation of Scorpio, and we arrive,after some back and forth, at a solution. Constellation boundaries, as thereader will recall, are not necessarily drawn in the same place by all culturesat all periods and it’s clear that there’s been a shift over time in theconstellation boundaries here. The chick on Pillar 43 appears to have formed asmall constellation of its own in the minds of the Göbekli Tepe astronomers—aconstellation that utilized some of the important stars today considered to bepart of Scorpio. The chick’s hooked beak is correctly positioned, and its bodyis the correct shape, to match the head and claws of Scorpio.5[part0122.html#chapter15-5]Fourthly, beside the scorpion on Pillar 43 is a serpent and beneath the scorpionare the head and long neck of yet another bird, with a headless anthropomorphicfigure positioned to its right. The serpent matches the tail of Sagittarius (aswe’ve seen, the vulture appears to be composed from the central part ofSagittarius only—the Teapot—so this leaves the remainder of the constellationavailable to the ancients for other uses). The best contenders for the bird, andfor the peculiar little anthropomorphic figure to its right are parts of theconstellations we know today as Pavo and Triangulum Australe. The remainder ofPavo may be involved with further figures present on the pillar to the left ofthe bird.As is the case with Sagittarius, elements of the modern constellation of Scorpiohave been redeployed in the ancient constellations depicted on Pillar 43. Onlythe tail of our Scorpio is in the correct location to match the scorpion onPillar 43 and its head faces to the right, whereas the head of the scorpion onthe pillar faces to the left. The scorpion on the pillar is also below thevulture, whereas modern Scorpio is a very large constellation lying parallel andto the right of Sagittarius. I suggest the solution to this problem is that thescorpion on Pillar 43 is conjured from a combination of the tail of the modernconstellation of Scorpio (right legs of the Pillar 43 scorpion), an unused partof the “Teapot” asterism of Sagittarius (right claw of the Pillar 43 scorpion)and the constellations that we know as Ara, Telescopium and Corona Australis(respectively the tail, left legs and left claw of the Pillar 43 scorpion).Meanwhile, as noted above, the claws and head of the modern constellation ofScorpio have been co-opted to form the chick with the hooked beak on Pillar 43.This whole issue of the relationship between the modern constellations ofScorpio and Sagittarius and the scorpion and vulture figures depicted on Pillar43 takes on a new level of significance when we remember that in some ancientastronomical figures Sagittarius is depicted not only as a centaur—aman-horse—but also as a man-horse hybrid with the tail of a scorpion, andsometimes simply as a man-scorpion hybrid.6 [part0122.html#chapter15-6] OnBabylonian Kudurru stones (often referred to as boundary stones, although it islikely that their function has been misunderstood7 [part0122.html#chapter15-7])a figure of a man-scorpion drawing a bow frequently appears that “is universallyidentified with the archer Sagittarius.”8 [part0122.html#chapter15-8] Whatfurther cements the identification of Sagittarius with the vulture on Pillar 43is that these man-scorpion figures from the Babylonian Kudurru stones are veryoften depicted with the legs and feet of birds.9 [part0122.html#chapter15-9]Moreover, in some representations a second scorpion appears beneath thebody—i.e. beneath the Teapot asterism—of Sagittarius,10[part0122.html#chapter15-10] reminiscent of the position of the scorpion onPillar 43 (see Figures 50 and 51).image [../images/00054.jpeg]Figure 51: Man-scorpion Sagittarius figures from Bablylonian Kudurru stones(left) are frequently depicted with the legs and feet of birds, furtherstrengthening the identification of the vulture figure on Pillar 43 withSagittarius. In other Mesopotamian representations (right) we see a secondscorpion beneath the body of Sagittarius occupying a similar position to thescorpion on Pillar 43.When all this is taken together it goes, in my opinion, far beyond anything thatcan be explained away as mere “coincidence.” The implication is that ideas ofhow certain constellations should be depicted that were expressed at GöbekliTepe almost 12,000 years ago, including the notion that there should be ascorpion in this region of the heavens, were passed down, undergoing somechanges in the process, but nonetheless surviving in recognizable form formillennia to find related expression in much later Babylonian astronomicaliconography. But given the close connections with ancient Mesopotamia, itsantediluvian cities, its Seven Sages and its flood survivors washed up in theirArk near Göbekli Tepe, we should perhaps not be too surprised.image [../images/00055.jpeg]Figure 52: Astronomer Giulio Magli notes of Pillar 43 at Göbekli Tepe (right)that the “bags” in the top register are similar to the “houses in the sky”occurring on much later Babylonian pillars (left).Last but not least, there’s the mystery of the three “bags” or “buckets” in theupper register of Pillar 43, which caught my eye on my first visit to GöbekliTepe and which are discussed in Chapter One. As astronomer Giulio Magli hasnoticed, these:three “bags” are pretty similar to the three “houses in the sky” occurring inthe much (very much!) later Babylonian Kudurru traditions.11[part0122.html#chapter15-11]What Magli calls the “houses in the sky” (again see accompanying illustrations)are the symbols of Mesopotamian deities, notably Enlil, who sent the Deluge todestroy mankind, and Enki, the god of wisdom who intervened to save us.12[part0122.html#chapter15-12] The reader will recall from Chapter Eight that itwas Enki who warned the patriarch Zisudra of the coming cataclysm and urged himto build the great Ark that would ultimately bring the flood survivors to theregion of Ararat so close to Göbekli Tepe. It’s hard to avoid the conclusionthat all these shared themes in the iconography of Mesopotamia as late as thefirst millenium BC, and of Göbekli Tepe as early as the tenth millenium BC, havemuch older antediluvian origins in a lost civilization that was the progenitorof both—and perhaps of many other cultures around the world—and that took pains,through deliberately engineered myths and wisdom traditions, and throughcarefully structured teachings passed on from generation to generation byinitiated Sages, to ensure that its memory would not be lost forever from theearth.The MayaLate into the night, as I work through the whole scenario in my hotel room inŞanlIurfa, my confidence in Burley’s case continues to grow. Once all thesurrounding context is taken into account, the vulture “holding the sun” on itsfront wing really does look like the figure of an ancient constellationrepresenting the Teapot asterism of the constellation of Sagittarius.This then raises the next part of the puzzle: when does the vulture/Sagittarius“hold the sun?” Burley makes clear that he believes the moment represented onPillar 43 still lay far in the future when Göbekli Tepe was built—indeed 11,600years in the future, i.e. in our own time, the epoch of 2012. And he comes tothis conclusion because it is only in our epoch, specifically in the 80-yearwindow from 1960 to 2040, that the sun on December 21, the winter solstice, notonly sits over the outstretched front wing of the bird (i.e. over the spout ofthe “teapot” in the modern conception of this asterism) but also targets the“nuclear bulge” and the dark rift at the center of the Milky Way galaxy. So,arguably, this is a very significant astronomical moment that is symbolized onPillar 43.Very significant indeed, as it turns out, because it is also this exact same80-year window (where the year 2012 falls just a little after the midpoint) thatis signaled in the famous—or perhaps it would now be better to sayinfamous—Mayan calendar. A great deal of nonsense was talked about thatcalendar, and particularly about the December 21, 2012 date, which many wronglytook to be something absolute and precise, when in reality it was always an“indication date” and nothing more.In getting to grips with this mystery, it is only the astronomy that counts—andnaked-eye astronomy at that. We are not talking about radio telescopes orastrophysics here. With regard to the naked-eye astronomy of the ancient Maya,the real scholars of this subject, among whom there is none more pre-eminentthan John Major Jenkins, made valiant efforts—for a long while before 2012—toteach us that what the end date of the Mayan calendar was based on was in factthe once-in-26,000-years conjunction of the winter solstice sun with the centerof the galaxy, i.e. with the dark rift and nuclear bulge of the Milky Way.Because of the diameter of the sun and the limitations of naked-eye astronomythis conjunction cannot be pinned down to an exact year but is best considered,as I’ve indicated here, as a window 80-years wide spanning the period 1960–2040.As an artifact of precession, the winter solstice sun was moving slowly andsteadily toward its conjunction with the center of the galaxy for thousands ofyears before 2012—and in his books, going back at least as far as MayaCosmogenesis, which he published in 1998, John Major Jenkins made this eminentlyclear. Diagrams that he offered to his readers showed the journey of the wintersolstice sun from 3000 BC, when it was 70 degrees away from the dark-riftcrossing point in Sagittarius, through the time of Christ when it had halved thedistance that remained for it to travel, to the epoch of 2012 (that 80-yearwindow between 1960 and 2040) when it most closely conjuncts the dark rift, andonward to AD 5000 when it will have moved 70 degrees past the dark rift.13[part0122.html#chapter15-13]More than this, Jenkins meticulously documented why the conjunction of thewinter solstice sun with the dark rift in the central bulge of the Milky Way wasimportant in Mayan cosmology—because this was the region of the heavens that theMaya thought of as “the place of creation” with the central bulge viewed as “thewomb or birthplace of the sky”:The Maya understood this dense, bright bulge as a Cosmic Center and CreationPlace, a conclusion based solely on naked-eye observation that is, in fact, verytrue: the center of our saucer-shaped galaxy lies within this bright and widepart of the Milky Way … that hyperdense region out of which the Milky Way andeverything in it, including us, has poured.14 [part0122.html#chapter15-14]It is not my purpose here to go in depth into the whole enigma of the Mayancalendar, not least since I wrote about this subject at some length inFingerprints of the Gods.15 [part0122.html#chapter15-15] However, myunderstanding since the publication of Fingerprints in 1995 has moved on, and itis important to be clear that in signaling the decades around 2012 as the end ofa great cycle, the Maya were not speaking of the end of the world, as such, butrather of the end of an age—“a time of great transformation and world rebirth”16[part0122.html#chapter15-16]—that would be followed by the beginning of a newgreat cycle or world age. This, in the Mayan scheme of things, is the turbulentand dangerous time of transition we live in today. It is therefore strange, andindeed somewhat eerie, to find the solar and astronomical coordinates of theexact same 80-year window between 1960 and 2040 prophesied by the Maya to mark aturning point in human history, carved in high relief on a 12,000-year-oldpillar in Göbekli Tepe in far-off Turkey.Eliminating the impossibleI want to be sure that I could be right to read some kind of prediction orprophecy for our age, some sort of notification, some sort of message sentspecifically to us, in the reliefs on Pillar 43. Before even beginning toconsider what that message might speak of, the first step is to confirm thatPaul Burley’s discovery is a solid one.I’m already persuaded by his identification of Sagittarius with the vulture andof the disc held up by its wing with the sun. The general context of thesurrounding constellations is also an excellent fit. Could it be, however, thatthe reliefs on the pillar do indeed depict the sun’s conjunction withSagittarius and the center of the Milky Way, but at some time other than thewinter solstice in the years between 1960 and 2040?Of course, the winter solstice alignment recurs once every 26,000 years, so in24,000 BC the sun would have been seen in Sagittarius, targeting the center ofthe galaxy exactly as it does today, and this rare alignment will happen again26,000 years from now, i.e. in AD 28,000. It’s not impossible that anyhypothetical message could be to do with these remote dates.It’s intriguing, however, that there’s another “message,” from a completelydifferent culture—the ancient Maya—that uses the same system of coordinates andthat is indeed focused, very exactly, on the years between 1960 and 2040.Meanwhile at Göbekli Tepe there are also the other three key moments of the yearto consider—the summer solstice and the two equinoxes. Was there any alignmentthrough Sagittarius with the center of the galaxy at any of these three other“stations of the sun” in the epoch of 9600 BC when Göbekli Tepe was built?I know from my work on Ancient Egypt that the sun was in Leo on the springequinox in 10,800 BC. Now a few moments on the computer confirm that thisremained the case 1,200 years later; in 9600 BC the equinox sun was still in Leoand was thus at a point on its ecliptic path that was very far from anyalignment with the center of the galaxy. I feel quite safe, therefore, in rulingout the spring equinox, at least in that epoch.image [../images/00056.jpeg]Figure 53: Spring equinox sunrise at Göbekli Tepe, 9600 BCThe same is also true for the autumn equinox in 9600 BC. Because the sun wasthen in the constellation of Aquarius, and again very far from alignment withthe center of the galaxy, I rule it out too.image [../images/00057.jpeg]Figure 54: Autumn equinox sunrise at Göbekli Tepe, 9600 BCMoreover, after reminding myself of the orientation of all the enclosures atGöbekli Tepe, it becomes clear that the equinoxes can be ruled out in allperiods. This is the case because all of the four major enclosures, A, B, C andD—remember Pillar 43 is in Enclosure D—have a very definite northwest tosoutheast orientation.17 [part0122.html#chapter15-17] None of them come anywherenear to due east where the equinox sun rises, or due west where the equinox sunsets. If the builders of Göbekli Tepe had wished to direct our attention toeither of the equinoxes in a piece of symbolic art like Pillar 43, their veryfirst step would have been to provide an obvious clue by aligning the site eastto west. Since they did not do so, it is safe to assume that events at theequinoxes were not what they had in mind.This leaves us with the solstices. The sun rises south of east and sets south ofwest on the winter solstice. On the summer solstice it rises north of east andsets north of west. In theory, therefore, sunrise alignments (south of east) onthe winter solstice and sunset alignments (north of west) on the summer solsticecan be considered as relevant to the northwest to southeast orientation ofGöbekli Tepe.As we’ve seen, a winter solstice alignment involving the sun, Sagittarius, andthe center of the galaxy can be ruled out for 9600 BC, since that alignment onlyoccurs in our own epoch, or in 24,000 BC or in AD 28,000. On the winter solsticein 9600 BC the sun was in Taurus and very far from alignment with the center ofthe galaxy. A summer solstice sunrise alignment north of east can also be ruledout, not only in 9600 BC but in all epochs, given the site’s distinct southeastto northwest orientation.image [../images/00058.jpeg]Figure 55: Winter solstice sunrise at Göbekli Tepe, 9600 BCimage [../images/00059.jpeg]Figure 56: Summer solstice sunrise at Göbekli Tepe, 9600 BCBy a process of deduction, therefore, we are left with only one possiblealignment that might work in 9600 BC and this is to the summer solstice sunset,north of west, which presents no conflict to the general southeast to northwestorientation of Göbekli Tepe. Moreover, computer simulations show that on thesummer solstice in the epoch of 9600 BC the sun was in the constellation ofScorpio and while it did not align with the center of the galaxy (having movedpast the dark rift and the nuclear bulge), it was still reasonably close to thattarget. As the reader will recall, Sagittarius and Scorpio straddle the darkrift and the nuclear bulge but it is in Sagittarius, not Scorpio, that the exactalignment with the center of the galaxy occurs. Nonetheless, it seems reasonableto accept the summer solstice sunset, north of west, in the epoch of 9600 BC asa candidate for the scene depicted on Pillar 43. A relatively minor error ofdraftsmanship by the sculptor who carved the figures would, in theory, be enoughto explain the discrepancy.There is, however, a difficulty which Andrew Collins, his colleague Rodney Hale,and the mathematicians Alessandro de Lorenzis and Vincenzo Orofino all seem tohave missed in their focus on possible alignments toward the northwest,specifically to the setting of the star Deneb in the constellation of Cygnus,reviewed in the last chapter. Deneb did indeed set north of west in the epoch of9600 BC in alignment with the orientation of Enclosure D but this alignment,though accurate enough, was purely theoretical and could never in fact have beenobserved from Enclosure D, for the simple reason that Enclosure D is built intothe side of the steep ridge of the Tepe that rises to the north of the maingroup of enclosures. No observation of the setting of Deneb would have beenpossible from Enclosure D and for the same reason no observation of the summersolstice sunset would have been possible. The sun would have dropped out ofsight behind the ridge for approximately twenty minutes before it actually setand in order to observe its setting, it would have been necessary to leaveEnclosure D and climb the ridge.For this reason, therefore, combined with the fact that the sun in Scorpio,while close, does not target the center of the galaxy, a summer solstice sunsetalignment must also be ruled out.“When you have eliminated the impossible,” Arthur Conan Doyle’s characterSherlock Holmes famously pronounced, then “whatever remains, however improbable,must be the truth.” By a process of elimination we have seen that Göbekli Tepecannot be inviting us to consider the equinoxes, and nor can it be inviting usto consider the summer solstice, even at the favorable moment of sunset. Thisleaves us only with the winter solstice with the sun in Sagittarius targetingthe center of the Milky Way galaxy, the definitive astronomical signature of theyears between 1960 and 2040 in our own epoch—a signature that recurs only at26,000-year intervals. However improbable it may seem, therefore, we are obligedto consider the possibility that in 9600 BC the builders of Göbekli Tepe werealready so advanced in their knowledge of the recondite phenomenon of precessionthat they were able to calculate its effects for thousands of years backward andforward in time in order to produce an accurate symbolic picture of theSagittarius/winter solstice conjunction.If this speculation is correct then it is appropriate to remind ourselves thattwo comparable scientific achievements of prehistoric antiquity have alsosurvived the ages and come down to us in the same degree of completeness.One is the Mayan calendar that envisaged a great cycle in the life of the worldcoming to an end in exactly the same 80-year period between 1960 and 2040.Moreover, it used exactly the same yardstick—the progress of the winter solsticesun toward alignment with the center of our galaxy—to predict when the fatefulconjunction would occur and to define the cusp between the end of the old ageand the beginning of the new.The other is the grand astronomical geoglyph of Egypt’s Giza plateau, inscribedon the west bank of the Nile in the forms of the Great Pyramids and the GreatSphinx. The reader will recall that these masterpieces of megalithicarchitecture deploy a deep knowledge of precession to offer us a picture of thesky on the spring equinox in 10,800 BC. Here, too, as we shall see in ChapterNineteen, there are the distinctive characteristics of a message, a message sentacross the ages and directed, quite specifically, at our time and at us.In our search to discover what these messages might mean, perhaps the Sabians ofHarran, those “star-worshippers” whose city lies barely 25 miles from GöbekliTepe, those followers of the wisdom god with their mysterious pilgrimages to thePyramids of Giza, will be able to give us a clue."},{"pageContent":" Chapter 16 [part0131.html#c_ch16]Written in the Stars [part0131.html#c_ch16]In Chapters Eight to Eleven we explored the secret tradition of the Sages,maintained in Egypt for thousands of years, perpetuating itself throughrecruitment and initiation down the ages. And we considered the possibility thatthese “mystery teachers of heaven,” these “Followers of Horus”—these “Magiciansof the Gods”—played a key role, not once but many times, at crucial moments inEgyptian history, in moving that remarkable culture forward.In Chapter Twelve we looked into the connection between the incrediblemegalithic site of Baalbek and an enigmatic group of colonists from ancientCanaan who settled near Egypt’s Giza plateau, where they made regular devotionalofferings to the Great Sphinx, named by them variously as Hauron or Hurna aftera Canaanite falcon deity.In Chapter Fourteen we saw that another group, known as the Sabians and renownedas “star-worshippers,” came from even further away as pilgrims to the Pyramidsof Giza. Their home city was Harran, located near Göbekli Tepe in what is nowsoutheastern Turkey. There is no record of when these pilgrimages began butHarran had already been settled for thousands of years1[part0123.html#chapter16-1] when the earliest surviving written reference to itappears in an inscription dated to around 2000 BC.2 [part0123.html#chapter16-2]What is remarkable is that Sabian pilgrimages to Giza were still taking place aslate as AD 1228 when the Arab geographer Yakut el-Hamawi mentioned them in hisMo’gam-el-Buldan (“Dictionary of Countries”). As Egyptologist Selim Hassan notesin the passage quoted in Chapter Fourteen, Hamawi’s account shows that theSabians “fully recognized the Pyramids of Khufu and Khafre as being monumentsconnected with the stellar cult.”3 [part0123.html#chapter16-3]image [../images/00060.jpeg]Figure 57This may seem like a small point, and “experts” on the Sabians have ignored it,but it proves the continuation of a hidden tradition. Ancient Egyptian religionand Ancient Egyptian culture ceased to exist hundreds of years before AD 1228(the last known inscription in sacred hieroglyphs dates to AD 394), whileEgyptologists did not rediscover the evidence of the stellar nature of thePyramid “cult” until the early 1900s.4 [part0123.html#chapter16-4] There is,therefore, no way other than a hidden tradition that the Sabian“star-worshippers” could have known the Pyramids were connected to the stars orcould have been motivated to make them objects of pilgrimage.Ah but Harran … Harran—the fabled city of the Sabians. What a lowly mess it istoday. Fashioned from mud-brick, a few of the traditional beehive-shaped housesstill survive, grouped together into a center retailing trinkets for theamusement of tourists. The ramshackle modern town is located in the midst of avast, desolate plain with the ridges of the Taurus mountains, blue and hazy,looming 25 miles (40 kilometers) to the north. Göbekli Tepe stands on one ofthose ridges, and indeed the two sites are theoretically intervisible5[part0123.html#chapter16-5]—in other words, if your eyes were good enough, youcould see Göbekli Tepe from Harran, and vice versa.What would have made such a sighting easier, in antiquity, would have been atall tower annexed to the temple that once stood here—a temple dedicated toSu-En (usually contracted to Sin), the Moon God of the Sabians.6[part0123.html#chapter16-6] After telling us that there were “powerful images inthis temple,” the Greek Philosopher Libanius (AD 314–394), describes the tower,noting that “from its top one could overlook the entire plain of Harran.”7[part0123.html#chapter16-7]The Temple of the Moon God was already remotely ancient in the first milleniumBC, when we know from inscriptions that several restorations were required. Forexample, repairs were carried out on it by the Assyrian King Shalamensar III(859–824 BC), and by Ashurbanipal (685–627 BC). Later, Nabonidus, who ruled theNeo-Babylonian Empire from 556–539 BC, rebuilt the temple.8[part0123.html#chapter16-8] Like Thutmosis IV of Egypt, who restored the GreatSphinx of Giza (see Chapter Ten), Nabonidus was inspired by a dream to undertakethis work.9 [part0123.html#chapter16-9]It is a remarkable thing that the “pagan” religion of Harran survived forseveral hundred years into the Islamic era. This owed much to the acceptance ofthe Sabians as a “people of the book” (the reader will recall from ChapterFourteen that they successfully claimed Hermes as their prophet and offered acompilation of the Hermetic texts as their Scriptures). Thus when the Arabgeneral Ibn Ghanam conquered Harran in the seventh century AD, he co-opted thesite where stood the Temple of the Moon God, with its fabulous tower, for theconstruction of a Grand Mosque. It seems that the temple was destroyed to makeway for the mosque, but that Ghanam offered the Sabians an alternative site inthe city where they were permitted to build a new temple.10[part0123.html#chapter16-10] They continued to practice their “star-worship”there, without significant disruption, until the eleventh century AD, wheneither in 1032, or in 1081—accounts are conflicting—a new generation of Muslimrulers turned against them, suppressed their faith and destroyed their lasttemple.11 [part0123.html#chapter16-11]Two centuries later the Mongol invasions began and Harran was frequently thescene of fierce conflicts. In a succession of episodes in 1259, 1262 and 1271,the city’s Islamic places of worship were destroyed.12[part0123.html#chapter16-12] The Grand Mosque still lies in ruins today, butwhen we remember that the Temple of the Moon God once stood here under a loftytower, it’s curious that the one almost intact architectural remnant, with asquare base measuring only 4 meters (13 feet) on each side, stands more than 50meters (164 feet) tall and overlooks the Harran plain, just as its Sabianpredecessor did. No doubt it is merely a surviving minaret of Ibn Ghanam’s GrandMosque—the architecture is definitely Islamic. Still it is thought-provoking, tosay the least, that local people refer to it to this day as the “AstronomicalTower,” as though preserving an ancient memory of the time when their Sabianancestors climbed the long-vanished spire of the Temple of the Moon God toobserve the heavens.The few archaeological expeditions mounted in Harran from the 1950s onward,while finding a number of inscriptions relating to the Moon God, have as yetrevealed no physical traces of the pre-Islamic temples.13[part0123.html#chapter16-13] A team from the Chicago Oriental Institute wasabout to start a major dig around the ruins of the Grand Mosque in 1986, but itseems that the Turkish authorities insisted on such restrictive practices thatthe project had to be abandoned.14 [part0123.html#chapter16-14] Currentexcavations by Harran University and the ŞanlIurfa Museum Directorate showlittle interest in recovery of substantive remains from the city’s pre-Islamicperiod.15 [part0123.html#chapter16-15]Thus far, based on the minimal archaeology done, datable artifacts from Harranitself go back to around 5000 BC,16 [part0123.html#chapter16-16] though there isevery possibility that older remains will be found with further excavations. Ata settlement mound called Asagi Yarimca, a few kilometers northwest of the city,characteristic Halaf monochrome wares dating to 6000 BC have been collected.17[part0123.html#chapter16-17] And six kilometers south of Harran, excavationssince 2006 by Turkish archaeologist Nurettin Yardimci have established theexistence of an even older permanent settlement dated to 8000 BC.18[part0123.html#chapter16-18]Since 8000 BC—10,000 years ago—marks the approximate epoch in which Göbekli Tepewas abandoned and the last of its stone circles deliberately buried, I wasintrigued to learn that the site of Yardimci’s excavations has been known sincetime immemorial as Tell Idris—i.e. “the settlement mound of Idris.” This isinteresting, because Idris, in the Koran, is the name of the Biblical prophetEnoch, the seventh of the ten patriarchs who lived in the times before theFlood.19 [part0123.html#chapter16-19] To be specific, Enoch is the son of Jared,the father of Methuselah, the grandfather of Lamech, and the great-grandfatherof Noah himself.20 [part0123.html#chapter16-20] Moreover, Muslim traditionsassociate Idris/Enoch with Hermes.21 [part0123.html#chapter16-21] The PersianIslamic philosopher Abu Mashar (AD 787–886) expresses the matter as follows:The name Hermes is a title. Its first bearer, who lived before the Flood, was …he whom the Hebrews call Enoch, whose name in Arabic is Idris. The Harraniansdeclare his prophethood.22 [part0123.html#chapter16-22]This antediluvian Enoch/Idris/Hermes was a master of the sciences, “especiallyastronomy.” In addition:He wrote many books, whose wisdom he preserved on the walls of Egyptian templeslest it be lost. It was he who constructed the pyramids.23[part0123.html#chapter16-23]Abu Mashar’s comments contain strong echoes of the Edfu Building Texts, alsosupposedly derived from lost antediluvian books and inscribed on the walls ofthe Temple of Horus to ensure that their message would not be lost. And thesense here that the pyramids are remotely ancient and were built by Hermes—that“master of astronomy,” the Egyptian Thoth, as the reader will recall—findsresonance with the tradition of the “number of the secret chambers of thesanctuary of Thoth,” reported in Chapter Eleven, which, in historic times, thePharaoh Khufu wished to consult and copy in his own construction works at Giza.Once again, confronted by such material, it doesn’t seem unreasonable to supposethat we may have stumbled across the traces of a project, set in motion by thesurvivors of a global flood cataclysm, to bring about “the resurrection of theformer world of the gods.” Wherever this project took root, it seems to me, itsessence was a tradition, passed down from generation to generation by initiatedmasters and thus theoretically capable of implementation in any place, and inany epoch, when the time was right.With their ability to blend in and survive changing circumstances, with theirknowledge of the astronomical qualities of the pyramids preserved until as leastas late as the thirteenth century AD, and with their very name, as Selim Hassanrightly recognized, derived from Sba, the Ancient Egyptian word for “star,”24[part0123.html#chapter16-24] the Sabians of Harran have all the hallmarks ofcarriers of the secret tradition.Mystery of the WatchersApart from his genealogy in the line of patriarchs before Noah, and theenigmatic statements that he “walked with God” and was mysteriously “taken up”by God without experiencing death,25 [part0123.html#chapter16-25] the canonicalBible has nothing else to tell us about Enoch. Happily much more information isavailable in several ancient non-canonical works—i.e. works that Biblicalredactors for one reason or another chose not to include within the officiallysanctioned scriptures. Of these the most famous by far is the Book of Enoch.Prior to the eighteenth century, scholars had believed it to be irretrievablylost. Composed long before the birth of Christ,26 [part0123.html#chapter16-26]and considered to be one of the most important pieces of Jewish mysticalliterature, it was only known from fragments and from references to it in othertexts. All this changed, however, after polymath adventurer James Bruce ofKinnaird visited Ethiopia in the years 1770–72. Among other remarkableachievements there,27 [part0123.html#chapter16-27] he procured and brought backto Britain several copies of the Book of Enoch that, in antiquity, had beentranslated into Ge’ez, the Ethiopic sacred language. These were the firstcomplete copies ever to be seen in Europe.28 [part0123.html#chapter16-28]I note in passing that the Book of Enoch has always been of great significanceto Freemasonry. Indeed, certain Masonic rituals—in curious resonance withIslamic traditions—identify Enoch with the Ancient Egyptian wisdom god Thoth andalso with his Greek avatar Hermes.29 [part0123.html#chapter16-29] An entry inThe Royal Masonic Cyclopedia, first published in 1877, tells us that Enoch wasthe inventor of writing, that “he taught men the art of building,” and that,before the Flood, he “feared that the real secrets would be lost—to preventwhich he concealed the Grand Secret, engraven on a white oriental porphyrystone, in the bowels of the earth.”30 [part0123.html#chapter16-30] TheCyclopedia contains its own hint of a secret tradition transmitted down theages, when it further suggests that Enoch was himself a Freemason and that atthe end of his days on earth “he delivered up the Grand Master’s office toLamech.”31 [part0123.html#chapter16-31]The Book of Enoch is a very strange document, purporting, among many otherelements, to be a vision of the future cataclysm of the Flood, and why it is tobe unleashed upon the world. In a series of dreams,32[part0123.html#chapter16-32] Enoch receives advance notice of the warning thatGod will give to his descendant Noah that “a deluge is about to come upon thewhole earth, and destroy all that is on it.”33 [part0123.html#chapter16-33]This, of course, is familiar ground—merely a précis, or restatement, of what wecan read in Genesis. So, too, is the passage that follows in which Enoch isgiven to understand that arrangements will be made for Noah to escape so that“his seed may be preserved for all the generations of the world.”34[part0123.html#chapter16-34]What comes next is intriguing. Regardless of the fact that the express purposeof God’s Deluge is to kill off most of mankind—apart, of course, from Noah andhis descendants—there is talk of the need to:heal the earth which the angels have corrupted … that all the children of menmay not perish through all the secret things which the Watchers have disclosedand have taught their sons.35 [part0123.html#chapter16-35]This is only the second mention of these mysterious “Watchers” in the Book ofEnoch. The first, a few pages earlier, tells us nothing about them except thatthey “shall quake” at the prospect of the coming events.36[part0123.html#chapter16-36] So far we have no real clue as to who or what theyare except that they have transgressed some divine law by teaching “secretthings”—apparently dangerous things—to humanity, and that they (and most of thehuman race through the agency of the Deluge) are to be punished grievouslybecause of this.Certain names of the Watchers, or at any rate the leadership of the Watchers,are given—Azazel, Semjaza, Armen, Rumjal, Turel, Armaros, Danjal, Kokabel andabout a dozen more.37 [part0123.html#chapter16-37] More specifically, we’re toldabout the nature of the “secret things” that they taught to mankind:And Azazel taught men to make swords and knives, and shields, and breastplates,and made known to them the metals of the earth, and the art of working them, andbracelets, and ornaments, and the use of antimony, and the beautifying of theeyelids, and all kinds of costly stones, and all coloring tinctures. And therearose much godlessness, and they committed fornication, and they were ledastray, and became corrupt in all their ways. Semjaza taught enchantments, androot-cuttings, Armaros the resolving of enchantments, Baraquijal taughtastrology, Kokabel the constellations, Ezequeel the knowledge of the clouds,Araquiel the signs of the earth, Shamsiel the signs of the sun, and Sariel thecourse of the moon …38 [part0123.html#chapter16-38]Next we begin to understand that the Watchers are divided into two mutuallyopposed groups, because we read that the leaders of one group summonEnoch—remember this is all happening to him while he is in a dreamlike,visionary state—to deliver a message to the leaders of the other group, named as“the Watchers of the heaven.”39 [part0123.html#chapter16-39] It seems these“Watchers of the heaven” (sometimes also referred to as “the heavenlyWatchers”40 [part0123.html#chapter16-40]) have “defiled themselves with women,and have done as the children of the earth do, and have taken unto themselveswives.”41 [part0123.html#chapter16-41] They have also “wrought great destructionupon the earth.”42 [part0123.html#chapter16-42] For this they are going to bepunished in various deeply unpleasant and terrifying ways.43[part0123.html#chapter16-43]Obedient and dutiful, Enoch sets off, bearing his heavy message of murder andmayhem from the Watchers to … the Watchers.So what’s going on here?A more careful scan of the pages reveals the backstory:And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in those dayswere born unto them beautiful and comely daughters. And the angels, the childrenof heaven, saw and lusted after them, and said to one another, “Come, let uschoose us wives from among the children of men and beget us children.” AndSemjaza, who was their leader, said unto them: “I fear ye will not indeed agreeto do this deed, and I alone shall have to pay the penalty of a great sin.” Andthey all answered him and said: “Let us all swear an oath, and all bindourselves by mutual imprecations not to abandon this plan but to do this thing.”Then sware they all together and bound themselves by mutual imprecations uponit. And they were in all two hundred, who descended in the days of Jared on thesummit of Mount Hermon …44 [part0123.html#chapter16-44]Now things are becoming clearer. “Watchers” is a general term referring toangels. Among them are bad angels. They want to have sex and make babies withbeautiful human women and while they’re at it, as we can gather from passagesquoted earlier, they’re going to teach mankind a thing or two about metals, andthe constellations and the course of the sun and the moon (or the ecliptic asthis “course”—this “path”—is known to astronomers today). As the first step inimplementing their plan these bad Watchers descend upon Mount Hermon, whichhappens to be in ancient Canaan, now Lebanon, and only 45 miles (73 kilometers)from Baalbek.Meanwhile there are good angels, “the Holy Angels who watch”45[part0123.html#chapter16-45]—among them Uriel, Raphael, Raguel, Michael,Saraquel, Gabriel and Remiel.46 [part0123.html#chapter16-46] And it’s these goodWatcher angels who appear to Enoch in a dream and give him that message of deathand destruction to take to the bad Watcher angels on Mount Hermon. He tells usspecifically where he received this dream:I went off and sat down at the waters of Dan, to the south of the west ofHermon … I fell asleep and behold a dream came to me and visions fell down uponme and I saw visions of chastisement and a voice came bidding me to tell it tothe sons of heaven and reprimand them. And when I awakened I came unto them …47[part0123.html#chapter16-47]As I read these passages, set before the Flood, when the people of Lebanon andancient Turkey were still at the hunter-gatherer stage of development, it seemsmore and more obvious to me that Enoch is a shamanic figure. And like allshamans, everywhere, in all times and places, he sets great store byvisions—which in his case come in the form of dreams received “in sleep.” What’sinteresting, however, is that when he wakes up from this visionary state, he’sable to go to a real physical place on Mount Hermon where the bad Watchers areand talk to them face to face:And I recounted before them all the visions which I had seen in sleep, and Ibegan to speak the words of righteousness, and to reprimand the heavenlyWatchers.48 [part0123.html#chapter16-48]Does this not suggest, rather strongly, that the bad Watchers are physicalbeings? I don’t know what the good Watchers are, because they only appear toEnoch in his dreams. Quite possibly they are real at some level. Readers of mybook Supernatural, which is about shamanism, will know my view that in alteredstates of consciousness (including dream states) the “receiver wavelength” ofthe brain may be retuned allowing us to make contact with other dimensions ofreality.49 [part0123.html#chapter16-49] But in Enoch’s story the bad Watchersmust be real—real on the earthly plane of physical existence—because when hewakes up he’s able to climb Mount Hermon and reprimand them.We must also entertain the possibility that the bad Watchers—whoever or whateverthey are—may not in fact be bad. All we can say is that they are judged to bebad and portrayed as bad in Enoch’s dream-visions. One possibility that weshould keep in mind, alongside the alternative possibility that the “Book ofEnoch” is just an ancient work of fantasy fiction, is that Enoch’s encounterswith the “bad” Watchers really did happen and that he hated and resented themfor changes they were seeking to introduce to the hunter-gatherer way of life ofhis people. In that case the reprimands he delivers to them, mediated throughhis subconscious as coming from the good Watchers, may simply express his owndeeply entrenched views, the views of a bigoted old shaman who feels threatenedby change—even though he himself will later be transformed by his contacts withthe Watchers.There isn’t space here to review the entire, bizarre, impenetrable, wildlysuggestive text of the Book of Enoch. What I’m interested in is the much morespecific possibility that the two hundred Watchers who “descended” on MountHermon were indeed real beings, not phantasms. I’d like to understand more aboutwhat kind of beings they could have been. And I want to look at the pictureEnoch paints of them, laden with hatred and resentment though it is, as bringingskills and sciences to our ancestors—skills and sciences which, ultimately, willalso be revealed to him by the good Watchers, and with which his own name willcome to be associated in legend and tradition.50 [part0123.html#chapter16-50]Mystery of the NephilimThe Watchers begin their development project in quite small ways, teaching“charms and enchantments, and the cutting of roots” to humans, and making them“acquainted with plants.”51 [part0123.html#chapter16-51] This sounds fairlyharmless; apart from a bit of “enchantment,” it’s not really above and beyondbasic hunter-gatherer level skills. But pretty soon, as we saw earlier, ourancestors are being initiated into the secrets of metals, and how to make swordsand knives, and how to study the heavens—and also how to beautify themselveswith eye-makeup and jewelry.In return (a bit like the GIs who allegedly bought favors from British womenwith gifts of nylon stockings, cigarettes and chewing gum during World WarII),52 [part0123.html#chapter16-52] the Watchers are getting sex—lots ofsex!—and it seems this is what annoys Enoch the most. He speaks reprovingly,again and again, of the “fornication” of the Watchers,53[part0123.html#chapter16-53] of their “lust” for “beautiful and comely” humanwomen54 [part0123.html#chapter16-54] who they “sleep with,”55[part0123.html#chapter16-55] “go into”56 [part0123.html#chapter16-56] and“defile themselves” with,57 [part0123.html#chapter16-57] and to whom they reveal“all kinds of sins.”58 [part0123.html#chapter16-58]From such admonishments we may reasonably deduce a number of things about theWatchers, most particularly that they must be about the right size and shape,and equipped, moreover, with the necessary organs and impulses to want, to haveand to enjoy sex with human women. To me, the obvious conclusion from this isthe Watchers are in fact human, or at any rate extremely closely related at thegenetic level to anatomically modern human beings—close enough, indeed, to makehuman women pregnant and to have “children of fornication”59[part0123.html#chapter16-59] with them. These offspring are not sickly as onemight expect from an even slightly mismatched genetic makeup. On the contrary,they thrive so vigorously that Enoch, or the “good” angels speaking through him,want not only to destroy the Watchers but also to “destroy the children of theWatchers.”60 [part0123.html#chapter16-60]But there is something very odd about the hybrid offspring, at least if we takeEnoch’s word for it, because he tells us that when human women “became pregnant”by the Watchers they gave birth to:great giants whose height was three thousand ells, who consumed all theacquisitions of men. And when men could no longer sustain them, the giantsturned against them and devoured mankind.61 [part0123.html#chapter16-61]Three thousand ells is equivalent to 4,500 feet or 1,371 meters. Whatever thetruth behind this account may be, therefore, it’s obvious the angry old shamanis embellishing it fantastically here in his bid to discredit the Watchers. Theprospect of human women giving birth to babies who would grow to more than akilometer in height is patently absurd. Nonetheless, it brings us back tofamiliar Biblical territory again—indeed to one of the more notorious passagesin the Book of Genesis which reads:And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, anddaughters were born unto them, that the sons of God saw the daughters of menthat they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. And theLord said, “My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also isflesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.” There were giants inthe earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in untothe daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty menwhich were of old, men of renown.62 [part0123.html#chapter16-62]That’s the King James Version (I’ve added the emphasis in the final lines), butother translations give the original word Nephilim, that the KJV translates as“giants,” and we read:The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons ofGod went to the daughters of humans, and had children by them. They were theheroes of old, men of renown.63 [part0123.html#chapter16-63]So now further clarity begins to emerge. A group of bad angels, “Watchers of theheaven,” have come to earth—“descended,” specifically, on Mount Hermon inLebanon—transferred some technology, mated with human females, and producedoffspring who are in some way gigantic and are called Nephilim. Here’s whatwe’re told in the very next verses:The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth,and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil allthe time. The Lord regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and hisheart was deeply troubled. So the Lord said, “I will wipe from the face of theearth the human race I have created—and with them the animals, the birds and thecreatures that move along the ground—for I regret that I have made them.” ButNoah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.64 [part0123.html#chapter16-64]An amazing amount of credulous nonsense has proliferated around these verses inrecent years on the internet, much of it deriving from the late ZechariaSitchin’s science-fiction novels, notably the Earth Chronicles series, which hesuccessfully passed off to the public as serious factual studies. I’ve alreadytouched in Chapter Thirteen on Sitchin’s misrepresentation of Baalbek and whileI’m not saying that everything he wrote was fiction—he did throw in some quitevaluable and interesting facts—his overall body of work is marred by enoughblatant fabrications and fantasy to call for caution, rather than immediate,trusting acceptance, on the part of his readers.His treatment of the subject of the Nephilim (he spells the word Nefilim, butthis is not important) is a case in point. Claiming to be an expert in Biblicallanguages he asks:What then does the term Nefilim mean? Stemming from the Semitic root NFL (“to becast down”), it means exactly what it says. It means those who were cast downupon earth!65 [part0123.html#chapter16-65]The problem, however, as Michael S. Heiser, a genuine Biblical scholar andancient Semitic languages expert, has conclusively demonstrated, is that:Sitchin assumes “nephilim” comes from the Hebrew word “naphal” which usuallymeans “to fall.” He then forces the meaning “to come down” onto the word,creating his “to come down from above” translation. In the form we find it inthe Hebrew Bible, if the word nephilim came from Hebrew naphal, it would not bespelled as we find it. The form nephilim cannot mean “fallen ones” (the spellingwould then be nephulim). Likewise nephilim does not mean “those who fall” or“those who fall away” (that would be nophelim). The only way in Hebrew to getnephilim from naphal by the rules of Hebrew morphology (word formation) would beto presume a noun spelled naphil and then pluralise it. I say “presume” sincethis noun does not exist in biblical Hebrew—unless one counts Genesis 6:4 andNumbers 13:33, the two occurrences of nephilim—but that would then be assumingwhat one is trying to prove! However, in Aramaic the noun naphil(a) does exist.It means “giant,” making it easy to see why the Septuagint (the ancient Greektranslation of the Hebrew Bible) translated nephilim as gigantes (“giant”).66[part0123.html#chapter16-66]Heiser is plainly right about this because, as he points out, there is a laterpassage in the Old Testament, in Numbers 13, where the word Nephilim appearsagain. This is thousands of years after the Deluge, indeed in the historicalperiod, surely not later than 1200 BC, when the Israelites first entered Canaanafter the Exodus from Egypt. Advance scouts report to Moses:All the people we saw there are of great size. We saw the Nephilim there … Weseemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them.67[part0123.html#chapter16-67]The context leaves no room for doubt that the Nephilim are people of “greatsize,” the references to them as “giants” in the King James and other versionsof the Bible therefore make complete sense, and the “translation” that Sitchingives is obviously bogus. Did he know it was bogus even as he retailed it in hisbooks? There can be no certainty because, as Heiser goes on to prove, Sitchin’sgrasp of Biblical languages was so weak that he was unable to distinguishAramaic from Hebrew.68 [part0123.html#chapter16-68] The notion that the Nephilimwere beings who were “cast down from heaven,” or who “came down from heaven,”was deployed by Sitchin, Heiser believes, simply because it served his argumentand allowed him to “make the nephilim sound like ancient astronauts.”69[part0123.html#chapter16-69]Again the criticism is justified because Sitchin goes beyond what could be aninnocent error to give further “translations” of the word Nephilim that are evenmore self-serving and phoney. For example, he makes them “Gods of Heaven uponEarth,”70 [part0123.html#chapter16-70] and, worse still, “the People of theRocket Ships”71 [part0123.html#chapter16-71]—an interpretation for which thereis no possible justification in any ancient text but that allows him to speak,among other egregious and deceptive fictions, of “the Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration of the Nefilim.”72 [part0123.html#chapter16-72]It is also important, while reviewing this material which has had such an impacton public perceptions of the past, to be clear that the Watchers, who are nevermentioned at all in the Bible, but are said in the Book of Enoch to havedescended from heaven, are quite distinct from the Nephilim. There is nothing inthe Book of Enoch that says the Nephilim fell or were cast down or came downfrom heaven in any way. The most we may gather from the Book of Enoch is thatthe Nephilim are the progeny of the mating of Watchers and human women, but eventhis is complicated.An authoritative English translation of the Ethiopic text brought back by Brucewas made by the Reverend R.H. Charles and first published in 1917.73[part0123.html#chapter16-73] It contains no mention of the Nephilim anddescribes the Watcher-human offspring simply as “giants.”74[part0123.html#chapter16-74] Likewise the word Nephilim does not appear in the1979 translation of Professor Michael A. Knibb which, as well as the Ethiopictext, takes account of newly discovered Aramaic fragments from the Dead SeaScrolls.75 [part0123.html#chapter16-75] However, a more recent translation, byGeorge W. Nickelsburg and James C. VanderKam, published in 2012, draws onfurther fragments not considered by Knibb and here, in Chapter 7, Verse 2, theword Nephilim appears twice, as follows:And they [human women] conceived from them [the Watchers] and bore to them greatgiants. And the giants begot Nephilim, and to the Nephilim were born Elioud. Andthey were growing in accordance with their greatness.76[part0123.html#chapter16-76]The Nephilim do not appear again in the Nickelsburg and VanderKam translation.Nonetheless, the verse quoted above leaves no room for doubt: they are not to beconsidered as “fallen” or “cast down” or any such thing but as the progeny ofWatcher-human mating. Nor is it the first generation, the “great giants,” whoare named as Nephilim. It is the second generation, i.e. the offspring of thegiants, who are the Nephilim, and they in turn will produce offspring of theirown—the “Elioud.”If nothing else these “Elioud,” about whom very little is known outside Jewishmystical traditions, are further evidence of the close genetic relationshipbetween Watchers and humans—so close that they must really be classified as thesame species. Generally when two different species breed, even when they areclose enough to produce offspring—such as horses and donkeys for example—thoseoffspring are themselves sterile. But unlike the sterile mules that result fromhorse-donkey matings, the Nephilim are clearly not sterile, since theythemselves are able to go on to produce offspring, i.e. the Elioud.The only reasonable conclusion, as I have already indicated, is that theWatchers must have been human beings—no doubt surrounded by some aura or glamorto do with their mastery of technology and the sciences, but no more and no lesshuman than the women they mated with—and that therefore their offspring werehuman too. Quite possibly they were of large stature. Quite possibly the epithetof “giants” attached to them may also have had something to do with theirintellectual abilities, which might have been seen to be superior. But they werehuman nonetheless and I see no good reason to conclude otherwise.Meanwhile, because this is a subject around which much confusion swirls, it isnecessary to reiterate that there is no suggestion either in Genesis or inNumbers—the only places they are mentioned in the Bible—that the Nephilim had“fallen,” even in the metaphorical sense of having sinned. On the contrary, farfrom being censured, they are described as “mighty men of old,” “heroes,” “menof renown.” Genesis is unequivocal, as the reader can confirm from the passagescited earlier, that it is human wickedness, and the evil in human hearts, thatcauses God to send the Flood—a cataclysm that is survived not only by Noah’sdescendants, but by the Nephilim themselves who were still in Canaan, and stillof great stature as the Book of Numbers attests, when the Israelites came totake possession of the Promised Land.EmissariesAfter this brief excursion into the foundations of the Sitchin Nephilim cult,let us return to the Watchers, and who and what they might be.Enoch’s condemnation of them for “fornicating” with human women finds itscounterpart in Genesis where, though not named, they are clearly “the sons ofGod” who “saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wivesof all which they chose.” Thereafter the story of exactly what happened is onlypreserved in Enoch, where we’re led to understand that the Watchers:taught all unrighteousness on earth and revealed the eternal secrets which werepreserved in heaven, which men were striving to learn.77[part0123.html#chapter16-77]Turning now to another of the non-canonical scriptures, the Book of Jubilees,which purports to be a revelation given by God to Moses, we read of the Watchersagain and in a context that brings us back to the Sabians and Harran. Accordingboth to the Islamic historian Al-Masudi, and the Christian chronicler GregoryBar Hebraeus, Harran was originally founded by Cainan,78[part0123.html#chapter16-78] the great-grandson of Noah.79[part0123.html#chapter16-79] By definition, therefore, though early, Harran is apost-diluvian city. Cainan (sometimes the name is spelled Kainam) was the son ofArpachsad:And the son grew, and his father taught him writing, and he went to seek forhimself a place where he might seize for himself a city. And he found a writing,which former generations had carved on the rock, and he read what was thereon,and he transcribed it and sinned owing to it, for it contained the teaching ofthe Watchers in accordance with which they used to observe the omens of the sun,moon and stars in all the signs of heaven.80 [part0123.html#chapter16-80]Here, then, is the origin of the star worship of the Sabians traced all the wayback to the mysterious Watchers—whoever they were, whatever they were—whosettled in the Near East in antediluvian times, taught our ancestors forbiddenknowledge, broke some fundamental commandment by mating with human women and, asa result, were remembered as being responsible for the great global cataclysm ofthe Deluge.Were these Watchers the emissaries of a lost civilization of the Ice Age?Perhaps a civilization as far ahead of the Upper Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers,who made up the majority of the population of the world at that time, as our owncivilization is ahead of uncontacted tribes in the Amazon rainforest today? WhenI say “ahead” I am, of course, not speaking of moral or spiritual values butsimply of technology, skills and knowledge. Since such discrepancies still existin the twenty-first century I see no reason in principle why they should nothave existed in the remote epoch before the great cataclysms of the YoungerDryas set in between 10,800 BC and 9600 BC.To continue with this line of speculation, could it be that there was some sortof outreach before those cataclysms?A very careful, considered, structured outreach program, to observe, to study—inother words to watch—hunter-gatherer populations, but not to intermingle withthem, not to enter into the complicated entanglements of sexual and familyrelationships with them, and above all not to transfer any technology to them?One could imagine that a group of anthropologists and scientists sent off tostudy a previously uncontacted Amazon tribe today might be bound by similarstrictures. But suppose some of them disagreed? Suppose some of them “wentnative”—as used to be said of colonialists in the days of the British Empire whoallowed themselves to get too close to indigenous populations they interactedwith.Is that perhaps what happened to the troop of two hundred “Watchers” on MountHermon? Somewhere around 10,900 BC, did they break the commandments of their ownculture and “go native” among the hunter-gatherers of the Near East? And werethe first chance encounters with the fragments of a giant comet a century laterin 10,800 BC—encounters that devastated the world—somehow blamed upon theirmoral lapse?And some final thoughts. Did their civilization survive, albeit in truncated,damaged, reduced form through the rigors of the Younger Dryas, until the secondfateful encounter with the comet’s debris stream in 9600 BC that ended the “longfatal winter,” but also led to the final sinking and destruction of “theHomeland of the Primeval Ones?”That “island” realm, far-off in the ocean, that bears such striking resemblancesto Plato’s description of Atlantis.Was it then that the last survivors of the once advanced and prosperouscivilization set out to wander the world in ships to initiate their great designintended ultimately, perhaps after thousands of years, to bring about theresurrection of the former world of the gods?And were Egypt, Baalbek, and Göbekli Tepe among the places these “Magicians ofthe Gods” chose to settle in order to set their plan in motion—perhaps preciselybecause there had been outreach in these areas before the cataclysms andtherefore their potential and the character of their inhabitants were known?Was Harran part of the second stage of this plan, when the work of the lastinitiates at Göbekli Tepe was done and the time-capsule they had created therewas buried to be rediscovered in a future age?Buried in the bowels of the earth like that “white porphyry stone” spoken of inthe Masonic tradition cited earlier?Or like the “writing carved on rock” containing the teachings of the Watcherswhich Cainan found and transcribed at the time he established Harran, bringinginto his city knowledge of the omens of the sun, moon and stars and “all thesigns in heaven?”Knowledge of exactly the type that would be central to the mysterious starreligion of the Sabians in the millennia to come …Astronomy and earth measuringArchaeoastronomer James Q. Jacobs has noticed something rather odd about Harran.The city’s latitude, 36.87 degrees north of the equator, appears to benon-random, since the figure is the same as that for the acute angle of a 3:4:5right triangle81 [part0123.html#chapter16-81]—i.e. a triangle which contains one90 degree right angle and whose side lengths are in the ratio 3:4:5. In all suchtriangles—which form the basis for trigonometry and are thus fundamental toastronomy and geodesy—the other two angles are, with rounding, 53.13 degrees and36.87 degrees.Is it a coincidence that a 3:4:5 right triangle with the same internal anglesexists inside the King’s Chamber of the Great Pyramid of Egypt? The floor ofthis austere and uninscribed red granite room, in which no pharaoh was everfound entombed, forms a 2:1 rectangle, exactly 20 Egyptian royal cubits inlength and 10 royal cubits in width (10.46 x 5.23 meters). The right triangle isformed with its shortest dimension (15 cubits) represented by the diagonalacross the west wall from the lower southwest corner to the upper northwestcorner; its median dimension (20 cubits) is drawn along the entire length of thefloor on the south side of the chamber; its long dimension (25 cubits) is drawnfrom the upper northwest corner of the chamber to the lower southeast corner.82[part0123.html#chapter16-82]These side lengths of 15 cubits, 20 cubits and 25 cubits can be expressed as theratio 3:4:5 because if we allocate the value “3” to the length of 15 cubits then20 cubits must naturally have a value of “4” and 25 cubits must have a value of“5.” All right-angled triangles with side lengths in this special 3:4:5 ratioare called “Pythagorean”—after Pythagoras, the Greek philosopher andmathematician of the sixth century BC, who was supposedly the first to discoverthat they share a unique characteristic. This is that the square of the shortside (3 units x 3 units = 9 units), added to the square of the median side (4units x 4 units = 16 units), together result in a figure equal to the square ofthe long side (5 units x 5 units = 25 units, i.e. the sum of 9 plus 16).83[part0123.html#chapter16-83] The real “secret magic” of the triangle, however,as the Icelandic mathematician Einar Palsson has pointed out, is only revealedwhen the numbers are cubed.84 [part0123.html#chapter16-84] Then we get:image [../images/00061.jpeg]Figure 58: The 3:4:5 right triangle hidden within the King’s Chamber of theGreat Pyramid.3 x 3 x 3 = 274 x 4 x 4 = 645 x 5 x 5 = 125The total of 27 plus 64 plus 125 is 216, and as the reader will recall fromearlier chapters, 216 is one of the sequence of numbers identified by historiansof science Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend as being derived fromprecise observations of the precession of the equinoxes, those long-term changesin the sky that unfold at the rate of one degree every 72 years. Numbers derivedfrom this precessional sequence turn out to be encoded in ancient myths andmonuments all around the world, tracing their origins back to what Santillanaand von Dechend can only conclude was some “almost unbelievable” ancestorcivilization of prehistoric antiquity that “first dared to understand the worldas created according to number, measure and weight.”85[part0123.html#chapter16-85]The heartbeat of the cycle, as we’ve seen, is 72—the number of years requiredfor the unfolding of one degree of precessional change. In observational terms aone degree shift over 72 years—effectively an entire human lifetime—is barelyperceptible, being roughly equivalent to the width of a forefinger held uptoward the horizon. A 30 degree shift—through one entire zodiacal constellation,requiring 30 x 72 = 2,160 years to complete—is impossible to miss, but itsprogression could only be precisely recorded and noted by many generations ofconscientious and accurate observers. A 60 degree shift, i.e. through twozodiacal constellations, takes 4,320 years (2,160 x 2 = 4,320), which is why a360 degree shift (all 12 zodiacal constellations—“the Great Year”) requires agrand total of 25,920 years.Within the “precessional code” as Santillana and von Dechend showedconclusively, it is permissible to divide and multiply the “heartbeat number” of72 (the number of years required for one degree of precessional change). This isdone in myths and monuments all around the world (for example at Angkor, inCambodia, as we saw in Chapter Twelve, and at Borobudur, in Indonesia, as wewill see in Chapter Eighteen). Thus 216 is 3 x 72 (or 2,160 divided by 10). Itsderivation from the 3:4:5 triangle inside the King’s Chamber of the GreatPyramid is therefore most unlikely to be an accident and the relationship of allthis to astronomy and geodesy—earth-measuring—is clear. This is furtherconfirmed by the external dimensions of the Great Pyramid which, as I showed inFingerprints of the Gods, encode the dimensions of our planet on theprecessional scale of 1:43,200.86 [part0123.html#chapter16-86]Essentially, if you measure the height of the Great Pyramid and multiply it by43,200 you get the polar radius of the earth and if you measure the baseperimeter of the Great Pyramid and multiply by 43,200 you get the equatorialcircumference of the earth. The fact that 43,200 is one of the sequence ofprecessional numbers identified by Santillana and von Dechend further reducesthe likelihood of coincidence, and requires us to take seriously the propositionthat we are indeed looking at part of the intellectual legacy of some “almostunbelievable” ancestor civilization that had measured the earth and observed thechanges in the stars with scientific accuracy, long before what we understand as“history” began.image [../images/00062.jpeg]Figure 59: The Great Pyramid encodes the dimensions of our planet on theprecessional scale of 1:43,200. The height of Great Pyramid multiplied by 43,200gives us the polar radius of the earth and the base perimeter of the GreatPyramid multiplied by 43,200 give us the equatorial circumference of the earthwith only minor errors in both cases.So, to return to Harran, James Q. Jacobs’ discovery certainly suggests that thefounders of this city made a deliberate geodetic choice when they set it atlatitude 36.87 degrees north. What adds to this impression is that Jacobs hasalso found a geodetic relationship between Harran and the fabled Mesopotamiancity of Ur with which it was known to have enjoyed a close relationship inantiquity:87 [part0123.html#chapter16-87]The history/myth of Mesopotamia holds that Ur and Harran are two important,related Sumerian centers, both associated with the moon. I checked the [latitudeof] the Ur ziggurat, at 30.963 degrees. At first I did not notice colatitudeequals 5/3 arctangent (atan). Colatitude is the distance to the nearest pole, ageodetic reference point. Latitude references the equator, the mid-poles planeperpendicular to the rotation axis. The local level plane at Harran intersectsthe rotation axis at a 4/3 atan angle, forming a 3:4:5 right triangle, as doeslatitude in relation to the equator and geodetic center. Summarizing, colatitudeat Harran equals 4/3 atan and at Ur 5/3 atan. Thus latitude at Harran equals 3/4atan and at Ur 3/5 atan. Perhaps these “idolators” were doing astronomy?88[part0123.html#chapter16-88]I would go further and say undoubtedly the Sabian “star-worshippers” of Harranwere doing astronomy. And given the evidence we’ve reviewed in Chapters Fourteenand Fifteen for precise calculations of precession by the makers of GöbekliTepe—so precise that they were able to create a symbolic picture of the wintersolstice sky in our own epoch, 11,600 years in their future—I am not surprisedby further evidence in this region of extremely ancient and extremely precisescientific astronomy and geodesy. This evidence goes far beyond the capabilitiesnormally attributed to the historical civilization of Mesopotamia and because itdraws back the veil, requiring us to look very deeply into prehistory, it againraises the specter of a lost civilization.Jacobs has noticed this and admits to being puzzled by it. His final discoveryof relevance here concerns the geodetic relationship between Göbekli Tepe andHarran:The sites are apparently intervisible, just over 40 km apart. The difference inlatitude from Harran to Göbekli Tepe equals precisely 1/1,000 of earth’scircumference. This is where we enter a twilight zone in ancient astronomy. Ofcourse the opposite metaphor—“the dawn” of ancient astronomy—is the proper oneregarding the implication. Göbekli Tepe features the oldest known room alignednorth-south, evidence of astronomy in practice.Even non-archaeos understand stratification and deposition basics—deeper isolder. Göbekli Tepe is 12,000 years old. Harran is equated … with Ur of Sumeria,the “Civilized Land” and a “cradle of civilization.” That cradle and astronomyis presumed to be 4,000 to 5,000 years old, not 12,000. Harran is located at 3/4atan latitude, a fixed parameter, and Göbekli Tepe is at a specific latitudedifference north. Because the fixed parameter must come first, the conundrum, ofcourse, is that this precise 1/1,000 of circumference latitude difference iseither a coincidence, or ancient astronomy just took a leap back to 12,000 yearsago.89 [part0123.html#chapter16-89]My understanding is that Jacobs is no fan of alternative history and he hascommented forthrightly on the amount of “utterly unbelievable pseudo-science”that is presently in circulation on the internet and in the media concerningGöbekli Tepe.90 [part0123.html#chapter16-90] Kudos to him, therefore, for goingwhere the genuine science takes him and keeping an open mind to the possibilitythat ancient astronomy and precise earth-measuring may indeed go back muchfurther into the “twilight zone” than mainstream archaeology has hithertosupposed.The Magi of HarranAs Harran was in its beginning—a center of the “exact sciences” as Jacobsproposes91 [part0123.html#chapter16-91]—so it continued to be throughout themillennia when the Sabians practiced their “star worship” here. As late as theninth century AD, al-Battani, better known in the west as Albategnius, arguablythe most distinguished astronomer and mathematician of the Middle Ages, was bornin Harran and went on during a long and distinguished life92[part0123.html#chapter16-92] to record many remarkable scientific achievements.Of particular note, combining both exact astronomy and exact geodesy, was hiscalculation of the greatest distance of the moon from the earth (since themoon’s orbit is elliptical it has both a perigee, the point at which it isclosest to the earth and an apogee, the point at which it is furthest away).Al-Battani’s estimate of the moon’s distance at apogee was within 0.6 percent ofthe modern value.93 [part0123.html#chapter16-93] He is also noted for hiscalculation of the length of the solar year at 365 days, 5 hours, 46 minutes and24 seconds94 [part0123.html#chapter16-94]—an error of only 2 minutes 22 secondswhen compared with the figure produced by modern astronomers with the benefit ofadvanced technology.95 [part0123.html#chapter16-95] Al-Battani catalogued 489stars,96 [part0123.html#chapter16-96] produced more accurate measurements of thesun’s path than Copernicus would achieve 600 years later,97[part0123.html#chapter16-97] and gave important trigonometric formulae for righttriangles,98 [part0123.html#chapter16-98] a fact of the history of science thatis perhaps noteworthy in view of the relationship of Harran’s latitude to right3:4:5 triangles discussed above.Al-Battani’s full name, which includes a number of revealing epithets, was AbuAbdallah al-Battani Ibn Jabir Ibn Sinan al-Raqqi al-Harrani al-Sabi. The originof the epithet “al-Battani” itself is unknown, but is conjectured to refer to astreet or district of Harran, his birth city—from whence “al-Harrani” is ofcourse also derived. “Al-Raqqi” refers to the city of al-Raqqa, on the Euphratesriver in Syria, where al-Battani spent much of his working life. Mostinteresting, however, is the epithet “al-Sabi” which, according to theauthoritative Dictionary of Scientific Biography, indicates that al-Battani’sancestors, if not he himself:had professed the religion of the Harranian Sabians in which a considerableamount of the ancient Mesopotamian astral theology and star lore appears to havebeen preserved and which, tolerated by the Muslim rulers, survived until themiddle of the eleventh century. The fact that al-Battani’s elder contemporary,the great mathematician and astronomer Thabit ibn Qurra, hailed from the sameregion and still adhered to the Sabian religion, seems indicative of the keeninterest in astronomy that characterized even this last phase of Mesopotamianstar idolatry.99 [part0123.html#chapter16-99]Thabit ibn Qurra (AD 836–901, and also born in Harran), would have had littlepatience with loaded terms like “star idolatry” which seek to place the“paganism” of the Sabians on a lower level than the deadly, and often bigoted,narrow-minded and unscientific clerical monotheism of religions likeChristianity, Judaism and Islam. Thabit was well aware that, underlying theancient Sabian practices misunderstood by these young religions as “staridolatry,” were indeed exact sciences of great benefit to mankind, and thus hewrote:Who else have civilized the world, and built the cities, if not the nobles andkings of Paganism? Who else have set in order the harbors and rivers? And whoelse have taught the hidden wisdom? To whom else has the Deity revealed itself,given oracles, and told about the future, if not the famous men among thePagans? The Pagans have made known all this. They have discovered the art ofhealing the soul; they have also made known the art of healing the body. Theyhave filled the earth with settled forms of government, and with wisdom, whichis the highest good. Without Paganism the world would be empty and miserable.100[part0123.html#chapter16-100]To the above should be added that even this translation fails to do justice towhat Thabit was attempting to convey here. The Syriac word hanputho that he usedin his original text, and that is translated above as “paganism” in fact means“the pure religion.”101 [part0123.html#chapter16-101] Its cognate in Arabic isthe word hanif, which appears in the Koran referencing ancient pre-Islamicfaiths that were regarded as pure and thus not to be persecuted.102[part0123.html#chapter16-102] Indeed the Sabians were accorded recognition bymany leading thinkers in the early centuries of Islam as the archetypalhanifs103 [part0123.html#chapter16-103] and this, together with their famousclaim to be a “people of the book,” was among the reasons why they were leftfree for so long to practice the old ways.We’ve already seen how the Sabians were allowed to build a new Temple of theMoon God, and to continue their religious rites, after the Arab General IbnGhanam conquered Harran in the seventh century AD. This in itself is a sign ofmost unusual favor, since Islamic armies normally offered “pagans” the choice ofeither conversion or death. Even more interesting, however, is the Sabians’encounter with the Abbasid Caliph Abu Jafar Abdullah al-Ma’mun, who passedthrough their city in AD 830 and reportedly quizzed them intensively on theirreligion.104 [part0123.html#chapter16-104]Remembering the Sabian pilgrimages to Giza, it is reasonable to wonder whetherthere is any connection with the fact that in AD 820, a decade before he visitedHarran, it was Ma’mun who tunnelled into the Great Pyramid and opened itspreviously hidden passageways and chambers. Indeed, it is through “Ma’mun’sHole” that visitors still enter the monument today.105[part0123.html#chapter16-105] Described by Gibbon as “a prince of rarelearning,”106 [part0123.html#chapter16-106] it seems Ma’mun’s investigation wasprompted by information he’d received about the Great Pyramid, specifically thatit contained:a secret chamber with maps and tables of the celestial and terrestrial spheres.Although they were said to have been made in the remote past, they were supposedto be of great accuracy.107 [part0123.html#chapter16-107]Like his father Harun al-Rashid of Arabian nights fame, Ma’mun belonged to aline of learned and open-minded Caliphs. By the eleventh century, however, whenthe last Temple of the Moon God in Harran was finally destroyed, a new, morefundamentalist and far less tolerant faction had seized the reins of Islam andthe suppression of “the pure religion” of the Sabians began in earnest. We knowthey continued to make their pilgrimages to Giza until the thirteenth century,but after that they disappear from history and, while some scholars feel thatelements of their faith survive among such sects as the Mandeans and the Yazidisof Iraq108 [part0123.html#chapter16-108] (who themselves have been subjected tointense Islamic persecution in modern times), there seems to be no trace left ofthe Sabians today.Except for one tantalizing and intriguing thought.The sacred Book of the Sabians was the compilation of texts now known as theHermetica,109 [part0123.html#chapter16-109] a copy of which most mysteriouslyfound its way into the hands of Leonardo de Pistoia, an agent of Cosimo deMedici, founder of the Medici political dynasty of Florence. It was 1460 andPistoia was traveling in Macedonia at the time, but immediately returned toFlorence with the treasure of ancient wisdom that he had acquired. With equalspeed, Cosimo ordered his adopted son Marsilio Ficino to delay translation ofthe complete works of Plato, on which he had just begun, and to translate theHermetica instead.110 [part0123.html#chapter16-110] It was, as the late DameFrances Yates, one of the world’s leading experts on the Renaissance, hasobserved, “an extraordinary situation.”111 [part0123.html#chapter16-111]Indeed so, particularly since there is much to suggest that it was thisintroduction of Hermetic ideas into fifteenth century Europe that kicked theRenaissance into high gear and gave birth to the modern world.112[part0123.html#chapter16-112]Or was it, perhaps, not so much the birth of a new world as it was therebirth—the “resurrection” in the language of the Edfu texts—of the former worldof the gods?Signs of the handsAs we have seen, the Edfu texts speak of the Seven Sages, bringers of wisdom tomankind, teachers of science and magic. The Mesopotamian texts also speak ofSeven Sages—the Apkallus—whose functions are identical to those of theirEgyptian counterparts. We have explored all this in earlier chapters and neednot repeat ourselves here. What I was unaware of, however, until I began toinvestigate the traditions of the Watchers in the Book of Enoch, the Book ofJubilees and elsewhere, is that scholars have discovered close links between theWatchers and the Apkallus.For example, “figurines of Apkallus were buried in boxes in the foundationdeposits in Mesopotamian buildings in order to avert evil … The term massare,Watchers, is used of these sets.”113 [part0123.html#chapter16-113] Likewise theApkallus were said to have taught antediluvian sciences to humanity and so, too,were the Watchers.114 [part0123.html#chapter16-114] As one scholar concludes,however: “The Jewish authors often inverted the Mesopotamian intellectualtraditions with the intention of showing the superiority of their own culturalfoundations. [Thus] … the antediluvian sages, the Mesopotamian Apkallus, weredemonised as the ‘sons of God’ and … appear as the Watchers … illegitimateteachers of humankind before the flood.”115 [part0123.html#chapter16-115]All in all, what this body of research reveals is a series of links between theWatchers and the Apkallus so close that they might reasonably be supposed to betwo different names, or titles, for the same beings.116[part0123.html#chapter16-116] There is neither space nor need here to explorethis material with all its multiple interconnections in any further detail, butI find it tempting to imagine that it might be these very beings—these Watchers,these Sages—who are depicted on the tall megalithic pillars at Göbekli Tepe.Notwithstanding their resemblance to the symbols of Mesopotamian deities (seeChapter Fifteen), the presence of the bag-like objects on the upper register ofPillar 43 in Enclosure D that I first drew attention to in Chapter One continuesto intrigue me, since these objects are also so similar to the bags held in thehands of the Apkallu figures in many ancient depictions. And that similarity, asthe reader will recall, is not confined to the Near East. In a sculpture fromthe Olmec site of La Venta, overlooking the Gulf of Mexico, a relief ofQuetzalcoatl, the Feathered Serpent, the legendary bringer of civilization tothe peoples of Central America, carries an identical bag.Before leaving Turkey in July 2014 we make one more trip back to Göbekli Tepe. Ican hardly bear to see it under its horrible, heavy wooden roof, which plungesall four of the main enclosures into a looming sepulchral gloom. But there’s aparticular reason why I want to take a final look at Enclosure D, not this timeat Pillar 43, but at the two central pillars with their crooked arms and theirhands with long fingers that almost meet over their stone bellies.When I’m satisfied I’ve seen enough we have our driver take us back in toŞanlIurfa, to the main museum, where numerous artifacts from Göbekli Tepe,thought too precious to leave at the site, are on display. I’ve been herebefore, too, but there are a number of details I want to remind myself of.I spend a long time in front of a mesmerizing sculpture of a human figure. Itwasn’t found at Göbekli Tepe, but was an accidental discovery made in the 1980sin ŞanlIurfa itself, in the heart of the old town where deep foundations werebeing dug for a car park. It has been dated to the Göbekli Tepe period—i.e. toaround 9000 BC—and is “on its way,” Klaus Schmidt has written, “to become worldfamous as the oldest completely preserved life-sized statue of mankind.”117[part0123.html#chapter16-117]Unlike the megalithic pillars at Göbekli Tepe where the “heads” arestylized—resembling the upper crossbar of the letter “T”—this figure has a fullyformed human head and face with glittering black obsidian eyes, a pronouncedchin that gives every impression of being bearded, a pectoral in the form of alarge double “V” carved in high relief across its chest, and its arms crooked inthe manner of the Göbekli Tepe figures with the fingers almost meeting acrossthe front of the belly.I move on to the second piece I want to examine, the so-called “Totem Pole.”It’s even eerier than the first. Again it’s about normal human height but it isby no means entirely human. Instead it’s a complex hybrid with multipledifferent characteristics. The head is badly damaged, but the ears and eyes havebeen preserved and suggest a predator of some kind, perhaps a bear, or perhaps alion or leopard. So it’s a therianthrope. Then large serpents wind up along theoutside of its legs. They have oversized heads which project forward at aboutthe level of the figure’s groin.There are two sets of arms and hands that seem to belong to the figure itself.In the case of the upper pair, the arms are crooked in the usual Göbekli Tepemanner and the hands are brought together, with the fingers almost touchingacross the chest. Then there’s a second pair of what seem to be forearms andhands only, with the fingers again coming together and almost touching acrossthe belly roughly at the level of the navel.Moving down, at about the level of the genitals, a small head and two furtherarms protrude outward from the midline of the figure. Again there are thoselong-fingered hands almost meeting, but this time they appear to be playing adrum. Beside them, but just below them, there is the hint, much damaged, of afurther pair of arms and hands.Much about all this is familiar to me.Very familiar.Not from Göbekli Tepe, though, as we’ll see in the next chapter, but from thefar side of the world."},{"pageContent":" Part VII [part0131.html#c_part7]Distance [part0131.html#c_part7]"},{"pageContent":" Chapter 17 [part0131.html#c_ch17]Mountain [part0131.html#c_ch17]It’s October 2013 and I’m on the slopes above the city of Cuzco, in the highAndes of Peru exploring the incredible megalithic site of Sacsayhuaman withJesus Gamarra, a descendant of the Incas. Gamarra is in his mid-seventies, morethan ten years older than me, but you’d never guess it from looking at him. He’sas nimble as a mountain goat, fully acclimatized to the altitude of 3,701 meters(12,142 feet), and fit as an Olympic athlete after years of clambering aroundthe passes and trails of his homeland during a lifetime of research into theorigins of Inca culture.image [../images/00063.jpeg]Figure 60My first visit to Sacsayhuaman was in 1992, and I’ve been back many times since,always learning something new. In Fingerprints of the Gods, published in 1995, Iexpressed my skepticism of the orthodox theory that practically all of the greatmonuments of the Andes are the work of the Incas—whose empire was not much morethan a century old at the start of the Spanish conquest of Peru in 1531. “Sinceit was known that the Incas made extensive use of Sacsayhuaman,” I wrote inFingerprints, “I could easily understand why it had been assumed that they hadbuilt it. But there was no obvious or necessary connection between these twopropositions. The Incas could just as well have found the structures already inplace and moved into them.”1 [part0124.html#chapter17-1] In Heaven’s Mirror(1998) I further developed the argument that the gigantic megalithic androck-hewn constructions of the Andes, which are by no means confined toSacsayhuaman but are found all over the region, were not the work of the Incasbut of a much earlier, predecessor civilization long lost to history:In such an event it is not necessary to imagine a complete break in continuitybetween the hypothesized “elder culture” and the Incas; on the contrary, thelatter could have inherited some of the traditions and knowledge of the formerand attempted, on a smaller scale, to mimic their cyclopean world.2[part0124.html#chapter17-2]I didn’t know Gamarra or his work when I wrote the passages quoted above. Now,as he shows me around Sacsayhuaman, carefully and painstakingly explainingeverything he wants me to see, taking me to hidden nooks and corners of the sitethat I was completely unaware of before, he opens my eyes to all sorts ofdetails that support and reinforce my earlier intuitions. More than that, hepresents a solid archaeological case, originally worked out by his father,Alfredo Gamarra, and greatly refined and extended by himself, that would, Ifeel, be worthy of serious consideration by mainstream scholars—if, that is, themainstream were not so locked in to the rigid preconception that all thesemonuments are just a few hundred years old and entirely the work of the Incas.3[part0124.html#chapter17-3]It is notoriously difficult to know, with any useful level of certainty, the ageof anonymous, uninscribed stone monuments. Carbon dating of associated organicmaterials is only useful when we can be absolutely certain that the materialsbeing dated were deposited at the same time as the cutting and placing of thestone we are interested in. In the case of many megalithic structures this isimpossible. Surface luminescence dating, which we saw in Chapter Ten has alreadyproduced some anomalous results at the Pyramid of Menkaure and at the Sphinx andValley Temples of Giza, has not yet been widely taken up by the archaeologicalestablishment and has never been applied to the monuments of the Andes. In theabsence of useful objective tests, therefore, the next routine strategy is tolook at architectural style and methods. Just as different styles of pottery canoften provide reliable indications as to what culture in what period made aparticular piece, so too with architecture. The rule of thumb is that verydifferent styles and approaches to the construction or creation of stonemonuments, even if they stand side by side, are indicative of the involvement ofdifferent cultures working at different periods in the past.Unfortunately this logical and reasonable technique of stylistic dating is notpopular with archaeologists studying the monuments of the Andes—perhaps because,if they were to deploy it here, as they do elsewhere, they would be forced toquestion the established theory that the Incas made everything. Archaeology is adeeply conservative discipline and I have found that archaeologists, no matterwhere they are working, have a horror of questioning anything their predecessorsand peers have already announced to be true. They run a very real risk ofjeopardizing their careers if they do. In consequence they focus—perhaps to alarge extent subconsciously—on evidence and arguments that don’t upset theapplecart. There might be room for some tinkering around the edges, somerefinement of orthodox ideas, but God forbid that anything should be discoveredthat might seriously undermine the established paradigm.What Gamarra is showing me as we walk around Sacsayhuaman is that there arethree distinctly different styles of architecture here—so different, indeed,that it is extremely difficult to understand why archaeologists insist they areall the work of the same Inca culture, and were all made during the century orso prior to the arrival of the Spanish. It is unnecessary to repeat the detaileddescriptions of this site that I have given in my earlier books. In brief,however, Sacsayhuaman stands on a hillside above and overlooking the city ofCuzco and consists of a series of three parallel rows of walls, all about 6meters (20 feet) high, constructed entirely of gigantic megaliths, some weighingin excess of 360 tons,4 [part0124.html#chapter17-4] each wall offering a jagged,almost zig-zag profile, built into the side of a slope and arranged in stepfashion one above the other. Past the uppermost wall the slope continues to risetoward the south and is littered with the ruins of a number of much smallerbuildings; one of these, right at the top, consisting of three concentriccircles of nicely-cut blocks, preserved at foundation level only, must have beenimpressive when it was intact. Beyond it, a valley overgrown with trees anddense bushes slopes steeply down to the south with Cuzco nestling in its floor.Turning northward, a grassy plateau perhaps 100 meters wide extends from thebase of the lowest of the three megalithic walls along its full length of some400 meters. On the north side of the plateau, a natural rocky knoll of volcanicdiorite rises, but it has been cut and shaped into intricate terrace and stepformations. This is where Gamarra and I are now standing and he launches into anexplanation.image [../images/00064.jpeg]Figure 61: Plan of Sacsayhuaman, zig-zag megalithic walls to the south, shapedrocky knoll to the north.“This is ‘Hanan Pacha’ work,” he says, indicating the beautifully cut dioriteterraces at our feet. “The first world. It was made thousands of years beforethe time of the Incas. They knew how to shape stone then.” A mischievous grin.“They could do anything they wanted with it. Maybe it was easy for them.” Hestoops, beckons for me to look closely at the surface of the rock. “You see?”I shrug. I’m puzzled. I’m not sure what he wants me to see.“No tool marks,” he says. He gestures proudly at the whole carved, sculptedartifact, the whole gigantic work of art that the knoll has been transformedinto. “No tool marks anywhere.”“So what did they do? Buff the tool marks off after they’d cut the stone?”“No,” says Gamarra. “They didn’t need tools. They had another way. It was thesame in the second world, too, which I call ‘Uran Pacha.’” He points to thelooming megalithic walls opposite. There is some disagreement among the expertsabout exactly what kind of stone they are made from and where it was quarried.The consensus, although some green diorite porphyry and some andesite are alsopresent, is that a very hard and dense form of local limestone was used for themegaliths themselves. Quarries at 15 kilometers distance and at 3 kilometersdistance have been identified as sources for the limestone.5[part0124.html#chapter17-5]We scramble down the side of the knoll and across the grassy plaza until westand beneath the courses of hulking megaliths that have become the definitiveimage that Sacsayhuaman now projects to the world. As always when I’m here, myfirst sensation is of wonder. I feel small, diminished, pint-sized. It’s notjust that the walls, and the blocks they’re built of, are big. They seem tohave—dare I say it?—a personality of their own, and it is the personality of aslumbering giant.What’s spectacular about these walls, quite apart from their size, quite apartfrom the fact that there are at least a thousand individual blocks, is thebreathtaking virtuoso feat that has been performed in joining them together. Imean, let’s be serious here. When you are building a wall in which the smallestblock you plan to use weighs a ton, while the majority weigh over 20 tons, wheremany weigh 100 tons, some weigh 200 tons and a few weigh more than 300 tons, youhave already set yourself a formidable logistical challenge.But then suppose, just for the hell of it, you decide to up the ante a littlemore and insist that these walls must be constructed in the form of hugethree-dimensional jigsaw puzzles. Every block has to be a polygon with anywherebetween six and a dozen sides, every polygon has to be different—no twoalike—and they must all fit together with one another so tightly that you won’tbe able to get a razor blade between the joints.I can’t speak for the back of the blocks where they lock into other blocksbehind them—again, presumably, multi-dimensionally—but the patterns made alongtheir weird cyclopean façades are already complicated enough without consideringwhat’s going on out of sight. It’s obvious, gazing up in stupefied awe at thescale and complexity of the project, that this must have been an incrediblydifficult thing to do! Whoever was responsible for Sacsayhuaman’s megalithicphase can only have been top-class professionals with years of experience behindthem and a very long tradition of distilled knowledge to draw upon. You can’tconceive, and plan, and build something like this with only a century or two oftrial and error behind you—as is supposed to be the case with the Incas. Thesemegaliths of Sacsayhuaman are the mature work of grandmasters of stone.Moreover, throughout the Andes, there is no evidence of apprentices learning howto do this, no early prototypes that are good but don’t quite succeed. Otherstructures might not be on the scale of Sacsayhuaman (though many come close)but all of them, whether at Pisac, or Ollantaytambo or Machu Picchu, or at ascore of other sites, share the same level of complexity while embracingdifferent challenges—such as extremely difficult locations very far from thequarries—that Sacsayhuaman does not have to overcome. All of them aremasterworks from the beginning. All of them are perfect. It’s almost as if, asGamarra says, “it was easy for them.”I know he has a theory to explain this. The theory is that gravity was lowerduring his first two “worlds”—the Hanan Pacha stage and the Uran Pacha stage—andthat this made stone lighter and easier to manipulate. The lowered gravity islinked in his mind with the notion that the earth once made much closer orbitsaround the sun—an orbit of 225 days and an orbit of 260 days—before settling into its present 365 day path.6 [part0124.html#chapter17-6] He could be right; newscience suggests that the orbits of the planets are not fixed and stable but canbe subject to radical changes that, among other things, are capable ofincreasing the flux of comets into the inner solar system.7[part0124.html#chapter17-7]However, this isn’t the part of his theory I’m interested in. Where I feel he issolidly persuasive is in his observations of the anomalous character of themonuments of the Andes—observations that are based on fifty years of his ownfieldwork and sixty years of fieldwork by his father. The Gamarras have walkedthe walk and earned the right to speak out on this matter, and when they speak,though they themselves are of Inca descent, their message is absolutelyclear—many of the great architectural works that are attributed to the Incaswere not made by the Incas. There are traces of a lost civilization here. Indeednot just one lost civilization, but—if Gamarra’s time-frame is correct—two.“All the big blocks of Sacsayhuaman are from the Uran Pacha period,” he says.We’re standing in a corner at a junction of a dozen or so of these incredibleblocks. Gamarra highlights again the precision of their joints that look asthough some modern machine tool has been at work, and the daunting complexity ofthe patterns they form. Then he draws my attention to something else. Several ofthe blocks have weird circular hollows and shallow tracks with raised edgesscalloped into their faces along with other peculiar, seemingly random,patterns. “No tool marks,” he reiterates. “No chisels. No hammers.”“So how did they do it?”“Doesn’t it look,” Gamarra asks, “like they worked with the stone when it wassoft?” He runs his hand along the curves and angles of a polygonal joint. “Likebutter? So they could mold everything together?”Suddenly all becomes clear. The strange shapes I’m seeing in the rock would beeasy, indeed effortless, to create if these blocks were made of something of theconsistency of room-temperature butter instead of cold, hard limestone. Then aswell as molding them together to create this massive jigsaw puzzle effect, thetip of a table-knife could be used to gouge out the shallow scallops and theback of a spoon would serve to make the hollows.It’s an attractive idea and I don’t have to buy into Gamarra’s theories aboutorbits and gravity in order to explore it further. There are other ways ofexplaining the patterns. For example, the technology of a lost civilizationmight have been up to the challenge of softening rock so that it could be workedlike butter. Perhaps heat was involved? An intriguing study by the Institute ofTectonics and Geophysics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, working incooperation with Peru’s Ministry of Culture, produced evidence that thelimestone of the Sacsayhuaman megaliths was at some point subjected totemperatures in excess of 900 degrees centigrade and possibly as high as 1100degrees centigrade.When the Russian researchers went to the quarries where the blocks are believedto have been cut, they found the natural limestone filled with tiny organicfossils. This is what you would expect, since limestone is a sedimentary rockthat forms under ancient seas and consists largely of the remains of tiny shellsand the micro-skeletons of other marine organisms. Strangely, when samples fromthe Sacsayhuaman megaliths were assayed by the researchers they confirmed thatthe rock was indeed limestone of “high density.”8 [part0124.html#chapter17-8]However there were:no obvious fossils and organic remains in it, but only clearly visiblefine-grained structure.9 [part0124.html#chapter17-9]Their conclusion was that the blocks had been subjected to intense heat betweenthe time when they were quarried and the time when they were placed into thewall and that this heat was sufficient to reduce the fossils to indeterminatefine-grained structure:Of course we need more detailed researches and analysis in order to estimate thereal reason for the thermal effects on the studied limestone … But the factremains the fact—recrystallization of biogenic siliceous limestone intomicrocrystalline siliceous limestone. The result of this process we can see inthe material forming the wall polygonal blocks of Sacsayhuaman. In normal natureconditions this process is absolutely impossible.10 [part0124.html#chapter17-10]“Some magic presided over its construction…”Jesus Gamarra and I continue our exploration by climbing the stairways throughthe lines of the megalithic walls until we reach the slope above and canapproach the dilapidated ruins littering the hilltop. “These,” says Gamarra,indicating the ruins, “are examples of what was done in the Ukun Pachaperiod—the work of the Incas.” Some of it, he makes clear, for example thestructure of three concentric circles of walls, was very nicely done. The Incascalled it Muyuc Marca, he tells me. It was a tower that once rose to over 30meters in height and was built as an imperial residence for the Emperor—whosetitle was “the Inca.” Only later, and by extension, did the entire nation become“the Incas.”Gamarra’s argument is that in buildings like Muyuc Marca we are looking at thefinest results the Incas were capable of. Yet these results are so patentlyinferior to the megaliths—and so different—that they must obviously be acceptedas the work of another culture.Curiously, although such ideas are regarded as heresy by archaeologists today,this was not the case when the Andes first came under serious scientificscrutiny in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. For example, thegreat geographer Sir Clements Markham, who traveled extensively in Peru andwrote the classic study The Incas of Peru, states that “the Incas knew nothing”of the origins of Sacsayhuaman:Garcilaso refers to towers, walls, and gates built by the Incas, and even givesthe names of the architects; but these were later defenses built within thegreat cyclopean fortress. The outer lines must be attributed to the megalithicage. There is nothing of the kind which can be compared to them in any otherpart of the world.11 [part0124.html#chapter17-11]The “Garcilaso” mentioned by Markham is the chronicler Garcilaso Inca de laVega, the son of a Spanish conquistador and an Inca princess, a heritage thatgave him unique access to genuine Inca traditions, particularly since he wasborn and brought up in Cuzco and spoke Quechua, the language of the Incas, ashis mother tongue. Had the megalithic elements of Sacsayhuaman been recent work,done in the century before Garcilaso’s birth, there should have been fresh andclear memories, even eye-witness accounts, of so magnificent an achievement. ButGarcilaso reports nothing of the sort and instead can only offer magic as anexplanation for what he describes as “an even greater enigma than the sevenwonders of the world.” Here is what he wrote about Sacsayhuaman in his RoyalCommentaries:Its proportions are inconceivable when one has not actually seen it; and whenone has looked at it closely and examined it attentively, they appear to be soextraordinary that it seems as though some magic had presided over itsconstruction; that it must be the work of demons, instead of human beings … Ifwe think, too, that this incredible work was accomplished without the help of asingle machine, is it too much to say that it represents an even greater enigmathan the seven wonders of the world? How can we explain the fact that thesePeruvian Indians were able to split, carve, lift, carry, hoist and lower suchenormous blocks of stone, which are more like pieces of a mountain than buildingstones, and that they accomplished this, as I said before, without the help of asingle machine or instrument? An enigma such as this one cannot be easily solvedwithout the help of magic.12 [part0124.html#chapter17-12]Are we looking, yet again, at the handiwork of the Magicians of the Gods?Remembering that the great temple of Edfu in Upper Egypt was dedicated to thegod Horus, who was sometimes depicted as a falcon and sometimes as a lion, it isintriguing to discover that the very name “Sacsayhuaman” means Falcon(specifically “Satisfied Falcon”). Furthermore, it has long been recognized thatSacsayhuaman forms part of a large geoglyph, once visible from surroundingmountain peaks, in which it combines with the oldest quarters of Cuzco to formthe shape of an immense feline—a puma, the closest creature in the Americas toan old world lion. The river Tullumayo (now diverted underground where it passesthrough the city) used to serve as the spine of this ancient lion. The torso wasthe spit of land between the Tullamayo to the east and the river Huatnay (nowalso underground) to the west. Sacsayhuaman is still recognizable as the head ofthe lion. The zig-zag walls, that Jesus Gamarra attributes to the second (UranPacha) episode of civilization in the Andes, outline the upper side of its snoutand muzzle, with the snout facing due west, the direction of the equinox sunset,just as the Great Sphinx of Giza faces due east, the direction of the equinoxsunrise.13 [part0124.html#chapter17-13]image [../images/00065.jpeg]Figure 62: The Cuzco-Sacsayhuaman “puma.”There are traditions, supported by some modern excavations, of a network oftunnels under the Sphinx where mysterious treasures lie concealed.14[part0124.html#chapter17-14] There are virtually identical traditions—againsupported by recent excavations—of a labyrinth of enormously long tunnels underthe head of the Sacsayhuaman lion “into which people descend to be lost forever,or to emerge, gibbering, mad, clutching items of treasure.”15[part0124.html#chapter17-15]Before we leave Sacsayhuaman, Jesus Gamarra takes me to a very strange place afew hundred meters to the northeast of the megalithic walls, where a narrowstairway with a dozen steps appears to have been molded—not cut—into the midstof a massive boulder 20 feet high and as many wide. The stairway would only havebeen visible from above when it was made, but the boulder has been split intotwo parts—by an earthquake, Gamarra thinks—with one side standing upright andthe other leaning away from it at an angle of about 40 degrees, thus exposingthe steps which we approach from ground level. At the point where the lowest ofthe steps would originally have touched the earth, Gamarra shows me the entranceto what looks like a deep, dark hole, now filled up with slabs of rock. “It’s atunnel,” he tells me. “It goes under the ground all the way to Cuzco, but thegovernment blocked the entrance to stop people exploring it.”Civilizing missionOver the next few days Jesus Gamarra shows me more of the evidence behind histheory. Indeed now that I’ve understood his reasoning, I can see exampleseverywhere.In downtown Cuzco—the name of the city means “the navel of the earth” in theQuechua language of the Incas16 [part0124.html#chapter17-16]—he takes me to theancient temple known as the Coricancha, which was converted into a cathedralafter the Spanish conquest. The temple was used by the Incas, indeed it wascentral to their sacred life, but Gamarra does not believe that the Incas builtit. In his view, though they undertook some repairs and added some minorconstructions of their own, the bulk of the polished, precise, sharply angledgray granite stonework is from the Uran Pacha (“second world”) period and thuspredates the Incas by thousands of years. He’s reluctant to commit to atimescale, but suggests that the Coricancha was originally raised up “more than20,000 years ago” in order to venerate an even earlier Hanan Pacha (“firstworld”) monolithic site—the original “uncovered navel stone” from which the cityderives its name.17 [part0124.html#chapter17-17]The Incas preserved a tradition, passed down to us by Garcilaso Inca de la Vega,concerning the foundation of Cuzco. It seems that some sort of cataclysm hadaffected the world, some sort of disaster, and the inhabitants of the Andes hadfallen into a very lowly state. Garcilaso was told by his own uncle, an Incanobleman, that the people of that far-off time “lived like wild beasts, withneither order nor religion, neither villages nor houses, neither fields norclothing … They lived in grottoes and caves and, like wild game, fed upon grassand roots, wild fruits, and even human flesh … Seeing the condition they werein, our father the Sun was ashamed for them, and he decided to send one of hissons and one of his daughters from heaven to earth” to bring them the gifts ofcivilization and to teach them “to obey his laws and precepts … to build housesand assemble together in villages.”18 [part0124.html#chapter17-18]This royal couple—for, like Isis and Osiris in Egypt they were brother andsister as well as husband and wife—traveled the land carrying a golden rod givento them by the Sun God, who instructed them to plunge it into the earth atvarious points until they found a place where it would disappear at one thrustand there they were to establish their court. Finally, “the Inca and his brideentered into Cuzco valley. There [at a spot called Cuzco Cara Urumi, theUncovered Navel Stone] they tried their rod and not only did it sink into theearth, but it disappeared entirely … Thus our imperial city came intoexistence.”19 [part0124.html#chapter17-19]There is an exact parallel here to the story of the Zoroastrian patriarch Yima,recounted in Chapter Seven, who was given a golden poniard by a god and wholikewise plunged it into the earth as the founding act of a civilization.And what a civilization it was that flowered in the Andes! Certainly theextraordinary accomplishment of the giant edifices of the Coricancha seems tosuggest the application of more than ordinary skills and abilities. The hugegranite blocks are so finely cut—Gamarra insists they were molded intoshape—that the towering inner chambers look more like the parts of somegigantic, sophisticated machine than of a temple. Adding to this impression arethe complicated series of grooves, channels, holes and niches indented intoseveral of the blocks, giving them the appearance of printed circuit boards fromwhich the circuitry has been removed, leaving only empty tracks.After spending some hours inside the Coricancha, Gamarra takes me outside intothe neighboring Loreto Street which he promises will provide a particularlygraphic demonstration of his arguments. It’s a narrow alley bounded by highwalls and in these walls, surmounted by sections of modern plasterwork, fourdistinctly different styles of stone masonry are visible. Of these, Gamarrasays, two are Inca, Ukun Pacha, one is from the colonial period around theseventeenth or eighteenth century, and one dates back to the Uran Pacha period.Along a large part of one side of the street there are granite blocks that areevery bit as fine and beautifully fitted as those inside the Coricancha. Indeed,this section of the wall is the exterior elevation of one of the Coricancha’slarge chambers, and therefore, according to Gamarra, is from the Uran Pachaperiod. The joints between the blocks are so thin, and yet so complex, withinterlocking elements, that they do indeed seem molded together. In addition—andhe has previously shown me examples of this at Sacsayhuaman as well—there is acurious glassy sheen around the joints, which he believes is evidence of“vitrification caused by exposure to intense heat.” He makes a convincing casethat what we’re looking at is different from the normal shine that passers-bymight impart to the stone by rubbing and touching it over the centuries. Indeedthe “vitrified” elements—and I make no claim that this is what they are—form aclear skin over the underlying blocks that is particularly evident where areashave been damaged or broken.Beside the courses of Uran Pacha blocks, though not rising to the same height,are others that look superficially similar but that, on closer examination,prove to be much more crudely made with obvious tool marks, no glassy sheen andyawning gaps between some of the joints. “Good Ukun Pacha work,” commentsGamarra. “Made by the Incas. They were doing their best to imitate the UranPacha style, but they couldn’t quite succeed and their efforts got poorer andpoorer.”He indicates four courses of irregular cobbles higher up with wide spacesbetween the joints filled by adobe. “Colonial period,” he says.Finally he takes me to the other side of the street to show me a long section ofdry-stone wall. The cobbles have been subjected to a certain amount of shaping,but are clumsily and unevenly fitted together. There’s no adobe in the gapingjoints. “Made by the Incas,” says Gamarra.“And what’s the opinion of the archaeologists?” I ask.A grin. “They recognize the colonial work, but they’ve fooled themselves intobelieving that everything else was done by the Incas. They are so convincedthere was no earlier, more advanced civilization here, that they’re blind to thehuge differences between the Uran Pacha blocks and the Inca workmanship.”“I suppose the fact that the Incas themselves sometimes attempted to imitate theUran Pacha style—at least in that section over there—makes things morecomplicated?”“More complicated, yes. But still they should be able to see. Such profoundchanges in the quality of workmanship, especially when examples like this arefound all over the region, should give the hint that different cultures wereinvolved.”Sacred valleyIf the focus around the Coricancha is the fine megalithic work that Gamarraassociates with the Uran Pacha period, there are many other structures in thearea that he sees as pure Hanan Pacha—the oldest phase of Andean civilization,where the work in stone is entirely monolithic. Several great outcrops ofbedrock have been completely refashioned into bizarre complexes of steps,terraces and alcoves. At Qenko, one such outcrop a little way beyondSacsayhuaman, there are multiple snake-like grooves and channels winding theirway down the sides of a mystic dome filled with caves, ledges, passageways andhidden niches. On the very top, again carved—or molded—from the raw stone, is anoval protrusion surmounted by a stubby double prong. There are also the outlinesof various animals—a puma, a condor, a llama—and yet more terraces and stepsleading nowhere.image [../images/00066.jpeg]Figure 63We go on to another sculpted outcrop a hundred meters tall known locally as theTemple of the Moon. At the base of the mound there’s a dark, mysterious, foldedslit that leads within, along the edge of which, at about shoulder height,emerges the sinuous sculpted form of a serpent with a strange bulbous head. Tothe right of the entrance the rock takes distinctive shape as the head of anelephant, complete with trunk, eyes and ears. About the serpent there’s nodoubt, but is the elephant an example of what psychologists call pareidolia—thehuman tendency to see meaningful shapes and patterns that don’t really exist? Ordid some cunning artist in ancient times deliberately set out to sculpt theappearance of an elephant emerging from the rock? If the latter, then we have aproblem with history, since the last species related to elephants that could beportrayed here—Cuvieronius—became extinct in South America at least six thousandyears ago, while the Incas who are supposed to have made the Temple of the Moondate back less than a thousand years.I’ll have more to say about the serpent, and the “elephant,” later. Meanwhile,as I stoop down through the slit in the rock to enter the temple I noticeanother carved stone animal—a puma, this time, and somewhat damaged—at my feet.Now I’m inside what feels like the womb of the mountain, and a soft velvetygloom envelops me. The cave is five meters wide with an organic, meandering feelto it, but to my left a couple of deep alcoves have been cut into the wall,while twenty meters ahead a shaft of brilliant, golden light finds its way inthrough some aperture in the rocky mound above and illuminates a stone plinthabout a meter and a half high with two large steps. I climb up onto the plinthand sit there, my back resting against the living rock, deep in thought.Gamarra says this place is from the most ancient Hanan Pacha epoch, that it hasnothing to do with the Incas, and that it long predates the Uran Pacha periodthat was responsible for the megaliths of Sacsayhuaman and the stunning,high-precision architecture of the Coricancha. Looking around, taking in theatmosphere, I’m more and more inclined to agree with him. The people who madethis cave temple were not the same as those who made the Coricancha. It’s notjust different building styles that are involved in each of the differentperiods. It’s a different ethic and a different spiritual heartbeat.From the Temple of the Moon we go straight on to Pisac, a drive of eighteenkilometers along the edge of the Sacred Valley of the Vilcanota River. Itswaters sparkle far below us, while all around the spectacular mountain countryglows emerald, thanks to countless fertile terraces that the Incas undoubtedlydid create and that provided their empire with vast agricultural wealth. Thesheer magnitude of the task of organizing and building the thousands uponthousands of neat dry-stone walls that hem in these terraces—which are found inevery viable spot throughout the length and breadth of the Andes—almost beggarsbelief. It’s a comparable achievement to the architectural wonders. And so tooare many other aspects of Inca civilization—which I do not mean to diminish inany way with the suggestion that there might have been earlier cultures. Quitethe contrary, I suspect part of the reason the Incas were so remarkable is thatthey were the inheritors of an incredible legacy of wisdom and knowledge fromthe past.So it’s in a setting of great natural beauty overlooking the Sacred Valley thatwe explore Pisac, a site less famous, but in many ways more spectacular thanMachu Picchu, which lies another seventy kilometers to the northwest.As at Machu Picchu, the centerpiece at Pisac, around which everything else seemsfocused, is an Intihuatana (the word means “hitching post of the sun”)—a massiveoutcrop of rock, shaped by human hands in what Gamarra calls the Hanan Pachastyle, with a gnomon sticking up from its summit. Surrounding it, and in somecases molded to its surface, are walls of beautifully shaped polygonal blocks inthe later Uran Pacha style, which seem to have been designed to cradle andprotect the Intihuatana. And around them are Ukun Pacha—Inca—structures ofsimpler, cruder stonework.“Each of these cultures,” Gamarra explains, “venerated and respected the culturethat went before. They expressed their feelings of respect by building over andaround the work of their predecessors and by attempting to copy what they did.As I showed you in Loreto Street, the Incas sought to emulate the Uran Pachastyle, but they didn’t have the knowledge or the right conditions to do such agood job.”By “the right conditions” Gamarra means the lowered gravity and greatermalleability of stone that he hypothesises in past epochs, but I don’t need toembrace that to accept that his observations about the different building stylesand their likely origination by different cultures make complete sense of whatwe’re looking at.I see many more examples of these three distinctive styles, sometimes withGamarra to guide me, sometimes not. Machu Picchu itself, which I’ve writtenabout at length in previous books, is, of course, the archetypal Hanan Pachasite adopted and overbuilt by later cultures. Then there’s a mysterious littlecave overlooking a remote valley, through the floor of which passes the railtrack connecting Cuzco to Machu Picchu.20 [part0124.html#chapter17-20] It’squite a clamber three hundred meters up the almost sheer valley side and along anarrow track, but the end result is worth the effort. At the front of the cave(see Plate 60) a black andesite boulder has been sculpted—or molded?—into acurious-looking shrine with a step-pyramid motif engraved upon it.Treasure hunters have been here and dynamited the shrine, but enough of itsurvived the explosion to get a sense of how beautiful it must have been beforeit was attacked. In the same Hanan Pacha style, one wall of the cave appears tohave been planed smooth and an alcove with absolutely precise straight edges, asthough milled by a machine tool, has been cut into it. But on the other side, onmy right as I look out of the cave, an Inca wall of rough stone mortaredtogether with adobe has been built, and into this wall—crudely done—six alcoveshave been fashioned in an obvious attempt to mimic the high-precision rock-cutalcove on the left. The qualities and styles of workmanship are so completelydifferent that it makes no sense, as is presently the case, to insist that boththe rock-cut work and the crude wall were produced by the same culture.Gamarra’s theory that a much older monument has been honored and mimicked by theIncas better fits the evidence before my eyes.Déjà vuHeading out of Peru on our way to Bolivia, we stop in the town of Puno on theshores of Lake Titicaca, 3,812 meters (12,507 feet) above sea level and fromthere, the next day we drive 22 kilometers south to a dramatic mesa at analtitude of 4,023 meters (13,198 feet), on top of which is perched thearchaeological site of Cutimbo. The main features of the site—several talltowers, some circular, some square, and known collectively as chullapas—arevisible from the road. They are thought to have been built as tombs for thenobility of a local Indian culture, the Lupakas, who were made vassals of theIncas in the period between AD 1470 and AD 1532.21 [part0124.html#chapter17-21]Undoubtedly there were burials within the chullapas in that period,22[part0124.html#chapter17-22] but the possibility must be considered that thesewere intrusive and that the towers, made from fine polygonal blocks that haveall the hallmarks of Jesus Gamarra’s Uran Pacha style, are much older than theirlatest use.I’m getting accustomed to the thin air of the Andes by now, but it’s a long hikethrough yellow pampas grass up the side of the mesa under a burning morning sun.Once we get to the top, however, my fatigue vanishes when I start finding, andSantha starts photographing, really interesting imagery carved in high relief onthe sides of a number of the towers and on scattered blocks lying at random hereand there, the result of more demolition efforts by treasure hunters.It’s this imagery, on the far side of the world, including that stone serpent inthe Temple of the Moon, that a year later will suddenly come to mind inŞanlIurfa Museum, as I study the collection of reliefs from Göbekli Tepe. Ileave readers to form their own views from Plates 61–72, but the obviousparallels include the following:At Göbekli Tepe there is a creature, sculpted in high-relief, identified byKlaus Schmidt as a beast of prey with splayed claws and powerful shoulders, itstail bent to its left over its body. A very similar animal is seen at Cutimbowith the same splayed claws and the same powerful shoulders, while the tailinstead of being bent to its left is bent to its right.At both Göbekli Tepe and Cutimbo, reliefs of salamanders and of serpents arefound. The style of execution in all cases is very similar.At about the level of the genitals of the so-called “Totem Pole” of GöbekliTepe, a small head and two arms protrude. The head has a determined look, withprominent brows. The long fingers of the hands almost meet. The posture is thatof a man leaning down through the stone and playing a drum. This is also theposture of two figures at Cutimbo, who emerge from a large convex block on oneof the circular towers. They have the same determined features and prominentbrow ridges as the figure on the “Totem Pole.”The two serpents on the side of the “Totem Pole” have peculiarly large heads,making them look almost like sperm. So, too, does the serpent that emerges fromthe dark narrow entrance of the Temple of the Moon above Cuzco.Lions feature in the reliefs at Göbekli Tepe, pumas feature in the reliefs atCutimbo and again the manner of representation is similar.I don’t know what to make of these similarities. Just coincidences? Very likely.Even so they go on.City of ViracochaIt’s quite a trial crossing the land border from Peru into Bolivia through aseries of bureaucratic hurdles and long queues, but close by is thecharmingly-named town of Copacabana and a comfortable hotel overlooking LakeTiticaca. If we had more time we’d visit the Islands of the Sun and Moon by boatfrom here; but we’ve been to them often before and they’re not our target onthis trip. It’s Tiahuanaco up on the Altiplano at 12,800 feet, near thesoutheastern shore of the giant lake, that we’re keen to get back to.Orthodox archaeologists date Tiahuanaco to the period between 1580 BC and AD724, but in both Fingerprints of the Gods and Heaven’s Mirror I argued that itmight ultimately prove to be many thousands of years older than that. Up to nowless than two percent of the site has been excavated and I think it likely thatfurther excavations will force a change of the archaeological paradigm. It isperhaps a sign of things to come that on 27 March 2015 Bolivia’s TiahuanacoArcheological Research Center reported that a survey with ground-penetratingradar had revealed the existence of a complete “buried pyramid” in a previouslyunexcavated area of the site, together with “a number of underground anomalies”that are thought to be monoliths. A five-year plan of excavation to learn moreabout these mysterious structures has now been launched.23[part0124.html#chapter17-23]image [../images/00067.jpeg]Figure 64Since I’ve already described Tiahuanaco at length in my previous books, it seemssuperfluous to repeat those descriptions here. What’s new for me on my October2013 visit is a much closer look at the machine-age precision of the megalithslittered around the immense platform of the Puma Punku, and the truly intricatemanner in which so much of the stone has been cut—molded, I think Jesus Gamarrawould say. As at the Coricancha, I come across several megaliths that resemblecircuit boards stripped of their circuits. There are others with cross-shapedindentations that look as though they were part of some contraption—as thoughperhaps they were to receive the ends of metal axles, or connecting pieces thathave long since oxidized or been carried off by looters.Particularly striking, because I’ve missed them before on all previous visits,are a couple of rows of massive andesite blocks all identical, as though stampedout of some mold, and all shaped like the letter “H.” The comparison with the“H” motif at Göbekli Tepe, on the belts of the pillars, for example, isirresistible even if it is just another coincidence (see Plates 75 and 76).image [../images/00068.jpeg]Figure 65: The principal structures of Tiahuanaco.image [../images/00069.jpeg]Figure 66: Above artist’s impression of Toxodon. Below the imagery on the pillarin the semi-subterranean temple at Tiahuanaco (left, photograph; right,highlighted).Then there’s the pillar statue in the semi-subterranean temple at Tiahuanaco.Like the Totem Pole of Göbekli Tepe, it is anthropomorphic. Like the Totem Poleat Göbekli Tepe, it has serpents writhing up its side. Like the Totem Pole atGöbekli Tepe, the long fingers of its hands almost meet in front of its body.The face is human not animal, however, and it’s heavily bearded. Nonetheless,the figure of an animal is carved on the side of its head and this animalresembles no known species more closely than it does Toxodon (see illustrationabove), a sort of New World rhino that went extinct during the cataclysms at theend of the Ice Age around 12,000 years ago. This isn’t pareidolia—the figure isdefinitely there. So there’s only one question—and it’s difficult to answer: isthis a depiction of Toxodon, or is it some creature of the artist’s imagination?I move on into the Kalasasaya, the huge open rectangle, bounded by megalithicwalls, that appears to have been the central ceremonial area of ancientTiahuanaco. On the monolithic Gateway of the Sun is carved the image of anotherelephant with tusks and trunk, like the elephant sculpted into the livingbedrock of the Temple of the Moon near Sacsayhuaman. This Tiahuanaco “elephant”has been dismissed by critics as merely the heads of two condors side by side,but if that is the case, then the image on the matching—mirror—side of theGateway is puzzling (see illustration below), since it definitely shows twocondors side by side yet is different from the elephant relief.If it was modeled from nature it doesn’t have to be that old—Cuvieronius, asnoted earlier, survived in South America until 6,000 years ago. On the otherhand, most related mastodon species went extinct during the Younger Dryasbetween 12,800 and 11,600 years ago.image [../images/00070.jpeg]Figure 67: An elephant on the Gateway of the Sun? Or just two condors side byside?The Kalaysasaya is a huge, largely empty, open space. But there are two statueshere that I want to take another look at—the Ponce Monolith, named after CarlosPonce Sanginés, the “godfather” of Bolivian archaeology, and El Fraile (“theFriar”) a smaller, slightly different version done in the same general style.What’s striking about both of them are the hand positions, with the fingersalmost meeting across the belly—virtually identical to the hand positions on theGöbekli Tepi pillars or on the Totem Pole. However, the Tiahuanaco figures, likethe Mesopotamian Apkallus, carry objects in their hands—not a cone and a bucketbut, as archaeologist and ethnobotanist Constantino Manuel Torres hasdemonstrated, snuff trays for the consumption of hallucinogenic DMT powders fromthe Amazon.24 [part0124.html#chapter17-24]It’s a reminder, even up here in the cold, austere highlands of the Altiplano,that the Amazon with its riotous, exuberant life is not far away. When we arelooking for the remnants of a lost civilization that once perhaps spanned theglobe, it might not be the first place we would think of, but its dense jungleshide so much and recent clearances have revealed the remains of ancient cities,megaliths, gigantic earthworks and soils enriched by some mysterious processthat keeps them fertile for thousands of years.25 [part0124.html#chapter17-25]What is also clear is that a legacy of high-level scientific skills, inheritedfrom somewhere, was passed down through generation after generation of shamans.The making of a psychedelic, DMT-containing brew—Ayahuasca—from two jungleplants, neither of which is an orally active psychedelic in its own right, is anastonishing pharmacological achievement when we remember that there are 150,000different species of plants and trees in the Amazon. Likewise a nerve poisonlike Curare, which has eleven different ingredients and which produces lethalfumes during preparation, is not something that can be dreamed up overnight, butrequires the application of a thoroughly worked-out science.Another point of interest about the Tiahuanaco monoliths is that their garmentsfrom the waist down are patterned in the form of fish scales. Here, too, is aparallel to the Apkallus—the bearded, “fish-garbed figures” who brought highcivilization to Mesopotamia and whose mysteries we explored in earlier chapters.Nor is it as though bearded figures are missing from the repertoire ofTiahuanaco. Two have survived, and one on the pillar in the semi-subterraneantemple has been identified since time immemorial with the great civilizing deityKon-Tiki Viracocha, who I wrote about at length in my previous books and who isdescribed in multiple myths and traditions as being white skinned and bearded.Garcilaso Inca de La Vega, who lived through the last years of the conquest andgrew up in Cuzco, wrote that Viracocha:wore a thick beard—whereas the Indians are clean shaven—and his robe came downto the ground, while that of the Incas came only to their knees; this is why thePeruvian people called the Spanish “Viracochas” the minute they saw them … TheIndians had no difficulty believing that the Spaniards were all the sons ofGod …26 [part0124.html#chapter17-26]In other words, with their white skins and beards the Spanish fitted an ancienttribal memory, passed down from generation to generation, of civilizing heroeswho had come to the Andes in remote prehistory and taught the people there theskills of agriculture, architecture and engineering.And what about Kon-Tiki Viracocha himself? What happened to him?It seems after a civilizing mission across the Americas:His travels took him to Manta (Ecuador) from where he crossed the Pacific Ocean,walking on the water.27 [part0124.html#chapter17-27]I am not going to repeat here the stories and traditions of Viracocha that Ireported in my previous books, but he is the Osiris and the Quetzalcoatl of theAndes who comes in a time of darkness, after a great flood, bringing the giftsof civilization.That he should leave eventually, and that he should do so by some high-techmeans, “walking on the water” across the Pacific Ocean, is intriguing.Let’s follow him and see where he might have gone …"},{"pageContent":" Chapter 18 [part0131.html#c_ch18]Ocean [part0131.html#c_ch18]According to the most ancient traditions of Mesopotamia, humanity was created atthe “navel of the earth,” in uzu (flesh), sar (bond), ki (place, earth).1[part0125.html#chapter18-1] In the Rig Veda, the most ancient scripture ofIndia, the universe was born and developed “from a core, a central point.”2[part0125.html#chapter18-2] Bearing markings that Jesus Gamarra would instantlynominate as belonging to the oldest, Hanan Pacha, style of the Andes, theShetiyah—Foundation Stone—of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, now the “rock” ofthe Dome of the Rock (see Chapter Twelve), is considered to be “the center ofthe earth.”3 [part0125.html#chapter18-3] Indeed this notion that there arecertain primordial centers of creation from which all else grows is a globaltheme of ancient religion and mythology:The Most Holy One created the world like an embryo. As the embryo grows from thenavel, so God began to create the world by the navel and from there it spreadout in all directions.4 [part0125.html#chapter18-4]In the Greek myth of the universal Deluge, sent by Zeus to punish mankind forwickedness, the only survivors are Deucalion and Pyrrha. Their Ark comes to reston Mount Parnassus, high above Delphi, a site regarded throughout classicalantiquity as the “navel of the earth.”5 [part0125.html#chapter18-5] Just asHeliopolis in Egypt possessed the sacred Benben, a betyl stone fallen fromheaven (see Chapter Eleven), so too Delphi possessed a betyl, nominated as itsomphalos, or “navel stone.” It was specifically identified in Greek mythology asthe stone which had been fed to the monstrous time-god Kronos—who devoured hisown children—in place of the infant Zeus. When Zeus grew to manhood, he tookrevenge on Kronos, “driving him from the sky to the very depths of the universe”after first—in imagery that calls to mind the debris stream of a comet—forcinghim to vomit up the stone.6 [part0125.html#chapter18-6] “It landed in the exactcenter of the world, in the shrine at Delphi.”7 [part0125.html#chapter18-7]We saw in the last chapter that the name of Cuzco, the megalithic city in thePeruvian Andes, means “the navel of the earth.” More than 4,000 kilometers(2,500 miles) to the southwest, across the Pacific Ocean, the ancient name ofEaster Island, Te-Pito-O-Te-Henua, also means “the navel of the earth”8[part0125.html#chapter18-8]—which in turn has affinities to the ancient name ofTiahuanaco, Taypicala, “the stone at the center.”9 [part0125.html#chapter18-9]Indeed, on the edge of Easter Island’s La Perouse Bay there is a mysteriousspherical, carefully-tooled stone called Te-Pito-Kura—the “golden navelstone”—which is regarded as the navel of the island itself.10[part0125.html#chapter18-10]Traditions state that there was once a time when “great magicians” used thisstone to focus their mana power—literally “sorcery”—to make the Moai, the famousmegalithic statues of the island “walk” from the quarry to the places where theywere to be set up.11 [part0125.html#chapter18-11] An almost identical notion ispreserved among the indigenous Aymara of Bolivia, who have lived in the vicinityof Tiahuanaco since time immemorial. They state that the mysterious city withits own extraordinary megalithic statues was built by magic in a single nightand that “the stones came down of their own accord, or at the sound of atrumpet, from the mountain quarries and took up their proper positions at thesite.”12 [part0125.html#chapter18-12]image [../images/00071.jpeg]Figure 68: Easter Island and its region. (After Eric Gaba, Wikimedia Commons).Nor do the parallels stop there. Since the late 1940s, when Thor Heyerdahlundertook his Kon-Tiki expedition (named after Kon-Tiki Viracocha, thecivilizing deity of Tiahuanaco, whom we met at the end of the last chapter), ithas been noticed that there are similarities between the statues of Tiahuanacoand the Moai of Easter Island. For example, as we’ve seen, the figures ofViracocha at Tiahuanaco display prominent and pronounced beards (a sharpcontrast to the indigenous inhabitants of the Andes who are not able to growstrong beards) and there is no doubt that the prominent chins of the EasterIsland figures are also meant to represent beards (Plates 78 and 79). AsHeyerdahl commented:The statues on Easter Island … had their chins carved pointed and projecting,because the sculptors themselves grew beards.13 [part0125.html#chapter18-13]The Norwegian adventurer was likewise struck by the way that the Easter Islandfigures and the Tiahuanaco figures have “their hands laid in position on theirstomachs.”14 [part0125.html#chapter18-14] Both also wear distinctive broadbelts. “The sole decoration of the Easter Island figures,” he wrote:is a belt which was always carved round the figure’s stomach. The same symbolicbelt is to be found on every single statue in Kon-Tiki’s ancient ruins by LakeTiticaca.15 [part0125.html#chapter18-15]Heyerdahl, who I had the privilege to know and who was a strong supporter of thelost civilization hypothesis,16 [part0125.html#chapter18-16] did not have theopportunity to visit Göbekli Tepe before he passed away in 2002. Had he done so,however, I think he would have been struck by the resemblance between the handpositions depicted on the “Totem Pole” figure from Göbekli Tepe and the handpositions on the Viracocha pillar statue and on the Ponce and El Frailemonoliths at Tiahuanaco. I pointed these resemblances out in the last chapter,but there’s more.For example, the larger anthropomorphic pillars at Göbekli Tepe feature thicksculpted belts very similar to those seen on the Tiahuanaco and Easter Islandfigures. Also noteworthy are the hand positions seen on the larger Göbekli Tepepillars, with long fingers placed forward and almost meeting across the belly.Identical hand positions are seen on the Easter Island Moai. Last but not least,just as Easter Island, Tiahuanaco and Cuzco share the odd concept of being“navels of the earth,” so too does Göbekli Tepe; whether expressed in Turkish,or in the Armenian language as Portasar, its very name means “the hill of thenavel.”17 [part0125.html#chapter18-17]If all these are coincidences then their profusion is ratherextraordinary—unless, of course, the same Magicians of the Gods who created andthen buried the Göbekli Tepe time capsule at the end of the Younger Dryas some11,600 years ago were also at work in Easter Island.Unless, in other words, the Moai of Easter Island are older—much older—thanarchaeologists think they are …A remnant of antediluvian lands?Archaeologists believe that the oldest of the Easter Island Moai was made aroundAD 690 and the youngest about a thousand years later in AD 1650. This chronologyis based on radiocarbon dating which also puts the earliest human settlement onthe island at AD 318.18 [part0125.html#chapter18-18] As we have seen, however,radiocarbon cannot date stone monuments directly. Inferences have to be madeabout the relationship between the organic materials that have been dated andthe stone, and sometimes these inferences can be extremely misleading.For example, it would be a mistake to conclude that the Ahu (platform) at AhuNau Nau on Anakena Bay is the same age as the seven Moai mounted on it. Theplatform is obviously the work of a later culture that must have re-erected thestatues because, incorporated in the masonry of the platform itself, an ancientand heavily weathered Moai head has been reused as a construction block.Likewise, if, for example, human beings had settled here during the YoungerDryas when sea level was much lower than it is today, and Easter Island was partof a chain of steep and narrow antediluvian islands as long as the Andesmountain range, then how much in the way of organic materials would they haveleft for archaeologists to carbon date? Perhaps the peak of the East PacificRise that we now know as Easter Island was not used for residential purposes atall, but kept exclusively for religious ceremonies in which the great monolithicstatues played a part? Perhaps people came from other parts of the archipelagoto attend those ceremonies and then returned to their home islands—islands thatare all now underwater?This is conjecture, of course, pure speculation, but it is temptingly suggestedby a legend of the Easter Islanders themselves concerning a supernatural beingcalled Uoke who in remote times:traveled around the Pacific with a gigantic lever with which he pried up wholeislands and tossed them into the sea where they vanished forever under thewaves. After thus destroying many islands he came at length to the coast ofTe-Pito-O-Te-Henua, then a much larger land than it is today. He began to leverup parts of it and cast them into the sea. Eventually he reached a place calledPuko Pihipuhi … in the vicinity of Hanga Hoonu [La Perouse Bay, site of the“golden navel stone”]. Here the rocks of the island were too sturdy for Uoke’slever, and it was broken against them. He was unable to dispose of the lastfragment, and this remained as the island we know today. Thus Te-Pito-O-Te-Henuacontinues to exist only through the accident of Uoke’s broken lever.19[part0125.html#chapter18-19]Legends also speak of a primeval Pacific homeland called “Hiva” from which thefirst inhabitants of Easter Island came—a homeland that also fell victim to the“mischief of Uoke’s lever” and was “submerged under the sea.” What isparticularly intriguing about all this, because of its resonance with the SevenSages—the Apkallu—spoken of in Mesopotamian antediluvian traditions, and withthe Seven Sages of the Edfu Building Texts, who sought out new lands in which torecreate the drowned and devastated world of the gods, is that SevenSages—“kings’ sons, all initiated men”—are also said to have been instrumentalin the original settlement of Easter Island.20 [part0125.html#chapter18-20]Exactly as was the case with the Apkallu, who laid the foundations of all thefuture temples of Mesopotamia, and with the Edfu Sages who traveled the lengthand breadth of Egypt establishing the sacred mounds on which all future pyramidsand temples were to be built, the first task of the Seven Sages from Hiva aftertheir arrival on Easter Island was “the construction of stone mounds.”21[part0125.html#chapter18-21]Could there be anything to this? Is it possible that the Moai statues of EasterIsland are the work of the survivors of a lost civilization dating back to theIce Age 12,000 or more years ago?One possible hint comes from a discovery made by Dr. Robert J. Menzies, Directorof Ocean Research at the Duke University Marine Laboratory, Beaufort, NorthCarolina. In 1966 Menzies led a six-week oceanographic investigation of thePacific off the coast of Peru and Ecuador in the waters of the Milne–EdwardsDeep, a trench that drops off in places to almost 19,000 feet (5,791 meters).Dr. Menzies’ research vessel, the Anton Bruun, deployed underwater cameras thatwere state of the art at the time and about 55 miles west of Callao (the port ofLima, capital of Peru), at a depth of 6,000 feet in an area prone to marinesubsidence, “strange carved rock columns” were photographed on the sea bed:22[part0125.html#chapter18-22]Two upright columns, about two feet or more in diameter, were sighted extendingfive feet out of the mud. Two more had fallen down and were partially buried,and another angular squarish block was seen.23 [part0125.html#chapter18-23]“We did not find structures like these anywhere else,” commented Dr. Menzies inan interview with Science News. “I have never seen anything like this before.”24[part0125.html#chapter18-24] The later official report of the cruise of theresearch vessel added that one of the columns bore markings that appeared to be“inscriptions.”25 [part0125.html#chapter18-25]So far as I have been able to establish Dr. Menzies’ discovery, which hints at areal basis to the submerged land of Hiva, was never followed up. Meanwhile whatof Easter Island itself, where the survivors are said to have settled in orderto reconstitute their lost world? The science of geology has some clues for usto consider.What lies beneath …Professor Robert Schoch of Boston University, renowned for his geologicalredating of the Great Sphinx of Giza, does not easily or quickly bestow greaterantiquity on monuments than is allowed by mainstream archaeology. Most often hegoes with the orthodox chronology but when he diverges, as he has with the GreatSphinx, and with Gunung Padang in Indonesia (see Chapter Two), it is onlybecause he has first been persuaded by strong geological evidence thatarchaeology has overlooked.This is the case with his analysis of the Moai statues of Easter Island. Here’shis considered opinion after a research visit:I was particularly impressed by the varying degrees of weathering and erosionseen on the different moai, which could be telltale signs of major discrepanciesin their ages. The levels of sedimentation around certain moai also impressedme. Some moai have been buried in up to an estimated six meters of sediment, ormore, such that even though they are standing erect, only their chins and headsare above the current ground level. Such high levels of sedimentation couldoccur quickly, for instance if there were catastrophic landslides, mudflows, orpossibly tsunamis washing over the island, but I could not find any suchevidence (and landslides or tsunamis would tend to shift and knock over the tallstatues). Rather, to my eye, the sedimentation around certain moai suggests amuch more extreme antiquity than most conventional archaeologists and historiansbelieve to be the case—or believe to be possible.26 [part0125.html#chapter18-26]Schoch adds that he has begun to collect evidence on typical weathering, erosionand sedimentation rates on Easter Island during the modern period since recordsbegan to be kept. “So far it seems that sedimentation over the past century hasbeen on the whole relatively modest.”27 [part0125.html#chapter18-27]As usual, Schoch understates his case, which is best illustrated at Rano Rarakucrater, an extinct volcanic caldera that served as the principal quarry fromwhich the Easter Island Moai were extracted. The inner slopes of the caldera,leading down to a small, reed-fringed lake, are lined with an estimated 270statues in various stages of completion. Some lie on their backs or sides, manyare perfectly upright, others jut at various crazy angles out of the ground, andthe overall impression is one of some extraordinary Surrealist show interruptedin mid-preparation and abandoned forever by the artist.What it was all about, what it was all for, no one can honestly say, thoughthere are many theories. Nonetheless, the setting is unmistakably geological andthe statues are themselves first and foremost geological artifacts separatedfrom the natural bedrock, yet still sufficiently in place to have remained partof their original setting. Mostly what you see, as you wander in bemusedwonderment among them, are their serene, contemplative bearded faces, theirlong-eared heads, their shoulders, and parts of their upper torsos.You could be forgiven for imagining that this is all there is to them—that theyare set just a meter or so into the ground, sufficient to anchor them and nomore. But Thor Heyerdahl, that indefatigable adventurer and explorer, provedthis was not the case when he excavated a number of the Rano Raraku Moai in 1956and again in 1987, discovering that, like icebergs, the larger part of theirmass lies beneath the surface. Photographs from those excavations show statuesthat go down more than 9 meters (30 feet) beneath the ground into a deep thicksediment of yellow clay.28 [part0125.html#chapter18-28] Studying these images,it becomes immediately apparent that Schoch’s argument has merit and that thereis no way, in just a few hundred years (as noted earlier, archaeo-logistsmaintain that production of the Moai stopped as recently as 1650) that such amassive amount of sedimentation could have accumulated.That would be the case even if Easter Island were part of a large, continuouslandmass, where there was potential for wind and water to transport soils fromone area and deposit them in another. But Easter Island as we know it today,though an enigma of giant proportions, is just a tiny dot on the map in themidst of the world’s largest and deepest ocean. Not only is it situated morethan 2,000 miles from the coast of South America, but it is also more than 2,000miles from Tahiti, the next substantial group of islands.29[part0125.html#chapter18-29] With a total land area of just 63.2 square miles(163.6 square kilometers) it is therefore all the more inconceivable that EasterIsland itself could have contributed the 30-foot-deep sediment load seen aroundthe Moai in Rano Raraku crater. Such a volume of sedimentation might, however,have been possible more than 12,000 years ago when sea-level was lower and, aswe’ve seen, Easter Island was part of an extensive archipelago.Here, too, could be the answer to another mystery identified by Schoch, which isthe existence of a small number of Moai carved from basalt. The problem is thatthere are no deposits of basalt on Easter Island itself. Schoch speculates that:the “lost basalt quarries” might be under sea level now because they are ofextreme antiquity, and thus the basalt moai carved from them are extremelyancient. Sea levels have risen dramatically since the end of the last Ice Age,some ten thousand or more years ago, and if the basalt moai were quarried alongthe coast of Easter Island from areas since inundated by the sea, this couldhelp to date the basalt moai and is immediately suggestive that they arethousands of years older than conventionally believed to be the case.30[part0125.html#chapter18-30]The same solution—that Easter Island was once part of a much largerlandmass—would also explain another, very different puzzle, namely the so-calledRongo Rongo script.31 [part0125.html#chapter18-31] It is unprecedented in humanhistory for a sophisticated fully developed writing system to be invented andput into use by a small, isolated island community. Yet Easter Island does haveits own script, examples of which, mostly incised on wooden boards, copies ofcopies of copies of much older lost originals, were collected in the nineteenthcentury and have found their way into a number of museums around the world. Noneremain on Easter Island itself and even in the period when they were collectedno native Easter Islanders were able to read them. To this day the scriptremains undeciphered—yet another of the many enigmas of this island of mystery.The Sage of Bada ValleyIt’s 28 May 2014 and I’m thousands of miles from Easter Island in the middle ofthe Bada Valley of Central Sulawesi, in Indonesia, standing in front of a hugeMoai-like figure carved from solid basalt and deeply embedded in a grassy field.What’s striking about the statue, apart from its sheer size—the visible part,which slopes steeply over to its left, extends more than four meters (13 feet)out the ground—is the posture of its arms and hands. These are arranged inexactly the manner of the Easter Island Moai, and also of the Göbekli Tepefigures, with the arms crooked at the sides and the hands brought togetheracross the front of the belly with the fingers almost meeting. The bigdifference is that this figure, known locally as Watu Palindo, “The Wise Man,”32[part0125.html#chapter18-32] shows off an erect penis and a pair of testiclesbetween those extended fingers.How old is the “Wise Man?”“Nobody knows,” admits Iksam Kailey, Curator of the Province Museum of CentralSulawesi, who has kindly accompanied me on this sector of a long researchjourney through Indonesia, “archaeology is in its infancy in our island.” Kaileyhimself is inclined to the view that the statue, and a dozen others like it herein Bada Valley, are at least 4,000 years old.33 [part0125.html#chapter18-33]Other estimates vary between 5,000 years and less than 1,000 years,34[part0125.html#chapter18-34] but none are of the slightest value since nodefinitive archaeological dating has been done or can be done; the intrusion oforganic materials from the different cultures that have lived and farmed thisvalley for millennia, several of which have at different periods dug up WatuPalindo looking for treasure, mean that we will never get to the truth.Artifacts from the not too far distant Besoa Valley have been carbon dated to2,890 years ago,35 [part0125.html#chapter18-35] but so what? That tells usnothing at all about the age of the Wise Man.image [../images/00072.jpeg]Figure 69: The island of Sulawesi in its regional context.Getting to Bada Valley is quite a trek. Santha and I are traveling with DannyHilman Natawidjaja, the geologist who has brought the mysterious pyramid ofGunung Padang in West Java (see Chapter Two) to the attention of the world. Alsoaccompanying us is Danny’s friend and colleague Wisnu Ariastika, who has kindlylooked after the logistics of our journey. We start off in Jakarta on 26 May andfly to Palu, the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, where Iksam Kaileyjoins us on the morning of 27 May. Then we drive all day on an awesomely badroad through spectacular mountain country, reaching the town of Tentana on giantLake Poso the same evening. The following day, 28 May, we drive an additionalfifty kilometers to the village of Bomba in the heart of the Bada Valley, which,like so much of Indonesia, is stunningly beautiful, a broad flat plateau,surrounded by green mountains plumed by silver clouds that reflect magically offgleaming rice fields. Reaching Bomba by mid-morning we check into a basic butcomfortable guest house and go straight out megalith hunting.There are, essentially, two kinds of megaliths in the valley, one being verylarge stone cisterns called Kalamba, precisely cut and hollowed out within andin some cases weighing more than a ton, the other being figures like WatuPalindo weighing up to twenty tons. For two days we tramp along the borders ofwaterlogged rice fields and on rough tracks through forests. At one point wecome to a statue lying on its back in the midst of a clearing, staring up at theheavens, a little later we find another, also on its back, lying in the midst ofa river. Both show the same hand and arm positions as Watu Palindo, the Sage. Athird figure with weird, fish-like features is buried up to its neck indeep-water rice. A fourth stands lonely on a ridge gazing at a distant range ofmountains.The frustrating thing is that nothing—really nothing at all—is known about thesemegaliths. Who created them? When? Why? All is mystery.Hobbits, dragons and the FloodFrom the Bada Valley we make a long road journey to Toraja in South Sulawesi—alljourneys are long here; Sulawesi is the eleventh largest island in the world. Wespend a couple of days in the area. There is an eerie cult of the dead, whichinvolves digging up the bodies of the deceased once a year, dressing them in newclothes, combing their moldering hair, tidying their coffins and reinterringthem. Lifelike effigies of the deceased are also placed in rock-cut shrines highup in cliff faces and there are caves full of bones.What we’ve come here to see are not the dead but megaliths. This being Toraja,however, the megaliths are all about the dead and, unlike in other parts of theworld—and indeed other parts of Indonesia—they aren’t relics of a remote andforgotten past, but part of a living, active, fully functional cult. We visitBori Parinding, a site dominated by a cluster of tall, needle-like menhirs thatmight be transplanted without difficulty to any one of a dozen locations inEurope and confidently dated to 5000 years old or more. Yet Bori Parinding isjust two hundred years old.The oldest megalith here was erected in 1817. Each one is a monument to adeceased Torajan notable and new menhirs are still quarried and put in placeevery year. Those cut from andesite are mined from a nearby deposit and shapedwith hammers and metal chisels—a local elder shows me how it’s done. Those cutfrom limestone, weighing in some cases an estimated 15 tons, are brought from aquarry five kilometers away by teams of hundreds of men working in shifts formore than a week, who haul the menhirs to the site on wooden rollers.Indonesia, I’m beginning to realize, is a land where ancient traditions live onin fascinating ways and the connection to the remote past is ever present.That’s a realization that’s brought home to me all the more strongly on our nextstop, the island of Flores. We reach it by driving all day from Toraja toMakassar, where we catch a flight to Bali and thence, via Komodo, famous for itslarge predatory lizards known as “Komodo Dragons,” to Ende, the chief “city” ofFlores—a city with a population of just 60,000. In recent times, Flores hasattracted fame for the discovery on the island of the remains of Homofloresiensis, an extinct species of human that stood, in adulthood, just 1.1meters (3.5 feet tall) and has, accordingly, been dubbed “the Hobbit.” I’ll havemore to say about these creatures later, but as I land at Ende after thatstopover in Komodo I can’t help reflecting that Indonesia is truly a mythicalplace—the only country in the world today where dragons and hobbits are not thestuff of fantasy but of science.image [../images/00073.jpeg]Figure 70: The island of Flores in its regional context.Flores is charming—far out on the edge of the world, simple, lacking in manymodern conveniences, but with a sweet, gentle spirit. We base ourselves in thetown of Bajawa, and in the couple of days we spend here, we visit a number ofvillages where the tidy bamboo and thatch houses are built upon and aroundextensive megalithic monuments.In the village of Bena, about 16 kilometers from Bajawa, with distant glimpsesof the Savu Sea and of Mount Inerie, we’re shown around by Joseph, a venerableelder of 88 years. The village has two parallel rows of houses with the high,thatched roofs, triangular in cross section, that are characteristic of thearea. The houses are separated by a long and wide public space filled with anincredible assortment of menhirs and dolmens which, as with the menhirs ofToraja, would not look out of place if they were excavated from Neolithic stratain Europe. Joseph tells us that the dolmens aren’t tombs (as is usually the casein Europe), but altars used by members of each of the different clans residentin the village. From time to time buffalo sacrifices are carried out on thealtars in honor of deceased notables, and the megaliths have a function inaiding communication with the departed and in connecting the supernatural andearthly realms.Such ideas don’t syncretise well with Christianity, which is also a part ofdaily life here; indeed, at the far end of the village there is a shrine to theVirgin Mary. Joseph tells us that dolmens and menhirs were still being erectedwhen he was a young man, but that this is no longer done and the tradition isdying out. When I ask him about the origins of the megalithic cult, however, hetells me a remarkable story.“Our ancestors,” he says, “came here in a ship around 12,000 years ago during agreat flood.” Indeed it seems that the whole village is laid out incommemoration of that ship, which was propelled not by sails but by an “engine.”Joseph shows me a megalithic chamber, roughly in the middle of the village, thatsymbolizes the place where the “engine house” was located in the original ship.I ask him where all the megaliths come from and he tells me that they werebrought from 20 kilometers away on the slopes of Mount Inerie and moved intoposition by special “powers” possessed by the ancestors. He adds that “anAmerican scholar, a certain Professor Smith” has confirmed the story.This mention of the name of a foreign researcher—whose identity and bona fides Iwas not subsequently able to establish—raises the nagging possibility in my mindthat the whole tale might not be of indigenous origin at all, but might be animported concoction, a fantasy even, which Joseph believes to be true. Certainlywe were not told the same story in other megalithic villages of Flores. At WogoBaru, for example, elders spoke of a “giant” called Dhake, who was so huge thathe had single-handedly carried the megaliths down from the slopes of MountInerie.What all the accounts seem to have in common, however, is a whiff of wonder andmagic.Queen of the Southern OceanLeaving Flores, we fly from Ende via Denpasar in Bali to the city of Palembangin Sumatra, then make a two-day road journey from east to west across southSumatra. Again our focus is megaliths, but most of what we see, in the form oflarge sculpted human and anthropomorphic figures, shows the influence of Hinduand Buddhist art and thus is certainly not prehistoric. It’s only when we cometo a coffee plantation in the mountains near the city of Pagar Alam that we findsomething really interesting—a series of gigantic megalithic subterraneanchambers (see Plate 81), several of which are painted with swirling designs instriking colors of red ochre and black charcoal, amidst which animal figures canbe discerned.No dating work has been done on them, but similar chambers such as West KennetLong Barrow in England or Gavrinis in Carnac, Brittany, are more than 5,000years old, while the painted caves of France and Spain are even older, goingback 33,000 years in the case of Chauvet, for example. The Sumatran paintingshave much in common with those of southern Europe, being profoundly visionary,with characteristic “entoptic” patterns indicating that the artists wereshamans, who had experienced and were depicting visions seen in deeply alteredstates of consciousness, likely induced by psychedelic plants or fungi.36[part0125.html#chapter18-36]image [../images/00074.jpeg]Figure 71: The island of Sumatra in its regional context.We drive on to the city of Bengkulu and fly from there to Jakarta, the massive,sprawling Indonesian capital on the island of Java. Jakarta is like a giantoctopus; once it has entangled you in the tentacles of its clogged roadways, itis extremely difficult to get free. Late the same evening, however, weeventually reach our next destination, Pelabuhan Ratu on the southwest coast ofJava, facing the Indian Ocean. It’s only an overnight stop—in the morning we’llbe going to another megalithic site inland—but it turns out that Pelabuhan Ratu(which means “Harbor of the Queen”) is of interest in its own right. Indeed theSamudra Beach Hotel where we’re staying has a room—Room 308—that no one isallowed to reserve because it’s permanently set aside for the Queen of theSouthern Ocean, a kind of sea fairy or goddess, who rules over a submerged cityand occasionally appears on land to interact with mortal humans.Obviously I’m interested in submerged cities, particularly submerged citiesaround the islands of Indonesia, which were all part of a giant continent, knownto geologists as Sundaland, that was above water and connected to the rest ofSoutheast Asia until about 11,600 years ago. When sea levels rosecataclysmically at the end of the Younger Dryas, this region lost more habitableland, including a massive, low-lying plain, than almost anywhere else onearth.37 [part0125.html#chapter18-37] Although it’s close to midnight, Itherefore insist on paying a visit to Room 308, which is fully decorated andfurnished as a royal boudoir, complete with imaginative paintings of Njai LaraKidul, the Queen of the Southern Ocean.It’s a romantic story and, who knows, there may be something to it. Certainly,no attempt to uncover the mysterious origins of human civilization can afford toignore the rapid drowning of Sundaland, which was fertile and well watered withfour major river-systems before it was flooded.38 [part0125.html#chapter18-38]Indeed it’s because of this, and because much of the flooding occurred around11,600 years ago, precisely the date that Plato gives for the submergence ofAtlantis, that our traveling companion, geologist Danny Natawidjaja, believesIndonesia is Atlantis39 [part0125.html#chapter18-39] and has made such effortsto investigate the extraordinary megalithic pyramid of Gunung Padang.image [../images/00075.jpeg]Figure 72: The island of Java in its regional context.Gunung Padang, which I first visited in December 2013 (described in Chapter Two)is 120 kilometers north of us, and we’ll be going back there at the end of thistrip. Before we do, however, there’s one more site we want to see. It’s calledTugu Gede, near the village of Cengkuk, 20 kilometers into the mountains northof Pelabuhan Ratu.We set off in the morning on another of those precipitous and slightly alarmingroads that Indonesia has so many of, but once again the trip is worth it. We goas far as the car can take us and then have a long walk, first through a villagein the midst of banana plantations, and then into quite dense forest, comingeventually to a mystic glade where a massive central menhir, shaped at itssides, coming to a point like an obelisk, juts 3 meters straight up out of theearth. It is surrounded by a ring of smaller menhirs, some fallen, some stillstanding, and round about there are huge numbers of further worked stones, manywith patterns of cupules carved into them very similar to the cupules at KarahanTepe in Turkey.Tugu Gede has been the subject of some cursory excavations, but there appears tobe no clear consensus on its antiquity. The megaliths themselves are accepted asprehistoric—“thousands of years old,” although exactly how many thousands no oneseems to know—but there are also later occupation layers that have yielded uppottery and artifacts that are only a few hundred years old, and of course thesite stands close to (and is impacted by) human settlements to this day. One ofthe most anomalous finds is a small statue. On no very good grounds,archaeologists suppose it to be a representation of the Hindu god Shiva, but itbears no resemblance to any images of Shiva that I’ve seen and—to my eye atleast—looks much more like a crudely worked Ancient Egyptian figure with itscrossed hands and distinctive headdress.Mainstream archaeology does not believe that the Ancient Egyptians could havereached Indonesia, so this possibility has never been considered. However, thereis compelling evidence that long-distance oceanic voyages were undertaken fromEgypt during Pharaonic times—for example, the presence in nine mummies datedbetween 1070 BC and AD 395 of cocaine and tobacco, both indigenous Americanplants not previously thought to have been present in the Old World before thetime of Columbus.40 [part0125.html#chapter18-40]These findings by S. Balabanova, F. Parsche and W. Pirsig have been disputed byother scholars, who regard long-distance Ancient Egyptian sea voyages as apriori impossible. According to Egyptologist John Baines, for example: “The ideathat the Egyptians should have traveled to America is overall absurd … and Ialso don’t know anyone who spends time doing research in these areas, becausethey’re not perceived to be areas that have any real meaning for the subject.”41[part0125.html#chapter18-41] The way I see it, however, this comment by Bainesis more indicative of a deep-seated problem within Egyptology itself, and withinarchaeology in general, than of a problem in the factual findings of Balabanovaet al. Archaeology is too much constrained by a rigid reference frame of what ispossible and what is not, and tends to ignore, sidestep, or ridicule evidencethat challenges that reference frame. This is equally true when it comes to thecase for a lost civilization of the Ice Age, which again is dismissed on no goodgrounds other than that it is considered to be a priori impossible.Meanwhile, since the validity of Balabanova’s findings has subsequently beenvindicated,42 [part0125.html#chapter18-42] and therefore—we must assume—theAncient Egyptians did indeed make voyages as far as the Americas, I see no goodreason to ignore the possibility that they also made voyages in the otherdirection, eastward toward Indonesia and beyond. Indeed, Ancient Egyptianhieroglyphic inscriptions—though once again disputed—have been found at awilderness site near the town of Gosford, to the north of Sydney in easternAustralia. I have had the opportunity to study these glyphs myself and do notagree with the mainstream view that they can easily be dismissed astwentieth-century hoaxes. On the contrary, a recent (October 2014) decipheringof the glyphs by hieroglyphics experts Mohamed Ibrahim and Yousef Abd’el HakimAwyan concluded:Not only are the Gosford Glyphs legitimate, the scribes accurately used severalancient hieroglyphs and grammatical variations which, crucially, were not evendocumented in Egyptian hieroglyphic texts until 2012, immediately disproving alllong-standing “hoax” theories. The specific style of hieroglyphs used alsoprovides a linguistic time-frame that places an Egyptian presence in Australiaat least 2,500 years ago, while the translated text is even so detailed as toidentify the ancient scribes, by name and occupation.43[part0125.html#chapter18-43]I’m not claiming that the case is settled yet; the Gosford Glyphs may or may notbe a hoax; much more work needs to be done to settle the matter. My point,however, is that the use by orthodox archaeologists of a priori assumptionsabout what happened in the past as a reason not to conduct wide-ranginginvestigations into what actually did happen in the past is poor scholarship. Inmy view, therefore, rather than simply ruling out the possibility that theAncient Egyptians might have reached not only the Americas, but also Indonesiaand Australia, we should be asking ourselves why, and over what sort of timespan, they might have made such voyages. In particular, I wonder if it ispossible that the tradition of a drowned homeland of the gods somewhere in theeast that is so strongly expressed in the Edfu Building Texts might be connectedto this mystery.To be specific, could Indonesia, once part of the mainland of Southeast Asia andbroken up into more than 13,000 islands by cataclysmic sea-level rise at the endof the Ice Age—and perhaps particularly Java with its 45 active volcanoes—havebeen associated in the Ancient Egyptian mind with the “Isle of Fire,” which R.T.Rundle Clark describes as “the mystic land of origin beyond the horizon?”44[part0125.html#chapter18-44]The very same “Isle of Fire,” as we saw in Chapter Eleven, from which Hike, thevital, magical essence was brought by the Phoenix to Heliopolis, the symboliccenter and navel of the earth?45 [part0125.html#chapter18-45]The Isle of Fire with which Horus of Edfu was directly associated46[part0125.html#chapter18-46] and where Thoth, the Sage, the Lord of Wisdom,“made shrines for the gods and goddesses?”47 [part0125.html#chapter18-47]The dead hand of orthodox archaeologyThe final leg of our 2014 Indonesia journey takes us back to Gunung Padang, themysterious pyramid, for so long thought to be a natural hill, that geologistDanny Natawidjaja, through determined efforts, has brought to the attention ofthe world. I won’t describe it again, since I have already introduced it to thereader in Chapter Two.We’ve seen how the megalithic site of columnar basalt visible on the uppermostterraces of Gunung Padang is simply the latest episode in its long story and howDanny and his team used seismic tomography, ground-penetrating radar and otherremote-sensing technologies to show that the man-made structures go down tens ofmeters beneath the surface. Core drilling into these buried structures wasundertaken producing organic materials with impeccable provenance that yieldedever more ancient carbon dates extending back, ultimately to more than 22,000years ago—before the end of the last Ice Age, when our ancestors are supposed(according to the orthodox archaeological model) to be have been nothing morethan primitive hunter-gatherers, incapable of large-scale construction andengineering feats. Intriguingly, as I also reported in Chapter Two, the remotesensing equipment flagged up the presence deep within the pyramid of what appearto be three hidden chambers, so rectilinear in form that they are most unlikelyto be natural. The largest of these lies at a depth of between 21.3 and 27.4meters (70 to 90 feet) and measures approximately 5.5 meters (18 feet) high,13.7 meters (45 feet) long and 9.1 meters (30 feet) wide.48[part0125.html#chapter18-48]On our visit to Gunung Padang in early June 2014, excavations were still beingheld up by objections from archaeologists but by August, following a decisiveintervention by Indonesia’s then President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Danny andhis team were finally able to proceed for a first short season. Unfortunately,however, the work was halted very soon afterward, in October 2014, whenPresident Yudhoyono completed his second term of office and stepped down. Hissuccessor, President Joko Widodo, has thus far not shown the same level ofinterest in and enthusiasm for the project, perhaps because of objections fromBandung Archaeological Center Chief Desril Shanti, who launched a public attackon the Gunung Padang excavations in late September 2014, complaining that theydid not follow the standard methods that are usually applied in archaeologicalprojects. “I’ve yet to go to the site,” she said, “but I can judge it fromphotographs. An archaeological excavation method shouldn’t have been carried outin that way.”49 [part0125.html#chapter18-49] She also objected that funding hadbeen allocated to the work. This funding, she felt, should have gone to her owndepartment.50 [part0125.html#chapter18-50]At the beginning of October 2014, as the reader will recall from Chapter Two,Danny had written to me enthusiastically as follows:The research progress has been being great. We have excavated three more spotsright on top of the megalithic site in the past couple of weeks, which give moreevidence and details about the buried structures. We have uncovered lots morestone artifacts from the excavations. The existence of the pyramid-likestructure beneath the megalithic site is now loud and clear; even fornon-specialists, it is not too difficult to understand if they come and see forthemselves. We have found some kind of open hall buried by soil five to sevenmeters thick; however we have not yet got into the main chamber. We are nowdrilling to the suspected location of the chamber (based on subsurfacegeophysic) in the middle of the megalithic site.51 [part0125.html#chapter18-51]It was only a few days after Danny sent me that mail that the Presidency changedhands and the drilling and excavations were stopped. Nonetheless, the first,short, interrupted season did produce important results. As Danny confirmed inhis correspondence with me, even the relatively young layer that was all theyhad time to excavate—the second artificial columnar rock-layer beneath themegalithic site visible on the surface—yielded a radiocarbon date of 5200 BC(i.e. 7,200 years ago, nearly 3,000 years older than the orthodox dating for thePyramids of Giza in Egypt) and there are firm indications from the originalremote sensing and core drilling work of much older layers below.52[part0125.html#chapter18-52] In short, it is now evident to all that GunungPadang is vastly older than the 3,000 years that archaeologists had insistedupon for decades. Even the most hostile among them, therefore, have begun toreframe their assessment of the site and to refer to it as “a gigantic terracedtomb, which was part of the biggest megalithic culture in the archipelago.”53[part0125.html#chapter18-53]I stayed in touch with Danny during the writing of this book. On 14 January 2015he emailed me to tell me the disappointing news that further fieldwork had notyet been authorized. “We are still waiting for the new government to take actionon the continuity of the national team for Gunung Padang,” he wrote. He wasconcerned, he added, about construction activities that had been undertaken atGunung Padang in the interim “by Public Works, Tourism Department and others …They are conducted without a clear plan/design and consultation with us, so theyare destroying the site.” He remained optimistic, however, that he and his teamwould be allowed to continue with their excavations shortly. If so, he said, “bythe end of 2015 I hope to know more about the second layer (the 7,000-year-oldconstructions) and begin to understand about the third layer (pre-10,000 yearsago).”54 [part0125.html#chapter18-54]On 10 March 2015, I heard from Danny again. Most unfortunately, he could onlyreport that there had been no progress at all since his mail of 14 January:The new Ministry of Culture has not activated the national team yet. We arestill waiting and hoping the new Ministry will have a good attitude towardGunung Padang research.55 [part0125.html#chapter18-55]Time will tell, but the auspices do not look good, and as Magicians of the Godsgoes to press I fear that the dead hand of orthodox archaeology may once againhave prevailed, in what almost appears to be a deliberate strategy to prevent usfrom learning the truth about our past. Below the layers dated to approximately7,000 and 10,000 years ago are the even older strata of man-made constructionsat Gunung Padang. These strata, as yet unexcavated, as yet unexplored,identified only by core-drilling and remote sensing equipment, go back beforethe cataclysmic episode of the Younger Dryas (12,800 years ago to 11,600 yearsago) and deep into the last Ice Age, when the lost civilization stillthrived—the lost civilization that we know only through myths and traditions,and through the works of its survivors as they sought to recreate “the formerworld of the gods.”Indonesia must rank among the most plausible candidates anywhere on earth forthe heartland in which that civilization could have evolved and grown tomaturity. In recognition of this, a number of serious researchers, includingDanny Natawidjaja and Professor Arysio Santos, have presented evidence thatPlato has been misunderstood over the location of Atlantis in the AtlanticOcean.56 [part0125.html#chapter18-56] All the clues, they say, really point eastand place the lost civilization between the Indian and the Pacific Oceans—i.e.on the exact spot once occupied by the flooded Ice Age continent of Sundaland,of which the Indonesian islands are the surviving remnant. Mainstreamarchaeology remains strongly opposed to the notion of any lost civilization byany name, regardless of whether it is said to be located in the west or in theeast. In my opinion, however, there’s already enough ancient “high strangeness”around Indonesia to raise question-marks over such thinking. A few examples:• I’ve already mentioned Homo floresiensis, the “Hobbit,” quite possibly acompletely different human species from our own57 [part0125.html#chapter18-57]that survived for tens of thousands of years after our other evolutionarycousins the Neanderthals and the Denisovans had vanished from the earth. It’sintriguing that the date of extinction of Homo floresiensis appears to have beenaround 12,000 years ago58 [part0125.html#chapter18-58]—exactly in theapocalyptic Younger Dryas window.• In its issue of 8 October 2014, the prestigious academic journal Naturereported, in a tone of astonishment, that elaborate, sophisticated cavepaintings had been found on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi with a minimum ageof 39,900 years, making this art as old, or older, than anything comparable everfound in Europe—previously considered to be the exclusive home of such early,advanced symbolic behavior.59 [part0125.html#chapter18-59]• And it was Nature again, in its issue of 12 February 2015, that reported thediscovery on Java of geometric engravings “generally interpreted as indicativeof modern cognition and behavior” yet dated to half a million years ago—which is300,000 years older than the supposed first appearance of anatomically modernhumans on our planet.60 [part0125.html#chapter18-60]If evidence like this that rewrites the human story has remained undiscovered inIndonesia until so recently, how much else is still to be found and whyshouldn’t the next turn of the archaeologists’ spade reveal a hithertounrecognized civilization? Given the vast loss of terrain suffered across thisentire region as a result of more than 100 meters of sea-level rise at the endof the Ice Age, anything is possible. This is why Gunung Padang is so important.And most important of all, perhaps, is that huge chamber identified byground-penetrating radar and other remote sensing technologies lying deep withinthe pyramid between 70 and 90 feet beneath its apex.Is it the Hall of Records of the lost civilization?Once again, only time will tell …Mountains of fire and ashGunung Padang wasn’t quite the end of our June 2014 research trip. Afterre-exploring that amazing site, absorbing its ancient, mellow, slightlyperplexing atmosphere and understanding again, even more clearly than before,why it is still to this day known as the Mountain of Light by local people wholove and revere it, Santha and I travel back to Bandung, the regional capital.From there the following morning we catch a train for the seven hour journey toYogyakarta in Central Java, where we mean to spend a few days around the fabledBuddhist temple of Borobudur.The train journey is … charming, and the endless vistas it affords of ricefields and mountains and green trees everywhere bursting with life, and thefriendly, busy people, are a delight. It’s nightfall by the time we arrive inYogyakarta, but the next morning we’re up at 4 a.m. to drive to Punthuk Setumbu,a hillside looking down into the valley where Borobudur stands. The air’s notcold—it’s never seriously cold here—but it’s fresh and there’s a wide pool ofdarkness beneath us … expectant darkness, because that’s where Borobudur is andwill soon be lit up by the sun.But the sun rises slowly, light seeping into the sky, gradually illuminating thethickly forested mountainside and the valley below, showing us the distantslopes of the towering twin volcanoes that also overlook Borobudur—Mount Merapi(literally “Fire Mountain”), which is still active, and Mount Merbabu (“Mountainof Ash”), which is dormant. By around 5 a.m. the dense trees that carpet thevalley floor begin to become visible, though shrouded in low-lying cloud, andsoon afterward a breath of wind stirs the mist, giving us our first glimpse ofthe massive, jagged pyramidal form of Borobodur, crowned with a towering stupathat seems to reach for the heavens, a cosmic axis piercing the navel of theearth to connect sky and underworld. As the sun rises higher the mist swirls andexpands, winding and curling among the trees, pooling in the deeper parts of thevalley, but above it all Borobodur stands out clear, like some mythical islandfrom the dawn of time.We’re impatient to visit it after this tantalizing invitation, but we haveanother plan for today and drive east out of Yogyakarta heading first forSurakata City (usually referred to by its residents as Solo) and then onwardfurther east to Mount Lawu, another massive, dormant volcano. The whole of Java,it seems, is straddled by these slumbering giants, whose outpourings in the pasthave blessed the island with essential nutrients, making its soils incrediblyverdant, fertile and productive.We wind our way up Lawu’s precipitous slopes through green glittering teaplantations until at an altitude of 910 meters (2,990 feet), with the peak ofthe volcano still towering more than 2,000 meters above us, we reach the littlehamlet where Danny Natawidjaja has recommended we take a look at Candi Sukuh, arather odd and mysterious little temple. “It seems out of place in Indonesia,”he told us. “It looks more like a Mayan step pyramid.”This, it turns out, is absolutely correct. Sukuh, though smaller, isastonishingly similar in general appearance to the step-pyramid ofKukulkan/Quetzalcoatl at Chichen Itza in the Yucatan. Sukuh was built in thefifteenth century, just before the conversion of Indonesia from Hinduism andBuddhism to Islam. Why it was built, however, or why its style is so distinctiveand unusual for Indonesia, remains a mystery to scholarship. The KukulkanPyramid, in its present incarnation—though it encloses an older structure—isthought to have been built between the ninth and twelfth centuries. Thousands ofmiles and hundreds of years therefore separate the two structures and thelikelihood of any direct influence of one upon the other is slim. As I exploreSukuh, however—and it has a mystical air about it enhanced by a late afternoonmist that wreathes the whole mountainside—I find myself wondering whether thesimilarities are pure accident, or whether they might not be better explained bythe influence in both regions of the same remotely ancient common source.The signalCertainly such an influence is present at Borobudur, a pyramid-temple consistingof 1.6 million blocks of volcanic andesite,61 [part0125.html#chapter18-61]constructed over a period of fifty years from the last quarter of the eighth tothe first quarter of the ninth century AD.62 [part0125.html#chapter18-62] Thereis no dedication inscription, indeed almost no inscriptions of any kind. 63[part0125.html#chapter18-63] This is, however, undoubtedly a Buddhist monument—afact of which one could hardly be in any doubt since its acres of exquisitelybeautiful reliefs are devoted for the most part to stories from the life ofBuddha. Within Buddhist thought it is to be regarded as:a cosmic mountain, a sacred replica of the universe designed to lead the pilgrimto the realization of full enlightenment, sambodhi, by which a Bodhisattvabecomes a Buddha—the ultimate goal of Buddhism … The devotee follows a path tothe top of this mountain, keeping his right shoulder to the monument.Subsequently his path brings him along the … many galleries that show panelswith scenes in stone relief of which the Buddhist character has become clear andwhich have been recognized to represent the ancient Buddhist texts.64[part0125.html#chapter18-64]On this clockwise perambulation of the monument, gradually working your way upfrom earth to sky, you pass 504 life-sized statues of the Buddha, of which 432are found on the square stepped terraces with the remaining 72 on the threecircular terraces at the summit surrounding the great central stupa. Inaddition, calculations of the correct pilgrim route through the four bas-reliefgalleries have shown that the direction of the path:as well as the number of times that each gallery must be walked, is determinedby the bas-reliefs on each side of the gallery walkway. In order to “read” theentire collection in the correct order, worshippers are compelled to complete atotal of ten circuits around the galleries in the clockwise direction. In sodoing, each worshipper passes by a Buddha image an additional 2,160 times beforereaching the summit entranceway …65 [part0125.html#chapter18-65]The reader will realize immediately, as I did when I undertook my ownperambulations of Borobudur, that with these numbers we are back once again inthe mysteriously insistent and universal numerical code described in previouschapters. This code, as we’ve seen, is based on the hard to observe phenomenonof the precession of the equinoxes that unfolds at the rate of one degree every72 years, that sees the equinoctial sun housed in turn by each constellation ofthe zodiac for 2,160 years and that is deployed to make the Great Pyramid ofGiza a model of our planet on a scale of 1 to 43,200.Its presence also at Baalbek, and at Göbekli Tepe, and now here at Borobudur, aswell as in myths and traditions from all around the world, can only be explainedby a remote common influence manifesting in all these places and forms—that“almost unbelievable” ancestor civilization identified by Giorgio de Santillanaand Hertha von Dechend, that “first dared to understand the world as createdaccording to number, weight and measure.”66 [part0125.html#chapter18-66]It’s my intuition, as I’ve suggested at several points throughout this book,that the lost civilization sought to send a signal to the future—indeed to us,today, in the twenty-first century—and that the carrier wave of this signal isthe precessional code.Two different means were used to ensure the signal’s survival through time.First, it was embedded in myths and legends and in mathematical andarchitectural precepts that would be passed on and renewed again and again bythe different cultures that received them, thus boosting the signal and allowingit to remain intact for thousands of years. Even if those through whose handsand minds the signal passed no longer understood its meaning, the weight ofsacred tradition, hoary with age, would ensure that they continued to transmitit and would do their utmost to keep it free from interference.Secondly, the signal was hard-wired into certain megalithic sites. Some werehidden in plain view like the Giza complex, which successive cultures continuedto work on and perfect for thousands of years according to the “divine” canon.Others were buried in the ground—time-capsules like Göbekli Tepe, and perhapslike that mysterious chamber deep beneath Gunung Padang—and primed forrediscovery when the time was right.“There shall be memorials mighty of their handiworks upon the earth,” the SacredSermon of Hermes tells us, “leaving dim trace behind when cycles are renewed.”67[part0125.html#chapter18-67]According to G. R. S. Mead, the pioneer scholar in the field of Gnostic andHermetic Studies, these lines are meant to turn our attention back toward thepast:to a time when a mighty race, devoted to growth in wisdom, lived on earth andleft great monuments of their wisdom in the work of their hands, dim traces ofwhich were to be seen in the “renewal of the times” …68[part0125.html#chapter18-68]Mead finds in this an echo of the ancient conviction “that there were alternateperiods of destruction by fire and water, and of renewal”:69[part0125.html#chapter18-69]In Egypt, the common belief … was that the last destruction had been by waterand flood. Before this Flood … there had been a mighty race of Egyptians, therace of the first Hermes … Some dim traces of the mighty works of this bygone,wisdom loving civilization were still to be seen …70[part0125.html#chapter18-70]And Mead adds, as few modern scholars would dare:I am, myself, strongly inclined to believe this tradition; and I have sometimesspeculated on the possibility of there being buried beneath one or more of thepyramids the remains of some prehistoric buildings that have survived theFlood.71 [part0125.html#chapter18-71]There is more in the Hermetica that touches on this theme, and quitespecifically a reminder of the “Books of Thoth,” of their creation byThoth-Hermes himself, and of their purpose:For what he knew, he graved on stone; yet though he graved them onto stone hehid them mostly, keeping sure silence though in speech, that every youngergeneration of cosmic time might seek for them.72 [part0125.html#chapter18-72]Depositing his books, the wisdom god uttered the following words, admitting inthe process his own “perishability”—and thus, perhaps, that he was no god but amortal human being:Ye Holy Books, which have been written by my perishable hands, but have beenanointed with the drug of imperishability … remain ye unseen and undiscovered byall men who shall go to and fro on the plains of this land, until the time whenHeaven, grown old, shall beget organisms worthy of you …73[part0125.html#chapter18-73]Mead provides no explanation of this strange word “organisms”—sometimes alsotranslated as “instruments”—but in his own edition of the Hermetica, Sir WalterScott does. “After long ages,” he says, it means that “there will be born menthat are worthy to read the books of Hermes.”74 [part0125.html#chapter18-74]Has that time come?Are we worthy, at last, to read those “books” of lost wisdom hidden away beforethe Flood?And, if so, what might they say?"},{"pageContent":" Part VIII [part0131.html#c_part8]Closure [part0131.html#c_part8]"},{"pageContent":" Chapter 19 [part0131.html#c_ch19]The Next Lost Civilization? [part0131.html#c_ch19]More than two thousand flood myths that have come down to us from the remotepast are eerily consistent on many points, and on one in particular: thecataclysm was not a random accident, we are told; we brought it upon ourselvesby our own behavior.Our arrogance and our cruelty toward one another, our noise and strife and thewickedness of our hearts, angered the gods. We ceased to nurture spirit. Weceased to love and tend the earth and no longer regarded the universe withreverent awe and wonder. Dazzled by our own success, we forgot how to carry ourprosperity with moderation.So it was, Plato tells us, with the once generous and good citizens of Atlantis,who in former times possessed “a certain greatness of mind, and treated thevagaries of fortune and one another with wisdom and forbearance,” but who becameswollen with overweening pride in their own achievements and fell into crassmaterialism, greed and violence:To the perceptive eye the depth of their degeneration was clear enough, but tothose whose judgment of true happiness is defective they seemed, in theirpursuit of unbridled ambition and power, to be at the height of their fame andfortune.1 [part0126.html#chapter19-1]If ever a society could be said to meet all the mythological criteria of thenext lost civilization—a society that ticks all the boxes—is it not obvious thatit is our own? Our pollution and neglect of the majestic garden of the earth,our rape of its resources, our abuse of the oceans and the rainforests, ourfear, hatred and suspicion of one another multiplied by a hundred bitterregional and sectarian conflicts, our consistent track record of standing by anddoing nothing while millions suffer, our ignorant, narrow-minded racism, ourexclusivist religions, our forgetfulness that we are all brothers and sisters,our bellicose chauvinism, the dreadful cruelties that we indulge in, in the nameof nation, or faith, or simple greed, our obsessive, competitive, ego-drivenproduction and consumption of material goods and the growing conviction of many,fueled by the triumphs of materialist science, that matter is all there is—thatthere is no such thing as spirit, that we are just accidents of chemistry andbiology—all these things, and many more, in mythological terms at least, do notlook good for us.Meanwhile, we have made ourselves the possessors of a technology so advancedthat it seems almost like magic, even while we use it constantly in our dailylives. Computer science, the internet, aviation, television, telecommunications,space exploration, genetic engineering, nuclear weapons, nanotechnology,transplant surgery … The list goes on and on, yet very few of us are able tounderstand how more than a tiny fraction of it works, and as it proliferates thehuman spirit withers and we engage in “all manner of reckless crimes, wars androbberies and frauds, and all things hostile to the nature of the soul.”2[part0126.html#chapter19-2]Suppose for a moment that a cataclysm besets us, a cataclysm so vast that ourcomplex, networked, highly specialized technological civilizationcollapses—collapses utterly beyond any hope of redemption. If such a scenariowere to unfold it is likely that the meekest and most marginalized of thepeoples who inhabit our world today—the hunter-gatherers of the Amazon jungleand the Kalahari desert, for example, who are used to making do with very littleand whose survival skills are exemplary—would be the very ones most likely tomake it through and therefore carry on the story of humanity in post-cataclysmictimes.How would their descendants remember us a thousand or ten thousand years fromnow? How, for example, might something that we regard as routine, like ourability to receive 24-hour rolling television news and hear sound and viewimages from all parts of the world, and even from outer space, be recollected inmyth and tradition? Might it not be said wonderingly of us, as it was of “theForefathers” recalled in the Popol Vuh, the sacred book of the ancient QuicheMaya:They were endowed with intelligence; they saw and instantly they could see far,they succeeded in seeing, they succeeded in knowing all that there is in theworld. When they looked, instantly they saw all around them, and theycontemplated in turn the arch of heaven and the round face of the earth. Thethings hidden in the distance they saw all without first having to move; at oncethey saw the world, and so, too, from where they were, they saw it. Great wastheir wisdom; their sight reached to the forests, the lakes, the seas, themountains and the valleys.3 [part0126.html#chapter19-3]Yet, in common with so many other memories that seem to hark back to an advancedlost civilization of prehistoric antiquity, we learn that in due course the“Forefathers” became arrogant and proud and overstepped their bounds so that thegods asked: “Must they perchance be the equals of ourselves, their Makers? Letus check a little their desires, because it is not well what we see.”4[part0126.html#chapter19-4] Punishment swiftly followed:The Heart of Heaven blew mist into their eyes, which clouded their sight as whena mirror is breathed on. Their eyes were covered and they could see only whatwas close, only that was clear to them. In this way all the wisdom and all theknowledge of [the Forefathers] were destroyed.5 [part0126.html#chapter19-5]It is interesting to note the mechanisms used by the gods to keep our ancestorsin their place, as described in the Popol Vuh:A flood was brought about by the Heart of Heaven … A heavy resin fell from thesky … The face of the earth was darkened and a black rain began to fall by dayand by night …6 [part0126.html#chapter19-6] The faces of the sun and the moonwere covered …7 [part0126.html#chapter19-7] There was much hail, black rain andmist and indescribable cold …8 [part0126.html#chapter19-8]All these phenomena very accurately reflect the complex nature of the cataclysmthat afflicted the earth 12,800 years ago at the beginning of the Younger Dryascold epoch when, as we saw from the mass of evidence presented in Part II, manyscientists are now certain that the earth was struck by several large fragmentsof a disintegrating giant comet.It is my opinion, indeed it is the reason I have written this book, that we needto pay attention to such accounts, and the universal details that unite them,whether they come down to us from Mexico, from Peru, from Easter Island, fromMesopotamia, from Ancient Egypt, from ancient Canaan or from Turkey. It isintriguing, for example, against the background of flood and cataclysm itdescribes, that the Popol Vuh makes mention of “fish-men,”9[part0126.html#chapter19-9] exactly like the Apkallu Sages of Mesopotamia (“whohad the whole body of a fish, but underneath and attached to the head of thefish there was another head, human, and joined to the tail of the fish, feetlike those of a man”).10 [part0126.html#chapter19-10] Exactly like the Apkallu,too, these fish men reported in the traditions of the ancient Maya possessedmagical powers and “worked many miracles.”11 [part0126.html#chapter19-11]It is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that Quetzalcoatl, the FeatheredSerpent, the civilization bringer who appears in the Popol Vuh under the name ofGucumatz,12 [part0126.html#chapter19-12] should be represented, as we saw inChapter One, by an ancient image from La Venta on the Gulf of Mexico in which heholds the exact same sort of bag or bucket that the Apkallu hold in theMesopotamian reliefs and that is also figured on Pillar 43 at Göbekli Tepe inTurkey. La Venta was one of the centers of the mysterious early civilization ofthe Olmecs, who left behind sculptures of bearded men with features that do notlook at all like those of native Americans, but resemble the bearded figuresshown in the Mesopotamian Apkallu reliefs and in the statues of Kon-TikiViracocha at Tiahuanaco in Bolivia—again hinting at universal symbolismassociated with a group of individuals who sought to disseminate the gifts ofcivilization all around the world. Moreover, it is widely recognized that theextraordinary astronomical science for which the Maya are famed was part of awider body of advanced knowledge that had been passed down to them by the Olmecsand that the Mayan calendar itself is probably best understood as one of theseOlmec legacies.As we saw in Chapter Fifteen, a great cycle of the Mayan calendar came to an endon 21 December 2012. It is an end date that was calculated to mark theonce-in-26,000-year conjunction of the winter solstice sun and the center of theMilky Way galaxy—a conjunction that is itself, because of the diameter of thesun and the limitations of naked-eye astronomy, not so much a precise moment intime as a window 80 years wide spanning the period 1960–2040. We saw, too, howPillar 43 at Göbekli Tepe uses solar and constellation symbolism to depict theexact same window through which, as any astronomical software program willconfirm, the winter solstice sun is still transiting today.My intuition is that these devices, both the Mayan calendar and the Göbekli Tepepillar, are an attempt, using the precessional code, to send a message to thefuture. I see the lineaments of that message also in the huge astronomicalgeoglyph formed by the Pyramids and the Great Sphinx of Giza. Using the samecode, and their relationship to the constellations of Orion and Leo, thesemonuments draw our attention to the epoch of the Younger Dryas between 12,800and 11,600 years ago and, through the symbolism of the return of the Phoenix, tothe epoch that falls half a precessional cycle later, i.e. once again our ownepoch (see Chapter Eleven).The targeting here is not so precise as that afforded by the Göbekli Tepe pillarand the Mayan calendar, but then neither is the science by which the impactsthat set off the Younger Dryas are dated to 12,800 years ago. The resolution ofthe carbon-14 evidence upon which scientists base this chronology means that atolerance of plus or minus 150 years must be allowed. In other words, theYounger Dryas comet—let us, for convenience, refer to it as “the Phoenix”—couldhave struck the earth as late as 12,650 years ago (i.e. in 10,635 BC, since I amwriting in AD 2015) or as early as 12,950 years ago (i.e. in 10,935 BC).Bearing in mind that half a precessional cycle is 12,960 years (or 12,954 yearsin the peculiarly exact calculations of the return of the Phoenix reported bySolinus13 [part0126.html#chapter19-13]), we are therefore being invited toconsider a period that begins in just ten years from the time of writing, i.e.around AD 2025, and that cannot be considered to have passed safely until AD2325—i.e. until the full 12,960 years have elapsed after the latest possibledate for “the Phoenix” impacts. The Mayan calendar and Pillar 43 at GöbekliTepe, however, refine the calculation, as we’ve seen. If I understand themessage correctly, we’re in the danger zone now and will be until 2040. I’mreminded of the Ojibwa tradition cited in Chapter Three:The star with the long, wide tail is going to destroy the world some day when itcomes low again. That’s the comet called Long-Tailed Heavenly Climbing Star. Itcame down here once, thousands of years ago. Just like the sun. It had radiationand burning heat in its tail.The comet burned everything to the ground. There wasn’t a thing left. Indianpeople were here before that happened, living on the earth. But things werewrong; a lot of people had abandoned the spiritual path. The holy spirit warnedthem a long time before the comet came. Medicine men told everyone to prepare.Things were wrong with nature on the earth … Then that comet went through here.It had a long, wide tail and it burned up everything. It flew so low the tailscorched the earth … The comet made a different world. After that survival washard work. The weather was colder than before …14 [part0126.html#chapter19-14]Does it sound like scaremongering to suggest that the comet remembered in this,and in so many other myths and traditions from all parts of the globe, might beabout to stage its “Great Return”?Am I reading too much into recondite ancient monuments and calendars and intothe fact that everywhere, universally, across all cultures, comets have alwaysbeen regarded with fear and loathing and as omens of impending doom anddestruction?15 [part0126.html#chapter19-15]I’m not sure what the right answer to these questions is. From a personal pointof view, as a loving father and grandfather, I would greatly prefer it if therewas no such danger, yet at the same time, if there is danger, we would befoolish to bury our heads in the sand and pretend that there’s nothing to worryabout and no action we need to take. I’m therefore obliged to point out that themost recent science on this subject is in complete agreement with the ancientwisdom.There is danger.The house of history is built on sandWe are in the midst of a profound paradigm shift regarding how we view theevolution of human civilization. As noted at the end of Chapter Five,archaeologists have been in the habit of regarding cosmic impacts, supposedlyonly occurring at multi-million year intervals, as largely irrelevant to the200,000-year story of anatomically modern humans. When we believed that the lastbig impact had been the dinosaur-killing asteroid of 65 million years ago, therewas obviously little point in trying to relate cosmic accidents on such analmost unimaginable scale in any way to the much shorter time-frame of“history.” But the nightmare scenario raised by the group of scientists behindthe Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, and supported by the mass of compellingevidence reviewed in Part II—namely that a huge, earthshaking, extinction-levelevent occurred just 12,800 years ago, in our historical backyard—changeseverything …First and foremost, it means the historical timeline taught as “fact” in all ourschools and institutions of higher learning, the slow painful steps fromPalaeolithic to Neolithic, the development of agriculture, the rise of the firstcities, and so on and so forth—in short, all the conclusions archaeology hascome to about the origins of civilization—rest on false foundations. For by whatword other than “false” can the underpinnings of the existing historicalparadigm be described, when we now know that they were put in place withouttaking account of the single biggest cataclysm to hit the earth since theextinction of the dinosaurs? This cataclysm, moreover, unfolded in a veryspecific and very recent period, the Younger Dryas between 12,800 and 11,600years ago, and was immediately followed by the first signs of the emergence ofcivilization at Göbekli Tepe in Turkey, and soon afterward at many other pointsaround the globe.To recognize, as archaeologists now do, that these early experiments incivilized living all took place right after the Younger Dryas “punctuationmark,” yet to take no account of the massive worldwide trauma and destructionunleashed by the cosmic impacts that caused the Younger Dryas, is a real lapseof scholarship. What is worse, however, is the parallel failure to devote even amoment’s consideration to the possibility that crucial chapters of the humanstory—perhaps even a great civilization of prehistoric antiquity—might have beenerased from the historical record by those impacts and by the floods, the blackbituminous rain, the time of darkness and the indescribable cold that followed.If our own civilization were to pass through a comparable cascade of giantimpacts would we survive?All the indications are that we would not and this is why, in my view, thegrowing recognition of the reality of the Younger Dryas comet lays a duty uponarchaeologists to desist—at the very least—from pouring further scorn upon“Atlantis,” and other rumors of a lost Ice Age civilization that have come downto us from the past. Rather than doing everything in their power to dismiss,minimize and ridicule the myths, the anomalous monuments, and the othertantalizing hints, traces and clues of a great forgotten episode of humanhistory, the evidence of the comet impacts 12,800 years ago requires that athorough investigation of these mysteries, drawing on the full resources ofscience, should be undertaken for the first time.Agenda?Great resistance will have to be overcome before such an investigation can bemounted—and for the same reasons that James Kennett, Allen West, RichardFirestone and the other leading researchers of the Younger Dryas impacts havefaced resistance from their gradualist, “uniformitarian” colleagues. As Kennetthas observed, the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis challenges existing paradigmsacross a broad range of disciplines—not just archaeology, but also paleontology,paleoceanography, paleoclimatology and impact dynamics.16[part0126.html#chapter19-16]Inevitably when one presents new evidence that treads on so many different toes,there is going to be opposition. Academic turf wars, however, are one thing;keeping us all in the dark about a real and present danger that threatens thehuman future, simply because recognizing the existence of that danger requiressome scholars to abandon long-cherished positions, is quite another.Yet this is precisely what seems to be involved in the ideological attacks,masquerading as genuine criticism, that have been made on the work of Kennett,West, Firestone and others—attacks, as we saw in Part II, that they haverepeatedly and amply refuted, but that can be expected to continue so long asmyopic territorialism prevails in science over the rational appraisal ofdisturbing and, in the case of the Younger Dryas comet, utterly convincing newevidence.And there may be more to this than just an academic turf war—indeed somethingthat much more closely resembles a conspiracy to hide unpalatable truths. As Iwas researching Magicians of the Gods, I exchanged a number of emails with AllenWest, since I wanted to check facts and he’s the team member listed as thecorresponding author on most of the academic papers about the Younger Dryasimpact. Our discussions became quite wide-ranging and at one point he wrote:I think your new book will open up the comet hypothesis to a much largeraudience and that is very good for our planet, because this impact topic is notjust interesting past history. The Younger Dryas impact was devastating, butmuch smaller ones could devastate a city, region, or country today, and they aremuch more frequent than publicly admitted by NASA and the ESA [European SpaceAgency], though there seems to be growing awareness.17[part0126.html#chapter19-17]Picking up on this issue of the apparently deliberate suppression of informationabout impacts, and about the Younger Dryas impacts in particular, I emailed Westas follows:Having seen the shoddy way catastrophist ideas have been treated again and againdown the years, I suppose I should not be surprised by the concerted hostilityof your critics, how they spin things, and their constant crowing about thelatest “requiem” for the comet theory—which turns out to be not a requiem at allbut just propaganda basically! But still, I can’t help feeling there issomething odd about the way your critics seem almost deliberately to ignorecrucial evidence that you have presented in order to generate headlines like“study casts doubt on mammoth-killing impact” or to say things like “for theSyria site the impact theory is out,” when it isn’t “out” at all!Is it just that they desperately want the world to be a safe, predictable placeand seek to fulfill their own wish by fudging the facts in their papers? Or isthere some other agenda at work?18 [part0126.html#chapter19-18]West’s reply was intriguing:That certainly is one aspect. One critic complained to me that “Well, if you areright, we will have to rewrite the textbooks!” As if that were a bad thing …[But], curiously, some of our most virulent critics are associated with NASA andthe government. A NASA employee tells me that this attitude of opposition toimpact threats is entrenched in NASA and is only now slowly beginning to change.When it became obvious to NASA decades ago that asteroids and comets are aserious threat, their employees were instructed by top government officials todownplay the risk. The government was concerned that the populace would “panic”over space rocks and demand action, when NASA couldn’t do anything about themand didn’t want to admit it. Plus, trying to mitigate any impact hazards wouldhave used up funding they wanted to put elsewhere.19[part0126.html#chapter19-19]The dark travelerAs long ago as 1990, before any of the physical, geological evidence for theYounger Dryas comet impacts had been discovered, astrophysicist Victor Clube andastronomer Bill Napier warned of the view:that treats the cosmos as a harmless backdrop to human affairs, a view whichAcademe now often regards as its business to uphold and to which Church andState are only too glad to subscribe.20 [part0126.html#chapter19-20]Such a view, in Clube and Napier’s prescient 1990 opinion, was dangerous in thatits effect was to “place the human species a little higher than the ostrich,awaiting the fate of the dinosaur.”21 [part0126.html#chapter19-21]As can be seen from the reactions of some members of “Academe” to the YoungerDryas impact hypothesis, this view, and what Clube and Napier call the “greatillusion of cosmic security”22 [part0126.html#chapter19-22] that it engenders,are still powerful forces in the world today. Much more than the truth about ourown past is at stake, however, for there is a chilling convergence between Clubeand Napier’s findings on the one hand, and the findings of Kennett, West andFirestone on the other, as to what the Younger Dryas comet really means forhumanity.To understand the implications of this convergence properly it will be necessaryto review some of the discoveries made by Clube, Napier and others in the 1980sand 1990s—discoveries, remember, that are completely independent of the laterwork of the Kennett/West/Firestone team on the Younger Dryas impacts. To cut along story short, as I’ve already indicated in Chapter Eleven, the burden ofthese discoveries is that it is possible—indeed highly probable—that we are notyet done with the comet that changed the face of the earth between 12,800 yearsago and 11,600 years ago. Clube and Napier’s work, with important contributionsalso from the late Sir Fred Hoyle, and from mathematician and astronomerProfessor Chandra Wickramasinghe, has raised the chilling possibility that theYounger Dryas comet was itself only a fragment of a much larger, giantcomet—once perhaps as much as 100 kilometers in diameter—which entered the innersolar system about 30,000 years ago and was captured by the sun and flung intoan earth-crossing orbit. It remained relatively intact for the next 10,000years. Then around 20,000 years ago it underwent a massive “fragmentation event”somewhere along its orbit that transformed it from a single deadly andpotentially world-killing object into multiple objects grading down from 5kilometers to 1 kilometer or less in diameter, each and every one of which wouldstill, in its own right, be capable of causing a global cataclysm.23[part0126.html#chapter19-23]The evidence is that it was several fragments on this scale that hit the earth12,800 years ago, causing the Younger Dryas,24 [part0126.html#chapter19-24] thatwe crossed the debris stream of the comet again 11,600 years ago with equallydramatic effects that ended the Younger Dryas,25 [part0126.html#chapter19-25]and—finally—that we can expect further encounters with the remaining fragmentsin the future.26 [part0126.html#chapter19-26] “This unique complex of debris,”write Clube and Napier, “is undoubtedly the greatest collision hazard facing theearth at the present time.”27 [part0126.html#chapter19-27]The Taurid meteor stream, so called because it produces showers of “shootingstars” that look to observers on the ground as though they originate in theconstellation of Taurus, is the most familiar and best-known product of theongoing fragmentation of the original giant comet. The stream sprawls completelyacross the earth’s orbit—a distance of more than 300 million kilometers—cuttingit in two places so that the planet must pass through it twice a year: in lateJune and early July (when the “shooting stars” are not visible because they areencountered in daylight) and again from late October into November when aspectacular “Halloween firework” display is put on.28[part0126.html#chapter19-28] Since the earth travels more than 2.5 millionkilometers along its orbital path every day, and since each passage takesapproximately twelve days, it is obvious that the Taurid stream is at least 30million kilometers “wide” or “thick.” Indeed, what the earth encounters duringthese two periods is best envisaged as a sort of “tube” or “pipe” of fragmenteddebris—a bit like a huge doughnut. The geometrical term for such a shape is a“torus.”“Shooting stars” are harmless—nothing more than tiny meteors burning up in theatmosphere—so why should we be in the least bit concerned about a meteor stream?In the case of the fifty or so distinct and separate meteor streams that havenow been discovered by astronomers—the Leonids, the Perseids, the Andromedids,etc—the answer to this question is that in most cases there is probably nodanger and nothing to fear. Since most of the particles that they contain areindeed tiny, they represent no threat to the earth.But it is quite a different matter with the Taurids. As Clube, Napier, Hoyle andWickramasinghe have demonstrated, the Taurid stream is filled to overflowingwith other much more massive material, sometimes visible, sometimes shrouded inclouds of dust, and all of it flying through space at tremendous velocities andintersecting the earth’s orbit twice a year, regular as clockwork, year in yearout. Among the massive, deadly members of the Taurid family are Comet Encke,which is estimated to have a diameter of around 5 kilometers. But Comet Encke isnot alone. According to Clube and Napier there are also:between one and two hundred asteroids of more than a kilometer diameter orbitingwithin the Taurid meteor stream. It seems clear that we are looking at thedebris from the breakup of an extremely large object. The disintegration, orsequence of disintegrations, must have taken place within the last twenty orthirty thousand years, as otherwise the asteroids would have spread around theinner planetary system and be no longer recognizable as a stream.29[part0126.html#chapter19-29]In addition to Comet Encke, there are at least two other comets in thestream—Rudnicki, also thought to be about five kilometers in diameter, and amysterious object named Oljiato, which has a diameter of about 1.5 kilometers.30[part0126.html#chapter19-30] Initially believed to be an asteroid, thisextremely dark, earth-crossing projectile sometimes shows signs, visible in thetelescope, of volatility and outgassing and most astronomers now regard it as aninert comet that is in the process of waking up.31 [part0126.html#chapter19-31]Comet Encke itself is known to have been inert for a long period, until itsuddenly flared into life and was first seen by astronomers in 1876.32[part0126.html#chapter19-32] It is now understood to alternate regularly, inextended cycles, between its inert and volatile states.Clube and Napier’s research had convinced them that an as yet undetectedcompanion to Comet Encke is orbiting at the very heart of the Taurid meteorstream.33 [part0126.html#chapter19-33] They believe that this object is ofexceptional size, that it is a comet, and that like Encke and Oljiato itsometimes—for very long periods—shuts itself down. This happens when pitch-liketars that seethe up continuously from its interior during episodes of outgassingbecome so copious that they coat the entire outer surface of the nucleus in athick, hardening shell and seal it off completely—perhaps for millennia.34[part0126.html#chapter19-34] On the outside all falls silent after theincandescent “coma” and tail have faded away and the seemingly inert objecttears silently through space at a speed of tens of kilometers per second. But,at the center of the nucleus, activity continues, gradually building uppressure. Like an overheated boiler with no release valve, the comet eventuallyexplodes from within, breaking up into fragments that can become individualcomets, every one of which threatens the earth.Calculations indicate that this presently invisible object at the heart of theTaurid stream might be as much as 30 kilometers in diameter.35[part0126.html#chapter19-35] Moreover, it is thought likely that other largefragments accompany it. According to Professor Emilio Spedicato of theUniversity of Bergamo:Tentative orbital parameters which could lead to its observation are estimated.It is predicted that in the near future (around the year 2030) the earth willcross again that part of the torus that contains the fragments, an encounterthat in the past has dramatically affected mankind.36[part0126.html#chapter19-36]RebirthThe year 2030 is, of course, exactly in the window of danger indicated by theMayan calendar and Pillar 43 at Göbekli Tepe. The dinosaur-killing asteroid 65million years ago was only 10 kilometers in diameter, yet it set off a globalfirestorm and changed the world forever. A collision with an object 30kilometers in diameter would—at the very least—mean the end of civilization aswe know it, and perhaps even the end of all human life on this planet. Itsconsequences, as noted in Chapter Eleven, would certainly be orders of magnitudegreater than the Younger Dryas impacts 12,800 years ago that had a thousandtimes the combined explosive power of all the nuclear devices stockpiled in theworld today and that left us as a species with amnesia, obliged to begin againlike children with no memory of what went before.However, it doesn’t have to be like that. First and foremost, the universe mightspare us. Imagine crossing that torus is a bit like crossing a six-lane freeway,on foot, wearing a blindfold. Luckily for you, however, there’s not much heavytraffic on the road, so though you have to cross the freeway twice a year youusually don’t bump into much. What makes some crossings more risky than others,however, is the fact that the big trucks and other heavy traffic do have atendency to cluster and bunch in places. Effectively what Clube and Napier havedone with their calculations, backtracking the orbits of known objects in theTaurid “freeway,” is to issue a warning that now and for the coming decades, ourcrossings carry a greatly enhanced risk of a series of collisions with some verymenacing “heavy traffic.”The evidence that just such a series of collisions occurred between 12,800 yearsago and 11,600 years ago and that fragmentation of the progenitor giant cometthat gave rise to all the Taurid objects was the cause, should, at the veryleast, focus our minds. No longer are we dealing with something that onlyhappens at intervals of multiple millions of years, but rather with what appearsto be a cataclysmic process that is still unfolding within the framework ofhistorical time.Even so, we need not give up hope, nor waste a single moment of our preciouslives embracing gloom and doom. While I am convinced a civilization flourishedduring the Ice Age and had mastered advanced sciences that seemed like magic tomore primitive cultures, I do not believe that it followed our own particularpath of technological development. That path has many negative consequences, butit equips us with abilities that the lost civilization clearly lacked—inparticular, the ability to intervene in our immediate cosmic environment and todeflect or destroy asteroids and comets that threaten the very survival ofhumanity.What it will take is the recognition that we are, after all, one species, onepeople, one family, and that rather than waste our energies on murderous feudsin the name of “God,” or “country,” or political ideology, or selfish greed, thetime has come for love and harmony to displace fear and turmoil in every aspectof our lives, so that that we can secure the human future. If we are to do this,we will have to stop seeking out our own reflections in the mirror and learn tolook up into the cosmos instead, we will have to banish hatred and suspicion andlearn to pool our resources, our intelligence and our talents in a grand effortfor the redemption of mankind.We will, in short, have to awaken to the full mystery of the magnificent gift ofconsciousness and realize we must not squander it an instant longer.For this, too, was the promise of the Mayan calendar—that we who are alive todaywill find ourselves at the threshold of a new age of human consciousness. If wecan bring that age to birth, with all it implies, then preventing the remainingfragments of the Younger Dryas comet from devastating the earth will be child’splay and in the process we will have discovered, perhaps for the first time inmore than 12,000 years, who we really are.It is our choice.It always has been.Nothing stands in our way but ourselves."},{"pageContent":"image [../images/00076.jpeg]1.

The lowest star is represented by the Great Pyramid, the middle star bythe Pyramid of Khafre (second pyramid) and the highest star is represented bythe Pyramid of Menkaure (the third and smallest of the pyramids, just as thehighest star is visually the smallest—least bright—of the three stars).Now, the Great Pyramid on the ground is the northernmost of the three, thesecond pyramid is in the middle, of course, and the third pyramid is thesouthernmost of the three. The objection of astronomers such as Ed Krupp of theGriffiths Observatory in Los Angeles is based on their modern convention thatthe sky is a curved dome overhead. If you view the sky that way then the higheststar—which is represented by Menkaure’s Pyramid, according to the Orioncorrelation—is in fact the northernmost star (remember we are looking south, thesky is imagined to be curving overhead—so the higher you go, the closer you getto the north pole of the sky which is behind the painter in the diagram), andthe lowest star, which is represented by the Great Pyramid, according to theOrion correlation, is in fact the southernmost star. But on the ground, theGreat Pyramid is the northernmost pyramid and the Pyramid of Menkaure is thesouthernmost pyramid. Hence Dr. Krupp argues that the correlation is “upsidedown.”What the diagram demonstrates is that this is only correct according to theastronomical convention of the sky being the inside of a sphere that curvesoverhead. If we look at it simply as an artistic project—make a painting of thethree stars of Orion’s belt and then lay that painting down in the most naturalway on the ground in front of us—we will find that it does match/correlateexactly with the positions of the three pyramids on the ground."},{"pageContent":" References [part0131.html#c_ref]Please note that some of the links referenced in this work may no longer beactive.Chapter 1 1 [part0007.html#cha-1]. “The Turkish word Göbek means navel or belly.” KlausSchmidt, Göbekli Tepe, A Stone-Age Sanctuary in South-Eastern Anatolia, ExOriente, Berlin, 2012, p. 88.

In the same emailWest notes that there is one point to add about the dating that is already inprint (at 18 March 2015): “In the YDB layer, we have found high-temperatureproxies, including nanodiamonds, one of a group of proxies that are found in allimpact events. The evidence is widespread—our YDB sites extend across more thana dozen countries on four continents (N. America, S. America, Europe, and Asia).In two papers, Wittke et al and Kinzie et al reported about a dozenhigh-resolution radiocarbon dates, averaging 12,800 ± 100 calendar years ago forthe YDB layer. This means that, statistically, the YDB layer at all those sitescould have been deposited on the same day—it doesn’t prove it did, but shows itis possible. Yet, even though those dates were directly on the YDB layer and arestatistically identical, Meltzer et al rejected them as not being the same. Sucha rejection is simply indefensible.”59 [part0012.html#cha-59]. Charles R. Kinzie et al, “Nanodiamond-Rich Layeracross Three Continents,” op. cit., p. 501.60 [part0012.html#cha-60].

The late Professor Cesar Emiliani of MiamiUniversity, a winner of the Vega Medal from Sweden and the Agassiz medal fromthe National Academy of Sciences of the United States, whose studies focusedextensively on sea level rise, did put a figure on it: “As a result of the floodthat formed the Scabland, the sea level rose very rapidly from minus 100 metersto minus 80 meters. By 12,000 years ago more than fifty percent of the ice hadreturned to the ocean, and the sea level had risen to minus 60 meters.” Thereferences to minus 100 meters, minus 80 meters and minus 60 meters are bycomparison with today’s sea level. So, before the flood that formed the Scablandof the Columbia Plateau, sea level was 100 meters lower than it is today, afterthe flood it was 60 meters lower than it is today, i.e. a staggering rise of 40meters or 131 feet.

Reymond (The Mythical Origin of the Egyptian Temple,op. cit., p. 263) eventually opts for Saqqara as her favored candidate for “theplace to the north of Memphis” where the book was believed to have descendedfrom the sky. Her logic escapes me. Henen-nesut stands at latitude 29:08,Memphis at latitude 29:84, Saqqara at latitude 29:87, the Great Pyramid of Gizaat latitude 29:98, and Dhashur at latitude 29:80. Since the higher the numberthe further north you are, it is obvious we must rule Henen-nesut and Dhashurout: the former is located 0:76 of a degree south of Memphis and the latter islocated 0:04 of a degree south of Memphis. Saqqara is north of Memphis but byjust 0:03 of a degree—so close as to be on almost exactly the same latitude. Bycontrast Giza is 0:14 of a degree north of Memphis and much more obviously fitsthe bill.41 [part0019.html#cha-41]. E.A.

While not asmassive as the Trilithon stones these base structures each have a considerablemass. However below them was discovered a part of a drum to a column. The sizeof the drum corresponds to the columns used for the Jupiter temple, so this waslikely a leftover or no longer useful piece of one of those columns. Because itis underneath the base stones, this drum must have been placed there before theTrilithon was put into place. Also, on top of one of the Trilithon stones thereis a drawing of the plans for the Temple of Jupiter, which was built over by theRomans when it was no longer needed. By having pieces of the Jupiter templebelow the Trilithon and these drawings on top we can be reasonably certain thatthe Trilithon stones were put into place contemporaneously with the constructionof the Temple of Jupiter. So already, by having the Trilithon stonescontemporaneous with the temple we have established the Roman provenance of thestructure.”14 [part0023.html#cha-14]. Michael Alouf refers to this exact section of wall inhis History of Baalbek, op. cit., originally published in July 1890, andreprinted multiple times until 1951. On p. 98 where he describes the Trilithon(“No description will give an exact idea of the bewildering and stupefyingeffect of these tremendous blocks on the spectator”) and then notes: “Abovethese blocks are the Arab fortifications built, as has already been said, ofbases of columns, sculptured friezes and fallen fragments, still bearing aninscription dating to the time of Bahram Shah.”15 [part0023.html#cha-15].

The moon’s orbital plane is inclined to the eclipticplane by only about 5.1 degrees.

The description ofEnoch as “the seventh from Adam” is found in Jude 1:14. And see Genesis 5: 1–32,“The Book of the Generations of Adam.” The ten patriarchs listed are Adam, Seth,Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, Methusaleh, Lamech, Noah(https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+5&version=KJV[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+5&version=KJV]). There isfrequently confusion between Enos, the third patriarch, and Enoch the seventhpatriarch. However no special intelligence, skills or qualities are attributedto Enos whereas, by contrast, Enoch “walked with God” (Genesis 5: 24) andmysteriously vanished from the Earth “for God took him” (Genesis 5: 24). TheBook of Hebrews elaborates (Hebrews 11: 5): “By faith Enoch was taken away sothat he did not see death, ‘and was not found, because God had taken him’; forbefore he was taken he had this testimony, that he pleased God.”20 [part0027.html#cha-20].

It is notable in later chapters of the Book of Enoch,after the bad Watchers have been admonished and received their punishment, thatthe good Watchers reveal to Enoch a great many of the secrets, notablyastronomical lore, that the bad Watchers were condemned for revealing. See, forexample, R.H. Charles (Trans.), The Book of Enoch, op. cit., Chapter 41, p.60ff, Chapter 71, p. 93ff, Chapter 72, p. 95ff, etc. Perhaps it is because hecomes into possession of this restricted knowledge himself that Enoch ultimatelyvanishes from the earth—“taken away by God” as the Bible has it in Genesis 5:24.51 [part0027.html#cha-51].

Genesis 6: 5–8, New International Version. The KingJames Version reads as follows: “And God saw that the wickedness of man wasgreat in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart wasonly evil continually. And it repented the Lord that he had made man on theearth, and it grieved him at his heart. And the Lord said, I will destroy manwhom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and thecreeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have madethem.

To be fair, Sitchin is not alone in making thismistake. A number of genuine Biblical scholars make it also. Writing in TheJewish Quarterly Review in 1985, for example, Jonas C. Greenfield describes theNephilim as “fallen angels” (Jonas C. Greenfield, “The Seven Pillars of Wisdom,”The Jewish Quarterly Review, New Series, Vol. 26, No. 1, p. 19). Likewise in apaper in the Journal of Biblical Literature published in 1987, Ronald S. Hendeltells us: “Nephilim literally means ‘the fallen ones’ … It is a … passiveadjectival formation of the root npl (‘to fall’) … Similar uses of the verbnapal and its derivatives are found elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible” (Ronald S.Hendel, “Of Demigods and the Deluge: Toward an Interpretation of Genesis 6:1–4,” Journal of Biblical Literature, Vol. 106, No. 1, March 1987, p. 22).66 [part0027.html#cha-66]. http://www.sitchiniswrong.com/nephilim/nephilim.htm[http://www.sitchiniswrong.com/nephilim/nephilim.htm].67 [part0027.html#cha-67].
