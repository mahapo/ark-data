Jonathan Talat Phillips’Electric Jesus raises a proud flag for the post-modern Burning Man and technopsychonautic era. However, Phillips also seeks for more than just a flashyescape hatch from the burdens of a materialistic or pop-cultural corporateworldview. The Electric Jesus is about the quest for true Gnosis as much as itis about the crazy costumes we wear along the way. This book is sure to be oneof those that defines the psychedelic resurgence that has been recentlyconstellated by Reality Sandwich and the Evolver Social Movement.”—Adam Elenbaas, author of Fishers of Men: The Gospel of an Ayahuasca VisionQuest“Entertaining, celebratory, burning, reflective, and electric—but definitely notfor the faint of heart or hard of head. With tales of sex, drugs, elves, andJesus, this memoir romps through the hinterlands of body and soul.”—Sharon Gannon, co-founder of Jivamukti Yoga and co-author of The Art of Yoga“Jonathan Talat Phillips discovers Gnosis, transforms himself, goes off the deepend, and somehow stays grounded in the material world.

Or are we going to break free and embrace the next stage of ourevolution?There can be no certainty as to the outcome. Evolution may seem unstoppable, butthe status quo we are struggling to evolve from is supported and defended bysuch huge political and ideological forces, and by such vast institutionalinertia, that it is by no means certain we will be allowed to move on.Nevertheless, who can doubt that a new kind of humanity is beginning to emergein the twenty-first century?These new humans recoil from the growing power and intrusion of the large,centralized State into their lives and believe they are capable of finding newways to cooperate with others that don’t depend on State supervision,regulation, or taxation.These new humans do not feel any special allegiance to the “nation” or “country”they happen to have been born in—and thus do not automatically feel closer andmore connected to a fellow human being if he or she happens to have been born inthe same country. Their primary identification is not with their national genepool but with others of like mind, wherever they find them in the world. Itfollows that the new humans are acutely aware of the absurdity of war and of theartificial and constructed nature of the fear, hatred, and suspicion used byStates to justify wars of all kinds.These new humans see the sterility of politics and economics, where the choicecurrently seems to be between some form of free-market capitalism and some formof socialism. From the new human’s point of view, both systems are essentiallythe same, being rooted and grounded in materialism and in the unprovenassumption that reality is confined to the realm of matter. Socialists andcapitalists argue about how the spoils of that realm should be divided, and whoshould do the dividing, but both are so focused on the primacy of matter thatthey ignore any possible spiritual dimension entirely, even scoffing at the veryconcept.Of course, the spiritual dimension is supposed to be the province ofreligion—isn’t it?Not for the new human, who feels alienated from orthodox religion and does notaccept that the priest, the rabbi, or the mullah should be the exclusiveintermediary between us and the divine. The new human hungers for direct,personal spiritual experience and is willing to go to great lengths, usingancient techniques of ecstasy devised by the shamans and yogis of prehistory, toseek it out. Such techniques, which amount to an archaic spiritual technology,include meditation, dance, controlled breathing, the practise of austerities,and the ingestion of traditional visionary substances such as psilocybinmushrooms or ayahuasca (as well as their more modern synthetic analogues, suchas DMT and LSD).In The Electric Jesus, Jonathan Talat Phillips takes us with him on his ownjourney through the late years of the twentieth century and the birthing yearsof the twenty-first, seeking, like so many of us, to find meaning and purpose inlife. In the end—though he wouldn’t himself claim to be one of the newhumans—his story speaks to the phenomenon of an emergent new humanity in aparticularly eloquent and comprehensive way.As his journey unfolds, he learns to see the glowing energy fields that surroundand are perhaps the essence of every human being, and uses hallucinogens toexplore the hidden meaning of halos and the Tree of Life before telling us ofhis encounter with Gnosticism that lies at the heart of this book.As Jonathan rightly observes, the Judaeo-Christian tradition has supplied “theunderlying operating platform for our civilization—our languages, laws, mores,work ethic, sexuality, even our way of perceiving time (with the Gregoriancalendar)—shaping our worldview, whether we realized it or not.”Yet we do not have an honest relationship with this tradition, because down theages we have not been told the truth about it. An entire strand of earlymystical Christianity known as Gnosticism, which sought direct revealedknowledge of the divine, has simply been edited out of the story by thedominant, “literalist,” hierarchical faction that became the Roman CatholicChurch. Yet there is much evidence—not least the recovery since 1945 of anentire library of hitherto lost Gnostic texts—to suggest that it was thesuppressed strand, not its oppressor, that truly represented the ideas of thefirst Christians.Gnostic mystery schools sought to create Pneumatics—people filled to the brimwith spiritual energy—and this seems to have been brought about by powerful andlife-transforming experiences of altered states of consciousness. There is avery high probability indeed that Gnostic circles in the early centuries of theChristian era were using psychedelic mushrooms as a spiritual technology toaccess the divine. The Gnostics themselves, as Jonathan notes, believed thatliteralist Christians who had not undergone these experiences “were ‘dry canals’bereft of consciousness-expanding pneuma, yet arrogantly claimed to be the solegatekeepers of heaven.” Yet, by unleashing ruthless campaigns of oppressionagainst the Gnostics and putting thousands to death, the literalist factionprevailed and has been wounding and misleading people ever since—robbing them,as Jonathan sees it, of “their own divine spark.”Naturally, Gnosticism has an explanation for why the literalist faction wouldwish to do that. To cut a long story very short indeed, the entity called Yahwehor Jehovah, who is worshipped as the one God in the Judaeo-Christian tradition,is seen in quite a different light by the Gnostics. To them, he is nothing morethan an evil demiurge, a low-class sub-deity, a sort of devil in disguise, whohas created the earth as his personal fief, placed the human race upon it toworship and adore him, and deluded the poor creatures into believing he isactually “God.” His sole purpose for us is to keep us enchained in spiritualignorance and darkness for all eternity. In this he is served by the literalistfaction of the Church.Broadly, what the Gnostics are proposing is that true, original, mysticalChristianity was sent down as an agent of liberation for mankind—to free us fromthe spell of the demiurge. The literalist faction then staged a coup, took overthe institutions and network of the mystical Christians, and turned them againstthemselves by making them serve not God but the demiurge.Among the many other exciting and thought-provoking proposals that Jonathan putsforward in this book, one that I find particularly intriguing would, ifimplemented, have the potential to turn the tables again. As the new humanityemerges, there is no need to invent a new religion or equip it with a newinfrastructure—the churches themselves, so long instruments of spiritualoppression, have the potential to become instruments of spiritual liberationagain as they last were in Gnostic times. Among the more radicalized churches,Jonathan suggests, this could even involve “the dispensing of psychoactivesacraments.”On its own, however, spiritual liberation will never be enough. If the newhumans are to survive, Jonathan warns, they will also have to be “spiritualwarriors … capable of standing up to the Western materialism machine, so we cancreate sustainable societies that care for their citizens, harmonize with thecycles of nature, and receive and honor the vast healing light that quietlyconnects us all.”What’s great about Jonathan is that he doesn’t just talk the talk. He absolutelywalks the walk—whether as an energy healer, as a resolute explorer ofnon-ordinary realms, or as one of the four founding members of the amazinglysuccessful and controversial online magazine Reality Sandwich and the EvolverSocial Movement that grew out of it. Evolver’s local network of “Spores” isgrowing all over America and all over the world—a global community ofintelligent, open-minded people actively working for the birth of a newhumanity.Jonathan was part of it from the beginning, and he has a compelling story totell.—Graham Hancock, author of Fingerprints of the Gods and Supernatural: Meetingwith the Ancient Teachers of Mankind"},{"pageContent":"[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_004_r1.jpg][images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_L02_r1.jpg]JANUARY 17, 2011“HAD YOU TOLD ME A FEW YEARS AGO that I’d be here in Austin tonight talking withyou about Jesus, aliens, and ayahuasca, I would have laughed my ass off. As acynical secular materialist, I scoffed at anything mystical. I thought onlydirect political action made any real change in the world. As you may haveguessed, that perspective has been turned on its head.”The sixty-five people I was speaking to sat crammed on the shaggy beige carpetof the suburban, seventies-style living room that Monday night. They spilledinto the hallway and dining area, those in the back leaning forward to hear.Wide colorful tapestries of illuminated Buddhas, zodiac charts, and complexgeometrical Shipibo patterns covered the dank, wood-paneled walls so indicativeof the aesthetically challenged Me Decade. Ceramic manifestations of Shiva,Shakti, and Ganesha cluttered the fireplace mantle and plasma-TV shelf.I propped my back against the fireplace wall and fought extreme fatigue. I hadspent the weekend in ceremony with a Brazilian shaman, one of the heroic healingmasters who travel the underground railroad of ayahuasca scenes sprouting upacross America. I doubt I’ll ever understand why the DEA regards the mostpowerful medicine I’ve encountered, the sacred brew of the Amazon, as aSchedule-one controlled substance worth banning. Wearing a vest of seashells anda leather headband with yellow feathers sticking up from the back, the short,prune-faced shaman had me gulp down several viscid cups of the nasty tastinghallucinogen the two previous afternoons. I hardly slept that weekend andconsidered calling off tonight’s talk.But now, several years into an often sloppy and sometimes dangerous spiritualinitiation, I was accustomed to ego dismemberment. Although exhausted, my bodyfelt clear and light from having transmuted so many heavy vibrations over theweekend. Besides, I lived for these talks. These were stories I loved to tell,especially since I had forged through so many challenges to accumulate theexperiences.The crowd had the familiar look that my presentations tended to attract. Most ofthe people spilling out of the room were twenty to forty years old withsalon-sculpted hair accented by highlights and wearing horn-rimmed glasses,skinny black jeans, vintage printed tees, and American Apparel cotton hoodies.You could easily mistake them for Pabst-chugging hipsters if not for theiraccessories—spiral plug earrings, mandala-shaped necklaces, Peruvian indigenousbracelets, and bright shawls with designs based on Mandelbrot mathematics. I fitright in with my tan faux-suede jacket, blue jeans, Burning Man multicolornecklace, and turquoise Yawanawá beaded bracelet. I regretted not bringing theblack Australian cowboy hat that I usually broke out when I left New York City,a way to reconnect with my Colorado roots. This was Texas after all.During the earlier meet-and-greet over carrots and hummus, the attendees hadshared their passion for sustainable aquaponic food systems, non-debt-basedcomplementary currencies, and the politics of local rain harvesting—visionary,but practical approaches to social change. They were far more grounded andengaged than the angel-and-fairy-obsessed New Age flock, the sort ofself-involved meditators that I studiously avoided during my life as a politicalactivist.This group resembled others I had encountered over the last year—but with atwist. Ten months ago, I would have been lucky to attract a dozen people to thecorner of a coffee shop or vegan restaurant for these talks, which I playfullyand presumptuously titled Opening the World’s Heart Chakra. Now they were packedout. We even had to stop promoting them early so as not to overrun the spaces Iborrowed. Despite the crowd tonight, I knew that my dream of a solar-powered,permaculture-loving Austin was still just a dream. The hordes gobbling up cheapChinese- and Ecuadorian-produced clothes and electronics at all the Targets,Kmarts, and Walmarts across town vastly outnumbered our crew. Radical mysticsand spiritual activists like us were the foolhardy underdogs throwingcompostable paper wrenches into the gears of the massive consumer machine.“Before we start, let me ask everyone a question,” I said to the group. “Howmany of you feel that you are personally experiencing some type of initiatory orhealing process?” A number of hands languidly raised in the air, half bent atthe elbow. “No, really. Raise your hand high so we can all see.” Sixty-threearms stretched firmly upwards, leaving only two people with their hands in theirlaps. “Look around at your brothers and sisters in the room.” I had never saidthe phrase “brothers and sisters” before—not with a straight face—but there wassomething about the brutal cleansing of the weekend’s ceremony that led me toadd the sermon-like flair.“How many places in the country would you see this many hands raised in answerto that question?” I said to them. “Something is going on here—somethingpowerful.”As if we had just chanted an ancient incantation, the room suddenly buzzed withan unseen but visceral energy that brought smiles and sparkly eyes to the crowd.They gazed at each other, sensing the potential that comes from manifestingchange together. As the only one standing up, I acted as an antenna or lightningrod for the group. A warm energetic vibration rose up my spine and spread acrossmy shoulder blades, expanding my heart center. I couldn’t help but laugh withgratitude at the continually absurd life I had stumbled into. After a long,formidable journey, I encountered a touch of the mystical almost every day.“Okay, everybody. Put down your hands, and let’s get on with this story.”"},{"pageContent":"[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_005_r1.jpg]THE GREAT LOST HOPE[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_L02_r1.jpg]WE ENTERED THE PACKED CHELSEA CLUB, stealing attention from defeatedpresidential candidate Howard Dean on stage with our glittery tricornered hats,puffy lace shirts, and metallic starred-and-striped vests that gave us the lookof Benjamin Franklin after he jumped into a particle accelerator with ZiggyStardust. “Liberty!” we yelled, taking our natural place in front of the bar.The twenty-five of us were Greene Dragon, a street-theater media team namedafter the tavern where rowdy Bostonians planned the original Tea Party. As therock stars of the anti-war movement, we led a raucous American Revel-utionagainst King George II (Bush) and his corporate tyranny. True to our historicalunderpinnings, we also liked to drink.For that unforgettable summer of 2004, we made Manhattan our politicalplayground: unfurling a thirty-foot canvas Declaration of Independence down thesteps of Federal Hall, warning Lexington Avenue “the Republicans are coming!”during our Paula Revere’s ride on horse-cycle (half bike, half horse), andstaging a crossing of New York Harbor (Delaware style) alongside stunnedcommuters on the Staten Island Ferry. Our revel army defended the island fromthe Republican invaders who exploited the tragedy of September 11 for politicalgain. We sang refurbished Yankee songs and carried signs proclaiming Dissent IsPatriotic and End Corporate Tyranny as part of the half-million peopleprotesting the Republican National Convention at Madison Square Garden in thelargest protest ever held against a political convention in the United States.Glancing around the dark nightclub that night, Tuesday, November 2, I spottedvarious heroes from what my culture-jamming colleagues had called the “Summer ofHope,” a time when our creative media antics and direct actions were aimed atdismantling the Bush death machine. Hailing from Crawford, Texas, thebikini-clad Missile Dick Chicks gripped phallic papier-mâché missiles and sang“Shop! In the Name of War” and “These Bombs Are Made for Droppin’.” Thered-nosed Rebel Clown Army mimed the absurdity of Mission Accomplicated. Dressedin second-hand tuxedos, top hats, ball dresses, and imitation pearls, theBillionaires for Bush hoisted signs calling for Four More Wars, Leave NoBillionaire Beyond, and Blood for Oil. They had pulled off one of the greateststunts of the summer: delivering a fake Karl Rove in a Lincoln Town Car to aRepublican fundraiser fifteen minutes before the real Rove arrived.With the media hyping that the Republican convention in New York would be areplay of Chicago ’68, normally marginalized activists found themselves thecenter of international attention. My friends became the eye candy of themovement, using glitzy costumes, viral memes, and strategic messaging to blastnormally staid political ideas onto headlines and TV screens. Using the “MarilynManson approach,” as I called it—the shinier your costume, the more headlinesyou make—my group Greene Dragon appeared on ABC, CBS, CNN, and MSNBC and indozens of newspapers. I even had my own photo shoot for New York Magazine,although the headline next to my flag-draped profile on the glossy’s coverarticulated a looming question about our tactics: “The Circus is coming to town.A Bush-hating nation of freaks, flash-mobbers, and civil-disobedients isgathering to spoil the GOP’s party. Is this any way to win an election?”On the mike that evening, a sweating Howard Dean alluded to these concerns as hepointed at a large electoral map projected behind him. “Everything we’ve workedfor depends on Florida and Ohio. If we pick up one of those states, we win. Ifnot, well … let’s just cross our fingers.”My eyes fixed on those two white shapes. The rest of the map quickly filled in apatchwork of red and blue. It seemed absurd that the success or failure of anentire year of my life—and the lives of my friends—depended on two spotschanging from white to our preferred hue.“General America, let me get you a drink.” Pen Franklin, a fellow patriot,ordered me our standard, a Sam Adams. “To the Revel-ution,” he clicked my glass.At twenty-nine, I did not have the experience, or the silver hair, to be ageneral. In fact, I had grown a goatee and long brown sideburns just to lookcloser to my age—bar bouncers always thought I was under twenty-one. But I didwear the outfit: a George Washington overcoat lined with Tron-like EL wire thatilluminated bar patrons several stools away, shiny sky-blue fabric for my pantsand vest, and silver stars glittering from my ankles to my shoulders. I carrieda sword wrapped in the Bill of Rights on tea-dyed paper. In my regalia, Iswaggered up to journalists proclaiming that this was my weapon of choice. Atthe time, I thought that others found the outfit inspired, but as Fox Newscalled Florida for the Republicans later that night, everythingchanged—including how I felt about my costume. It now wavered on the ridiculous.I felt the same about the name I had taken, Jonny America.Since my teenage years, I had read obsessively about revolution. Whether it wasthe French, American, Velvet, sexual, or psychedelic, I wanted to be part of it.But spending most of my time writing unpublished novels, I didn’t take actionuntil I worked for The September 11th Fund’s Ongoing Recovery Program. I hadrecently returned to the U.S. after several years of teaching English in Europe.As an intake specialist, I found employment and medical assistance for those whohad lost jobs or apartments around the World Trade Center. The midtown officewhere I worked was under renovation. The crumbling concrete walls and tornstrips of gray carpet unnerved clients, perhaps reminding them of horrors theyhad lived through.One day, a three-hundred-pound African American man named Lester, wearing awhite Knicks jersey under denim overalls, sat down with me to fill out forms.His thighs spilled over his folding chair. Grotesque red and white scales flakedoff the skin of Lester’s neck from what we Funders called “the Ground Zerorash,” a medical condition the Bush administration still denied. He coughedbetween words, speaking in a raspy voice, which I knew would only get worse overtime.“I used to have a great job bar-backing at Windows on the World,” Lesterwhispered while penciling in answers on a clipboard form. “Now I sell lawnchairs. I can’t feed two kids selling lawn chairs. George Bush spends millionson Halliburton, but he lets my family rot,” Lester’s voice dove into a growl.“He told us it was safe to stay around Ground Zero—it wasn’t safe. And now he’scoming back to our city to steal himself another election!”Lester dropped the clipboard and stood up. At first, he leaned forward,struggling to catch his breath. His back straightened, and his hands pumped intofists by his sides. Lester’s eyes darted around the room as if looking forescape. Then he lurched toward me. I backed away, but it was too late; he hadpulled me into an inescapable bear squeeze. His belly began to shake. He wascrying—really crying. The muscles in his arms and legs collapsed, and I used allof the 135 pounds of my runner’s body to hold him. “I’m doing everything I can,but these guys are wrecking me,” Lester coughed. “I can’t feed my kids sellinglawn chairs. I’m just thankful there are people like you to help.” He gripped mefor several minutes, his tears blotting my collar. I had always been an overlysensitive person—delicado, as my Spanish girlfriend had called me. Lester’sgrief sank into my chest like a dark stone; it wasn’t every day you saw a manthis big break down.After meeting Lester, I could no longer be an armchair revolutionary. I joinedmy neighborhood group, Peace Williamsburg, and attended rallies anddemonstrations against the Iraq War. But given my bohemian inclinations, Iwanted to do something bolder and more artistic than simply marching in largegroups down city boulevards. The media didn’t seem interested in those boringtactics anyway. At that time, a friend introduced me to Abbie Hoffman’sRevolution for the Hell of It. Reading about the Yippies’ escapades dumpingmoney on the Stock Exchange floor, levitating the Pentagon (or at least trying),and running a pig named Pigasus for president in 1968 inspired me that one couldsnag media attention by using humor and absurdist theater, along with a taste ofbravado.Growing up in Idaho Springs, Colorado, I had been the instigator of pranks andstunts in my mountain town, such as sledding to the prom in a tuxedo andwater-ballooning the senior campout. Thanks to Abbie, I saw how I could use myown trickster nature to party-crash CNN headlines. The days of handwrittenprotest signs were over in our society of spectacle. With the right visualpyrotechnics and clever stunt making, a small visionary group could entice theattention of the twenty-four-hour news cycle, reaching more viewers thanold-school marches with thousands of people.Die-ins had been popular among protestors during the invasion of Iraq, but theylacked the glitzy hook that appealed to media outlets. So I teamed up with adozen activists that I met through Peace Williamsburg, and we organized adifferent type of die-in on the Rockefeller Center skating rink. The actionwould reveal what it felt like to have our national landmarks bombed, as wasbeing done in Baghdad. It also had a surrealist Ice Capades touch. We sent outpress releases mentioning “civil disobedience,” a dangerous term that broughtout three hundred cops in ant-black riot gear, the SWAT team, and even a policehelicopter, along with the television cameras. At three o’clock, our pointperson among the tourists at ground level dropped a banner onto the ice:Operation Iraqi Freedom: Who Profits, Who Pays? Skating in circles, we tore offour winter coats, unveiling blood-soaked T-shirts. Screams swirled around us,camera bulbs assaulted the back of my lids, officers barked out orders, but acalm chill lay over the ice as a tiny girl asked, “Mommy, mommy, why are theylying down in red?” “Honey,” her mother responded, “they believe the war iswrong.”I thought of that girl and what it would be like if our cities and homes weregetting bombed, and I thought of my own sister and what it would be like to loseher, my family, and my friends. Then I imagined those Iraqi mothers in heavycotton robes, wailing outside ruined mosques and hospitals. I was surprised tofeel the wailing come into me, up from the earth; there were hundreds, thousandsof mothers crying at once. The sobs were absorbed into my lungs and began toshake through me, as if they were coming from some other plane of existence. Isuspected I was being delicado again, until I saw the rest of our crew wipingtheir cheeks. Later—after the police handcuffed us and untied our skates, afterwe were piled into the steel police van, after twenty-three hours of eatingstale sandwiches in Manhattan’s Tombs—we would recount how, for each of us,crying on the ice had been the first time we had a sense of what it meant tolive in a country at war.Despite the emotional resonance of that experience, however, afterward Iquestioned the impact of the die-ins, arrests, and negative rhetoric of theanti-war, anti-Bush, anti-corporate movement. What did we stand for? Whatdifference were we making? What power did we have? And when did we get to havefun and dance? So I took a break from activism to attend my first Burning Manfestival. The project’s website described Burning Man as an “annual art eventand temporary community based on radical self-expression and self-reliance inthe Black Rock Desert of Nevada.” When my friends and I arrived at the gates,sexy Mad Max women in bikinis and biker goggles hugged me, the “newbie,” andsaid, “Welcome home.”One of my Peace Williamsburg friends had invited me to stay at his camp. What Ithought would be a homey gathering replete with propane stoves, s’mores, andburned potatoes in tin foil turned out to be a twenty-four-hour techno ravecalled Disorient with LED strobe lights assailing my tent throughout the night.Unable to sleep, I wandered through the desert playa dust, past domed themecamps of Mars mazes, yoga dens, and homemade roller coasters; art cars ofpsychedelic dragons, four-legged robots, and mushroom caps; temples made ofspare parts from dinosaur models; gigantic light installations for bleary-eyednight trippers; and the four-story-tall, alien-headed wooden Man perched atop athirty-foot pyramid, ready to burn.While thirty thousand neo-tribal characters celebrated their return “home,” theopen-air hall of eccentricities brought out a familiar existential terror andloneliness from inside me. For as long as I could remember, I had been carrying“the black bowling ball,” as I called it, a recurrent melancholy, sometimesrising into panic attacks. I was sure this bleakness had its roots in mymother’s frequent angry criticisms when I was a child. It followed me wherever Iwent—slinging coffee in downtown Denver, roaming the spiraling cobblestonestreets of Prague, or fighting off hangovers in the stands during bullfights inSpain. It was at its worst during my Terrible Twenties—that time when theexcitement of college had ended and I realized that our society doesn’t havemuch to offer if you aren’t inspired by day jobs, duplexes, movie nights, andpension plans. Even travel, I learned, had its limits. This was the feeling oflife without magic.On Wednesday, I sat down next to a roller disco on the Esplanade, the festival’smain thoroughfare, to watch a pink sunset evaporate over the Black RockMountains. A bare-breasted woman in a purple wig and day-glow shorts circled therink’s wooden floor. Behind her, the festival’s lamplighters, dressed inceremonial white togas with red flames tickling up the sides, silently placedoil lamps on the street. Behind them, a horned satyr on stilts grumbled by. Pasthim, a pirate-ship art car chased a great white whale on wheels. Behind that, anoctopus sculpture burned, and three parachutists circled in through the plumingsmoke.I realized that if I had seen any one of these events in New York, it would havemade my afternoon, but witnessing them all at once hurtled the limits of myactivism in front of my dust-flecked eyes. I saw it so clearly: I had been doingpolitics all wrong. I had been fighting against institutions, thinking I was anunderground rebel, when what I really needed to do was take the playful,imaginative, and joyful essence of this place and funnel it into the activistsphere. These Burners didn’t complain and argue about society. They built a cityof their dreams, with a thriving gift economy and vibrant culture thatencouraged all participants to let loose their wildest, most glorious freak.They weren’t protesting; they were celebrating.On Saturday evening before the festival’s organizers burned the Man, my themecamp rounded up all the newbies to receive their playa names from the communityelder—a nudist, poly-amorous medical doctor named Gorilla. “What’s your biggestdream?” Gorilla asked when it was my turn. “You know, the one so big you’re tooafraid to even tell yourself.” I told him I wanted to be part of some kind ofrevolution, revival, or renaissance. He asked what name reflected that wish, andI remembered back to my expat days in Prague. A big-boned English woman, Angela,who could drink any soccer hooligan under the table, would shout “JonnyAmerica!” every time I entered a bar. That name gave me the permission andconfidence to misbehave in deliciously sinful ways.It later granted me the inspiration to become the general of a small AmericanRevel-ution when I returned to New York. As General Jonny America, I recruitedGreene Dragon members, encouraging them to create their own superhero patriotpersonae—Phreedom Phil, Revel Girl, Pen Franklin, John Hancocktail, Sham Adams,Liberty Belle, Molly Pitcher of Beer. (Since we named our group after a tavern,it seemed only natural that a number of the members had names referring toalcohol.) Our mission was to connect people with the positive aspects of ourcountry’s heritage and its promise of democracy. We directly challenged Bush’scharge that “You’re either with us or against us” by showing that dissent held apivotal role in the American creation story. And, admittedly, the Revolutionmade for a mythic storyline, a media tractor beam.After years of writing alone in cramped rooms, I happily led our band of merrypatriots onto the stages of political rallies, cajoling the police to allow ournon-permitted events, reframing issues so that even the hecklers took our side,and rattling off sound bite after sound bite to throngs of the press. Our mottowas “It’s All About the Reveling.” Remembering the inspiration of Burning Man, Iwould take us back to that essence whenever we would lose our way.Pranksters, I discovered, can come from joy and integrity when the actions andideas manifest from the heart. Every once in a while, however, the black bowlingball would squash my reveling, and I would disappear for a day or two until thepanic attacks subsided and Jonny America could reemerge. One day I would besparring on air with MSNBC anchors, who were upset about my wearing a patriotcostume in their studio; the next day I would be holed up in my Williamsburgapartment, not ever answering my phone. That summer and fall, I danced throughthe ups and downs of the wounded trickster archetype—assuming there is such athing.Despite the occasional appearance of my shadow side, we found that our GreeneDragon revel-ations provided a healing space for others, such as the elderlywoman in a pink flowered hat who signed our Declaration of Independence and saidwith tears in her eyes, “This is the first time I’ve felt like an American sinceSeptember 11.” We got that a lot. Then again, many activists thought I was naïvefor pushing these lofty ideals and for creating such campy, patriotic messaging.Part of my idealism may have stemmed from my habit of wanting to be seen as anice guy or trying too hard to please others. But my goal wasn’t to expound onhistorical intricacies. I wanted to win an election, and to do that we had toreach out to the mainstream.On Election Day, when the results were in, Howard Dean’s worst-case scenariocame to pass. Not long before midnight, Fox News called Ohio for Bush, with NBCfollowing shortly afterward. The frozen, silent faces around the room said itall—we were in for another four years of the Bush war doctrine. Our costumes,flash mobs, and Temporary Autonomous Zones had proved ineffective against theRepublicans’ $270 million campaign blitz.After an unusually quiet Manhattan minute, the Dadaist-inspired Hungry MarchBand, in their mime-meets-cabaret outfits, broke into an awkward saxophone-heavydirge. Members of the “artivist” collectives hugged, mixed, and slowly dancedtogether in despair. Greene Dragon hoisted a final toast of “Liberty!”—defeatedbut trying to stay strong. I left soon afterward so my team wouldn’t see theblack bowling ball roll over me."},{"pageContent":"[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_006_r1.jpg]EDEN:TROUBLE IN PARADISE[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_L02_r1.jpg]THE NEXT MORNING, a Blade Runner drizzle engulfed the city. From the bed of mythree-windowed room, a luxury in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, I looked through theslats of the fire escape on a sea of black umbrellas rushing along HavemeyerStreet. The clock already read 12:30, but I couldn’t bother calling in sick tomy new temp job at the Grand Army Plaza public library. At times like this, Iwished The September 11th Fund’s money hadn’t run out—they would have forgiven aday without reporting in. I had already turned off my phone, so I didn’t have todeal with more consolatory calls, but that didn’t stop my two activistroommates, Wynn and Gabe, from shouting through my bedroom door. “Jonny, it’scrazy. We all said there’d be riots in the street if Bush won, but everyone’stoo depressed to do anything!”Gazing at the brown sludge-water pouring into the storm drains along thesidewalk, I brooded that afternoon over the abysmal condition of our planet.Constant wars, corporate domination, and military regimes plagued nations on allcontinents. The World Health Organization estimated that one-third of theworld’s people were underfed and another third starving, but governments stillrefused to make a consolidated effort to alleviate the situation. In Greenlandand West Antarctica alone, 360 billion metric tons of ice had melted theprevious year. If this continued over the next few decades, scientists predictedcostal regions would flood, pushing large populations into resource-strippedlands.Heavy metals, toxic waste, and pesticide runoff contaminated our life-givingrivers and oceans, while a half-century of industrial fishing had wiped out overninety percent of the world’s big fish population. Polar bears had traces ofTeflon in their bloodstreams, Beijing residents were wearing gas masks to work,and the Amazon rainforest—the lungs of our planet—was losing eighty to ninetythousand acres per day to oil drilling and cattle ranching. With six billion ofus consuming, polluting, and reproducing, the biosphere had plunged into seriousdistress. Thirty thousand species were becoming extinct each year, three speciesevery hour. Humans were annihilating the planet’s extraordinary web of life,creating the Sixth Great Extinction.Despite all our computers, high-temperature superconductors, and complexinformation systems, our problems continued to worsen as we fast approached amega-crisis. I wondered if there was some unseen impetus causing all thedevastation and suffering, something bigger than all our governments andcorporations combined. I had pinned Bush as the focus of my protests, but theseproblems had deeper roots, something far greater than any one presidentialcandidate could handle. Did I really think John Kerry, another alumnus of Skulland Bones, could lead us out of our plight?For the next month, between random temp jobs, dates with my new girlfriend Jade,and spells of post-election depression, I studied Western history. This time Ididn’t review the incendiary sparks of revolution, but the emergence of militaryempires, including the American, Nazi, British, Spanish, Ottoman, Roman, andGreek. I traced back the bloody trail of war, slavery, domination, andsubjugation until I found myself unexpectedly leaping out of historical datesand facts and into the mythological basis of Judeo-Christian culture—thebiblical tale of Eden. Of course, I didn’t believe that this creation storyaccurately chronicled the history of earth’s first humans, but it did holdprevailing thought forms and belief systems that eventually shaped all ofWestern civilization.Having endured a childhood of boring Methodist sermons, I was initiallydismissive of this ancient story, but then I considered how the great thinkersof the past didn’t have astrophysics, the Hubble Telescope, and Doppler radar toexplain the universe; they conveyed information through the knowledge-system ofthe period, meaning myth and storytelling. If that were true, Genesis couldprovide a map or guidebook to help us understand where we came from and how wegot to where we are today.That seemed to be the point in the opening lines of the Bible: “In the beginningGod created the heavens and the earth. The earth was formless and void, anddarkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was moving overthe surface of the waters. Then God said, ‘Let there be light’; and there waslight. God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from thedarkness. God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And therewas evening and there was morning, one day.”1[Phil_9781583943434_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts001] (Gen. 1:1) From the endlessvoid, light bursts into being, creating the first and greatest event in cosmichistory, birthing the stars, sun, moon, and sky, and later the plants andanimals of the earth.On the seventh day, God rested, then “formed man of dust from the ground, andbreathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.”(Gen. 2:7) This was Adam, created from dust and eventually split into twoseparate beings—man and woman, reflecting the yin/yang nature of the space–timecontinuum.In Eden, the serpent, a worldwide symbol of transformation, challenges Eve totest out a new way of perceiving her reality by eating the forbidden fruit.“Indeed, has God said, ‘You shall not eat from any tree of the garden’?… Yousurely will not die! For God knows that in the day you eat from it your eyeswill be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” (Gen. 3:1–5)Eve and Adam eat the fruit, and their eyes open to a different vision of theworld, an amazing and frightening one of duality and danger. With good comesevil, with life comes death, with self comes other, and with every aspect of thecosmos arises its equal and daunting opposite. Fear emerges from this newseparation and Adam admits to God, “I was afraid because I was naked; so I hidmyself.” (Gen. 3:10)Tasting of the Tree of Knowledge, Adam and Eve undergo a powerful initiationinto self-awareness, but another step in their development still lay ahead. Godwarns, “Behold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil; andnow, he might stretch out his hand, and take also from the tree of life, andeat, and live forever.” (Gen. 3:22) I had never heard a minister call attentionto these lines, even though they are in the widely referenced first book of theBible. The passage states that if humans eat from the Tree of Life, they becomelike God, living forever. But what kind of radical shift in consciousness didthis tree represent?Adam and Eve’s theft of knowledge reminded me of the Greek myth of Prometheusstealing fire from the heavens. As punishment, the vengeful Olympian gods chainPrometheus to a rock, where a vulture endlessly feeds on his regenerating liver,mimicking the retribution in Genesis. The story of Prometheus depicts theintroduction of fire to humans for cooking, sharpening weapons, and other uses.They had integrated a divine power into their lives, and there was a price topay for acquiring the technology. Fire can be used to make our lives easier, butwe also risk getting burned.A popular hypothesis among biblical scholars and writers is that, like thePrometheus story, the story of Adam and Eve also describes a profound social andscientific development in human history—in this case, the agriculturalrevolution. The Garden of Eden represents a tribal way of life, where Adam andEve live in leisurely harmony with the cycles of nature among the abundance ofthe “birds of the air” and “beasts of the field.” As punishment for eating theforbidden apple, God curses… the ground because of you;In toil you will eat of itAll the days of your life.Both thorns and thistles it shall grow for you;And you will eat the plants of the field;By the sweat of your faceYou will eat bread. (Gen. 3:17–19)Exiled from Eden, Adam and Eve struggle to survive by means of their own labor,eating “the plants of the field.” It’s interesting to note that the Bible namesthe four rivers that surround Eden—the Pishon, Gihon, Tigris, and Euphrates,which places the biblical Garden in the middle of the Fertile Crescent, thebirthplace of civilization.The agricultural revolution ten to twelve thousand years ago restructured humancommunities from tribal living and nomadic hunting to permanent settlements thatallowed for higher populations and increased technological developments, as wellas greater material inequity. We witness this phenomenon almost immediatelyafter the expulsion from Eden. Adam and Eve’s sons Cain and Abel toil away atthe new agricultural technologies of their time—Abel domesticated animals, andCain grew crops. God plays the role of a landowner who is given offerings. WhenAbel pleases God with a more honest return, a jealous Cain kills his brother,committing the first act of violence in Western civilization, at least inbiblical terms.The stored wealth from agriculture led to the manipulation of food supplies,creating social hierarchies of haves and have-nots. The agricultural revolutionallowed the production of much higher caloric yields and enabled the developmentof city-states, nations, empires, and ultimately the multinational corporationswe see today.The dark side of this shift in human restructuring is depicted in the shame andsuffering Adam and Eve experienced in being expelled from Eden. In leaving thetribal and nomadic way of life for agricultural settlements, our ancestors cameto know a deep sense of separation, shame, abandonment, scarcity, and judgment.That shadow spread with the expansion of the three great religions—Judaism,Christianity, and Islam. Humans inherited the guilt of original sin, beingunworthy of God’s love, living according to laws that determined right and wrongand good and bad for them. They spent their existence in exile from God,segregated from the earth’s cycles, killing their own mother with the tools theyfashioned from her resources.Shaming Eve for her discovery, the Eden tale ushered in thousands of years ofunchecked patriarchy:To the woman He said,“I will greatly multiplyYour pain in childbirth,In pain you will bring forth children;Yet your desire will be for your husband,And he will rule over you.” (Gen. 3:16)Time now ran in a masculine, linear mode as warring, egocentric powers fought toexpand their territories. Individuals fended for themselves, struggling in aseparation consciousness, running away from their own fears and inadequacies,abandoned by their parental God-figure.Looking at the immense ramifications of the fall from Eden, I realized that myold political tactics would prove useless against the corrupt operating systemthat ran the civilized world. Einstein claimed that you can’t solve a problemwith the same thinking you used to create that problem. If humans are going toput a stop to the Sixth Great Extinction, we’ll need a Galileo-type paradigmshift. When that seventeenth-century astronomer proved that the Earth revolvedaround the sun, he revolutionized not only the way that people looked at largeobjects in the sky, but also eventually every particle of our lives.In early December, my roommates Wynn and Gabe hosted a convergence night fortwenty affinity group leaders at my apartment. The activists were rethinkingtactics after losing the election. Wearing thrift-store jeans and screen-printedT-shirts from the various organizations they represented, they ate vegan oatmealcookies in a circle on the hardwood floor, grumbling that the media wereneglecting their events. Gabe scribbled everyone’s ideas on dresser-sizednotepads hanging off our living room wall. The activists had been reading GeorgeLakoff’s Don’t Think of an Elephant!, which advocated framing messages in a waythat reached across the political spectrum. Since that had been Greene Dragon’sforte, a number of the participants asked me what I thought. They still calledme Jonny America. “You can call me Jonathan,” I said, feeling as if the monikerhad become as obsolete as Betamax now that Bush had convincingly won anelection.Then I asked, “What if we pulled the stage back further, beyond Democrats andRepublicans, all the way back to the Garden of Eden and the beginning of Westerncivilization? Do you think there’s a way to reframe that story, which is apowerful creation myth, so that we aren’t a culture in exile?”Eyes around the room blinked without response. One of the unshaven, Time’s Up!bicycle advocates spoke up. “Jonny, are you turning religious on us?” he asked.Being spiritual in these circles was worse than turning Republican. I hunched myshoulders until the meeting was over. Afterward, my roommate Gabe opened my doorto see if I was okay. I told him that the world was too messed up for politicsto fix—that I was looking for a paradigm shift—but not being a visionaryscientist or philosopher, I had no idea where to look.“Maybe you’ll be like my Rolfing clients,” he offered. “When they realizethey’re not just meat-bodies, but vibrating energy beings, it changes theirworldview from Newtonian to quantum.”I wasn’t sure what he meant by “quantum,” and as a practicing rationalist, Iwasn’t ready to make any giant leaps into dogma or unexplained phenomena. Still,there was an intuitive part of me that believed the story of Eden possessedanswers beyond the reach of my hard-edged intellect. So I researched strange webportals, mythic corners, and historical alleyways over the next couple ofmonths, but whatever I was looking for always seemed around some unreachablecorner. I was chasing rainbows. The more I walked toward my destination, thefurther it drifted away from me."},{"pageContent":"[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_007_r1.jpg]A GALILEO-TYPE PARADIGM SHIFT[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_L02_r1.jpg]“YOU’VE BEEN WORRYING ABOUT POLITICS and paradigm shifts for weeks,” my newgirlfriend Jade said over the phone. “It’s Valentine’s Day, and almost yourthirtieth birthday. Tonight, you’re going to take some MDMA with your lady andget your butt on the dance floor,” she giggled at her own orders.Jade lived in a brownstone a few blocks from me at Bedford Avenue and North 7thStreet, Williamsburg’s hipster version of Haight-Ashbury. Having keys, I walkedin to find Jade jumping on her mattress in heels, singing Bon Jovi’s “Livin’ ona Prayer” into an S-and-M whip that doubled as a microphone. She kicked out aleg, swung her pelvis into my shoulder, and held the whip to my lips for thechorus, “We’re halfway there!” For the past few months, I had unsuccessfullyeducated her on the underground rock legends in her own backyard—The Ramones,Television, Velvet Underground, Patti Smith.Born and raised in Plainview, Long Island, Jade was the first girl I dated whosang Bon Jovi without irony. She came from a professional, northeastern Jewishbackground with accountant parents, doctors for siblings, and lawyers throughoutthe extended family. Jade had flourished as a TV and radio producer, but sheabandoned that career to follow her dream of becoming, as she explained in herblog, a “sex educator, porn-maker, masturbation advocate, and feminist who feelswe all have the right to express ourselves the way we move ourselves.” Jadewrote a sex-advice column for a mainstream glossy magazine and fitted men andwomen with cordless vibrators, silicon lubes, and mechanical spanking devices ather part-time job at Toys in Babeland on the Lower East Side. She also wrote adating column for a New Jersey weekly that featured her new romantic exploitswith “the cowboy”—me.Like me, Jade had a flair for media. She understood how to message sexualliberation in a fun, non-threatening way. She hosted erotic educational videosfor partners, dressing in the bright colors of the Power Puff girls—pink, babyblue, and lime green—while dropping cute double-entendres throughout the shoots.Unlike me, she had found a way to make a living doing what she loved—but I’msure sex has always paid better than activism.The thing we had most in common was Burning Man, which explained our outfits.Jade wore black slim pants, a silver metallic half top, and super-hero gold bandaround her waist—“The Short Jewish Wonder Woman,” she explained while dapplingsilver glitter around her eyes. With long black curls falling down her neck, shehad the semblance of the Amazon heroine.I was wearing black pants and a red faux-fur vest, along with my usual cowboyboots with silver flames on the top. My Australian cowboy hat sat on my head,although I rarely wore it anymore after receiving too many “Yippee ki yays!”from African American teenagers in the subway. They just didn’t understand thealt-cowboy look. Of course, the costuming and outfitting had a way of gettingout of hand in the Burner scene, with partiers constantly out-dazzling eachother.“Rena’s one of my best friends,” Jade said, grabbing her keys. “We wereroommates for years, but she never goes out. That’s why you haven’t met her yet.She hates people.” We walked out the door and down the stoop, to the taxihonking for us. A middle-aged woman—ten years older than Jade and me—with anIrish-red ponytail and Celtic ruby skin opened the door. “I think she might helpyou with your paradigm shift,” Jade whispered before we got in.Jade introduced us. Rena kept her arms folded and didn’t shake my hand. She hada wooden posture and lean biceps, and if not for the white dress she waswearing, you might mistake her for a man. She kept her glance out the windowwhile Jade pieced together a conversation. Jade had mentioned that Rena neverleft the ten-block radius of her Madison Square Park apartment, so this Brooklynadventure may have been too much for her.The taxi arrived at a warehouse space in the slowly gentrifying neighborhood ofProspect Heights. A sign on the graffitied door welcomed us to “The BassNympho’sBall: A Radical Subsonic Romp of Orgiastic Plenty,” celebrating the New Yorkreturn of Bassnectar, one of my favorite Burning Man DJs. We walked upstairs tothe second floor where people were dancing in their best Conan the Barbarianchic—buckled leather pants and metal arm bracelets for the men, post-apocalypticbelly-dancing garb for the ladies.Jade, Rena, and I converged in a far corner and clicked our Pac Man–etched MDMApills in a toast. I had tried ecstasy a couple of times before at raves inPrague, but the clammy cement lots, alienating techno, and stiff Slavic dancemoves made for long, isolating nights. I hoped for a much cozier experience forthis birthday celebration.“One last hurrah for your twenties!” Jade swallowed her pill, smiling at me withher mouse eyes—not like the eyes of real mice, but the wide, mischievous onesyou find in cartoons.“Happy Valentine’s Day,” I said, giving her a kiss.Jade wanted to show Rena around the space. I hit the dance floor with theagreement that we would meet up later. I watched Jade—an ace aticebreakers—intentionally bump into strangers on the sidelines, elbowing areluctant Rena to join the conversations, occasionally hunkering over in a bellylaugh or a snort. I usually needed my Jonny America persona to display Jade’skind of courage. Part of me still felt frozen from enduring years of my mother’sverbal attacks as a child (although she hadn’t yelled at me in years), andJade’s constant slapstick humor shed light on how serious I could be.I tried not to think about it too much that night. Bassnectar’s down-and-dirtyindustrial pulse pierced through my chest. DJ Lorin, the mastermind behind theproject, bopped his head in the DJ booth. He was wearing a blood-red shirt witha print of Guevara, Hendrix, or Dylan—I couldn’t tell which, because hiswaist-long black hair obscured the details. He wore dark eyeliner, something Ialways appreciated in a slightly androgynous guy who could pull it off well.Moving with the electronic blasts, I danced away my concerns of the previous fewmonths. All the thoughts and worry about the Sixth Great Extinction slipped outof my pores. I was back in my body, dissolving in the moment, feeling a euphoricconnection with everyone on the dance floor. From the blissed-out faces and longarm caresses around me, I assumed others had indulged in MDMA as well.While dancing, I found myself wondering what my first girlfriend—who hadchristened the backseat of my Datsun 310 with me—was up to these days. As Ientertained the thought, a tall woman with dark hair similar to hers grabbed mywrist. “You look just like my first boyfriend,” she said. She was six-feet twoand, as I top out just under five-feet nine, I joked that kissing must have beena challenge.When she left, I watched a man wearing pink silk pants, furry white wings, and ajester’s hat hula-hooping on stage. I had seen him at a number of warehouseparties, but I regretted being too timid to introduce myself, as he seemed to befun. (How many guys wear wings?) At that moment, he leaped off stage toward me.“Jonny America, we love what you’re doing in the media. You’re representing therest of us!” Taken aback, I didn’t tell him the General now lay folded up amidmothball packets in my closet.After that, I wished Jade would come find me. That’s when I felt someone dryhumping the back of my leg. “Well, hello, Mr. America.” Jade reached around andspun me toward her. She was smiling, her teeth glowing green under the blacklights. The ecstasy had kicked in for both of us. We kissed longer than usual,feeling the vibration of the bass in our spines.Perhaps it was just the MDMA, but my heart felt as if it grew bigger againstJade, so much so that I whispered, “I love you.”It was the first time I had told her those words. She pushed me back andexamined my eyes. Her brow furrowed, forming wide wrinkles that made her lookold. “Are you in love with me?” she asked.Although a mysterious chemistry drew us together at the art party where we firstmet, we never did have a honeymoon phase, at least I didn’t. Jade was fun,creative, savvy, and sharp, and when she dressed like Wonder Woman or in aBurning-Man goddess outfit, I couldn’t hold myself off her. But she had weightconcerns and when she plodded around in baggy corduroys, complaining about allthe mashed potatoes she had eaten for lunch, my interest waned, making me feelshallow and guilty. Also, she had a “Rottweiler temper,” as she herself calledit. After growing up with my mother, I had sworn that I would stay away fromwomen like that, at least on a long-term basis.I gave her a hug, resting my chin on her shoulder. “I love you,” I said again.“Come on,” Jade grabbed my hand. “Let’s find Rena.”We walked down to the first floor and discovered Rena lounging in the chillroom. She had undone her ponytail, and her red hair flowed onto the velvetpillows next to her. Rena looked feminine, relaxed, and carefree. In the taxi,her presence had been so intimidating that I didn’t realize how tiny sheactually was. She looked like an Irish fairy.“What happened to you?” I asked.“I let my guard down,” Rena said.A canopy of red lace draped down from the ceiling, and people were massagingeach other in cuddle puddles on the pillows scattered around the room. Jade andI squeezed in next to Rena.“Rena can see auras.” Jade said, stroking Rena’s forearm, which hosted a tattooof an old cottonwood tree with long gray roots.I found this amusing. I used to make fun of new-age freaks who believed ininvisible glowy things. “Okay, if you can see auras, what do ours look like?”At first, Rena frowned at my request, but then she focused her eyes severalinches above me, squinting. “A bluish-green,” she said. “Both of you. You’re anice match. Your energies even sound the same, something likeHarrrrrrrrrrruuuummmmmm.”“We sound like refrigerators.” Jade clapped her hands, laughing.“Well, it is electricity,” Rena explained. “That’s what makes the aurasilluminate. In fact, everyone in this room, and every object in the universe, ishigh-voltage spiritual electricity—or energy, you might say.”I lay down in Jade’s lap, unsure what to think. Rena had such a scientific tonethat it discharged some of my hippie associations with the word aura. Herperspective seemed more about seeing energy, a physical phenomenon, rather thanimagining some luminous phantasm. Rena put her hands on my shoulders; her palmswere hot as steam irons. My breath drew deeper, and I noticed the feeling oftiny molecules, millions of them, going in my nose, down my throat, into mylungs and abdomen, and then back out again. To my surprise, the “spiritualelectricity” that Rena had talked about pulsated through me, flowing in and outof my body. Jade held her hand to my mouth as I took longer inhalations to pumpenergy through my legs, arms, and chest. The energy felt strange andinvigorating, but somehow familiar too, and I breathed again and again untilRena told me not to overdo it.We stayed in the chill space until 4 a.m., when Rena said she needed to go home.The cab dropped Jade and me off at my apartment. While I was in the bathroom, Ilet out another yoga-type exhale. A puff of steam blew out of my mouth. I huffeda couple of times to see if the bathroom was cold enough to freeze my breath,but the heater hissed in the corner. I went back to the bedroom, shaking myhead, almost scared of what this meant.“Jade, when I was in the bathroom, steam came out of my mouth. It’s not evencold in there.”“Of course. You did that the whole time we were in the chill room. Why do youthink I kept putting my hand in front of your mouth? It felt good.”“And you didn’t say anything?”“What’s the big deal? It can’t hurt you, silly. It’s just steam.”Jade slapped my butt as she walked toward the bathroom. I climbed into bed andstarred at the shadows stretching across the ceiling, thinking of all thecoincidences that had occurred that night. Suddenly I felt an invisible presenceappear near the bed. I was still high from the MDMA, and thought I was imaginingit. I closed my eyes, but the presence floated over my body like a ghost. Soft,warm energy began pouring onto my skin, sinking into my chest, whirling goldenenergy through my torso. The presence said only one word, a word sodisconcerting that I immediately sat up and threw off the covers, frighteningaway the apparition.When Jade came back to bed, she noticed something strange. “My arm looks hairy,like I’ve grown bear fur,” she snorted.Looking closer, I saw the hairs on her arm jumping around in fast-forwardmotion, making the strands appear much greater in number, as if she had fur.Then I saw a two-foot orb of blue-green light undulating around her head. Itlooked like foggy electricity and buzzed quietly, almost like a refrigerator.“This is it, Jade. We’re seeing auras, like Rena.”“Do you think I’ll look hairy in the morning?”“Maybe it will wear off with the MDMA. But we’re both seeing this, right? Wecan’t both be crazy?”“If you say so,” Jade gave a small yawn and turned over to sleep.An incandescent white glow silhouetted the nightstand, the armoire, and thedesk. Stumbling out of bed, I walked over to the long narrow mirror on the backof the door. A shimmering blue-green circle, two feet in diameter, enveloped myhead while a fainter gray illuminated my arms two or three inches out. The wholeenergy field pulsed like electricity. I stood there frozen, as if I were seeingmyself for the first time—a creature much different than I had previouslyimagined. That’s when I remembered the troubling word the presence had spoken tome.“Alien.”"},{"pageContent":"[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_008_r1.jpg]BEDTIME FOR GNOMES[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_L02_r1.jpg]“BAKER, BENDER, BELLE … CAN I HELP YOU?” I had fumbled this tongue twister overa hundred times answering the phone that Monday morning, wondering if the threeelderly partners had founded their architectural firm solely because ofalliteration. Dressed in soul draining, temp-worker khaki pants, a whitebutton-up shirt, and a dark blue striped tie, I manned the front desk of theUnion Square office, serving the reception needs of two hundred overworkedemployees.I had spent the last two weeks here, thinking I was doomed to tread my father’spath. Family members fought to be on his Trivial Pursuit team during reunions,knowing they would win. But somehow my father’s intelligence didn’t translate inthe job market, and he struggled to find work he enjoyed, often traveling far todo low-paying accounting jobs or drive a taxi in Denver. Over the summer, I hadworked at a West Village restaurant when I heard one of the customers—a woman ina Greenpeace T-shirt, whom I didn’t know—whisper across the table, “Why is JonnyAmerica busing tables?” That seemed to be the central question of my existence.But today was different. Everything was different. Although the colors hadfaded, I could still see luminescent energy fields undulating around thearchitects as they picked up long FedEx rolls from my desk. The auras shonestrongest around the head, pulsating like a mild, circle-shaped electricalstorm, but they also tapered lightly down the body in a glowing cloak ofundulating white light.Apparently, my new ability was not a one-night druggie side effect, but rather apermanent mutant state. The mixing and merging energy fields of the staffdistracted me throughout the afternoon. I neglected stocking the kitchen, forgotto make copies for accounts receivable, and knocked over the Nespresso machinein front of the partners in the conference room. My mind was also distracted bythe word alien throughout the day. It could mean anything strange or foreign, Itold myself, although I feared that was not what it meant. At 5:45, I received acall from Marty, my overly perky temp recruiter. “Baker, Bender, Belle calledtoday. They won’t need your services anymore. I’m sure we’ll find you somethingelse.”I walked to the bathroom, changed into my civilian clothes—brown fuzzy jacket,jeans, and silver-flamed cowboy boots—then wandered around the crooked elm treesof Tompkins Square Park, which was still a refuge for the romanticallyunemployed. I sat on a bench, my stomach seizing in another panic attack, as Iworried about next month’s rent.What good was seeing Rena’s spiritual energy? All it did was get me fired. Andhow would I explain this to my friends—or even worse, my parents? I hadn’ttrekked to some Indian ashram where an enlightened guru opened my third eye. No,I took a pill at a party. Then again, wasn’t that the most ancient method ofinitiation—getting people dancing and singing around a fire (or strobe lights ifin a Brooklyn warehouse party)? Whether it was bleary-eyed Bacchus-worshipersreveling with wine or Native Americans chanting over peyote in smoky teepees,many cultures utilized mind-altering sacraments to bring about shifts inconsciousness.While walking by a construction site near the housing projects on Avenue D, Inoticed a poster of Jesus plastered across the wood fencing. Dressed in cleanwhite linens and dusty brown sandals, he was your typical Jesus with long hippyhair and a feminine hand reaching out to the needy. Below his feet, Spanishwords invited me to get to know him better at a local church. But my eyes drewin on the bright golden oval around his head and the shimmering lightssilhouetting his body. Could Christians be right? Did halos really exist?Looking at the poster, I felt as if mystics and artists in the Christian lineagehad surreptitiously passed down this information, right under the noses ofviolent and dogmatic oligarchs, to assist people having experiences like mine.It’s as if they were saying, “You’re not crazy. Follow the bread-crumb trail,and you’ll find the secrets you’re looking for.”That night, I met Jade at Rena’s for dinner. Rena lived in a tiny, fifth-floor,high-rise apartment near Madison Square Park. Three quirky cats—atwenty-year-old calico, a psychotic Siamese, and a human-shy polydactyl withopposable thumbs—ruled the place. Rena sat cross-legged on a pillow in themiddle of the room watching them claw and bite each other. She preferred animalsto people, she said, because animals don’t talk. She had forbidden Jade to playwith the cats, since she squeezed them too hard.Rena wore a straw hat with Native American feathers pinned to the front, aMetallica T-shirt, and a pair of faded Levis. In the doorway to her bedroom hungthe pinstriped-suit skirt she had worn to the construction firm where she wasoffice manager. She had once dated the company’s president, who had covered thedown payment for her small, but prime-location apartment. Rena had her ways.A collection of spiky purple- and rose-colored crystals cluttered the woodenshelves and entertainment unit of her narrow living room. Rena handed me anorange polished stone the size of a quarter.“It’s a carnelian crystal,” she explained. “Put it on your second chakra. Yourenergy is off there. I think you already know that.” She pointed at my abdomenwhere the black bowling ball rolled in during panic attacks. “This will helpintegrate the two Jonnies you’re holding.”“Two Jonnies?” Jade asked, already squeezing the Siamese, who meowed and triedto escape.“Jonny America and the melancholy boy,” Rena explained.Rena cooked white-trash casserole—Tater Tots, canned green beans, and cream ofmushroom soup with lots of salt. “I love unhealthy, heavy food,” she said. “Justlike my cats.” We ate dinner on Epcot TV trays—both Jade and Rena loved anythingDisney. Jade put on Rena’s black Mickey Mouse ears for amusement while we ate.I asked Rena how she had come to New York. She told us about riding poniesaround the commune she grew up in outside San Francisco, but then leaving homeat sixteen to travel the Pacific Coast Highway with her boyfriend at the time.She waited tables and did odd jobs for gas money, eventually making it to LA,where she managed a recording studio that catered to hair metal acts likePoison, Guns n’ Roses, and Iron Maiden. She became addicted to coke with herboyfriend, and eventually escaped to New York to live a normal life as an officemanager.“Wow, Ren, you never talk about this stuff!” Jade squeezed the gray cottonwoodtattoo on Rena’s arm.“Why did you leave home at sixteen?” I asked.Rena narrowed her green Irish eyes in a glare that told me I was never tomention this again.“There was a tragedy,” she said.The clinking silverware exaggerated the silence in the room. Jade changed thesubject, asking Rena how her lunchtime spin class was going. After conversationsabout gym schedules, the Food Network, and Kevin Federline’s breakup withBritney Spears, I asked Rena how one could permanently see the colors of auras,noting that they had mostly faded for me since that night on MDMA.“I don’t talk about that stuff,” she said coldly.Jade and I walked to the L train after dinner, finding a seat in the corner. Shehad trouble bending down in her long puffy green coat, which I unkindly calledthe “sleeping bag,” as I found it unflattering.“Why did you ask her that question?” Jade shouted when the train pulled out.“And about the auras? Rena doesn’t want to talk about any of that. She justwants to be a regular person like everyone else!”“It’s not like I knew that!” I yelled back, receiving frowns from thestraphangers in the aisle.This was our pattern. Jade would explode over something I thought insignificant,and being delicado, I would argue that she treated me unfairly. It mimicked thedynamic I had with my mother.Jade and I took a breath. I stroked her cheek and kissed her forehead, “Sorryabout that.” The wrinkles in her brow relaxed, and Jade went on to explain howRena’s parents hadn’t known what to do with a kid who referred to house guestsas the “blue” or the “red” people, depending on the color of their auras. Renalearned to conceal her talents to avoid ridicule from family, colleagues, andfriends. Jade was one of the few people in her life who knew about her gift.“And what about the tragedy?” I asked.“Jonny,” she shook her head. “I have no idea.”Upon returning to my apartment, I asked Jade if she wanted to see what we coulddo with the energy. It had been a couple of days since the party, and we had yetto discuss what had happened. We closed the curtains to my bedroom and cuppedour fingers together to create balls of warm light in our hands. We made theballs larger or smaller simply by shifting our intention. Putting our fingertipstogether, we observed bluish trails linger in the air as we pulled away. Theeffect made it look as if we had long, luminous fingers, and Jade snickered thatwe would call this trick the “Wolverine.”We took off our clothes and glided our hands an inch above the other’s body,watching our skin dissolve into moving waves and buzzing particles. As webrought our hands to each other’s face, the energy hurried into a freneticJackson Pollock–like mosaic of zigzagging molecules. We looked ancient in thatmoment, like magical light beings beyond the limits of time, playing with theEtch-A-Sketch of the material plane—energy and spastic particles. I kept myfocus on Jade, building heat in my hands until I saw that it wasn’t skin orbones that held her together, but a vast invisible consciousness. I had readbefore that our world is composed of 99.99 percent space, but it’s one thing toread something like that in National Geographic and something else to encounterin bed with your girlfriend.“Do you see all this—the space, the buzzing particles? It’s too incredible!”“You look like an old gnome with all those moving wrinkles on your face,” Jade’scartoon-mouse eyes widened with a giggle. She still had specks of pink glitterdotting her cheeks from the day.“Don’t you know the implications of this?” I said. “The universe is completelydifferent than we thought!”“I think you’re making a big deal out of nothing,” she said. “It’s just energy.”Jade set the alarm clock on the nightstand and then shuffled under the covers. Irealized I still hadn’t told her about losing my job. When I gave her a foreheadkiss, she giggled at my particalized face. “Goodnight, my sweet gnome,” shelaughed. “Goodnight.”"},{"pageContent":"[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_009_r1.jpg]CLIMBING THE TREE OF LIFE[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_L02_r1.jpg]NEWLY UNEMPLOYED, I HAD TIME to research Rena’s spiritual energy and how itrelated to the Jesus poster I had seen in Alphabet City. I raided Gabe’sbookshelf while he was at his clinic, pushing aside the Rolfing, Reiki energy,and quantum healing guides, with their new-age indigo covers of lotus flowersand multicolored mandalas, to explore more tempered books by Columbia Universitytheoretical physicist Brian Greene. In The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time,and the Texture of Reality and The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, HiddenDimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory, the charming Rhodes Scholarargued that tiny vibrating strings of energy were the basis of all matter andphysical manifestations in the universe. Trees, dogs, and office furnitureoscillate at different frequencies, giving each its unique bodily form.According to string theory, every being in existence is its own musicalinstrument, playing varying notes and octaves in an interconnected, energeticsymphony. The physics for this phenomenon require at least ten or elevendimensions in the cosmos, most of which we’ve never seen. As convoluted as thissounded, my skeptical mind found some comfort in discovering a scientificexplanation for what I was now seeing.Researching across the web, I discovered that numerous cultures and religionshad perceived this all-encompassing energy long before string theory’s complexequations were formulated. In the Rig Veda, the earliest Hindu text (writtenabout 1500 BC), prana is revered as the vital life force or “breath” thatsustains the cosmos. The ancient practices of tai chi, qigong, kung fu, andother martial arts were developed to harness and move chi (“energy flow,”“vapor,” or “air”) for one’s well-being and advantage. Polynesians called thismysterious energy mana; Egyptians, ka; the Aborigines of Australia, miwi; andthe Hebrews, ruah, meaning “breath of life.” To my surprise, I found thatinitiates in the early Christian mystery schools (scholars now label many ofthese as “Gnostic”) spoke of the Greek term pneuma, meaning “breath,” “wind,” or“spirit.” Members called the higher initiates “pneumatics,” as they were full ofthis spiritual energy. Although I had never encountered anything close to theseexperiences at Methodist Sunday school, I considered the possibility that theseearly mystics had developed their own psycho-spiritual technologies to accessthe underlying power of the universe that string theory now postulated.In the Christian tradition, the study of the Holy Spirit, called pneumatology,examines the phenomena of this omnipresent, vivifying power. In the Gospel ofJohn, Jesus delivers the Holy Spirit to his disciples after his resurrection:“And at this he breathed over them and says, “Here’s some holy spirit. Take it.If you forgive anyone their sins, they are forgiven; if you do not release themfrom their sins, the are not released.” (20:22–23) In this scene, we witness aspiritual master transmitting higher frequencies to his initiates, through whichthey receive the power to forgive, heal, and release others from the energeticbonds of karma. Throughout the gospels, we find Jesus healing with his hands, ina manner similar to Gabe’s Reiki energy books, harnessing pneuma to cure illnessand disease. Mark 5:25–30 recounts a healing in which Jesus does not even usehis hands. A woman who “had suffered for twelve years with constant bleeding”comes up behind Jesus in a crowd and touches his robe, causing “the healingpower to [go] out from him” and immediately stopping her bleeding.2[Phil_9781583943434_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts002]The Christian rite of baptism likely involved pneumatic transmission. The wordinitiates used for water during baptism is translated as “moving water,” as in ariver or stream, which was a common metaphor to describe currents of energy.Jesus baptizes with “holy spirit and fire,” indicating spiritual energy.Numerous paintings of his baptism depict a shimmering light descending into hisscalp, filling him with divine power. In the once lost Gospel of Thomas, one ofthe Gnostic gospels, Jesus tells the eponymous disciple that he is no longer astudent but an equal, “Because you have become intoxicated by the bubblingspring that I have tended.” (Verse 13) Thomas may have reached this enlightenedstate by “drinking” (receiving) the higher vibrations of Jesus, similar to howmy consciousness lifted when soaking up Rena’s “electric” frequencies.According to yogic philosophy, a person absorbs and processes prana throughseven primary psychic centers called chakras (Sanskrit for “wheels” or “disks”)that receive, assimilate, and transmit energy throughout the auric field. Thechakras are aligned from the crown of the head down the spine to the perineum,each pulling in life-sustaining power through a spiral or vortex motion. Theindividual chakras vibrate at specific frequencies and correspond to differentlevels of human consciousness, developmental stages of life, colors, elements,sounds, psychological aspects, and bodily functions. Our thought and beliefsystems affect how the chakras function and the types of energies they canreceive.Early Christians seemed to know about these seven sacred centers in the holytemple of the body. They talked of seventh heaven, seven sacraments, sevenseals, seven virtues, and seven deadly sins (when our energy centers are out ofbalance, our shadow side arises). In a letter by Clement of Alexandriadiscussing the Secret Gospel of Mark, the second-century church leader revealedthat “the innermost sanctuary of truth” is “hidden by seven veils,”3[Phil_9781583943434_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts003] which may signify the sevenchakras and how they lock us into worldly illusion, spinning the wheels ofsamsara, the cycle of rebirth and suffering.One of the more obvious Christian references to the seven psychic centers comesfrom the book of Revelation: “As for the mystery of the seven stars which yousaw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: the seven stars are theangels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.”(1:20) In alchemical literature and paintings, writers and artists featurelights and lamps in the same positions as the chakras on the body. Thisdescription of the seven lampstands during the apocalypse (a word meaning“revealing”) suggests the incredible transformative potential of these sevensacred centers.The chakras power the human energy field. Apparently each individual psychiccenter relates to a different layer of the aura, creating the spectrum of colorsthat Jade and I had seen on MDMA.Across the centuries, painters depicted images of the Buddha, Shiva, Shakti,Krishna, Jesus, and Mother Mary with these shimmering globes enveloping theirheads and lights surrounding their bodies. In the Christian text The Hymn of thePearl, which is part of the Acts of Thomas, the protagonist returns to his“Father’s kingdom,” clothed in a “robe with glorious colors” and a “toga ofbrilliant hues.”4 [Phil_9781583943434_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts004] Similarly, inthe Old Testament, Joseph, who was known for his clairvoyance, wore a “coat ofmany colors.”A complex network of branching pathways, called meridians (nadis in Sanskrit),enables energy to flow throughout the human body. Shaped in a circuit-boardpattern, these channels pass pranic pulses of data to the chakra disk drives,which process and spin the energy out to the rest of the system. I could see whyRena called pneuma “spiritual electricity.” But this energy doesn’t chargeclunky refrigerators; it powers the intricate motherboard of the human form.Today NYU scientists measure human electromagnetic fields invisible to the humaneye with SQUIDS, superconducting quantum interference devices.Yogis call the human energy system the “Tree of Life,” with the upper meridiansreaching like branches to the sky, the lower ones toward the earth. The mysticsof the Far East used the same symbolism that appears in the story of the Gardenof Eden in the West. As I scrolled down web page after web page, I came torealize an astounding possibility: that the tree I was looking for doesn’t liedormant in musty texts, but flows with energy within each of us.The Tree of Life appeared in numerous societies across the globe. The Assyriansrevered a tree formed by lines crossing a series of nodes, mimicking the body’scomplicated electrical system. Armenians carved it on their warriors’ armor,dividing the branches equally on the right and left sides as a representation ofbalance. The Kabbalah’s Tree of Life has an arrangement of ten (sometimeseleven) psychic spheres, called Sephirot, which when envisioned on the humanbody closely resembles the yogic chakra model. The alchemists of the Renaissancedepicted Trees of Life with seven spheres, stars, suns, flowers, and othermystical icons, looking like the chakras along the spine. And it was under theBodhi tree that the Buddha first awakened to his own enlightened nature.Even the modern day Christmas tree can be understood as a representation of theTree of Life. Its origins stretch back to the classic Syrians and Greeks whodecorated evergreens in honor of the crucified god Attis. In the heart ofwinter, the evergreen, with its needles still full and lush, symbolizes rebirthand immortality. The Romans adopted and updated this tradition with their winterSaturnalia, which the Christians later adopted and renamed Christmas.In Acts 5:30,10:39, and 13:29, the Romans hang Jesus on a tree (the Greek wordxylon), not a cross. In his book The Power of Myth, Joseph Campbell explains,“The Garden is the place of unity, of nonduality of male and female, good andevil, God and human beings.… Jesus on the cross is on a tree, the tree ofimmortal life, and he is the fruit of the tree.”5[Phil_9781583943434_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts005] According to Campbell, the crossrepresents the Tree of Life in the original garden and the crucifixion redeemsus from the “original sin” of Adam and Eve’s separation from God and nature.Jesus transcends the illusion of duality by balancing cosmic polarities withinhis energy body to reconnect with the Oneness of the universe. He has masteredthe various pneumatic forces and electric pulses of human existence, bringingdivinity into man, and merging heaven and earth.In many traditions, the Tree of Life expanded out beyond individuals toencompass the universe. The Scandinavians believed in Yggdrasil, a massive WorldTree of Life that connected our “middle earth” with the underworld and theheavens. World-bridging trees were prevalent across Mesoamerican societies,including among the Izapans, the Olmecs, and the Aztecs. The Mayans worshipedthe ceiba tree, which served as a multilevel symbol for the central axis ofMother Earth, as well as the glowing band of our Milky Way.Reading about the World Tree of Life, I thought about how the nerves and veinsin my own body match the branching fractal patterns in the veins of leaves, thelimbs of trees, and the river networks across the five continents. The Earth hasher own electromagnetic system with a complex grid of large-scale energychannels called “ley lines” throughout her planetary circuitry. A luminous aurastretches across the sky with the colorful flashes of the aurora borealis upnorth and the aurora australis down under. The magnetic North Pole serves as hercrown chakra and the South Pole as her root, which processes universal energy,nurturing life across her blue and green surface.Maybe we are no different from the rest of the globe—or the entire cosmos—livingin the branches of an energetic web spanning the space–time continuum. As withthe mythical Adam and Eve, we humans might be able to access the power of adivine tree to usher in a new era on our planet. But this time around, thewisdom will not be about separation and self-awareness, but rather life,rebirth, and connectedness within our universal family tree."},{"pageContent":"[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_010_r1.jpg]THE PHILLIPS LEGACY[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_L02_r1.jpg]MY EARLIEST MEMORIES OF JESUS are from a small Methodist church in the Rockiesthirty miles west of Denver. My mother would spit on tissues and rub our facesclean as my older brother, younger sister, and I crawled into the glossy woodenpews. We hated church and sloppily threw on our Sunday best—matching navy-bluesuits and clip-on ties for my brother and I and an angelic white dress for mysister. My mother had picked out all our clothes, hoping we would represent thePhillips household properly.She spent an hour each morning Aquanetting her frosted hair into an old lady’safro—although she was only in her late thirties—repainting her cherry-red Leepress-on nails, and rearranging the multiple fake-gold rings on her fingers sothey would hide the skin underneath that was turning green. Even with theseartificial flourishes, she was a natural beauty, boasting model-worthycheekbones and an attractively young face. Her skin was incredibly smooth,almost glowing, and she turned heads every time she sashayed her petite frameacross a room in high heels. Fashion-conscious but also somewhat poor, my motherhad filled every closet in the house with her thrift-store clothes so shewouldn’t repeat outfits during the school year (she was a middle-school historyteacher). Each of us kids had to sacrifice half our closet for her second-handskirts, shawls, and blouses. As far as I know, she never wore the same dresstwice to church.Throughout the service, sleepy organ music conducted us to rise and sit and riseagain. A true Method-ist, our silver-haired minister stuck to the regimentedprogram, his jowls undulating above a threadbare gray suit (salaries must havebeen low), as he droned on about long-dead characters I didn’t care about. At8,500 feet in altitude, the winters in the steep foothills dragged on. Mysiblings and I shivered in the pews and dreamed of putting on our ski clothesand sledding down the mountains around Elk Meadow outside the stained glasswindows. Church was like homework—something we endured to keep our mom happy.Afterward, she rewarded (or bribed) us with Dairy Queen Blizzards that moved mysoul more than any liturgy ever did.When I was ten, a Houston family, the Lawsons, moved to Old Squaw Pass, ourevergreen-covered mountain neighborhood on the outskirts of Clear Creek County.With them came a new faith. Consisting of two grandparents and an anxiousnine-year-old grandson, Matt, who was my age, the family had fled Texas,abandoning Matt’s mother, who had recently been indicted for heroin possession.Frail but severe, the seventy-year-old grandpa ordered Matt to carry out animpossible number of chores, often bringing out “the belt” when Matt didn’tcomplete them on time. Matt called his grandpa “sir.”His grandpa would take away our black Atari 2600 joysticks and force us to watchevangelical videos about the impending Rapture. The videos showed more gore thanthe slasher movies my mother forbade me to watch. They featured grotesqueintercontinental wars and plagues, the moon turning into hot blood, and anAnti-Christ bogeyman torturing and beheading innocent Christians. In the end,God and Jesus executed a global bloodbath, sending most of humanity into ascreaming fire. After the final credits rolled up, his grandpa would shout atme, “Do you repent, Jon, for all your sins?” Scared, I would tell him, “Yes, Irepent,” though I didn’t know what that exactly meant.The violent images of the Rapture replayed in my dreams. Jesus stood on amountain of broken, tortured bodies, victoriously holding a sword above his headwhile surveying the bombed gray landscape around him. Every morning I woke upfearing the coming slaughter of the Tribulation. Then after months ofnightmares, I knew I had to make a choice: I could either fret about theapocalypse or enjoy being young and living in the mountains. I stopped going tothe Lawsons’ house.For the kids who were my age on Old Squaw Pass, I became the leader, instigatingdaring escapades of trash-can golf, flashlight night-sledding, stick wars,trespassing hikes, capture the flag, tree whip-flash, butt-boarding, tire tag,Rambo in the dark, trampoline toss, mountainside rock rolling, roof-hopping atthe nearby ghost town, and stringing cans to stop cars in the road. These stuntsexhilarated me, and I plotted more and more of them. Summer proved the best timeof year, with the good weather and longer days allowing for more adventures. Butmy mood would darken when the mosquitoes came out in the evening and thefluorescent green street lamp clicked on at our bus-stop hangout.Then I would walk up the mountainside, past the small herd of elk coming out oftheir hiding spots after dusk, past the eleven muscle cars in our driveway—onlytwo or three of which ever worked (the rest were used for parts)—to theweathered two-story wooden house overlooking the lights of Denver way down onthe high plains. This place had once been fun, back when my dad served as headaccountant at the US West phone company. We had money then, and we wentsnowshoeing at Steamboat Springs, took trips to the train at Cripple Creek, andpanned for gold in the South Platte River.But shady dealings went on in US West’s accounting department, something myfather never felt comfortable talking about afterward. He resigned from his job.Losing confidence, he didn’t leave bed for nearly a year. “Stop lollygagging!”my mom yelled at him, understandably concerned about raising three children on apublic schoolteacher’s salary. When he finally started looking for work again,my dad found that the Reagan recession had nearly bankrupted the CentennialState and the only work he could get was as a part-time accountant at a hospitalfour hours away in the smelly agricultural town of Sterling.My dad had grown up a farm boy in Linn County, the poorest region of Missouri.His father, Phillips Senior, was known to be the biggest bastard in the county.A violent, imposing man, Senior battled his wife and four children until theyall eventually left him. In one legendary exploit, he dumped rattlesnakes on hislawn so that townies wouldn’t pay him surprise visits. When my dad met my mom atthe age of thirteen, he had already decided to rescue her from the Show MeState. After completing MU’s business school, he was drafted and served atwo-year tour in Germany. Upon returning, he whisked my mom off to some of thebest elk-hunting country in the West—Colorado.Unfortunately for us, the turbulent childhood my dad had escaped was sometimesresurrected at home during his absence. The pressure of holding down amiddle-school teaching job, grading homework, doing all the errands, payingbills, and parenting three children proved too much for my mother. She generallyhad a boisterous, joking personality that would ingratiate entire crowds atparties with her loud, powerful laughter. But she found herself facing thehardships of a single mother while still being married, which couldn’t have beeneasy. If we cleaned a dish sloppily or left the back door unlocked, her teethwould clench and a strange, cruel gaze would slip over her once-kind hazel eyes,making her almost unrecognizable to me. As if possessed by a shadowy entity, shewould storm through the house, banging cabinets and shouting, “You children areworthless!” On the worst days, she would scream, “I wish you were never born!”not seeming to realize what she was saying. Eventually she would calm down overa simmering pot of beef stew or a chicken casserole, sobbing that she loved us,but she couldn’t always handle the burden of our circumstances.Occasionally she threatened to divorce our father or abandon us if we didn’tshape up. Once she did run away, after my brother and I shattered a downstairswindow with a football. We nervously clung to the slats of the outside deck forhours until she finally strolled back with a shirt-full of chokecherries thatshe boiled into purple jelly. She sang nursery rhymes to us, stroking our hair,while we shoved pieces of jelly-soaked Wonder Bread into our mouths. In manyways, we appreciated these moments more than most kids did, knowing theywouldn’t last.My brother, who was nearly three years my senior, took on the responsibilitiesof our often-absent father. Resentful of having to be so accountable, my brothermirrored some of my mother’s anger. While he was watching us one afternoon, mysister and I refused to follow his orders to vacuum the living room, so he tiedmy sister and me up in sleeping bags and threw us down the stairs. My youngersister avoided the emotional storms that swept through the house by withdrawinginto the cocoon of her imagination, talking to elf princesses, pink and orangeCare Bears, and her best friend, “the Fairy Queen.” I hid in my basementbedroom, throwing my blue fleece blanket over my neck like a superhero’s cape,pretending to fly away from home. Sometimes I would fall on the ground in apounding temper tantrum, as if possessed by my mother’s frustration. She scoldedme for my “hissy fits,” so I learned to trap those emotions inside. That’s whenthe bowling-ball pain and panic attacks in my stomach began. As I grew older, Ilearned to channel my anger into humor, which I could safely lob over mymother’s head—at least that’s what I told myself. I felt my mission was to bringlaughter into this frightening world, although sometimes my jokes had a morebiting tone than I liked to admit.Unlike most of my peers, I loved school. It was always safe there. Coming from ahome where much of what I did wasn’t good enough, I soon learned that as long asI completed my homework and studied, teachers would treat me kindly and give meA’s. Athletic, with an alpha-male attitude, my brother broke every rushingrecord in our school’s football history, served as senior-class president, andearned the homecoming-king crown. As an admiring younger brother, I followed inhis footsteps, becoming student-senate president, point guard on the basketballteam, prom king, and part of the school’s first cross-country state-championshipteam. I hoped that these achievements would convince my mother that I was worthyof her love. I still couldn’t shake the rumbling insecurities building inside mybelly, and every few months searing panic attacks shot through my nervoussystem. When they came, I would pretend to have the flu so that I wouldn’t haveto leave my bedroom.My mother taught her middle-school classes in the same building that our highschool was in. While often criticizing us at home, she boasted publicly abouther sons’ achievements as if they were her own. Admittedly, I enjoyed hearingher speak proudly of me in front of other teachers, but I also wished she couldhave given the same type of praise and affection in private. It didn’t take longfor the Phillips clan to become an ideal for the school to live up to, the modelAmerican family. To my mother’s chagrin, my sister tainted this illusion ofperfection, earning low grades and smoking with grungy heavy-metal kids in theschool parking lot.On graduation day, I stood in front of five hundred people in our high schoolauditorium with my eighty-five classmates seated behind me in blue robes. Ipretended to search my pockets anxiously for my lost valedictorian speech. Mymother’s cheeks fumed red in the front row as she gripped my brother’s wrist.(As usual, my father was away working.) Then I snapped my fingers as thoughremembering that I had stored my notes in my flat-topped graduation hat. Mymother laughed, elbowing the district superintendent sitting next to her,reminding the young professional in his designer suit what a clever boy she hadraised.I stuttered at the microphone, nervous, but also aware of how my educationalprocess had been a sham. Here I was about to graduate with Clear Creek’s highesthonor, and yet I had no idea who I was or what I was doing. The system I hadcompleted with such distinction had failed to mold me into a young man with anyconfidence or future direction. Unsure where to go next, I had signed on to dowhat everyone else did—spend four more years in academia.Although only ninety minutes from home, the University of Colorado at Bouldermight as well have been on the other side of the country, considering how seldomI drove home. I needed to distance myself from my small mining town. Besides, Ihad an entire campus to explore with twenty-seven thousand students who knewnothing about the Phillips legacy at Clear Creek. My prankster came out in fullforce, engaging in the standard dorm antics. My greatest moment came when Ihappened upon the window of two baseball-capped friends in their dorm room. Theyjokingly bowed to green Christmas lights that they had strung into amarijuana-leaf shape on their wall. Stoned, they laughed and prayed to the“Great pot god.” That’s when I growled into their open window, hiding just outof site, “THANK YOU, MY YOUNG DISCIPLES. YOU HAVE SERVED ME WELL, AND I AMPROUD!” For the next four years, they thought God had spoken to them while theywere high.During the first day of my freshmen human geography course, among the fourhundred students in the tiered lecture hall, I happened to sit next to a shy butsexy black-haired, black-skirted goth girl named Amanda. I helped her study forthe tests, and after she received her first B+, she gave me a kiss. Thanks to mymother, I had been terrified of girls. Over the next two semesters, Amandagently helped me feel safe enough to explore sex in the ripped backseat of my1984 Datsun 310.Then I found my second love—literature and creative writing. Thestraight-talking adventurers of Hemingway, Kerouac, Bukowski, Ginsberg, Nin,Miller, and the underappreciated Colorado author John Fante seduced me with wildtales of the literary underground. Unlike my Methodist minister orfundamentalist neighbors, these guys crashed through the guardrails of themundane in pursuit of the transcendent. For me, books were better than religion,and I read them avariciously.Not wanting to be like my father, who had been with only one woman his entirelife, I broke up with Amanda after graduation. I followed my literary rolemodels into the urban underbelly, setting off for the red warehouses andcrumbling Victorian buildings of downtown Denver. For ninety dollars a month, ahigh school friend, who had gained notoriety as a washtub bass player in one ofthe city’s only jug bands, let me sleep on his couch in a carriage house offGrant Street. Broke and lonely, we listened to Bob Dylan and Tom Waits late atnight with a sense of romantic urgency. We drank three-dollar Rolling Rockswhile discussing the Beats at their former haunt, My Brother’s Bar, along theSouth Platte River. In the hallway to the bathroom, the staff had pinned up aletter sent by Neal Cassady asking his friend Justin to pay his bar tab.I found a job as a barista at St. Mark’s Coffee House, the hippest and dirtiestcafé near Larimer Square. Slinging espresso there had the same cred as being ina band. I rarely paid for drinks at bars and got invited to clandestine artparties, where disheveled hipsters in trucker hats and thick-rimmed glassesscoffed at the mediocre paintings they came to see. I met so many girls throughmy job that my coworkers started calling me “Sammy” after Ted Danson’sphilandering character on Cheers. I drank whiskey on ice, wrote stories into theearly morning, and got laid as often as my literary heroes had, but I foundmyself staring at the empty bottles, Trojan wrappers, and grimy ashtrays aroundmy couch-bed, thinking suicide might not be the worst option if this was allthat existence had to offer."},{"pageContent":"[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_011_r1.jpg]THE BAMBINO DI PRAGA[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_L02_r1.jpg]AFTER TWO YEARS AT ST. MARK’S, I had finally saved enough money to move toPrague. In the late nineties, forty thousand Americans caroused under its sootymedieval spires, imbibing absinthe in cavernous stone drinking holes andenjoying the fruits of a fledgling democracy while dreaming of writing the nextgreat expat novel. I decided to join them. I’d had enough of Denver’s narrowprovincialism. I found a job teaching English as a second language at a Czechhigh school to pay my rent. I was kind of slumming it, but it tasted likeliberation. At night, I took notes on my friends’ adventures dating mafia bossesin the pico (Czech meth) trade, puking slivovice over the famed Charles Bridgewith Hungarian princesses, brawling with former StB agents (the secret police)in Old Town Square, and plying their American passports to sleep with impossiblyattractive Slavic women. I began to write a book about the Left Bank of theVltava, hoping to make it a Sun Also Rises meets Generation X. But the greatPrague novel never did surface from our community, perhaps because we were toolost in our own desperate hedonism.Frequenting the open mike at the Globe Bookstore, I met a soft-spoken woman fromFlorida named Lynn, who ran her own poetry school in the city. She had a palepixie face and red hair that streamed to her waist. She moved like a river,flowing and graceful, and I joked that the reason she dumped thick layers ofsalt on her food, including toast, was to balance all the water in her system. Iwas twenty-four at the time, and the feminine wisdom of this woman in her earlythirties excited me. We had a natural flirtation that I never thought would goanywhere, given our age difference, but a bottle of Frankovka after one of herreadings dissolved that gap.Lynn and I spent the next few months in ecstasy. She was water in every way andwould drench the bed with multiple orgasms. One day, after a round on her floormattress, she frowned and said she had to tell me about a miracle that hadhappened to her mother—one that would affect our relationship.A year before, Lynn left Prague for Buffalo, New York to visit her mother, whohad undergone a double mastectomy and was dying of breast cancer. In thehospital waiting room, Lynn met a man who had made regular trips to the Czechcapital. He told her he loved the city because of the church with the statue ofthe Bambino di Praga, the infant baby Jesus of Prague, who was said to granthealings. On her drive home, Lynn got lost and stopped at the office of aCatholic church to ask for directions. Above the mantle in the office stood areplica of the Infant of Prague, who in fact looked more like a toddler, adornedin his gold crown and holding a cross half his height in his left hand. Thereceptionist told Lynn that if she wrote a wish on a piece of paper and threw itin the fire, what she desired would come true. Lynn wrote down her request,tossed it into the flames, and left.Later that summer, while Lynn was dating a poet named Todd, her mom called fromthe hospital to say that her doctors couldn’t believe it, but the cancer wascompletely gone and the tests couldn’t be wrong. Todd and Lynn felt that theywere witnesses to a miracle. To mark the event, he promised to visit her inPrague a year from that day.“Lynn, you don’t really think a baby Jesus statue saved your mom from cancer?” Istarted to roll my eyes, but caught myself, realizing that I needed to treadwith care around this topic. Besides, I had something bigger to worry about.“Todd’s not still coming out here, is he?” I asked.Lynn turned away from me while nodding yes. “I owe it to the universe to takecare of him like he took care of me,” she said.And so Todd came to Prague. He was young like me, an effeminate poet withdyed-purple hair and dangling silver earrings. The black bowling ball camecrashing down into my life after that. I barely left my bed over the next twomonths except for work.Not having Lynn around, I was able to see something I had avoided accepting fora long time: I was ill. For the previous year, the glands in my throat hadswollen horribly. I couldn’t swallow without intense, stinging pain. I had toturn most of my English classes into writing lessons so I wouldn’t have to talk.I went to a dozen doctors, but none could help. Testing blood and saliva, theyfound nothing wrong. The sickness was in my head, they suggested, not my throat.I became hopeless, watching the world through a tiny window—and everyone elsewas having fun. I accustomed myself to the life of an invalid, sleeping longhours, watching Wild West movies for entertainment, sinking into endlessdepression.Lynn kept leaving messages on my answering machine, but I refused to see her.Then, one day, I ran into a friend who worked for the antiquated media outletRadio Free Europe, which had lost its audience since the end of the Cold War.She was a sober and humorless investigative reporter who specialized in humanrights issues in Kosovo, so I was surprised when she shared that she had been toa psychic. The woman had correctly named members of my friend’s family, her bestfriends, and her job. “I think I bumped into you because you’re supposed to seeher. Maybe she can help cure your throat.”“Sure,” I laughed. “Maybe I can call in the Ghostbusters while I’m at it.”A few days later, my glands hurt so badly, even after a full cup of chamomiletea, that I reluctantly called the psychic. Sheri and I met at Café Slavia withits riverside view of Prague Castle. Her appearance didn’t inspire confidence. Ashort, stout, middle-aged Australian woman with a large trollish nose and plumpruby cheeks, Sheri was swathed in old scarves like a vagabond. I paid for ourTurkish coffees. As the small black grounds circled our cups, she successfullyreeled off the names of my parents and siblings, good friends, and firstgirlfriend. I crunched up my forehead, trying to make sense of it. Of course, Iwas paying Sheri to give me these answers, but I never expected that it wouldwork. I could imagine how she might discover details about my family on theInternet, but not about my college roommate or Amanda. Was this even possible?Sheri went on to note that I loved literature and thought I was a novelist, butshe had news for me. “You think we’re meeting because of your throat, but that’snot why. The illness is there to help you find your career path. You’re notgoing to like this, so get comfortable.” She waited for me to set down my drink.She lifted her enormous chin. There was something arrogant, something powerfuland mysterious in her troll-like confidence that unnerved and angered me. “Yourcareer path—it’s not the novel writing,” she said slowly. Her words hit me likean invisible grenade.“What do you know?” I hissed back defensively.“Honey, I know it’s hard to hear, but you’re supposed to be an organizer and apublic speaker. That’s who you are.”“I can’t even do job interviews without getting panic attacks. How am I supposedto speak in public?” I set down her 300-crown fee on the table. “You’re wronglady. You don’t know me.” I picked up my shoulder bag and walked toward to thedoor.“Honey, there’s one more thing,” she yelled after me. “You know that hurricanethat just passed through your life? If you want to heal that throat, you’regoing to have to give her a call.”For the next month, I kept thinking about Sheri rattling off the names ofAmanda, my high school buddy Max, and college roommate Steve. Of course, she hadbeen wrong about my career path, but what if she did know something about Lynnand my throat? It was difficult to believe all this hocus-pocus, but pain is apowerful motivator and I eventually set aside my pride and gave Lynn a call.Apparently Todd had left town, and she was now dating an older Austrian chemicalengineer whom she thought she might marry. It hurt to hear that. I had lost herto Todd, and they hadn’t even stayed together. Lynn told me she had startedlearning esoteric kinesiology, a healing modality that used some type of muscletesting to diagnose illness. She wanted me to come by so she could try thetechnique on my throat. It sounded like more spiritual flakiness, the kind thathad already left me depressed and alone.I knocked on the door of her fifth-story apartment above the Národní třída tramstop, listening to the bells from the street, a broken man who had lost his lastpebble of dignity. Lynn brought me into her room, sat on her knees, and began topush my wrists back and forth, asking “yes” or “no” questions to them. I keptturning to the mattress, where we had enjoyed so many nights together, seeing itas a relic of some lost memory buried by time. Lynn claimed that my muscles gaveher good answers, and after about twenty minutes, she said that it looked asthough my dad had moved away from our family when I was eight or nine. I wassurprised, as I had never told her about my father moving to Sterling for work.Talking over the tram dings below, Lynn asked me to re-imagine that moment, butthis time with a different, positive outcome. I closed my eyes and saw my fatherfinding his confidence and hunting down a well-paying job at the Tech Centersouth of downtown. He whisked my giggling mother up the stairs, relieving theterror of the house.Lynn muscle-tested more about what I should do next to complete the treatment.“Doctor Rycholvsky,” she said. “He has your cure. The wrists don’t lie.”Rycholvsky was a homeopath, which I took to mean witchdoctor, but after seeingso many MDs who were not able to help me, I figured it wouldn’t hurt to try atleast one quack. He had moussed black hair, a cold, expressionless face, andwore a white lab coat in an office that looked perfect for your standard 1950family practitioner. “I used to be a doctor,” he told me with only a slightCzech accent. “I left the profession because I wanted to heal people.” He askeddozens of questions about my childhood, my aspirations, and even what I dreamedabout at night.“Sadness,” he said after examining my throat, eyes, and ears. “That’s yourdiagnosis. You have so much sadness, Jonathan, and it’s affecting your throat. Ithink you’re not expressing yourself the best way.”“But I write every day.”“Maybe you’re supposed to express yourself differently. Are there other thingsthat make you happy?”“I’m a novelist,” I said, getting angry. “That’s who I am! That’s what I do!”Dr. Rycholvsky reached for a small container on a shelf, pulled out a tiny whitepill, and had me place it under my tongue until it dissolved. “It’s a traceamount of sulfur,” he told me. “It will tell the energy where to work.” If Iremembered correctly, sulfur is what medieval doctors used just before bleedingand leeching their patients to death. I almost spit out the pill. Rycholvskystared at me for several minutes and then asked if I felt any different. I toldhim my mouth was moister.“That’s it!” He hit the desk with his hand. “We have the cure. Now pay me 400crowns and call me in two weeks.”“Here are your 400 crowns!” I yelled, throwing the bills at him. “I’m out ofhere.”I marched back to my apartment, hollering to a nonexistent God that I wasthrough with Lynn and her infant baby Jesus, body kinesiology, and boyfriendswho weren’t me. It was time to get real. I had to be straight with myself. I wasan ill person; I always would be. There were no such things as miracles.After teaching school the next day, I was riding up the steep Náměstí Míruescalator, said to be the longest escalator in Europe, when an unexplainedsadness overcame me. I collapsed onto my knees on the metal steps, sobbing inwaves, as a black heaviness lifted from my chest. I cried periodicallythroughout the night. When I woke up the next morning, the irritation in mythroat had disappeared, and the glands had receded to their normal size. Icouldn’t believe it: I was healthy again, and my attitude toward the worldinstantly became sunnier. But I knew there had to be a medical explanation.Perhaps homeopathy really was its own scientific field, and these practitionershad researched potentials that other Western doctors had yet to understand. Irang up Lynn, thanking her for recommending Rycholvsky, although still notbelieving that muscle testing had anything to do with my cure. Then, tooembarrassed to speak with him directly, I wrote Rycholvsky a letter of apology,telling him of my new respect for his profession.After my throat healed and I started going out again, I grew tired of the expatdebauchery and didn’t renew my contract at the high school. I had a friendliving in Santiago de Compostela, and I set out to relive Hemingway’s stories ofseñoritas, bulls, and flamenco. Only after I got there did I learn that Santiagode Compostela is the Ireland of Spain. Rain pounds the town’s narrow, medievalgranite streets for nine months of the year while the sound of the gaita(Spanish bagpipes) wafts through the mist.Every summer, thousands of peregrinos embark on the Camino de Santiago, apilgrimage that can cover hundreds of miles to the giant, mossy cathedral in thecenter of Old Town. I edited my novel in a nearby café, grinning at travelerswho limped through the Romanesque sculptures of the cathedral’s Pórtico de laGloria, suffering from sunburn and dehydration. I may have been healed by analternative medical modality but that was no reason to believe in a nonexistenthigher power. Didn’t these journeyers know that God was dead and all they wouldfind inside their destination were withered priests sprinkling frankincense?One day in late summer, while walking to a private English class in the ugly,glass, Franco-built New Town, I received a call from my student Ramón.“They’s attacked, man! They hit the fucking towers, and they falled down. They’sattacked your country!”“What are you talking about?”“They’s attacked America. Go watch TV and see what I talk about.”I walked into a Galician dive bar, where drunk, pot-bellied men shouted around alittle black-and-white TV. In that thirteen-inch box, the world as I knew ittumbled down along with the towers on the screen. I tucked my jaw into my handsand did what most everyone did that day: I watched that damn video loop over andover and over again. Maybe it was my pallid cheeks or the panic across my face,but in that bar it felt as if “American” was tattooed across my forehead. Menstumbled to my table and elbowed me with laughter. They pointed at the twofallen towers.“Fidel Castro! Fidel Castro!” they yelled gleefully, as if the Cuban dictatorwas responsible.What was I doing here? I had been away for three years—two in Prague and one inSpain. I was sick of Europe, tired of the gray weather and the tacky, bubble-gumpop music. I wanted to hear electric guitar solos, eat a decent hamburger, andhang out with people who wouldn’t take pleasure in the destruction of the TwinTowers. So I returned to Denver, sleeping on a friend’s couch while consideringmy next move. When that friend set out for New York to launch his career as apainter, I joined him on the trip, eventually finding work at The September 11thFund."},{"pageContent":"[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_012_r1.jpg]GNOSIS: THE NOT-SO-SECRET HISTORY OF JESUS[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_L02_r1.jpg]IN DECEMBER 1945, during the tail end of the most devastating war in humanhistory, a peasant named Mohammed ’Ali of the al-Samman clan stumbled upon anearthenware jar near limestone caves in the deserts of Upper Egypt. He fearedthat an evil jinn (demon or genie) resided inside, but hoping for lost riches,he opened the jar. To his disappointment, twelve ragged leather-bound codicesfell onto the ground. He didn’t realize these twelve hundred weathered pagescontained a priceless treasure: dozens of lost Christian gospels that had beenhidden away for sixteen hundred years. Mohammed carried them home to his mother,who kept warm at night by feeding pages of what we now call the Nag HammadiLibrary to her fireplace.These fifty-two texts—with titles such as The Gospel of Thomas, Secret James,The Gospel of Mary, On the Origin of the World, The Gospel of Philip, SecretJohn, and The Sophia of Jesus—showed that first- through fourth-centuryChristianity was much more varied than previously thought, composed of diversesects claiming secret knowledge of heavenly realms. Modern scholars now labelthese texts as “Gnostic,” since they lay out an initiatory process forcandidates to overcome the forgetfulness, drunkenness, blindness, and sleep ofthe illusory world in order to access gnosis, direct experience or personalrevelation of a divine reality.The Nag Hammadi Library supported the popular theory that Christianity stemmedfrom the ancient mystery-school traditions of the Mediterranean, which featureddying and resurrecting godmen. In Egypt, the faithful worshiped Horus; inGreece, Dionysus; in Syria, Adonis; in Asia Minor, Attis; in Persia and laterRome, Mithras; and in Israel, Jesus (historically the most recent). Thesimilarities among these hierophants were uncanny. According to legend, severalwere born on December 25 around the winter solstice to a virgin in humblesurroundings (a cave or a manger), and their births were heralded by a star inthe Eastern sky. Some grew to be spiritual masters with twelve disciples (Horus,Mithras, and Jesus), performing miracles and giving baptisms and communions.They all died (Dionysus dismembered by Titans, Attis and Adonis eaten by wildboars, and Horus, Mithras, and Jesus crucified) before experiencing a miraculousresurrection.In The Jesus Mysteries, authors Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy argue that therenever was a historical Jesus who walked the sands of Israel, but rather that heis a composite of the earlier godmen. But mythical figures are often based onreal people—think Johnny Appleseed—and I prefer to contemplate allpossibilities, preserving the mystery of this legacy. While I take issue withFreke and Gandy on this point, I appreciate the parallels they draw betweenJesus and the other godmen. In the following passage, they point out some of thesimilarities between Mithras and Jesus as they describe how the Vatican sitsatop a destroyed Mithraic temple:Where today the gathered faithful revere their Lord Jesus Christ, the ancientsworshiped another godman who, like Jesus, had been miraculously born on December25 before three shepherds. In this ancient sanctuary Pagan congregations onceglorified a Pagan redeemer who, like Jesus, was said to have ascended to heavenand to have promised to come again at the end of time to judge the quick and thedead. On the same spot where the Pope celebrates the Catholic mass, Paganpriests also celebrated a symbolic meal of bread and wine in memory of theirsavior who, just like Jesus, had declared: “He who will not eat of my body anddrink of my blood, so that he will be made one with me and I with him, the sameshall not know salvation.”6 [Phil_9781583943434_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts006]According to Freke and Gandy, a number of the mystery-school godmen were calledthe “Son of God,” and some “Sun of God.” The word “horizon” comes from“Horus-Sun,” meaning sunrise. As the Egyptian god of daytime, Horus battled hisjackal-headed enemy Set (“Sun-Set”), the bringer of night, in a cosmic battle oflight and dark. Jesus played a similar role as Horus: he was “the light of theworld” surrounded by twelve disciples who represented the twelve months of theyear and the twelve signs of the zodiac. The sun enters each zodiac sign atthirty degrees (30 × 12 = 360); both of these “Suns of God” embarked on theirministries at the age of thirty. The classic zodiac cross bisects the twelveastrological signs within a circle. The sun hangs “crucified” in the center asit passes through the precession of the equinoxes, something the mystery schoolsfollowed closely as each new sign marked the next world age.Given the astrological significance of the cross and their sun gods, wisdomtraditions often depicted the crucifixion in their writing and art. A well-knownsecond- or third-century European talisman depicts a human figure that lookslike Jesus on the cross below a crescent moon and seven stars. The inscriptionis translated as Orpheus Becomes a Bacchoi. Orpheus was a prophet in theDionysian mysteries, and Bacchoi refers to an enlightened disciple who hadundergone the final stages of initiation. Around the same time that the talismanwas crafted, a Roman graffiti artist sketched on a pillar the image of acrucified donkey, which symbolized the initiates’ death to their animalisticnature and ascension to the higher Self. The first portrayal of Jesus on a crossdid not appear until two hundred years later.Rather than rejoicing about the similarities between Jesus and the other godmen,literalist Christian leaders—who had not experienced the secret gnosis of thehighest mysteries—created dams and divisions between the diverse spiritualstreams that originally flowed from the same mystical source. As Freke and Gandyexplain, the parallels between Mithras and Jesus threatened the emerging schoolof Christianity that they call the “Literalist Church,” which was expandingacross the Roman Empire. Bishops such as Justin Martyr, Tertullian, and Irenaeuswent so far as to make the ridiculous claim that the devil had engaged in“diabolical mimicry” and plagiarizing by anticipation by popularizing the storyof Mithras before Jesus was born so as to dupe the weak-minded.7[Phil_9781583943434_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts007]In The Golden Bough, James Frazer noted a similar contention concerning Attis,the mystery god from Asia Minor, and Jesus. “In point of fact it appears fromthe testimony of an anonymous Christian, who wrote in the fourth century of ourera, that Christians and pagans alike were struck by the remarkable coincidencebetween the death and resurrection of their respective deities, and that thecoincidence formed a theme of bitter controversy between the adherents of therival religions, the pagans contending that the resurrection of Christ was aspurious imitation of the resurrection of Attis, and the Christians assertingwith equal warmth that the resurrection of Attis was a diabolical counterfeit ofthe resurrection of Christ.”8 [Phil_9781583943434_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts008]Literalist Christians refused to accept that the rites of the mystery schoolsform the central narrative of the New Testament, but the similarities are tooplentiful to ignore. Jesus experienced a baptism (spiritual cleansing), aEucharist (communion), an anointing (“Christ” means “the anointed one”), and thedeath and resurrection ritual. These mystical rites provided a rare alchemicaleducation, unifying polar forces for initiates. The Gospel of Philip, one of theso-called Gnostic texts, contains the following passage: “The Lord dideverything in a mystery, a baptism and a chrism and a eucharist and a redemptionand a bridal chamber. […] he said, ‘I came to make the things below like thethings above, and the things outside like those inside. I came to unite them inthe place.”9 [Phil_9781583943434_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts009] (11.3)The word mystery appears twenty-seven times in the New Testament, including in 1Corinthians (4:1), with Paul telling fellow Christians, “Let a man regard us inthis manner, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.” Jesusspeaks of clandestine teachings for those in the inner circles when he says tohis disciples, “To you has been given the mystery of the kingdom of God, butthose who are outside get everything in parables.” (Mark 4:11)As I had already learned through my study of pneuma, early Christians utilizedspiritual energy—in the form of the Holy Spirit—for personal transformation.Jesus baptized with fire and spirit, healed with power, and transmitted wisdomto his disciples through the bubbling spring drawn from a higher source. Thepurpose of the mystery schools was to create pneumatics—people full of spiritualenergy. In the Gospel of Thomas, Jesus says to his disciples, “Whoever drinksfrom my mouth will become like me; I myself shall become that person, and thehidden things will be revealed to him.” (11.2:108)Even common Christian terms reveal clues to this ancient transformationalprocess. The original Greek word for “sin,” hamartia, turns out to be an archeryterm meaning “missing the mark.” This nuance lacks the guilt and shame pastorshave used for centuries to control their flocks. Missing the mark simplyindicates a state in which seekers have strayed from their path and need to getback on course. Similarly, the Hebrew name for Satan translates as “adversary,”highlighting the ego and personality attachment the soul needs to overcome inorder to reach higher states of consciousness. The Greek metanoia is usuallytranslated as “repent,” but it actually means to “change one’s mind” or “have ashift in consciousness,” which can occur when one absorbs higher frequenciesfrom someone who is closely connected to source-energy such as Jesus. Mostsurprisingly, Christ was not initially our Lord and savior but rather our soter,meaning “healer,” “bestower of health,” or “one who makes whole.” Stayingconnected to universal spirit, Jesus traveled through the rift of separationconsciousness to heal us and bring us back to our celestial home. In the Gospelof Thomas, Jesus says, “I am the one who comes from what is whole.” (11.2:61)When we finally let go of our attachments to the material realm, we becomeredeemed (apolytrosis, which also means “release” in Greek.)I couldn’t help wonder what happened to the original meanings of these words, aswell as to the numerous Gnostic churches that had proliferated in the MiddleEast. When the Romans destroyed Jerusalem and the Second Temple in AD 70,putting an end to the Jewish revolt, they left one-third of the population deadand the Christian mysteries fractured into pieces. Members joined the massexodus out of the country. Those who had not been exposed to the inner mysteriesstarted up literalist churches. The remaining Gnostics called these rigid sects“imitation churches” as they did not teach the secret gnosis of “Christ within.”According to the Apocalypse of Peter, literalist church fathers were “drycanals” bereft of consciousness-expanding pneuma, yet arrogantly claimed to bethe sole gatekeepers of heaven. “Some who do not understand mystery speak ofthings which they do not understand, but they will boast that the mystery of thetruth is theirs alone.” (VII.3) These empty churches sprouted up across theRoman Empire. In a sad touch of historical irony, their leaders—such as theinfamous Irenaeus, the Bishop of Lyon—became heretic hunters attacking those whostill carried the inner teachings of their religion. This is documented in theSecond Treatise of the Great Seth: “We were hated and persecuted, not only bythose who are ignorant, but also by those who think they are advancing the nameof Christ, since they were unknowingly empty, not knowing who they are.” (VII.2)As the number of Christians multiplied in Roman lands, power-hungry Constantineswitched the state religion to Christianity to co-opt this growing movement,uniting Rome under one God, one religion, and one emperor. In 325, he oversawthe Council of Nicaea, at which church fathers reduced the vast library ofChristian written knowledge to a few documents that became the New Testament.In 391, Emperor Theodosius passed an edict to close all pagan temples and burntheir books. Christian hordes set out on murderous rampages across the empiresmashing all traces of the mystery traditions from which their own religion hadblossomed. They killed off the last of the Gnostic circles and destroyed theirlibraries, churches, scrolls, and most importantly the flame of gnosis that hadbeen carefully passed down throughout the ages. By 410, the Roman Empire hadnearly torn itself apart, and the Visigoths strolled in to finish the job. Onlyeighty-five years after the Council of Nicaea, the Dark Ages had begun.10[Phil_9781583943434_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts010]Poring over the lost Gnostic texts of the Nag Hammadi Library, I was surprisedby how many of them focused on reframing the Garden of Eden story, as I hadsuggested during the activist meeting in my living room. The Secret Book ofJohn, also known as the Apocryphon of John (11.1), for example, explains thehuman origin story quite differently than Genesis does. The Gnostic textsdescribe a complicated cosmology that began with a single being or parent whowas ineffable, eternal, immeasurable light, and created an image or reflectionof itself, Barbelo, which in turn begot a multitude of heavenly planes (aeons)that were part of a wider divine realm (the pleroma).Christ was not just a man but a distinct aeon or larger divine being in thepleroma. Those who fully realized the mysteries became one with Christ, carryingthis high vibrational force inside themselves. Bedazzled by the cosmic palace,Sophia, the aeon of wisdom, created her own world without consent from theüber-parent or her male counterpart. The experiment went awry, and Sophiaseparated from the pleroma, creating a sinister ruler called the Demiurge (theword means “craftsman” or “maker”), who manufactured our counterfeit materialworld.This was the Old Testament God, whom Gnostics called Yaldabaoth, Samael (Aramaicfor the “blind god”), and Saklas (Aramaic for “fool”), as he believed himself tobe the only god in the universe, ignorant of the pleroma and the omnipresentlight of the parent. Breathing life into Adam (and unknowingly the divine spiritof Sophia), the Demiurge ruled over humans with his demonic friends, thearchons. The angelic realms of the pleroma embarked on a rescue mission forSophia, Adam, and Eve. The Secret Book of John tells of Jesus sneaking like anundercover agent behind enemy lines into the Garden, inviting the first humansto eat of the Tree of Knowledge (“the Epinoia of the light”) to “awaken them outof the depth of sleep” and their “fallen state.” (11.1)The Gnostics’ description of archons immediately intrigued my activist side.These devilish autocrats seemed representative of the oppressive empires thathave dominated Western history books. Bush and the neocons, the Halliburtons andBechtels have followed a long, shadowy lineage of hierarchical powers profitingfrom human suffering while expanding their empires. Maybe the Gnosticsunderstood that we needed mystical agents of transformation smuggling incelestial light to liberate lost souls on our planet.Before I donned the tricornered hat of the American Revel-ution with GreeneDragon, I would flinch every time I passed an American flag on someone’s lawn,assuming that its owners supported the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Once Iembraced the parts of U.S. history that we can be legitimately proud of,however, I experienced a striking shift in attitude and cried “Liberty” with myfellow patriots when marching by the gigantic flag covering the New York StockExchange’s front pillars.The same shift happened for me with the cross. One day, I found myself steppinginto Grace Church in the East Village, glancing at the stained-glass auras ofJesus in the windows. My attention settled on the white cross above the altar,and I felt a sudden affinity with this alchemical symbol and its promise ofpersonal transformation. I experienced a visceral connection with the millionsof people who had been wounded or misled by literalist Christianity, robbed oftheir own divine spark. For almost two millennia, the Judeo-Christian traditionhas supplied the underlying operating platform for our civilization—ourlanguages, laws, mores, work ethic, sexuality, even our way of perceiving time(with the Gregorian calendar)—shaping our worldview, whether we realized it ornot.To come to terms with our history and ourselves, we have to integrate thistradition. That doesn’t necessarily mean plodding through obscure Gnostic texts,making sense of strange Demiurge names. The mysteries lay right there in the NewTestament for those with “eyes to see” and “ears to hear.” We need an upgrade ofthe Protestant Revolution, one that incorporates the gnosis of Christconsciousness. Imagine already established churches—the one on yourblock—enhancing their services with meditation, prayer, breathwork, energyhealing, body movement, possibly even late-night dancing, and among the moreradicalized, the dispensing of psychoactive sacraments. Why build entirely newsystems for connecting to Christ consciousness when the institutions—whetherMethodist, Lutheran, or Baptist—have already been created? Today these religionsare like the “dry canals” that the Apocalypse of Peter referred to. Toincorporate Christ consciousness, they would have to give up their addiction todominating worshipers, address the evolution of the spirit, and infuse theessence of the mysteries into their hollow edifices.Many popular Eastern disciplines today have us turning away from the worldaround us, meditating on our navels. But Christ wasn’t only a yogi; he was anactivist, carrying his message to those who most needed it. Our ailing planetneeds spiritual warriors, ones capable of standing up to the Western materialismmachine, so we can create sustainable societies that care for their citizens,harmonize with the cycles of nature, and receive and honor the vast healinglight that quietly connects us all."},{"pageContent":"[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_013_r1.jpg]VOMIT AND VISION[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_L02_r1.jpg]TAVIS JERKED IN AND OUT OF LANES, gassing through red lights as we shot downCanal Street in her ’88 maroon Volkswagen Fox. Her activist stunts were like herdriving—no holds barred. Before the 2004 Republican National Convention, sheorchestrated an aerial photo shoot that featured dozens of naked women, pubesshaved, lying on a snowy Central Park lawn, their bodies spelling out No Bush.This image radiated across the web, attracting international media attention.Tavis also coordinated the most controversial protest against the RNC,theatrically recreating a Roman vomitorium. Actors in sandals, togas, and greenleaf crowns gorged on a potluck buffet and purged into gold buckets, anot-too-subtle comment on consumerism gone haywire in the American Empire.Disappointed by the election results, she was reconsidering her tactics—as Iwas—wondering if pointed political messages were enough to inspire people tomake real change. It felt appropriate for me to join Tavis and her partner,Mitchell, on a journey to try ayahuasca, the Amazonian shamans’ brew.With almost ten years difference between them—Tavis was the older atthirty-six—these two made an unusual couple. Tavis had high Cherokee cheekbonesand long brown Jewish hair. Always in jeans and T-shirts (never dresses orskirts), she emanated a swarthy, tomboy sexiness. Although we were good friends,I was secretly jealous of her brassy leadership, as she never seemed to sufferfrom the kinds of anxieties or insecurities that shook my confidence.Mitchell’s black dreadlocks, soft face, and tech artisanship gave him acomfortable, quirky, Burner-geek appeal. Always soldering together bizarre, DIYelectronic devices, he was the first guy you called if your hard drive wentdown, but with an Asperger-like dearth of emotional empathy, he was the last oneyou’d want to have a drink with when mending a crushed heart. A digital geniuswho managed the servers of a major financial firm, Mitchell’s voice had astrange lack of inflection that made him sound part android. In fact, he gainedsome notoriety by being one of the first humans to insert an RFID(radio-frequency identification) chip under the skin of his wrist. He consideredthis act a punk counterstrike to corporations like Walmart that had developedthis technology to invade our privacy. Mitchell received countless emails fromChristian fundamentalists across the country begging him to remove the chip,concerned that this will be how the Antichrist inserts “the mark of the Beast”on humans as foretold in the book of Revelation.In the car, Mitchell, Tavis, and I discussed the ayahuasca trip reports we hadread on the Internet, especially from Erowid, a popular portal dedicated to theuse of psychedelic substances that expand consciousness. Composed of two plantsfrom the rainforest—one containing the psychoactive chemical DMT(dimethyltryptamine), the other a double-helix-shaped vine with monoamineoxidase (MAO) inhibitors, which allow the gut to process the DMT—ayahuascaapparently offered partakers a cup of life-changing experience. According to theonline accounts, journeyers blasted into geometrically complex mystical realms,purged out long-term diseases (some claimed to receive cures for brain or breastcancer), met spiritual beings or power animals from the astral planes, orconnected with a vast, tree-shaped web of conscious light. I wondered if thisluminous tree was the multi-branched World Tree of Life that mystics across theplanet revered. If so, this brew might provide the visionary catalyst I neededin pursuing the next step in the Eden investigation I now obsessed over.Many of the reports mentioned the vine speaking to the participants, indicatinga direct encounter with an intelligence outside of the self. Mitchellrobotically told of one story where the plant said, “I warned you not to comeback. I let you off the first time, but this time’s not going to be easy!”Still obsessing over the word “alien” given to me the night I started seeingenergy, I was most drawn to tales of galactic contact. One man claimed thatpraying mantises the size of people had whisked him through gold and red nebulaevia a translucent bubble; one talked of silver Andromedan space ships hoveringin the sky, channeling otherworldly healing songs for a sick person lying on thejungle floor; another told of bug-eyed, elf-eared, multidimensional shamans with“George Clinton rainbow dreadlocks” slipping through wormholes to downloadinformation on sunken Atlantis and humanity’s similarly endangered future.In some reports, blue beings, supposedly from the Pleiadian star system, or talland tan Egyptian-looking Sirians with elongated heads warned earthlings thatarchon-like lizards from another planet had unplugged several strands of our DNAor used psychotronic devices in the fourth dimension to cage Earth in a dense,low-vibratory reality and were feeding off our negative energies for lunch. Ididn’t regard these bizarre tales as factual scenarios of a larger cosmicecology, but rather as exciting Homeric myths stretching my imagination toenvision a larger esoteric drama stretching across Captain Kirk’s finalfrontier.Zipping past the budding yellow birch and red oak trees off I-87 on a cloudyspring day, Tavis asked why Jade hadn’t joined us. Jade, I explained, sufferedfrom Woody Allen–level hypochondria and was petrified of la purga, the legendarypuking associated with the vine. Trip report after trip report dwelled on thepainful wrenching that ayahuasca induces, although shamans consider it a kind ofcleansing that brings visions afterward. Jade was also upset with me foraccepting a gig as facilities manager at Eyebeam Atelier, an art and technologyincubator in Chelsea that provides “state-of-the-art tools for digital researchand experimentation,” as its website explains.“Why can’t you get a job that utilizes your brain,” Jade pleaded over the Thaidinner I had treated us to in order to celebrate my new income. For once, I waspaying for one of our dates, which made me sit straighter, feeling more like theprovider that society expects men to be. “You’re one of the smartest guys Iknow, but you’re always taking these crappy jobs. Is this how you’re going tobuild a career?” Jade downed the bottom half of her Singha and motioned to theshort Taiwanese waitress for another bottle. Tears began to appear, and Jaderubbed them with her napkin, smearing silver glitter across her cheeks.I explained that I once wanted to be a writer and then saw myself as a mediaactivist, but now I was lost. “Why don’t you teach English again? You likeddoing that in Prague and Spain.” The waitress brought over Jade’s Singha andpoured half of it into a fresh glass. I told Jade that teaching English was acop-out, that I wanted to contribute more to humanity than advocating the properuse of the past perfect tense. “Jonny, I just don’t know.” Jade lifted her glassto her frowning lips. “You may never figure this out.”As our car pulled into a small town in the Irish Catskills, Tavis shared some ofher own mystical experiences. A couple of years ago, she dreamed of an unusualcity in the desert with burning wood temples spewing green and blue flames intothe sky, sculptures of white seahorses rising up from the sand, and ladybug artcars waddling through a black-light illuminated forest. She eventually witnessedeach of these scenes during her initial visit to the Burning Man Festival. Tavisalso began perceiving bright, narrow rivers of light along people’s spines andthe cracks and dams where energetic wounds had caused the energetic current towaver from its straight and natural path. Sometimes she would try to helpfriends, telling them where to clear those pranic blocks, but none of themunderstood what she meant. When Tavis moved into a new apartment, she sensed“bad energy” in her backyard and refused to visit the garden. While tilling thesoil to plant heirloom tomatoes, her boyfriend at the time found a pile ofbones, which the police later confirmed to be human.“There’s something profound happening now on this planet,” she said,deliberately speeding past a stop sign on Main Street. “I’ve felt this my wholelife; that I’m here, as many of us are, to help usher in something big,something different. Don’t you think there’s a reason why so many of us arehaving these wild experiences?” Although I was skeptical about how many of uswere really here, the thought of thousands—perhaps millions—of people turning onto Gnostic inquiry and energetic awakening captivated the more radicalizedaspects of my being, prompting visions of a bohemian friendly, mysticallycharged planetary renaissance.We pulled into a gravel driveway a mile outside of town. Three other cars sat infront of a small, deteriorating farmhouse that featured the same flaking whitepaint and sinking front porch as the humidity-wrecked houses from my parents’economically depressed homeland in north central Missouri. This would be liketripping at my grandparents’ house. Dark clouds had rolled in from the West, andthe brown hills around us looked sad and ominous.Nick, our “aya-guide” for the journey, stepped out of a two-story chicken coopbehind the house. Trained as an ethnobotanist among tribes in the Amazon, Nicksported an eclectic fashion ecosystem—Peruvian poncho, Shipibo embroidered hat,Ashaninka red and white beaded necklaces, and Gap khaki pants.A mutual friend had introduced us a month earlier at a Williamsburg loft party.When I asked Nick how he started guiding psychedelic journeys, he told me in afriendly, nasally voice that in Peru the vine had told him to learn how to brewayahuasca and share it with people in the States for healing. “Really?” I noddedpolitely, “The vine told you that?” He said that ayahuasca was the most powerfulmedicinal plant he had ever encountered, and medicinal plants were hisprofession. Still, I wasn’t sure I wanted to embark on a journey with a skinnypseudo-shaman who looked barely thirty. He may know about the medicinal benefitsof dandelions and lyre-leaved sage, and may even be able to survive a foodstoppage in New York City—having lived off edible plants in Central Park for aweek—but I didn’t trust that any of his experiences could match those of thelineage holders from the Secoya and Conibo tribes, who had done this forcenturies.Nevertheless, I had been curious about ayahuasca since reading Dr. RickStrassman’s DMT: The Spirit Molecule. In the book, Strassman offers the poetichypothesis that DMT, which is endogenous to the human body as well as tocountless plants and other animals, is produced by the pineal gland. This tinygland, weighing one-tenth of a gram and shaped like a pine-cone (its name comesfrom the Latin pineus, which means “relating to pine”), sits in the position ofthe third eye, at the sixth chakra near the top of the body’s Tree of Life. Itwould be fitting for this mysterious gland to secrete a substance that triggersmystical experiences.Nick helped carry our bags up a wooden ladder to the second floor of the chickencoop. Inside, five NYC Burners with Mexican blankets draped over their shoulderswere preparing the space with ornamental rugs and wild flowers. They lit incenseand sprayed sweet-smelling oils in the air.“It’s kind of quaint,” I said hopefully. But all of their efforts couldn’t hidethe wire windows, busted-up floorboards, and musty smell of rotting wood.“It looks like a horror movie set,” Mitchell replied robotically. A swarm ofangry butterflies raged through my abdomen as I pictured a long afternoontrapped in the grotesque psychedelic chambers of my mind.Nick whistled for us to sit in a circle. He played a few songs on a gambus, ashort-necked lute from Yemen, then whispered Shipibo healing prayers over theplastic Canada Dry bottle holding the ayahuasca. “If you get into any jams, Ihave wild chili pepper to bring you back.” He poured the murky brown liquid in aceramic cup and handed it first to Tavis. When it was my turn, I asked “the vineof souls” to help me with my next clue in uncovering the secrets of the Tree ofLife, and how that might help heal our world in crisis.I cringed while swallowing the viscous substance, which tasted like an unsavorymixture of coffee, green tea, and dirt. We sat quietly for forty-five minutesuntil I noticed the weathered ceiling boards slither and bend, curling intoimmaculate designs. The battered wood wove into a beautiful alien language thatI somehow recognized. The characters looked like Celtic rune merged with binarycode. I felt as if I were about to remember their meaning when the paint flakeson the wood brightened and blossomed into elaborate beige and cream-coloreddoilies, which suddenly bulged forward, descending toward me.“Just kick back and relax,” I heard a presence tell me. I immediately recognizedit as the same voice that had spoken in my room the night I started seeingenergy fields. “Cowboy, you’re in for a fun ride.” This time the speaker had asense of humor, calling me “cowboy,” but I didn’t find it funny. I immediatelysat up, sipping up short, panicked breaths. I had dabbled with mushrooms and LSDbefore, but even with the hallucinations, I knew my experiences were aprojection of my own mind. This time, just as others said in the onlineayahuasca trip reports, another entity was telling me to chill out. At least Ipresumed it was another entity. Could I trust this being? Where did it comefrom? What did it look like? Why was it hiding behind these lattice designs, andwhy did it follow me around? Maybe this was a helpful spirit, or perhaps I wascrazy and hearing voices that weren’t really there? Whatever it was, I wasn’tsure I wanted it around.Placing my palms carefully on the wooden floor, I slowly lowered my body back tothe ground. The fanciful doilies in the ceiling blossomed like flowers anddanced down toward me. I felt them lock into small vortexes of energy, which Ipresumed to be the major chakras, running along the midline of my body. I hadnever encountered the chakras physically before, but in my heightened state ofawareness, these formerly subtle centers were now powerful pneumatic motors thatraised my body’s vibration as the doilies spun them faster and faster. Tearstrembled into my eyes with the acceleration. My organs, bones, and skin grewoppressively heavy, crushing in on themselves and squeezing out the air in mylungs. “Oh, my God,” I thought, “I’m dying.” With a sudden flash of light, thepressure released, and my energy consciousness shot out of my scalp, blastingthrough an undulating veil of colorful fractal patterns until I found myspirit—if that’s what you would call it—swimming in a serene, velvety-blackvoid. A school of globular white lights swam up to me like dolphins, blinking onand off as if saying, “Welcome home.”Floating bodiless in this peaceful void, I recalled a line from The JesusMysteries: that the Gnostics were “ ‘psychonauts’ who boldly explored the finalfrontiers of inner space, searching for the origins and meaning of life.”11[Phil_9781583943434_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts011] Was it possible that theAmazonian vine would reveal to me traces of the ancient Christian mysteries?As I harbored this thought, a full-sized movie screen suddenly unfurled from thedark nothingness. Scenes from my life projected in supersonic speed onto itswhite surface—moving to the mountains from the suburbs at the age of two, myfather losing his job, hiding in the basement from my mother’s rants, receivingmy high school diploma, holding keg-stand competitions in college, fumblingthrough sex with my first girlfriend, healing my throat in Prague, and screaming“The Republicans are coming” down Lexington Avenue in my Jonny America outfit.The screen then showed a young pregnant woman, maybe sixteen or seventeen yearsold, being tortured in a dungeon or bunker with dirt walls. I tried to makesense of the image and how it pertained to me. The presence whispered throughthe void, “Cowboy, that was you, a long time ago. You’ve carried the sorrow andanger from that trauma through many lifetimes.”“Reincarnation?” I asked the voice, confused. I hadn’t thought much about pastlives, or about people who believed in them.“You chose to be born to your mother in this incarnation to relive this terror,”the voice said. “You’re learning to transmute those energies. So get thisstraight, okay? Your mother is your guide. You got it, cowboy?”Before I had time to digest this bombshell, my consciousness swished back intomy body, but I wasn’t exactly me. I saw myself as a majestic bear-human on astone throne, a wild but graceful animal with a human continence. “Thisrepresents the story of tribal humanity,” the voice advised. That image soondisappeared to reveal a half-human, half-lion on a gilded throne, similarlyanimal but more regal. Embroidered red and silver tapestries hung on the wallsof the vast palace chamber. Millions of other half-lion royals appeared withgolden branches stretching out of their glowing crowns, connecting us in agilded web. “This represents the story of civilization, humanity’s journey outof nature into separation, laws, and technological achievement.”Experiencing this vision had a profound calming effect on me. I shed some of thenegative judgments I held regarding humankind’s leap out of Eden and theviolence and cruelty that journey entailed. Perhaps it was all a transitionalphase, a necessary second act that will lead to a transcendent third. As thisidea occurred to me, two golden eagles—each with an eight-foot wingspan—rose upfrom behind my throne, circling higher and higher until they broke through theceiling. Then the room crashed into rubble.Out of the dust I saw a snake-human rise on an invisible throne. It had yelloweyes and a slow-flickering red tongue; its scales boasted a complicated diamondpattern that looked futuristically alien and synthetic. Powerful white lightemanated from every pore. His gaze struck me as sophisticated, telepathic, andfull of Buddha-like compassion. This snake-man was the coming together of natureand technology after a ten thousand year schism, an enlightened, nondualisticsynthesis.“Cowboy, this represents where you humans are evolving,” the voice announced,“toward something beyond your wildest, three-dimensional imaginations, yet youalready know this and hold the seed within each of you. It’s already happening,so get ready for some fun. The party is just getting started,” the presencegiggled almost ominously. The snake sucked in his tongue and winked at me.With that final gesture, I disappeared into a swirling Doctor Who–like wormhole,racing through a tunnel of kaleidoscopic colors until the voice commanded, “Opensesame.” It took me a minute to register my coordinates as I opened my eyes. Iwas sitting on an Oriental rug in a dilapidated chicken coop. Everyone else wasnestled quietly under their Mexican blankets, off on their own journeys. Nickwaved incense in the air, whistling along to birdcalls he had recorded in theAmazon, which played on a pair of portable speakers.The presence was not yet gone. It asked me to lie down and close my eyes, whichI did. It then began to zap healing light into my anxiety-ridden abdomen.Painful memories surfaced as the light opened knots of trapped energy in thedepths of my intestines. There was my mother screaming, “We’re going to the poorhouse”; my brother punching my stomach while holding me down to the floor; medrinking myself into oblivion at Denver’s Lion’s Lair and standing on therailing of Prague’s Charles Bridge, considering ending it all. The white lightdissolved the pain of these traumas.I meditated on how these experiences could have mirrored the victimization of atortured woman who might have been me many lifetimes ago? I saw a possible linkbetween the woman’s suffering and the melancholy I felt as a kid, brooding overblue snow-capped Mount Evans at dusk, yearning for something I had lost. Perhapsthe root of my suffering went beyond an unpleasant childhood, to a spiritualsource unperceivable by educated psychologists.As the white-light surgery reached a sharp pain under my navel, a medievalportrait of Jade and me flashed before my eyes. We each wore long red robes,pendants around our necks, and gold crowns with crosses sticking out of the top.“Jade is your queen,” the voice informed me. “You have karma together, so stickthis one out, okay? No more playing the field, at least not for a awhile.”“You’re kidding!” I yelled back. Somehow, I was able to take in stride animalroyalty, energy healing, and a past life as a tortured, pregnant woman. But thiswas going too far. Jade as my queen? I had grown up with a fiery-tempered woman,and my tolerance for it went only so far, no matter what some uppity presencehad to say about it.“Just consider it,” the voice said, then continued the light surgery for therest of the afternoon.The effects of the ayahuasca faded by nightfall. Sitting at a long wooden tablein the farmhouse kitchen, we nourished our bodies with Nick’s vegetarian versionof feijoada, Brazilian bean soup. While eating, my fellow journeyers shared thecommunications they had received from the plant.“I asked the vine, ‘This is just me talking back to myself, right?’ ” Mitchellrecounted. “And it answered, ‘Sure, if that makes it easier for you.’ ” A womanwho was still wearing a Mexican blanket over her shoulders said, “I was told weneed to rush to save creation on this planet. There’s not much time left.”“The vine said we need to stop fighting the old systems and start creating newcontainers for people who are going through these spiritual openings,” Tavisreflected. “Together, we need to build something that’s never existed before—aglobal network of light.”"},{"pageContent":"[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_014_r1.jpg]COSMIC SNAKESAND LADDERS[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_L02_r1.jpg]TIBETAN MONKS ADORNED IN RED ROBES and yellow hats shaped like upside-down pushbrooms led the hundred people in the audience in a silent meditation. Visionarypainters Alex and Allyson Grey flanked the monks on stage. I heard from membersof their community that they wore only black in public, which was the casetoday. Allyson had on a dark cotton dress. She tilted her head in a gentle butproud pose, while Alex—with long white wizard hair and a wise thin chin—sat tallin a black blazer. I squeezed through one of the back rows to the empty foldoutchair between Jade and Rena. When I passed, Jade slapped my ass so hard it brokethe silence for several rows around us. I snickered along with her—I had found awoman who out-prankstered me.I took in the familiar room around us. For the last week, I had been visitingthe Grey’s Chelsea studio every evening after finishing work at Eyebeam, whichwas located just a few blocks away. Surrounding us were paintings of coupleskissing, having sex, and giving birth—but with a mystical twist. Alex portrayedthe wild zigzagging red, blue, and green energy patterns and auric fields ofthese common experiences. One work that especially captured my attention showedthe spirit of a dying man drifting out of his crown chakra into a bright lightabove, which echoed my own out-of-body experience on ayahuasca.I found comfort and support from these paintings, as they articulated an unusualspiritual reality that I was being introduced to. I also met a like-minded sceneof twenty-somethings who hung around the space daily, seemingly without jobs,although the tripper aesthetic of mushroom necklaces, psychedelic Tool shirts,and tie-dyed outfits grated against my own faux-fur-meets-cowboy Burning Mantastes. Still I was happy to discover an entire community that talked about theentheogenic substances and esoteric topics I found so compelling. As Tavis hadsuggested on the ride to our ayahuasca ceremony, there were more of us out therethan I had thought.Tonight’s event promised some amazing things: horn-playing monks, the Greys’visionary art, and a complex sand mandala composed of bright, interconnectingflowers, triangles, and concentric circles in which the Tibetans had investedmore than a hundred hours of work. After their performance, the monks wouldbrush their handcrafted masterpiece into oblivion as a way to symbolize theimpermanence of our physical world.I specifically came to the event to meet the plain-looking, seventy-year-oldwoman who sat next to Rena. Her mom, Becky, was visiting, and Rena brought heralong so that Jade and I could meet her. Becky had curling-ironed silver-bluehair, so typical of grandmothers everywhere, and large bifocal glasses that tookup half her face. I was disappointed that she had no obvious features thatsuggested she could give birth to such a psychically talented “indigo child” asRena.It was a miracle that Rena had been born at all. In a futile attempt tointerrupt the pregnancy, her mom had downed bottles of Southern Comfort andsleeping pills, which resulted in Rena’s being born blind in one eye. Thiscondition contributed a strange irony to Rena’s vision: she was able to seelights and colors that few others witnessed, yet she lacked depth perception andwould sometimes miss a stair or reach toward the wrong spot for a doorknob. Asthe group meditation began, I peeked to watch Becky’s closed, wrinkled eyes,wishing I could read her mind and learn what tragedy had happened to Rena—theone she still hadn’t shared with Jade.After the meditation, the Tibetans played their ornate silver horns—high-pitchedshort ones and elongated six-foot cannons that sounded like foghorns. Renagrinned at me as she opened her eyes. She wore a Poison T-shirt that revealedthe scraggly roots of the cottonwood tattoo on her arm. Jade had glittered boththeir faces with metallic pink eye shadow for the occasion.“What’s up, gray one?” Rena whispered over the music.“What are you talking about?” I asked.“Your aura. It’s gray, like concrete taking shape. Something has come in to youafter that ayahuasca journey. I bet you’ll notice some changes.” Rena gave meher usual all-knowing nod, which frustrated me.The Tibetans blew discordant tunes accompanied by deep chants and grunts thatseemed to aim more at activating energy centers than at pleasing eardrums.Afterward, the crowd followed the monks and the Greys into the hall next door,the Chapel of Sacred Mirrors (CoSM), where the sand mandala sat on a squaretable in the middle of the long, vaulted room. The walls featured a sequence oflife-sized portraits of naked men and women. The first few revealed theirbiological systems, including the muscular, pulmonary, and nervous systems. Therest of the series displayed the chakra system, auras, and finally a mantransforming into swirls of pure white light. At the far end of these imageshung a painting of a glowing Jesus with his heart-center illuminated in orangeflames.“I knew I’d find you hanging out with your old buddy” Jade jabbed me in the ribwhile I gazed at the image. She had bunched her hair into two adorable, PrincessLeia clumps on top of her head. I squeezed her Powerpuff Girl shirt, smelled thelavender fragrance of her dark curls, and thought that the ayahuasca presencemay have been right—perhaps she was my queen. As the Tibetans moved around thesand mandala, we overheard Becky asking Rena what the monks’ auras looked like.“Mom, if you wanted to know about these things, you should’ve taken an interestwhen I was a kid,” Rena moved a few feet away from her. I guess I would have towait for introductions.The monks prayed over their meticulously constructed mandala and its dizzyingdisplay of tiny, colored designs. Then without much ado, they grabbed whiteplastic sporks and scooped millions of perfectly aligned grains of sand into aclump of brown dust.Hanging out with the CoSM community over the next few weeks, I had severalregulars tell me about their own experiences communicating with intelligentsnakes while on ayahuasca. I became obsessed with serpents, wondering why theyappeared in so many visions, including my own meeting with the illuminatedwinking snake. When I brought the subject up to my aya-guide Nick, herecommended that I check out The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins ofKnowledge by Jeremy Narby.A Swiss anthropologist, Narby writes about encountering two enormous talkingsnakes on a spirit-vine journey with the Ashaninka tribe in Peru and afterwardcoming to wonder why shamanic and mystical traditions across the planetworshiped serpents as creator gods, healers, and catalysts for transformation.He suggested that the answer might lie in the snake’s form. Narby found thatimages of snakes in shamanic activity frequently appeared as twisting braids,vines, ropes, or ladders shown in the form of the double helix. Could theseimages be hinting at the pattern of DNA? Perhaps by altering theirconsciousness, shamans were able to interact with the essence or spirit of DNAin the act of healing their patients. As crazy as this possibility seemed, theevidence he accumulated was fascinating and impressive.Narby discussed a Mesopotamian seal from 2200 BC entitled “The Serpent LordEnthroned.” The image features two commingled snakes, which form a double-helixpattern, next to a regal-looking human figure on a throne near a fire altar.Aspects of the image echoed my own ayahuasca vision of a half-human, half-snakeking sitting serenely on an invisible throne with light bursting from him,almost as if he himself were a fire altar.I learned that a number of cultures depict snakes coiled around an axial rod,shaman’s rod, or Tree of Life. Around 2000 BC, the Sumerians worshiped theserpent god Ningizzida, known as the Lord of the Tree of Life, for his powers ofhealing and magic. The Egyptian goddess called Buto or Wadget, represented astwo entwined snakes twisting around papyrus reeds or deity poles, healed thechildren of Isis. The Greek god Asclepius learned his medicinal knowledge bywatching a serpent bring medicinal herbs to another fatally wounded snake. Therod of Asclepius, drawn with a serpent wrapped around it, serves as the symbolof the medical profession to this day. The Old Testament has its own shamanichealer in the figure of Moses whose rod shape-shifted into a serpent, afterwhich God turned his hand leprous and then healed it. (Exod. 4:1–8)DNA-shaped twin snakes, twisted ropes, Trees of Life, and stepped ladders oftenserved as the axis mundi in diverse mythologies, bridging the underworld to our“middle world” and then reaching up toward higher spiritual dimensions. The axismundi appears in the Bible when Jacob takes a rest on his way to Haran: “He hada dream, and behold, a ladder was set on the earth with its top reaching toheaven; and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.… ThenJacob awoke from his sleep … and said, ‘How awesome is this place! This is noneother than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.’ ” (Gen. 28:12–17)This passage led me to wonder if the ladder of our genes could open the gatewayallowing our consciousness to hitch a ride into angelic realms.After reading Narby, I discovered that yogis speak of two serpentine pranicchannels that snake back and forth along the human energy system’s central rod,the spine. These torsional waves, called the ida and pingala, create adouble-helix pattern around the middle current, the sushumna column, causing thesinuous flow of subtle energy up and down the body. These dualistic energythought patterns (one is masculine, the other feminine), originating at thethird eye (and the split hemispheres of our brain), spin the seven primarychakras, perpetuating the illusion of separation while turning the wheels ofattachment and suffering.Western esoteric traditions used a number of alchemical icons to express theimportance of balancing these spiritual forces. Some of these musty iconsportray twisting snakes on a central rod with the sun and moon on either side.Others show bizarre double-helix contraptions distilling magical elixirs in evenproportions. The Celtic cross, for example, stemming back to the early CopticChurch, featured intricate double-helix vines curling up the center column.Although early Gnostic texts never specifically name the ida and the pingalachannels, they do discuss the initiatic importance of transcending the dualityof the right and the left. In the Gospel of Philip, I came across the followingpassage: “Light and darkness, life and death, right and left, are brothers ofone another.… But those who are exalted above the world are indissoluble,eternal.” (11.3) Pneumatics who experienced states beyond perceived paradoxesbecame “indissoluble, eternal.” As the keepers of the inner mysteries, theyclaimed, “This power the apostles called ‘the right and the left.’ For thisperson is no longer a Christian but a Christ.” (11.3) As Jesus pointed out inthe Gospel of Thomas, “When you make the two into one, you will become childrenof Adam, and when you say, ‘Mountain, move from here!’ it will move.” (11.2:106)To get beyond the twisting illusory reality of the ida and the pingala and thedueling left and right hemispheres of the brain, yogis accessed kundalini(Sanskrit for “coiled like a snake”), a powerful feminine energy (Shakti) lyingdormant at the base of the spine. Yogi Gopi Krishna regarded this “serpentpower” or “fire serpent,” wrapped three and a half times around the sacrum, tobe the “most jealously guarded secret in human history”12[Phil_9781583943434_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts012] and “the guardian of humanevolution.”13 [Phil_9781583943434_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts013] When kundaliniawakens from its long slumber, it uncoils from the sacrum and shoots up thesushumna column, evaporating the twisting ida and pingala channels with itstremendous force. Blasting a path through the Tree of Life’s central trunk,kundalini pierces “the thousand-petaled lotus” of the crown chakra, uniting theinitiate with the oceanic waves of universal consciousness.We find this serpent image in Buddhist lore: when Buddha attained enlightenmentunder the Bodhi tree, the serpent king Mucilinda “came forth from his hiddenrealm and winding his coils seven times around the body of the Blessed One, heformed with his serpent’s hood a great canopy above the head of the Buddha.”14[Phil_9781583943434_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts014] A similar image appears in theOld Testament, when God commands Moses to set a fiery serpent upon a standardand raise it into the air so that those who are bitten and behold it will live.(Num. 21:8) This allusion is continued in the New Testament, when Jesus says,“As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Manbe lifted up; so that whoever believes will in him have eternal life.” (John3:13–15) By raising kundalini energy up the body’s Tree of Life, spiritualadepts pass through the veil of ego death and find themselves in communion withthe “ineffable,” “eternal,” and “immeasurable light” that the Gnosticsencountered (described in the Secret Book of John, 11.1).Wanting to experience this divine light firsthand, I registered for a kundaliniyoga course at a sixth-floor studio overlooking the Queensborough Bridge. Thiswas no ordinary yoga class. We swung our torsos up and over, scooped our bodiesback and forth, bent and released, snapped our bellies in and out, beltingexhausting mantras of “SUT-NAM, SUT-NAM, SUT-NAM” with every breath. This wasrigorous work, and I would end up winded and lightheaded after each class.I kept up the routine for a couple of weeks until one night I found myself alonewith the youngest teacher at the school as she was closing up. She was in herearly twenties, with a homely, freckled Peppermint Patty–like face thatcontrasted starkly with the exotic white turban and long sequined kurta she waswearing. We chatted in the narrow stairway on the way out. She asked me how Ibecame interested in kundalini yoga. I told her an abbreviated story of mythirtieth birthday—Rena, the party, the MDMA, seeing energy fields—and how thatled me to learn about the serpent on the Tree of Life. When I finished, shecrossed her arms and looked away.“You took a drug,” she said. “That’s cheating.”“It wasn’t just that night,” I defended. “I’d been in a process for months,seeking and researching, struggling to find some answers. I had put it out tothe universe that this was what I was looking for. Taking the MDMA was likeArchimedes taking a hot bath before his eureka moment. It gave me the space torelax and receive the intentions I had put out into the world.”“Still,” she argued. “It’s really, really dangerous.”“I know it’s not the best way to do things, but it opened me up to a spiritualperspective. I would never be in this class if it weren’t for MDMA.”“Maybe you don’t need to be in class anymore.” She dropped her voice in a waythat made this sound like an order.She walked down the last steps, waited for me to come outside, and then lockedthe door behind me.I gave up on the kundalini classes after that and struggled with the exercisesat home for several weeks until Jade, Rena, and I attended Playa del Fuego,Burning Man’s Mid-Atlantic festival for the Memorial Day weekend. This event wasa poor, smaller Xerox copy of Burning Man’s gigantic art cars, sprawling themecamps, and monolithic fire sculptures. Set at the Vietnam Veteran’s MotorcycleClub in Odessa, Delaware, the several hundred attendees displayed littleartistic vision, setting up a few communal tents with cheap rope lights sopeople could party on the club’s large lawn.I had once thought that Burning Man’s ideals of radical self-expression, leaveno trace, and gift economies could save the world. But considering the rampantpublic drunkenness, this festival might well be mistaken for spring break inFort Lauderdale, although the costumes here were better. It didn’t help thatlocal bikers with ZZ Top beards, Harley-Davidson shirts, and American flagbandanas hooted and whistled at each female they saw wearing plush pasties orbedazzled panties.Perhaps Jade, Rena, and I were no better than everyone else, taking MDMA to stayup late and dance. Ecstasy was a party drug after all—one that kundaliniteachers apparently hated. Jade and Rena glittered their faces with silver eyeshadow for Saturday night’s festivities. Jade wore a long purple queen’s coatwith golden paisleys and a fake diamond tiara; Rena, a sparkly white dress withher straw Native American hat. I had on a brown suede vest, leather pants,cowboy hat, and my silver-flamed boots.Jade requested that we stop first at the Gnome Adoption Agency, one of the onlytheme camps on the premises, to adopt a lawn ornament with a red hat, whitebeard, yellow overalls, and green pail. The camp hosts, dressed in red droopyhats of their own, gave us a disposable camera to record our adventures, whichcould be downloaded to their website after the festival. Jade cuddled the gnomein her arms like a baby, calling us “the starter family,” and nestled close tome as we perused the sites. While using the Porta Potty, I accidentally droppedthe gnome on the floor, cracking its head in half. I scrambled to pick up thepieces so that I could glue them together later, but I knew that wouldn’tappease Jade and that, once again, I had let her down.“Jonny, you killed our baby!” she yelled without any trace of humor when Ishowed her the fractured gnome. Her brow curled, making her face look old andangry. “You’re always doing this to us! I can’t trust you to come through onanything. You can’t support us. I had to buy the tickets to the festival, andyou’re wasting all your time on that Jesus stuff when you should be looking fora job. You can’t even take care of a starter family. What if we wanted a realfamily someday?”“I’m sorry my journey’s been so inconvenient for you,” I shouted back. “I hopeone day something shakes your world up, and you begin to see there’s more to theuniverse than jobs and family.”I was already on edge, coming up on MDMA, and I breathed deeply to avert one ofmy bowling-ball panic attacks. Rena pulled Jade aside to console her. We slowlywalked to the center of the festival, where organizers prepared to burn a woodenpony that had been placed on a tall woodpile. Several women in black leatherpants and vests spun hissing balls of fire on chains as the opening act to theburn. Rena placed her hands on the back of Jade’s heart and transmitted soothingenergy into her body while the pony went up in flames. “Just let it go,” shewhispered, watching the smoke rise up toward the half moon in the sky. “Let itgo.”Jade’s spirit lifted after the burn, and she whisked us off to the nearest partycamp, where we danced to space aquarium electronica. We stayed for a couplehours with Jade occasionally flitting her eyes at the empty stripper pole onstage. “Should I do it?” she finally asked. We coaxed her, and she hopped up tothe pole, throwing off her queen’s jacket immediately. The crowd roared awakeand clambered toward the stage. Jade teased and turned around the pole, slowlytugging off her silver top and black silk pants, revealing a pink lace camisoleand Hello Kitty–imprinted panties. She leaped high onto the pole, slitheringback to the ground. I took pictures for her sex-advice blog, knowing she likedto post tantalizing (but not too tantalizing) images for her readers.An unexpected warm energy began to fill my heart as I watched Jade mischievouslywink at different members of the audience. I breathed the pleasing vibrationsthrough my shoulders, abdomen, and legs, loosening up tension in each part. Irealized much of this energy was coming from Rena standing next to me, who musthave vibrated at a higher level than I did. For the next few minutes, I let myauric field fill with these soothing waves until I sucked in a big breathe ofair, taking in as much energy as my lungs could handle.“JONNY, STOP!” Rena pinched my arm.“Stop what?” I asked.“Stop that. It’s not safe! You can fry your whole field if you overdo it. Youshould already know that.” She pushed me aside and walked closer to the stage. Ilessened my inhalations, but didn’t see what harm a little breathing could do.On stage, Jade straddled the pole, spreading her legs (and Hello Kitty) to theworld. A middle-aged couple in matching faux-zebra jackets passed behind us. Ioverheard the woman sniff while glaring at Jade, “God, I hate Burner decadence.”Jade danced until her legs couldn’t take any more, then we stayed up latedrinking, chatting, and laughing until we finally dragged ourselves to the tent.While Jade slept next to me, I soaked up the golden energy still sifting throughmy lungs. I took deeper and deeper breaths. Pneuma rushed in and out of mybody’s energetic circuitry, my bluish-green aura ballooning out around me. Ikept gasping for more air, expanding my field until I felt something strange,something foreign, move at the base of my spine.Like a rattlesnake stirring in the weeds, a thin line of energy violentlyunwrapped its flapping tail from my sacrum. This creature had a feral, untamableintelligence, its energy a dangerous live wire of swerving electricity. Was thiskundalini? Whatever it was, it rapidly swung up to my root chakra, paused, thenquickly penetrated the energy center at my pelvis. My breath seized, and I layfrozen as this fiery whip of searing energy crawled up my spinal column on itsown accord, igniting each chakra until it reached the underside of my scalp.A troubling cacophony of voices spoke to me; I saw a billion eyes and earsspiraling out in fractal patterns across the universe, witnessing the story ofcreation. A fountain of sparking white light opened up above my head, and as Iwas about to enter it, I heard the familiar voice from my ayahuasca journey ask,“Cowboy, are you sure you want to go there?” Once again, I didn’t know what thispresence was, where it came from, or if it was just a manifestation of my ownmind. But I was beginning to trust it more after seeing energy fields and havingsuch a healing journey on ayahuasca. Still, I didn’t understand why it couldn’treveal itself if it was here to help.I panicked. The danger of the situation became immediately clear. I had readthat yogis spent their entire lives expanding and strengthening their energeticand nervous systems to handle the high-voltage frequencies of a full kundaliniawakening. I had been practicing only a couple of months, and here I was usingthe artificial accelerator of MDMA to push my auric body way beyond its naturallimits. If this electric serpent pierced my crown chakra, I riskedshort-circuiting my body, burning out the pranic valves.“Are you sure you want to go there?” the voice asked again.“No!” I shouted, although it may have been only in my mind because Jade stilllay there undisturbed.I dug my hands into the cool, plastic tent floor, fumbling to ground the pulsingcurrent the best I could. The snake aggressively tried to poke up into my violetseventh chakra, but I felt the presence stepping in to sprinkle cool waves on myhead, slowly coaxing the serpent power down my spine bit by bit. “Easy, easy,”the voice eventually charmed the fiery animal back to its home in my sacrum,although its tail trembled excitedly, waiting for its next strike.My auric field vibrated recklessly, and I remained still and terrified until thefirst signs of dawn when I shook Jade awake, telling her I was having troublecoming down. Although exhausted, she could see I was in a bad state, and she puton her clothes to take me outside. Jade had a nurturing quality about her inmoments like these. She held my hand in her pocket with hers to keep it warm.Outside, a gaseous yellow blob circled above the maple trees in the distance. Iwatched the strange hovering cloud for several minutes until I recognized a hawkunderneath the colorful smog. I was now seeing auras in their full intensity.The frenetic zigzagging rainbows of the festival’s early-morning risers jarredmy mind even more.Near center stage, drummers circled around the dying embers from last night’sburning pony, pounding out staccato rhythms to the rising sun. Long indigofingers crawled toward us from across the Delaware flatlands, and a ferociousglobe of red pushed up over the horizon. The red turned angry and orange,pulsating warmth onto the earth. I could see the powerful moving waves, complextextures, and wild flares of the massive energy being we call the sun.I packed the car immediately upon returning to camp. Rena heard us and begantaking down her tent. Still recovering from last night, she didn’t notice myfractured state. As I was about to shut the trunk, I spotted the broken gnomelying on top of Jade’s suitcase. Staring at its jagged crown, I paused: I hadalmost done the same thing to myself. Ignoring Rena’s warning, I had pushed mybreathing on MDMA too far, inviting a potential catastrophe. I picked up thegnome and stared into its blank eyes, then tossed it in a garbage can with awhiff of regret. By now, the glowing auras had faded, and I had no concern aboutgetting behind the wheel of the car. I just wanted to get home, but I droveslowly, in no rush. I was happy simply to be in my body, with my mind more orless intact."},{"pageContent":"[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_015_r1.jpg]WHEN DOVES FLY[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_L02_r1.jpg]THE HOMELESS DOMINICAN STEPPED onto the L train at Union Square and came rightat me. He had already barked like a husky at the closing metal doors, andshouted at an invisible cop over his shoulder, “I didn’t steal them meters,officer!” As if he had some kind of internal tracking radar, his eyes lockedonto mine. Wearing an insulated camouflage jumpsuit and dirty black hoodie, anoutfit too hot for late spring, he staggered my way, preceded by the smell ofurine.“You think you know the James, but you don’t know her!” The muscles in his facedistorted as if competing personalities fought for control when he talked. “TheJames is here, and she ain’t stopping the boat!” His skin was olive and he wasimpressively handsome for someone living on the streets. But the brownish halo Inoticed around his head jerked from side to side, as if it were at war withitself. Staring me down, he screamed, “The James, she’s all that!”I decided to get off at the next stop and take the long walk home over theWilliamsburg Bridge. Apparently, subways weren’t safe for me anymore. In Prague,my Scottish barfly friend Alastair once said that you’re allowed two crazypeople a week, but when a third one shows up, you had better look in the mirror.This was my third bizarro subway encounter since getting back from Playa delFuego. All week, the kundalini serpent still vibrated in my sacrum, threateninganother attempt at rocket launch, while my aura oscillated wildly, acting likecatnip to New York’s mentally imbalanced veterans, homeless, and schizophrenics.I think I started to understand why Jesus, the pneumatic healer, cleared out therebellious voices and demons that plagued people and rebalanced their energyfields, changing their vibrations to match our consensual reality.Depressed after the long, anxious schlep over the bridge, I called asking Jadeto come over and take care of me. I told her I was feeling fluish after ourweekend away. She brought Campbell’s tomato soup, rented a romantic comedy, andlaid a woolen blanket over me. She held me with an unusually tight grip on theleather couch, as if I might slip away from her. I still hadn’t told her aboutmy near kundalini awakening, and I was glad she didn’t ask.While Jade took a shower, I sat on the edge of my bed. Staring at the glossyfloorboards, I felt a current of cool, dense energy rise up from below my feetand circle my ankles, tickling my toes. I concentrated on opening the tinychakras on the soles, connecting with this grounding vibration coming up fromthe earth. Humbled by my latest blunder, I quietly asked the planet forforgiveness. I had disrespected and underestimated her kundalini power. I hadlet my desire for transcendental experience nearly push me over the edge ofsanity. I prayed for her to take away this pulsating energy, to save me fromthis frightening new force, to have mercy on her wayward child. After severalminutes of this, hot energy began sliding down the pranic valves in my legs,draining into the ground. My thighs and calves cooled off dramatically until thekundalini pulse quieted and gently disappeared.A wave of relief overcame me instantly. I thanked Mother Earth for her help, andfor having patience, for still caring for me even after all the times I didn’trecycle plastic bottles, wasted water with long showers, or spewed carbondioxide into her atmosphere through air travel. I asked her to forgive us humansand to continue loving us even though we are recklessly destroying her WorldTree of Life. Over past millennia, the patriarchal aggression of civilizationhad killed off the serpent goddess, the Gaian force that had sustained life onearth for four billion years. My naive hope that kundalini awakenings wouldelevate humanity to a Christ-consciousness-based utopia crashed when Iunderstood the danger involved in unleashing its raw power. But given thecurrent rate of species extinction, our planetary support systems didn’t havemuch time left.I sat in quiet meditation until I heard a tiny whisper infiltrate my thoughts,“You know, cowboy, there’s a safer way.”“And what’s that?” I asked the familiar voice. This was the first time the voicespoke to me without my having ingested a mind-altering substance—a fact thatworried me somewhat. Was I imagining voices? Wasn’t that the clinical definitionof schizophrenia? I looked around the room for some clue where this presencemight be hiding, but I didn’t see a thing. I waited for an answer to myquestion, but the voice didn’t respond. Whatever this spirit or disturbed mentalprojection was, it had a coy and frustrating way of popping into my life andthen vanishing again without ever making itself visible.A week later, I stopped at a local pharmacy, a small Puerto Rican shop on thesouth end of Havemeyer Street, and noticed for the first time two double-helixsnakes pretzeling around a central rod on the store’s green awning. This icon,the ancient caduceus, included another important feature I had completelyoverlooked—a pair of white symmetrical wings at the top. I had passed by thisimage dozens of times and never gave it a thought.I then realized just how frequently serpents with wings (or with birds) wererepresented in various cultures, especially in the vicinity of the Tree of Life.In fact, this universal symbol associated with kundalini energy seemed to turnup everywhere, once I started to look for it. North American indigenous peoplespoke of the snake and the eagle, while in Middle and South America, theyrevered the serpent and the condor. The plumed-serpent god Quetzalcoatl fromboth the Mayan and Aztec cosmologies represented the sacred energy of life thatfashioned the universe. In Chinese mythology, a dragon and a phoenix guarded thetreasures of the Tree of Life, while Norse legend told of the serpent Nidhogg atthe tree’s base and an eagle perched on top. Ancient Egypt had a slew of mythicwinged serpents, including the four-winged snake god Chanuphis and the WingedGlobe of Egypt—the insignia of the Egyptian Trinity (Amon, Ra, and Osiris), theforerunner of the Christian Holy Trinity.In the Gospel of Thomas, the earliest known Christian gospel, Jesus says, “ThePharisees and the scholars have taken the keys of knowledge and have hiddenthem. They have not entered nor have they allowed those who want to enter to doso. As for you, be as sly as snakes and as simple as doves.” (11.2:39) A similarpassage appears in the synoptic Gospel of Matthew, ironically warning initiatesnot to reveal protected knowledge, while also hinting at one of the mysteryschools’ biggest secrets: “Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst ofwolves; so be shrewd as serpents and innocent as doves.” (10:16)While Gnostics spoke of the importance of uniting the right and the left, in theGospel of Thomas Jesus also discussed making the upper and the lower and maleand female into “a single one so that the male will not be male nor the femalebe female … then you will enter [the kingdom].” (11.2:22) The “lower” may havereferred to the ascending mother current of kundalini energy from the base ofthe spine, represented symbolically as a serpent; and the “upper” to the fathercurrent, the powerful pranic channel (portrayed by wings) descending down thebody’s Tree of Life from the crown chakra, circulating and balancing out thesestrong forces, rather than blasting kundalini out one’s scalp as I had almostdone. Perhaps this current was the “safer way” the presence spoke of in mybedroom.The Gnostic Hymn of the Pearl (also known as the Hymn of the Robe of Glory)offers a parable for mastering these dueling vertical currents. In the tale, aprince abandons his “glittering robe” (bright aura) and his father’s kingdom togo into Egypt (the material world) to obtain a pearl protected by “theloud-breathing serpent” (kundalini), after which he follows the “voice” and“light” of an eagle (the descending current) sent by his father, leading himhome to his “toga with brilliant hues.”In the Secret Book of John, Jesus interrupts the serpent’s temptation in theGarden by swooping down “in the form of an eagle on the tree of knowledge” tobring “pure light” and “awaken [Adam and Eve] out of the depth of sleep.” (11.1)A downward current of light also plays an important role in the New Testamentdescription of the baptism of Jesus: the skies tear open and “Spirit” (pneuma)comes down “like a dove” upon him. (Mark 1:10) Perhaps that’s why Jesus latertells the Judean leader Nicodemus, “No one can experience God’s imperial rulewithout being reborn from above.”15[Phil_9781583943434_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts015] (John 3:7) Jesus immediatelyfollows this advice with the resonant allusion to kundalini: “As Moses lifted upthe serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; so thatwhoever believes will in him have eternal life.” (John 3:14–15)As I read about the immense transcendental power of these two vertical currents,especially in the mystical Christian tradition, I wanted to explore them in amore careful way than I had done with my kundalini screwup. I already recognizedthat the early holders of gnosis had concerns about authoritarian structuresthat were similar to mine. Their spiritual oppressors were Sadducees, Pharisees,and Romans, while mine were the profiteering Halliburtons, angryfundamentalists, and warmongering neocons. Unlike my political prankstercohorts, the Gnostics seemed to have discovered a more effective route totransformation. If I wanted to overcome the archon-like energies of ourcorrupted political, religious, and economic systems, perhaps the answer didn’tlie solely in battling my corrupt nemeses. Maybe it also required me to turninward, safely activating my own latent power, mastering and balancing theforces of the right and the left, the upper and the lower, to access the highvibrations of the pleroma, the heavenly realms.One day, Nick called to see if I wanted to participate in his next ayahuascaceremony. Recalling the two golden eagles that rose up during my last journey,just before the snake king appeared, I told him, “Yes. I wouldn’t miss it.” Ihoped another round with the spirit vine might bring me close to the eagle’senergy, that allusive, all-important descending current. I also hoped to getbetter acquainted with the mysterious presence that kept appearing at dramaticmoments over the last few months. Perhaps this time it would show its face.Not wanting to stay in the city by herself for the weekend, Jade joined Tavisand me for our second journey with the spirit vine. “What if ayahuasca tells youto break up with me?” she said on the ride to the cabin we would be staying at.“I at least want to be there to tell her what I think.” Holding my hand in ourceremonial circle of Mexican blankets in the woods just north of the city, Jadeacted as if this was a romantic daytrip into the country, but I wasn’t sure thatspending time with one’s significant other was the best reason to blast off intomultidimensional frontiers. Jade did dress for the occasion, wearing a MuppetsTake Manhattan long-sleeved shirt that she hoped would invoke “fuzzy beings” onher ayahuasca travels. She had read the trip reports but discussed only oneconcern: the vomiting. “I don’t want people to see me hurling in the trees,” sherepeated that morning.Tavis sat on the other side of me, selecting her Brian Eno–inspired trip-list onher iPod. She wore Tomboy work overalls and a tan Buddha T-shirt underneath,digging her bare toes in the dirt like Huck Finn. I was still trying to catch mybreath from her Nascar-like approach to driving us up here. Her boyfriendMitchell was away researching places in Arizona to build an eco-retreat, wherehe and Tavis could “get off the grid and avoid the peak oil apocalypse.”The setting was an improvement over the dilapidated chicken cop in the IrishCatskills. Nick had rented a small cabin for the weekend outside of Chappaqua,the forested New York suburb where Bill and Hillary Clinton lived. Ten of us saton bright red and yellow Mexican blankets beneath a grove of large tulip trees,which offered a majestic green and brown canopy to protect us from the middaysun. I happily gummed one of Nick’s homemade ginger candies, looking forward towhat secrets the vine might reveal. Nick wore his mix of South American tribalclothes and Gap khakis. He had concocted horse-pill-sized ayahuasca pellets thatwe could chew to avoid the brew’s pungent taste.While waiting for the pellets to take effect, Wendy told me about Suluk Academy,the Sufi mystery school she had been attending at a former Shaker village in NewLebanon, New York. I didn’t know much about Sufis, other than that they liked tochant while dancing in circles. But Wendy explained that they pursued the samesacred knowledge as the early Christian mystics. “Jonny, I think it could bewhat you’re searching for. The Gnostics are gone, but the Sufis have stuckaround. Our teacher, Pir Zia Inayat-Khan, is a young guy like us, political too,but he transmits the vibrations of an ancient lineage. I can’t get into detailsof the initiations; we can’t speak of them, but I assure you they’re powerful.”Without question, her words caught my interest. So far I had only read aboutmystery schools. I wondered what it might be like to commit to one.Nick’s ayahuasca pellets landed like rocks in our stomachs. All ten members ofour circle puked within the first forty-five minutes. Jade left for the bushesseveral times. “Oh, my God, what if I don’t stop puking?” she fretted. After myfirst purge, as shamans delicately refer to the act of vomiting, I closed myeyes for a long time to calm the nausea. When I opened them again, Jade haddisappeared. By now, the medicine had kicked in. I walked down the hill vividlyaware that I was some type of spiritual essence inside a man’s body walkingtoward a cabin in the material world to find another spiritual essence that hada home inside a woman.I found Jade curled up on the cabin’s gray wooden porch. Her face looked pallid,greenish. Her hair was wet. The Muppets on her shirt were splattered in brownliquid. “I broke the toilet from puking so much,” she despaired. “It’s cancer.That’s why I’m throwing up.”“Jade, you think a headache’s cancer,” I started to laugh, but then stoppedmyself, seeing how upset she was.“The vine told me to get it all out, but I can’t. I’m puking air.”I helped Jade sit up straight, breathe deeply, and feel her sit bones sinkinginto the porch, grounding her energies. As strong as the ayahuasca was, I toldmyself I would forgo my journey to watch over her, but then my stomachcontracted like a pumping fist. I leaped off the porch into the nearbyunderbrush just in time to projectile vomit over the weeds. When I was done, Iheard the familiar presence from my last ayahuasca trip speak out of nowhere.“Cowboy, this is a ride you want to take, trust us.”“Us? I thought there was only one of you?” I said, concerned.Several invisible beings giggled around me. “We’re full of surprises.”“Why don’t you show yourselves so I know who you are?”They ignored my request and began to hum soft, high-pitched melodies, creatingfantastic blue and magenta hexagonal shapes with their voice frequencies. Thesebeautiful shapes playfully danced around me. Convinced that something importantwas about to happen, I walked back over to Jade and told her that I needed toclose my eyes for my journey.“Jonny, don’t leave me here. I think I’m going to die.”“That’s sometimes how vision quests are; they’re tough. You’ll get through itand I’ll be back soon, but I’m being called to do this.”The beings hummed louder, increasing the colors of the elaborate honeycombpatterns. Somehow I knew they used these designs as camouflage so I couldn’t seetheir real form.“Who are you guys?” I asked.“Who do you think we are?” they laughed. “We’re your guides. We’ve been tryingto connect with you for a long time—so crack open the champagne. This is ourreunion tour!” they celebrated.Kissing Jade on the cheek, I sat down cross-legged with my back alignedstraight. When I closed my eyes, rainbow-colored confetti exploded all aroundme. The beings hummed louder, more joyfully, sending the hexagonal frequenciesinto me. Even with my eyes shut, I could see these vibrations transforming thedarker energetic areas of my auric field into a bright and healing crystallineblue light. Reunion tour, indeed. These entities showed me moments from my lifewhen they had visited me before—when I was hiding under the covers from mymother’s rage, and they helped me fall asleep; when I drunkenly consideredsuicide by jumping off Prague’s medieval Charles Bridge, and a tiny voice saidto me, “Stick it out;” the night I downloaded the whole idea for Greene Dragonduring a TV-turn-off week flash mob in Times Square.These frolicking spirits giggled around me like disincarnate Dalai Lamas, sweet,whimsical, and playful. It figures that my guides—if that’s what they reallyare—would be gentle pranksters. Tears of happiness streaked down my cheeks assome part of me seemed to recognize that I had waited a long time to reacquaintmyself with this invisible crew.“Okay, we’ve only got a short time here,” they said. “You are in for a trip sowonderful your human ego isn’t going to believe it.”With those words, a blinding light opened up above me, descending into my crownchakra, filling my entire body with energy. It was what I had imagined earlyChristian baptisms to be. A pink lotus flower rose up from underneath me,lifting me into the air. Its petals unfolded when entering the potent, beautifullight. White energy gushed through my meridians, pumping pleasant sensationsthrough my body. I was charged to the point of being overwhelmed. I had enteredthis journey hoping to connect to these beings and access the descending fathercurrent. Not only was it happening, but I had never experienced anything soecstatic. Yet it felt safe, as if I couldn’t possibly blow out myspiritual-electrical system under their tutelage.“Welcome home, cowboy,” the guides said. “Here’s the answer to your questionabout humanity’s meandering journey out of Eden.” They giggled and hummed outmore blue and indigo geometric patterns to add suspense. “What you’re nowfeeling is the Jesus, Buddha, Krishna energy you’ve been looking for. It’strue—humans can become enlightened. In fact, you all already are. You’ve justforgotten, and it’s time to remember.”The descending current continued to pour soothing light down into my scalp. Myguides instructed me to soak up this vibration, to “remember how it feels andremember who you truly are.” They said this wasn’t a quest for my head, but onefor my heart. My body undulated as I absorbed the light within my cells. Iwondered if people could access this illuminated state on a permanent basis, andif this was the paradigm shift I had been seeking—a human race that could returncontinually to its connection to the source.Suddenly, a jagged slice of pain and darkness cut through the light like aserrated knife into my abdomen. An urge to look down immediately overcame me.Far below, perhaps miles down the stem of the lotus flower, I could see thesmall image of a frail Egyptian-looking woman, bloody and mangled, beingtortured in a dusty brown cell with strange wooden and metal devices scatteredaround her. “She was you a long time ago,” the spirits whispered to me. “Hersuffering created the dark seed for your lotus flower to grow.”“But how can people be so cruel?” I yelled back. My outrage surprised me, makingme consider the possibility that this image did represent a past life. “How cana loving God allow things like that to happen?”“Cowboy, it’s hard for everyone, including the perpetrators. It’s not easy totake on shadow incarnations. Your job is to hold a candle in their darkness.Always remember the light. That’s why you’ve come here, to bring light to thosewho need it the most, even those who torture.”With those words, a terrible blast of light flashed across my vision, forcing myeyes to open to the woods around me. I saw Jade crouched over the porch steps,whimpering, with brown saliva dripping out of her mouth. Before I could walkover to her, the beings told me to remain still. “Your left arm will go numb fora minute,” they said, which it immediately did, falling limp at my side. I hadthe strange sense that I was sitting on some multidimensional operating table. Ithought I heard some kind of buzzing, like a drill or a surgical tool, and Isensed a tickling just above my left elbow. A strange, luminescent green bug,shaped like a tiny futuristic helicopter, lifted from the porch and slowlyhovered across my chest toward my droopy arm. It circled toward the spot thatwas being worked on. When it landed, my elbow moved again, and the bug instantlyvanished. As I nervously understood it, these entities had implanted some typeof tracking device under my skin.“This will make it easier for us to stay in touch,” they said.“Where are you guides from?” I asked uneasily, suddenly remembering the word“alien” that they had given me on the night I started seeing energy.“All in good time,” they said. “We’ll meet soon.”But I wasn’t ready for that. Were they really guides helping me navigate my pathback to the light, perhaps ascended healing masters visiting from anotheradvanced off-planet civilization? Maybe they were simply cosmic biologiststracking a foreign species through its natural territory or, even worse,abductor types winning my trust to later kidnap me to their homeland. Of course,the most logical explanation was that they were mere hallucinations brought onby Nick’s questionable ayahuasca pellets.As I stood up and walked over to Jade, I heard them say, “There’s one last thingtoday. Say hi to Rena. Like you, she’s one of us.”“One of what?” I asked, but by then I could sense that they were gone.I helped Jade carefully to her feet and held her up as we walked back up thehill to the camp. I handed her my water bottle and gave her ginger candy toclear the taste of vomit from her mouth. She was still sobbing quietly, and Irocked her gently from behind, humming the healing songs the self-proclaimedguides had sung to me. Whether they existed or not, I couldn’t deny the blissfulenergy flowing through my body."},{"pageContent":"[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_016_r1.jpg]REPTILES IN SPACE SUITS?[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_L02_r1.jpg]THE BURNERS HAD DRAPED PINK AND ORANGE Day-Glo fabric from the ceiling of themidtown club. On stage, up-and-coming DJs showcased their talents to recordlabel execs. The playa bunnies, glitter fairies, and Mad Max hipsters contrastedstarkly with the suit-and-tie regulars at the bar. Rena, Jade, and I had allingested MDMA, and I sat with Rena in the back booth, wearing my new blackcowboy hat with blinking gold flames. It had been only a couple of weeks sincethe last ayahuasca ceremony, so I was kicking back, taking it easy. For thefirst few days following the journey, Jade cried intermittently, claiming shewas grieving part of her childhood and her parents’ inability to love her fully.I floated around my janitorial job at Eyebeam, basking in some mysticalafterglow from the trip. Within a week, we were back to our normal selves, butsomehow felt happier together, as if the ayahuasca had dropped unnecessary cargothat had previously burdened our relationship.While Jade bounced wildly under the speakers in a lime green crinoline skirt,plush bra, and aviator goggles, Rena passed the time by reading me the auras ofthe Burners in the room.“The Buddha dancing on stilts is a blue mischief-maker. The whooping black angelon stage, a white witch. The mermaid with butterfly wings ordering tequilashots, a magenta healer—although she doesn’t realize it yet. And Jade, as youknow, is blue-green trouble with a capital T.”“Rena, what are we?” I asked, remembering how my guides on the aya journey hadclaimed that she was one of us.“I can’t see my own aura.” She drew her hands across her Whitesnake T-shirt andbrushed back her red ponytail.“Travelers, cowboy,” I heard the beings from my journey whisper in my ear.“You’re both travelers.”Back at Rena’s place, the girls petted the three cats on the couch obsessively.The ecstasy made their fur thrilling to touch. I meditated on Rena’s smallliving room rug, positioning her many amethyst and quartz crystals around me. Myfield slowly lit up with energy. I kept breathing softly, feeling the lightvibrations open my chest until a plasma cloud of energy formed around my hands.My palms suddenly began to move in circles by themselves, pushing energy up intomy heart center, which I saw glowing light green. I found myself chanting,“Ommm, ommm, ommm,” but as I listened closer, I realized I was actually saying,“Home, home, home.”My hands moved in slow tai chi curves, bringing more pneuma to my heart andraising my aura’s vibration. Then they dropped and curled behind me, resting onthe floor. The cloud of energy disappeared from my palms, and with my eyesclosed I observed three long, extremely skinny, and obviously nonhuman fingerstouching the back of my hands. My throat seized up. The fingers didn’t go away,and I focused my intention on them, trying to absorb what this might mean.“Alien,” I stuttered, recalling the word given to me during my first encounterwith the presence.“I think I get what you’re showing me,” I said to the presence. “But that’senough. This is freaking me out.”The fingers vanished and the plasma cloud returned around my hands, as my armsswooped forward and brought more prana to my fourth chakra.“Let’s go, Jonny. This is getting weird,” Jade said.The green light from their invisible fingers continued to funnel high-frequencygreen energy into my chest. Although edgy about these beings’ planetary origins,I found their activities deliciously healing. And admittedly, this new aliensituation intrigued me on a level I couldn’t comprehend.Rena and Jade retreated to the tiny bedroom to talk. The guides continued theirenergy work for half an hour until I heard Jade yell for us to go, but I didn’trespond. She yelled again, and then I heard her crying. Rena stormed out andgrabbed my swerving hands. “That’s enough, Jonny! You’ve forgotten the mostimportant rule of all—being present with the people here, in this dimension!”Jade didn’t talk to me on the cab ride back to her apartment. I crawled in bednext to her curvy naked body and stared at the pink and lime green Disneyposters on the gray walls. The sun was already coming up, but I couldn’t sleep,unable to shake the disorienting alien encounter, if that’s what it was, andstill feeling some of the effects of the MDMA. The green energy in my heartstill pulsated brightly, and I put my stumpy human fingers over my heart,feeling its rapid rhythm, saying to myself, “That really happened, right?” But Ireally didn’t know.Without the slightest warning, Jade flopped on top of me and began grinding herpelvis into mine with a manic force beyond sensual desire. It was more like anattack. Her hips struck at my weak second chakra. I moaned from the pain in myabdomen, but she only thrust harder, pinning me down. Her legs pounded back andforth like a crocodile wrestling me under water. She didn’t appear aware of anyof this, but rather was in some type of violent trance or spell—or maybe it wasa force or spirit, I considered, that she was somehow channeling. My eyes grewmoist, and I began to get angry. “She’s my queen,” I growled inexplicably,inhaling large gulps of prana as she pounded down on me. “She’s my queen!” Iyelled. Even as the words crossed my lips, I wondered where they came from.Jade’s eyes remained closed, and she kept grinding and swinging her hips like aravenous crocodile.Finally, I let out a gut-wrenching roar. Energy surged through my system, and Ithrew Jade off with strength I didn’t know I had in my skinny runner’s body.Jade just turned on her side and snored, as if nothing had happened. I lay theretrying to absorb the absurdity of the experience. Pneuma swelled throughout myenergy field and, as crazy as it seemed, I felt as if I was channeling in thesame powerful entity that Jade had just used against me. In my aura, I couldsomehow sense the form of a big, reptilian astral creature with throbbingmuscles and scales (yes, I could feel the scales). This thing was tough, strong,and armored like a crocodile, but also had some human-like qualities such aselongated arms and legs. I don’t know how I sensed this; I just sort ofdid—which I didn’t trust at all. I had already been down the rabbit hole ofseeing energy fields and meeting invisible talking “guides,” but now I waschanneling (or shape-shifting into) a creature from the Black Lagoon. This wastoo much.As I breathed and grounded my energy, feeling the invisible muscles and scalesfade away, the plasma cloud of energy from my meditation that night returnedaround my hands. My right palm swooped down to my second chakra, the left to myheart. Then I heard a chorus of voices from my immediate family. It was a fight.My father and sister were complaining that my mother and brother were bullies,and my mother and brother shouted back that the rest of us were wimps who neededto toughen up—the usual fault lines of our family dynamic. But in this case, thepurported guides from my last ayahuasca ceremony rushed in as negotiators. Theyentered like the cavalry at the end of a John Ford western. The bickering voicessubsided as the entities explained that my family came from two diverse galacticlineages.“You’re telling me my whole family is alien?” I argued back in disbelief,somehow not waking Jade.“You’ve come from more places than just that, cowboy,” the beings giggled. “Timeis an illusion and the universe is vast, so start opening to possibilities.”“Okay, let’s just pretend this is true. So what?”“Your father, your sister, and you come from a heart-centered race. Your motherand brother are from a feuding, second-chakra Reptilian line. Your family agreedto incarnate together on this planet to learn from and forgive each other.Cowboy, you’re the bridge between these two cultures,” they informed me. “Yourjourney is about balancing these energies and creating union. That’s whatholistic means—including everyone, even those you hate.”“If my brother and mom really do come from a race of reptilian aliens—which, forthe record, I highly doubt—what about my sister, my dad, and me?”“One surprise at a time,” they said. “For now, we have a mission for you. Yourmom and brother want you to take care of Jade, who’s from their lineage, andhelp her find her spiritual path. That’s your karmic contract,” they said.“Even if all this cosmic mumbo-jumbo is real, Jade doesn’t even care aboutmystical stuff.”“All the more reason,” they giggled joyfully.“Fine,” I mumbled. “I’ll give it a shot, but you guys need to show yourselvessometime if you expect me to keep this up.”“Stay in touch,” their voices faded and the plasma cloud vanished around myhand.Finally I had some privacy to consider all that had happened that evening. Inone MDMA experience, I saw not just my worldview but my entire universe-view—ifthere was such a thing—crash on its reptilian, shape-shifting head. Were aliensmore than flying-saucer joyriders watching us from afar? Could they bemultidimensional prankster healers interceding in the 3-D drama being played outon earth? Were they manifestations of spiritual energy and the mysticalexperience? Was my ingestion of psychotropic substances opening a portal for meto receive downloads from the pleroma, or was it perhaps rewiring my brain indangerous ways?I didn’t know what to think about the explanation of my family members comingfrom different galactic lines. Perhaps it was literally true or maybe justenergetically accurate in how we behaved with each other. But how could I admitthe basic validity of certain information, while staying grounded in thematerial world? I know that the human mind can grasp only so much. What seems tomatter is how we integrate and act on the leads we get from the astral plane—tobe open to the messages, while maintaining our own unique discernment and nottaking anything as absolute fact.After that night, I ordered an array of books about extraterrestrials thatclaimed that archon-like reptiles—who were in league with some mean, big-eyed,ET-looking, gray aliens—interfered with human events. I found it surprising howmany books there were on the subject.In The Pleiadian Agenda, Barbara Hand Clow wrote about a reptilian “WorldManagement Team” that controls our thoughts through low-frequency subliminalmessages in the media. David Icke, author of The Biggest Secret and Children ofthe Matrix, argued that nefarious illuminati of Anunnaki lizards from the fourthdimension once held the reins of empires and that the scaly bloodlines oftoday’s political and economic rulers can be traced back to these domineeringkings and queens of ancient civilizations.In Bringers of the Dawn, Pleiadian-channel Barbara Marciniak wrote about reptileCreator gods (“Lizzies” as the Pleiadians humorously called them) who raided theearth, rearranged our DNA to limit our field’s frequency band, and put a“frequency fence” around the planet, blocking out divine light so they couldfeed off our negative emotions. According to Marciniak, humans today are the“guardians of light” who incarnated with the mission to receive the highvibrations of the heavens and usher in a kinder, gentler era on our planet. Ican’t say I believed or even understood what all these books claimed, but theydid make for entertaining and sometimes scary reading, and they provided amusingmental exercises to stretch my imagination in new cosmic directions.Once I started down the alien path, no byway seemed too outlandish toinvestigate. My recent experiences had turned my ontology on its head—it felt asif anything was possible. I trolled the fringes of the Internet looking forclues that resonated with me, willing to consider any assertion, at least forfifteen minutes. For example, I read the blog of a self-proclaimed Sirianchannel, who wrote that she faced down the psychic attack of a Draco, “a greenscaled reptile with yellow slitted [sic] eyes wearing a one piece space suit” bycalling on “the Office of Christ.” Aliens and Christ? That’s a connection Ihadn’t considered. The channel’s online portrait reminded me of Sheryl Crow—LAblond wavy hair, perfect thin nose, and an almost unnaturally wide smile—but hertone was straight drill sergeant. “They’ve put an energy fence around theplanet. Our mission is to receive the light pulsated in by the IntergalacticFederation. The Dracos can illuminate with us in this ascension process, orwe’ll send them back home.”This was the mother of all conspiracy theories! As crazy as it seemed, Icouldn’t entirely dismiss it. I knew that my reptile encounter was more than anMDMA hallucination. Moreover, in some of the ancient Gnostic reports I had read,the world-dominating archons bore a disturbing resemblance to the sci-firhetoric of the purported Pleiadian and Sirian channels. The Gnostics oftenspoke of demonic ruling forces that manipulated humans to serve them, blockingout the pleroma’s healing light and feeding off our misery. In a sense, they hadformed a type of “World Management Team” that trapped the earth in darkness,including the fallen goddess Sophia. Recognizing the bleakness of the situation,the angelic beings known as aeons plotted a rescue operation: Jesus smuggled inthe liberating power of “the Epinoia of pure light” under the archons’ radar (or“frequency fence” as Barbara Marciniak called it) to bring Sophia (and Adam andEve) back to their home in the “Treasury of Light.”Most Gnostics considered the archons beyond redemption, but there was onemystic, the second-century leader Valentinus, who believed that even these darkruling forces could find illumination. Valentinus had already been a hero in myreading, a spiritual secret agent who used his position in the literalist RomanChurch (he almost became pope) to expose initiates to the secrets of gnosis.Understanding Jesus as a soter (“one who makes whole”), Valentinus embraced anintegrated perspective where even the most depraved and lost archon could findsalvation. His approach had some significance to me. If I were to humor thepossibility that half my family as well as my girlfriend came from archon-likeancestry, I at least wanted to believe that they could transform into kinder,gentler beings.I also wanted to make some sense of my own identity. Am I really an alien? Ifso, what planet am I from? What am I doing on this big rock called Earth? Whatstruck me most about all this talk of aliens was the notion that some part ofme, an aspect of my soul, might have roots in another star system; that Earth isonly one planet among many that sentient beings inhabit; and that from onelifetime to the next, we might relocate from one planet to another. I was partScottish, German, and English. Perhaps I also had some Pleiadian, Sirian, Draco,and Andromedean in me as well.It’s a remarkable experience to ask yourself identity-crisis questions from acomic book movie with a mostly straight face, but I don’t recommend it. I livedthrough a couple of absurd, disorienting weeks. I kept imagining my familyengaging in an interstellar drama during the banality of meatloaf dinners,household chores, and rides home from basketball practice. Just thinking aboutthis made me dizzy.During meditations, I asked the giggling voices for clarification, but theyremained silent. I drifted into muddled confusion. My murkiness led me toquestion the veracity of these “guides” and whether they were indeed the alliesI thought they were. They could have been trickster spirits messing with me, anunsuspecting novice entering labyrinthine astral planes.Who could I talk to about this? I called Rena to see if she had ever seen or hadcontact with ETs, but she told me that she never even thought about them. Evenmore maddening, Jade had no recollection of writhing madly against my pelvisthat morning. “I fell right asleep when we got home,” she told me over a dim sumbrunch in Chinatown.For solace, I went back to the Chapel of Sacred Mirrors. I couldn’t stopthinking about one of Alex Grey’s paintings. Perhaps it held some answers forme. Called Cosmic Christ, it was a beautiful, complex painting tucked in theback of the church’s “black room.” The painting features a futuristic Jesuswhose head and torso are formed out of jagged energy grids of orange and yellowflames. A cross sits at the savior’s third eye, stormy galaxies swirl in hiscorneas, a computer-generated vortex swooshes in his crown chakra, and the earthis placed at his heart topped by the head of a crying green baby, suggesting apainful birthing process. Angelic healing figures appear both above and belowthe globe, channeling in holy light to a smaller figure of Jesus, who assiststhis planetary awakening in his human form.Within the energy lines on the left side, Grey depicts the accomplishments andcrimes of humanity—a space shuttle launch, tube-like satellite dishes orbitingin space, marching armies of the Third Reich, bursting nuclear mushrooms, anddark factories belching soot and decimating landscapes. In the frames on theright, religious icons are highlighted including Gandhi, Mother Teresa, andMartin Luther King, Jr. Scenes from the story of Jesus also appear, but with aStar Trek twist. For the birth in the manger, a glowing spaceship is substitutedfor the North Star, zapping Mary with a light beam with a dove flying alongside.The resurrection takes place before two astonished disciples, who gape at abug-eyed alien head anachronistically sticking out of Christ’s traditional whiterobe.Grey wasn’t the first religious painter to include science fiction imagery inhis Christian canvases. The practice goes back at least to the Renaissance. InDomenico Ghirlandaio’s fifteenth-century painting The Madonna with SaintGiovannino, a metal disk-shaped object with portholes hovers above Mary’s leftshoulder. At the Visoki Decani Monastery in Kosovo, a fresco entitled TheCrucifixion by an unknown artist from 1350 features a human figure flying adomed object with rockets shooting out the back on each side of the cross. Dutchartist Aert de Gelder (1645–1727) included a large, odd-looking disk beaminglight down onto John the Baptist and Jesus in his painting The Baptism ofChrist.I sat cross-legged in front of Grey’s work, recalling what I had recently readabout the Axial Age. German philosopher Karl Jaspers coined the term to describethe period from 800 to 200 BC, which he believed was a critical epoch thatframed our religious and philosophical foundations. The great teachers of thattime—Confucius, Buddha, Lao Tzu, Zarathustra, and Jesus (who is included in thislist by scholars who extend the age by two hundred years)—had strikingsimilarities in their philosophies despite their isolation from each othergeographically. For example, all preached the importance of the Golden Rule:treat others as you would have others treat you. As I looked at Grey’s painting,I wondered if these teachers—be they mythical archetypes or flesh-and-bonehumans—were a kind of cosmic Special Forces unit, sent from outer space to ourworld of illusion to bring knowledge of high-vibrational power. Perhaps theywere only securing the beachhead, and now finally the rest of us were waking upto our mission as celestial marines assigned to expand consciousness on thisplanet.While taking in Cosmic Christ, I came upon a critical realization: this AxialAge–induced awareness (and its potential galactic inclinations) might revolvearound the gnosis that occurs when one activates the heart center. That was thepurpose of the golden rule after all—to learn to express compassion for othersand oneself. Among the many images depicted in Grey’s canvas, there is onestriking small portrait of Jesus with energy pouring down through his crown andup through his root chakra to form a luminous star tetrahedron (a merkaba)emanating from his heart. In yogic teachings, I learned that two intersectingtriangles—which form a two-dimensional star tetrahedron and a six-pointed Starof David—produce the sacred geometry of the fourth chakra. This figurerepresents the sacred marriage of matter and spirit, earth and heaven, masculineand feminine, the above and below, and the right and the left—allowing two tobecome one. Staring at the merkaba that Grey had painted at Christ’s heart, Irealized that the heart served as the center point and pneumatic unifier of thediverse energy currents I had been studying. My heart was the balancingmechanism and energy converter I had been looking for.Gnostics revered the sacred marriage of the “bridal chamber,” which may havereferred to the alchemical integration of opposing forces by an activated heart,as the final rite of initiation. According to the Gospel of Philip, the bridalchamber is “The Holy of the Holies,” where Jesus made “the things below like thethings above, and the things outside like those inside. I came to unite them inthe place.” (11.3) Perhaps this was the meaning behind the glowing red flames ofthe Sacred Heart of Jesus seen in images throughout Christian cultures. Toobtain enlightenment and witness the kingdom of heaven, one had to illuminatethis power center, the median point of the seven primary chakras.Like Grey’s painting, a number of Renaissance alchemical engravings featuredilluminated two- or three-dimensional merkabas. They often sat glowing in thecenter of an axial rod, cross, or tree, with doves or eagles above and serpentsunderneath. Mer-ka-ba means “light-spirit-body.” The merkaba is believed to haveits roots in Ezekiel’s vision in the Old Testament of “an immense cloud withflashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the firelooked like glowing metal.”16 [Phil_9781583943434_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts016](Ezekiel 1:4) That sounds almost like a description of a UFO in the sky.Cabalists online describe the merkaba of the human energy field in a similarmanner—as a star-shaped light body that serves as “your own personal flyingsaucer,” an interdimensional vehicle to access different levels of reality.In Cosmic Christ, Jesus appears to teleport to other energized geometric realmsof the cosmos (signified by complex stars and cubes) by activating thismultidimensional spaceship in his fourth chakra. Gazing at this image, Iwondered if Christ’s ascension might refer not to his physical elevation to somekingdom above, but rather to a dimensional shift into his Father’s domainalready present within him. I also wondered if he might have bumped into anygiggling aliens driving merkaba-like craft on his way.As I gazed at a burning tree on the right side of the painting, it occurred tome that our species might be moving up the World Tree of Life, through thevibratory fires of third-chakra consciousness—signified by masculine ego,achievement, accomplishment, and willpower (we’ve gone from planting seeds tobeing able to see across the universe in ten thousand years)—into an advanced,integrated, heart-centered reality that will connect us to the elaborate fractalgeometries of source energy and, who knows, maybe even to a reunion with otherascended beings from other worlds.The axial vanguard may have created a cosmic groove or healing wave for otherhumans to follow suit. By instructing us to love each other as we loveourselves, they gave us a way to raise our auric frequency and enable ourcollective energies to lock into phase with the higher vibrations of the heart.As we entrain these energetic rhythms, the waves’ amplitudes increase,magnetizing more people to that higher vibratory consciousness. Once theamplitude grows large enough, a critical mass of people could spark a mass shiftin human awareness across our planet.But this mission of shifting consciousness would require a new action plan, onenot already in the playbooks. As a society, we are a house divided. Across ourplanet, human beings compete for money, jobs, land, resources, time, and energy.It’s the norm for the spiritual, green, and activist groups to be splinteredinto multiple factions, fighting over small blocks of territory, losing sight ofthe larger vision. What if we joined forces, sharing our collective wisdom andgifts? I stared at Cosmic Christ and its abundance of manifestations, and sawmyself as one of many spiritual warriors for a new, equitable, and ecologicallysound society, helping people to deprogram from the predominant death paradigm,to heal from the trauma of parasitic institutions as we build a regenerativeculture that values life and liberates us from work-week slavery, freeing us upto pursue our spiritual evolution to carry out a large-scale soul retrieval forthe Western world.I reflected on the enormity of the challenge. It called for a societal shiftbeyond anything my activist mind could have ever imagined: the fulfillment ofJesus’s promise to bring heaven to earth. I felt poorly equipped to contributeanything that might make the slightest positive difference. But then it occurredto me that perhaps this wild ride I had been taken on was necessary to crack meopen, so that I could pay attention to the spiritual energies at work in thismaterial world and act accordingly. Maybe the same essential download was alsobeing delivered to other people—a massive, compassionate battalion of us—at thesame time."},{"pageContent":"[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_017_r1.jpg]THE FIRST EXTRATERRESTRIAL CITY ON EARTH[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_L02_r1.jpg]FIFTY-MILE-PER-HOUR WINDS SWEPT through our camp, slamming plumes of whitealkaline dust against the billowing circus tent we erected on aluminum poles.Thirty of us fought the storm with handkerchiefs or dust masks over our mouthsand black-tinted goggles covering our eyes, as we assembled the HeebeegeebeeHealer theme camp at Burning Man. By dusk, we surveyed what we hadaccomplished—a yoga area, healing space, classroom, shaman shack, two giantgreen dorm tents, MASH-style kitchen, and four-person solar-heated shower areawith gray-water evaporating pools. It had been a year since my virgin Burn, andI was ecstatic to be back in the desert, taking part in building the mostoutrageously creative city on the planet.“I want to be a Heebee,” Jade said the next morning while piling her plate withthe camp’s spinach and mushroom omelet, French toast, and pancake breakfast.Here in the middle of the desert, we were eating better than we did at home.Jade wore what would be her preferred daytime outfit for the week—knee-high,eighties-styled striped socks, hot pink or lime green panties and bra, large skigoggles (for the dust), and a Little House on the Prairie print bonnet that sheloved, but which I thought looked homely. I kept my costume simple—nothing butglossy paisley fabrics bought cheaply in New York’s Fashion District wrappedaround my waist as a sarong. Sometimes I would sit cross-legged, revealing morethan I realized. Rena later joked about our photographs, “Sarong is so right!”Jade and I decided to camp separately this year, me with the Heebees to learnReiki and practice yoga, and Jade at the Whiskey and Whores theme camp, whichfeatured a Wild West saloon and free shots of Jack Daniel’s for anyone—male orfemale—who took a whirl on their stripper pole. “They’ve been guzzling whiskeyfor days,” Jade said. “I doubt they’ll have the camp ready by their openingparty Wednesday night.” It was only Monday, and a line already snaked out of theHeebee’s healing space with people signing up for free bodywork. At Burning Man,the only things for sale are coffee and ice—everything else is free.To my surprise, Jade joined me in the yoga classes, Thai massages, andfreakishly loud monkey chants, but on Wednesday, she left to teach a workshop onblow jobs for couples at the Orgasmatorium. I attended a Reiki I course led byDragon, a bearded, burly man in a pink bunny outfit. He set up a massage tablein the center of a geodesic dome and spoke with a calm authority. Rei, he toldus, meant “God’s wisdom or higher power” and ki was the Japanese word for “lifeforce energy.”“It may seem strange to some of you, but you are all energy beings, and it’syour birthright to channel these healing frequencies. I’ve taught dozens ofpeople, and they’ve all been able to do it. So can you.” I wanted to learn.Dragon showed us where to place our hands on our clients, how to ground theirfeet and charge their chakras, how to move prana with our intention, and how tobalance the energy flow in their arms and legs. Afterward, he came to us one byone and had us close our eyes as he spiraled Reiki energy through our scalps. Ithad a wild effect: I saw sacred geometric symbols cascading down poles oflight—without the benefit of a single hallucinogen. A warm current buzzed alongmy spine, heating up my palms. That energy then funneled directly into myclient’s field when we went back to practicing the treatment. After eachsession, my client and I felt relaxed, revitalized, “on top of the world,” as heput it. We both noted that the healer received almost as much Reikireplenishment as the client did. “That’s the abundance in this work,” Dragonremarked. “Everyone gets healed.”That night, Jade described the extraordinary two-story-tall sunflower she hadseen the night before and insisted on taking me to find it. After the sun sankbehind the dark mountains in the west, the temperature dropped by forty degrees,and it became necessary to change into winter clothing. I put on black vinylpants, a tan suede coat lined with faux-Holstein hide, and my cowboy hat withblinking flames. It was my cowboy pimp look. Jade wore a fuzzy white hat and herugly green sleeping-bag coat.As we left the Heebeegeebee camp and entered the high-voltage flow of the crowdson the Esplanade, Black Rock City’s main street, Jade handed me some specialchocolate treats—to make things “sparkly” she suggested with a smile. BurningMan was a true tripper’s paradise, and we giggled at a school of luminescentgoldfish swimming by on art bikes, “Lego Man” dancing in front of a pixelatedLED screen, and a guy driving a mushroom-shaped scooter with hiscamouflaged-brown body serving as the stem.Black Rock City’s thirty-five thousand inhabitants were arranged along a seriesof semi-circular boulevards, which were numbered like a clock from 2:00 to 10:00with the alien-headed Man positioned at noon or midnight, depending on how youlooked at it. We started at 9:00 and walked the crowded curved Esplanade all theway through the yellow and green flags of Center Camp at 6:00 until reaching3:00 far on the other side—a journey that took hours in our state of heightenedcuriosity for all things shiny, funny, and blinkie. All that time, Jade wasconvinced that the giant metal sunflower was only a few paces away. Finally, shesnickered, “Jonny, you know that sculpture we’re looking for? Well, I think itmight be mobile.” We broke out laughing. The probability of running into aparticular art piece on wheels among several thousand acres of hyperspacedistractions was less than zero.We gave up on the sunflower and headed into the shadows past 2:00, where thecity streets end and the loudest dance parties begin. From a distance, we caughtthe distinctive grinding beats and industrial saw-like riffs of DJ Lorin (a.k.a.Bassnectar), who we had heard was spinning that night. We walked toward themusic, climbing through a maze of parked bikes into a surging crowd that jumpedwith arms raised in time with DJ Lorin and his bouncing waist-long black hair.He had on the same blood-red T-shirt and black eyeliner that he wore at theBrooklyn warehouse party on the night I started seeing auras.Jade threw off her sleeping-bag coat, revealing a frilly pink silk teddy thatwas worth waiting to see. She grabbed me from behind and showed me her best “R.Kelly bump and grind,” as she put it. At first, I gave her the awkward white-guymoves, but then I tried to match the serpentine passes of her hips, followingtheir curvaceous patterns and natural rhythms. Jade had always complained that Idanced with my shoulders and head, flailing as if about to fly out of my body,but here I was enjoying the grounded pleasure of getting dirty on the dancefloor.“Jonny, look!” Jade pointed at a massive sunflower that was being hoisted overthe side of the dance floor by a large green crane, its mechanical stem. “That’swhat we were looking for all night.”“And it just happens to be lurking over Bassnectar’s set,” I laughed.“Another one of those Burning Man synchronicities,” she smiled.I had ingested only a dash of Jade’s chocolate treats and felt a light, pleasantbuzz. Usually, I had to be pretty blasted before my self-proclaimed guides wouldshow up. But now, under the glow of the towering sunflower, they announcedthemselves, giggling in my ear, humming tunes that suggested hexagonal patternsin my mind’s eye in sync with Bassnectar’s low metallic pulses. I welcomed them.They asked me to close my eyes while I traced Jade’s dance moves. “She knows howto follow the energy,” they told me. “You’re learning.”Behind my eyelids, I saw a computer-animated scene of earth back in its boilingvolcanic days three to four billion years ago, when a single-celled creaturemagically appeared on the planet’s harsh surface. In fast-forward, I watchedthis cell multiply and spread, mastering the art of photosynthesis beforedividing into more geometrically complex eukaryotes, then into early sponge-likeanimals, stretching out into the segmented skeletons of fish, crawling andgasping as rubbery amphibians onto land, morphing into lumbering dinosaurs,dissolving into furry mammalian rodents that would grow and shape-shift intoapes and chimps, finally straightening their backs as Homo sapiens, who couldraise up the electric antennae in their spines through their crown chakra toreceive the higher frequencies of the cosmos.While viewing this Cliffs Notes version of evolution, I continued to swervealong with Jade’s sinuous hips, concentrating on connecting the energy flow frommy heart to my second chakra. I realized how much I fought being present andbecame aware of this planet’s difficult and dense three-dimensional vibrations.“Cowboy, you know the great thing about grounding yourself and unifying yourheart with the lower chakras?” my guides whispered in my ear.“What’s that?” I asked.“It’s really fun!” they cheered.With those words, I got beamed from above with a purple tubular light. Theeffect was so powerful, I looked up to see if a flying disk hovered above thedance floor, but I saw nothing except the starry night and a tiny moon sliver.The beam stayed with me as I stepped away from Jade, and my crown and rootchakras filled with white light. The energy poured into my electro-spiritualsystem from above and below, circulating through my heart chakra. Immediately,my back straightened as if tugged by a puppeteer, allowing the pneuma to followits natural course, activating my chest area.With my heart center suddenly glowing brightly, a gray energetic curtain beganto lift from my eyes to reveal a beautiful, luminous latticework of electrifiedprana stretching across the dance floor, out to the deep playa, and intoinfinity. I saw a complicated grid-work of white light connecting us all in thedeliciously high vibrations of love. Not a hippy, naïve love, this was rigorousand mathematical, full of intricate geometrical relationships that swirled theenergy in immaculately constructed designs. At that moment, I remembered apassage from the Gospel of Thomas, “The Father’s kingdom is spread out upon theearth, and people don’t see it.” (11.2:113)The veil had been temporarily removed from my eyes, and I could see theinterconnected white patterns pulsing through Jade, the DJ, the dancers, andmyself, as we participated in this cosmic drama in our physical manifestations.With the illusion stripped away, I could see that we were part of an ocean oflight. We are light flowing, moving, and transmuting shape similarly to the waythat water morphs into steam and ice and snow. I understood Jesus’s line about“loving your enemies.” From this perspective, we were all divine Shakespeares,creating and playing the roles of muscled heroes and conniving villains, pioussaints and debauched sinners, corrupt CEOs and disinterested temp workers.Watching this “immeasurable light,” as the Gnostics called it, I suddenlyrealized that I had one man to thank for my journey into this sudden mysticalawareness: none other than President George W. Bush. I sent him a prayer ofthanks, wishing him well in finding his way to the light.“Jonny, are you going to stand there or dance?” Jade bumped me from behind.“Dance,” I said.I spun her around, placed my knee between her legs, and pulled her into a lowand sweaty grind, kissing and stroking her face, dipping her backwards and thenpulling her up into me. Dancing with Jade in the whirling white latticework, Isaw that it didn’t matter where she and I came from—whether we representeddifferent galactic lineages, as the familiar voices suggested, or simply hailedfrom white-trash Colorado stock and neurotic Northeastern roots. These weremerely conceptual differences, imaginary constructions of divine light, wantingto know itself in new forms.After Bassnectar’s set, Jade put on her sleeping-bag coat, and we plowed througha mild dust storm to grab vanilla lattes at Center Camp. Jade complained thatthe dust would give her throat cancer, and I clenched up at her bizarrehypochondria. I heard my guides giggle that I should lighten up and playmore—being judgmental was a blockage I needed to overcome. The purple beam shutoff, and the white grid was gone, but their presence lingered. My heart felt theeasiest it had been since nearly a year before when Bush took the election. Thatwas an unexpected realization. As we stood in line and I surveyed the costumed,bead-wearing, face-painted horde wandering through the Center Camp café, I wasstruck by just how heavily the political defeat had weighed on me. I alsocontemplated that my giggly guides seemed to be suggesting that to be aneffective political reveler, I needed first to connect to my heart and thenperhaps to help build a movement with other freaky visionaries, like thosearound me. What good is a revolution anyway if it isn’t joyful?At the roaring burn barrel outside Center Camp, we ran into two friends ofJade’s, Don and Sarah. Sarah crouched on her knees wearing an Uncle Sam hat,attaching pads to the end of her fire poi chains in preparation for a firedance. She looked up at us and cheered, “Jonny America, every time I see you, itbrings out my shaman side!” In that second, her smile flickered into a sidewaysslit, her head transformed into a giant gray scalp, her eyes stretcheddiagonally into wide black alien eyes, and her nose shrank to two narrowpinpoints. Sarah had just revealed herself to be one of the gray aliens I hadread so many negative things about while researching the Draco reptilians.Instead of being freaked out, however, I took it all in without a pause—one morepiece of initiatory information on the wild side I was now walking. It didn’thurt that she looked friendly and, frankly, kind of feminine.“Look who’s talking,” I said back to her.Don gave Jade a warm hug, and she nuzzled close to him. I always felt a tinge ofjealousy about their friendship, even though Don and Sarah were married. Don hada lot of the qualities that Jade admired, including frat-boy humor and aslightly macho attitude. He had co-founded an online advertising company worth$850 million, owned his own brownstone in Park Slope, and although slightlybalding, he was tall, muscular, and Jewish, which would make her family happy.Don didn’t appear to be wearing a playa costume. He didn’t need to. He madeenough of a presence in his simple tan coat and blue jeans.I returned my gaze to Sarah and heard the familiar voices giggle, “See, not allaliens are ugly.” I giggled too. Don caught this, and he turned his gaze up tothe stars and then back on me. He leaned in so close I could feel his breath.“You’re up there, aren’t you?” he grinned. “I can tell, but don’t worry—you’llground when the sun comes up.”“How do you know?” I asked.“Sarah and I have our own ET connections. When we first met at Burning Man acouple years ago, we ate some fungi on a golden, vibrating art pyramid, and sheliterally took off her face and showed me the sexy gray alien she isunderneath.” Should I reveal to Don what I had just seen? I decided not to.“That’s incredible. But aren’t the grays bad?” I asked.“Most, but not all. Aliens are like people. Every one is different, and youcan’t judge solely by race. Hell, even some of the Lizzies are helping out thesedays.”Sarah lit up her poi and began spinning the chains. She was new at fire spinningand struggled at it. Uninterested in our conversation, Jade walked over to holda fireproof safety blanket for her.“How do you know about the Lizzies?” I asked Don. I was surprised he knew thePleiadian nickname for the reptilian aliens. I was also amazed that Jade and Ijust happened to bump into her two friends who claimed to have ET connections.Was it chance, or one of those playa synchronicities?“While in bed after that first date with Sarah, my spirit was taken up to amother ship with huge windows overlooking the earth,” Don told me. “I sawthousands of saucers beaming down indigo lights of intention to help the planetascend, but there were a few ships, some reptilian, I was told, that beamed downnegative energies. My ship was full of bizarre and entertaining creatures—acarnivalesque federation of sorts. They told me they had brought me here because‘I could handle it.’ ” Don made quotation marks with his fingers in the air.“You know, it’s funny,” he said. “People have this tinfoil-spacesuit, 1950s ideaof aliens, but the beings I saw were galactic bohemians, David Bowie–like artstars, flamboyantly androgynous healers, and outrageous alchemists. A lot ofthem had really cool tattoos. They come from advanced societies that havesynthesized art and science, so they know how to have a good time. I think ofBurning Man as the first extraterrestrial city on earth. It completelyintegrates technology and visionary art with neo-tribal ritual. I figure mostpeople attending came from other planets originally. They just don’t realizeit—yet. The playa is a portal, preparing us for the cosmic dance partyeveryone’s waiting for.”At that moment, a man wearing a black duster and a fedora stepped up next to usat the burn barrel. He seemed upset. Head drooped, he took off his leathergloves to warm his hands.“Are you okay?” I asked him.He lifted the brim of the fedora, revealing cracked red skin around his eyes. Hewas in his mid-twenties, with a thick Greek-looking unibrow, round chipmunkcheeks, and dark stubble on his chin.“New Orleans is gone, man,” he said with a southern drawl, his eyes on theflames. “My house was wiped out. Katrina took down the whole city. People aredying in the streets, mostly blacks. Bush won’t do a damn thing. Thousands areholed up in the Superdome and abandoned in flooded prisons right now, left torot. It’s totally third world. I can’t believe this is America.”“I’m so sorry,” I said. He tried to hold back tears. I put my arm around him forseveral minutes, then he tipped his hat, said “Thanks,” and walked away.I couldn’t tell what was more surreal—my alien introductions or the fact thatthe birthplace of jazz was under water. It all felt like pieces of the newnormal. I reported the news to Sarah, Don, and Jade. Isolated in the never-neverland of Burning Man—where cell phones don’t work and there is no email—we hadn’theard what was happening off the playa in the “default world.”“This is only the beginning,” Don said. “America is broke—$12 trillion in debt.Saving New Orleans would cost too much, unless we radically switched prioritiesfrom armaments to people. With each coming catastrophe from global warming,corporate entities are going to use the ‘Shock Doctrine’ to take control oftraumatized populations. Get ready,” he said. “The fight for the planet is on.”Walking back to the Heebee camp that morning with Jade, the sun’s rays groundingme for the coming day, we passed by an eight-foot-high café counter servingcoffee to a stilt-walking ringmaster and a stilt-walking giraffe, two muffin artcars (one chocolate, one blueberry) racing each other down the nearly emptyEsplanade, and a dirty-talking remote-controlled robot that hit on Jade. Ourstroll brought back memories of a lunch-hour walk near The September 11th Fund’smidtown headquarters. I remember noting each office, bar, bank, restaurant,shop, and apartment building and seeing for the first time that our entireculture is constructed of places where we work to make money to buy things, andplaces where we recover before going back to work so we earn money to buy morethings. At the time, I couldn’t imagine a society other than this depressing,monochromatic hamster wheel.But Burning Man offers something different. The festival does without thearbitrary laws and regulations that draw lines between people, isolating themfrom one another, boxing them in to consume more and more stuff. The society ofthe Burn follows guidelines that encourage participatory culture and communityengagement. If a windstorm strikes down a party tent or light sculpture,volunteers quickly rush to put it back up. If you need a coat or a hug, peopleoffer it to you, living in the spirit of the gift. Helpful Rangers in khakicargo pants patrol the grounds, acting more like Boy Scouts than likebody-armored cops with guns. There is a general trust for each other thatenables people to feel safe to embody the festival’s mantra of “radical selfexpression,” which explodes in a circus-like spectrum of creativity andplayfulness.In Black Rock City, the clashing viewpoints of rugged individualism andcollectivism meld into a dynamic social sculpture where the flame-throwingbarbarians and leather-clad Thunderdome gladiators pitch in together to set upcamp, or collect ice from Arctica (the ice store), or fill in a kitchen shift.These simple agreements lead to rampant synchronicities, as all of us have ourhearts opened by resonating with the higher frequencies around us.Perhaps Don was right: maybe Burning Man is the first outcropping of a newgalactic culture on earth. But as I saw it, there was still one big problem withBlack Rock City—it lasts only one week a year."},{"pageContent":"[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_018_r1.jpg]THE RISE OF REALITY SANDWICH[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_L02_r1.jpg]I FINISHED ASSEMBLING JADE’S BULKY WHITE IKEA dresser, made of a balsa-wood-likematerial, without a screw drilled into it. IKEA furniture has the integrity of aJenga puzzle: one wrong pull on the sock drawer threatened to crash the wholething in pieces on the hardwood floor of our new third-floor Williamsburgapartment. Jade examined the results of my work and spotted a pinkie-nail-sizedscratch in the back.“The dresser’s completely ruined!” she yelled, stomping her bare feet. “We haveto return it!” It took me a minute to realize she wasn’t joking.Before that moment, I had regarded Jade’s OCD as a somewhat endearing quirk, butnow I recognized it as a mental condition not to be underestimated. As her pinkfeet pounded the floor in indignation, the risks of moving in with ananal-retentive woman with a self-proclaimed Rottweiler temper struck home. Overthe next few weeks, Jade ranted about a dish in the wrong cupboard, granolacrumbs on the couch, and untied bedroom curtains in the morning. After ashouting match over my inappropriate use of a paper towel rather than a clothnapkin, I slammed the bathroom door, turned the shower on, and sat in the tub.In true delicado style, I sulked with the hot water beating down on me. Itoccurred to me that I had moved back home with my mother. How could I be mymerry cowboy self when I had no room to relax?I should have known not to move in with Jade. The guiding voices had recommendedthat I “stick it out” with her; they didn’t say we should share an apartmenttogether. Now I was trapped, with no money to pay a deposit on another place.I avoided home for a couple of days, staying at a friend’s apartment in theindustrial neighborhood of Bushwick. The time apart calmed Jade. She apologized,explaining that the move had stressed her out, and we decided to givecohabitation another shot. After that, living with her became a lot of fun. Iwould come home from sweeping the halls of Eyebeam to find our new SnowshoeSiamese, Blue, dressed in a Hawaiian lei with Jade holding his front paws in ahula dance. She made colorful art out of patchwork quilts and hung it on thewalls, choreographed private burlesques to Warrant’s “Cherry Pie,” and hostedimpromptu puppet shows with the complimentary sex toys she received through heradvice column. I learned from her sense of constant play. While I had alwaysworked too hard on piecing together rent, doing projects, and pursuing my owntransformation, Jade gave herself time to enjoy all sorts of earthly,nonsensical pleasures. Through her, I could see that it was safe for me to dothe same, to while away hours doing silly, nonproductive things.Around this time, I began to search for a modern Gnostic church I could attend.I figured that I wasn’t the only person attracted to the practices of ancientChristian mystics and that a town of eight million liberal-minded folks wasbound to have at least one Gnostic place of worship. The only thing close that Idiscovered was a Meetup.com [http://Meetup.com] posting—thirty-four people hadsigned up expressing interest in attending a regular meeting of the New YorkCity Gnostics. Intrigued, I signed up to host the first gathering.The following Wednesday, ten Gnostic-curious attendees huddled around a smallcircular table at Caffe Dante, an Italian pastry shop in the Village. In stripedsweaters and slacks, modest gray or blue business suits for those coming fromwork, our crew looked like an unassuming monthly book club. The group consistedof a documentary filmmaker, a tax accountant, a dog walker, two NYU Englishmajors, a marketing consultant, a Westchester housewife, a high school teacher,an unemployed actor, and me. During introductions, each mentioned growing upProtestant, Catholic, or Evangelical and eventually leaving the church aftergetting sick of being threatened with the prospect of going to hell. Each memberof the group still held onto the belief that there was something about Jesusthat these dogmatic institutions didn’t understand.The unusual texts piled on the table before us daunted our little Gnostic club.These were not detective thrillers or easily digestible Oprah selections, butcomplex spiritual puzzles with titles like Eugnostos the Blessed, The Thunder:Perfect Mind, The Sophia of Jesus Christ, and The Tripartite Tractate. Theyfeatured bizarre sets of characters such as the four luminaries of the aeons(Harmozel, Oroiael, Daveithe, and Eleleth) and the seven powers of the archons(Athoth, Eloaiou, Astaphaios, Yao, Sabaoth, Adonin, and Sabbede). Perusing thesegospels, the tax accountant threw down his thick, hardcover copy of the NagHammadi Library, which crashed onto the table like a cinder-block. “How are weever going to make sense of this?” he asked.But with time, we did learn more about the complex and varying cosmologies ofthe aeons, archons, and Demiurge, as well as the history and beliefs of Gnosticforefathers such as Simon the Magician, Basilides, Valentinus, and Marcion. Weeven staged some of the ancient dances and recited the poetry of these earlyChristian mystics in an attempt to revive the experience of the original rites.Eventually, we left the cockroach-riddled walls of Caffe Dante and rented aprivate meditation room in Chelsea where we could incorporate our own ritualsinto our meetings. Members guided us through chakra activations,transformational breathwork, vowel chanting, shamanic journeys into theunderworld, and middle pillar meditations—but it all felt flat and wasultimately disappointing. Lacking the powerful pneumatic transmissions of thelost lineages, the New York Gnostics made for a fine spiritual book club, but itwould never double as a mystery school. We just didn’t have the experience.One day I received an email through the Meetup group from a man who claimed tobe a Gnostic bishop. His name was Gerald, and he ran a small Gnostic church inthe village of Tuckahoe just north of the city. He claimed to retain the innerwisdom of the twelfth- and thirteenth-century Cathars, a persecuted sect fromthe Languedoc region of France. He offered to teach me what he knew, and I tookhim up on his offer.Gerald operated his church out of a crumbling Masonic lodge that looked as if ithad been abandoned for the last hundred years. His entire congregation consistedof two haggard, elderly men—one African American, one Caucasian—with stubblywhite beards. They both doted on Gerald, a short, sickly, potbellied man in hissixties, with small boils on his face, dressed in black pants and a blacklong-sleeved turtleneck. Gerald chain-smoked Marlboro Reds, explaining throughrepeated coughs that he didn’t quit cigarettes because, “Kid, I can heal mythroat through intention.” He called me “kid” almost every time he spoke to me,which I found both movie-like and annoying.In the auditorium of the lodge, the three Gnostics interviewed me for an hourregarding spiritual questions before entering a side room to vote. As they hadonly three members, most pushing the average life expectancy, I knew theywouldn’t say no. The men came back wearing white cleric’s albs and black masksover their eyes. Apparently, they needed the masks to hide from evil spiritswhile they indoctrinated me into the first level of their order.They turned off the lights, lit candles, and began to chant and grumble inmonstrous-sounding, gravelly voices. I sat through hours of prayers while theytapped a broad sword on my shoulders and had me repeat unfamiliar Latin phrases.Eventually I was asked to stand up, walk in circles with my eyes closed, placemy hand on the Bible, and swear an oath in Latin, and then master a couple ofcomplex magical handshakes. The ceremonies were boring and interminable, but Ikept coming back, thinking I might eventually glean some initiatory wisdom aftergoing through all the ceremonial hoops and whistles. But that was not the case—Ihad achieved higher states through mid-level vinyasa yoga classes. After severalweeks of pomp crap, I met with Gerald alone in the lodge’s basement to expressmy reservations about the lack of gnosis in his Gnostic church.“Look, kid,” he puffed out cigarette smoke as he talked. “I’ll let you in on asecret: the Gnostics were all killed off. If you’re looking to be one today,then become a Sufi. They’re the only Middle Eastern mystics with their lineageintact.”I was still looking for a spiritual path. After my disappointing encounters withGerald, I recalled the energy transmission I received at the Reiki course duringBurning Man, so I signed up for a Reiki II class. I learned the symbols forpower and protection (Cho Ku Rei), mental and emotional balance (Sei Hei Ki),and long distance healing (Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen). In the Reiki III Master course,I learned how to give attunements to myself. Every Wednesday, I would studyunder the tutelage of several bubbly elderly women—the “Reiki ladies” as Icalled them—who wore big, old-people glasses and grandmother-styled pink andbaby blue woolen sweaters during healing exchanges at a Union Square spa. Theytaught me how to scan a client’s aura for problems, unclog blocks in themeridian system, scoop out negative energy, spin the chakras in the correctdirections, and cycle prana through my heart center, since that was the placewhere they said healing occurs.One of the Reiki ladies recommended that I invite Jade to a beginner’s tantraclass for sacred-spot massage, thinking it might help unite our different pathsof sex and spirituality. Halfway through the daylong course, the overly jovialmale instructor, in matching red Hawaiian shirt and shorts, pulled the men asideto break the news to us. “The sacred spot is located in a place you might finduncomfortable at first,” he said. Following the instructions we received inclass, Jade rushed me to the shower when we returned home. I spent a long timeunder the spray, preparing for the uncomfortable place the instructor had warnedus of. After I toweled off, Jade called me into the bedroom, where she stoodnaked, her voluptuous tan skin illuminated by candles placed around the room.She caressed and kissed me, and led me to our bed where she rubbed massage oilon my chest, trying to relax me for what came next.She applied silicone lubricant to her index finger and, kissing my inner thigh,gently inserted the finger into my anus. “God,” I thought, “Please, don’t letJade write a column about this.” Jade slowly wiggled her finger, while strokingmy penis. It felt surprisingly good. I followed the teacher’s instructions tobreathe deeply up my spine, pulling energy up from my pelvis to my throat, andto release the vibrations with loud exhales and vowel chants. Jade’s handsheated up, stirring up blocked energy inside that sensitive area. As I sucked upmore pneuma, my whole body began to convulse with tiny electric sensations,causing larger ripples to roll through me with each extended “ohhhhhhh” and“ahhhhhhhh.” It felt amazing, but the experience was tainted by the possibilitythat Jade would write about it. Please, not this one. All her friends knew who“the cowboy” was, and I didn’t want them to visualize this escapade.“Ahhhhhhhhhh. Uhhhhhhhhh.” I let out more pleasure-filled vowel chants, puffingthe energy up my spine. I held on for longer than I expected, maybe twentyminutes, until an energetic wave came through that was so large, it ripped ascream out of me as I convulsed on the bed from my first full-body orgasm, whichlasted a heavenly two or three minutes. A murky blue fog of energy slowly liftedfrom where Jade’s finger had been. I sobbed out pent-up sorrow that hadaccumulated in the area, before finally breaking into laughter after it hadfully released. I pulled Jade over my body and dotted her face with quickkisses. Who knew healing could be so pleasurable?Before that night, our sex life was conventionally adequate. Two tantalizingboxes of sex toys lay shoved under the bed, rarely opened. Men often remarkedafter meeting Jade, “You must be the luckiest man alive, dating a ‘sexpert.’ ”But our partnership felt more like a comfortable companionship, with Jade payingmore of the bills while I offered up the intellectual component of ourconversations—“I always learn from you,” she would say. But that night, Isnuggled up against her with Blue purring between our legs, thinking that thisjust might be the “starter family” I wanted and the sexual life I had beenwaiting for.“Jonny,” Jade whispered as I was about to fall asleep. “I think I might be asexual healer.”“I think you’re right,” I said. Even those pesky guiding voices claimed that shecame from a sex-chakra-based galactic line.“You know, Jonny, I’d like to write an article about tonight. I think it wouldhelp people. You don’t mind, do you?”A few days later, I received a call from an old acquaintance, Daniel Pinchbeck,the author of Breaking Open the Head: A Psychedelic Journey into the Heart ofContemporary Shamanism. In Burning Man circles, Daniel’s book had become aninstant classic, with its account of his unfolding awareness into mysticalrealms through a harrowing West African initiation ceremony with thehallucinatory rootbark iboga, ayahuasca journeys with a Secoya tribe in Ecuador,and adventures with a mushroom shaman in Oaxaca, Mexico. The book was widelyadmired and debated. I found a lot of common ground with Daniel’s story. Hestarted out as a jaded, dispirited journalist, which felt similar to my owndisillusion with activism, and, like me, he had found visionary prospects and astrange new life through the use of plant medicine and other entheogenicsubstances.Written in an assured, staccato tone, the book made Daniel appear to be thechicest psychedelic hipster alive. When I first met him at a storytelling eventat the swank, 150-year-old Players Club at Gramercy Park, however, I wasinitially disappointed. With his thick horn-rimmed glasses, unevenEnglish-looking teeth, and disheveled mess of dishwater-blond hair, I realizedhe had been born into the neurotic, hyper-intellectual world of New York City.But minutes later, I recognized an unexpected confidence and coolness about himthat radiated an aura of intrigue for those attending the event. Daniel was oneof those rare eccentrics that make for Manhattan legends, like the howling Beatsin the Village in the fifties, the late-night ramblers at Warhol’s Factoryparties, and the punk rockers who played CBGB. There was something magneticabout Daniel that left you wanting to check out what he was doing.On the phone, Daniel told me he was working with a team on a project I might beinterested in. The next afternoon, I went to his cramped Alphabet Cityapartment. Esoteric books covered several bookcases and were stacked inhaphazard piles in the corners. Daniel sat at a desk. His hair looked morescraggly and his eyes more tired than I remembered. He had just returned from across-country tour to promote his new book, 2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl,which I had yet to read.On the couch sat Ken Jordan. With his short-cropped hair and button-down blueshirt, he struck me at first as one of the straightest guys I had met in years.This stiff look didn’t sync with the few details Daniel had told me about him.One of Daniel’s oldest friends, he helped create the popular, activist,street-theater group Billionaires for Bush, which Greene Dragon occasionallymock-battled during demonstrations at the Republican National Convention. He wasalso a digital-democracy pioneer who co-wrote an influential white paper titledThe Augmented Social Network: Building Identity and Trust into theNext-Generation Internet. This guy could have passed for a Dow Jones lawyer. Iwould later discover that he had an impressive, almost encyclopedic memory ofthe secret history and personal stories of the Beats, Yippies, and eighties’ artscene in New York, much of which he had learned first hand from the protagoniststhemselves.Ken introduced me to Michael Robinson, the goateed, quick-witted graphics guruof this mysterious project. Michael had led the global rebranding effort ofRamada Hotels, but then underwent a transformation after channelingalien-looking tarot symbols while staring at a bonfire at Burning Man. He nowfused Madison Avenue chic with alchemical imagery. He was good looking butlanky, charming and yet awkward, with an absurdist sense of humor in line withRingo Starr’s stumblingly brilliant performance in A Hard Day’s Night (whichsteals the entire movie if you’re paying attention). It occurred to me that allthese guys could be labeled “cool geeks,” and I suppose that description appliedto me as well.“So, what’s the project?” I asked.Daniel showed me a mock-up for a web magazine on his MacBook. They called itReality Sandwich, a name that struck me as clunky and bizarre, even though itcame from the title of a book of Allen Ginsberg’s poetry. But name aside, I wasinto the project. Composed of hot maroon and red hues and futuristic fonts, anda logo that featured a Mayan-looking eagle eating a serpent, the homepage had asleek urban shamanista look. At the top of the page, the menu offered disparatecategories—Tech, Psyche, Art, Commons, Eco, and Life. Sample articles coveredtopics as diverse as local non-interest-based currencies, ayahuasca as a healingagent for HIV, zero-carbon cities, icaros in pop music, the relationship betweenpsychedelics and yoga, lucid dream technology, and vertical farming. I sawimmediately that Reality Sandwich represented transformation at its core,focusing on how we can redesign our culture, social structures, and personallives in a celebratory and integrated future-tribal synthesis. Daniel, Ken, andMichael had all been inspired by Burning Man and, like me, they wanted to takeits ideals out into the “default world.”Unlike my previous political organizing, this project didn’t focus on fightinginjustice, but rather on fostering, supporting, and transmitting the memes andmythologies of an emerging movement through open-source digital technology. Fromthe start, the intent was to do much more than publish a magazine. The plan wasfor the site to act as a lighthouse, as Ken put it, attracting a community ofpeople from around the globe in sync with the vision, and connecting them toeach other on- and offline using social networking tools. This projectrepresented the next level of activism, integrating soul and spirit withpractical and tangible solutions.As intrigued as I was by the magazine, what grabbed me most was the communityorganizing aspect of the project. Imagine a network of plugged-in, turned-onBurning Man activists organizing change, neighborhood by neighborhood, sea toshining sea. I was hooked. To get the magazine up and running, they were lookingfor a managing editor to track the flow of articles into the site and help withauthor correspondence. While the job sounded too much like a glorified clerk,the prospect of participating in building the grassroots movement once they gotto Phase Two sounded perfect. Would I join the team? We would be “three Jews anda Gnostic,” Daniel joked.How could I refuse? The project seemed the ideal way to dive deeper into theparadigm shift I had been exploring. But the team had two serious challenges.First, they had no money. Everyone was volunteering—the techies, the writers,the whole crew. Beyond that, the name of the website, in my opinion, wasn’t sexyor marketable. I sat up that night in my meditation nook, brooding over theendless number of volunteer hours I would rack up working for a sandwich, aReality Sandwich. What would Jade think?When we soft-launched on May 8, 2007, three hundred visitors checked us out.Some sent excited emails that our magazine was what they had been waiting for, asite that combined hip subcultures, the radical green movement, and the shamanicand spiritual underground. But either readers got this modern alchemy or theydidn’t—there wasn’t much middle ground. “Don’t you have any identity?” read oneof the many confused emails we received. “You seem all over the map.” But buzzgradually built around the site, and within a year we were getting over fiftythousand visitors a month—an international transformational community largeenough to fill Yankee Stadium.Although we had no budget to pay contributors, Daniel and Ken managed to keepenough feature articles coming in for us to publish daily. Finally, writers hada place to share stories about their own initiatory process of spontaneouskundalini awakenings, psychedelic healings, energy openings, encounters withastral beings, and even galactic contact. Emails poured in from readers: “Hellofrom Boise. I don’t know how to tell my mother I can see auras. What should Ido?” “I’m having a kundalini crisis and can’t ground. Any advice?” “I woke uplast night to find three tall, long-headed people in my bedroom. They say I’m aSirian starseed. What does that mean?”Emails pleading for support or understanding came in so frequently that I feltwe had become an ontological help desk. We rarely answered these notes, otherthan with a gentle word of encouragement. Personally, I didn’t feel qualified todo more—and neither did the others. That was particularly true when we’d getbombastic proclamations from readers who were going through a crisis and wereunable to integrate the spiritual knowledge they were receiving, and they’ddeclare themselves as the only person on earth who grasped the divine nature ofreality—you could tell they were actually having a nervous breakdown. The pathto awakening can be treacherous and without the right kind of support, noteveryone will make it. Many of these readers didn’t need a web magazine; theyneeded a yoga master, a shaman, and an open-minded shrink.Reality Sandwich headquarters gave me a front row seat for watching a multitudeof lights switching on across the electric branches of the World Tree. But aftera year of working two jobs (one of which didn’t pay), I began to feel run downand exhausted, and my relationship with Jade suffered. Luckily, at that point,Daniel and Ken were able to attract our first investors, and they generouslyoffered to make me the first paid staffer. I felt mildly guilty, since Ken had awife and Daniel a daughter to support, but I accepted a small salary thatallowed me to quit working at Eyebeam and start a two-year part-time course atthe Connecticut Healing Institute. A graduate of the class once told me, “Reikiis like knowing CPR. This is like getting your MD in energy medicine.”Barry Gordon, the institute’s director who taught the course, pushed twelve ofus through a crucible of high-frequency energy work that challenged us tobreathe through the “death layer,” releasing fear, anxiety, and limitingbeliefs. In a rented elementary school classroom, we confronted the difficultiesof balancing the brain’s hemispheres, funneling in rainbow colors to repair thespinal column, accessing the red-hot density of hara-line treatments, andharnessing specific vibrations to heal addiction. Clouds of energy oftenencircled my hands as my guides moved my palms over places in a client’s bodythat needed work, zapping healing white light into my client’s field. My guidesseemed talented at this work, and I enjoyed surrendering to their help when theymade it available.I had been able to meet almost every challenge Barry presented until the day heplaced a plastic orange baseball bat in my hands and said, “Jonathan, sink intoyour anger! Feel it! Be it! Own it!” Unlike many new-age Reiki healers, Barrypossessed the gruff masculine humor and disposition of a much loved high schoolcoach. Skinny, tall, and with a rigid frame, in his prime he would have been abasketball forward. “Breathe deep into your abdomen, then yell when you swingthe bat!” he ordered. His directive was a welcome contradiction to theprogramming I had received from my mother, who taught me as a child to bury myrage under shame.I hesitated, then inhaled deeply, and with as much force as I could muster swungthe bat down onto a pillow, which was propped on a chair. Molecules of rage flewout from my nervous abdomen, where the black bowling ball lurked, and shotthrough my arms, releasing upon impact. Primal roars shook out of my bellythrough my throat, and I found myself growling at my mother, “How could you dothis to your own children? How could you not love us?” I crashed the bat intothe pillow again and again, bellowing these words with each blow. All of theenergetic rage my mother inspired in my body came bursting out of my aura,exploding into the pillow. Suddenly the waves of anger crested, and the sorrowthat had been smothered underneath floated to the surface. I cried, releasingthe grief of growing up with a mother who didn’t know how to love her children.As I cried, I was overcome by a sense of peace, and I realized that my momactually did love me. She had done the best she could. Her own wounding hadlimited her capacity to express compassion, just as my own fears and painsrestricted my ability to love.When I got back to New York, I tried something I rarely did—I gave my mother acall. After semi-retirement, my father and she had moved back to a small town innorthwestern Missouri. When I called, they were on the front porch watching aV-shaped skein of geese descend into the swampy wildlife refuge across the dirtroad from their house. My mother was cheerful and buzzing to hear how my “BigApple adventures” were going. You might say she was a little too bubbly, with anartificially high voice that feigned more excitement than she felt. Still, itwas nice to know that she was interested in my life. I told her briefly aboutthe healing program I was in, wondering what she would think. “I’m so proud ofyou,” she said. “I’m proud of all the things you’re doing. You’re such a freespirit. You always have been. I know you’re following your heart.”I could barely talk from the lump swelling in my throat. I knew she had meantevery word.After the call, it occurred to me that it was my own fault that I was estrangedfrom my family over the years. More than a decade had passed since my motherlast raised her voice at me. My sister insisted that mom had changed afteralmost dying of pneumonia—that she was now “full of love.” But I didn’t believeit. Because of my lingering resentment, I stayed in my college dorm, refusing tovisit her at Saint Luke’s in Denver while she recovered. At the time, I didn’trealize how serious the illness was. But to my mother’s credit, she neverbrought it up and never held it against me. She truly must have changed."},{"pageContent":"[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_019_r1.jpg]IN WALKS CHAOS[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_L02_r1.jpg]REALITY SANDWICH’S FIRST INVESTORS, Dave and Macy, dubbed us “The Reality Four.”One winter afternoon in 2008, Daniel, Michael, and I huddled over Ken’s laptopat Cafe Mogador in the East Village, picking at a hummus platter while lookingat a set of three unusual diagrams on the screen. Ken had a way of talkingexcitedly about the geekiest stuff, and I admit, my mind often wandered as herhapsodized about data interoperability or the nuances of user-centric digitalidentity systems. But now he had my attention, because he was explaining how theInternet could support the growth of our marginal scene of radical mystics intoa global social revolution. The diagrams showed how the Internet’s basicarchitecture is perfect for grassroots organizing on a mass scale.The first diagram demonstrated how media worked before the Internet: one big dotat the center, and a lot of lines reaching out from it to smaller dots at theedges. This old model of media is centralized: information and communicationflows from a central source—a TV station, a newspaper editorial room—out to youand me. The second diagram showed how things function in a decentralizednetwork: there were more big dots with lines extending to smaller dots in thecorners, more sources of information that could flow out to info-consumers, butultimately communication still has to be channeled through hierarchical hubswhere powerful people control the flow and decide what can or cannot beexpressed. The genius of the Internet, Ken explained excitedly, is that itsdesign follows the pattern depicted in the third diagram—it’s a distributednetwork.He pointed to a sea of dots connecting to one another by innumerable short,direct lines in a kind of mesh pattern. There were no big centralized dots thatcould act as gatekeepers. The image suggested an attractive web that resembledthe white lattice energy patterns I saw during my epic heart opening at BurningMan. Because everyone on the Internet can connect straight to everyone else,with no meddling intermediaries, people are able to share their talents,resources, wisdom, and passion in a rich and supportive web that cycles energythrough its elegant system, creating a flow of abundance.The image captured our vision for the social network we were building on ashoestring budget for Reality Sandwich that winter. We wanted the communitydrawn together by the web magazine to connect with one another so they couldstart grassroots projects where they lived. The financial crisis of 2008 was inhigh gear, and the bulls of America’s corporate elite—Lehman Brothers, AIG, BearStearns, Countrywide Financial, Ameriquest, Merrill Lynch, Washington Mutual,and Wachovia—were being struck down, one by one, after bundling wealth incomplicated pyramid schemes and hyperbolic derivatives that embodied the Edenicrift of societal scarcity, individualism, and domination.In Reality Sandwich meetings, Daniel often quoted visionary architect R.Buckminster Fuller’s argument that most of the world’s challenges came fromproblems of design. We have the knowledge and resources to take care of allpeople, while protecting the environment. But society’s organization ishaphazard, unconscious. If we want a shot at programming a new societaloperating system, the best chance we have is to circulate the knowledge thatalready exists and give people the opportunity to act on it by linking them toeach other through innovative projects. Our social network would be a platformfor that kind of collaboration. With a name like Reality Sandwich, though, howmany activism-inclined evolutionaries would we ultimately attract? We needed aslicker brand, something less fringy; so I was glad when Daniel got the rightsto use the name Evolver after haggling with a company he had helped to found andlater left. They owned the evolver.net [http://evolver.net] web address but werenot using it. I believe that he got the URL in exchange for his shares in theold company, which became worthless when the venture folded a few years later.As we planned the launch of the Evolver network, our vision of grassrootsregional groups was already beginning to happen in, of all places, Atlanta.Three Reality Sandwich volunteers began to host film screenings, talks,community discussions, and potlucks, and were now planning a green-consciousnessfestival that would unite groups that addressed the multifarious topics wecovered on Reality Sandwich—local renewable energy, plant medicines, rainharvesting, integrated nutrition, and what may be in store for 2012. As ourproject’s de facto community director, I thought we might be able to replicateAtlanta’s model in other cities and build a larger transformational network ofpeople who could learn and evolve together. Ordering more Moroccan green tea,Ken described to Michael and Daniel the new Regionals section I wanted toinclude on Evolver.net [http://Evolver.net] as a way to highlight these offlinecommunities.At that moment I got a call from Jade. “Jonny, I really need to talk to you. Canyou come home?” She was crying so hard I could barely make out her words. “Renatold me about her tragedy.”At the apartment, I found Jade lying on our red, semicircular couch surroundedby crumpled tissues, smashing Blue’s whiskered face against hers. I sat on thecouch’s arm and stroked wet strands of hair out of her eyes.“Jonny, it’s worse than I could have imagined. You know how Rena lived in a SanFrancisco commune that had several houses in it. Well, one of the richerfamilies, the one she was closest to, rented out small cabins on the property tohippies and college students. One evening, one of the hippies went berserk,probably from too much LSD, and the voice of God told him to kill theearth-raping materialists in the mansion above.” Jade threw her face into atissue and rubbed her eyes. Blue took the opportunity to leap out of her armsand escape to the bedroom.“He killed them all,” Jade sat up and looked at me. Silver glitter was smearedacross her face. “The parents and their six- and eight-year-old boys—shot themeach in the back and threw their bodies in the swimming pool.”“God,” I sighed. What an insane tragedy, a massacre of Rena’s close friends.“He was into the same stuff you are,” Jade choked on her words. “Reincarnation,astrology, tarot. He thought he was John the Baptist.”“That can happen with this stuff.” I handed her a new clean tissue, hoping sheknew I could never do something awful like that. “People can go crazy when theyopen up to those realms.”“Jonny, you can’t do that. Okay?”“I promise to be careful. This guy must have had other mental problems. I’m surehe had a history.” I moved close to hold her. Jade leaned forward into my ear.“Rena and her mom fought constantly after the murders. One day, her mom bargedinto her room after an argument, and the bedside lamp suddenly flew through theair on its own and crashed against the wall. Her mom grew afraid of Rena’s powerafter that and sent her off to live with a series of relatives until she finallyran away to LA with her boyfriend.”“Rena really moved the lamp with her energy?” I asked. Jade nodded against myshoulder. “No wonder she’s so afraid of tapping into her gifts.”Integrating Rena’s story proved difficult for Jade and me over the next fewdays. Although we didn’t talk about it again, the story lurked over our granolabreakfasts, through our slow walks to the Williamsburg waterfront, and into thebedroom, where we didn’t have sex but held each other for hours, trying to makesense of the raw brutality of the events. It didn’t feel real that such ahorrific tale could have happened to a friend of ours. Before this, stories ofmass murders were the material of news headlines and the kind of disturbing,psycho-thriller movies that I always avoided watching. Over the next week, Jadeand I were poignantly aware that this world we lived in was not safe. I foundmyself continually repeating, “It’s not safe here.”The next Thursday we had a dinner at Rena’s apartment. We arrived with a bottleof Riesling and tiramisu for desert and found Rena cleaning up a trail ofsqueezable cheese, individual mustard packets, and hollowed out Jell-O puddingcups that her opposable-thumbed, polydactyl cat had dragged out of therefrigerator, having learned to open it on his own. Rena laughed at his handynew skills and then brought out her twenty-year-old calico, which she called“Zombie cat” because she had arthritis and walked stiffly, like the undead. Ihad never seen Rena so lighthearted. Instead of her usual ponytail, she hadseparated her red hair into two playful, schoolgirl pigtails. While servingdinner, she told us some dirty jokes she had heard at work that day.Over Frito-Lay bean casserole, Rena and Jade talked about their favoritecharacters on The Office, a new spin-class teacher they liked, and costume ideasfor an upcoming Burning Man warehouse party. They never mentioned the tragedy,and I guessed they never would again. But a darkness had vanished from Rena’sIrish eyes, as if bringing this shadow material into the light by telling herfriend had lifted part of its power over her. Dipping into the tiramisu, Idropped my fork on the floor when Rena asked, “Jonny, maybe later you could showme some of those healing moves you’ve learned at school.” Before then, she hadnever shown any interest in experiencing energy healing. I didn’t miss mychance. After we washed the dishes, I had Jade lie on the living room rug toshow Rena some of the basic hand positions for balancing the primary chakras.A few months later, Daniel, Ken, and I took a road trip to Baltimore for areading from our first Reality Sandwich anthology, Toward 2012: Perspectives onthe Next Age, a collection of articles from the web magazine. In a sign of howthings were taking off for us (and especially for Daniel), the bookstore hadoversold the space, so the event had to be moved into a Lutheran church nextdoor. It was an old, quiet place, all earthy browns with a musky shine on theantique furnishings. The church looked almost colonial with its dual lecternsand latticed balcony in the back. Behind the pulpits stood an enormous, grimyoil paining of Jesus’s ascension. As incongruous as the location felt—we werehere to talk about ayahuasca and Mayan prophecy, after all—I thought thepainting was a good omen, since my personal journey into the heart focused somuch on ascension.One hundred fifty people filled the pews. Daniel kicked off the evening with alively “Hallelujah!” which was greeted by laughter and applause. Afterward Kenspoke, describing “a subtle revolution occurring, one that if you’re not tunedin, you won’t even know it’s happening. If you’re here tonight, you’re likelypart of it.” Heads nodded around the room. With relaxed confidence, Danieldiscussed 2012 and how the archetype of the Mayan plumed serpent godQuetzalcoatl represented an approaching alchemical integration of spirit andmatter and of the scientific worldview meshing with the shamanic. This mysticalfusion, he proposed, might bring about planetary ascension by awakening ourhearts. I had never heard Daniel talk so openly about the heart before. Healways struck me as too caught up in the mental, like many people I met on theEast Coast. I found it encouraging that his investigations into the Mayans and2012 had led him to similar conclusions as my own explorations into Gnosticismand energy work.At first, when I took the podium, I stumbled on my words. I was a novice publicspeaker compared to Ken and Daniel, but once I started, I eased into thepleasurable rhythms of sharing my journey from dejected political organizer toparadigm shifter who sees energy fields. For the first time, I shared with anaudience what I had been researching—the mystery schools and the lostsignificance of words like sin, savior, and repent, as well as the energeticsecrets of the Tree of Life, the ida and pingala channels, the kundaliniserpent, the spirit from above, and the possibility that we are experiencing adimensional shift through the merkaba in the heart chakra. I touched on thepotential of ayhauasca to open up spiritual channels, which even the churchminister seemed interested in, but I didn’t mention my galactic encounters sinceeven my closest friends met these stories with ridicule. (Seeing auras andkundalini shooting up my spine were somehow more acceptable than the prospect ofmeeting aliens. Go figure.) It had been a long time since I last spoke before alarge group. I sat down after my fifteen minutes, glad to be back on stage, andrelieved I could speak publically without wearing an outrageous stars-and-stripecostume. Goodbye, Jonny America.During the question-and-answer period, a thirtyish woman wearing a goldIndian-looking shawl and long feathered earrings asked why I thought energy workwas so important to the ascension process. I answered that human evolution hasalways involved taking power from the gods—whether it was Prometheus stealingfire, Adam and Eve discovering the secrets of agriculture, modern man harnessingelectricity, or physicists splitting the atom. And now, I wondered whether wemight be discovering the massive potential of our own psychic energy totransform our society and ourselves. Daniel riffed off this idea, discussing howrevolutions have been speeding up over time. It took millennia for theagricultural revolution to happen, hundreds of years for the industrialrevolution, and decades for the information revolution. Perhaps, he suggested,we might be at the cusp of a psychic revolution. In only a few years, we all maybe experiencing expanded consciousness—and gnosis, I hoped.Afterward a dozen people approached me, saying things like, “Thank you. It’sbeen a long time since I’ve felt like a Christian.” “I always knew Jesus was anenergy healer. I just didn’t have the name for it.” “I guess we’re sufferingfrom two thousand years of bad translations. What if more people knew aboutthis?” Even the pastor of the church, with his blood-vesseled nose and goldchain cross dangling over a green corrugated sweater, waited around to say,“That’s some interesting stuff you talked about. I’d like to know more.” Iwondered if it might prove to be more effective to reach people by talking aboutJesus than by dressing up as a patriot.A demure woman with long blond hair introduced herself. Her name was Alia, andshe had just returned from Tavis and Mitchell’s new eco retreat in Prescott,Arizona. I hadn’t seen Tavis since our last ayahuasca ceremony, but I’d heardshe was having fun building sustainable paper-crete domed rooms for theirfledgling retreat center. “Tavis says hi,” she said. Alia worked at the Abode ofthe Message, a Sufi center in New Lebanon, New York, but she happened to bevisiting Baltimore that day. She talked about the Suluk Academy, which she andTavis both attended, and how training with their teacher Pir Zia helped herevolve much faster than she would have on her own. “It’s a real mystery school,like the ones you talked about tonight, and they use energetic transmissions toshift consciousness. It’s very powerful work.” I thought back to Bishop Gerald’sparting words—that if I want to be a Gnostic, I need to become a Sufi. So far, Ihad been on a reckless journey as a mystical desperado roaming the wild astralfrontier on my own. I was increasingly aware of the dangers that being a lonerider invited. It was time for me to join a spiritual community and learn fromdisciplined mentors. After all, the ancient Gnostics didn’t just wander out intothe desert by themselves to undergo the initiatory process; they went to school.That night, Ken and I shared a room at the Sheraton in Baltimore while Danielgot a room by the airport so he could catch an early morning flight to aspeaking gig on the West Coast. While nodding off, I felt the familiar presenceof my guides float in. Once again, they appeared without the assistance of apsychedelic substance. As I welcomed them, they began to pour soft energy overme. The vibrations thickened, and they channeled in more powerful frequenciesthat filled my aura with a luminescent indigo light. My whole body oscillatedwith the gorgeous, liberating pneumatic current flowing into me. “We have amessage from Jesus,” the voices told me. Although groggy, I somehow understoodthat they were not referring to my parent’s idea of Jesus, but rather to a vastand complex cosmic plane, an overarching energy structure that stretched acrossrealms of the divine pleroma.Their message from Jesus didn’t come in fiery words or thunderclaps. It appearedas an advanced, alien-like holographic image that slowly downloaded into mycrown chakra. The hologram was the size of a volleyball, star-shaped with dozensof skinny three-dimensional cones sticking out in all directions from its smallglobe core. It twirled clockwise while gently settling into my chest.The familiar voices informed me that the shape held “healing vectors” that Icould use when talking about Jesus in public.“Really, how does it work?” I asked. I didn’t see what this spiky geometricglobe could do. It looked like a clunky mirage sent straight from some sort ofSecond Life virtual world.“Cowboy, like everything else in healing, you’ve got to set your ego aside sothe energy can do the work. You still have a lot to learn about surrendering. Itmakes things easier.”“It would help if I could see who I’m talking to.”“That’s what you think,” they giggled until their laughter softened intosilence.Alone in the room, I watched the globe slowly spin inside my chest until itseemed to melt into the indigo light that had been beamed into me. Strangely, atthat moment, an image of my mother came to mind, and I sensed the difficult“soul contract” she had accepted so as to teach me lessons in overcoming my ownvictimization karma. I was beginning to see that there was a greater lesson tobe culled from her violent rants at home, that I could learn to surpass my fearsand anger, transmuting those experiences into love and compassion. With thatinsight, the black bowling ball in my stomach lurched upward. It rotatedclockwise and then pulsated rapidly, until a pool of dark energies broke throughmy pelvis and rushed down my legs and out the soles of my feet, clearing outmuch of my system. I felt purified—as when a fever finally breaks after burningoff the toxins from your body.“Thank you, Jesus,” I found myself saying, humbly holding my hands in prayer,wondering if he (it?) may be a more tangible reality than I had expected. I hadspent a couple of years investigating Jesus as a mythic figure, but now itseemed possible that this energy might be something I could connect withdirectly.Over the next few weeks, I felt clearer, but I realized that myblack-bowling-ball issues were far from gone. Healing is like peeling an onion:you remove layer after layer until finally, after much effort, you get to thecore. I wasn’t yet at the core. Thankfully, Jade was out of town, which gave methe space I needed to integrate my spiky-globe encounter.She and Rena had ventured to San Francisco to escape New York’s bleak winterweather. She called to report that they had seen the gingerbread facades of thePainted Lady Victorian houses, climbed steep Telegraph Hill, combed the sexboutiques in the Castro, and shopped at vintage stores in the Mission. But Renanever showed Jade her former commune outside of town where the tragedy had takenplace. After San Francisco, Jade stopped in Milwaukee for a few days to visitfriends from Burning Man. To cover airfare, she set up a blow-job class,instructing participants on the finer points of oral pleasure. For mysex-columnist girlfriend, this was a typical business trip, but she didn’t callor return my messages for a few days, which was unusual.When Jade got back, the first thing she said after dropping her bags and takingoff her coat was, “Jonny, we need to talk.” My heart sank into my gut. Alreadyin tears, she went into the kitchen and poured us both shots of whiskey overice. She still hadn’t hugged me or said hello. Jade hadn’t even searched forBlue to give him her usual overzealous squeeze. Ice clinked in her glass as shebrought the whiskey to her shaking lips. It was strange to see a woman sovisibly worried while wearing an I ♥ VIBRATORS long-sleeved shirt.“Jonny, I love you so much,” she reached for my knee. “I just want you to knowthat.”“Just tell me what happened.” I could already feel my anger, but I now knew howto channel that force up my spine instead of going on the attack.“I never thought this would happen, but while in Milwaukee, one of the Burnersfrom our theme camp began chatting me up. You know I’m a natural flirt, but thiswas different. We had some bizarre connection. While hanging in a Burner partychill space, he put his hands on my heart, and this crazy energy just floatedbetween us. It felt strange and amazing, like I had known him before, in anotherlifetime even. We did it for hours. We didn’t even kiss or anything … not then.”Jade spoke a little louder, “Jonny, now I know what you’re talking about. Thisspiritual stuff is real. It really is, and I don’t know what to do with it.”“Who is he?” I asked.“His playa name is Chaos,” she said. How appropriate, considering the mess hehad injected into my life. “He produces network TV shows in New York, but hehappened to be visiting Milwaukee.” This was worse than I thought. Not only didI have a rival, but he made real money and lived in the city.“Did you sleep with him?” I asked.“It’s not really about that. I’m having some type of mystical opening, and Idon’t know what to do.”“Did you sleep with him?” I repeated sternly.Jade stared into her whiskey as if it held some untold secret. She downed thewhole glass and nodded.I crossed my arms and turned away from her. “What does that mean for us?” Justbecause she had a fling didn’t necessarily mean we would break up. But I washurt, confused, and trying to find the way forward.“I suddenly realize how important my spiritual life is. I don’t know what to dowith this, but I feel the universe is calling me on my journey, just like youwere called a few years ago. It’s time for me to explore my own paradigm shift.”“But Jade,” I pleaded, “We could do this together. I’ve been waiting for you toexperience this. Now we could meditate together, go on retreats, practicetantra. It’d be great to do all that with you.”“Even if we did try, you know that our energy has always been off. As a healer,you can’t deny that.”Jade threw some clothes in a bag and stayed with Chaos for the next week.Sometimes she stopped by in the evenings to visit or to organize her things. Westill loved each other, and I hoped for at least one final night in bed withher—a little breakup sex to help soften the blow of losing Jade—but that requestbrought her to tears. “That would be cheating on Chaos,” she said. The ironythat she was concerned about cheating on this new guy cut deep.I threw myself into work to avoid thinking about Jade, but a range of emotionsinevitably arose during lunch breaks and rides on the subway. I found myselffiercely jealous, picturing a big-muscled, three-piece-suited Chaos touching herbody. Then at times I honored Jade’s encounter with her energy awakening andeven admired her decision to move forward where that process invited her to go,as ugly as it was turning out to be for me. I had long hoped she would stumbleon an energy opening that would rock her foundation. Now it appeared that theChinese curse “May you get what you wish for” was coming to haunt me. At theworst moments, drinking Brooklyn Lager alone at home, I doubted her entirestory, wondering if this newfound spirituality was a convenient excuse to fuckanother man.Within a week, she moved in with her younger sister, a doctor living in theresidential apartments of St. Vincent’s Hospital in the West Village. Chaos, asenergetically appropriate for her as he may have been, wasn’t ready to live withJade, although they were now officially dating. In a two-sentence email, she letme know she had registered for an Urban Tantra certification course so she couldintegrate energy into the sex-education classes she taught.The apartment was hauntingly quiet. Many of Jade’s things—her white IKEAdresser, quilt wall art, sex-bloggers calendar, and Disney spiceshakers—cluttered the space like museum artifacts from a past era. Slowly, itsank in that there would be no more Fiesta Blue celebrations, no more “CherryPie” burlesques, no more sex-toy puppet shows, and no more Bon Jovi sing-alongs.Much of the laughter had left the building. Although Jade and I often buttedheads, I had grown to love her spunky nature and the playful adventures sheinitiated. I also enjoyed the comfortable life we had gradually built together.It’s the closest I’ve ever been to having a safe and happy home.In the evenings with Jade now gone, I sulked in our bed, petting Blue whilewatching the dim lights of the Williamsburg Bridge twinkle over the brownstonerooftops.“I guess our starter family is down to two,” I told him.After several weeks, I finally found the nerve to sit still in the meditationnook and question my guides about why they had insisted I stick it out with Jadeand why they had called her my queen.“You guys lied to me,” I said when I finally felt their presence arrive towardthe end of a long meditation.“You did good work, cowboy,” they responded. “Your karma with her is over, andyou can now move on with the rest of your life.”“Thanks a lot,” I grumbled. “But this might be the last time I follow youradvice.”"},{"pageContent":"[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_020_r1.jpg]THE GALACTIC COWBOY[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_L02_r1.jpg]THAT SPRING EVOLVER.NET WAS BASICALLY operational as an online social network.Built on a tiny budget, the site was clumsy; some features didn’t work properly,and annoying bugs went unrepaired. “We’re trying to jumpstart the evolution witha ’56 Studebaker,” Daniel joked while we waited for the slow homepage to loadduring a team meeting. Regardless of the site’s shortcomings, people respondedto Evolver’s mission—which was captured by our motto, Find the Others—andconnected with each other through the blogs, events, news stories, and projectdescriptions that they posted. It was gratifying to read glowing comments fromnew members about how they finally had a social network where they could sharetheir visionary explorations with a like-minded community. Of course, we alsoreceived disheartening posts titled “Evolver is lame” or “This site sucks,”complaining about how limited the platform was. “Why can’t you be more likeFacebook?” one blogger asked, comparing our cash-starved start-up to themultibillion dollar corporation.But unlike Facebook, our aim was to bring people together in physical space, notjust through their computer screens, in order to foster real community. We hopedlocal Evolver groups would initiate positive change where members lived, as ourReality Sandwich outpost in Atlanta was doing. But how could we inspire more ofthese collaborations? For help in brainstorming that question, I met with AndrewBoyd, the architect of the political street-theater group Billionaires for Bush.Whereas Greene Dragon had operated only in New York City, in 2004 Andrew hadorganized several dozen regional Billionaire chapters across the U.S., which wasan impressive feat.Andrew was short, with brown wavy hair and squinty eyes. A college buddy ofKen’s, he was in his mid-forties, but looked twenty-five with his boyish thinface, silver hoop earring, and thin nose that seemed to angle at you from anydirection. Andrew had a skeptical activist attitude that couldn’t condoneanything “woo-woo.” I knew the type—I had been that way myself—and I didn’t lookforward to a lunch defending the ayahuasca “cult” I was now involved with. ButAndrew was brilliant at conceiving campaigns. Known as one of the Left’s topcultural activists, MoveOn often hired him to juice up their initiatives.In a corner booth of the busy Essex Street Market, a prewar holdover on theLower East Side that hosted a chaotic array of produce vendors, pickle stalls,and specialty delis, we ate messy egg sandwiches while I barked at Andrew overthe din about our intentions for Evolver. “If you want to build a network likethat, you need a monthly ritual,” he insisted with characteristic certainty.Given his secular inclinations, I was surprised he used the word “ritual.” “Youneed an event that brings everyone across the network together at the same time,something that gets them excited.” Andrew pointed out other viral grassrootsorganizations that used this model: Green Drinks, Drinking Liberally, andCritical Mass, which all host events on the same day in many cities. Ienvisioned regional Evolver groups hosting monthly creative salons and culturalincubators organized around a different theme each month—topics like food,water, alternative health, shamanism, local resilience—that connected the dotsbetween the head and the heart. I could see us syncing energies and intentionsacross the planet, even coordinating collective healing meditations or prayersduring crises like Hurricane Katrina. Evolver would be an activist healingnetwork.The rest of the Reality Four loved the idea of holding a monthly ritual, so weput out a call for community organizers. Within two weeks, we had enoughvolunteers to create sixteen local Evolver groups. We still needed a name forthese monthly events—something fun, unconventional, maybe even a little sexy,that would separate ours from the myriad lifeless lefty gatherings out there. OnReality Sandwich, we were always careful to run articles about how people canparticipate in positive change; we didn’t publish the typical progressivecomplaints about the miserable condition of the world. Our approach was “Don’tmoan. Do something constructive—and don’t forget to dance.”The monthly events had to project the same attitude, but we couldn’t seem tocome up with a good name. Because we needed to send out an announcement for thefirst meeting in a couple of weeks, I gave the team a deadline. We were about tohave our first Reality Sandwich retreat at a ranch in the glorious red-rockdesert of south central Utah. By the time the retreat was over, I said, we hadto decide on a name.Playing off the success of Daniel’s book 2012 and the subsequent RealitySandwich anthology Toward 2012, the theme for the retreat was also titled“Toward 2012,” with the clarifying subtitle “Envision the Next Age.” Togetherfifty of us would explore the threads of the emerging, post–New Age culturewhile enjoying one of the most spectacular landscapes imaginable, the pristinenatural habitat of the Utah desert.The ranch where we were meeting sat on forty-eight acres with breathtaking viewsof the dusty red cliffs, canyons, and crags of the Grand Staircase–EscalanteNational Monument that was once sacred Anasazi land. The property included alodge with an expansive great room and surrounding deck, several nearby logcabins, and a waterfall in the front yard ravine. It was nice to be visiting aspot where my cowboy hat matched the natural setting.The ranch belonged to Reality Sandwich’s first investors, Dave and Macy. Theyhad seen Daniel on a panel at Burning Man. Inspired by his talk aboutevolutionary change, Dave mailed copies of Daniel’s 2012 to twenty of hisclosest business associates. While some of his corporate buddies thought thatthe book was a visionary look at a possible post–peak oil world, othersquestioned Dave’s taste, if not his sanity, for his interest in crop circles andMayan prophecy. Dave and Macy are staunch believers that revolutionary shiftsneed to happen in our society, and that’s what attracted them to our project.They had been pushing us to have this retreat since they bought the ranch a fewmonths before, and they did most of the organizing.Michael, our wise-ass creative director, called them “relentlers,” as thishappily married couple was always on as hosts, coordinators, socializers,and—last but not least—partyers. They were both crazily generous, but had asloppy streak, which gave an anything-might-happen-at-any-time excitement andconcern to the proceedings.In her mid-thirties, Macy was solid and athletic. She wore faded jeans andbutton-down cowboy shirts. A non-Mormon country girl from Utah, she guided us onhikes down winding canyons and up steep mountain inclines that pushed everyone’slimits but her own. If she hadn’t been such a playful, caring, and doting oldersister to all of us, she would have risked mutiny from some of the retreatparticipants.Barely over five-and-a-half feet tall, Dave was one of the most swaggering,sociable cowboys I had ever encountered. His stubbly black beard andenthusiastic, gravelly voice reminded me of the bragging soliloquies ofeighties’ wrestler Macho Man Randy Savage. He wore a stylish black leathercowboy hat, which he reluctantly admitted buying at the Indiana Jones ride atDisneyland. Dave drank warm Tecate out of the can by the campfire, beguiling uswith proposals to fake alien abductions at future retreats using fog machines,strobe lights, and a naked person running out of the woods. He was alwaysgenerating ideas for amusing pranks, but you couldn’t imagine him going throughwith them because somebody’s feelings might get hurt. For all his bravado, Davewas an honorable, sympathizing softie.The desert days were filled with riding horses through crooked high-altitudeforests, examining half-human, half-deer-like creatures in shamanic pictogramsand petroglyphs, luxuriating under the 126-foot waterfall at the oasis on LowerCalf Creek, and driving over the roller-coaster-like Hogback Ridge with itssheer canyons that dropped hundreds of feet just inches from the shoulder ofHighway 12.Each evening, the fifty of us gathered inside a large green geodesic dome,decorated with Christmas lights and an eight-foot hanging metal fish sculpture,to share ideas that would probably be ridiculed in more mainstream circles.Dennis McKenna, a Santa Claus–bearded ethnopharmacologist and brother ofrenowned psychedelics proponent Terence McKenna, talked with Daniel about howMother Earth may have given humankind plant medicines, such as ayahuasca andpeyote, as a last-ditch attempt to awaken consciousness and reconnect us withher natural ways before we deep six her biosphere. In his Kermit the Frog voice,Dennis suggested, “Maybe that’s why these sacred plants are becoming so popularthese days.”The writer Charles Eisenstein was a Reality Sandwich favorite. He had short darkhair, a rigid regality and grace that reminded me of Leonard Nimoy, and a deepmonotone voice that commanded attention when he spoke. Whenever someone askedhim a question, he would pause and stare at the person for several seconds,which had the effect of either cracking emotional gateways that needed to beopened or unnerving participants into asking another question before he hadanswered the first one. I wasn’t sure if the overall effect was healing ordisturbing. “Storytellers are like shamans,” Charles said, “spinning magic andcasting spells across entire cultures. All of us here, I have no doubt, havecome to co-create a new story and help to manifest it.”Jim Enote, a soft-spoken, middle-aged Zuni tribesman who wore schoolmarm glassesand had long black hair parted in the middle, cleansed us in a water ritualbefore shyly mentioning the “star people” (meaning aliens) his tribe claimed tocontact directly through ceremony. Members of his tribe responsible for thesecommunications dedicated themselves to a serious regimen of daily rituals. Theywoke up well before sunrise each day to engage in ceremonies with the starpeople, but unfortunately Jim wasn’t permitted to tell us what they did or withwhom they were in contact. That was classified tribal information.After Jim’s talk, a group of fifteen people stayed in the tent to share theirown galactic experiences. From their stories, it seemed that the Zuni were notthe only ones in contact with otherworldly beings. A medical insurance salesmentold of his “DNA-altering energy-healing” downloads from some celestial realm. Asixty-year-old lawyer from Indiana claimed that small, big-eyed green peoplevisited her bedroom when she was a child. A sexy, twenty-something,Gypsy-looking girl said that every time she meditated, she talked with “funny,long-headed Sirians” who couldn’t shut up about the secrets of the Egyptianpyramids. An elderly UN project manager claimed she was “activated” by a councilof Pleiadians on her sixtieth birthday, after which she began to channel helpfulmessages from them. Could all these folks be out of their minds? I suppose thatwas possible, but they all struck me as reasonable and stable otherwise. I hadyet to talk publicly about my own alien encounters and was still confused abouthow to articulate them, so I sat quietly, in awe that I was not the only oneexperiencing—or at the very least imagining—other-worldly contact.“God, where else can you talk about stuff like this without getting laughed at?”the Sirian-curious gypsy girl said as we stood to leave. “It’s like we all knoweach other from somewhere before, and now we’re coming back together—almost likewe’re trying to remind ourselves of something we already know.”Sharing in discussions like that each evening in the warm green dome led me tosee Evolver and Reality Sandwich from a different perspective. I already feltthat the Reality Four had become a kind of family; we often joked and sparredlike brothers. Our transformational outfit, I realized, was united by somethingdeeper than friendship and a common cause—something that would hold us togetherthrough the many obstacles that might come. Those who had trekked to theretreat, some from as far as England, Germany, and South Africa, also talkedabout an inexplicable calling to this union of like-minded souls.Perhaps the goal for the upcoming monthly Evolver rituals wasn’t just to helpfacilitate grassroots collaborations, but also to gather members of our growingtribe who were remembering their ancestral ties to spirit—who were drawn tonurture and care for each other like lost loved ones while healing our ailingplanet. Maybe I was projecting my own unmet desires for supportive kin;nonetheless, those nights at the retreat forever altered my dreams andintentions for my personal journey. When you drive up to the gates of BurningMan, a crew of face-painted revelers greets you with cheers of “Welcome home!” Iwanted Evolver to welcome people home, but not just for one week a year. As withfamily, I wanted these connections to last.On the final night of the retreat, Dave, Macy, Michael, and I meditated in anabandoned underground grain silo that sat a football field’s length away fromthe main lodge. The previous owners had let the structure fall into disarray. Iinhaled dust with each deep breath. Feeling claustrophobic, I left the group togo outside. From the dirt road, I could hear the neighbor’s horses grazing inthe alfalfa field cradled in the valley below. The moon was nearly full. Itslight bathed Boulder Mountain’s summit in a mist of iridescent silver. To thenorth, the Big Dipper sparkled like fireworks frozen in place against the night.Far from city light pollution, I could see thousands of stars dusted across thearching Milky Way, even with the moon rising brightly from the east.Stubbornly, I tried to construct the various constellations I had forgottensince taking an astronomy course at the University of Colorado’s planetarium. Itwas an 8:00 a.m. Friday freshmen class, which meant I usually arrived hung overand slept through the lectures. Had I suspected I would one day want to know thewhereabouts of Sirius in Canis Major, our closest spiral galaxy Andromeda, orthe blue seven sisters of the Pleiades star cluster—because I seriouslyentertained the notion that I might have a kinship to gigglingextraterrestrials—the cynical freshmen I was would have spit up his thermosedBloody Mary in disgust.While eyeing the stars, I suddenly heard the familiar voices of my guides. “Uphere, cowboy,” they called out from the southwest corner of the property. Twolarge magenta lights appeared over the far ridge just beyond the alfalfa fields.The lights were bright and disk-shaped; they zipped up and then across inperfect right angles. Airplanes can’t do that.“Why don’t you come over here and give me a lift?” I shouted, unsure if I spokeout loud or in my mind. I hoped nobody in the silo heard me.“That would be too easy,” they giggled back.“You guys are so predictable,” I joked quietly. Even if they had demonstratedtheir concern for me with energy healings and insightful downloads, I figuredhumor was the only way to deal with their constant evasiveness. I felt blessedby their presence, but part of me—most of me—was baffled by their cheekyattitude. I had no way of knowing who they really were or what they wanted. Icould never accept their claims of alienhood until I shook their skinny four- oreight-fingered hands and stared in their giant bug-like or perhaps albino-cleareyes.I cut the conversation short when I caught Michael’s tall, lanky gait coming outof the silo. He walked over and put his hand on my shoulder, taking in thestriking moon-frosted landscape. “It ain’t no Gowanus Canal,” he joked,referring to the gash of polluted water in industrial Brooklyn, “but she’ll do.”He followed my gaze to the southwest ridge where the magenta lights continued toshoot right and left, up and down, in impossible Tetris-like ninety-degreeangles. These lights were showing off what they could do.“Wooo,” Michael sighed. “They’re beautiful. Aren’t they?”We stood there for ten minutes admiring the magenta lightshow in silence. Themoment felt pregnant with mythic possibility. What strange wonders thisstar-speckled galaxy offered! What strange worlds and beings lay out therebeyond our grasp of space and time! If only we could burst through the speed oflight, as we had with the sound barrier, what worlds would we discover aroundthe nearest jellyfish-translucent nebula?The clomp of boots on the silo’s wood entry broke my concentration. I turned tosee Dave and Macy stepping onto the dirt road. When I glanced back at the ridge,the magenta lights were gone.We all walked back to the main fire together, Michael at my side. “That wasincredible,” he said.“It’s the first time I’ve seen UFOs,” I told him.“What?” Michael jerked his neck and grabbed my shoulders. “You saw UFOs? I wastalking about the stars!”“Michael, are you kidding? You were looking right at two of them for tenminutes. You didn’t see anything?” I was miffed. I thought we had shared aonce-in-a-lifetime other-planetary moment. Now I wondered if I was imaginingthings.Dave overheard our conversation and pulled me aside. “Jonathan, have I ever toldyou about my galactic cowboy?” He took off his Indiana Jones cowboy hat andleaned in so nobody would hear. I told him he hadn’t, and thought how strange itwas that Jade had called me that exact name—her “galactic cowboy”—when I startedobsessing over Cosmic Christ mythologies. Just hearing the phrase made me missher. Even with our domestic disagreements and misfiring chemistry, I still lovedher and looked fondly on the years we had spent together. I felt so alone nowthat our starter family had disbanded.In his gruff Macho Man voice, Dave excitedly told me about the galactic cowboyhe encountered each time he smoked the “spirit molecule,” as he called it.According to Dave, he would blast out of his body, past all the stars in theuniverse, breaking through a curtain of carnival-like colors and landing in aweird cactus desert. He would spot an ominous cowboy riding in the distance.Under the cowboy’s tan Stetson was the half-covered face of a big-eyed, grayalien. In the distance, an enormous, prismatic, multi-armed goddess withkaleidoscope peacock feathers sat on an emerald pyramid.Dave said that, at times, the sickness of humanity—war, greed, andaddiction—would follow him into this realm. The skies would then turn dark andsinister, and the goddess would morph into a hideous Wizard of Oz–type witchwith flames shooting out of her mouth. Dave would quickly shift his thoughts ina positive direction, and the witch would turn back into a goddess, and sunshinewould return to the hallucinatory world. Through all this, the galactic cowboywould sit silently on his horse. Like a cosmic Clint Eastwood, he wouldstoically nod his approval if Dave’s thoughts tended toward helpful insights,and shake his head in disappointment if Dave harbored shadow thoughts thatdarkened the visionary landscape.“What do you think it means?” I asked.“That’s too big a mystery for me, but the galactic cowboy’s been training me tofocus my thoughts on the positive.” Dave lowered his stance so that he waslooking up at me and placed his hands on his hips. “Jonathan, it occurred to meat this retreat that you might be the galactic cowboy from my journeys.”“It’s strange that you say that. My girlfriend used to call me ‘her galacticcowboy.’ But while you were telling your story, it hit me, Dave, that you mightbe your own galactic cowboy.”At the group campfire, Dave reached into his ice-less cooler and pulled out twoTecates for us. “To the galactic cowboys,” he toasted and then pulled me into asidearm hug, shaking me hard. “You know you’re my brother, Jonathan.” I let thatsink in, trying to receive the love. For all his pranks and exaggeratedsocializing, something about Dave made you feel protected at all times, likehaving a favorite older brother who always had your back. Without a doubt, hewas family to the Evolver tribe.The next day we held the closing circle for the retreat. A lot of people criedas we said goodbye, although we would see each other again online and at futureretreats. Several folks were headed back to start their own regional Evolvergroups to bring the vibe of this place and our world-changing spirit to theircommunities. After almost everyone had left, I pulled the rest of the RealityFour aside on the lodge balcony. “We promised ourselves not to leave without aname for the Evolver salons,” I reminded them. “We need to pull the trigger onthem. They start in two weeks.”Daniel picked up his suitcase, ready for his ride to the airport. “Let’s callthem Spores,” he said nonchalantly.“That’s it,” Ken agreed. “That perfectly describes the interconnected mycelialnetwork. Spores can land anywhere, allowing for new life to emerge. Plus, thename is fun. It sounds trippy.”The other guys left, but I stayed at the ranch an extra day to hike with Daveand Macy in the barren, Mars-colored slot canyons of the Escalante. As we droveback to the ranch on a sandy four-wheel-drive road, I watched a lone, dark dustdevil curl through the sagebrush. It wove slowly toward us and hovered in frontof Dave’s black Land Rover. He stopped the car, as it seemed to be waiting forus, spinning ominously. After a couple of minutes, it snaked across the road andcollapsed to the ground.Whistling at what we had just seen, Dave turned to me and asked, “Jonathan,would you like to partake of the spirit molecule tonight?”That evening, Macy created a bed of pillows, blankets, and cushions for me inthe geodesic dome. Dave held the pipe to my lips, telling me to inhale more thanI thought possible. I inhaled until the room disintegrated into a disturbingmosaic of angry, vibrating white fractals, my nostrils filling with a hideousburned-metallic smell. “More,” Dave suggested. I didn’t think my lungs couldtake it, but I inhaled, sucking in more of the toxic taste. The pulsing fractalsexploded all around me, stranding me in a complete and heavy darkness. Terrorgripped at my stomach. I didn’t want to go further. “More,” Dave said with firmkindness. Somehow, I forced another drag before falling back on the cushions. Iwas aware of being me, but I couldn’t sense my body anywhere. I was onlyconsciousness.The darkness remained and I waited, thrilled and afraid of what might come. Asmall white dot appeared in the void. It opened wide, forming the shape of acircle, a hole, a portal—something through which a bright colored figure leapedat me. I pulled back, whatever “I” was at the time, given that I still had nobody. With some space between us, I took in this magnificent being: it was anenormous female fairy with friendly, sensuous, almond-shaped eyes andmother-of-pearl butterfly wings. She looked computer animated, with greenMatrix-like coding scrolling patterns on her skin. She swept around me, dipping,swirling, playing in the air. As if someone had turned on stage lights, apixilated field of dancing sunflowers with human faces rolled out in alldirections, while liquid-crystal waterfalls began to gush from digitallyconstructed mountain peaks in the distance. The beauty of this cyber landscapewas almost too much to take in.“This is real. It’s real,” the pixie told me, sweeping through the air. “You’rewaking up to it. Remember, remember, remember. We’re waiting not so far away.”From my abdomen, I heard a voice screaming, “NO, NO, NO!” as if it couldn’tbelieve the existence of such marvels. I instantly recognized the voice as theblack bowling ball that had weighed me down my whole life. A dark hole appearedin the center of the daisy field, sucking in the color around it, tugging metoward it. “NO, NO, NO!” the hole screamed, draining out the colorful splendorsaround me. I fought to focus my attention away from its destruction andconcentrated on the prancing pixie, the crystal-like waters, and the bliss-facedsunflowers. As I centered my attention on this optimistic scenery, the holereceded, leaving behind lush, synthetic-looking green grass.The pixie blinked her eyes with loving approval as a giant blue sun rose aboveus, illuminating this world in twilight colors. I wanted to dip into thecomputer-generated waters, to fly with the pixie to the pixelated mountains, butan unseen force began pulling me away, back to some even stranger place thanthis one.“Remember, remember, remember,” the pixie waved goodbye with her wings.I exhaled and found myself lying under gold Christmas lights in a large greendome. It took a minute to recognize Dave and Macy holding my arms on each side.I felt light and open. The journey had been surprisingly healing for aten-minute trek into Tron-land. A sudden gush of dark energy rushed out from myabdomen. I involuntarily arched my back, breathing through the painful release.“Jonathan, how are you feeling?” Macy caressed my face.I tried not to cry—these were our investors, after all—but I couldn’t stopmyself. I let the tears come and cleanse some of the anger and sadness I hadgripped onto so tightly all my life.“Growing up, my family was so intense,” I found myself saying.“We’re your family too,” Dave squeezed my shoulder.“We love you, Jonathan,” Macy said, which made me cry even more.The next morning, Dave and Macy drove me back to Salt Lake City so I could catchmy flight. We were exhausted from the previous day’s hike and spirit moleculeceremony. Dave stopped at a gas station on Highway 28 for caffeine, but theywere out of coffee and soda. Only in Nowheresville, Utah, I thought. Dave wasdriving onto I-15, heading north, when I fell asleep in the back seat. Aboutthirty minutes into my nap, my guides started screaming in my ear, “Cowboy, wakeup! Wake up!” It felt as if they were shaking me. Startled, I opened my eyes andlooked at the road ahead. Dave had nodded off, and the Land Rover and the silverbox trailer it was pulling were veering off the highway at seventy-five milesper hour toward a deep gully in the median.“Dave! Dave!” I jumped forward and shook his torso. “Wake up!”Dave’s arms leaped into action, jerking the steering wheel away from theapproaching drop. The SUV’s passenger-side headlight smashed into a green milemarker, snapping it in half, as we swerved back onto the highway. At first, Daveover-corrected, then swung the wheel back left, landing us safely in the passinglane. But the silver box trailer jackknifed against us, tossing the Land Roveron its side. In action-movie slow motion, Macy and I floated up toward the rightside of the vehicle, slammed against its metal doors, and crashed back into ourseats. The SUV slid on its side across the pavement, shards of window glassshooting up like bullets below us. It skidded the length of a football fieldbefore slowing to a stop next to the right shoulder of the road. Smoke billowedfrom the engine, smelling of burned metal. Dave asked if we were all right andthen shouted for us to hurry out.“God, it smells like last night’s journey,” Macy said, climbing out thepassenger door.Slowly, I lifted myself to my knees and crawled outside, rubbing my lower backwhen I got on my feet. Shocked by the violence of the crash, Macy screamed,“Dave, how could you be so reckless! You nearly killed us!” He returned thecharged energy, shouting, “Get off my back!” They yelled like that for severalminutes until Macy fell into Dave’s arms, shaking and crying. He stroked herhair, saying, “Thank God. We’re all okay.” My hands were tremblinguncontrollably, and I walked twenty feet into the dry grass meadow along thehighway. I turned to the dusty mountains in the east, breathed in deeply, andhollered the rage and trauma out of my lungs and throat, madly swinging my armsand fists. The anger work I had learned in healing school paid off. Within aminute my hands grew still, and I walked back to the road, feeling calm butexhilarated.Dave gripped my neck in gratitude, “Brother, we would all be dead if you hadn’twoken me up.”It was true, but I wasn’t the one to thank. Whether the voices were spiritualguides, galactic tricksters, or my own self-generated delusions, I couldn’t denytheir assistance on this one. Never had I suspected that pursuing a mysticalpath could have such practical implications. This strange access to anotherlevel of information hadn’t just given me helpful advice or healed an oldemotional wound—it had saved three people’s lives. I was struck by the enormityof it. Could it be that following our initiatory path and connecting with highersource wisdom might actually be one of our species’ best defense systems? Isthat what we need to do to survive, and perhaps even to thrive, and avertplanetary devastation?The police drove Macy and Dave to the next town, while I rode in the tow truck’spassenger seat. I stared at the dense cube of black metal that had once been aLand Rover, steaming behind us on the truck’s bed. Carcinogenic,spirit-molecule-like odors slipped through the window from the smoldering heap.In that mangled clump of metal, I envisioned the twisted dark energies of my ownlife, the black bowling ball that had plagued me since childhood.Remarkably, this brush with death felt like a rebirth. It confirmed that I hadto leave the dark pit behind for good, and focus on the beauty and joy aroundme. I had to release the remaining anger and sorrow attached to my family,friends, and even those who may have trespassed against me in past lives—if suchthings exist, and I was inclined to think they do. It was time for me to forgiveand to ask for forgiveness, time to reach up to higher planes that I couldbarely imagine. It was time to let go of what I was holding onto. It was time tosay goodbye to my relationship with Jade, finish my energy-healing program, andcommit to Sufi training. I had tapped into cosmic mysteries, or more accuratelythey had tapped into me. I owed it to my guides, and to myself, to accept adisciplined path so I could better understand this magical realm of which I wasnow consciously a citizen."},{"pageContent":"[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_021_r1.jpg][images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_L02_r1.jpg]JANUARY 17, 2011AFTER SHARING MY TALES OF PARADIGM SHIFTS, kundalini debacles, galacticencounters, and related adventures, I introduced what we now called the EvolverSocial Movement to the audience of sixty-five people sitting on the beigeseventies carpet of the suburban Austin home. In eighteen months, we had grownto forty Spores. I shared with them my most ambitious vision—Evolver spreadingan emerging heart-based culture, contributing pockets of light that, with otherlike-minded communities across the U.S. and abroad, organically harmonize withone another, creating a synchronized latticework to counter today’s dangerousand divisive systems. As the old societal models collapse into darkness, I seethese lights growing and shining brighter, providing beacons of hope for thosewho dream of being part of the creation of a new world story. Members of thisnetwork of light would share their gifts, passions, and energies to manifest anincredible yet tangible miracle—a global awakening and long-awaited return toour heavenly garden on Spaceship Earth.Then I opened the floor to those wanting to start a Spore in Austin. Theneotribal-meets-hipster crowd rattled off a list of yoga studios, loft spaces,and warehouses where they could hold local activations. They also proposed anumber of renewable energy, Insight Meditation, time banking, sacred geometry,food share, and Reiki healing groups they could collaborate with, and theyraised key local issues to address.The most immediate concern was the “billion-dollar mistake on the lake,” aproposal to erect a gratuitous water treatment plant that threatened alreadyendangered wildlife at nearby Balcones Canyonlands Preserve. The plant wouldprofit rapacious contractors while sidelining the more practical and affordablewater conservation approaches that the local community supported. Someonesuggested a spiritually aligned response, and the group embraced it. Thatweekend they would participate in a water-healing ceremony that would double asa protest against the facility. This was the kind of sacred activism that turnedme on, as it brought the high vibratory power of spirit into the denser planesof the material world.The conversation also tapped into the general frustration these people feltliving in a liberal oasis in Republican Texas. “What do we do about neocons likeGovernor Rick Perry?” asked a thirtyish woman with maroon streaks in her hairand a spiral-shaped crop circle necklace dangling over a Radiohead T-shirt.“These guys are telling gays they’re going to hell while selling out our stateto the coal industry.”“You need to stand together against injustice,” I offered. “But also stay firmin your compassion. If you fight inside their antagonistic paradigm, that’sexactly the energy you’ll get back—more anger and divisiveness. I see much ofour work as holding a certain vibratory container, one that comes from theheart, magnetizing others to our cause as they begin to wake up. Let’s createnetworks for those opening to this energetic shift and then, as the old systemsfail, we’ll welcome the latecomers into the fold. Unlike in the sixties, todaythere are no squares. Everyone is welcome to this party, but we also can’t forcethem to come.”A bearded man with feral brown eyes, around twenty-five years old, wearing awhite American Apparel hoodie, leaped to his feet and addressed the audiencewhile his hands flailed excitedly. “I have this vision of us bear-hugging theold regime hold-outs,” he blurted. “We’ll squeeze harder and harder as theybattle us off, until finally they relax and surrender to love!” He passionatelyclenched his invisible antagonist until he released him into the ecstasy ofuniversal friendship. A din of whoops, claps, stomps, and whistles filled theroom as we embraced the palpable hope that together we could build a world ofunstoppable love.But the next afternoon, as Kyle—a bald, plump elder from the sixties psychedelicage—drove me to the airport in his faded blue Volkswagen bus, my optimism abouta global, heart-centered renaissance deflated as we plodded through thecongestion on Highway 71. Although the city prides itself on itscounterculturalism—the slogan of the Austin Independent Business Alliance isKeep Austin Weird—that spirit failed to translate when it came to urbanplanning. Trucks and SUVs crammed the wide, mica-flecked parking lotssurrounding the endless tan and gray strip malls and big-box discount monolithsthat had gobbled up the wheat fields, prairies, and open range in alldirections.A brown film hovered menacingly over the polluted skyline while a phalanx ofbillboards stalked the freeway, assaulting drivers with tawdry marketing ploys.McDonald’s fetishized a glistening microwaved burger with the postmodern haikuBeefy Cheesy Glory, an enormous glazed doughnut announced that America Runs onDunkin’, and an intimidating black cross asked Will You Survive the Rapture?This contrived landscape offered a bleak reminder that we in the consciousnessmovement were hugely outnumbered, ridiculously outspent, and flat-outoverwhelmed by spirit-crushing religious doctrines and a consumer culture thatkept people under its powerfully destructive trance.On the radio, an NPR reporter told how psychiatrists had neglected a disturbedtwenty-two-year-old man who later gunned down eighteen people including Arizonarepresentative Gabrielle Giffords in a Tucson supermarket parking lot. Hearingthe story, my eyes dropped to my lap as I thought of the many Americans whosuffer from profound soul-wounding—walking around deadened and traumatized, orviolently angry and disoriented, disconnected from the wild sacredness of life.I’ve read that in tribal societies, elders often diagnose spirit illness earlyand tap their best shamans and healers to provide treatment. Sometimes theentire community gathers around the patient, dancing and singing medicinalsongs, knowing that each person’s health empowers the tribe as a whole.That enlightened healing response is hard to imagine in America, wherearchon-like corporations pounce on those who need help the most. Big-pharmacompanies like Pfizer and Merck peddle exorbitantly priced pills to thosesuffering from depression, anxiety, physical illness, and sexual dysfunction.Loan consolidators and bankruptcy firms prey off those ruined by unemployment,foreclosure, and debt, while Manhattan derivative sharks profit from hellishlyoverpopulated privatized prisons and spikes in food prices that starve theAfrican continent. Defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Blackwater (nowknown as Xe) feed off our never-ending wars, as ExxonMobil and BP strip theremaining parcels of Canadian, Alaskan, and Amazonian wilderness to fuel ourdeath tango with oil. We are an achingly long way from being a healer nation.My Sufi teacher Pir Zia Inayat-Khan says that when rivers become polluted, theygo back to their source—the ocean—to be renewed. Humans also need to go back tosource to be renewed. Our source is divine energy. It seems that our whole worldneeds that type of healing. Looking at the signs around us, it’s hard to tell ifuniversal Christ consciousness will return to the earth on a mass scale, or ifpeople will just keep yapping away in an endless parade of self-help workshops.Will the populace finally activate as they did in the times of Gandhi and King,or will we let the military-industrial buzz saw cut us to pieces? Will coastalregions galvanize to clean and heal our sickened oceans through bioremediationand collective intentional prayer, or will we continue to treat our waterways asthe toilets of petrochemical factories? Will a distributed web of gifteconomies, barter systems, and complementary currencies create diverse, thrivingartisan communities, or will Road Warrior Armageddon rule after the collapse ofthe debt-laden free market?It’s my hope that an archipelago of permaculture gardens, ecovillages, andorganic farms can help stave off potential global-warming famines and GMOcontamination; that we can forge new initiatory systems and educational paths toresurrect the depleted spirit of our youth; that a network of healers, shamans,yogis, and tantric masters will serve as spiritual mid-wives to bring aboutplanetary ascension and, perhaps, an introduction to our galactic neighbors; andthat rising human awareness can end the destructive patterns and karmic wreckagefrom several thousand years of systematized violence—healing our water, land,sky, and hearts.I know that my hopes for an energetically synchronized network that can shiftreality on a global scale represents the mother of all Hail Mary passes—a divineJoe Namath long shot that depends upon miracle after miracle occurring. Becauseof my own awakening process and from hearing the numerous tales ofsynchronicities from Sporeganizers in the Evolver Social Movement, I at leasthumor the idea that this type of magical activism is possible. Perhaps we are atthe beginning of a wave of these transcendent revelations, and much more liesahead. There is no way to tell if we are the pioneers of a visionary new age,whisking humanity into the high vibrations of an interdimensional love party, orpost-modern Don Quixotes attacking techno-industrial windmills with our flimsy,rolled-up yoga mats.Pondering all this on a January afternoon in Austin, I found myself repeating amantra I often recite when traveling the Evolver network, pursuing our missionto Find the Others. It comes from cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead, whosaid, “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens canchange the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.”I pray she is right."},{"pageContent":"[images/Phil_9781583943434_epub_022_r1.jpg]I’D LIKE TO THANK JADE for loving and supporting me throughout this journey andfor generously allowing me to put these stories into print; Rena for opening mylife to incredible healing and for instigating this adventure; Daniel Pinchbeckfor reshaping this book and encouraging me to be brutally honest about myexperiences, even the more bizarre galactic stuff; Ken Jordan for being a greateditor, mentor, and friend—this project wouldn’t have been possible without you;Fred Jordan for your meticulous care in reviewing the manuscript; MichaelRobinson for crafting the luminous cover image; Graham Hancock for sharing yourEgyptian pyramid stories and writing a thoughtful introduction; Doug Reil, ErinWiegand, Richard Grossinger, Kat Engh, and Janet Levin at North Atlantic Booksfor having the vision to publish this unusual memoir; Catherine Burns for beinga true confidante and revitalizing my belief in this material; Nelia Vishnevskyfor creating a great prototype cover image; Kate Raudenbush for staging a funafternoon author photo shoot; Elke Dehner for being a dear friend; SamanthaIbarguen for your guiding light; Adam Elenbaas for your friendship in “Christconsciousness”; and Bernadette Quattrone for all your joy and playfulness.To Barry Gordon and my bioenergetic healing class for giving me the educationI’d always hoped for; Maxine Brownstein for embracing me with the higherfrequencies of Reiki; Nat Bletter for taking me on magical odysseys; Jenne Magnofor bringing miracles into my life; Mom, Dad, my brother, and my sister forwelcoming the publication of this book and understanding the deeper healingprocess at work within the family tree; Souldish’s Salma Shamy for producing thebest spirit-raising events listing in NYC; Laura Marini, Frank Ciulla, and therest of the NYC Gnostics for our intrepid investigations; Andy, Nikki, and therest of The September 11th Fund’s Ongoing Recovery Program for taking on suchdifficult work; the patriots of Greene Dragon for engaging in our absurdistspectacles; Rusel Parish for whisking me off to the Big Apple; Wendy Tremaynefor trailblazing with Mikey; Justin Levy for your help in a time of difficulty;C.
