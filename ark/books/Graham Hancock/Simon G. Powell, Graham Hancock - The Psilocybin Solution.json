He posits Nature is a deliberate and intelligently behaving system,and he proposes that psilocybin, by altering the neurochemistry of the brain inspecific ways, enables novel patterns of information to emerge, allowing thepsyche to become a sort of conduit to the Other.

Nixon in June 1971. It is appropriate that thismisguided, morally bankrupt “war” of harassment against a sizeable minoritywithin society—those adults who choose to alter their own consciousness throughthe use of drugs—was the initiative of one of the most dishonest, violent, andauthoritarian presidents America has ever had the misfortune to elect, a man whostands enthroned by history as the absolute epitome of morally bankruptleadership. Forty years on, it is our shared misfortune, despite the opprobriumthat rightly surrounds Nixon’s name, that his “War on Drugs” is still beingfought not only in the United States but throughout the world—for where Americaled in 1971, all other members of the United Nations swiftly followed. Armedbureaucracies were established to police the consciousness of citizens and givenpowers to break down the doors of drug users in the middle of the night,confiscate their property, send them to jail, humiliate them, and generally ruintheir lives. In some countries they can even be executed. All this has beenaccompanied by years of glib propaganda, paid for with large sums of publicmoney, designed to convince us that drugs have such evil and degrading effects,and are so lacking in any redeemable qualities, that those who use them“deserve” to be persecuted and punished for their “sins.”It is a witch hunt, a moral panic, with nothing rational about it at all.Indeed the very societies that attempt most vigorously to suppress variousdrugs, and in which users are subject to the most stringent penalties, have seena continuous increase in the per capita consumption of these drugs over the pastforty years. This is tacitly admitted by the huge armed bureaucracies of thedrug war that every year demand more and more public money to fund theirsuppressive activities; if the suppression were working, one would expect theirbudgets to go down, not up.Worse—and we may all see the effects—the criminalization of drug use hasempowered and enriched a global criminal underworld by guaranteeing that it isthe only source of supply of these drugs. We have, in effect, delivered thatlarge minority within our societies that feels the need to experience alteredstates of consciousness into the hands of the very worst mobsters andsleazeballs on the planet. Those who wish to buy drugs have no choice but toapproach and associate with violent and greedy criminals. And because theproceeds from illegal drug sales are so enormous, we are all caught up in theinevitable consequences of turf wars and murders among the gangs and cartelscompeting in this blackest of black markets.It should be completely obvious to our governments, after forty years of dismalfailure to suppress illegal drug use, that their policies in this area do notwork and will never work. It should be completely obvious, a simple logicalstep, to realize that by decriminalizing drug use and making the supply of alldrugs available to those adults who wish to use them through legal and properlyregulated channels we could, at a stroke, put out of business the immensecriminal enterprise that presently flourishes on the supply of illegal drugs.It should be obvious, but somehow it is not.Instead the powers that be continue to pursue the same harsh and cruel policiesto which they have been wedded since 1971, ever seeking to strengthen andreinforce them rather than to replace them with something better. Indeed theonly “change” that the drug warriors have consistently sought across the decadeshas been to demand ever more money, ever more surveillance technology, ever morearms, and ever more draconian legislative powers to break into homes, confiscateproperty, and deprive otherwise law-abiding citizens of liberty. In the processwe have seen our once free and upstanding societies, which used to respectindividual choice, conscience, and adult responsibility above all else, slideremorselessly down the slippery slope that leads to the police state. And allthis is being done in our name, with our money, by our own governments, to “saveus from ourselves”!In such a climate riddled with propaganda and disinformation, overshadowed byfear and suspicion, where users of illegal drugs are vigorously persecuted bypublic agencies, it is very difficult, and takes courage, to speak out about thepossibly beneficial, mind-expanding, eye-opening, and consciousness-enhancingeffects of certain illegal drugs. That, however, is precisely what Simon G.Powell has done in The Psilocybin Solution, where he makes the case for nothingless than the systematic, targeted use of psilocybin and other naturalpsychedelics to explore the fundamental mysteries of our own existence.Psilocybin, Powell believes, has the power to open our consciousness to thecommunications of “the Other,” which he ultimately defines as the vast, guidingintelligence that underlies all of Nature and that has harnessed the entireuniverse to its cause—“a sentient and intentional agency made of informationwhose presence and teachings await us.” And he adds: “When one has encounteredthe Other through the visionary effects of a strong dose of psilocybin mushroomsit becomes quite evident that, whatever the Other’s ultimate intent,consciousness is an essential part of the plan.”There’s a widespread assumption that the brain makes consciousness the way afactory makes cars. But there’s no proof that this is actually how things work.The brain could equally well be a receiver, or transceiver, that manifestsconsciousness on the physical plane. We simply do not know how these few poundsof jelly inside our skulls allow us to appreciate a sunset or a symphony, orexperience love or joy. It’s the greatest mystery of science.Into this mystery Powell steps with the radical suggestion that everything isinformation and that all the information accumulated by the universe in thefourteen billion years since the big bang is best understood as a sort ofgigantic computation intentionally designed to result, somewhere, sometime, inthe evolution of consciousness—just as it has done on earth. Most proponents ofintelligent design focus on the apparent irreducible complexity of specificorgans or organisms—a losing proposition, since evolutionary theory explainscomplexity quite well without having to call for a designer. But Powell focusesmuch more plausibly on the grand context in which evolution unfolds. Thatcontext, he contends, can only be the work of an intelligence of a far higherorder than our own that wilfully endowed the universe with precursor conditionsand laws of physics capable of nurturing the eventual evolution ofconsciousness.These are provocative and powerful ideas that contribute to a growing debate inscience and philosophy about the mysterious nature of reality. And whilePowell’s thesis may be controversial, he is surely right that the targeted useof psilocybin and related entheogens offers our best hope for solving themystery. These substances must be demythologized as the folk devils of the waron drugs and welcomed as valuable allies in our search for meaning in theuniverse. In precisely those areas of inquiry where science and all itsinstruments fail us we are fortunate indeed that “the sacred mushroom nowbeckons.”Graham Hancock, born in Edinburgh, Scotland, is a British writer and journalist.His books, including Fingerprints of the Gods, The Sign and The Seal, andHeaven’s Mirror, have sold more than five million copies worldwide and have beentranslated into twenty-seven languages.

Tobe sure, it has been a very long and laborious struggle to reach this stage. Nowthat the book has finally been accepted for publication, I should say a fewbrief words about its admittedly unusual content. Essentially, I present thereader with a series of bold ideas and concepts concerning the nature of theuser-friendly Universe in which we find ourselves. In particular, I explore thesignificance of consciousness within the Universe, for consciousness is the verycore of our being. And it is precisely the very core of our being thatpsychoactive fungi can so dramatically illuminate. This may explain why suchfungi were more often than not venerated and deified by those historicalcultures that employed them.I have tried, to the best of my abilities, to make sense of my own personalexperiences with one particular psychoactive fungus native to Great Britain (ata time, I might add, when possession of this mushroom in its fresh state wascompletely legal). These experiences involved dramatic changes in consciousnessand the acquisition of what seemed to be a new kind of knowledge. Theexperiences were generally so profound as to make it difficult to integrate theminto more traditional modes of thought. And yet it is undoubtedly thisassimilation of what would appear to be higher knowledge that is so crucial ifthese kinds of experience are to have a lasting, positive effect. Hence mywriting of this book. However, it would be ludicrous for me to suggest that Ihave written the “truth,” for truth is something that must be experiencedpersonally. At heart, then, this book consists of a series of provisionalhypotheses about the meaning of life, which have been formulated in the wake ofcertain extraordinary states of mind. The experiences themselves were real andwere thus “true,” whereas, of course, my interpretation of them might well be inerror.One thing of which I am wholly convinced and that I should make clear at theoutset is that the ingestion of traditionally deified plants and fungi can, inthe long run, afford a benign change in our understanding and conception ofNature. It is evident that at the current time our relationship with the naturalworld is so alienated and so out of balance that only radical means may preventglobal catastrophe. In this sense the sacred mushroom is, at least potentially,a very powerful eco-psychological catalyst able to heal our relations with therest of the web of life. Of this, no one should be fearful.SIMON G. POWELLLONDON"},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/9781594779374_002.jpg]P R O L O G U EA Question of Life and DeathIt might be a decidedly curious way to begin a book, but humor me and askyourself the following question: Who or what killed Einstein? What entity orforce ended the life of perhaps the greatest mind of our era, that scientistwhose name is synonymous with intelligence? Well, it was clearly not a butlerwho did it, nor, as far as we know, was it an assassin belonging to somesinister governmental agency. To put it bluntly, it was the reality process thatkilled the great Einstein.Although this deceptively simple answer may seem reminiscent of a wry WoodyAllen joke, what I mean to convey is that all of us, regardless of age, sex,race, or creed, are born out of, and are destined to die within, a massiveongoing process consisting not only of the evolution of life on Earth but of theevolution of the Universe as a whole. It is this relentless and all-encompassingprocess within which we are all so intimately embedded that we term reality. Wemight also refer to this process as Nature. Thus, another obvious way ofanswering my peculiar question is to say that natural causes killed Einstein.This means, in the final analysis, that Nature birthed Einstein, gave himseventy-six years of existence, and then summarily dissolved him.Call it Nature or call it reality, either way they are but small words for animmense process that flows inexorably onward. Whatever one’s preferred term, itmost certainly is a process, a word whose Latin roots mean “to advance” or “moveforward,” and there can be little doubt that reality is, at heart, a singularlyvast process that has been running nonstop for some fourteen or so billionyears. Not bad. Pretty impressive, in fact.So what? you might ask. Well, one of the prime functions of this book is toexplore and hopefully elucidate the ultimate point of this creative but fatalreality we find ourselves in. To put it bluntly once more, are we biologicallywoven into a pointless accident, or is reality somehow directed? This is quitesome question, perhaps the most profound we can ask in our short earthlysojourn, and one we know to have crossed Einstein’s astute mind. Consider, forexample, a famous remark attributed to Einstein in which he claimed that themost incomprehensible thing about our Universe is its comprehensibility. What hemeant to convey by this rather sublime assertion (of which there are manyparaphrased versions) is that it is truly astonishing that Nature makes sense,whatever part of it we care to study. Law and order are everywhere, whether inthe domain of physics, chemistry, biology, or cosmology. Moreover, Nature hassomehow conspired, through a process of organic evolution, to build biologicalbrains endowed with minds capable of comprehending physical, chemical,biological, and cosmological phenomena. Why? Why exactly should Nature be thatway? Why should the Universe be endowed with the creative capacity to constructmillions of spiral galaxies and millions of delicate spiral seashells, as wellas the human brain with its ability to perceive and understand those things?Could reality have been otherwise?Whatever the case, should we believe the reality process to be essentially amindless accident that just happens to be blessed with extraordinary powers ofcreativity, then we might conceive ourselves to be hapless mortal prisonersentrapped in the process. Or, if we instead believe reality to be purposeful andmeaningful in some way, then we might consider ourselves fortunate functionalcomponents of the process. Whatever you may have read, let me assure you thatthis issue has most definitely not been settled. It is neither completelyobvious that the Universe is a purely accidental affair nor is it clear that theUniverse is purposeful (or at least one can say that the jury is still out).Neither science nor religion—arguably the two dominant strands of thinking thattend to confront the fundamental nature of reality—has absolutely conclusiveevidence at hand.But if we look to science for clues—because science has enjoyed more evidentpractical success than religion—then clearly over the past three hundred or soyears since the time of Newton and the development of classical physics, sciencehas made great headway in elucidating how reality works; not why it works, buthow. Because the process of reality is so obligingly comprehensible, science hasenjoyed a dialogue with Nature in which operating principles have beenascertained by means of scientific experimentation. In this way, scientists likephysicists, chemists, biologists, and cosmologists have acquired a wealth ofinformation concerning the subatomic, chemical, biological, and astronomicalaspects of reality and have subsequently built elaborate models detailing them.However, how one interprets the language of Nature, how one translates the datacollated by science into a theory about the ultimate nature of reality, is asubjective affair very much up for debate. Thus, our big opening question awaitsa satisfactory answer, and Einstein’s killer remains very much on the loose.At heart, if we wish to know what, if anything, the reality process is really upto, we can do little more than assess all the relevant information revealed byscience and all the intuitive wisdom accrued through personal experience, andthen attempt to form a viable theoretical overview. Absolute truths, it wouldseem, are all but inaccessible, and thus the true nature of Einstein’s creatorand killer might forever remain a mystery. But, whatever we believe about thereality process, we are, willy-nilly, most definitely all “in it together”whether we like it or not, and it is for this terrifying or wonderful reasonthat I have taken it upon myself to explore by any means necessary just what itis exactly that is driving reality, whether the driver is blind or has vision.Before I reveal to you my particular mode of investigation, let us brieflyreview what most of the science community believe to be the essential meaning ofexistence. As it is, current scientific thought definitely veers toward apurposeless and mechanistic account of the Universe, an account that is, withall due respect, depressing and devoid of spirit. Although our scientificknowledge of the world reveals its microscopic and macroscopic complexity andhighlights the universal mathematical precision of things like physical law,this knowledge has in effect reduced the Universe to a kind of pointlessmechanism devoid of high intelligence apart from our own. Everything from a cellto an orchid to the emergence of our species is generally reduced to a set ofmerelys. Indeed, the more successful a scientist is in reducing whatever facetof Nature he or she is working on to “merely this” or “merely that,” the morewarmly is that scientist’s work received. To argue otherwise by, say, suggestingthat Nature is purposeful in some way, is to ostracize oneself from mainstreamscience. Certainly it is the case that nobody will win a Nobel Prize forplanting purpose in Nature, despite the uplifting appeal that such anintentional theory of reality would undoubtedly carry.But is it valid to build a new and overtly optimistic theory concerning theultimate nature of reality solely because our current theories are not upliftingenough? Obviously not. A new theory like this would represent nothing more thanwhim, a psychological artifice formulated solely because the consensus truthabout reality is perceived to be too gloomy and too unpalatable to swallow.Indeed, to enthusiastically infer, say, that conscious existence has some kindof special purpose in the reality process, that consciousness is somehow at thecenter of an intentional Universe, smacks of the prescientific beliefs confinedto the pages of history books, to a time when supernatural thinking governedhuman minds. This kind of anthropocentric religious ideology has now been allbut crushed by rational scientific thought, which firmly places our kind on amere satellite circling a mere star among billions. We are no more than theproduct of evolution, one particular species out of countless millions, whoseonly real claim to fame is our big brains with their ability to think and directcomplex behavior.Over a few centuries, in particular from the seminal publication of CharlesDarwin’s The Origin of Species in 1859 (which can be cited as a definitiveturning point in our concepts of humankind’s place in Nature), the ideologicalpendulum has swung 180 degrees, from a position in which humanity was thecrowning glory of creation to a position in which we are but speckish organicbystanders in an essentially pointless universal exercise of physics andDNA-orchestrated biochemistry. Life is accidental, mostly hard, and then youdie—a tough fact best swallowed, perhaps, with a large brandy.To revert to the more ancient view in which life, and in particular humanconsciousness, is considered to be somehow significant therefore seemscompletely out of the question, a futile move serving only to stir up false hopein a Universe that basically “just don’t give a damn.” This is especially so ifour sole motivation is a dislike of current scientific reasoning. Only if agrand optimistic view of existence were driven primarily by direct consciousexperience could it possibly hope to possess validity. And not just wishy-washyconscious experience either. The experience, if it were to bear upon notions ofthe ultimate nature of reality, would have to be remarkably compelling andpotentially accessible to all. It would have to provide incontrovertibleevidence that we have some significant role to play in the reality process. Butcould a direct conscious experience really afford a deep insight into our bigquestion?Well, if we keep in mind that science proceeds through verifiableexperimentation in which information is gained through conscious experience andthat we depend upon such experience to build our models of reality, then itwould indeed appear to be a possibility. In other words, new forms of consciousexperience might well offer us a solution to the most perplexing questions thatthe Universe presents us with. Which brings me to the central fact permeatingthis book, namely that conscious experience is entirely mutable. And herein lieshope for a new optimistic theory concerning the significance of humanconsciousness within the reality process.The mutability of consciousness: What does such a concept imply? First of all,we should consider the fact that consciousness, whatever it is exactly, is the“stuff ” that mediates all science and, for that matter, all types of reasoningand all of our theories about the world. Whatever a person’s view on the meaningof existence, it is through conscious experience that all views are formed.Consciousness can therefore be understood as the very ground of our being, the“X factor” that makes us what we are. In order to become fully engaged in theimportant point I am here trying to express, consider the following simplethought experiment.Imagine, if you will, that all scientists wore identical spectacles and thatthese spectacles determined the perceptual view of the things being scrutinizedby the scientists. All the data amassed by these scientists would be related insome intimate way to the effects of their spectacles, since all theirperceptions will have passed through the self-same lenses. Now, it isn’t pushingcredulity too far to suggest that the scientists would do well at somepoint—possibly over their morning coffee break, or perhaps at a stage when theirtheories are proving to be inadequate—to reflect on the characteristics of theirshared state of “bespectacledness.” In other words, it would be quite abreakthrough for these scientists to suddenly cease their traditional researchin order to focus on the nature of the factor mediating their research, namely,their glasses. What they would soon come to realize is that their glassesrepresent a subject worthy of analysis because they are, in a real sense, theclosest thing to them.This imaginary situation is not unlike the real world, only this time it is ourconsciousness, or rather our state of consciousness, as opposed to glasses,through which we gain knowledge and experience. For simplicity’s sake, we cancall this “normal consciousness,” a kind of shared lens through which scienceand scientific interpretation proceeds. Thus, it is quite legitimate to reflecton this “lens of normal consciousness” and ask whether, perhaps, it could bealtered or be enhanced. In short, one might well wonder if it is possible toimprove on the lens of normal consciousness and attain a state of mind in whichthe essence of Nature is more clearly discernible.Although one cannot escape these rather odd facts about consciousness, sciencehas had little to say about it, preferring to place the human mind safelyoutside of the theoretical picture of reality. Put simply, the phenomenon ofhuman consciousness is a scientifically slippery and vexing anomaly that is instark contrast to the more empirically approachable phenomena of, say, stars andmolecules. Yet since we are conscious beings whose minds literally interfacewith the external world, then until we understand the nature of the “mind-stuff” carried by our brains, we will not be able to fully comprehend the nature ofthe reality process. This must be so because, as we have just established,consciousness is itself as much a part of reality as are the things perceived byconsciousness, such as the aforementioned stars and molecules. Indeed, if wewere not conscious beings, we would not be in a position to seek explanationsabout the nature of reality in the first place. It is only because we areconscious and because we stand in a mindful relationship to the reality processthat we feel compelled to account for our existence. Our conscious minds longfor knowledge about the Universe so that we might understand both our placewithin the totality of existence and the natural forces that led to our beinghere. Hence the enterprise of science (which means “to know”).Now, as I will show throughout this book, consciousness is mutable because it ismediated by chemistry, which is to say that mutable or transformable chemicalprocesses underlie consciousness. In effect, this means that our normal ways ofthinking and feeling are constrained by the brain’s chemical hardware (orwetware, as it is sometimes called in neuromantic circles). It is thereforeconceivable that certain aspects of the world remain hidden because of thelimitations of our everyday type of consciousness. Thus, if we truly wish tograpple with the ultimate questions concerning the nature of our existence, thenit is surely worthwhile to seek out new forms of perception, forms, forinstance, in which all of perceived reality is grasped at once, holistically asit were, and not in the piecemeal fashion of science, which, it must be said,tends to focus on isolated parts of the world.Historically speaking, altered forms of consciousness in which the whole senseof reality is immediately discerned and felt in a kind of joyous flash ofinsight are the sole domain of mystics, those persons who claim, rathercontroversially and often with alarming vigor, to have directly experienced“ultimate truths.” Many mystics and religious visionaries have employed varioustechniques with which to foster their insights—like fasting, yoga, meditation,perceptual isolation, and so forth—and these disciplines are known to alterbrain chemistry. This again testifies to the fact that the normal human brain issomehow constrained in its mindful activity and that the chemical system thatdoes the constraining can be overcome. For most of us, such esoteric endeavors,regardless of whether they do actually yield valid knowledge, are perhaps alittle beyond our normal way of life, and we might therefore wish to stick withless suspect nonmystical science for answers to the big questions about reality.However, there is another, more immediate route to transcendental knowledge, asit is termed in philosophy. This route involves the deliberate ingestion ofnaturally occurring entheogenic (sacred) plant and fungal alkaloids in order toaccess information inaccessible to the normal mind. Traditionally, thislittle-documented enterprise is engaged in by shamans, or native healers, whooften employ entheogenic flora to gain transcendental knowledge, which theyutilize for the benefit of their culture (note that the term entheogenic, whichI use throughout this book, means the “generation of the divine within”).To this day, aboriginal shamans in places like Amazonia and Mexico still utilizethe powerful effects of indigenous entheogenic plants and fungi to fulfill theirshamanic healing role within their native culture. So strong can therevelational effects of such plants and fungi be upon the human psyche that theygenerally come to be deified. Earth’s entheogens become a sacred link todivinity, almost as if they represent an organic modem connected directly to therealm of the gods. This was what luminary Aldous Huxley was alluding to somesixty years ago in his cult classic The Doors of Perception, in which hepoetically describes the fantastic perceptual enhancement that accompanied hisingestion of mescaline, an entheogenic alkaloid derived from the peyote cactus.It is precisely because entheogenic plants and fungi facilitate states ofconsciousness in which Nature is perceived in a radically new way that makesthem useful epistemological tools (epistemology is the study of knowledge). But,more than this, these kinds of illuminating changes in consciousness also offerus a way to understand consciousness itself, since one can analyze the subtlechemical changes accompanying the altered state of mind and then attempt to usesuch data to comprehend how normal consciousness works. Thus, the virtue ofinvestigating the effects of entheogenic substances is twofold.First, through their dramatic action within the brain we might come to perceiveNature in an enhanced way. Second, we might come to understand more about theunderlying chemistry that is bound up with normal conscious processes, that is,the modus operandi of entheogenic substances reveals the delicate chemicalmechanisms that govern consciousness and our perceptions of reality. If, throughthe use of entheogens, we can enhance our understanding of the interface betweenthe mind and the “world out there,” then we shall know more clearly whatconsciousness is, how it is formed, and how it can come to experiencetranscendence. And if the transcendental information accessed in the alteredstate of consciousness has any truth value—and native shamans all testify tothis—then we will be one step closer to an overall conception of what is drivingreality. Only then might we apprehend Einstein’s creator and killer, for then wewould have begun to establish its ultimate nature. At least it sounds promising.It is my contention throughout this book that naturally occurring entheogenicplants and fungi are indeed the key to solving the twin mysteries ofconsciousness and reality. Once ingested, entheogens are intimately involvedwith the bridge between consciousness and the world around us. The numinousexperience that entheogenic agents can induce, no matter how bizarre it mightappear in the context of the mundane world and no matter what brain mechanismunderlies it, is a real thing; it exists, potentially at any rate. As we shallsee, the archetypal tale of transcendence reported by entheogen-using shamansresults from direct and verifiable experience.It is on the basis of such verifiable experience that this book rests. Theapparent capacity of the human mind to transcend “normal” reality demandsinvestigation, for it must surely be a tenable step toward reclaimingsignificance for the existence of human consciousness in the Universe. However,if such an enterprise is spurious and built of no more than ephemeralimagination, then it will only point to the fact that the human imaginationunder certain chemical circumstances is extraordinarily creative. But it is mybelief that entheogenic agents unleash a form of consciousness better able tograpple with the ultimate questions about the reality process than our normalframes of awareness, that they truly offer us a glimpse of some great meaninghitherto the sole domain of the shaman and the mystic, a meaning only alluded toin the conventional religions of the world.As I see it, if we are genuinely interested in the function of the Universe andthe function of human consciousness within it, then we are obliged to follow alland any paths of inquiry. I would suggest that the untrammeled path laid out byentheogenic plants and fungi is, perhaps, the most viable route to evidence thatindicates that human consciousness is central to reality. If, instead, thisunusual path should prove to lead nowhere, then we may have to accept that humanlife and human consciousness are devoid of any real purpose, a view proffered,it must be said, by all manner of “experts.” This book can therefore be read asan alternative, user-friendly guide to the nature of reality, the implicationsof which herald all manner of good news. Very good news indeed.So stand by for a controversial tale of a recently rediscovered entheogenicsubstance native to most parts of the Earth’s Temperate Zone. And brace yourselffor the astonishing insights into mind and Nature that this substance provokes.Fasten your seat belts, because if I have done my job correctly, you are poisedfor a roller coaster ride into the very heart of the mystery of existence. Asthe chapters unfold we will gradually climb up to a peak, from which point wewill be propelled through exhilarating vistas in which the significance ofconsciousness is breathtakingly apparent. By the end of the book, I hope to haveshown, beyond any reasonable doubt, that the reality process is essentiallysmart through and through and that we conscious beings have a privileged role toplay in its intentional unfolding. I assure you that this will become crystalclear as the chapters progress."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/9781594779374_002.jpg]O N ESacred GroundOn May 13, 1957, the well-read pages of Life magazine carried a ground-breakingarticle that was to profoundly alter the West’s attitude toward the wilder sideof the natural world. Here was the first-ever personal account written by aWesterner describing the extraordinary psychological effects induced by amushroom deified and ritually worshipped by native Mexicans. Consumption of thesacred Mexican mushroom allowed one to contact the gods, experience profoundvisions, and gain mystical knowledge. Or at least these were the mostextravagant of the native Mexican beliefs about the mushroom that were reportedby anthropologists during the first half of the twentieth century.In pre-Columbian times the mysterious mushroom had been known by the Aztecs as“God’s Flesh,” testifying to its divine potency. Such veneration ensured themushroom a cult status among native Mexicans, despite the violent culturalupheavals wrought by the Spanish Conquest in the sixteenth century. Thus,although the once-mighty Aztec culture was eventually destroyed, the sacredmushroom continued to be used in and around Mexico throughout the Spanishoccupation. Yet despite the legendary effects of this peculiar species offungus, it wasn’t until the middle of the twentieth century that an outsideinvestigator finally consumed the mushroom and hence verified its allegedspiritual potential.Transmitted solely by word of mouth from the time of the Spanish Conquest,detailed knowledge of the revered mushroom had lain principally in the hands ofjealously guarding shamans or native healers, who were loath to disclose theirbotanical secrets to outsiders. They feared, perhaps justifiably, that thesacred mushroom’s supernatural power would be diminished or be used profanelyshould the untrustworthy white folk gain full admittance into its livingmystery. Therefore the 1957 Life article in which the secret of the mushroom wasopenly exposed dramatically symbolized the West’s bypassing of thislong-standing cultural security system. The sacred mushroom had been forciblyplucked from its localized shamanic niche and was now being presented to theWestern world in the form of mass-circulated print, with color photographs andspecimen drawings to boot.Despite exposure to the prying eyes of the West, the status of the Mexicanmushroom remained as lofty and as tantalizingly ethereal as ever, more so evensince the Western psyche was just as stunned and awed by its transcendentalvisionary effects as were local Mexicans. In the following decades a psychedelicmushroom cloud of fascination would slowly expand and loom beyond Mexico,eventually extending its magical influence as far away as Europe, but at thisinitial stage in its sudden growth, the strange mushroom remained a purelyMexican phenomenon.On the front cover of that auspicious edition of Life magazine, the simpleheadline read “The Discovery of Mushrooms That Cause Strange Visions,” a ratherunusual claim from such a traditionally conservative magazine. The article wasincluded as part of Life magazine’s series of Great Adventures and was writtenby R. Gordon Wasson, vice-president of a Wall Street banking firm, who, with theaid of his wife, Valentina, had spent some thirty years of part-time researchcreating a new scientific discipline—ethnomycology, the study of the culturaland historical use of fungi.Ethnomycology is clearly specialized and seemingly remote from the affairs ofmodern culture. It was only through the dedicated efforts of the Wassons—wholearned of the sacred Mexican mushrooms, sought to find them, and experiencedthem firsthand—that psilocybin (the as-yet unnamed active constituent of themushroom, pronounced silla-SIGH-bin) came to the attention of the West. Once thesacred Mexican mushrooms were discovered, ethnomycological science suddenlyacquired a distinctly mystical edge, allowing it to breach the domains ofreligion and psychology. It also provided a new impetus to humankind’s enduringquest to access transcendental knowledge, and there can be no doubt thatWasson’s discovery and vivid description of the effects of psilocybin werecrucial in generating the subsequent cultural wave of psychedelicexperimentation that soon followed in the 1960s. Moreover, as we shalleventually see, the mushroom also reveals itself as the key to unveiling thesecrets of consciousness and the hidden riches of Nature. Theophany, mind, andreality: these three most profound of topics are all met in some way through useof the mushroom. But, before we jump into the deep end, who, pray, was thisWasson fellow, this financiercum-adventurer? And how had he come to penetratethe Earth’s secret psychedelic dimension? Who was he to bring news of sacredfungi to the attention of the Western world?In effect, Wasson’s Life article was timed to coincide with the release of hismagnum opus two-volume book Mushrooms, Russia and History, cowritten with hiswife, Valentina. This work fully reveals the extent of Wasson’s long-standinginterest in the cultural use of fungi and how he finally came to be at the doorof perception marked psilocybin.With only 512 handcrafted copies luxuriously bound and printed, Mushrooms,Russia and History stands as a rare piece of art. Indeed, by the late 1970s itsvalue had reached some $2,500, making it the most valuable book in existence atthat time whose author was still alive. It is a highly polished book, written ina lively style that reflects the love of ethnomycology borne by the Wassons. Itrepresents the distilled wisdom drawn from their extensive studies into the rolethat various species of mushroom played in different cultures, and it culminatesin their discovery of the sacred mushroom ceremonies still being conducted inMexico, a discovery important enough to warrant the further account in the moreaccessible pages of Life magazine.A Trail BeginsThe event that originally launched the Wassons on their mushroom crusade wassimple, almost trivial, yet it was enough to provoke them into athree-decade-long bout of invaluable research. The Wassons married in 1927, andone day during their honeymoon they decided to take a casual stroll in theCatskill Mountains of New York. At some stage, Valentina, who was Russian bybirth, stopped to pick wild mushrooms, delighting in such a fortuitous find. Herhusband, on the other hand, being true to his Anglo-Saxon heritage, was appalledat his wife’s avid interest in lethal fungal abominations, especially since sheplanned to cook and eat them later. After all, were not all fungal growthspoisonous toadstools to be avoided like the plague? With growing dismay, GordonWasson imagined himself waking up the next morning with a corpse instead of awife.This pronounced and deep-rooted difference in attitude between the two of themover the culinary virtues of fungi led them to suspect a cultural rift, thatthere were mycophobic peoples (sensible mushroom haters like the Anglo-Saxons)and mycophilic peoples (reckless mushroom aficionados like the Russians).Furthermore, the Wassons reasoned that there must be a historical reason forthese diametrically opposed traditions, due not to something like foodavailability, but rather to cultural and psychological factors. Thus began theWassons’ academic quest to explore this strange cultural anomaly. From the startboth figured that religion somehow played a causal role.Their intuition proved correct. Research soon unearthed the Siberian culturalhistory of the Amanita muscaria mushroom, also known as fly agaric, thatextraordinary bright red and white-spotted autumnal fungus found throughout theNorthern Hemisphere and often charmingly depicted in the illustrations adorningthe pages of children’s books. Indeed, it has been suggested that Lewis Carrollwas influenced by knowledge of the Siberian use of the fly agaric and used theinformation to great effect in his book Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, inwhich, you might recall, Alice nibbles on a mushroom that subsequently altersher size.As we shall see, compared with the psilocybin mushroom, the fly agaric’spsychoactivity rates a poor second, though it is potentially entheogenic due tothe presence of an alkaloid named muscimol. Despite muscimol’s entheogenicinferiority to psilocybin, the cultural role and use of the fly agaric mushroomamong Siberian shamans is beyond dispute, and the Wassons uncovered a wealth ofliterature testifying to this fact. The fly agaric mushroom proved to be a linkto primitive religion just as the Wassons had originally foreseen, and it soonbecame clear to them that psychoactive fungi were no small feature of culturalhistory.Echoes of a Shamanic BeatSince the time of Tsar Peter the Great (1672–1725), the Kamchatka Peninsula, theeasternmost part of Russian Siberia, was visited by travelers, political exiles,explorers, fur traders, and anthropologists. All were to bear witness to thenomadic reindeer herders who ritually ingested fly agaric mushrooms (their onlyintoxicant) in order to obtain contact with the spiritual dimension. The wordshaman itself derives from the Siberian Tungus saman, which means “diviner,”“magician,” “doctor,” “creator of ecstasy,” “the mediator between the humanworld and the supernatural world.”The Siberian fly agaric user would sun-dry the mushrooms and later ingest themeither alone or mixed with milk or water. If taken alone, the mushroom wouldfirst be moistened in the mouths of women, who would produce a kind of pelletfor the shaman to swallow.The effects of consuming this mushroom included convulsions, delirium, visualhallucinations, perceptual distortions of size, feelings of superhuman strength,and a perceived contact with a numinous dimension, this last effect being themost important for the practicing shaman, whose predominant function was toaccess the spiritual realm to attain supramundane knowledge for the good healthof his or her tribe.The most bizarre aspect of this shamanic tradition, however, was the habit ofurine drinking. Somehow, the Siberians discovered that the active ingredient ofthe mushroom passed through the body without being metabolized and that drinkingfly-agaric-spiked urine could prolong intoxication. Possibly the Siberianslearned of this odd fact by observing reindeer, which not only reputedly eat thefly agaric themselves with much gusto, but also have an equal passion for humanurine, so much so that Siberian reindeer herders considered it dangerous to peeout in the open!The rather disturbing and unpalatable practice of drinking psychoactive urineattained great significance in Wasson’s later work in the 1960s, as urinedrinking is mentioned in the Rig-Veda, the ancient religious scripture of India.Written in Sanskrit and derived from the oral traditions of the Indo-Europeanswho migrated down into the Indus Valley some three and a half thousand yearsago, the Rig-Veda eventually went on to influence the development of Hinduism.Of the one thousand holy hymns in the Rig-Veda, more than one hundred arededicated solely to the divine plant Soma and its spectacular psychologicaleffects. Because urine drinking is clearly alluded to in these hymns deifyingSoma, Wasson came to the conclusion that the fly agaric mushroom was the sacredSoma worshipped by the ancient Indo-Europeans. Indeed, in parts of India,followers of the Vedic tradition still perform a religious ceremony in whichSoma is ingested, only they now utilize an inactive surrogate species of plant.Wasson’s identification of Soma was, at the time he made the claim, one of onlya handful of serious attempts to explore and name the legendary Soma plant. Tothis day his identification is considered plausible by many Vedic scholars.Mushroom LoreThe shamanic use of fly agaric mushrooms by primitive Siberians seemed to datefar back in history, as various legends spoke of its mythical origins. Forinstance, a Koryak legend tells of a hero named Big Raven who was able to attainimmense strength by eating spirits given to him by the god Vahiyinin—the god ofexistence. By spitting upon the earth, Vahiyinin caused the necessary spirits togrow, these being fly agaric mushrooms with their ability to providesupernatural strength and wisdom.The Wassons theorized that it was this archaic shamanic practice of fly agaricingestion, so well reflected in legend and mythology, that eventually led to themycophobic pre-Christian taboos against eating mushrooms, which were stillevidently shared by most of the peoples living around the shores of the NorthSea. In other words, because the fly agaric mushroom was used mainly by shamansin a ritual context, cultural injunctions and taboos would conceivably haveevolved to stop others wantonly utilizing its strange power. Or, it is just aslikely that through migrations and invasions, misinformation spread regardingthe true nature of the mushroom’s effects. Through such typical culturalmechanisms as these, the psychoactive fly agaric mushroom gradually came toattain a mythical status, guaranteeing it cultural immortality as it progressedas the stuff of legend from generation to generation.The shamanic use of fly agaric diffused out from Russia, and while some peoplesgradually came to eschew the mushroom, others embraced its effects. Not only didthe Aryan people who migrated down into the Indus Valley thirty-five hundredyears ago bring with them their religious cult of Soma, later still,approximately 1000 B.C., we find artistic representations of mushrooms onSwedish, Norwegian, and Danish Bronze Age objects. On bronze artifacts likerazors are mushroom motifs (generally stylized cross-sectional views of amushroom) that depict the mushroom in a way that suggests that it was an objectof worship. Because the fly agaric mushroom abounds in Scandinavia, these motifsare thought to represent a fly-agaric-worshipping cult similar to those ofSiberia.Apart from Siberian folklore, many European folktales testify to the enigma ofthe fly agaric mushroom, providing an echo of the distant culturalinterconnections of the past. Stories arising from the region once known asYugoslavia take the mushroom’s supernatural origin back to the time ofpre-Christian Nature gods. A legend relates that Votan, chief of all the godsand a potent magician and healer, was riding his magical horse through thecountryside when demons suddenly appeared and started chasing him. As he fled,his horse galloped so fast that flecks of bloodied foam flew from its mouth.Wherever this bloody foam fell, fly agarics sprang up.Hungarians once called the fly agaric boland gamba or the “mad mushroom.”Austrians and Germans used to speak of the “fool’s mushroom” and were wont torespond to peculiar behavior with the phrase “have you eaten crazy mushrooms?”The Wassons also analyzed the vast array of words used to describe mushrooms indifferent cultures and the latent metaphors that these words conveyed; wordslike toadstool, for instance, which links the toad to the mushroom, the toadbeing a creature much maligned in myth and folklore. The Wassons alsoconjectured that the fly in fly agaric was not a reference to its supposedinsecticidal effect; rather, the common insect used to be associated withdemonic power (Beelzebub is “Lord of the Flies”) and was thus fearfullyassociated with the mysterious mushroom.In short, the Wassons uncovered a vast cultural diffusion of mushroom loreindicative of a common origin. The psychoactive fly agaric mushroom seemed mostlikely to be the instigator. Wasson later summed up his views in the followingway in his book Soma: Divine Mushroom of Immortality.Death will come if the layman presumes to eat the forbidden fruit, the Fruit ofKnowledge, the Divine Mushroom of Immortality that the . . . poets of theRig-Veda celebrated. The fear of this “death” has lived on as an emotionalresidue, long after the shaman and his religion have faded from memory, and hereis the explanation for the mycophobia that has prevailed throughout northernEurope, in the Germanic and Celtic worlds.1 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts1]At this point the Wassons might well have ended their mycologicalinvestigations, an interesting enough climax since they had left the fungalworld and ventured into the domain of primitive religion. The plot, however, wasgoing to thicken as the fly agaric became overshadowed by the far more powerfulfigure of the psilocybin mushroom, a mushroom whose living mystery Wasson wouldeventually confront within the inner sanctums of his soul.Intimations of a Sacred Mexican MushroomIn 1952 an acquaintance of the Wassons, the noted poet and historical writerRobert Graves, wrote a crucial letter informing them of a supposed secretmushroom cult still in existence in Mexico. Graves included in his letter aclipping from a Canadian pharmaceutical journal that discussed finds made byRichard Evans Schultes years earlier. It transpired that Schultes, one of theworld’s leading ethnobotanists attached to Harvard, had, in 1938, identified aspecies of Panaeoleus mushroom as being the sacred sacrament allegedly employedby Mexican Indians. At that time, only this one entheogenic species had beenidentified by Schultes, and although a few European people had observed a nativeMexican mushroom ceremony, no outsiders had been permitted to partake of themushroom itself. This is significant, for without actually personallyexperiencing the psilocybin mushroom, one can only guess at its effects, andtherefore the early anthropological observations passed by without muchinterest.Once the Wassons learned of these intriguing facts, armed as they were withdetailed knowledge of fly agaric mushroom history and lore, it was only naturalfor them to heed Graves’s investigational indications and focus their attentionupon Mexico. If mushroom ceremonies were still being practiced, it would betestimony to the shamanic use of fungi not limited to the pages of history.Through associates, the Wassons were soon in avid correspondence with one EunicePike, an American linguistic student and Bible translator (in other words, amissionary) who had been living among Mazatec Indians in Huautla, Mexico, formore than fifteen years. Having become familiar with the native customs andbeliefs about certain sacred mushrooms, she was only too willing to share herknowledge with the Wassons.Pike informed the Wassons by letter that one Indian boy had referred to themushroom as a gift from Jesus, no less than the blood of Christ. The Indiansalso said that while it helped “good people,” it killed “bad people” or madethem crazy. Furthermore, the Indians were sure that Jesus spoke to them while inthe “bemushroomed” state. Everyone whom Pike asked agreed that they were seeinginto heaven itself through the mushroom.As well as highlighting the ongoing integration of the Christian faith intonative Indian culture, the Indians’ claims indicated that the mushroom washighly powerful in its psychological effect, able to induce a radical alterationof consciousness still relatively new to Western science. It was also clear thatthe normal procedure was for a shaman to eat the mushroom on behalf of another,usually in order to heal, this being the classic social function of the shamanfound in most of the world’s native cultures.Pike ended her informative and tantalizing letter by wishing that the nativeswould consult the Bible instead of resorting to consumption of the strangemushroom, a remark natural enough to anyone concerned with preaching the Bibleand unfamiliar with the psychological territory accessed through psilocybin. Butstill, is it not odd that someone so obviously religiously inclined, as thiswoman was, should not have detected something of spiritual importance in theIndians’ claims? If so many of them readily attested to the virtues of thesacred mushrooms, why did she not try them for herself? After all, she mentionsno harmful effects apart from the dangers of possessing a “bad heart.”What is the nature of this fear that would prevent a single open-mindedexperiment with such fungi? How can one claim to be fully religious and not takethe testimonies of shamans seriously? This was an anomaly that was tocontinually crop up in the relations between the Western psyche and themushroom. Psilocybin would come to generate absolute awe or absolute rejectionin those who confronted it, this being indicative that something significant isat work in the actual experience. If there was nothing of real interest to begained from visionary substances, if the experiences were purely limitedpersonal fantasies, then there would be no stimulational force with which togenerate enduring fascination. However, as I will show, many have claimed thatpsilocybin does offer great knowledge about our existence, that it can yieldsoulful insights into the nature of reality. This is why the psilocybin mushroomexperience has remained such an abstruse phenomenon and why opinions are sodivided.Sensing in Pike’s letter that there was indeed some great revelational discoveryto be made, the Wassons decided to travel as soon as possible to Huautla, and in1953 they did so. There could be no mistaking the aroma of the ethnomycologicalHoly Grail as they neared its living presence. As an aside, they also realizedthat to judge from Pike’s description, the mushroom being used by these Indianswas not the Panaeoleus species previously identified by Schultes. This wasfurther reason for prompt scholarly investigation.Getting WarmerBy August 1953 the Wassons had managed to enlist the help of a Mexicancurandero, or shaman, and this was an achievement in itself, as the Indians werereluctant to discuss the mushroom with outsiders. Under the pretense of wantingsupernaturally inspired news of their son, the Wassons were permitted to takepart in a mushroom rite during which the shaman would ingest sacred mushrooms inorder to gain the requested information. Unfortunately the shaman was the onlyperson allowed to consume the fungus, and the Wassons were forced to remainuninitiated.The shaman, under the effects of psilocybin, made three specific predictionsconcerning the Wassons’ son, which, at the time, he (Wasson) politely humored,as he had no real inkling into psilocybin’s latent ability to produce feats ofclairvoyance. His interest was, after all, still predominately academic, and anykind of supernatural utterances were to be taken with a large pinch of salt. Asit later transpired, all three of the shaman’s predictions were borne out, andWasson was at a loss to explain this. Was it coincidence? Or was it a genuinecase of the paranormal? Whatever it was, the mysterious mushrooms demandedcloser scrutiny, for they seemed to promise much more of interest. Wasson wasbeing drawn ever nearer, as his lifelong adventure drew to an epic climax.A fully detailed witness account of this mushroom ceremony was to be theculminating chapter of Mushrooms, Russia and History, though just as the bookwas going to press in June of 1955 a new breakthrough was made. In fact, it wasthe ultimate breakthrough and became the highlight of R. Gordon Wasson’sscholarly career. It also generated another chapter in his book and the seminalpiece for Life magazine. The middle-aged New York banker-turned-ethnomycologistbecame the first Westerner on record to deliberately consume sacred Mexicanmushrooms and behold their entheogenic glory. Wasson had sought, and finallyaccessed, one of the most remarkable experiences to be had upon this Earth.Thanks to his lifelong persistent efforts, humanity’s exploration of Nature andof the limits of conscious experience became suddenly enhanced as psilocybinmade its extraordinary psychedelic presence felt. Indeed, for our purposes, itis rather apt that our man Wasson was provided with an informative andilluminating experience at that time—almost an earthly calling card in fact—asonly a few months earlier Nature had consumed the great Einstein. At least itwas apt in a relative kind of way for anyone interested in thesubtle-yetnever-malicious force of such a wily killer/creator as Nature.The Mystery Explodes into LifeIn telling of his experiences in Life magazine, Wasson comes across as a kind ofPrometheus figure, bringing the world news of a hitherto secret gift of thegods. Among dreamy 1950s Technicolor photographs and numerous advertisements formiracle filter cigarettes and various brands of alcohol, Wasson’s article shineslike some otherworldly beacon signaling the awesome visionary power latentwithin the Mexican mushroom. We can only guess at the amazement that thisarticle must have evoked in the psyche of a reader soaked in 1950s thinking andvalues. This was the decade of Cadillacs, rock ’n’ roll, television, andelectronic gadgetry, a decade in which the postwar generation could live happilyupon the bountiful fruits of consumerism. Having recently conquered both Everestand the secret of the atom, humankind seemed truly on the ascent. Unlimitedatomic energy and unlimited material growth were in the cards. Nature had beentamed and set to work for our own ends.Of course, what no one realized at this time was the devastating effect upon theenvironment that an unchecked material culture could wreak. As yet unconceivedin holistic organismic terms, the natural environment was a place to take thekids on the weekend, not the grounds for concern, let alone the grounds for abizarre shamanic consummation. And, after all, weren’t shamans just primitivewitch doctors who spouted all sorts of unsophisticated nonsense? It musttherefore have been with some surprise that Life’s readers found themselvesbeing informed about visionary fungi, a facet of the environment still wild anduntamed and one that spoke of a very different kind of reality from that of theAmerican dream.Deep in the south of Mexico in a small village in Oaxaca, Wasson recounted tothe readers of Life how he had once more gained the confidence of a localshaman, a woman named Maria Sabina, under whose guidance he was allowed toingest sacred mushrooms. Judging from the photographs included in his account,the house where the ceremony took place was small and sparsely furnished, withvarious Christian icons on display. The paucity of modern furnishings, however,was in stark contrast to the luxuriousness of the visionary experience thatfollowed the ingestion of the mushrooms, the surroundings all but melting intoinsignificance.At 10:30 p.m. Wasson received six pairs of mushrooms from Maria Sabina as shecommenced the auspicious rite. At long last he held the elusive mystery in histrembling hands. Tangible and open to physical analysis, the fungi were nonative myth or figment of the imagination. But what of their legendary effect?All theory and hearsay became vanquished as Wasson swallowed his destiny.Like all good empiricists Wasson determined to remain objectively aloof and wardoff any major psychological effects so that he could study more clearly thenature of the revered shift in consciousness engendered by the mushroom. Asnoble as such efforts are, however, they generally prove futile in the face ofpotent entheogens, as one is forced to wholly succumb to the emergent globalalteration in mentation.As Wasson lay in the dark confines of the hut, the power latent within themushroom gradually made itself known to him. Visions unfolded before his eyes,visions so intense and so profound that they breached the ineffable realms ofreligious mysticism. They began as vividly colored art motifs of an angularnature, as found on textiles and carpets. Then the visions evolved intoresplendent palaces and gardens laid over with precious stones. At one point,Wasson perceived a great mythological beast drawing a regal chariot. Still laterit seemed as if his spirit had broken free from the constraints of his body andlay suspended in midair, viewing vast mountains rising to the Heavens. Wassonconfessed that the sights were so sharp and clear as to be more real thananything that he had previously seen with his eyes, somewhat akin to archetypesand the Platonic realm of Ideas.In Mushrooms, Russia and History, Wasson’s description of his visionaryexperiences is more explicit than in the Life piece. What had started out as aunique work of ethnomycology, touching on ancient Siberian shamanism, had nowtransformed into a personal testimony of the mystical experience. Coming from aman normally concerned with the world of finance, this is a truly remarkableturn of events, even more so since he was not overtly religious. It was also thecase that any of Wasson’s residual mycophobia had now been utterly obliterated,as the incontrovertible truth of psilocybin-induced shamanic ecstasy seized hissoul. The sense of awe, the sense that he had been witness to an event ofstaggering cultural significance radiates from these more detailed accounts, andthe book subsequently ends as a veritable mystical treatise.At one point during the mushroom ceremony Wasson thoughtthe visions themselves were about to be transcended, and dark gates reachingupward beyond sight were about to part, and we were to find ourselves in thepresence of the Ultimate. We seemed to be flying at the dark gates as a swallowat a dazzling lighthouse, and the gates were to part and admit us. But they didnot open, and with a thud we fell back, gasping.2[../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts2]Although the visions lasted only a minute or so by watch, Wasson noted that heexperienced them as having an aeonic duration, as though he had passed out ofthe confines of normal time. He was also certain that the visions originatedfrom either the unconscious or from an inherited source of racial memory,concepts borrowed from the work of Carl Jung, with which Wasson was obviouslyfamiliar. He readily conceded that the intense visionary episodes arose withinhim, yet they did not recall anything previously seen with his own eyes. Hewondered if maybe the mushroom visions were a subconscious transmutation ofthings read, seen, and imagined, so much transmuted that they appeared to be newand unfamiliar. Or, mused Wasson, did the mushroom allow one to penetrate somenew realm of the psyche?I assume here that Wasson was referring to something more than a personalunconscious and more like an organized field of intelligence or a transcendentalsentience of some sort, interpreted by native shamans as a Great Spirit or God.Wasson failed to elaborate on this matter, preferring to stick to moreacceptable ideas, and he ventured no further than Jungian territory in hisenthusiastic speculation.Wasson was also struck by the fact that the dazzling visionary materialengendered by the mushroom must reside somewhere within the mind, in a kind oflatent state, until the mushroom’s psychoactive constituents stirred them intoactivity. But how was it possible, he wondered, that we could be carrying aroundan inventory of wonders deep within us, wonders that the mushroom could unleashso spectacularly? Perhaps, he suggested, some creative faculty of the brain wasstimulated by the mushroom and this capacity for creative thought was somehowlinked to the perception of the divine.The visionary effects of the mushroom, so clearly related to the experiences ofreligious mystics, suggested to Wasson that these kinds of fungi might beconnected in some significant way to the very origins of the religious impulse,an idea he first introduced in the Life piece and one that he would constantlyreturn to for the rest of his life. Wasson asks us if perhaps the idea of adeity arose after our distant ancestors first consumed psychoactive mushrooms,surely a compelling scenario if we are pushed to explain the origins of religionin natural terms. He was later to help coin the contemporary word entheogen torefer to these sorts of plants and fungi, a word that, although devised to mean“becoming divine within,” is more often considered to mean “generating thedivine within.”Readers of the Life article were also informed as to what the Mexican Indiansthemselves had to say about the mushroom. The Indians claimed that the fungi“carry you there where God is.”3 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts3] Always themushroom was referred to with awe and reverence. It was not some common druglike alcohol to be taken at the drop of a hat in order to drown one’s sorrows ordeaden oneself to reality. On the contrary, native shamans used the fungus fororacular reasons to cure and prophesize. Wasson was intimately familiar with theIndians’ sacred traditions, and he was at pains to portray this culturalphenomenon to his readers in the respectful light it deserved. No Indian ate themushroom frivolously for excitement; rather, they spoke of their use as “muydelicado,” that is, perilous.A deeply inspired man, Wasson was not only the first Westerner to document thepsilocybin experience; he was also the first to attempt to account for themysterious effects in reasonable psychological terms, and his tentativespeculations remain valid. It is remarkable to think that had he not had such aprofoundly spiritual experience, or had his mind not been able to cope with theonslaught of a visionary dialogue, then the Mexican mushroom might well haveremained a buried phenomenon to this day. Fortunately for us, this was not so,and the entheogenic mystery is very much alive and “unleashed.” Indeed, giventhe current world situation in which relentless material consumption is rapidlydestroying the biosphere and our value systems are devoid of any vivifyingspiritual dimension, the sacred mushroom experience is now more relevant thanever before.Regarding Wasson’s brave attempts to provide a reasonable explanation for hisexperiences, I will deal with what is currently known about “theneuropsychological how” of psilocybin in later chapters. For now it is enough torecognize that the mushroom had proved itself to be the psychological analogueof physical fire, its effects able to innervate and enliven the very soul ofHomo sapiens.To simply dismiss Wasson’s visionary encounter as no more than the drug-inducedfantasy of a middle-aged man is to miss the point completely. The significanceof the entheogenic experience for psychological science alone is enough towarrant our attention since psilocybin is clearly able to galvanize highlyconstructive systems of thought and emotion into action—that much can be said atthe absolute least. Any substance able to evoke an organized flow of symbolicinformation seemingly issuing from somewhere outside of one’s sense of self, orego, has got to be worth studying, especially if the experience appears morereal than real. And as far as the actual experience of sacred transcendence isconcerned, if we are truly interested in such things, if we are truly concernedwith perceiving our existence in a way that is beyond the confines of aculturally conditioned secular perspective, then we should surely have cause toinvestigate the mushroom’s visionary potential. Whereas the most limitedexplanation for this psychological phenomenon in terms of, say, creativeimagination on an unprecedented scale, is still immensely important andfascinating, the more radical and speculative scenarios—which seem compellingwhen one has personally tasted exhilarating states of mind—offer an even greaterand more brilliant conceptual view of reality.It is here, in the personal impact of the psilocybin experience upon one’sperceptions of reality, that the importance of Wasson’s work resides, for he wasable to verbalize his entheogenic experiences in a way that captured theirremarkable character. Wasson had shown how sacred realms of experience were notdependent on churches or on the blessings of popes and priests, but could beaccessed through the consumption of entheogenic fungi. Wasson had effectivelylaid such a natural option at the feet of the modern world.At the end of his seminal account, Wasson discusses the accessibility of themushroom experience to large numbers people whose psychological dispositionmight not be in the same league as traditional visionaries like, for example,the poet William Blake. If Wasson was able to briefly become a visionary througheating a simple mushroom, no doubt others would want to follow suit. Thisinevitable social consequence of his tale was to become manifest in the nextdecade to a degree that he could never have anticipated, for his news ofvisionary fungi was instrumental in attracting the West’s interest towardentheogens. As Blake had written, once the doors of perception are opened, theinfinite beauty of reality can be discerned. Whether he had planned it or not,Wasson, like his contemporary Aldous Huxley, now had his foot firmly wedgedbetween those perceptual doors.image [../Images/9781594779374_003.jpg]As yet unnamed, its chemical structure still unknown, psilocybin thus began itsgradual infiltration of the modern technological world, flowing for the firsttime in and out of the nervous systems of Westerners, facilitating a spectacularkind of cerebral information processing in which the blazing divinity of Naturewas potentially discernible. The world would never be the same again asintellectuals, artists, and spiritual seekers with the aid of the psilocybinmushroom began scratching away at the restricted surface of normal everydayawareness. Such intrepid peering beyond the confines of routine perceptionseemed to reveal much, much more in the way of reality, allowing access toinformation of the most stimulating and enchanting kind, as if the mushroom wasable to offer up all of Nature’s best-kept secrets.Despite the widespread interest generated by his Life piece, Wasson later chose,perhaps wisely, to distance himself from the 1960s psychedelic hippie culture,revolving as it was around synthetic LSD. Instead, he concerned himself withinvestigating the role of the fly agaric mushroom in ancient Indo-European Somacults. He also went on to make invaluable contributions to our knowledge of theuse of psilocybin mushrooms by the Aztec and Mayan civilizations of ancientMesoamerica, and we shall now step briefly back in time to view these historicalentheogenic traditions before bringing the history of psilocybin fully up todate."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/9781594779374_002.jpg]T W OAn Ancient Form of CommunionThe discovery of the shamanic use of psilocybin among contemporary MexicanIndians was indicative of a sacred tradition that, although almost buried, hadits roots firmly set in the glories of past civilizations. In particular, themighty Aztec empire had been familiar with the mushroom, and the variousdocuments written by Spanish conquistadors almost five hundred years ago, whichmention mushroom use by the Aztecs, can be reanalyzed according to what we nowknow of the actual entheogenic experience. Psilocybin emerges as no mereincidental feature of the natural world, restricted to secretive and isolateduse; rather, its ritual role as a potent sacrament was overtly establishedwithin the very fabric of ancient Mesoamerican society. Until, that is, it cameunder the merciless gaze of the Catholic Spanish conquistadors.The Aztecs were an immensely powerful civilization whose cultural achievementsare ranked by some in the same league as those of ancient Egypt and Babylonia.Religious ideology permeated all aspects of Aztec society, driving them toconquest and expansion and giving rise to their infamous bloody human sacrificeson a scale that cannot fail to shock.Located in the Central Valley of Mexico, the Aztec capital Tenochtitlán (nowMexico City) reached its peak of power and magnificence immediately prior to thearrival of Hernán Cortés and his gold-rushing Spanish army in 1519. With theadvent of the Spanish conquest, all aspects of Aztec religion, including the useof the psilocybin mushroom, were systematically wiped out, condemned as devilishheresy.To the invading Spanish clergy, the Aztecs’ claim that certain mushrooms (sometwo dozen or so psilocybin-containing species are indigenous to Mexico) wereteonanácatl, or “God’s Flesh,” was to admit to some blasphemous unholycommunion. In the Roman Catholicism touted by the marauding conquistadors,communion with the divine was not based on personally revealed knowledge orgnosis. Absolutely not. Rather it was the case that “inside” informationconcerning the divine was considered acceptable only if one was connected to aformally established religious hierarchy within which one accepted, withoutquestion, its most cherished doctrines.In other words, the organized drive of Catholicism that descended upon the Aztecnation derived its power structure through force-feeding religious dogma to itsadherents. To openly question this dogma, or to criticize it, could and did meandeath five hundred years ago. One is therefore hard-pressed to conceive of amore heretical act than that of the Aztecs’ consumption of supposedly divinemushrooms. The Spanish Catholic clergy, eager to spread their faith, would havebeen utterly appalled at the concept of eating some foul and unsightly fungus inorder to facilitate divine communion. As we shall see, this negative reactionwas clearly reflected in the lively written Spanish accounts of Aztec customs.To be sure, the intense disgust generated within the orthodox religious minds ofthe Spanish priests echoes the hatred meted out to women accused of beingsatanic witches in medieval Europe, as they too were found guilty of possessingheretical botanical knowledge. Whereas the Aztecs employed psilocybin mushroomsto induce numinous states of consciousness, the witches of the Middle Agesachieved similar states of mind by utilizing plants like henbane and belladonna.Historically speaking, the spiritual use of plants and fungi tends to generatethe same blunt response in the male psyche of any monotheistic culture—namely,unremitting persecution. The Aztec religion succumbed to just such a fate.The Catholic Constabulary Take NoteThe Aztecs’ use of psilocybin is clearly revealed in many of the records made bySpanish chroniclers at the time of the conquest, who diligently recorded theirown observations and translated Aztec historical documents as well. Forinstance, during the coronation of Montezuma the second in 1502, we learn thatteonanácatl was consumed during the celebrations. Many war captives wereslaughtered to honor the new king, their hearts torn out and offered to thegods. After the grisly sacrifices, the celebrants were bathed in blood and thengiven raw psilocybin mushrooms to eat.Perhaps it was this kind of terrible juxtaposition that helped the finger ofheresy point toward the mushroom. After all, a mass bloody sacrifice followed bysome strange ritual fungal inebriation is a hellish concept to the West, yet itwas bound with the Aztecs’ desire to supplicate their pantheon of gods. Bloodspilled in the name of religion whether through war or sacrifice is,unfortunately, a kind of pious tradition that highlights the immense power ofthe religious impulse over the human mind and soul. The gods of the Aztecs weredeemed real, and they had to be worshipped and placated.At any rate, the Aztecs utilized psilocybin in their religious rituals andengaged in various other rites that would have appeared horrendously alien tothe invading Spanish, who were unlikely to react in the manner of refined socialanthropologists. The excessive sacrifices together with the ingestion ofpsychoactive mushrooms must have sorely confused the Spanish invaders. To besure, while they were at once amazed at the glorious wealth and regality of theAztec cities that they encountered, they were less enthusiastic about theunderlying psychological forces that had led to the physical magnificence set instone.Further accounts from the occupying Spanish clergy reveal the Aztecs’ use ofpsilocybin. The following testimonies—which paint a sometimes vivid picture ofAztec tradition—are detailed in Wasson’s The Wondrous Mushroom. For example,Diego Durán, a sixteenth-century Dominican friar translating a document inNahuatl (the language spoken by the Aztecs), writes of the coronation of Tizocin 1481:And all the lords and grandees of the provinces rose and, to solemnize furtherthe festivities, they all ate of some woodland mushrooms, which they say makeyou lose your senses, and thus they sallied forth all primed for the dance.1[../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts4]On the aforementioned coronation of Montezuma, Durán tells us:The sacrifice finished and the steps of the temple and patio bathed in humanblood, they all went to eat raw mushrooms; on which food they all went out oftheir minds, worse than if they had drunk much wine; so drunk and senseless werethey that many killed themselves by their own hand, and, with the force of thosemushrooms, they would see visions and have revelations of the future, the Devilspeaking to them in that drunken state.2 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts5]Because of his own personal experiences with psilocybin, and in light ofhistorical research that clearly showed the Aztecs’ reverence for teonanácatl,our mushroom expert Wasson came to the conclusion that Durán had imposed his ownviews on the matter in order to further demonize the mushroom practice. Which isto say that to identify the Devil at the heart of the psilocybin experience wasan interpretation peculiar to the psyche of this sixteenth-century friar. Withhis particular theological training he would have had no choice but to sniff thesulphurous traces of the Devil in the Aztecs’ unusual entheogenic rites. Durán’sperception of psilocybin-inspired suicides within the Nahuatl texts is thereforemore likely to be the result of bias and exaggerated translation than actualfact. Today’s tabloid press would doubtless be impressed by Durán’s sensationalrhetoric.Another friar, the Franciscan Bernardino de Sahagún, also left us an account ofnative mushroom use. In the Florentine Codex he writes of a merchant’scelebration.At the very first, mushrooms had been served. They ate them at a time when, theysaid, the shell trumpets were blown. They ate no more food; they only drankchocolate during the night. And they ate the mushrooms with honey. When themushrooms took effect on them, then they danced, then they wept. But some whilestill in command of their senses entered and sat there by the house on theirseats; they danced no more, but only sat there nodding.3[../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts6]On the face of it, this would seem to be a less prejudiced portrayal ofpsilocybin use, though in the following report, also by Sahagún, he soon slidesinto the familiar tabloidlike sensationalist mode while describing mushroom use.It is called teonanácatl. It grows on the plains, in the grass. The head issmall and round, the stem long and slender. It is bitter and burns; it burns thethroat. It makes one besotted; it deranges one, troubles one. . . . He who eatsmany of them sees many things which make him afraid, or make him laugh. Heflees, hangs himself, hurls himself from a cliff, cries out, takes fright.4[../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts7]Such scare stories are echoed by the rumors that surrounded LSD use in the1960s. People were supposedly hurling themselves from high-rise apartments andfoolishly attempting to stop highway traffic by the power of thought alone. Inactuality, of all the millions of doses of LSD taken in the 1960s, there wereonly a handful of deaths through misadventure resulting from LSD’s effects. Itappears that any psychedelic substance with a powerful mystique seems to instillfear in those who are unfamiliar with its effects and who are easily threatenedby the unknown. Moreover, fear often precedes persecution and the spreading ofinaccurate information, which is why it is so important to have an unconditionalflow of informed, hysteria-free knowledge regarding the psychological action ofvisionary plants and fungi. One hopes, then, that we live in more enlightenedtimes. The fact remains, however, that the Aztec use of psychoactive agents,which included the use of other entheogens like the morning glory plant (whoseseeds contain LSD-related compounds), proved to be so abhorrent to the Spanishthat they sought to drive all such practices to extinction.That they were successful in forcibly burying the mushroom is made clear by theacademic events in the early part of the last century, as it was erroneouslybelieved that there never were any psychoactive mushrooms to be found in Mexicoin the first place. It was assumed by scholars that a mistake had been made bythe obviously dim-witted Spanish historians, and that dried peyote cactusbuttons (containing the entheogenic alkaloid mescaline) were the legendaryteonanácatl. This botanical conjecture, or blunder as it was, went completelyunchallenged by the academic fraternity when it was presented in 1915, and itremained unchallenged until a species of psychoactive mushroom still being usedin Huautla was identified in 1938.Perhaps, then, we should conclude that mycophobia is not merely a culturalphenomenon, but a remorseless genetic trait. This is an idea that Wasson wouldcertainly have appreciated, as he was to come across much in the way ofscholarly disregard for psilocybin’s religious role within ancient Mesoamericanculture. It is only since Wasson’s work has come to be acknowledged thathistorians have begun to realize that psychedelic agents like the Mexicanmushroom have the power to move people, that their tremendous psychologicalimpact was significant in shaping the belief systems of those cultures that usedthem. The point that Wasson was continually at pains to make was that one shouldbe wary of underestimating the cultural and historical role of entheogenicflora, although, of course, he came to this conclusion by way of his ownpersonal psychedelic experiences. Alas, such personal insights are not shared bymost other Mesoamerican scholars.Illuminating FlowersOne of the most remarkable pieces of evidence testifying to the exalted statusconferred upon the psilocybin mushroom by the Aztecs is in the form of an earlysixteenth-century statue of the god Xochipilli, or the “Prince of Flowers.” Thesignificance of this magnificent piece of art was first recognized by Wasson,and thereafter the real message that it conveyed became glaringly apparent.The statue represents a cross-legged male figure—the god Xochipilli—caught up inan ecstatic trance. There can be no mistake. The very essence of ecstasy hasbeen captured in stone. The arms, legs, and base of this stone-carved ecstaticprince carry stylized engravings of flowers, and on each of the four sides ofthe base of the statue are carved mushroom motifs. These mushroom motifs alsoappear upon the subject so enraptured.Until these carvings came under the attentive gaze of Wasson, they had neverbeen botanically identified. Wasson realized that the stylized flowers were thekey to deciphering the true meaning of the Aztec statue and, moreover, the verymeaning of “flowers” in classic Aztec literature. As soon as Wasson intimatedthe statue’s full raison d’Ãªtre, he immediately contacted noted ethnobotanistRichard Evans Schultes at Harvard’s Botanical Museum, who was the obvious man toconsult regarding a botanical analysis of the motifs.Schultes was subsequently confident enough to identify the carved “flowers” asNicotiana tabacum, the common tobacco plant considered sacred by almost allnative American cultures; Turbina corymbosa, a species of morning glory whosepsychoactive seeds are known to have been employed by Mesoamerican cultures; andHeimia salicifolia, also a psychoactive species. Wasson noted that these specieswere representative of the Aztecs’ most revered plants, hence there were nodepictions of less-esteemed plants such as those employed by the Aztecs to makemaize beer.Wasson believed that previous ignorance of the statue’s true nature reflectedthe aforementioned widespread failing of historians to acknowledge the importantrole that psilocybin mushrooms and other sacred flora played in Mesoamericanhistory. In The Wondrous Mushroom, Wasson writes: “Our statue of Xochipilliserves us as a touchstone, as a cultural Rosetta Stone, bypassing the friarsencumbered with their theological preconceptions, speaking to us directly withthe voice of the pre-Conquest Aztecs.”5 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts8]It appears then that the Spanish clergy were ultimately unsuccessful insilencing the claims made by their subdued and conquered subjects; messages instone speak far louder than words. Xochipilli provides rock-hard testimony forthe Aztecs’ sacred bond with the natural environment and its array of potentbotanical resources. What exactly the Aztecs experienced through psilocybinremains debatable, although we can be sure that their visions were vivid andconvincing enough for them to regard the mushroom as a link to divine realms ofbeing, no less than the manifestation of God’s Flesh on the Earth.Wasson also went on to study pre-Conquest Aztec poetry written in the nativeNahuatl language. When this poetry first became accessible to the West, it hadbeen noted that “flowers” were referred to often. Peculiarly often in fact.Moreover, the oft-mentioned “flowers” were seldom, if ever, distinguished fromone another. Like the statue of Xochipilli, Wasson realized that the “flowers”referred to visionary agents, most notably the psilocybin mushroom.For instance, the poetry speaks of “the flowers that inebriate,” “the joyousflowers,” “the flowers without roots,” “the precious flowers,” and so on.Careful study shows that Nahuatl poetry is teeming with embellished referencesto “flowers.” This only makes sense if we accept that the Aztecs worshipped themushroom and other psychedelic agents because of their transcendentalpsychological effects and set their praises to poetry. As in the sculpting ofthe “Prince of Flowers,” the Aztec poets who wrote of “flowers” were producingtheir art from direct experience, their works channeling their deific respect.As a final testimony to the Aztecs’ use of psilocybin, mushroom motifs are alsofound in pre-Conquest codices (these codices are the pictorial records of theAztecs themselves and not those made by Spanish historians), in particularwithin the pages of the Vienna Codex, a historical document rich in pictographicinformation, including a section on ancient myths, aptly named the “Origin ofThings.” One page of this codex depicts the famous Mesoamerican god Quetzalcoatlbeing tutored in the use of mushrooms. There is no ambiguity in thedepictions—an entire page clearly portrays ritual mushroom use.Psychedelic TemplesPrior to the Aztecs’ rise to dominance and before the time of the Toltecs’reign, the religious core of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica was the prosperous cityof Teotihuacán, located in the Valley of Mexico, near modern-day Mexico City.The city dates from 150 B.C. to 750 A.D., but little is known about theTeotihuacáns, although Aztec legends equate this location with the birthplace oftheir deities. Its very name was given by the Aztecs who had discovered it sixhundred years after its mysterious collapse and means “Place of the Gods” inNahuatl.Due to the immense scale of Teotihuacán’s religious architecture, which includesthe spectacular Pyramids of the Sun and Moon and highly sophisticated wallpaintings rife with ornate serpent motifs, it can be reasonably assumed that itwas the center of an important religious cult. The overt presence of serpentmotifs on the architecture is a strong indication of religious worship, sincethe pantheon of almost all Mesoamerican cultures includes mythical serpentineentities, such as the feathered serpent god Quetzalcoatl. Elaborately stylizedserpents were used both to represent gods and to symbolize divine powerpenetrating the mundane world. Their fearsome presence on and around templessignified that the temple was a sacred place to be guarded from profaneintrusion.Of most concern here are the style and content of the numerous mural paintingsthat adorn most of Teotihuacán’s temples and shrines. In these murals we oncemore find depictions of various flowers, one of which is the morning glory(either Turbina corymbosa or Ipomoea violacea). As stated, the seeds of thisplant species contain LSD-related compounds known to have been used by theAztecs for religious communion. It is therefore reasonable to assume that thetemplegoers at Teotihuacáan knew of, and thus utilized, the psychedelic effectof the morning glory.Whether mushrooms are depicted in the temple murals is a somewhat contentiousissue. While Wasson affirmed this and pointed out what he considered to bemushroom symbols, these same motifs have been identified by other Mesoamericanscholars as representing the water lily. Although various related Africanspecies of water lily are thought to be psychoactive, it has not been firmlyestablished whether the New World variety are equally as potent. Either way,Wasson conjectured that the various temples of Teotihuacan, decorated as theyare with depictions of psychedelic plants (the morning glory at least), weresacred sites where the ritual ingestion of entheogens took place.Secret Psychedelic LegaciesThe concept that indigenous visionary agents have been ritually consumed byancient cultures in order to induce theophany and religious solidarity shouldcome as no surprise. In ancient Greece the classic Eleusinian Mystery cultechoes the inferred scenario occurring at Teotihuacán. Mystery rites took placeeach year at Eleusis, near Athens, centered on the drinking of some secretpotion that granted a transcendental vision to initiates. The entire sacredceremony was held within the guarded confines of a hallowed temple. Recenttheories have proposed that this Eleusinian drink was made from barley exposedto ergot. This would mean that it contained entheogenic substances becauseergot, a tiny plant fungus that grows on wheat and barley, contains a number ofLSD-related compounds. Although this psychedelic scenario has not been confirmedand remains merely an engaging hypothesis (ergot is also potentially toxic), thepoint is that the potion was almost certain to have contained some form ofpsychedelic alkaloid with the capacity to engender the type of mysticalexperience attested to in Greek historical literature. Wasson assumed thatTeotihuacán was a Mesoamerican equivalent to Eleusis, that is, that both weresacred places where visionary agents were ritually administered.Clearly the morning glory plant was utilized for its psychoactive effect by theTeotihuacáns (assuming of course that they did not just like the look of it), asthe various murals testify, and it follows that psilocybin mushrooms would alsohave been ingested had their properties been known at the time.The Birth of the Religious ImpulseClaims that infer that psychoactive plants and fungi played a major role inancient religion might be considered to belittle religion in some way, as thoughone were reducing everything to “damnable drugs.” Nothing is further from thetruth. Far from reducing the religion, the religion becomes firmly entwined withthe unequivocal numinous effects of vision-inducing fungi and plant species.That is the strength and force of such environmental resources. Visionary plantsand fungi cannot fail to have a dramatic impact. Anyone like Wasson who has madethe sacred connection within his psyche through the action of natural entheogensknows of their profoundly spiritual impact.Ultimately one comes to suspect, like Wasson, that the very historical source ofhumankind’s religious impulse lies in our ancestors’ primeval encounters withraw entheogenic species like the psilocybin mushroom, which are effectivewithout the need for elaborate preparation. This scenario does not lessenreligion; it empowers it, giving it an unstoppable impetus created through theeffect of visionary alkaloids in opening up the boundless capacities of thehuman mind. God becomes connected to a state of consciousness, an inwardly feltpresence mysteriously welling up from the depths of the psyche and not from someabstract dogma. However, religious dogma might well allude to the experience andindeed testify to the reality of entheogen-induced theophany. Yet once adetailed knowledge of the plant or fungus in question is lost in the hazy mistsof time, then any lingering memory of its original entheogenic power will be nomore than words, an echo of a once-living mystery.The greatest reason to embrace an entheogen-based explanation for the rise ofthe religious impulse, however, is that it is couched in wholly naturalisticterms, therefore lending itself to scientific study. If a man claims to have hada life-changing theophany, then that is one thing. But if he bears in his handthe very method whereby he attained such an experience, then you are obliged, ifyou wish to determine the man’s claims, to explore and verify the means. In moreways than one, psychedelic plants and fungi must be taken seriously in terms oftheir role in the development of religious ideology. As intimated, theirhistorical influence can never be overestimated.Mushrooms and the MayaPsilocybin mushroom use has also been associated with the Maya, whosespectacular Mesoamerican civilization dates back almost four thousand years andwhose Classic period held sway from A.D. 250 to 900. At the turn of the lastcentury, Guatemalan “mushroom stones” came to the attention of archaeologists.These Mayan relics, of which hundreds have been found, some dating as far backas 1000 B.C., were initially considered to be phallic representations, thoughthe current consensus is that the mushroom stones reflect a Mayan religiousmushroom cult.To bolster support for this theory, it has been noted that some of the stonemushrooms are carved emerging from human figures with trancelike facialexpressions. Others are linked to kneeling female figures at a metate, a kind ofwork surface upon which plant items are crushed. When Wasson first exploredmushroom use in Huautla in the 1950s, metates were still sometimes used to grindmushrooms so that an entheogenic infusion could be made. Still other mushroomstones exhibit “toad” effigies at their base, and this creature has always beenmysteriously linked with psychoactive fungi the world over, perhaps because ofknowledge that certain toads exude psychoactive alkaloids from their parotidglands. (Incidentally, this odd “toady” fact might account for the fairy storyThe Frog Prince, as magical events happen after a frog has been “kissed.”)Is there any other evidence that the Maya employed psilocybin mushrooms in theirreligion? A look at Mayan codices might shed light on this matter, yet ournot-so-delightful conquering Spanish priests made that almost impossible withtheir blundering haste to burn everything that stood in their theological way,including virtually all Mayan scriptures. As an example of this hooliganism,consider the fact that in 1562, one Diego de Landa, a hardened Spanish priest ofsome frightening zeal, seized thousands of Mayan “idols” and books, and burnedall and sundry as though they were worthless. Among the treasures destroyed weretwenty-seven roles and signs of hieroglyphics, invaluable sources of knowledgeabout the Mayan civilization. According to Robert J. Sharer in The Ancient Maya,Landa commented: “We found a large number of books in these characters and, asthey contained nothing in which there were not to be seen superstition and liesof the devil, we burned them all, which they regretted to an amazing degree, andwhich caused them much affliction.”6 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts9]Such a foolish and insensitive act has left the world with only a handful ofMayan codices with which to assess Mayan customs and beliefs. Within two ofthese remaining works, the Popul Vuh and the Annals of Cakchiquels, arereferences to psychoactive fungi, but there is no indication of the extent oftheir role within Mayan belief systems. In the so-called Books of Chilam Balamthere is mention of trancelike states, though no mention of entheogenic plants.Again, in many Mayan relief carvings, which seem to possess a psychedelic airabout them, are found scenes depicting visionary ecstasy, although plants arenot explicitly shown. Some scholars have therefore rejected the notion that theMaya employed natural psychedelic agents in their religious rituals (despite theexistence of the many mushroom stones) and have opted instead for thealternative view that the Maya, unlike the martial psilocybin-using Aztecs whowere to follow, were of a radically different nature and temperament. However,recently discovered Mayan mural paintings have depicted fearsome-looking battlescenes, so it is not absolutely certain that these two cultures were entirelydifferent.If we look more closely at the actual similarity in religious belief between theMaya and Aztecs, a common historical thread connecting the two cultures can bediscerned. Both peoples divided the cosmos into upper worlds and lower worldswith their respective gods. Both believed in the cyclical destruction andregeneration of the Earth, and both followed a ritual 260-day calendar. Bearingin mind these cultural similarities, it has been reasonably suggested that theMaya also utilized the mushroom as well as other psychedelic agents and thatthis practice influenced the nature of ancient Mesoamerican cosmology (it iseven feasible that the Aztecs adopted psilocybin mushroom use from the Maya—byway of a succession of mushroom-using cultures).It has also recently come to light, as many Mayan vases and pieces of potteryattest, that the classical Mayan elite used enemas. The objects that depictscenes of enema use date from the first millennium A.D. The daunting practice ofadministering enemas has been well documented in South American native peoples.In particular, it has been established that the Incas introduced psychoactiveinfusions into the body via enema, using bulbed syringes made from local rubbersap. Apparently, the use of an enema to introduce drug compounds into the bodyis almost as effective with regard to speed of action as is the method ofintravenous injection. Its effectiveness with entheogens occurs because thecolon is the receptive site of the enema and this is where absorption by thebloodstream occurs. A number of scholars have therefore claimed that entheogenicbrews were involved in these Mayan enema rites, and thus psilocybin might wellhave been employed in this manner.We should also be aware that much Mayan artwork is given over to portrayals of“vision serpents” manifesting themselves before entranced members of the Mayannobility. As I stated earlier, to the Mayan psyche, serpents represented theentry of divine forces into normal reality, and to depict fantasticallydecorated serpents hovering above an enraptured individual signified a communionwith the gods. Such individuals are often shown holding a special receptacle.This object is believed to either hold blood from a bloodletting rite or anentheogenic brew, both alternatives offering an effective avenue for attaining adesired visionary state of consciousness (blood loss can apparently lead to analtered state of consciousness—although I am not convinced it would be anenhanced altered state).Taking into account all of this data, particularly the hundreds of elaboratelycarved mushroom stones so far uncovered, many historians are compelled to acceptthat the Maya utilized entheogenic flora including psilocybin mushrooms, andthat the visionary realms made accessible by these plants and fungi influencedthe development of the Mayan cosmological and religious outlook on reality.Some Colombian Treasures Also Ring a BellPsilocybin mushroom use has also been inferred in pre-Hispanic Colombia due tothe discovery of hundreds of beautiful gold objects belonging to the Sinúculture, dated to approximately A.D. 1200. These are decorative anthropomorphicworks of art that characteristically carry two bell-shaped forms atop the headand were originally referred to by historians as “telephone-bell gods” (theshapes in question look like the bells found on old-fashioned telephones). Someof these bell-shaped forms are tipped with a small peak, while others aresoldered onto the main body of the anthropomorphic figure by a thin “stem.”Harvard’s ethnobotanical expert Richard Evans Schultes has suggested that thebell shapes are representations of psilocybin mushrooms, which would seemreasonable since several species of psilocybin mushroom are known to flourish inColombia, some of which possess thin stems and caps topped with a small peakedtip, or umbo.It is also worth noting that these mushroom objects are often adorned with toadeffigies, as is the case with many Mayan mushroom stones. Schultes sees this asfurther evidence that these objects were made in veneration of entheogenicagents, because, as you will recall, certain toads, including South Americanspecies, secrete psychoactive substances from their parotid glands. The evidenceis strong then that the historical use of psilocybin fungi and other entheogensextended well beyond Mexico and Guatemala, and that wherever they were employedthey were deified and incorporated into works of art.image [../Images/9781594779374_003.jpg]Viewed in the historical light of the Aztec and the Mayan empires, and to alesser extent in pre-Hispanic Colombian culture, the psilocybin mushroom emergesas the conductor of a sacred legacy. These once-powerful native peoples knew itsworth as an entheogen, a naturally occurring device for communicating with thespiritual domain. This is the botanical Holy Grail that Wasson had long questedfor and eventually found half-buried in a remote Mexican village. An unlikelyGrail knight, Wasson nonetheless recovered the power of the psilocybin mushroomfrom more than four hundred years of subjugation and presented it to the modernworld. Once unleashed, the psilocybin mushroom helped initiate a tremendouscultural change, only to fade once more into a period of obscurity. Before itsdeparture, however, psilocybin had managed to inch its way into the very heartof the West’s academic establishment, where it left a profound impact upon allwho encountered it. We now return to the wake set by Wasson’s fortuitousdiscovery."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/9781594779374_002.jpg]T H R E EPsilocybin Flows in and out of the Western MindWasson’s Life story sits like a glowing spiritual ember in the tinder-drysecularity of America’s 1950s culture. The United States, caught up in aburgeoning but banal materialistic dream, could not fail to be ignited by such asoul-stirring otherworldly tale. A few years earlier Aldous Huxley had writtenThe Doors of Perception, which detailed the entheogenic effects of mescaline.Both accounts were seminal in terms of their slow-fuse cultural impact. Eachcaptured the psychedelic zeitgeist that was about to erupt upon the world stage,and Wasson and Huxley emerged as the founders of a cultural movement that wouldeventually blossom into the “psychedelic sixties,” with its colorful burst ofartistic creativity and mind expansion.However, psilocybin, although initially sparking the psychedelic fire, soon leftthe scene of the divine crime, once more to fade underground into its mysteriousplace of origin. By the mid-1960s, its synthetic rival, d-lysergic aciddiethylamide, also known as LSD and acid, a substance whose structure andpsychoactivity are distinct from psilocybin, had taken over as the prime mover,demonstrating the popular appeal of laboratory-produced pills and tabs.Easily manufactured, packaged, sold, and swallowed, pills are what the publiccame to expect, and even demand, in a technological consumer age, and thereforemass-produced LSD was quick to fill the ever-growing market for psychedelics.More significant, the synthesis of substances like LSD allowed the power ofproduction to lie in our hands and not the Earth’s. In this way, the natural and“earthy” shamanic aspect of entheogenic species was lost. Which is to say thatthe potential of entheogenic plants and fungi to forge an informativerelationship between our species and Nature was not fully realized. Thus fromour discerning vantage point this side of the third millennium, we can look backto the dreams and quixotic idealism of the 1960s and understand that without aholistic appreciation of the biosphere and without an insight into thetraditional historical usage of psychedelics, a realistic new world vision inwhich our species reconnects with the bigger picture was unlikely to take a firmcultural hold.What this boils down to is the concept of naturalness and the intimation thatNature is more informative than we may imagine. In particular, I would arguethat the realization that entheogenic plants and fungi are part of the Earth’secology inevitably affects the significance and import of the entheogenicexperience. This means that the concept of naturalness acts as an importantcontext for the entheogenic experience, should that experience derive from anatural plant or fungus.It was precisely this natural biospherical/environmental context that was sorelylacking in the early wave of popular interest in psychedelics. Withoutacknowledging the botanical environment as the original supply line for theentheogenic agents that started the psychedelic sixties rolling, the acid gurus,despite their vocal enthusiasm for a positive psychedelic world revolution, werestill stuck with themselves, caught in a sort of anthropocentric loop, andthereby isolated from an intimate union with the rest of the biosphere. As Iwill show, the biospherical connection to the entheogenic experience representsthe newest phase of psychedelic history, an interesting turn of events full ofprofound implications for our species.Unsurprisingly then, although the psychedelic pioneers of the early 1960s wereoriginally turned on by the psilocybin experience—most notably the members ofHarvard University’s psychology faculty—they soon became completely embroiled inLSD and the media, and never really picked up on the grounded shamanic pulse ofthe mushroom. Perhaps this is why Wasson remained highly aloof of the wholehippie counterculture. He quietly pursued his academic research into ancientmushroom use, while other researchers, like Richard Evans Schultes, continued tometiculously document visionary plant use among fast-dwindling native peoples.Indeed, the diligent work of both these scholars has provided us with aninvaluable legacy of academic material on native psychedelic shamanism.Bugged by the CIABefore recounting Harvard’s brief scientific flirtation with psilocybin, Ishould like to alert the reader to a rather sinister twist to the events thatled up to the isolation and naming of psilocybin in 1958. In particular, one ofWasson’s trips to Mexico unfortunately carried a countercurrent to psilocybin’sholy mystique. Just when you thought it was safe to proclaim a spiritualrenaissance of sorts, who should arrive on the scene but the CIA. Thesedisturbing mischief-makers, who so profane history with their presence, willseemingly do anything to maintain a grim state of affairs in which the dour “wewas miserable in our day” archetype is nourished.In his book The Search for the “Manchurian Candidate,” John Marks tells us ofthe CIA’s covert involvement with our hero Wasson. In its relentless andarguably psychotic search for ever-more effective weaponry, the CIA had, by the1950s, initiated a massive twenty-five-million-dollar, long-term program calledMKULTRA. True to its suspicious-sounding name, Project MKULTRA involved findingchemical and biological materials for use in “mind kontrol” and otherpsychological unpleasantries. Despite the morally questionable nature of such anunsavory federal project, its dogmatic pursuit meant that it was soon to pick upon rumors of sacred Mexican mushrooms.After learning of Wasson’s 1955 experiences with the mushroom, an unscrupulouschemist named James Moore immediately began to work undercover for theconspirational agency. Presumably dollars changed hands surreptitiously. At anyrate, in 1956 Moore craftily wrote to Wasson informing him that he knew of afoundation willing to finance another Mexican trip in order that he and Wassonbring back some of the legendary mushrooms. Moore innocently claimed that, as achemist, he simply wanted to study the chemical structure of the mushroom’sactive constituents. The foundation was the CIA-backed Geschwickter Fund forMedical Research, and they were offering a two-thousand-dollar grant. WouldWasson be interested?Understandably Wasson took the bait, and so it came to pass that the CIA’ssecret quest for the sacred mushroom became Subproject 58 of the MKULTRAprogram, possibly representing the most crass approach to psilocybin to date. Itwas as if the CIA were lobbing stones at angels.Fittingly, it transpired that the double-dealing Moore was well out of hiscomfort zone in Mexico and loathed the entire episode. Wasson later recalledthat Moore had absolutely no empathy for what was going on. Whereas Wasson wassensitive to the customs of the native Mexican Indians and respectful of theircultural beliefs about the mushroom, Moore was there merely as a CIA pawn.Once again, all those who were in Wasson’s party took part in a mushroomceremony hosted by the shaman Maria Sabina, though it was Moore alone who had abad experience. Despite this, Moore was still able to bring back some of thefungi to the United States in the hope of isolating the active ingredient.Thankfully, however, he was beaten in his pharmaceutical pursuit by Roger Heim,an eminent French mycologist and coworker of Wasson, who managed to grow asupply of the mushroom from spore prints that he had taken in Mexico. Heim senthis newly cultivated samples to Albert Hofmann of Sandoz Laboratories inSwitzerland, and it was Hofmann, a highly distinguished chemist who hadoriginally synthesized LSD, who, in 1958, first isolated and then named theentheogenic alkaloid within the mushroom. Psilocybin was thus officially born, aname devoid of the weaponry connotations the CIA would invariably have conferredon the substance had they successfully isolated it first.Having failed in his allotted task, Moore was not terminated but later applieddirectly to Sandoz for a supply of psilocybin, as the CIA still maintained theirclumsy interest in using this compound as an agent for mind control. Indeed, theCIA soon began to covertly test psilocybin on unsuspecting American prisoners,probably not the best of subjects when it comes to being in possession of astable, healthy psyche. As the prisoners reported some rather bizarreexperiences, it became clear that psilocybin could not enter the CIA’sarsenal—it was just too darn unpredictable. Thankfully, the CIA then turnedtheir belligerent attentions elsewhere.The Psychedelic Infiltration of HarvardAfter Hofmann began to synthesize psilocybin from extracts of the mushroom, thedoor was open for properly conducted scientific investigation to commence. Apartfrom the rather dismal CIA attempt, it was 1960 that marked the beginning of thebrief affair between the scientist and the mushroom. This occurred at no less aplace than the psychology department of Harvard University, that bastion ofacademic respectability.What happens when professional psychologists come up against the phenomenalpower of psilocybin? One of two things generally results. Either they experiencethe substance personally and divine its profound implications for humanity interms of knowledge acquisition, psychotherapy, self-knowledge, and personalgrowth, or they refuse to take it and instead interpret psychotomimetic(literally psychosis-mimicking) symptoms in those who do take it. A rather sharpdivision therefore occurs, as it did at Harvard. On the one side stood theinfamous and lanky figure of Dr. Timothy Leary, heading a scholarly band ofpsychedelic intronauts, while on the other side stood members of the unimpressed“establishment,” who tolerated systematic experimentation for only a few years.If one pinpoints Leary as the man of the moment at the start of that turbulentdecade, able to seize the media and galvanize the American youth into rebellion,then we can zoom in on the actual experience that launched his prolificpsychedelic career. It was, of course, a mushroom experience.Dr. Leary Gets Turned OnFor forty-year-old Leary it began, as ever, in Mexico. Already an establishedand respected psychologist at Harvard, Leary spent the summer of 1960 with somefriends at the Mexican resort town of Cuernavaca. During his stay, ananthropologist associate at the University of Mexico, who had come acrossreferences to sacred mushrooms while studying the Aztecs, suggested that Learytry some.At noon one Saturday Leary gulped down six obnoxious-tasting local Mexicanmushrooms, which had been obtained with much more ease than those consumed byWasson five years earlier. Through this strange lunch, Leary’s fate waseffectively sealed. As he later wrote in his autobiography, while the psilocybincoursed its way through his “virgin” Irish bloodstream, he enjoyed the mostawe-inspiring religious experience of his life.Leary was convinced that in just four hours under the influence of psilocybin hehad learned more about the mind and the brain than in the fifteen years thathe’d been a professional psychologist. This gives good measure to the strengthand psychological impact of his first psilocybinetic encounter. Under the rightconditions the mushroom is able to restructure one’s culturally determinedconcepts about reality and proffer an entirely different set of beliefs withwhich to navigate oneself through life.Being a keen and responsive practitioner of psychological science, alert to newfields of discovery, Leary immediately requested funds to set up a researchprogram into psilocybin. In no time at all the Harvard Psilocybin Project wasinitiated, commencing at the end of 1960, when a handy batch of psilocybinarrived from Sandoz. Already the natural mushroom had been replaced with jars ofprecisely dosed pills, thereby subtly altering the context of the psilocybinexperience. How different might the implications of psilocybin have been atHarvard had the scientists had to go out into the wilds to pick their researchmaterial by hand . . .One of the most impressive projects undertaken was the systematic study of 175subjects given psilocybin in which the experimental emphasis was on providing arelaxed and supportive setting. This important notion of set and setting—thesubject’s mental and physical environment prior to taking the psilocybin—cannever be stressed enough, as they are crucial factors in determining thesubsequent psychedelic experience. Leary and his coworkers had alreadyestablished these facts among themselves prior to their officialexperimentation, and they were at pains to point out how set and setting playeda key role in whether the psilocybin experience proved well or ill. It ispossible that had someone without Leary’s temperament and intimate knowledge ofpsilocybin organized the experiments instead, then more negative experienceswould have been reported.As it was, most of the subjects reported a pleasant or ecstatic experience, thatthe psilocybin experience had changed their lives for the better. Nopsychological casualties were reported even though stronger doses had been usedthan in previous experimentation. There was no evidence for psychological orphysical addiction, although 90% wished to repeat the experience. No hangoverswere reported and presumably no one awoke the morning after to rooms strewn withempty bottles and cans. In a six-month follow-up study, none of the subjects haddeveloped enduring psychotic or neurotic symptoms. The experiment was a successin demonstrating that under favorable conditions, ordinary people were able tohave an inwardly enriching experience with psilocybin. Things on the psychedelicfront were looking good. The Earth’s special mushroom, albeit in pill form, wasshowing promise.These findings were eclipsed however by the legendary Good Friday Experiment of1962, surely one of the most radical and far-reaching psychological studies everundertaken. In their general approach to research and the collection of data,psychologists, particularly up until the 1950s and 1960s, had always had arather special affinity for rats, more often than not placing them in speciallyconstructed boxes where behavioral phenomena like classical conditioning (youremember Pavlov’s dog salivating to the sound of a bell) could readily beobserved. Go into any academic psychology department and you will likely findand smell a rat or three, so beloved are these furry rodents by the ardentpsychologist. Rats are cheap, easily maintained, and behave in a remarkablyreliable way (like small machines) in their reactions to the manipulatingadvances of experimental psychologists. Explanations about human behavior canthen be extrapolated (so they say) from the results of these rattish experimentson the reasonable but limited assumption that all mammalian brains run onsimilar principles.Such ratomorphism, as the writer and philosopher Arthur Koestler cynicallytermed it, used to dominate psychological science, and topics like mind andconsciousness were banished from the scientific arena like some forbidden fruitunfit for empirical consumption, even though, of course, the science ofpsychology is itself mediated through the stuff of consciousness. Today thingsare fortunately beginning to change, and a kind of philosophical psychologicalapproach to mind and consciousness is emerging, a topic I will later explore inmuch detail.Back in 1962 the Good Friday Experiment was as far removed from rats as ispossible, stretching empirical science to its limits. It was the type ofexperiment that our controversial psilocybin demanded, and its results remainsignificant.A Divine Invasion Upsets the Status QuoA psychology student named Walter Pahnke, working for his doctorate, arrangedthe experiment with the help of Leary and other members of the HarvardPsilocybin Project. It was an attempt to capture the psilocybin-induced mysticalexperience in quantitative measures through questionnaires. Althoughquestionnaire studies fall foul of a number of methodological criticisms, it isthe only viable scientific approach to measuring the reported subjective effectsof drugs. It is not enough for someone to claim that psilocybin is a wonderfulsubstance that elicits transcendental feelings of awe. Rather, one must obtainobjective measures if one wants to bring entheogens under the analytical eye ofscience; if, that is, one is a scientist who believes science offers the bestapproach to psilocybin—a moot point to be sure. If you’ve tried the stuffyourself and you’ve traveled to those divine realms, then you are one who knows.Leary knew, as did the other members of the project, but though they had tastedsuperconsciousness, they were still caught in the unenviable position of tryingto document the psilocybin experience with the relatively cumbersome toolsprovided by the science of that era. Understandably perhaps, Leary was soon todon a kaftan, abandon academia, and hijack the media instead. Yet the GoodFriday Experiment, or “Miracle of Marsh Chapel” as it became known, still standsout as the classic psychology experiment of that pre-LSD period.Five rooms in the basement of Boston University chapel were reserved for Pahnkeand the psilocybin project team. Twenty subjects, all theology students andtherefore at home in the chapel building, took part in the study, which employeda double-blind methodological approach. This meant that half of them receivedpsilocybin while the other half received a mildly psychoactive placebo. No oneknew who got what, not even the experimenters, though it soon became clear whohad been given the mushroom pills.Leary later recalled that the ten psilocybin subjects began to act ratherunconventionally. Some began to wander around the chapel murmuring prayer. Onelay on the floor, some lounged on benches, while another began playing strangemusic on the chapel organ. The most intense effects, however, were occurring inthe depths of the subjects’ psyches, and an analysis of the subsequent 147-itempsychological questionnaires completed by the subjects soon revealed what hadtaken place.The questionnaires were designed to probe various aspects of the psilocybinexperience. Parts of the subjects’ reports were then rated by naive markers, whohad to compare this psilocybin phenomenology (phenomenology is the study ofdirect conscious experience) with mystical phenomenology taken from variousreligious scriptures, without knowing which was which.Incredibly, the results showed that the psilocybin group had mystical religiousexperiences indistinguishable from those reported in religious literature. Thiswas a decidedly controversial finding. A naturally occurring substance, althoughin pill form thanks to Sandoz, had been shown to be capable of generating afull-blown mystical experience within the religiously ripe minds of theologystudents. The implications were enormous, and, as we shall see, many a storm wasto brew over the validity of chemically induced theophany. Traditionallycherished beliefs about mystical enlightenment and the religious impulse werebeing threatened by, of all things, a drug, and this was guaranteed to causeuproar and dissent among those members of the priestly elite who serve to policecommunion with the divine.Despite the beginnings of heated controversy, Pahnke’s thesis on psilocybin wasuneasily approved, though he was not allowed to continue his line of work andhis requests for further government funds were denied. Something was obviouslyamiss. Psilocybin—this wild alchemical product of Nature—was becoming a threatto long-established power structures both in academia and in the realm oftraditional religious beliefs about divine communion. Psilocybin’s wild andebullient energy, dormant for so long, was once more on the loose, this timeflowing though the very heart of the Western establishment.In one sense, it was as if the Good Friday study could be viewed as the lastexperiment that the scientist keen on ascertaining the nature of consciousnessand reality needed to perform. The message seemed clear. Humanity couldtranscend its secular level of being and raise itself to a new order, anidealistic dream shared by many early Western psychedelic explorers. Psilocybincould be carefully used as a source of knowledge and wisdom, allowing peopleglimpses of a transcendental reality that is a mere perceptual step away.As it was, the lofty psychedelic dream shared by so many at the time never quitematerialized, although I would argue that this was mainly due to the lack of anexplanatory framework for the psilocybin experience, and not because theidealism of the dream was untenable. Indeed, at this early stage in psychedelicresearch, almost nothing was known of psilocybin’s mechanism of action, andapart from Jung’s notion of the collective unconscious, there were little in theway of speculative psychological theories able to capture the full import andimpact of the psilocybin experience in a nonreductive way. In a real sense,language let the scientists down, or at least the lack of descriptiveterminology and lack of conceptual sophistication meant that psychedelicphenomenology remained an abstruse anomaly. And anomalies, even if they mightcontain the essence of some new ways of understanding the nature of reality, aremore often than not deliberately buried out of sight, or at least theconceptually uncomfortable data are all too easily lost somewhere at the back ofthe scientific community’s filing cabinet. Such a fate did indeed meet thepsychedelic experience, and by the late 1960s almost all of the world’s knownpsychedelic substances had been deemed a dangerous social threat and werepromptly declared illegal. Scientific research into psychedelics was therebyhalted.However, this was not a big and final end to the matter, and today scientistsare once again gradually returning to experimentation with psilocybin—often witha view to elucidating psilocybin’s therapeutic potential. It is also the casethat psilocybin mushroom use by the public is now more widespread than ever,particularly in Europe. Indeed, various specialized spore samples and grow kitscan now be purchased in many countries—although it is still unclear how the lawwill react to this novel situation. Given recent scientific reports on therelatively benign nature of psilocybin (which I discuss in more detail at theend of this book), one hopes that good sense will prevail and that themushroom’s decidedly spiritual influence will continue to be integrated withinour Western culture.Update: Just How Good Was That Friday?As further evidence of psilocybin’s vivid effect upon those fortunate theologystudents, and so that I can build support for my enthusiastic contention thatthe psilocybin mushroom represents a kind of medicinal soul food with which toreconceive the nature of reality, I now recount a follow-up study of sixteen ofthe twenty original subjects of the Good Friday Experiment. This was undertakenby Rick Doblin, president of the Multidisciplinary Association for PsychedelicStudies (MAPS), in the late 1980s when, by this time, many of the subjects werepracticing ministers.Doblin administered the same questionnaire used in the original experiment andfound that there was still a significant difference between the two groups as tothe reported effects of the experience. After twenty-five years, the psilocybingroup’s characterization of their mystical experiences had actually strengthened(or matured). Also, whereas the control subjects who had received the placebocould barely remember the day in question, the psilocybin group still had clearmemories of that eventful day. For instance, Reverend K. B. remembered:It left me with a completely unquestioned certainty that there is an environmentbigger than the one I am conscious of. I have my own interpretation of what thatis, but it went from a theoretical proposition to an experiential one.1[../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts10]Reverend Y. M. recalled:I closed my eyes and the visuals were back . . . and it was as if I was in anocean of bands, streams of color, streaming past me. The colors were brilliantand I could swim down any one of those colors.2[../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts11]More from Reverend K. B., who is more specific:With my eyes closed I had an unusually vivid scene of the procession going by[from the Passion of Christ]. A scene quite apart from any imagining or anythingon my part . . . kind of like watching a movie or something, it was apart fromme but very vivid.3 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts12]And further:I’ve remained convinced that my ability to perceive things was artificiallychanged, but the perceptions I had were as real as anything else.4[../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts13]That this minister viewed psilocybin as an artificial catalyst is to beforgiven. Careful consideration reveals that psilocybin is a legitimate naturalproduct of Nature, an unusual piece of biospherical fabric to be sure but nomore artificial than the oxygen we breathe or the plants that we eat. Rarerperhaps, and not absolutely essential, yet certainly not artificial.The Reverend K. B.’s description of the visionary experience as a kind of movieissuing from somewhere outside of one’s sense of self is one of psilocybin’shallmark effects and could not be put more clearly. This is the overwhelmingimpression gained while in the visionary state that arises with eyes closed. Oneis confronted with a powerful communicatory flow of organized symbolicinformation that compels one to infer an intelligent presence of some kind asthe issuer of the information. Although after such a profound experience onemight question the grounds for inferring an “Other,” during the visionaryepisode itself one might well be utterly overwhelmed by a sense of intentionalcommunication, leaving no room for doubt.In a way, these animated superdreamscapes, charged as they are with strikingmetaphorical imagery, are akin to those vivid dreams we sometimes experienceduring sleep and that leave us momentarily in awe as we later recall them beforethey invariably fade away. However, during psilocybin-induced visions one isstill very much conscious—more conscious and attentive in fact than normal—sothat the visionary scenes are not forgotten, or at least their overall message,impact, and urgency are not forgotten.Remarking on the sense of eternity that often accompanies the effects ofpsilocybin, Reverend S. J. remembers:All of a sudden I felt sort of drawn out into infinity. . . . I felt that I wascaught up in the vastness of Creation. . . . I did experience that . . . classickind of blending. . . . The main thing about it was a sense of timelessness.5[../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts14]Again, these quite simple reminiscences show that psilocybin carriesepistemological value, as it seems to elicit a special kind of knowledge notordinarily available but that is of immeasurable value to us in terms of spiritand soul. Even the most dogged skeptic must concede that, at the very least,psilocybin taps deep realms of the unconscious or imagination, revealing ahitherto unknown and unrealized creative potential.My claim is that a form of “higher intelligence” and wisdom is indeed accessedthrough the mushroom. Whether this “higher intelligence” stems from someunconscious psychological realm, that is, that deep within the psyche lie vastfields of highly organized information that are “released” into personalconsciousness during the entheogenic state, or that one actually gets tocommunicate with a sentient presence—the transcendental Other as we can callit—is open to question, although both suggestions may be linked in some way.For the time being, whatever we suspect underlies the visionary state, we cansee that the psilocybin experience is a compelling area of study, sinceconsciousness and perceived reality, the very ground of our lives, have thepotential to exfoliate like some new, exotic flower. Our everyday awareness isseen to be constrained and bounded, as if we were, for most of the time,subroutine prisoners in some vast, Matrix-like computation that surges everonward. Psilocybin temporarily dissolves these constraints, conferring on theexperiencer an increased cognitive freedom, facilitating new directions ofthought that are not normally available. The inner world becomes subject topictographic myth, while the outer world reveals itself as the living structureof some divine being, even the most mundane objects suddenly acquiring a holyaura. This is the latent promise of the mushroom: to reveal psychological realmsthat can enrich our collective existence as living, breathing hominid creaturesknitted together within the Earth’s evolving biosphere. Natural entheogenicagents like the psilocybin mushroom enable a particular type of knowledge tocome to an individual, a type of knowledge that science and philosophy canbarely approach, but which nonetheless bears heavily on our innermost nature.The Good Friday Experiment took science as close as it is likely to get tomysticism, apart from analyzing the actual brain during the mystical state. Yeteven that high-tech approach would dodge the main issue, which is the experienceitself and what it tells us about consciousness and reality. One has a choiceregarding strategies. One can try to map the brain to the nth degree in thelaboratory or one can simply plunge into a direct confrontational experience.The mushroomic Miracle of Marsh Chapel indicates the latter endeavor as beingthe most attractive, rewarding, and adventurous option befitting the humanspirit. At least to start with . . .Objectivity forces me to disclose a mild downside to the aforementioned study.Doblin’s long-term follow-up showed that most of the psilocybin subjectsreported some negative aspects to their experiences that were somewhatdownplayed at the time of the original experiment. In other words, their innerworlds were not constantly flooded by divine light but rather there was amixture of positive and negative aspects to the experience. Actually,psychological unease of one kind or another is somewhat inevitable if oneengages with the mushroom. One sees oneself clearly without the superficialtrappings of a contrived image and personality. The mushroom somehow amplifiesthe subconscious and the unconscious, forcing one to confront bad habits andneuroses. One is also made aware of any problematic relationships with friends,family, and associates. Nothing remains hidden to the mushroom, and this willoften lead to a psychological “shake-up” to persons hitherto blind toself-knowledge. After all, the tenet “know thyself” is bound up in some way withall spiritual disciplines, suggesting that one must come fully to terms withoneself before one can begin to inwardly develop one’s state of consciousness.Psilocybin and other entheogens would seem to highlight this timeless truth tosuch an extent that further psychedelic experimentation will prove to be ofnegative value unless one has dealt adequately with one’s state ofself-knowledge. The more balanced and healthily resolved one’s inner world, themore rewarding will the mushroom experience be.Another negative and unpublicized fact about Pahnke’s original experiment wasthat one of the psilocybin subjects had to have a shot of chlorpromazine (anantipsychosis drug) to combat some unwelcome symptoms. It seems that the studenttook the words to a sermon about the Christian need to spread the word rathertoo literally, a struggle ensuing as he tried to leave the chapel. I would pointout that such impractical messianic zeal can be countered by administering someself-control rather than chlorpromazine, though we must bear in mind that thesetheology students were essentially naive to psilocybin’s psychological effects.The more prepared one is to receive psilocybin in terms of an awareness of itsscope of effect, the more likely will the ensuing experience be wholly positiveand trouble free.Despite the unearthed downsides, at the end of his follow-up study, Doblinconcluded that: “All psilocybin subjects participating in the long-termfollow-up, but none of the controls, still considered their original experienceto have had genuinely mystical elements and to have made a uniquely valuablecontribution to their spiritual lives.”6 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts15]And there you have it, straight from the mouths of practicing ministers.Psilocybin doth work, and it doth work well. Human consciousness is positivelymutable and reality is up for reinterpretation. Amen.Leary Begins to Spread the Good NewsDuring the early days of the psilocybin project, Leary actually got to meetWasson. Although both had received the sacred mushroom vision and had come tovalue the experience as highly significant, their attitudes toward its use wereglaringly opposed. According to Leary, Wasson tried to come across as theauthority on mushrooms, more interested in his own experiences than those ofLeary and his associates. Wasson was also vehemently against the current trendof widespread psilocybin use, informing Leary that disclosing the secret of themushroom to the modern world had destroyed its power. Indeed, he would laterwrite of his abject remorse at publicizing the Mexican sacred mushroomceremonies.Leary, however, was soon to prove Wasson wrong on the potency of the mushroom.Psilocybin cannot fail to empower those who explore its magical effects, and,having taken it over fifty times within the first year of the Harvard project,Leary was by this time a much-inspired man on the verge of attempting worldrevolution.With his constant supply of mushroom pills, the heavily armed Leary soon beganextending his influence to various contemporary American poets, writers, andartists, in particular, luminaries like Jack Kerouac, Neal Cassady, AllenGinsberg, William S. Burroughs, and Dizzy Gillespie, to name but a few. Learybegan to realize that while many were enthralled by the experience, others wereovertly disinterested. Youth emerged as a salient factor in attitudes towardpsilocybin, and this led Leary to propose that the older that people were, themore fear they would have toward the visionary experience.I would surmise that this fear was the same fear that led the Spanish friars todenounce the Aztecs’ mushroom use as devil worship. Such fear also led to thefervent witch-burning policies undertaken by medieval inquisitors. Once a personhas a rigidly established psychological model of reality, then any tearingasunder of that model, any kind of incompatible data that threaten itsexistence, produces a negative and often violent reaction. An open-mindedapproach to psilocybin is therefore essential if it is to have a beneficialeffect. One must tread slowly and carefully and familiarize oneself with the newterritory since pitfalls lie in wait of the unwary and hasty explorer. Theexperience must then be somehow integrated into life in a way that minimizessocial disharmony.The year 1962 saw the ominous arrival of LSD at Harvard, and the entire culturalpsychedelic momentum was to change. Leary was so struck by this new syntheticalternative to psilocybin that LSD fast became the focus of attention, and themushroom faded almost into obscurity. Leary claimed that LSD was superior ineffect to psilocybin, and his high priest standing at this time meant thatothers were only too keen to follow his recommendations. Conversely, the lateTerence McKenna argued that natural psilocybin is a far more visionary substanceand ranked its worth above synthetic LSD (McKenna also popularized the termOther to refer to the intelligible presence accessed through psilocybin).McKenna held a more contemporary organic view that linked the mushroom with thenatural homeostatic systems of the biosphere. As mentioned, in the 1960s therewere little in the way of holistic theories about the biosphere, andethnobotanical investigations of plant-using shamans had yet to gather muchpublicity.At the same time that LSD flooded Harvard, opposition to psychedelicexperimentation began in earnest, partly due to the omnipresent influence of theCIA, which still wanted a monopoly on psychedelic drugs, and partly because ofthe alarming growth in popular experimentation with LSD, which was still legaland fast becoming available everywhere. In 1963 Leary was forced to resign fromHarvard, and so he duly took his LSD interests out into the big experimentalarena of mainstream culture, where he found himself to be quite adept in therole of psychedelic revolutionary. It is unfortunate that his clarion call,“Turn on, tune in, drop out,” was only two-thirds commendable. Drop out? Thiskind of negative turn of phrase could only serve to condemn Leary. (Why not“learn” or “listen carefully”?) Still, the pop psychedelic insurgency instigatedby Leary ensured that the “swinging” 1960s got under way, and despite the massdrop-out by the youth populous, the resulting counterculture was to spawn awealth of innervating art, literature, and music.Leary’s anarchic adventures went on to include the formation of the League forSpiritual Discovery (yes, that’s LSD), major court cases, his brief role as themost dangerous man in America, incarceration, a dramatic jailbreak, and hiskidnapping by the Black Panthers in the early 1970s. Interested readers can readof Leary’s enthralling escapades elsewhere, in particular, within the pages ofhis autobiography, Flashbacks, or in a lively book by Jay Stevens calledStorming Heaven: LSD and the American Dream.Unbeknown to virtually anyone at this time, mushrooms containing psilocybin wereto be found growing throughout Europe and North America, and not just in Mexico.The Earth itself, a far more efficient and ubiquitous supplier of entheogensthan the lab technicians at Sandoz, was secretly churning out millions ofpsilocybin mushrooms across its biospherical surface, an extraordinary fact thatdid not reach public attention until the late 1960s and early 1970s (since thenit has been speculated that prehistoric Europeans knew about psilocybin and thatits use influenced the dreamy spiral icons carved on rocks in places likeIreland. Interested readers should consult Paul Devereux’s book The Long Tripfor more information on this incipient subject).Attempts to Dam the Flow of PsilocybinAt this point in our journey I should like to examine the main objections thatwere often leveled against the use of psilocybin when it first became availablein the wake of Wasson’s discovery. Such objections were expressed precisely andclearly by various writers and social commentators, most notably the writer andphilosopher Arthur Koestler, whom I briefly mentioned earlier. Koestler, who hadwritten numerous acclaimed books on science, philosophy, and the paranormal,tried psilocybin on at least two occasions at the start of the 1960s. Leary, afan of Koestler’s work, had written to him about psilocybin’s miraculousproperties and had invited him to come out to Harvard to try it for himself.As it happened, Koestler’s first encounter with psilocybin occurred at thepsychology department of the University of Michigan, which, unfortunately, wasanother hotbed for covert CIA experimentation and therefore not the best ofplaces in which to start one’s entheogenic journeying. His second taste occurredat Leary’s apartment, as Leary had originally intended. Both encountersconvinced Koestler that psilocybin was basically worthless, an opiniondramatically at odds with Leary and most others who had tried it.On March 12, 1961, the British newspaper the Sunday Telegraph published apolemic article by Koestler in which he denounced the psilocybin experience.Entitled “Return Trip to Nirvana,” this account described Koestler’s personalpsychedelic experiences and concluded in no uncertain terms that psilocybin hadnothing whatsoever to offer humanity. He wrote: “Chemically inducedhallucinations, delusions and raptures may be frightening or wonderfullygratifying; in either case they are in the nature of confidence tricks played onone’s own nervous system.”7 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts16]He offered even harsher words about his second trip at Leary’s apartment. Whenan American writer and acquaintance talked of “cosmic awareness,” “expandingconsciousness,” and “Zen Enlightenment,” Koestler thought this “downrightobscene, more so than four-lettered words.”8[../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts17] Clearly, here was a man a trifle irritatedby the blossoming psychedelic culture. Koestler was no hip hippie.Koestler went on to argue that psilocybin gave rise to “pressurecookermysticism” and no more. Discussing Huxley’s pro-psychedelic observation thatmany mystics and religious visionaries employed various physiology-changingtechniques like breathing exercises and fasting to facilitate altered states ofawareness, Koestler countered with a parable about mountain climbing, claimingthat the view obtained when one has slogged for hours on foot up the mountain isfar superior to the view obtained at the end of a cable-car journey. In otherwords, the laborious toil undertaken by the fasting, self-flagellating,cave-dwelling ascetic leads to a qualitatively different revelation than thearmchair mystic who merely pops down a handful of Sandoz pills.This is the classic philosophical objection laid against the potentialtranscendental effects of substances like psilocybin. It is too easy. Where isthe relentless sweat and toil? Where are the physical scars of the tortuousjourney that preceded the mystical illumination? How can one possibly haveaccess to realms of spiritual ecstasy without undergoing years of suffering? Arewe to admit that any Tom, Dick, or Leary can achieve transcendence withoutexperiencing untold pain, misery, and self-mortification?Koestler, at least, was convinced that there were no shortcuts to the divine,and he stated this clearly to Leary and in the newspaper article. Significantly,he admitted to Leary that he was in the wrong state of mind when he triedpsilocybin at Leary’s apartment, that he had been awoken to painful memories ofbeing a political prisoner during the war. Similarly, on the night before hisfirst unpleasant brush with the drug, he’d had disturbing dreams that lingeredon long enough to pervade the psychedelic state. In fact, Leary himself hadsecond thoughts in inviting Koestler to try psilocybin, as he came across asbeing too controlled and rational. Although these considerations go a long wayin explaining Koestler’s negative encounters, the criticisms he raised stillstand strong, and the advocate for the continued investigation of psilocybinmust perforce respond to the allegations.I can offer two lines of defence to parry Koestler’s objections. First, it isalmost certain that Koestler did not dwell upon the fact that psilocybin is anatural part of the environment and not an unnatural synthetic product. Had heactually gone out and picked psilocybin mushrooms for himself perhaps hisexperiences might have been more rewarding, because the actual act of mushroomcollection leaves an indelible earthly mark upon the memory. This fact ofpsilocybin’s naturalness, which I consistently remark on, deserves a still moredetailed examination, and this is a good opportunity to begin doing so. I willreturn to answering Koestler’s criticisms after this brief diversion.Food for ThoughtAs we shall see in much more detail later, psilocybin is believed to cause itseffects by acting upon nerve cells, or neurons, within the brain. In particular,it acts on those neurons that utilize a substance called serotonin. Serotonin isa chemical messenger, or neurotransmitter, that allows individual neurons tocommunicate with one another to transmit and process information. Now, thevarious compounds employed by brains to process information have evolved overmillions of years, and they are determined by the chemicals available in theenvironment, in particular, from the raw materials available in food. Serotoninhas emerged as a key neurotransmitter, or chemical messenger, because it can beproduced relatively simply from raw materials. You cannot just have any oldchemical compound acting as a neurotransmitter; it has to have arisen throughevolution under the deterministic constraints set by the laws of chemistry andthe further constraints set by the availability of food.Hence, serotonin is bound up with the chemistry of the environment. If thechemical constituency of the natural environment was radically different, Naturewould have been forced to evolve completely different neurotransmitters thatreflect to the constraints set by that environment. In this sense, we are indeedwhat we eat, and the notion that consensus reality is a popular serotonergichallucination yields a formidably uncanny wisdom. Our minds, our veryconsciousnesses, depend upon the hardware of the brain, which in turn depends onchemical structure, which further depends on diet. Natural psilocybin mushroomscan enter one’s diet, and the new chemicals subsequently operating within thebrain will alter awareness so that our common hardwired “serotonergic reality”shifts, as it were, to a rare “mushroomwired psilocybinetic reality.”Having said this much it should now be absolutely clear that the psilocybinmushroom experience is wholly natural, and that it arises out of anenvironmentally driven alteration in brain chemistry in as much as thepsilocybin mushroom is part of the environment. There is nothing artificialabout this process at all. Just as we can selectively pick wheat to make breadfor our physical well-being, so too can we selectively pick and consume naturalpsilocybin mushrooms for our spiritual well-being. Both wheat and mushroom arelegitimate natural expressions of the interwoven biospherical system withinwhich we are embedded. I think it unlikely that Koestler considered theseenvironmental facts before making his negative judgments.The second line of defence against Koestler’s classic objections is that it isnot certain that technological short-cuts—as he called them—are necessarily bad.Is not the Earth viewed from space satellites beautiful? Viewed thus, is itreally any less beautiful than if we were to build a really large ladder andclamber up to get the same view? Should we abandon all labor-saving technologyand make things as hard as possible for humanity?I think not. Huxley’s vision in The Doors of Perception of a mass-marketedpsychedelic that enlightens the world cannot be faulted on its technologicalmethodology. If technology, pharmaceutical or otherwise, can hasten some form ofimproved psychological condition, then the only thing stopping this is a senseof distrust and guilt, arguably instilled more often than not by dogmaticreligion. Indeed, Leary surmised that Koestler’s mountaintop parable arose froma deep-seated Catholic guilt, a guilt that arises all too easily in the face ofpleasure, ecstasy, and the bounds of human freedom.Having defended the idea of humanity-saving technology, I would once more remindthe critical reader that psilocybin is not a technological product anyway (atleast not in the traditional sense). Koestler perceived it so because hispsilocybin came in the form of a Sandoz pill, the perfect symbol of a moderntechnological fix. This is in direct contrast to the overtly organic symbolismof the wild mushroom.When Koestler left Leary’s company to return to New York, it was wryly notedthat he did not walk back but got a plane. Leary concluded that to ignorepsilocybin as a psychological tool would be akin to rejecting the microscopebecause it made seeing too easy, a good analogy since both tools uncover thehidden riches of Nature.I think it safe to conclude that Koestler’s negative attitude stemmedprincipally from his painful store of POW memories and the unresolved conflictslying in the depths of his psyche. In particular, I would suggest, as did Leary,that Koestler’s Catholic guilt played a large part in his rejection of themushroom.This same type of traditional religious guilt, which seems to have plaguedhumans from time immemorial and which easily transforms into an oppressive driveagainst other people’s freedom, was also displayed, among others, by the Frenchpoet Baudelaire. Like other nineteenth-century poets and writers, such as Byron,Shelley, Balzac, De Quincey, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge (who reputedly wroteKubla Khan after an opium reverie), Baudelaire once used “trendy” psychoactiveplant products like opium and cannabis for creative purposes. Yet he later cameto utterly despise them, as if they were the root of all that is evil andmisleading, no less than the most cunning of the Devil’s tools for thwartinghumankind from reaching God.The point is missed, almost deliberately it seems. Psychoactive plant substancesare not inherently evil; rather they can become destructive if used in excess orfor the wrong reasons, much as any benign substance can become harmful if usedbeyond moderation. Had Koestler been in the possession of the right frame ofmind and received the ultimate gift of the psilocybin mushroom, that is, had heperceived a direct communion with the transcendental Other and realized thatthis was a wholly natural phenomenon, then perhaps he would have embracedpsilocybin’s cultural healing potential.It seems, then, that if the potentially spiritual effects of the mushroom arelikened to a stream, the stream can “hit” the wrong human mind, or at least thewrong state of mind, causing the stream to be blocked. Where it cannot flow onand blossom, psilocybin’s numinous potential will remain unrealized. God’s Fleshis clearly not for everyone. This fact must perforce be considered at lengthbefore any kind of nontrivial investigation commence.The Mushroom as MedicineIn his noted book The Ghost in the Machine, written in 1967, Koestler had awonderful opportunity to praise the virtues of entheogenic agents. Among otherthings, the book is concerned with humankind’s violent, paranoid, destructivestreak and how this evil can be overcome. After documenting the awful historicaleffects of our “schizophysiology,” as he terms it, Koestler argues that our onlyhope for survival is to develop techniques that supplant biological evolution.He reminds us of all the ways we have tampered with Nature—like birth control,disease prevention, and artificial environment creation—in order to simulate andcontrol the process of evolution for our own adaptive advantage. So, asksKoestler, can we not invent a remedy for the human tendency toward destruction?Unable to ignore Aldous Huxley’s popular advocacy of psychedelics as culturalhealing agents, Koestler opposes that kind of solution, claiming that it isfundamentally wrong and naive to expect drugs to confer free gifts upon themind. In other words, Koestler asserts that drugs cannot put into the mindsomething that is not already there. He argues that the “psycho-pharmacist”cannot add to the faculties of the brain, at best we can only eliminateobstructions that might impede the brain’s proper functioning.Koestler finally envisages a “mental stabilizer” or hormone that can integratethe psyche. He even goes as far as fearing that his readers will be disgusted bythe idea of relying upon salvation through molecular chemistry rather thanspiritual rebirth. This is an astonishing claim, even the more so since herefuses to advocate natural entheogenic substances as his “mental stabilizer.”Contrary to Koestler’s beliefs, Nature and the evolutionary process have not letthe human race down; rather, we have been blind to Nature’s subtle ecologicalsolutions. Nature works in mysterious ways, one of which is the production ofplants and fungi possessing vital shamanic power through which the web of life,which includes human culture, can continue to function healthily.Although it might sound somewhat archaic to seek curative help from plants andfungi in our modern era, we should keep in mind that shamanism is perhaps theoldest form of religious psychotherapy and that the knowledge gained byvisionary shamans was used precisely to help heal the tribe. There is no reasonto assume that such psychedelic shamanism is now impotent or irrelevant,especially if we consider the interconnectedness of the biosphere. In ecologicalterms, the shamanic ingestion of plants and fungi is an entirely natural processthat—when we take into account the ecological system of shaman, tribe, andplant—is essentially homeostatic in that one part of the environment acts uponanother to restore balance and health; in this case certain plants and fungiyield aid through their psychological effects and the higher knowledge that theyconvey. This “eco-psychotherapy,” as we may call it, highlights just how much weare connected to the rest of life’s web and how the solutions to our problemsare often to be found growing around us (including, of course, potentialbotanical cures for cancer and AIDS still to be discovered in what is left ofthe Earth’s great rain forests).Entheogenic species of plant and fungus still offer us a wealth ofpsychotherapeutic power if we choose to look their way, not to mention theinformation they reveal about the chemical mutability of human consciousness andthe possible transformation of our models of reality. Like most philosophers,Koestler seemed far removed from the natural botanical world, but with theadvent of ecological awareness movements and a renewed interest in all thingsGreen and environmentally friendly, our deep connection to the rest of Naturelooms ever more apparent and a Green cultural ethos is already establishingitself. By radical means, Nature itself may yet cure our destructive streak.Support for the Mushroom GrowsAnother well-known writer at the time of psilocybin’s first wave of Western usewas the revered author and poet Robert Graves, who also wrote publicly of hismushroom experience. Actually, Graves had been intrigued by mushrooms ever sincehe had licked a species of fly agaric as a young boy and had consequentlyexperienced burning sensations on his tongue. Perhaps the incident was asymbolic biospherical kiss of sorts, or at least a taste of things to come. Atany rate, as the reader will recall, it was Graves who originally notifiedWasson of the secret mushroom ceremonies still extant in Mexico. It comes as nosurprise then that Graves eventually went on to write speculative articles onentheogenic mushroom use in ancient Greece (his speculations remain contentious)after he tried the sacrament in Wasson’s New York apartment in 1960.Graves was, it transpires, understandably apprehensive about his first brushwith psilocybin, especially worried that he might perceive “demons” behind hisclosed eyes. Being the author of the acclaimed The White Goddess, a book about ahistorical cult of goddess worship, was no guarantee that Gaia’s mushroom wouldshower him with grace (Gaia was originally the name of the Greek Earth goddess).As it was, Graves need not have worried. Unable to write during his rapture, hepassively let the experience overwhelm him. Afterward he was to write that hehad seen a “mountain-top Eden” and experienced the “bliss of innocence” and “theknowledge of good and evil.”9 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts18] He had evenfelt capable of solving any problem in the world, as if he had access to all ofthe world’s knowledge.Graves went on to predict that a once-sacred substance entrusted to an elite fewwould soon be sought by “jaded sensation seekers,” although they would likely bedissatisfied with psilocybin, as it was not a “drug” as such because it failedto stupefy like alcohol. He ended his descriptive account with the followingwarning, which still rings true today:Good and evil alternate in most people’s hearts. Few are habitually at peacewith themselves; and whoever prepares to eat hallucinogenic mushrooms shouldtake as careful stock of his mental and moral well-being as initiates tookbefore attending the Eleusinian Mysteries. . . . This peculiar virtue ofpsilocybin, the power to enhance personal reality, turns “Know Thyself!” into apractical precept; and may commend it as the sacramental food of some newreligion.10 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts19]Fine and prescient words indeed, once more indicative that psilocybin should beapproached cautiously and with a “good heart.” Graves’s remark about “jadedsensation seekers” is almost identical to Wasson’s emerging dismay at the hoardsof “oddballs,” “thrill seekers,” and “riffraff ” who were already descending indroves upon Mexico in search of divine mushrooms. However, this type of popularreaction to a new phenomenon was surely inevitable. Although it was to causeabject consternation among the psilocybin elite, to deny the mushroom outrightto the masses is an impractical, short-sighted reaction to basic human nature. Iwould argue that knowledge of psilocybin’s spiritual power is best laid open toall who might wish to seek it out. If this be considered by some as castingpearls before swine, then so be it. The point is that the end will justify themeans, this end being, hopefully, a culture transformed with a revitalizedveneration for the natural systems of the Earth and a deeper insight into thetranscendental aspects of the reality process. The eco-destructive age in whichwe live surely demands a cure along these lines.Moksha-Medicine Grows on the Verge of ParadiseAldous Huxley explicitly summed up the early mood of optimism surroundingpsychedelics in a speech he delivered to psychologists in 1961, and somewhatmore implicitly in his Utopian novel Island, published in 1962. In the speechHuxley predicted that psychological science would inevitably be confronted withmore and more data on the visionary experience induced by substances likepsilocybin. Although these experiences might be valueless—no more significantthan a trip to the movies—it might be the case that if the visionary experiencewere cooperated with, if some deep meaning were ascertained and acted on, thenthis could be crucial in changing the lot of humanity. Huxley conjectured thatpsychedelics encouraged a state of mind in which reality is perceived in anon-utilitarian manner and that the visionary experience could lead to a changein behavior for the good. If so, this would reinforce the maxim of eminentpsychologist William James that a spiritual or mystical experience be judgedpragmatically through its consequences upon the life of the experiencer. If thepsychedelic visionary state can enrich one’s life, then, by definition, it isfor the good.In Island, which was Huxley’s final novel, his fictional Edenic islanders use“moksha-medicine,” an entheogenic mushroom, as part of their religious rites.Indeed, the mushroom supports the islanders’ paradise. This invented mushroomwas almost certainly based upon the psilocybin mushroom, as Huxley had triedpsilocybin on a number of occasions.The issues raised in his earlier work The Doors of Perception are discussed byhis islanders, in particular, whether the effects of moksha-medicine areillusory or real. Through one particular piece of fictional dialogue we areasked to consider the idea that perhaps the brain transmits consciousness ratherthan produces it. In other words, perhaps moksha-medicine allows a larger volumeof what Huxley refers to as Mind at Large (Mind with a big “M”) to enter one’sindividual mind (mind with a small “m”). Later, I will have much to say on thisdeceptively simple remark, as it bears heavily upon the whole notion of thestuff of consciousness.As the islanders who champion moksha-medicine assert, even the bottom lineplaces value on the experiences engendered by their mushroom, for if there is noobjective content at all in the experience, it is still life-enriching andprovides a “blessed transformation.”At one point in the story, the archetypal skeptic and disbelieving characterMurugan receives the following rejoinder.You’ve been told that we are just a set of self-indulgent dope-takers wallowingin illusion and false samadhis. Listen, Murugan—forget all the bad languagethat’s been pumped into you. Forget it at least to the point of making a singleexperiment. Take four hundred milligrams of moksha-medicine and find out foryourself what it does, what it can tell you about your own nature, about thisstrange world you’ve got to live in, learn in, suffer in, and finally die in.Yes, even you will have to die one day—maybe fifty years from now, maybetomorrow. Who knows? But it’s going to happen, and one’s a fool if one doesn’tprepare for it.11 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts20]Arguably the greatest, most eloquent, and most passionate spokesperson for theintelligent use of psychedelics during the 1950s and early 1960s, Aldous Huxleywas unaware that his beloved moksha-medicinal fungi were, even as he wroteIsland, spreading their mycelial networks throughout the wild unfarmed soil ofmost of the planet’s Temperate Zone, their presence stretching across vasttracts of unspoiled land. In the autumn months, this secret undergroundarrangement was yielding countless psilocybin mushrooms, and Huxley never livedto discover this most astonishing of truths. All but forgotten by the mid-1960s,the psilocybin mushroom would eventually rise and fruit again."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/9781594779374_002.jpg]F O U RInvestigating the Earth’s Alchemical SkinMexico and South America are the areas most associated with ritual entheogenicplant use. Apart from utilizing over twenty species of psilocybin mushroom,native Mexicans are also known to have employed the peyote cactus, the morningglory plant, and various species of datura, all of which contain potentvisionary substances. The appeal of these plants, like the appeal of themushroom, is that they support a channel of communication between the shaman andthe spiritual domain. As we have seen, this unusual state of affairs arises notfrom hearsay or dogma, but from the mind-expanding effect of these plants on thehuman psyche, an effect equally reported by Westerners who might not necessarilybe as spiritually inclined as native shamans.In South America, aboriginal Amazonians still prepare a highly innervatingpsychedelic concoction called ayahuasca, made principally from an indigenousspecies of Banisteriopsis jungle vine, along with various other plantingredients. This same potion is also taken as a sacramental tea by members ofthe UniÃ£o do Vegetal, an officially sanctioned church found throughout Brazil.The active principles in these potions are the substances harmine anddimethyltryptamine (DMT for short), the latter being a close structural relativeof psilocybin. Shamans claim that ayahuasca facilitates communion withmythological beings as well as the souls of their ancestors. Similarly, speciesof Virola tree—the resin of which also contains DMT—are used to prepareentheogenic snuffs in Amazonian Colombia, which are taken to free the soul sothat it may travel in the spiritual dimension.These rich shamanic traditions highlight the ultimate way in which the naturalenvironment can inspire an individual, as an intimate link is forged between thehuman psyche and the transcendental dimension of reality. Once such anemotionally charged shamanic connection has been so established and isreinforced through ritual use of a particular visionary plant, the process willgenerally cultivate an enduring sense of spirituality as well as a religiouscosmology, as is the case surrounding the use of ayahuasca.It is not surprising then that the profound psychedelic effect of theseindigenous plants becomes firmly integrated into native culture, the shamanicknowledge so acquired reaffirming the culture’s identity and the people’sbeliefs about the nature of reality. Furthermore, and perhaps of mostimportance, these plant species aid the practice of healing, whether mental,social, or purely physical. In native societies without a health service orsubjugation to pharmaceutical conglomerates, the curative role of the shamanbecomes an essential feature of daily life, with natural plant allies being verymuch a tool of the healing trade.This kind of spiritual relationship between Homo sapiens and Nature isrelatively rare, compared with, say, our close relational links to environmentalresources like wood, grain, oil, or gas, yet the natural entheogenic link leavesall others behind in terms of its impact on one’s sense of being. Whereas mostof the relational ties that weave us into the living fabric of the biosphere arepurely utilitarian in material terms, the resource provided by entheogenicplants operates at a different level, offering us spiritual nourishment, which,although seemingly intangible, can still have a cultural role to play, aswitnessed by the important role of the shaman or native healer within aboriginalsocieties.Of course, we might object here and assert that we have no need for shamans orentheogens in our technological culture, that we should leave these ostensiblymarginal phenomena to those academic anthropologists and ethnobotanists whosevocation it is to gather information on such matters. Indeed, over the pastthirty or so years a wealth of research articles have appeared that describe, inquite exacting botanical detail, how various entheogenic concoctions areprepared by the native cultures who still use them. However, it is almostunheard of for the witnessing ethnobotanists or anthropologists to actuallyexperience the visionary brew for themselves. All the surrounding paraphernaliaassociated with the alchemical preparation might well be attested to right up tothe actual implements employed to administer it, yet the principal substance ofinterest remains exempt from inquiry. This missing factor is what is actuallydriving the researchers’ interests, namely, the resulting psychological effectof the preparation. After all, if the eventual experience generated by thesacrament were not in any way notable, there would be no shamanic legacy tostudy.We can see then that although science might be commended for documenting whatis, after all, a fast-disappearing aspect of aboriginal culture, the mostimportant ingredient—the experience—is generally not witnessed. Perhaps this isbecause ethnobotanists feel there is no scientific banner under which one couldreasonably and legitimately go ahead and sample the entheogen in question. Butthere is. It’s called phenomenology—the study of immediate experience and itsimplications for the allied science of psychology. To actually personallypartake of shamanic substances is to glean an insight into the psychologicalforces that they set in motion. With an inside view, we might understand moreclearly the role of the entheogenic experience within the belief systems ofnative cultures. More to the point, we might gain valuable insights into themutable potential of consciousness, thereby allowing us to make intellectualground in otherwise intractable areas of human inquiry.The Blind Eye of ScienceThe inadequacy of science in the study of entheogens is doubtless bound with thecompartmentalization of science into separate disciplines. While it is rare fora scientist in any particular field to stray into another discipline, it can beargued that cross-boundary studies may be fruitful in initiating new insightsand broader theories. In the case of entheogenic compounds, if we wish toproperly understand the entire complex of the entheogenic experience—whether theexperience of a native shaman or the experience of a Western experimenter—then amarriage must perforce be made between psychology, phenomenology, anthropology,and ethnobotany (and even metaphysics) since the subject area can embrace allthese fields. If we bear in mind that disciplines like ethnobotany arerelatively new anyway, the new discipline that I am envisaging is a distinctpossibility. Waxing lyrical, I would call such an enterprise neo-shamanicphenomenology. At least it has an impressive ring to it.But perhaps we assume that we already know all there is to know about thepsychological modus operandi involved in the action of a classic entheogen likepsilocybin? Perhaps a complete and satisfactory explanation of the visionaryheights of the psilocybin experience has already been delivered by mainstreampsychological science, reduced to a handy set of merelys? Alas (or thankfully),this is not the case. Not only are substances like psilocybin relatively new tothe West, but also empirical psychological research was effectively curtailedfor decades. The Harvard Psilocybin Project merely scratched the surface of themushroom phenomenon, yet that in itself was enough to cause consternation to thescientific elite. Not to mince words, but psychedelic plants and fungiintimidate the scientific community, not just because of the multifariousdisciplines potentially involved but also because their effects are just toocontroversial to handle. Heads turn away. Cold shoulders are shrugged.Despite the dangers posed by the use of psychedelic substances—like theircapacity to induce intense psychological terror (the so-called “badtrip”)—native cultures have managed to “tame” them through a learnedappreciation of their scope of effect. Furthermore, these cultures have acquireda wealth of edifying knowledge along the way. Hence, it is my belief thatentheogenic flora and fungi have yet to make their full impact on the Westernpsyche. The knowledge to be gained from their use relating to our conceptions ofreality and our theories about consciousness will prove to be of great value notonly on an individual level but on the collective level also. These arereasonable claims since we undoubtedly base our value systems and mass culturalbehaviors on our tacit beliefs about the Earth, life, and our role in the wholecaboodle. The alluring possibility with the psilocybin experience is that afterinitiation one can come to view life in a radically different light. One learnswhat shamans have always known, that Nature is somehow imbued with intelligence,or at least the characteristics of intelligence. The biosphere, or Gaia,suddenly appears to be really alive, with visionary plants and fungi acting as akind of interface between the wisdom of Nature and the human mind. In this way,an experienced and receptive individual can access transcendental informationloaded with cultural and personal significance.Given their uplifting and profoundly informative properties, psilocybin fungican be viewed as a potentially symbiotic partner with our species. The symbiosisinvolves the new range of conception and perception galvanized into operationthrough the mushroom’s effects and, in return, our propagation of the species orat least action on our part that serves the biosphere’s overall interests insome way. In any case, psilocybin fungi, like other naturally occurringentheogens, are very much with us and here to stay. As far as we know, morepeople are familiar with the mushroom today than at any other time in history.Indeed, its use has continued to grow in popularity since the 1970s, when booksfirst appeared detailing the various species that could be located in Europe andNorth America.Notwithstanding the saturation of the entire globe in fungicides, restrictedaccess to wilderness areas, or other madcap responses to the presence ofpsilocybin fungi, we have a choice as to whether to investigate the Earth’salchemical skin further or to turn our backs for fear of the unknown. If we dodecide to pick up the “entheogenic gauntlet,” we might well be rewarded with acascade of novel insights into the deepest mysteries of being along with avastly improved relationship with the rest of Nature. Official science can playa role in this noble venture as can independent research at the behest of noauthority other than one’s own.An Inner Revolution AwaitsWith various species of psilocybin mushroom growing throughout most wild placesof the world (more than one hundred species are now known to flourish across theglobe), and bearing in mind their illuminating properties, with which more andmore people are becoming familiar, one suspects that some innervating culturalalchemy is at hand. As we shall see in more detail later, paradigms—conceptualbelief systems—crumble and are rebuilt in the wake of the psilocybin experience.This kind of paradigm shifting is not simply an event that transpires afteringestion of the mushroom; rather, the process can continue long after theoriginal experience, almost as if some process of long-term digestive refinementwas taking place. By this I mean that if we reflect on the experience in termsof how, say, the mushroom works chemically, then we gain exceptional knowledgeabout the underlying chemistry of the brain and the potential parameters ofconsciousness. And if we reflect on the self-knowledge that the mushroomaffords, our inner lives may duly be improved. The very real possibility ofperceptual enhancement is also at stake, potentially raising our dialogue withNature to new levels never imagined by conventional science and philosophy.It is through these new conceptual tools, or new improved lenses, to borrow froman earlier metaphor, that old paradigms will perforce be challenged. If theseold paradigms cannot deal with the psychedelic experience, then they must eitherbe adapted or be confined to the past. It is in this way that psilocybin and itseffects can become integrated into our culture.Psychedelic Science: Round TwoBy now, the reader might assume that mainstream science only skirts around theissues we are most concerned with, that the only extant psychedelic researchrevolves around ethnobotany. Indeed, with America’s illegalization of LSD in1966 and with the subsequent illegalization of almost all psychedelic drugs(Europe followed suit), human-based studies stopped dead. Everything on theexperimental front went into cold storage. You could almost hear the bolts andlocks sliding into place. Consciousness alteration had become a hostage topolitics.However, after all these years the locks have been surreptitiously picked andthe politics of consciousness challenged. To be sure, a new kind of psychedelicresearch is gradually becoming apparent. This time around the scientistsinvolved do not throw wild parties, nor do they exhort young people to “turn on,tune in, and drop out.” Dressed in traditional lab coats and sensible shoes, thesecond generation of psychedelic scientists have got their empirical acttogether. Human-based psychedelic science is now returning to the academic fold,only with far less publicity than fifty years ago and with a lot more cautionand circumspection. This time around, science is taking it step by careful step.Leading the resurgence are two American organizations: The MultidisciplinaryAssociation for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), which I briefly mentioned in thelast chapter, and the Heffter Research Institute (HRI). Founded in 1986, MAPSactively funds psychedelic research (as well as medical cannabis research) andhelps scientists draw up their research protocols, a tough job when you have toapproach notoriously conservative governmental agencies for permission to doyour study. The HRI is a slightly younger organization, inaugurated in 1993 andnamed after Arthur Heffter, who, at the end of the nineteenth century, becamethe first scientist to isolate and systematically study a psychedelic compoundfrom a plant—in this case mescaline from the peyote cactus. Of particularinterest is a 2006 psilocybin study by the Johns Hopkins University of Medicinethat was partly funded by the HRI. Researchers looked at the effects ofpsilocybin in healthy volunteers and found that when administered in comfortableand supportive conditions psilocybin potentiated life-affirming mysticalexperiences in the majority of the subjects. While this is nothing new, it is atleast refreshing. The study also made headlines in many magazines and Internetvideo reports.Apart from studying the effects of psychedelics upon healthy people, the mainthrust of both MAPS and the HRI is finding a therapeutic use for thesesubstances. This is a practical agenda that appears to be more acceptable to thevarious officiating bodies that control the availability of psychedelic agentsto science. In reality, I believe that both organizations are acutely aware ofthe role that entheogens can play in the study of consciousness in and ofitself. They are, perhaps wisely, less vocal about this “other” agenda. Despitewishes to the contrary, politics and science invariably mix, and this is themain reason why the therapeutic application of entheogens gets priority funding.Perhaps we are witness to paradigm shifting by stealth.One recent study of note involved giving psilocybin to patients suffering fromadvanced-stage cancer. This was done to ascertain if psilocybin could, somewhatironically perhaps, alleviate feelings of anxiety. Although the study wastentative and only involved a dozen terminal-cancer patients, the results wereencouraging and showed that, according to some scales, anxiety was indeedreduced. This suggests that psilocybin can allow one to come to terms withtroubling processes beyond one’s control, to let go as it were to that whichmust perforce be left behind, and thereby find some kind of peace andacceptance. I have seen a poignant video clip of Pam Sakuda, one of the subjectsinvolved in the study, and was deeply moved by her account of how the psilocybinexperience helped her deal with the terrible ordeal of having a terminalillness. I was even more moved when I did an Internet search about her andlearned she had died a few years after the study. It seemed that her psilocybinexperience enabled her to speak bravely about what she was going though at thetime.Similar tentative studies have been conducted in which psilocybin wasadministered to patients suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Allthose in the study showed decreases in their OCD symptoms while under theinfluence of psilocybin, with an improvement in their condition generallylasting more than 24 hours. As of 2011, psilocybin investigations are also underway under the auspices of the Beckley Foundation, a charitable trust based inOxford in the United Kingdom. They are currently setting up studies toinvestigate psilocybin’s role in memory recall, particularly the recall ofrepressed memories, which can be useful in psychotherapy, along with studiesthat will determine whether psilocybin can be used to successfully treataddiction to drugs like nicotine and alcohol. This latter study will proveinteresting. For if psilocybin can, through sheer spiritual force, help peoplekick their addiction to booze and tobacco, then millions of people will likelybe up for treatment and thus millions of spiritual experiences might be in themaking. Who knows? Maybe we will be witness to an alchemical plot of globalproportions in which various psychoactive substances are mingling, catalyzingone another’s production, and even vying for cultural supremacy.The Medical Use of IbogaineAnother psychedelic drug presently receiving much scientific scrutiny over itspossible medical utilization is ibogaine, an alkaloid derived from the WestAfrican plant Tabernanthe iboga. The plant is employed in situ by members of theBwiti cult, a religious society found in Gabon and the Congo, who use it in muchthe same way psilocybin mushrooms and ayahuasca are traditionally used. The aimis to free the soul to connect with God and the ancestors. Here is a typicalreport from a native African user: “I wanted to know God—to know things of thedead and the land beyond. . . . I walked or flew over a long, multicolored roador over many rivers which led me to my ancestors, who then took me to the greatgods.”1 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts21]Ironically, perhaps, scientists have now established that the psychologicaleffects of ibogaine can be used to break hard drug addiction. In the mid-1980s,Howard Lotsof, an ex-junkie cured through his experiences with ibogaine, formeda company to promote the medical use of ibogaine. So assured was he ofibogaine’s capacity to break drug addiction, that Lotsof patented ibogainetreatments in the mid-1980s. Apparently, it is the unusually intense andpersonally significant visionary effects of ibogaine that can break the curse ofhard drug addiction. Lotsof describes the visions induced by ibogaine inpatients he has treated as being like movie clips: “The presentation of visualmaterial is rapid. Some patients have described it as a movie run at high speed.Others describe it as a slide show, each slide containing a motion picture of aspecific event or circumstance in the viewer’s life.”2[../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts22]Once more, we see the capacity of entheogens to instigate dramatic visionaryexperiences within the human psyche. Lotsof refers to these movie-clip visionsas having Freudian and Jungian connotations, as if they could convey deep andsignificant meaning to the experiencer, and he infers that it is this processthat lies at the heart of ibogaine’s efficacy in breaking patterns of addiction.Lotsof believes that ibogaine is able to make patients reevaluate their livesand see the mistakes that they may have made and that may have led them intouncontrollable bouts of drug-taking. After treatment with a single dose ofibogaine, the majority of patients remain free from chemical dependence forthree to six months, which indicates that ibogaine therapy needs to be ongoingand, if possible, be accompanied by other treatments. Interestingly, a recentBBC television documentary named Tribe showed intrepid explorer Bruce Parrytaking part in a lengthy and sometimes harrowing Iboga religious ritual inGabon. Parry reported that the Iboga plant allowed him to view his life from theperspective of those to whom he had caused emotional pain. After the Iboga ritewas completed, Parry felt truly reborn.DimethyltryptamineA leading figure in the second wave of psychedelic research is Dr. RickStrassman, a psychiatrist who carried out some remarkable studies at theUniversity of New Mexico in the mid-1990s. A look at his groundbreaking researchreveals the spirit of a scientist determined to break through politicalbureaucracy in order to advance the frontiers of knowledge and add to thepharmaceutical armory of the practicing psychiatrist.Strassman’s work has centered on the prototypical entheogen dimethyltryptamine(DMT). Recall that DMT is a naturally occurring substance employed for millenniain the botanical potions and snuffs utilized by native Amazonian shamans.Classed as an ultra-short-acting hallucinogen, DMT, when administeredintravenously to humans (as opposed to the drinking of an ayahuasca brew),causes fantastic alterations in consciousness and yet is completely inactivewithin thirty minutes (the effects of ayahuasca can last for hours). If DMT issmoked, the experience is even shorter, sometimes lasting less than fiveminutes.Because DMT is believed, strangely enough, to occur naturally in the human brain(trace amounts have been found in blood, urine, and spinal fluid, and precursorenzymes for it have been found in brain tissue), it was apparent to Strassmanthat an understanding of its action might shed some light on the development andpossible treatment of endogenous hallucinatory conditions like schizophrenia. Itis in this way that clinical science comes to make antipsychotic drugs,substances that can block pathological forms of thought. Once you understand theneurochemical events that accompany abnormal states of mind, then you are in aposition to develop drugs to treat such conditions.Despite his purely clinical leanings, Strassman was also interested in using DMTto explore the ever-more-popular brain/mind issue. This murky area ofscience—which we shall be returning to in later chapters—is concerned with howthe physiochemical brain (the unsightly mass of gray jellylike stuff in ourskulls) is related to the nonphysical mind with all its attendant thoughts,ideas, fears, beliefs, and so on. What exactly is the connection? Strassmanargues that because psychedelic drugs alter consciousness, they should be ableto tell us something about how consciousness is formed in the normal brain. Inother words, since psychedelics alter higher cognitive functions connected withwhat it is to be a conscious human being, then they can essentially be employedas probes to study the mind/brain interface. This is, of course, exactly thepoint I outlined in the prologue of this book.It took Strassman two long years to secure permission to carry out DMT studieswith humans (experienced psychedelic users were utilized, as this was deemedmore ethical). Indeed, this magnitude of effort probably explains the currentlack of human-based hallucinogen research. A look at Strassman’s strugglereveals the horrendous bureaucratic forces (a kind of lingering cultural symptomof the 1960s) that face the potential psychedelic researcher. Strassman had toget permission from all sorts of official bodies, such as the formidable DrugEnforcement Agency (DEA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), not tomention the numerous ethical bodies that serve to monitor human-basedexperimentation.Two years of uphill struggle and Strassman finally acquired all the necessarypermission to perform a DMT study. The remarkable results were subsequentlypublished in reputable but specialized scientific journals, a bit like plantingthe seeds of a new paradigm underground. Perhaps the most interesting findingconcerned the subjects’ reports on what the (intravenously injected) DMTexperience was like. As with psilocybin, the effects of DMT warrant ourattention if we are interested in the latent potential of human consciousness totranscend “normal” reality. In Strassman’s own words:Several aspects of DMT’s effects are interesting. The rapidity of onset is quiteremarkable; nearly instantaneous when given intravenously. Also the shortduration is remarkable; people are quite over the inebriation within 20 to 25minutes. Many people describe an “intelligence” within the DMT state, which iseither just “felt” or “sensed” and sometimes actually “seen” with the mind’seye. People often lose insight into their participation in a drug study forseveral minutes, forgetting how they got into the mental state they findthemselves so suddenly thrust into.3 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts23]As with its close structural relative psilocybin (molecules of these twocompounds are only a few atoms different from one another), subjects reportedthat the DMT experience felt more real than normal reality. Indeed, it ispresumably this novel reality encountered through DMT, especially with regard tothe perceived contact with an “intelligent Other,” that has led to the use ofDMT-containing plants by Amazonian shamans. As already noted, shamansconsistently claim that their DMT-containing concoctions put them in directcontact with a transcendental dimension infused with intentionality. What makesthis even more intriguing is that Western DMT users report similar experiences.Consider this lucid report from author Daniel Pinchbeck, author of Breaking Openthe Head.I had the sense of floating through a fractal tapestry, a curving and unfoldingplane of synthetic, plastic, fantastic whiteness and gleaming colors in endlessvibrant hues. This extradimensional realm I had pitched into was made, I feltcertain, of data, of quantum equations, visible shamanic harmonics, and theself-weaving fabric of extradimensional superconsciousness. . . . There was, inthat place, rushing toward me, an overwhelming force of knowledge and sentience.I knew it was impossible that my mind, on any level, had created what I wasseeing. This was no mental projection. This was not a structure within the brainthat the drug had somehow tapped into. It was a non-human reality existing at adeeper level than the physical world.4 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts24]Clearly the chemistry of the brain is indubitably bound with consciousness. Bothare mutable. Moreover, certain realms of consciousness can be generated inwhich, as Pinchbeck forcibly attests, a seemingly autonomous intelligence isapprehended. If ever there was a “hard” approach to spirituality, this is it.Although the study of mystical experiences and neurochemistry might seem likecompelling science, the fact of the matter is that most scientists exercisegreat caution when it comes to explaining, in scientific terms, something asprecious and as guarded as the mystical experience. Those who tend to policecommunion with the divine, like religious leaders for instance, are quick toreact when scientists attempt to reduce an epiphany to neurochemical eventsoccurring in the brain. Indeed, recall the reaction to Walter Pahnke’s findingsin the 1960s at Harvard. Many religious authorities felt their toes beingstepped on, and Pahnke was refused further funding. Yet science, with itsinevitable expanding interest in the nature of human consciousness, is surelymature enough to take on the issue, and it thus remains to be seen what sciencecan teach us about the potentialities and extraordinary capacities of the humanbrain/mind.Again, I hasten to add that science is not the only valid approach to studyingaltered states of consciousness. As I have repeatedly implied, directself-experimentation according to one’s own terms and at one’s own risk is alsoan option. At the end of the day, data is needed. From data we can derivetheories. Because all entheogenic experiences carry data, we should not be in arush to dismiss any self-report, whether garnered from a native shaman, anofficial study subject, or an independent researcher.Does the Brain Recognize DMT?There was another finding by Strassman that proved provocative. Strassman foundthat the human brain does not develop tolerance to DMT. Whereas the brainnormally develops tolerance to psychoactive chemicals (repeated use means youneed to use more to get the same experience), Strassman found that tolerancedoes not develop to the repeated administration of DMT. This suggests that, inthe “normal” brain, DMT has some kind of function—that is, the brain recognizesDMT and repeatedly utilizes it instead of developing a tolerance to it. So farthis putative function of endogenous DMT remains unknown, but it might well beinvolved in the process of dreaming. This is a tenable hypothesis because wemust dream every night. If we are selectively denied that part of the sleepcycle in which we dream—known as REM sleep—we will subsequently have more dreamsat some later time (known as the REM-rebound effect). And so if there are indeeddream-inducing chemicals such as DMT, then the brain would by necessity have tomake sure that it does not develop tolerance to them because tolerance wouldstop dreams from taking hold. It is also the case that both dreams andDMT-induced visions are of a somewhat similar nature. Both represent dramaticpsychological scenarios that experiencers may find themselves unwittinglyinvolved in.Strassman also recognized a new clinical use for DMT. He was able to administerDMT every half hour to his subjects, and after each session he was able todiscuss their experiences. He found that the subjects’ “psychologicalresistances” gradually wore down through these sessions, suggesting that DMT hastherapeutic potential. Indeed, as DMT is only active for thirty minutes, it hasan advantage over therapeutic drugs whose effects last much longer and thatrequire more in the way of supervision from the therapist.So What Does It All Mean?Although the therapeutic application of entheogens seems apparent, it’s lessclear how these substances work and how we might address the variousimplications of their uncanny effects. At the very least, psychedelics alterconsciousness in a dramatic fashion, and at the most extreme, as we haverepeatedly seen, such substances can elicit a transcendental experience in whichone apparently communes with an intelligence of some kind. Unsurprisingly, thereis a popular belief among many of today’s psychedelic researchers that the veryorigin of humankind’s religious impulse is bound with our ancestors’ discoveryof entheogenic fungi, a notion that, as you may recall, was first introduced byR. Gordon Wasson. Professor David Nichols, president of the Heffter ResearchInstitute, puts it this way:One can imagine an early hominid accidentally ingesting a psychedelic mushroomwhile foraging for edible foodstuffs. Knowledge of these drugs was handed downthrough the generations and led to the creation of rituals around their use. Wehave the hymns written to Soma in the Rig Veda, or the ancient EleusinianMysteries of Greece, as only two examples of the extreme importance attached tothese substances. . . . Whatever you believe in this regard, it is a simple factthat the use of psychedelic drugs can profoundly alter one’s understanding andbelief about life and its meaning. Man has been on an age-old quest to find hisplace in the Universe, and these drugs can be important tools both inunderstanding this quest, and in gaining meaning about ourselves as consciouscreatures.5 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts25]Whether or not these speculations about mushrooms are correct is not the mainissue. The main issue is the conceptual paradigm that sees a naturally occurringpsychedelic agent of some kind lying at the heart of humanity’s sacredtraditions. As it is, there is certainly some intriguing evidence that humancivilization has been using psychedelic mushrooms since the earliest times.Dating from before 6000 B.C. (a long, long time before the Mexican use ofpsilocybin mushrooms described in chapter 2), rock paintings found at Tassili inNorthern Algeria show mythical shamanlike beings covered in mushrooms. TheseNeolithic mushroom motifs are very distinct. Some have therefore argued that theGoddess-worshipping peoples who inhabited Tassili consumed locally gatheredpsilocybin mushrooms (such as the large species Stropharia cubensis) and thatthis practice influenced their spiritual beliefs. Whether the inferred mushroomuse at Tassili was novel or derived from an even more ancient tradition is anopen question yet to be resolved.While the debate on the prehistoric relevance of psilocybin and its effectscontinues, we can end this chapter with a comment by Dr. Strassman. The commentconcerns the value of researching the entheogenic experience to aid ourunderstanding of human consciousness. With regard to the mystical claims made bynative peoples who employ entheogens, Strassman says:Scientists ought to take all claims about the mind seriously. The DMT andpsilocybin states . . . are basically non-material. They are not dependent uponthe body moving through space, or interaction with other material objects. Thus,they are windows into consciousness, which, while it may have structuralunderpinnings, is essentially a movement of energy, rather than of matter. . . .So, at the very least, any claims by non-Western people about consciousnessmight prove very valuable . . . for speculation about how the mind works. Inaddition, these “non-literate” cultures are how we found out about DMT andpsilocybin in the first place.6 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts26]"},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/9781594779374_002.jpg]F I V EThe Mushroom and the SynapseNow that I have acquainted the reader with the distinctly mystical nature of thepsilocybin experience, it is time for us to focus our attention on psilocybin’sphysical modus operandi. If we can come to grips with how alkaloids likepsilocybin work their spectacular effects within the brain and mind, then wewill be one step closer to a preliminary understanding of the nature ofconsciousness and the underlying factors governing the switch from normalawareness to the mystical perception of an intelligent Other.At this point, consciousness lies smack-dab at the center of our inquiry. Allour paths of investigation lead directly to it. The psilocybin cultural historycovered in the first few chapters of this book arose solely because of theradical change in consciousness induced by the mushroom in the Mayan and Aztecpsyche. The pre-LSD investigations at Harvard were likewise galvanized intoaction by psilocybin-induced states of consciousness. Indeed, the whole 1960sthing happened, in part, precisely because of the new ranges of consciousexperience originally kick-started into existence by the mushroom. The growingsecond wave of psychedelic research has likewise appeared on account of thecompelling nature of entheogenic states of consciousness. One cannot escape themystery of consciousness. Psilocybin simply highlights the boundless nature andmystical potential of the human mind lest we allow this fortunate state ofaffairs to pass us by.As I pointed out at the very outset of this book, if we are interested inapprehending the ultimate nature of the reality process, it makes sense to focuson consciousness because consciousness represents the interface that links us tothe “world out there.” If we can understand what consciousness is, we might alsounderstand how consciousness is able to be transformed and whether such atransformation can yield bona fide insights into the subtle nature of Nature.Nothing less than reality is up for grabs.In the chapters that follow, I hope to develop a new, nontechnical, anduser-friendly theoretical framework that can explain both normal consciousnessand entheogenic consciousness. Essentially this conceptual framework derivesfrom Aldous Huxley’s reasonable assertion that the psychedelic experienceresults from an influx of information not normally available to us—hence the“doors of perception” being opened after ingestion of substances like, inHuxley’s case, mescaline. What I eventually hope to show is that consciousnessis actually a form of information; that physical matter can be described interms of information also; and that reality ultimately consists of a flow ofself-organizing information, with human consciousness occupying a significantfunctional role in the entire process. However, before we can explore theexciting ramifications that an informational model of reality yields, we muststart from the beginning, that is, we must look more closely at the obviouslyimportant physical relationship between psilocybin and the human brain.Neuromancing with NeuroscienceIn any serious attempt to elucidate the brain processes underlying thepsychological effects of entheogenic agents, one must utilize whatever relevantscientific data is at hand. In our case this means neuropsychological data, ofwhich much has become available since the 1950s era, when Huxley wrote The Doorsof Perception.Neuropsychology is a modern scientific discipline based on the study of thenervous system, which consists of the body’s entire network of nerve cells.These nerve cells, or neurons as they are more formally known, allow us tosense, transmit, and process information. Whereas other cells in the body aredesigned to form tissues and organs, neurons exist solely to transmitinformation in the form of discrete signals, or impulses. We are able to see,touch, smell, hear, taste, feel, and think because we possess a vast network ofthese neurons, which manage to continually process and communicate informationabout both the external state of the world and the internal state of the body.Of particular interest to neuropsychologists is the detailed study of the brain(one component of the nervous system) and the way the brain’s particular neuronsfunction to produce thinking and behavior. Because psychoactive substances areknown to influence the way brain neurons process information, neuropsychologyhas made some headway into understanding the chemistry of the brain and theactual way in which psychoactive substances work. Thus, we now know somethingabout how common psychoactive substances like coffee, nicotine, and alcoholinteract with the brain’s neuronal architecture to cause their desiredpsychological effects of stimulation or stupor.However, the study of psychoactive substances is far from beingneuropsychology’s key research area. Of perhaps most prominence is the study ofthe effects of brain trauma, a condition in which parts of the brain aredamaged. A brief look at the rationale governing this kind of research revealsthat we can approach the phenomenon of the entheogenic experience in much thesame theoretical way.For instance, medical patients with brain tumors and a correspondingpsychological deficiency are, despite their misfortune, of great interest toneuropsychologists because a causal relationship can be ascertained between thearea of the tumor and the particular psychological disturbance. This is equallytrue of brain-damaged victims of accidents, for where there is localized braindamage one invariably finds psychological disturbances of a definite kind thatare associated with that area of the brain.As an example, damage to the part of the brain known as Broca’s area often leadsto language problems associated with speech production. Patients of this typehave no difficulty in understanding speech but have noticeable difficulty inproducing speech, even to the point of being mute. The point of interest is thata specific area of the physical brain is damaged with an associated specificpsychological disruption. Once the neuropsychologist has gathered a wealth ofsuch examples, then psychological functions like language (which is oftendisrupted after brain injury) can be divided into various subsystems or“modules” operating in different areas of the brain, each of which can bedifferentially affected.The upshot of this methodological enterprise is that scientists are now able tospeculate about normal brain function and to link localized physical brainmechanisms with aspects of the mind. This is quite an achievement, resultingdirectly from the prevailing localization paradigm governing a major part ofneuropsychology. It is therefore not unusual to come across references to themapping of the human brain whereby different areas are associated with differentpsychological functions.Bearing this in mind, it is clear that we could examine the entheogenicexperience in a similar way. That is, by looking at the specific changes toconsciousness arising from the presence of specific substances in the brain, weshould be able to theorize about how normal consciousness arises. In otherwords, just as we can analyze abnormal language production and then speculateabout how the language system works in normal people, so too can we analyzealtered states of consciousness and speculate about the nature of normalconsciousness. At any rate, by examining chemical changes associated withchanges in consciousness, we ought definitely to come to some understandingabout the nature of mind stuff and the ways it is possible to modify mind stuffthrough chemistry. On the face of it at least, this area of study promises awealth of relevant psychological data with which to understand the elusivenature of mind.Despite this reasoning, scientists, as should be clear by now, haveunfortunately been hindered from investigating the psychedelic experience, andit is only in the last few decades that they have been permitted to resumestudies in this fascinating domain. And yet enough information on thepsychedelic experience has been generated with which to construct auser-friendly theory of consciousness. Most of this information I have outlinedin previous chapters, in particular, information on the fundamental type ofglobal change in consciousness caused by psilocybin. If we add relevantinformation regarding the physical details of psilocybin, we shall be able toreach some sort of sound theoretical conclusion about the nature ofconsciousness. Regardless of any legal issues, this mode of inquiry promises tobe most fruitful. In fact it is rather apt that a mysterious phenomenon likeconsciousness should require such radical means with which to pry open itsnature.Introducing the Neuronal BrainAs mentioned, the brain consists of individual information-processing nervecells, or neurons. It is estimated that the human brain contains up to onehundred billion of them. This is an astronomical number pretty much impossibleto conceive. Regardless, these billions of neurons are the essential “wetware”of the brain, and massed together with other cells that provide support andenergy, they form the spongy gray matter residing within our skulls. We shouldalso consider that each of these billions of neurons forms interconnections withthousands or even tens of thousands of other neurons. We will learn more aboutthis a bit later on.Although the evidence is overwhelming, it still seems extraordinary that thisconvoluted blob of porridge-like neuronal stuff within our skulls is bound upwith the elaborate properties of the human mind. Although one might havereservations in associating a spongy, wet blob with consciousness, theassociation is indisputable. Scramble someone’s brain either through a severeblow to the head or through some other trauma, and that person’s consciousnesssimilarly becomes scrambled. Or, electrically excite the brain of a patientundergoing brain surgery who is under the effects of only a local anesthetic,and the electrical stimulation evokes definite and often vivid lifelikeexperiences. And, of course, certain chemical substances introduced into thebrain serve to alter consciousness.Hence, it is overwhelmingly apparent that the human mind with all its attendantbeliefs, ideas, neuroses, fears, hopes, dreams, goals, and aspirations isintimately bound with the unsightly wet-blob brain inside our crania. Indeed,what distinguishes Homo sapiens from, say, our primate cousins, is the sheersize of our brains and the mental abilities that a relatively big brain grantsus, abilities like self-awareness, language, complex social behavior, foresight,problem solving, metaphysical musing, and so on. We are what we are by virtue ofour evolved brains, the phenomenon of human consciousness being determined bythis fortunate evolutionary turn of events.So what is the neuron exactly and how does it come to be involved not only inyour reading of these words, but in the psilocybin experience? What is itexactly that these billions of units do?Naturally Neat NeuronsStructurally, the neuron has four main components: dendrites; the soma (norelation to Wasson’s Soma!), or cell body; the axon; and terminal fibers. Thismay sound somewhat complicated, but the basic principles involved are easilyunderstandable and are essential knowledge to anyone interested in how the braindoes its thing.Imagine a big tree suspended in midair. The bottom of this tree has a densenetwork of roots, which are attached to a bulbous lower trunk. Above this fatlower trunk is a long, thin upper trunk that ends with a wispy network ofbranches. In this picturesque analogy of the neuron (which will be worth bearingin mind for the discussions to come when we try to imagine psilocybin’s journeywithin the brain), the roots of the tree are the dendrites, the bulbous lowertrunk is the soma, the long upper trunk is the axon, and the topmost branchesare the terminal fibers. This is the essential structure of an archetypal neuronwith its four distinct components, and all of the brain’s neurons are basicallymade in this way. Neurons are akin to microscopic protoplasmic trees.The dendrites are the root structures of the neuron, which serve to receiveinformation in the form of signals, or impulses, from other neurons. In ouranalogy, the root network of the suspended tree receives signals from thebranches of other trees suspended below it. These neuronal signals travel to thesoma (lower trunk), where they are integrated. The singular result of thisintegration is then passed on to the axon (upper trunk), which in turn passes onthe information to the terminal fibers (branches).Already we can see that neurons transmit informational impulses in an orderlyand well-defined manner; that is, informational signals progress or flow throughthe neuronal architecture in one direction only. But what exactly are thesesignals? Because neurons are living tissue, they operate by making use of theirinherent electrochemical property, which is to say that their particularchemical molecular structure allows electrical potentials to be generated. Theneuron has been constructed by Nature in such a way that it can either fire ornot fire, depending on its input from other neurons. Firing here means that theneuron sends forth an electrochemical impulse (a rapidly traveling wave ofelectrical excitation) down its axon to its terminal fibers, at which point theimpulse can be transmitted to other neurons.This then is the way that neurons process information. The information theycarry is embodied in the electrochemical activity of the neuron—its state ofeither firing or not firing, transmitting electrochemical impulses on to otherneurons or not transmitting impulses. This all or nothing behavior is ratherlike the “bit” components inside computers, which store information by beingeither on or off, active or inactive. Neurons thus appear to operate in a kindof all or nothing digital fashion. Neurons can either fire or not fire; theycannot half fire. There is no room for doubt or indecision, only a logicallydetermined discrete firing or nonfiring signal according to what other neuronsin their vicinity are doing.The purpose of the soma is to integrate all the incoming signals from itsdendrites (signals that come from other neurons) and then yield a subsequentimpulse down its axon—or not, as the case may be. The concept of threshold istherefore crucial here. For simplicity’s sake, if there are a certain number ofimpulses received by the soma from other neurons, then the firing threshold willbe met and an impulse will be passed on down the axon. Conversely, if theparticular threshold is not met, there will be no impulse sent down the axon.Don’t relax yet, for there is one more important fact to consider. Neurons canbe excitatory or inhibitory. If the neuron is excitatory, then if it fires, asits name suggests, its impulse will be one that tends to cause excitation inother neurons with which it connects. In other words its impulse will add to thechances of the next neuron in line firing as well. On the other hand, inhibitoryneurons, should they fire, will decrease the chances of the next neuron in linefiring.To use the suspended tree analogy again, imagine that the roots receive onehundred impulses from the nearby branches of other trees below. The majority ofthese impulses, let’s say, are inhibitory—that is, their inherent message beingconveyed to the tree is “do not fire an impulse.” After these signals areprocessed by the lower trunk of the tree, a resultant impulse is therefore notpassed along to the upper trunk and branches, and therefore no signal isconveyed to subsequent trees above.And there you have it—the essential features of the brain’s highly sophisticatedneuronal machinery in a nutshell. Information is transmitted and processed bythe brain through the collective firing patterns of billions of neurons. Likethe myriad on-off bit components of a computer, unbelievably large systems ofneurons are able to carry out various computational processes and procedures,although the brain’s capacity to compute and literally think far outstrips theability of any currently existing computer. The emergence of a sentient HAL-likeor Skynet-like computer system that worries about being turned off or wants towage war on us is unlikely. For whereas computers might be good at numericalcalculation and other well-defined logical operations, they fail miserably whenit comes to carrying out the types of thinking that we do all the time, like howto cross a really busy street while simultaneously contemplating a Shakespeareanmetaphor. Perhaps if computers were born into a society of computers, were ableto form intricately detailed models of reality, and were able to continuallyrewrite themselves, then maybe they might eventually come to possess mindfulcharacteristics. As it stands, what partly determines human consciousness andthe human self are the vast webs of social and societal relations that impingeon us, the complex internal models of reality that we build and store, and thecontinual learning processes we undertake.When considering the organized neuronal activity of the human brain, what wemust actively strive to appreciate is the enormity of the system and thedifferent patterns of impulse firing that the whole system can potentiallyembody. Not only are there billions of discrete neuronal firing devices, theamount of connectivity between them almost defies calculation. It has beenestimated that each individual neuron can potentially pass on impulses to asmany as ten thousand other neurons and may be in receipt of as many as fiftythousand potential impulses from other neurons. In our tree analogy, each treewould therefore be able to receive impulses and pass them on to vast forests ofother trees.Based on the above figures it has been calculated that the informational-storagecapacity of the human brain is comparable to the content of all the books everwritten. It is this bewildering capacity to process and store information thatmakes the human mind as rich and as complex as it appears to be. Without thebrain’s ability to continually channel and organize billions of bits ofinformation, the conscious human psyche as we know it could not exist.This wealth of neuronal complexity that we all carry around in our big heads isstaggering to say the least. At any one moment the entire network can be in anessentially infinite number of states of firing, and somewhere within thisinformational complexity lies our consciousness—who and what we are. Beforedwelling on this obviously compelling mystery, there is yet more relevant datato consider. According to the outline of neurons given thus far, it might beassumed that they contact one another directly. We might suppose that theterminal fibers of neurons pass on their firing impulses directly to thedendrites of other neurons. In the tree analogy this infers that the branch tipsof one tree touch the roots of other trees. However, this is not the case. Whatis more, the actual mechanism by which neurons relay their electrochemicallymediated information to one another is the very place where psychoactivesubstances like psilocybin and your morning cup of caffeine-enriched coffee arebelieved to operate. To be more precise, the synapse is where it’s all at.A Fantastic Journey into the SynapseThe synapse is the junction between two neurons, the place where theycommunicate, and it is arguably the most interesting feature of neuronalactivity, for it operates with chemical substances that psychoactive drugsresemble. In fact, as we shall shortly see, most psychoactive drugs work bymimicking the endogenous chemical substances employed at the brain’s synapticsites.The chemicals employed at the neuronal synapse are called neurotransmitterssince they are the chemical agents that allow neurons to transmit theirelectrochemical impulses to one another. Instead of one neuron directly fusingonto another, there is an intervening gap between them—the synapticcleft—through which impulses must perforce be conveyed if they are to pass ontheir signal. This synaptic gap is so small that it can be discerned only withthe aid of an electron microscope. Yet despite its microscopic size, atremendous amount of chemical activity can and does occur in the synaptic cleftso that, in reality, the microscopic gap is more of a busy molecular chasm.Basically, when an electrochemical impulse reaches the synapses at the endregions of the neuron’s terminal fibers (the tips of the branches in our treeanalogy), it causes a neurotransmitter substance to be released into thesynaptic cleft. After this substance has flooded the intervening synaptic space,some of its molecules bind themselves to special proteins called receptorslocated on the surface of the dendrites of the receiving neuron. After thebinding has occurred, these receptors cause changes in the biochemistry of thereceiving neuron. These changes then alter the electrical properties of theneuron and, if a certain threshold of activation is met, the original impulsewill be regenerated in this neuron and subsequently be passed on to otherneurons.To fully explain the scope, scale, and intricacy of synaptic informationtransmission, permit me to employ another picturesque analogy. Instead of aterminal fiber/dendrite synapse, think of two train tunnels that do not meet buthave an intervening space of, say, ten meters between them. Furthermore, imaginethat a train speeds along one of the tunnels at hundreds of miles per hour. Thisis akin to a high-velocity electrochemical impulse traveling along a neuron. Notdogged by track problems, this Intercity Electrochemical Impulse Express reachesthe end of the tunnel and duly crashes onto specially constructed buffers. Thedramatic impact upon the buffers causes a group of strategically placed gascanisters to explode, thus dispersing their gaseous contents into the gapbetween the two tunnels. The gases instantaneously diffuse across the gap andcause a reaction to occur in a stationary train situated at the start of thenext tunnel. As soon as molecules of the gas reach the next train, a neatreaction occurs in which the engine roars and the train is off, at the samespeed as the first train. Meanwhile the gas molecules in the gap are immediatelymopped up (and then conveniently recycled) so that they do not cause thereplacement train (that magically appears almost instantly to replace the onethat just sped off) to start up also. And in the first tunnel the original trainhas also been removed in order to allow another to follow if need be.This analogy captures in essence the manner in which information flows at asingle synapse. Although one might argue that a speeding train is a physicalthing and an electrochemical impulse is not strictly a physical thing, the mostimportant feature is the activity of the system and its informational state atany given moment. We could equally imagine a speeding band of fluorescent lightor even a speeding vortex of turbulent air traveling down the tunnels; it doesnot matter. What really matters is the informational state of the components ofthe system—their relations with one another. In the actual neuronal synapsethese crucial relations are defined by the chemical constituency of the wholesystem, that is, where and what effects various neurotransmitters are having onthe different parts of the synapse.If the synapse is starting to sound ridiculously complex, we should also keep inmind that the synaptic transmission of an impulse outlined above takes place inno more than 100 microseconds. In this outrageously short space of time,hundreds of thousands of neurotransmitter molecules are released from theterminal fibers of one neuron, are diffused across the synaptic cleft, come toattach themselves to special receptors on the dendrite of the next neuron, causean electrochemical impulse to be generated (or not), and are finally reabsorbedand recycled for further use by the first neuron. All this in one hundredmillionths of a second! Truly the mind boggles at the very processes underlyingits boggling!Despite the awesome intricacies of the neuronal system and any disbelief wemight have that Nature could fashion such exquisite nanotechnologicalarchitectures, I have deliberately ignored many of the other important featuresinvolved in the neuronal transmission of information. For instance, theelectrochemical impulse that shoots through the neuron is itself chock-a-blockwith chemical complexity. We find outrageously sophisticated potassium andsodium chemical pumps in the axon; we find vast oceans of charged particles, orions, being continuously pumped in and out of the axon through special membranechannels so that an electrical current is created; and we witness, finally, theaforementioned emergent wave of electrical activity whizzing along the axon tothe terminal fibers and on to the synapses. That is the least that can be saidabout Nature’s wondrous evolutionary endeavors in crafting the mammalian brain.In general, a major conceptual flaw in our understanding of the workings ofneurons is the distinct lack of appreciation for their relative size and speedof activity, an unfortunate fact that I am at pains to rectify here. Our modesof inquiry tend to gloss over complexity. True, we don’t have to marvel, gasp,and sit down in amazement at neuronal phenomena, yet to not do so (marvel atleast) is to overlook the subtlest fruits of the evolutionary process.So, although we can examine individual neurons and ascertain the mechanismwhereby they transmit information, and although we can recognize the role ofneurotransmitter substances in propagating information from neuron to neuronthrough the synapse, traditional scientific approaches tend to fail dismally infully conveying, in a qualitative sense, the immense organizational complexityinvolved in the neuronal system as a whole.Textbooks, for clarity, describe single neurons and single synapses in a fairlycold and reductive manner. What seems never to be stressed is the magnitude ofelectrochemical changes that zip throughout the conscious brain. Literallybillions of coordinated and meaningful molecular events occurring in literallybillions of discrete locations at every moment are somehow integrated so thatorganized sense results. This is information processing with a vengeance!If, then, we are attempting to marry such neuronal activity with psychologicalactivity (consciousness), that is, if we are attempting to bridge the conceptualgap between mental reality and physical reality, then we must appreciate theorganizational complexities involved. If we were merely to skate over theimmensity of these processes, we would miss an intuitive feel for the entiresystem.Neuronal Patterns and ContextReturning to the concept of organized patterns of neuronal firing, this becomesuseful when we consider the way the brain must work in everyday situations. Ifwe take some important psychological function like, say, face recognition, wecan see that the particular pattern of neuronal firing caused by nerve impulsesissuing from the visual system when it is looking at a face will be, for anyparticular face, unique. In other words, each face we see will generate a uniquepattern of neuronal firing—the face’s neuronal signature—in our brain.Furthermore, the neuronal processing of faces appears to reside in a specificarea of the brain that can be selectively damaged, resulting in prosopagnosia, adisorder in which the sufferer fails to recognize faces, even those of closefamily members.Similarly, we recognize different people’s voices by virtue of the fact thateach voice causes a distinct pattern of neuronal firing that is conducted fromthe auditory senses to deep within the brain. Eventually this pattern ofinformation reaches that part of the brain where acoustical information isanalyzed and recognized. The same is true for different tastes. Each type offood or drink we consume causes a different pattern of nerve impulses to begenerated, which finally reaches that part of the brain that deals in theperception of taste.In each of these cases, the neuronal pattern produced through the sensing of aparticular face, voice, or taste will, at some stage, need to be compared withother possible neuronal patterns in order to yield its particular meaning andsignificance. Therefore, the different processing systems of the brain must act,in part, to provide a context for ongoing neuronal patterns. Without acontextual effect, neuronal patterns would not be able to yield their inherentmeaning. The brain’s capacity to provide a precise context for ongoing neuronalpatterns is thus crucial in understanding how neuronal activity and neuronalfiring patterns become meaningful.The Berkeley psychology professor Bernard J. Baars has noted the importance ofcontextual effects in giving meaning to ongoing neuronal patterns. In ACognitive Theory of Consciousness he writes: “We generally gain informationabout a world that is locally ambiguous, yet we usually experience a stable,coherent world. This suggests that before input becomes conscious, it interactswith numerous unconscious contextual influences to produce a single, coherent,conscious experience. Consciousness and context are twin issues, inseparable inthe nature of things.”1 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts27]Although a detailed look at all the intricacies of neuronal firing patterns isbeyond the scope of this book, for the time being it is enough that we grasp theessential principles that are likely to be involved in the brain’s processing ofinformation. Organized neuronal patterns arising from, say, visible externalstimuli contain a wealth of latent information about the stimuli, which is tosay that the neuronal patterns are representations of those stimuli. The latentinformation in these neuronal representations then gets “read” once the neuronalpatterns are contextually processed. The brain, by supplying a context forneuronal representations, is able to access the meaning inherent in them.One neurophilosophical approach to understanding mental states is that offunctionalism, which, despite its dreary name, captures the important role ofcontext in conscious brain processes. Essentially, functionalism views firingstates of the brain as playing functional roles in an economy or language ofpossible firing states, which is another way of describing the type ofcontextual effects outlined above. Any neuronal firing state of the brainderives its significance and meaning from the functional role that it playswithin a language of possible states. All possible states are related to oneanother (just as all words in the English language are related to one another),and it is the network of relations (stored within the brain’s memory systems)that acts as context.We now have at least a preliminary handle on the fundamental way that theneuronal brain operates. Patterns of neuronal firing embody information andmeaning that is read or accessed by the brain through language-likecontextual/relational effects. Conscious experience appears to be intimatelybound somewhere within this information-processing system, since it isconsciousness that comes to experience meaning. We see faces and we know whothey are. We see pictures and we see what they mean. We hear sounds and we knowwhat they signify. Consciousness is therefore substantiated within neuronalinformation processing, and it begins to look as if consciousness itself is aform of information that emerges at the highest and most integrated level of theneuronal system.With these speculations in mind, let us look at the way that psychoactivesubstances influence neurons, synapses, and, of course, consciousness. This iswhere physical processes can be seen to be connected directly to changes inconsciousness, an area of analysis teeming with profound implications,especially when we consider the effects of psilocybin. More important, we mightascertain still more clearly how consciousness can be understood as a form ofinformation.Chemistry and the MindThere are drugs and there are drugs. To be precise, there are five principalclasses of drugs that alter mood and behavior, some of which we have already metand discussed. There are depressants like alcohol, barbiturates, Valium, andanesthetics; stimulants like amphetamines (speed), cocaine, caffeine, andnicotine; opiates like opium, heroin, and morphine; antipsychotics likechlorpromazine and risperidone; and last but by absolutely no means least, thereare psychedelics or entheogens like psilocybin, mescaline, LSD, and DMT.Cannabis and the synthetic club drug Ecstasy (MDMA) are sometimes classified aspsychedelics as well.The substances listed here as psychedelic could be further divided according tothe precise effect they have, but this basic classification will suffice for thefollowing discussion, which focuses on the way these substances are believed towork. Although we will briefly look at each class of substance, the mostattention will be paid to the known neuro-physiological effects of psilocybin.The predominant effect of depressants is to depress, or deaden, neuronalactivity. Consider anesthetics. They are so strong in their depressant actionthat beyond the state of general anesthesia that they induce, there lies onlycoma and death. It is believed that once anesthetics have been administered,they reach the brain and inhibit neuronal firing so much that consciousness is“lost.” Therefore it is clear that without adequate neuronal firing there can beno information processing or information conductance and hence no mindfulness.Here we have yet more proof that consciousness is bound up with the billionfoldaction of activated neurons in the brain.If we take another depressant drug, like alcohol, we find that it too acts toinhibit neuronal firing throughout the brain, and hence consciousness becomesdepressed or reduced. However, at low doses the opposite effect takes place,whereby there is a certain degree of psychological stimulation because of theinitial depression of the inhibitory synapses, which, as you will recall, serveto diminish neuronal firing. However, soon after these inhibitory neurons aredepressed, excitatory neurons begin to be depressed as well, and this effectcomes to dominate the ensuing state of consciousness.Not only do depressants inhibit neuronal firing in the brain, they also appearto depress the activity of the body’s other nerves, heart tissue, and muscletissue. More specifically, depressants upset the functioning of the arousalcenters in the brain such that psychological arousal and stimulation arediminished. In short, the quantity of consciousness is reduced due to aconcurrent reduction in neuronal firing, and there is less informationalpatterning and less informational organization happening within the neuronalsystems of the brain once a depressant drug has been introduced.Stimulants have the opposite effect of depressants. Cocaine and amphetamineseach work in virtually the same way, causing almost identical stimulatoryeffects like euphoria, an increase in alertness, an elevation of mood, and areduction in fatigue. Indeed, cocaine is derived from the coca plant, the leavesof which are still chewed daily by millions of native South Americans preciselyfor the resultant psychological stimulation and reduction in perceived tirednessand hunger. This latter “productive” effect of the coca leaf explains the factthat while the sixteenth-century Spanish conquistadors outlawed the religioususe of sacred mushrooms, peoples like the Incas were allowed to continue theirpractice of chewing coca leaves as long as they slaved away in Spanish goldmines.Amphetamines are believed to mimic and increase the activity of theneurotransmitters noradrenaline and dopamine (the brain uses many differenttypes of neurotransmitter), thus interfering with the normal synapticfunctioning of neurons using these neurotransmitters. This happens partlybecause amphetamines are similar in molecular structure to both noradrenalineand dopamine. Because of this resemblance, amphetamines literally invade thoseneuronal areas where synaptic transmission with these transmitters occurs andincrease the rate of impulse generation. Once this occurs, the typical“speeding” psychological responses take hold.With cocaine a similar tale unfolds. In this case, however, it appears thatcocaine inhibits the recycling (the “mopping up”) of noradrenaline and dopaminewithin synapses after they have done their work. Because of this selectiveinterference, there are more neurotransmitters “hanging around” in synapses andtherefore more of them to stimulate receiving neurons into excitatory action.In both cases, the chief neurological effect is that of an increase in synapticactivity that causes stimulation of the nervous system. Again we see that thestimulating alteration in consciousness caused by these drugs is due to anincrease in the information-processing activity of certain types of neuron, inthis case, neurons utilizing noradrenaline and dopamine. Increased neuronalactivity of this kind then generates the desired psychological stimulation, or“high.” It is important to bear in mind, however, that the increased neuronalactivity in this case does not lead to any kind of profound visionaryexperience. Such radical phenomenology is restricted to psychedelics.With tea and coffee, the active ingredient, caffeine, is believed to increaserates of cellular metabolism, thus making more energy available to cells. Thenet result of this action is once again an elevated rate of neuronal firing,which explains the subtle stimulatory properties of tea and coffee and theirwidespread use.The third class of psychoactive substance on our list is opiates, which arederived from the opium poppy. The opiates are interesting for their variety ofpowerful effects. The worldwide painkiller morphine is an invaluable opiate, andits chemical isolation from the opium poppy radically revolutionized medicineand pain control. Morphine seems to selectively bind to opiate receptors in thebrain, which suggests that the brain has its own pain-control mechanisms.Indeed, it has been proposed that acupuncture and hypnosis might be able toreduce pain because they encourage the brain to generate its own endorphins,which are natural opiate substances that bind to opiate receptors (endorphinsare also believed to be the cause of the high often experienced after rigorousexercise). Once these opiate receptors are activated, the emotional perceptionof pain diminishes—as opposed to a diminishing of the actual pain impulsesarriving from the site of injury. Along with opium and heroin (a semisyntheticcompound), morphine also generates euphoria, and this is associated with theemotional changes wrought through the activation of the nervous system’s opiatereceptors.With the fourth class of drugs, the antipsychotics, we find synthetic compoundssuch as risperidone being used the world over to treat mental diseases,including schizophrenia. Perhaps the most common neuropsychological theory holdsthat schizophrenia results from an excess of the substance dopamine within thebrain. Dopamine, of course, is a major neurotransmitter that we met when welooked at the neurological effect of stimulants.The excess-dopamine explanation for schizophrenia is supported by the effects ofrisperidone, which can diminish the symptoms of this disease. Becauserisperidone operates partly by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain, it islogical to assume that an excess of dopaminergic neuronal activity lies at theheart of schizophrenia. This speculation leads to the intriguing conclusion thatsomehow an elevation in the activity of dopamine-using neurons is intimatelybound with the strange delusions and belief systems of the unfortunate mindsuffering from schizophrenia. By blocking the excess dopamine at the receptorsites, risperidone helps to block disorders of thought.Here we have another strong clue about how to unravel the mysteries of theformation and emergence of complex consciousness—for schizophrenia is notedprecisely for its disruptions of those higher levels of awareness that pertainto reality conception. Furthermore, these large-scale disruptions in thoughtappear to be nonrandom in that certain definite types of delusion are observed,often related to feelings of paranoia and the belief that one is beingcontrolled by horribly malevolent external forces. If dopaminergic synapticoveractivity really is to blame for these global disorders of thought, we canbegin to conceive how large patterns of abnormal neuronal firing yield largedisorders of cognition, such as paranoid delusions and the like. If neuronalactivity becomes too overactive and too “wild,” then the resultant firingpatterns might well be “flawed,” which is to say that these patterns areessentially mistakes serving to mislead the experiencer. Or, if there is somenegative disruption in the overall way in which the schizophrenic conceivesreality, then the schizophrenic’s model of reality will provide a faultycontextual effect on ongoing neuronal activity.Obviously the human brain is a finely tuned information-processing instrument.If the neuronal events substantiating some kinds of information processing arepushed too far from some criteria, or if neuronal events are “read” by anerroneous contextual system, faulty processing occurs, with its resultantnegative disruption of consciousness.Neuro-alchemical MagicFinally we come to the class of compounds known as psychedelics or entheogens.Admittedly it has been a little tough getting here, yet the journey is worth it.We are now ready to home in even closer to the link between neuronal chemistryand consciousness. Entheogens are by far the most interesting of all knownpsychoactive substances, although precious little is known about exactly howthey are able to generate such a remarkable array of psychological effects.Entheogens are often referred to by unwary clinicians as hallucinogens, yet thisterm suggests that hallucinations are produced. The general definition of ahallucination is that of a perceived object in three-dimensional space that isin actuality not there—a bit like seeing a ghost or mirage. But this is not atypical effect, as I hope I have shown in previous chapters. In fact, one of themost prominent effects of substances like psilocybin is the production ofcomplex visionary scenes that unfold behind closed eyes, along with a perceivedincrease in the realness of the external world as viewed with eyes open. Morespecifically, one does not hallucinate nonexistent objects; rather, one comes tosee external reality in a new and more enhanced way. It is for these reasonsthat the term entheogen or psychedelic (literally mind-manifesting) is preferredto classify these particular substances.It is believed that psilocybin works by mimicking the neurotransmitter serotonin(known as 5-HT), one of the most important and widespread of the brain’ssynaptic messengers. The mimicking occurs because psilocin (the activemetabolite of psilocybin that is formed in the body) possesses a molecularstructure almost identical to serotonin. Psilocin’s shape is so similar toserotonin that it is able to infiltrate parts of the brain that processinformation using serotonergic synapses.Serotonin is employed in a number of brain structures that control functionslike sleep, mood, and general arousal. One of these structures is the raphesystem at the base of the brain, whose serotonergic neuronal axons project toall other major areas of the brain, notably the limbic system (which controlsemotional responses) and areas of the visual system.Research indicates that the serotonin-using raphe system has a homeostatic, orbalancing, function in which two primary effects emerge. First, in the wakingstate the system acts to enhance the activity of motor neurons, which govern thecontrol of muscular movement. Second, and more significant, during the wakingstate this same serotonergic system acts to suppress sensory systems, whichrelay information about the external world. This second effect appears to screenout, or filter out, distracting sensory information. Furthermore, it has beenspeculated that this filtering mechanism allows us to perceive reality in asteady way, almost as if the serotonergic raphe system were a balancing stickenabling us to walk the “tightrope” of normal perceptual awareness. If thisserotonergic homeostatic balancing system is interfered with, then theperception of reality will be correspondingly altered, so much so that we mayplunge off the tightrope into new dimensions of perceived reality. Chemicallydismantling the raphe system’s screening effect would therefore admit the entryof latent information into consciousness. Is this how visionary agents likepsilocybin work?Most of the detailed physiological experimentation that was carried out withpsychedelics in the 1960s concentrated on LSD and psilocybin and used ratbrains, cat brains, and isolated rat neurons. Perhaps the most important findingwas indeed that LSD and psilocybin depress the action of serotonin neurons inthe raphe system (a neuronal system shared by rats, cats, and humans).The usual activity of the particular serotonergic neurons that psilocin and LSDdepress is inhibitory, which means that their normal firing serves to dampen orsuppress activity in those parts of the brain with which they synapse. Thus itwas believed that psilocybin and LSD’s dampening effect on serotonergic neuronsfacilitated an increase in neuronal firing in those areas of the brain incontact with the raphe system (like the aforementioned visual and limbic/emotionsystems). It was this effect, this enhancement of neuronal activation, that wasbelieved to correlate with the psychedelic experience itself.It seemed like a nice, neat theory. However, the above scenario does not takeinto account the recently discovered neuropharmacological action of mescaline,another classic entheogen. With not a little irritation we find that, likepsilocybin, mescaline induces the full spectrum of visionary phenomenology, butit is not known to significantly influence the raphe system. Therefore our raphetheory cannot be the whole story.Research over the past decade has revealed that there are distinct kinds ofserotonin receptors, or serotonin binding sites, within the brain. In otherwords, neurons that are modulated by the release of serotonin from other neuronswith which they synapse are not tied down to just one kind of serotoninreceptor. In typical fashion, Nature has made things more complex and intriguingthan that. In fact, there are different kinds of serotonin receptor (classifiedby grouping them into subtype receptors), and it is believed that differentpsychedelic drugs have differential effects upon these receptors. One particularserotonin receptor, however—the so-called 5-HT2A type—appears to represent acommon site of action for both psilocybin and mescaline.The 5-HT2A receptors are found throughout the cortex and also in abundance inthe brain system known as the locus coeruleus, which, like the raphe, issituated at the base of the brain. The locus coeruleus processes so many sensoryinputs (a flow of incoming data, if you like) that it is considered to functionas a “novelty detector” and is able to influence one’s state of arousal. Bymonitoring the constant surge of “electrochemical traffic” passing through it,the locus coeruleus is able to detect changes in the flow of data and alertother parts of the brain. When something changes in the environment around us,the locus coeruleus alerts the rest of the brain to the change. Both psilocinand mescaline bind to these 5-HT2A sites in the locus coeruleus and therebyalter the functioning of this system, ultimately raising levels of arousal. Inother words, it once again seems that psychedelics function by making moreinformation available to the experiencer.This explanation is still not the full story, however, as pharmacology expertprofessor David Nichols attests.5-HT2A receptor sites are located in a number of other key areas of the brain.Importantly, they are located on neurons in the frontal cortex called pyramidalcells. The frontal cortex is often referred to as the area where executivedecisions are made. It is there that we make sense of all the information thatis arriving. It is a sort of conscious integrating center where the brain makesdecisions about what to do about all the information that it is receiving.Laugh? Cry? Get up and go to the bathroom? Experiments . . . suggest thatstimulation of 5-HT2A receptors makes these pyramidal cells fire more easily,thus enabling them to process more information.2[../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts28]Professor Nichols also points out yet another area of the brain that might beinvolved in entheogenesis.There is an area in the middle of the brain called the thalamus. The thalamus isa relay station through which all of the sensory information we receive (exceptfor smell) is sent to the cortex. This part of the brain is sometimes called the“searchlight” of attention. It is wrapped in yet another layer of neurons calledthe reticular nucleus of the thalamus, and it is this layer that helps tocontrol which sensory information actually gets through the thalamus and is senton to the cortex. The 5-HT2A receptor is located on neurons in both of these twoareas, so its activation has a direct effect on the control and flow ofinformation that ultimately reaches the cortex. It is thought that psilocybinand LSD decrease the efficiency of this thalamic filter or gating mechanism, andallow much more information to be sent to the cortex.3[../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts29]Despite introducing yet more areas of the brain, Professor Nichols appears toconcur that the chief effect of psilocybin is an increase in informationalactivity in those areas of the brain involved with consciousness. As far as Ican see, given all the scientific data at hand, a basic conclusion along theselines seems inevitable.The Novel Orchestration of InformationWe are now in a position to summarize the above findings in fairlystraightforward terms: the net result of psilocybin’s combined effects upon thelocus coeruleus, the raphe system, the thalamus, and cortical cells is anincrease in neuronal firing in the cortex, a concurrent increase inconsciousness (an expansion of perceived reality), and the emergence of oftenspectacular visions behind closed eyes.Only the second of those claims is in any way contentious, for I suggest anincrease in consciousness. Others might argue that the increase in neuronalfiring in the brain is more of an unwelcome dysfunction than a constructiveeffect. However, a negative judgment like this misses the implications of theentheogenic state of mind. After all, Huxley claimed that psychedelics could,through an act of “gratuitous grace,” permit one access to perceptualinformation that was “out there,” but not normally needed because from anevolutionary standpoint we need only information regarding things like food andsafety. Or at least those are the sorts of thing it has been essential to knowin our evolutionary past. Of course for Huxley and other champions of thepsychedelic experience, the knowledge made available through visionary plant andfungal alkaloids was suddenly very important in the light of contemporaryWestern culture. A transcendental reality appeared to be awaiting us, ready toerupt amid the mundane and oft-profane trudge of human history.Armed with modern data on serotonin receptors, we can see that Huxley wascorrect in his pioneering conjectures. Once entheogenic compounds have enteredthe brain, an increase in neuronal activity (that is, an increase in neuronalexcitation and electrochemical information processing) takes place—hence moreinformation does indeed become accessible to the mind. In particular, the partsof the brain that become more activated are involved with novelty detection,arousal, emotions, the relaying of sensory information, and making sense of itall.But what exactly does it mean that there is an increase in neuronalinformational activity? Just how valid and “real” are the novel patterns ofneuronal firing galvanized by psilocybin? Indeed, how can novel patterns ofneuronal firing actually be conscious thoughts? From here on, the ground getsmore uncertain, mainly because the brain is such an astonishingly complicatedorgan. However, before we go on to speculate and deal further with what has beensaid thus far, there is one more piece of information we should consider, namelythe role of serotonergic neurons in the process of dreaming.Sleeping Dreams and Waking DreamsREM sleep, or rapid eye movement sleep, is that part of the sleep cycle in whichwe dream the most vividly. Sleep, let alone dreaming, is a peculiar thing,especially since we spend about a third of our lives succumbing to it. Despitesuch a dramatic nightly encumbrance, science has yet to reach a universalconsensus regarding why we sleep, for one can come up with plenty of argumentsthat counter explanations that view sleep as a purely restorative process.Proneness to attack comes to mind, for when else are we so passively obliviousto our surroundings? As for our need to dream, there are again numeroustheories, from odd theories that we dream to forget, to theories that we dreamto consolidate information.Although we might not remember our dreams, it is vital that we engage in REMsleep each night. Sleep researchers have found that if periods of REM sleep areselectively disrupted, it results in a rebound effect whereby the next night,barring any more selective interference from researchers, there will be an extraamount of REM, or dreaming. We absolutely must dream, and therefore dreaming hasto be related to some very important informational process of the brain.Neuroscientist B. L. Jacobs has carried out experiments that show that asuppression of serotonergic neuronal activity elicits dreaming. If cats(unfortunately these most loveable creatures are often used for questionablebrain-meddling sleep experiments) are injected with a chemical called PCPA,which is known to deplete serotonin supplies in all parts of the brain, the catsexhibit brain-wave patterns consistent with the onset of dreaming, despite thefact that they are fully awake. In other words, argues Jacobs, the cats areexperiencing waking dreams. Therefore, waking dreams are somehow associated withlow levels of serotonin. Indeed, during dream sleep, serotonergic cells in theraphe system turn off completely so that they cease having a depressant effecton other parts of the brain, a process that echoes the effects of psilocybinupon the raphe system.The conclusion reached is that dreaming is associated with a form of neuronalfiring normally kept at bay by inhibitory serotonergic neurons until the onsetof sleep. More important, the visions produced by psychedelic agents likepsilocybin might be the result of waking dreams, or at least they might emergefrom self-organizing neuronal processes that are similar to those processesoccurring while we dream. The essential principle appears to be the coalescingof information into meaningful patterns. This idea is not only compelling, italso seems intuitively correct; the psilocybin mushroom allows one to experiencedreamlike consciousness while awake, which takes the form of intensely movingvisions behind closed eyes.According to the various documented cases of the shamanic visionary state,psychedelic visions are indeed dreamlike, the only difference being that one isimmeasurably more conscious during visions than in dreams (even lucid ones) andone is able to remember them vividly, unlike dreams, which often fade quickly.Whereas most people cannot, offhand, recall most of the thousands of dreams thatthey all must have had, psilocybin visions remain fairly emblazoned upon thememory like favorite movie clips.To be sure, the suggestion that psilocybin visions are dreamlike istheoretically useful, yet it seriously downplays their dramatic impact and“Otherness.” But because there is clearly some similarity in the chemical basisand phenomenological quality of dreams and psychedelic visionary episodes, theirrelationship—in terms of neuronal processes—demands further exploration, and sothis is where we head, in part, in the next chapter. We must bear in mind thoughthat the vision-generating side of the mushroom experience is only the half ofit, since the altered perception of reality with eyes open is of equal interest.However, as stated, both these phenomena are intimately related to theprocessing of information within the neuronal systems of the brain, and wetherefore need to begin thinking more deeply about the relationship betweenbillionfold patterns of neuronal firing and consciousness. I have alreadyintroduced the idea that vast patterns of orchestrated neuronal firing areconscious experience, yet this concept is so profound that I shall repeatedlyreturn to it in order to fully explore its worth as an explanatory model forunderstanding the nature of the brain and mind.Whether it be a vivid dream or an entheogenic vision, the normal perception ofan object or a psychedelic perception, the underlying structure of suchexperiences can now be discerned. The common mediating factor is information,and the way that information is transmitted, organized, and substantiated by theneuronal firing activity of the brain. Information, the “currency” of the brain,emerges as the key concept in explaining the normal conscious mind, theentheogenic mind, and the dreaming mind. We continue our avid investigations inthe next chapter, as we spiral in toward the secret of the sacred mushroom."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/9781594779374_002.jpg]S I XThe Stuff of ConsciousnessThe purpose of this and the following chapters is to build on the ideaspreviously introduced to further get a handle on the mind, or consciousness, andhow it is possible for one to experience a transcendental communion with aseeming Other. At this juncture I repeat that I believe mind stuff to beinformation, or at any rate that consciousness is an informational patternembodied within the neuronal firing system of the brain. Moreover, it seemslikely that psilocybin works by enabling novel patterns of information to emergethat are not normally “permitted” due to the default constraints that usuallyoperate in the brain. This much seems clear from what has already been saidabout the way in which neuronal firing substantiates informational states andhow such informational states are dramatically altered through the chemicalaction of entheogenic compounds.In other words, mind stuff resolves itself as being informational stuff. This isperhaps not too controversial a claim, but what I eventually hope to show isthat matter, or physical stuff, is also informational in nature. This would meanthat everything, whether atoms, molecules, organisms, or thoughts, could bedescribed in informational terms. The mind and body could then be seen asconsisting of essentially the same kind of substance, that is, as particularforms of information.Of course the concept of what information itself is, or what informationactually means, is a decidedly muddy issue, despite the fact that we now live inthe Age of Information. Books carry information, as do DVDs, apple seeds, bankstatements, fossils, fiber-optic cables, hormones, food wrappers, and the humangenome. So too do vast networks of firing neurons carry information, whetherinfused with psilocybin or not. As to the notion of atoms (of which theabove-mentioned information-carriers are all composed) being units ofinformation also, the case is less clear. However, should I succeed in thecoming chapters in defining both consciousness and matter in informationalterms, then I should also be able to explain more clearly why psilocybin is ableto generate both Other-derived visions and an altered perception of reality—allin terms of the flow and flux of information. In fact, armed with a sweepinglynew informational view of reality, one might come to perceive oneself and theworld with a new outlook. Indeed, the information paradigm of which I speakyields a whole array of truly stunning conceptual consequences.Mind and BodyThe issue confronting us—that of understanding consciousness—is, as you probablyrealize, a decidedly hoary beast, covered in thorns and about as amenable toclose analysis as is the wind on a very blustery day. Formally speaking, it isknown in the philosophical trade as the mind/ body problem. At its heart liesthe seemingly inseparable gulf between the world of physical matter and theworld of consciousness. We know much about the structure and behavior of theformer, yet relatively little about the latter. Before we go on with our questto understand the nature of consciousness in the light of the psilocybinexperience, let’s take a very brief look at the history of this most murkyphilosophical quagmire.The seventeenth-century French philosopher Descartes is generally credited withfully appreciating and documenting the mind/body dilemma. Descartes concludedthat there were two sorts of universal stuff—mind and matter—and that theyinteracted in some mysterious ghostlike way. This dualistic “ghost in themachine” view of consciousness has annoyed many a philosopher and scientistalike. Especially scientists, for they do not like talk of incorporeal entities(elusive minds) not located in three-dimensional space being somehow able tointeract with matter. Perhaps this explains why most psychologists have untilquite recently been content to ignore the issue of consciousness. It is such anenigmatic phenomenon, and yet it is consciousness that is the very core of ourbeing.Consciousness defines you right now, for instance. This book might be physicaland clearly tangible, yet what are your thoughts to know this? And even moreproblematic is the mind’s ability to act directly upon matter through the body.How can a thought that is non-weighable and not made of physical particlesnonetheless be able to move the collective atoms in, say, one’s fingers? How cansome sort of informational pattern embodied within the brain act upon so-calledmatter?To reach some understanding we must either side with the old Cartesian dualisticbelief or launch ourselves wholeheartedly into an alternative “informationalmonism,” in which the reality process consists of only one stuff—information. AsI hope to show, the nature of the psilocybin experience suggests that we embracethe latter scenario.An Attempt to Exorcise the Ghost of DescartesSince the musings of Descartes, philosophers have engaged in a veritablefree-for-all in their attempts to either defend Descartes’ ideas or do away withthem and somehow unite mind with matter. Indeed, some academic philosophers makeit their professional business to immerse themselves night and day in themind/body problem. So annoyingly problematic is the existence of consciousnessin an apparently physical Universe that entire academic careers have been builton this subtle paradox. Row upon row of shelves in the philosophy section ofuniversity libraries are given over to books dealing in some way with themind/body problem.Still, as far as I am aware, not one professional mind/body philosopher hasbecome seriously involved with psychedelic experimentation in order to furtherour knowledge and insight into the dynamic interplay between chemistry andaltered states of awareness. In fact, most books purportedly dealing with theissue of consciousness patently ignore psychoactive substances altogether, as ifthey had nothing whatsoever to teach us. I suppose that most traditionalmind/body “specialists” balk and quiver at the very idea of psychedelicshamanism and its alchemical explorations of the mind. Maybe visionary plantsare simply too scary for armchair-bound philosophers to confront. Whatever thecase, entheogenic flora and fungi have remained a peripheral phenomenon, studiedsolely by anthropologists, ethnobotanists, and a handful of adventurousmavericks. It is hoped this state of indifference may soon be shattered and thatscience comes to properly address the delicate interface between chemistry andconsciousness.Chemistry and consciousness . . . what do such terms imply? The important answeris that, taken together, they directly address the boundary between the physicaland the psychological. Chemistry implies chemicals and substances—materialthings, in other words—whereas altered states of awareness lie in the realm ofthe intangible mind. We established in the last chapter that various types ofsubstance, particularly those with a close molecular resemblance to the brain’sneurotransmitters, appear to elicit fairly predictable and characteristicchanges in consciousness. If we consider psilocybin, we see that it bridgesperfectly the conceptual gap between the two seemingly incompatible worlds ofmind and matter, psychological and physical. The more we come to understand themodus operandi of psilocybin, the closer we get to divining the actual design ofthe bridge linking mind to matter.A tall order then, this attempt to resolve the age-old mind/body problem. Still,no harm will have been done should I fail miserably in my theoretical endeavors.After all, untenable solutions inevitably aid the formulation of soundsolutions, so the “psilocybin solution” should not have to be completelydiscarded. Bear with me then and judge for yourself as we embark on the nextstage of the sacred mushroom mystery tour. This will take us further intoinformational territory as we focus more closely on the structural dynamics ofpsychedelic visions. Because such visions seemingly depend in some vital way onthe integration and cohesion of large amounts of neuronal information, thenabove all else, an understanding of information is assuredly key to unlockingthe mystery of consciousness, whether of the psilocybinetic kind or of thenormal kind.Symbols in FormationWe have seen that one major aspect of the psilocybin experience—the perceptionof vivid visions with eyes closed—appears to be the result of dreaming whileawake, or at least something akin to this (this has nothing to do withdaydreaming, which is something else entirely). According to our previousanalysis, we can view such visions as being dynamic information patternsconveyed in the neuronal systems of the brain, information patterns that havebeen specifically “freed” to form themselves through the “liberating” action ofpsychedelic substances on serotonergic systems. Similarly, REM dreams wouldappear to be generated by the same “freed” neuronal systems.The fact that psychedelic visions are loaded with powerful and often universalsymbology might indicate that there are predetermined ways in which largeamounts of neuronal information can be organized and integrated. This introducesan important idea. Just as elements like carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygennaturally organize themselves into specific stable structures like water, carbondioxide, and amino acids, so too may information in the brain, in the form ofneuronal firing activity, organize itself in the same kind of way.The fundamental quality that makes, say, water the same everywhere is itsmolecular structure—the exact way in which molecules of hydrogen and oxygencohere. They form a specific pattern, a specific molecular expression. If myspeculations are correct, information embodied in systems of neuronal firinglikewise forms itself into specific structured patterns. And just as watermolecules can organize themselves still further into stable macroscopicpatterned structures like snowflakes, so too can more and more coherent forms ofinformation coalesce by way of the patterning processes occurring in thepsilocybin-influenced brain. Freezing temperatures (at least partly) help fosterthe structured patterns exhibited by snowflakes, whereas psilocybin helps fosterthe structured patterns of neuronal activity that come to be experienced asshamanic visions. Water molecules organize themselves according to the rules ofa molecular language; neuronal firing patterns organize themselves according tothe rules of a psychological language.If specific patterns and structures emerge from expansiveinformation-integration processes occurring within the brain, this would explainthe existence of universal symbology, universal dream images, and mythicalarchetypes. Throughout the world, in all of the countless religions,cosmologies, and mythologies created by our species, we come across highlysimilar mythical images and symbols full of meaning and associative power.The serpent is a good example of this universal symbology. It is found in thereligious mythology of the Maya and the Aztecs (who worshipped Quetzalcoatl—theFeathered Serpent); the ancient Egyptians (the headdresses of the pharaohsincorporated the viper as a symbol of wisdom and intellect); the Australianaborigines (who worshipped the Rainbow Serpent); and the ancient peoples ofIndia (who worshipped Nagas, literally wise serpents). Serpent mythology is alsofound in the ancient epic of Gilgamesh (a serpent tells of a mythical plant thatcan confer immortality) and in the Eden of the Old Testament (the wise butfeared serpent who offers forbidden fruit from the tree of knowledge). Moreoften than not, the serpent symbolizes a wise, divine, or spiritual life forceor deity.As we are on the subject of serpentine motifs, here is a relevant description ofmine in which I describe some typical visions instigated by the mushroom.Once, I remember seeing huge serpentine coils piled up upon one another andsomehow turning as if the cogs of some organic machine. Then I found myselfgliding toward a flexuous off-white mass which for the life of me I could notcomprehend. This rippled white stuff was everywhere, and I was being drawn intoit, suffocating almost as it surrounded me.Suddenly, seeing this mass close up, I realised what it was. It was convolutedbrain tissue. Spongy white cortical tissue, fold after fold of it. This was theimmense brain of some mythical Serpent related, I thought, to Gaia. I felt thatI was seeing a visual representation of the powerful intelligence of the Earthitself, the “Earth Brain” as it were.The scene then changed and I found myself touring a building that was made ofboth artery-laced flesh and conventional material. Each room seemed to have aparticular biological function. It was most bizarre. I appeared to be inside akind of visceral architecture that was breathing gases, pumping oceans of blood,and digesting vast vats of food.In fact, such visionary motifs indicating the fusion of man-made architecturewith biological structure were repeated a number of times. I often perceivedstately homes and palaces—or rather I would be gliding gracefully through suchpalatial places—and always, the woodwork, like the banisters, wall panels, orstaircases, would reveal themselves to be made of the body of a living creature.To be precise, I perceived that these buildings were woven from the jewelledbody of the Serpent. Everything was alive, all was part of one animate,constructing entity. And if I saw human figures in any of these scenes, they toowere formed out of the transmutating body of the Serpent. Everything in thesescenes had the stamp of the Serpent’s hide upon them, in that a kind ofpulsating grid of luminescent lines and scaly jewels pervaded every object.1[../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts30]Serpent motifs might be universal because, as with other mythical symbols, theyrepresent stable, organized concentrations of information. A symbol, such as themythical Serpent, embodies a large set of relations or, to be more specific, itis the point where a huge web of psychological relations converge. To fullyunderstand the symbol is to sense at once all of its relations to other objectsof perceptual experience. In other words, visual symbols play a role in apsychological language. (Here, I again invoke the concept of language sincelanguage is essentially an informational system not restricted to words alone.Language, in the abstract way in which I refer to it, is a system ofinformational elements bearing definite relations with one another; hence alanguage of words, of molecules, of symbols, and so forth.)Universally powerful visionary symbols can be thought of as expressions in thedictionary of a “higher” language connected with the human psyche. What I meanby “higher” is that the visual elements in this language are far more rich inmeaning and informational content than the words of our spoken language.Moreover, seeing visionary symbols choreographed together in a movielikefashion—as occurs in the psilocybinetic state—is to experience meaning inperhaps its purest, most informationally rich way. To partake of a visionarydialogue is to be overwhelmed by the direct apprehension of pure, unadulteratedmeaning, which arises as a consequence of the highly integrative informationalprocesses liberated by entheogenic compounds.In the metaphorical and visual language emanating from the most integratedinformation processing of the human psyche, the serpent therefore appears to bea significant “word” or icon, itself derived from the natural environment. Thereare many such universally potent icons derived from the natural environment. Trynow, if you would, to imagine in glorious Technicolor a volcano erupting, abutterfly emerging from its pupa, or a hand reaching into a flame. Furtherimagine all of the ways that potent symbolic images like these could bemeaningfully put together by some agency dissociated from the self or ego toconvey some message or idea to us. And finally, imagine an informationally richcreation like this being experienced directly by one’s consciousness with nointerference whatsoever. Here we begin to understand what the shamanic visionaryexperience is like, that it consists essentially of a communication transmittedin the higher language expressed by the Other, a language of symbols embodied inanimated imagery.See What I Mean?Seeing, it seems, is the most direct form of perception. This is why one comesto “see the truth.” It also explains why art is powerful. A great painting isunworded yet it may well speak volumes to us. Visual symbols and images can betruly effective in their capacity to inform. It is in this sense that I refer toa higher language of the psyche, a language not of words but of concentrationsof information visibly beheld.To really see something is to see what something really means, and to see whatsomething really means is to instantly access all of its inherent relations toother things. To see a powerful symbol, whether in a shamanic vision, a dream,or a spiritual piece of art, is to behold a concentration of information, asupercondensed concrescence of meaning.The idea then is that very large amounts of information can cohere and coalesceinto symbols, and, since all brains work in the same way, universal symbolsmight emerge in a language of symbols, just as universal expressions andmeanings emerge in all worded languages. But it should be stressed thatuniversal symbols are related to real objects in the shared world. Even if theyare not deified, snakes, for example, are generally at least feared the worldover, and for good reason, since their venom can prove fatal. This automaticallymeans that the real-world snake is going to be a good candidate for playing arole as a universal symbol wherever symbol-generating processes arise.Designer Symbols, Designer VisionsIn the case of entheogenic visions (or dreams), it might well be that theycontain not only universal symbols, but culturally determined symbols that canbe fully understood and appreciated only on a personal level. In the case ofmuch of South American shamanism, like that practiced by the ayahuasca-usingTukanoan Indians of Colombia, we do indeed find culturally determined symbologyin the visions experienced by the shamans, often related to powerful and reveredjungle creatures like the jaguar, as well as the ubiquitous serpent. TheseTukanoan shamans also experience imagery related to their particular brand ofcosmology, which is known and fostered by all members of the tribe. An analysisof the varied pieces of artwork inspired by their psychedelic visionaryexperiences reveals a striking commonality, for the Indians invariably portraythe spiritual entities encountered in the same way and in the same style. Thisclearly testifies to the culture-bound nature of their visions; that is, theyexperience one particular kind of visionary dialogue with the Other.From the perspective of the informational approach being taken here, suchculturally determined visionary dialogues still result from informationintegration within the psychedelically altered brain, with the attendant factthat the information used in the visionary communication derives, in part, fromthe shamans’ personal store of knowledge. Because these native South Americansshare the same culture and experience the same environmental forces, certainsymbols and images will be highly significant to them in a way that an outsiderwould not be able to fully understand. It appears then that, in common withspoken language, there exist regional “visionary dialects” expressed in thepsychedelic state, the dialect being determined by the tribe’s unique physicaland cultural environment.Claudio Naranjo, a researcher who spent many years investigating the shamanicuse of ayahuasca in the Amazon, reached a similar conclusion about thecommonality of the shamans’ visions. Naranjo wrote of visionary symbols asfollows:The superimposition of the reptile, the feline’s fangs and claws and the bird’swings (as well as the fish’s watery environment and scales) results in the imageof the dragon [synonymous with the mythical serpent]. Furthermore, through anexamination of dragon myths and the content of subjects’ reports, I concludedthat the consciousness stimulated by ayahuasca involved an intuition of theinseparability of life and death, an apprehension of life as a self-consumingand self-devouring living-into-death or dying-into-life—and observed that justas mythical dragons may be symbols of good and evil, ayahuasca animals may beterrifying or friendly according to the readiness of the psyche to acceptlife-death or to reject, not only the “internal animal” but a greater Life,along with its deadliness and mortality.2 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts31]Whether Naranjo is wholly correct in his particular interpretation is notimportant. The point is that this kind of interpretation, in which the visionaryelements are considered to be symbols replete with meaning, matches thetheoretical approach being taken here. Visionary symbols can be understood asderiving from the forced confluence of vast amounts of information. In my ownexperience, psilocybin visions are accompanied by the unmistakeable sensationthat huge amounts of psychological information are indeed being forced to fold,merge, and cohere and, moreover, that this process of forced coalescence mimicsover a brief period of time what Nature at large is doing over a long period oftime. In each case, self-organization is involved—whether of information ormatter and/or energy.It really is as if individual films of the utmost sophistication are forged bythe Other and are forcibly screened before the mind’s eye while one is in thepsilocybinetic state. The visions well up magically from the depths of thepsyche as though woven out of some undulating multicolored dream fabric, as ifone’s visual cortex were directly interfaced with some megapowerful intentionalcomputer. Obscure items from memory are often strung together in some newcreative fashion, or perhaps one witnesses scenes never before encountered butthat are nevertheless immediately understood. In either case, the visions fairlyburst with an overwhelming amount of information.The material basis from which such designer visions are fashioned is one’s storeof memories and personal knowledge of the world. According to my interpretation,the Other is able to re-form idiosyncratic information in order to communicatein a highly personal way that one would likely be responsive to. Such creativeartistry represents the meta-language spoken by the Other, the visionsrepresenting a higher, more informationally rich symbolic language beingconducted deep within the innermost sanctums of the psyche. That which needs tobe shown is shown. That which is poised to fall into place does fall into place.Information in the brain is like some living thing.Stretching CredulityIf this is starting to sound too far-fetched, it is only because the terminologyis new. What I am calling the Other is a dynamic information-integration processbrought to life within the psilocybin-infused brain. To put it another way, theOther can be understood as an information-patterning phenomenon thatspontaneously emerges when certain dynamic neurochemical conditions prevail, inthe same way that a vortex pattern may spontaneously emerge in water if certaindynamic conditions prevail. The Other appears to be a higher, more integratedmanifestation of the human psyche, so full of profundity and purposeful importthat it can be considered to be fully autonomous and dissociated from theindividual self or ego.It is hard not to believe this when one has come to directly experiencepsilocybin visions. Think of the minister from Harvard’s Good Friday Experimentwho had profoundly religious visions of Christ. This is the way in which theOther “spoke” or “introduced itself” to him. Its language is that of symbols andimages, creatively juxtaposed to convey some vibrant meaning. In the depths ofthe minister’s psyche neuronal informational patterns of incredible complexityarose, informing him in a soulful way. Those particular arrangements ofpsychological information were generated out of the informational stores of hisown personal psyche in a style that would be highly meaningful to him inparticular.The Other thus represents a name, or label, for the kind of informationprocessing underlying the visionary state. An apparent communion with the Otherdemonstrates the inherent property of neuronal information to purposefullyorganize itself into streams of ideas laden with profound meaning. If one canconceive of the mind as being a kind of informational process, one can equallyenvisage the Other as being an informational process. Whatever the actualneuronal firing mechanisms involved, it seems likely that the self-organization,or forced coherence, of immense amounts of information underlies the feltpresence of the Other.The greater the facilitation of informational organization and informationalcoherence, the richer in meaning the resulting patterns will be. In a way, it issomewhat analogous to running a defragmentation program on a computer, wherebydisconnected but related data are collated and organized in a more integratedway. In a brain/mind system under the influence of psilocybin, such adefragmentation process leads to the formation of mythical symbols and iconsbecause this is the only way in which massive amounts of related information canbe visually expressed. Because there must be limited ways in which huge amountsof information can be integrated—in other words, there are logicalconstraints—then this again explains the existence of universal symbology anduniversal mythology.But why exactly should the focused embracing of large amounts of psychologicalinformation be under logical constraints? Could not any old image or icon do?Not really. Think of some short story and imagine trying to sum up the theme inone sentence or in a single visual image, the moral of the story so to speak.Although there may be a thousand and one ways of telling that story, toconcentrate the moral (the point or overall pattern that connects the elementsof the story) into one meaningful sentence or one meaningful image automaticallyconstrains us to use certain key words or certain pictorial icons.Consider also what it is like when one searches for a word that one knows willexpress what one wants to convey; that frustrating . . . what is it called? Ahyes, that tip-of-the-tongue moment. The word or term we look for is a logicalconsequence of what we need to express, and we might well be constrained intousing that one word to capture the exact meaning we wish to communicate.Likewise, in the language of the Other, there are certain types of meaning(large patterns of information) that can be expressed only with specific symbolsand icons. The symbols and visual representations are highly organized fields ofinformation. Such symbols and their drawing together into coherent progressingvisions therefore reflect the ongoing language being “uttered” by the higherinformation-organizing processes of the Other.We can also refer back to R. Gordon Wasson’s vision of a mythical beast drawinga chariot or of the colossal doors opening. These are obviously powerful symbolsteeming with inherent meaning, especially when perceived as close as ispossible—that is, directly behind closed eyes while under the superconsciousspell of the mushroom. These visions are not like simple pretty pictures; theyare more like a confrontation with ideas and symbols issuing from some highlyorganized source of intentionality—like, say, the Platonic realm of pure Ideas,an inference you will recall that Wasson himself made in his attempts to come toterms with his experiences. The thing is, this Platonic realm, if that is whatone chooses to call the transcendental Other, is not static, like an archivalsystem. Instead, it is able to inform one through a dynamic stream ofintentional information in which visual symbology dominates.Various types of symbol can therefore be considered elements of a higherlanguage, a language not of the individual ego-driven mind but of thecommunicating Other. The symbols are amalgamated concentrations of informationcoming to life in a mind illuminated by visionary alkaloids. Or, to use Huxley’sterminology, the informational forms are transmitted via the psilocybineticbrain. As voluminous torrents of information “struggle” to integrate andcoalesce, evermore elaborate forms and patterns emerge, and these areexperienced as the felt presence of the Other actively communicating in alanguage of potent symbolic visual imagery. Information appears as if alive andintent on self-organization.The Many Guises of the OtherAs Terence McKenna repeatedly pointed out, it is quite common, for Westerners atany rate, to perceive UFO or extraterrestrial motifs in psychedelic visions.McKenna has suggested that the UFO is the Other in the guise of a contemporarysymbol. According to McKenna, the Other is normally so remote from us that itdons the mask of the UFO in order to express itself, its Otherness.Since the 1950s, a plethora of sci-fi films have focused on alien visitations toEarth. The predominant theme in these sorts of entertaining fantasy is theincredible impact that an alien presence would have on humanity. It is a modernreworking of the ancient religious idea of divine intervention. Some greatalienesque force suddenly erupts in the midst of our culture in a way thatupsets, or radically alters, human destiny. Everyone would have to take notice.People would, willy-nilly, be forced to cease their everyday business for aspontaneous alien-inspired holiday or two. Everything would have to change.Alien visitations are dramatic. They negate everything else.Obviously, then, the UFO can be understood as a modern icon, an immenselypowerful Western symbol packed with meaning. It also highlights the way to thinkabout information, for, in terms of information, the archetypal UFO is thecenter of a whole web of psychological relations and associations. It embodies aconcentration of information. It expresses a powerful set of psychologicalassociations. As a simple word, UFO embodies information in the context of theEnglish language, whereas as something visibly beheld in an entheogenic vision,the UFO, or indeed any kind of image of advanced alien technology, represents anutterance in the symbolic language of the communicating Other.In The Archaic Revival, McKenna spoke of the UFO as:An autonomous psychic entity that has slipped from the control of the ego andapproaches laden with the “Otherness” of the unconscious. As one looks into itone beholds oneself, one’s world information field, all deployed in a strange,distant, almost transhumanly cool way, which links it to the myth of theextraterrestrial. The extraterrestrial is the human Oversoul in its general andparticular expression on the planet.3 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts32]Here may lie the explanation for the rampant and often far-fetched stories ofactual UFO sightings and alien encounters not reserved to closed-eyes visions.Perhaps for some people the Other emerges into the perceived world of externalreality, although this would more than likely represent a genuine hallucination.McKenna’s use of the term Oversoul is yet another way of referring to the Other.Whereas McKenna readily assumed the Other to be the creative source of sacredvisions, I am being more specific by asserting that an experience of the Otherresults from an inherent property of information just as the individual mindresults from an inherent property of information. Through the redemptive actionof sacramental alkaloids like psilocybin, the Other is able to become manifestand flow through the neuronal architecture of the brain. The Other, or Oversoul,is information, or at least it is the creative organizing principle underlyingbrain-based information integration and brain-based information patterning. Itslanguage is that of symbols and cultural images, futuristically alien orotherwise.To sum up the far-reaching speculations presented thus far: whether personal oruniversal, information becomes incorporated into entheogenic visions in a noveland creative way such that a definite message or meaning is conveyed, or atleast appears to be conveyed. The resulting overwhelming confrontation with aspiritual intelligence is the result of information integration to the pointwhere the integrative process appears to be alive, purposeful, and distinct fromthe self or ego. This is the transcendental Other, a sentient informative entitythat is not us but something very closely related to us.Can, or Should, We Banish the Other?Alternatively, a cool, restrained, and skeptical approach might be to suggestthat the self-organizing patterning of neuronal information does not reflect aninformation-composed Other at all, but is just the result of some incidentalproperty of information. Just as gravity is a property of the Universe actingeverywhere (on a macroscopic scale) to draw physical material together, so toomight there be some inherent but incidental property of psychological material(or neuronal information) that acts to organize it. Although this organizationalprocess can, if boosted by psilocybin or endogenous brain chemicals like DMT,result in the perception of a communicating Other, this Other will in fact bejust a kind of illusory side effect promoted by the experience.Having said that, however, in terms of the visionary shamanic experience, it isclearly so powerful and so emotionally charged that the inference of atranscendental Other is historically well established and seems indicative thatsomething important and hitherto unknown to psychological science is occurring.As many Westerners who have sampled entheogenic flora will readily attest (thisincludes those brave anthropologists who have taken Amazonian psychedelic brewsand experienced numinous visions), it is not simply “primitive” inference orhearsay that has led native shamans to speak of a perceived contact with gods orspirits. It is rather the case that the sacred nature of the entheogenicexperience appears so dramatic, so persuasive, that the inference of an Otherbecomes unavoidable.Even if we did still opt for the restrained armchair-bound explanation, it isnot incompatible with the notion of the Other, but merely a kind of cleveravoidance and reluctance to invoke a “big idea” that we are not accustomed to.For to reduce the Other to merely an incidental organizing principle inherent ininformation, with no real purpose, is like saying that normal consciousness ismerely an incidental neuronal effect without any real purpose. But since we knowthat normal consciousness is purposeful (we have will, more or less), then it istenable that the Other represents a kind of purposeful will above and beyondthat of the individual ego. Indeed, if we also consider the many otherself-organizing properties of the Universe—which are deemed fundamental—then theOther might well represent a similarly fundamental aspect of Nature, one that“comes alive” when conditions in the human cortex are appropriate.Yet, if pushed, is it really necessary to speak of a dissociated communicatingpresence when a less fanciful explanation will at least partially suffice?Aren’t we in danger of becoming overtly religious by invoking a kind ofsuperintelligence dissociated from the individual self? Maybe so. But if thenotion of an intentional Other still seems too bizarre to the critical reader,the idea can be further defended by examining a common analogous situation inwhich we infer a non-self-based other. After all, do we not all assume withoutany doubt whatsoever that other conscious minds really exist? And yet this isalso a big inference based solely on subjective experience. Let us pursue this,because it is, strangely enough, relevant to the validity of inferringpurposeful entities.Big O, Little oTo posit a transcendental communicating Other is really no different to thetacit inference that other human minds exist. Both these sorts of other, the bigO and the little o, are equally conceived of as the focus points of intentionalinformation processing. Yet there might not be other conscious minds apart fromour own. Or there might be just a few. We cannot absolutely prove that otherspossess conscious minds like our own since we have access only to their externalmanifestations. Other people may in fact be, god forbid, soulless automata, nomore than mechanical zombies masquerading as conscious beings. For all you know,you might be the only conscious entity existing, for what conscious experienceare you familiar with but your own? Indeed, when Descartes began hisphilosophical career, he wanted to know what he could be absolutely certainabout, with no room for doubt whatsoever. Gazing out of an ornateseventeenth-century window, he wondered if perhaps all of reality was acunningly designed trick played on him by some artful demon with infinite powersof trickery. Entertaining such a sinister scenario, Descartes came to theconclusion that the only thing that he knew to be real for sure was theexistence of his own self—he thought, therefore he was. There could be nodoubting that at least. This deceptively simple realization became the bedrockon which much of his subsequent philosophy and science were based.The philosophical belief that only one’s own self really exists is known assolipsism. As weird as it might sound, it is a theoretical stance that manymight be tempted to adopt, even for the sake of just playing with the idea inorder to annoy and confuse friends. The point of raising this issue is that allof us make a big leap of faith in accepting that other minds like our own reallydo exist, and this way of thinking “works,” so much so that most people have notthe faintest idea what solipsism is and never even come to entertain the ideadespite it being an essentially reasonable piece of personal philosophy.Directly analogous with our tacit assumption that other conscious minds like ourown exist is the inference that an intelligent, communicating Other lies at theheart of shamanic visions. This seems unavoidable if one is experiencingpowerful visionary effects from entheogenic agents, and this makes it a validand workable way of explaining the experience despite its distinct tone ofgrandeur. I would therefore claim that the notion of a transcendental Other isreasonable in light of the remarkably integrative information processingoccurring in the entheogenimbued brain. Such chemically inspired modification ofneuronal activity is experienced as being so rich in symbology and meaning thatfor all intents and purposes it can be considered the result of a living,intelligent, and communicating agency made of information, an agency whoseintent can become activated and focused should the chemical conditions of thehuman cortex be so conducive. Information must indeed be in some sense alive.“Dreamformation”A similar process to that outlined above would appear to govern dreaming, sincecomplex and often fantastically stylized dream scenarios are something ourdreaming selves confront. We literally find ourselves witness to the integrativeinformation processes of our dreaming minds, often experiencing strange andelaborately scripted dream scenarios. But, and this is a major caveat, withdreams our dream self is not generally in a very consciously attentive state, sodreams remain ethereal and forgettable, unlike psilocybin visions, which one ishighly conscious of and which are faithfully retained within memory.It has been speculated that the reason we are unable to retain dream experienceis because the normal neuronal mechanisms that underlie long-term memory areshut off during the dream state. This, however, is not the case withpsilocybinetic visions, since the neuronal systems that facilitate long-termmemory are still operative. Psilocybin is therefore able, perhaps, to bypassthose brain mechanisms that normally serve to stop us consciously attending toinformation arising from the creative depths of the psyche.The neuropsychologist and expert on sleep processes J. Allan Hobson hasdeveloped a model of dreaming that is compatible with theinformation-integration model outlined in this chapter. Hobson has offered an“activation synthesis” model of dreaming. He reached his theoretical conclusionsafter having studied in depth the neurochemical processes underlying REM sleep(also known as dream sleep), processes that include, of course, the cessation ofthe serotonergic raphe system.On his activation-synthesis model, Hobson writes:Activation is an energy concept: in REM sleep [dreaming], brain circuitsunderlying consciousness are switched on. Synthesis is an information concept:dream cognition is distinctive because the brain synthesizes a dream plot bycombining information from sources entirely internal to itself and becausechemical changes radically alter the way information is processed. So the term“synthesis” implies both fabricated (made up) and integrated (fitted together).4[../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts33]Basically, then, dreams are associated with periodical bursts of firing inperhaps billions of neurons, with, of course, the attendant potential for anincomprehensibly large amount of networked communication (we should bear in mindthat dreaming might be due in part to endogenous DMT). This wealth of activityis integrated in such a way that dreams emerge or are synthesized. Dreams arethus constructed of information, the information concerned being embodied in theunusual global firing state of the brain.As we have already established, a related process appears to take hold whenpsilocybin is present within the brain. This “waking dream” situation takesplace during the eyes-shut waking state, whereas dreaming takes place duringsleep. So although the psychedelic visionary state and the dream state takeplace while the brain is in a different overall state (an awake state versus asleep state), the general principle of vision generation and dream generation isthe same in each case. To reiterate, this principle consists of the patterningand cohesion of vast bursts of neuronal information being generated frominternal sources and not from external sources. The advantage of “waking dreams”induced by entheogenic alkaloids over normal dreams is that in the former oneremains highly alert and highly conscious of the visionary dialogue, and it isgenerally not forgotten. Entheogenic visions also tend to be more sacred incharacter than dreams.The Varieties of Dream ExperienceOften dreams appear to be quite mundane, containing perhaps integrated scraps ofinformation subconsciously perceived during the waking state. By joining thesedisparate pieces of information, a kind of learning might be facilitated.Indeed, it has been demonstrated that if rats (please excuse the ratomorphism)are selectively denied periods of REM sleep, then they are more likely to forgetinformation previously learned.Lazy newborn infants spend about sixteen hours a day asleep, of which half thattime is spent in REM sleep. This means that they dream about three times as muchas adults. As newborns have a strong need to learn about the world, dreamingpresumably facilitates certain types of information integration—and hencelearning. Through dreams, information acquired through waking perceptions can besifted, consolidated, organized, and generally “worked out,” so to speak. Inshort, one theoretical approach to understanding dreaming has it that dreamingallows information to become integrated within the developing psyche, a viewfully compatible with my own speculations.What of dreams not obviously connected with, say, diverse pieces of information,but that concern big themes? Especially those really vivid dreams that leave alingering emotional impact on us? These might seem definitely to contain somemeaning important to our inner wellbeing. Although we in the West do not have acultural tradition that takes dreams, whether the mundane variety or the movingvariety, too seriously, this has not always been the case with our species. Itis presumably the phenomenon of significant-seeming dreams that led cultureslike native Amerindians and Australian aborigines to take dreams seriously—somuch so that dreams would often be discussed and acted on by the whole tribe.Such types of informative dream also led Western thinkers like Jung to conceiveof a collective unconscious from which archetypal dream symbols could emerge.Although Jung’s vision of a collective unconscious might be considered fanciful,it does highlight the fact that certain dreams can act as a source of usefulinformation should we choose to contemplate them. Indeed, if this were not thecase, then presumably native cultures would never have bothered with dreamanalysis in the first place.Considering these properties of dreams, we can see more clearly how the brain isliterally an information-organizing device able to continually forgeillustrative patterns of meaning both consciously and unconsciously. The onlyreal difference between dreams and psychedelic visions would appear to be theextent and scale of this important process. If information integration isallowed to reach a certain threshold of activation through the catalytic agencyof entheogenic compounds, then the ultimate source of the information-patterningprocess can be divined and we come to directly experience a symbolic andunmuddied dialogue with the Other, where the Other is precisely theself-organizing property of the information embodied in the neuronal firingactivity. In this sense the Other is a latent form of information that canpotentially be brought to life through the processing mechanisms hard-wiredwithin the brain. Neuronal information, by shaping itself in constrained ways,allows definite motifs to emerge, representative of the symbolic language of thetranscendental Other. This language is activated and perceived during both thelucid dream state and the psilocybin-induced psychedelic state. Both states arenatural and both derive from the capacity of the brain to coalesce and organizelarge amounts of information.Reality ExpansionFrom what has been discussed thus far concerning the psilocybin experience, itmight seem as if the eyes-shut visionary state is the prime effect, yet witheyes open one encounters equal perceptual wonders. The world appears as if new,bursting with a significance and beauty that literally brushes one’s soul. Onesees more clearly than one could imagine, as if an occluding cloud had beengraciously dispelled to reveal the sheer unadulterated “isness” of reality.Visual perception is experienced as though it were the finest graincinematography able to pick up upon a luxury of detail previously hidden.Objects in the environment may appear to be interconnected and part of a fluidcoherent pattern. Great thoughts occur to one, unbidden yet full of profoundimport, as if the very secrets of existence were suddenly in one’s grasp. Thisis the very least that can be stated. How can such phenomenology be accountedfor in our information-integration model?Regarding psilocybin’s radical enhancement of visual perception, it seemslogical to surmise that a change in the functioning of serotonergic systemsfacilitates a greater “absorption” of the external information impinging uponthe eyes. More information inherent in light flows through the visual system andinto the brain, and this is experienced as breathtaking visual clarity. Since wehumans are effectively embedded in an ocean of photic information, by subtlyaltering brain chemistry we can allow a tidal influx of this informational seaof light to sweep over the visual system, leaving us awash in perceptual data.All objects, whether organic or inorganic, possess an intrinsic meaning or setof relations to other objects. They possess informational content, linked asthey are to a network of relations with other objects. As discussed earlier, tosee an object is not merely to apprehend its shape or color, but to access itsmeaning. After all, the retina of the eye only records an invertedtwo-dimensional pattern of light intensities, much as computer vision recordsarrays of light intensity values. This is not seeing. Real seeing, as we knowit, involves the perception of what the object signifies. To see an object is toperceive, all at once, its role, function, and relations—that is, itsmeaning—within a vast network of objects.Under the spell of psilocybin, I suggest that one is able to penetrate deeperinto the informational content of objects, akin perhaps to accessing a higherdimension that is otherwise occluded. This is a bit like looking up a word in adictionary and noting all its meanings, thus coming to understand the word inits fullest sense. Normally we might not perceive the entire meaning of a word,accessing maybe only a fraction of its true semantic content, yet, in theory atleast, we might come to ascertain more. This is what psilocybin perceptioninvolves: the accessing of latent information normally hidden to us by thehardwired constraints of the brain (my comparison to the comprehension of wordsis useful as, in the next chapter, I hope to show further how “material” objectsin various domains—like the domains of physics, chemistry, and biology—arethemselves elements within a hierarchy of language-like systems, playingfunctional roles just like words).Informative DialoguesAs to the wealth of revelatory thoughts and ideas that erupt into consciousnessduring psychedelic ecstasy, these would appear to be, as with visions, amanifestation of the Other, in that they represent the holistic patterning ofneuron-mediated information. This may often be experienced as a kind of internaldialogue with a wise being. Profound thoughts take on a rapidly flowing life oftheir own, generating further thoughts and insights. It is impossible not toonce more invoke language here as a conceptual explanatory tool, though thistype of inner psychedelic language involving complex thoughts and ideation worksfar more efficiently than the language system of the spoken word. Everydaylanguage appears sluggish and cumbersome in contrast to the language ofpsychedelic contemplation, which moves at a profoundly different pace. Indeed,the sheer fluency and dramatic insightfulness of psychedelic contemplationexplains its emotional impact and ineffability.If we conceive of language in whatever mode as a communicatory informationsystem, we can see that its modes are many and varied, all operating atdifferent speeds and with different properties. The principle however is thesame. There is a flow of information and a natural progression that yieldsfurther information, just as with spoken dialogue. When we communicate with oneanother in conventional language, whether written or spoken, we initiate adialogue in which information is exchanged. Regardless of whether this dialogueis one-sided or not, the process is dynamic in that information flows from onesystem to another, from one person to another, from one brain to another, fromone mind to another.With psychedelic contemplation, an internal dialogue ensues in which a flow ofideas takes place between the self and the Other, where the Other is adissociated or higher-level informational source acting as one component in thedialogue process. Through psilocybin’s activating influence, the psyche becomesa conduit to the Other, facilitating a dialogue of thought in which radicalknowledge is received. It’s an incredible idea to be sure, yet, as I hope I havemade clear, the psilocybin experience demands these kinds of incredibleexplanation.image [../Images/9781594779374_003.jpg]We are now equipped with a model that views consciousness as a particularpattern of information embodied in the rapidly flowing electrochemical state ofthe brain. And we also have an informational entity that we can call the Otherthat is activated and brought to life after the ingestion of psychedelicalkaloids like psilocybin. Both consciousness and the Other can be betterunderstood as processes (or verbs) as opposed to things, moreover processesinvolving the patterning, or focusing, or coalescing, or orchestration, of vastamounts of information.Now we must turn to the nature of information itself. In particular, we shalllook at information outside of the brain and see if it too can be understood inthe same way. Does an informational language underlie Nature itself? Canmolecules and atoms be interpreted as informational elements in a molecular orphysical language? Is everything made of information? If so, does the realityprocess ultimately consist of a flow of self-organizing language-likeinformation? Did our man Einstein emerge out of, grow up in, become famous in,and eventually die in an essentially informational reality process? Read on,then, for my psilocybin mushroom tale has hardly even begun. Information, itseems, cannot be stopped."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/9781594779374_002.jpg]S E V E NA Universe of InformationNature’s entheogenic agents have provided compelling evidence for the followingtwo most interesting of propositions: first, that consciousness is a form ofinformation substantiated within the brain’s neuronal firing activity and,second, that this kind of cerebral information has a tendency to organize andintegrate itself. Evidence in support of the first proposition was provided bylooking at the ways that consciousness becomes altered according to subtlechanges in brain chemistry, especially changes occurring at synapses. Chemicallyinduced changes to global states of neuronal firing are synonymous with changesin consciousness, and since global states of neuronal firing must be globalstates of information (what else could they be?) we can conclude thatconsciousness is a form of information.Evidence to support the second proposition—that cerebral information has atendency to organize itself—came from an examination of psychedelicphenomenology and even dreaming, both processes highlighting the way thatpsychological information organizes itself without a deliberate effort on ourpart. Which is to say that we can find ourselves experiencing sacred visionsafter ingesting entheogenic agents or likewise find ourselves experiencingelaborate dream scenarios while we sleep (perhaps mediated by endogenous DMT).The former experience, the psychedelic visionary state, seems to represent avery extreme manifestation of informational organization, so much so that athird proposition suggests itself, namely that an intelligent Other, distinctfrom the ego or self, lies behind the sacred thrust of psychedelicphenomenology. Such a dissociated Other can be considered to represent anorganized source of intentional information that becomes activated when anindividual’s neuronal system is infused with psychedelic alkaloids. We can thusconcur with Huxley in his assertion that psychedelics allow a greater amount ofwhat he called Mind at Large to flow into conscious perception. The Mind atLarge is the Other, which potentially interfaces with the human psyche,revealing itself in the visionary experience and possibly during symbolicdreams. Information is the stuff of both the Other and the human mind. Consciousexperience is information in process, as is the entheogenic experience. Thegreater the field of information being processed or integrated, the moreconscious we may become (the word consciousness means “knowing together”).In all three propositions, it is most definitely the term information that fitsthe picture. This chapter attempts to formally elucidate this information-basedscenario and to explore further the nature of information and its role in theUniverse at large.Consciousness, Information, and RealityAt first blush, it might seem somewhat off the point to delve into the nature ofinformation and its role in shaping the Universe. Are we not entering territoryfar removed from tangible entheogenic plants and fungi? Won’t we be speculatingbeyond the call of duty? Can we really justify an attempt to understand of whatthe mystical experience and the Universe at large are made? Are they not twodifferent things, two completely separate domains of inquiry?In defense of such a bold move, I would remind the reader that the issue atstake in all refined psychedelic debates is that of the nature of perceivedreality, in particular, whether the seemingly expanded field of reality unveiledby psilocybin, with its spiritual aura and its mysterious feel ofinterconnectedness, has any kind of firm foundation. My conviction, like that ofHuxley and McKenna, is that entheogens like psilocybin really do allow us toglimpse the “bigger picture” (which falls into place when neuronal conditionsare conducive) and that an attempt to understand this “bigger picture” should bepursued as far as possible. Since the psilocybin experience seems to depend onextreme levels of information integration, this strongly suggests, at least inmy mind, that a principle of self-organization operates throughout the Universeon all levels, from star formation to DNA formation to the formation of minds,concepts, and perceived truth. In any case, the idea that the Universe consistsof a purposeful flow of self-organizing information is precisely what visionaryagents like the mushroom seem to confirm. For this reason, I think an attempt tounderstand reality in terms of information is justified. However, before we goon to examine these issues, a brief detour is in order. This will serve to drivehome the point that entheogens have an important role to play in our conceptionsof reality.Shifting ParadigmsA genuinely mystical experience in which the presence of the Other is feltcannot fail but change one’s conception of the world and, in particular, thesignificance one gives to life, particularly conscious human life, on thissensitive planet of ours. It therefore comes as no surprise that psilocybinphenomenology can be a tad religious in nature. Because the entire field ofreality (the “bigger picture”) is reconceived and reperceived in thepsilocybinetic state, a kind of subjective paradigm shift occurs somewhat akinto paradigm shifts in science. These shifts in theoretical perspective involvethoroughly new conceptual frameworks with which to comprehend the fundamentalnature of things. Similarly, traditional religious ideologies attempt to providean overall scheme with which to understand reality. It is this holistic natureof religious thought that links it with psychedelic thought.Entheogens, then, are powerful tools with which to forge a new set ofconceptions about the reality process, and any competent person out to grasp themeaning of life should consider employing them. More to the point, newlyacquired concepts can continue to be employed long after the consumedpsychedelic catalysts have been metabolized into inactive by-products. In asense, it is as if new conceptual insights into Nature, once divined, installthemselves permanently within the mind. Entheogenic ecstasy, once tasted, is notforgotten. The difficulty, the overwhelming labor, is in trying to integrate thenew view of reality with the old, to merge them so to speak, which is preciselywhat the rest of this book is about.Huxley epitomized the paradigm-shifting effect of psychedelics through hisinterests and concerns during the last decade of his life. As we have seen,Huxley was convinced that psychedelics could grant one access to the sacred sideof Nature as encountered by mystics and religious visionaries, an aspect ofreality real but hidden to the secular mind. Indeed, he even asked his wife toinject him with LSD shortly before he died, so assured was he that a psychedelicstate of mind could prepare him to face the final stage of human life. This israther dramatic testimony to the fact that psychedelic consciousness connectsone to the deepest mysteries that reality confronts us with.Similarly, in the context of traditional psychedelic shamanism as practiced inSouth America, the mythological conception of reality held by the whole tribestems from the effects of entheogenic plants on the psyche of the shamanicvoyager. And, as the acid gurus of the 1960s testified, worldviews are very muchat stake when it comes to the use of psychedelics. Chemically instigate a changein an individual’s underlying concepts about reality, and culture transformsitself also.In each of the above cases, reality is the issue at stake, along with theimportance of the psychedelic experience in shaping it. Even without apsychedelic experience, Nature demands that we perceive it in some kind oforganized way. Since we are woven into the very fabric of the Universe, wecannot ignore its true nature forever. Perhaps, for the most part, we conceivethe nature of reality unconsciously, for we all carry around tacit assumptionsand tacit beliefs about the world (this book, for example, carries a number ofbasic assumptions, such as the assumption that a “world out there” really doesexist and that its nature really can be understood). Like our consciousness, wetake many things for granted and may hardly ever reflect on them (like thestable existence of beneficent energy-emitting suns, for example, or the stablepresence of oxygen in the atmosphere). What makes psilocybin so remarkable isits uncanny ability to take one’s precious store of reality concepts and shakethem about vigorously so as to reveal just how fragile and shallow-rooted theseingrained beliefs might be. If we imagine normal consciousness to be like agramophone needle trundling along the groove of Nature’s apparent “surface,”entheogens like psilocybin can jog the needle of consciousness into a rarer, andindeed, more “groovy” surface groove. The true nature of reality then becomes akind of “unfinished business” that simply must be dealt with. This is theclarion call of the psilocybin mushroom advocate. If we really wish tounderstand the reality process and the sense and significance of human lifewithin it, entheogens offer us a direct path to the Other, a sentient andintentional agency made of information whose presence and teachings await us.Assessing the Reality SituationOne cannot stop reality, and this makes its nature formidable regardless of whatyou believe. The sun warms us or burns us. The cold of winter bites at ourflesh, and our homeostatic bodies automatically respond by shivering. Therelentless rush of our billion-cell biology propels us toward sex, always itseems, making us grope, cling, moan, and shudder. This same biological marchalso puts us to sleep every night. We awaken, and again there it is—the realityprocess. We are inescapably bound up in it like grains of sand caught in aneverlasting vortex of wind. More to the point, eventually this perennialcondition kills us.As I remarked in the introduction to this book, whatever you may have read, theultimate nature of the reality process remains open to question. This may alwaysbe the case. Science seems always to reveal more mystery as it delves into theheart of “matter.” What is more, science is conducted first and foremost togather data. How this data is interpreted is another matter. What is a complexmechanical system to one scientist might be blatant proof of an organizingintelligence to another. And as for the long-sought-after supertheory that willbe able to explain the totality of Nature in terms of, say, umpteen dimensionalsuperstrings or in terms of some convoluted mathematical equation that only afew ivory-tower professors can really understand, these are likely to omit anexplanation for consciousness and the mysteries of the mind. Indeed, such afinal theory, such a final equation scrawled on a blackboard with one fell swoopof chalk, will probably serve only to confuse the average mind rather thanenlighten it.It seems apparent that if we open ourselves to the vast cosmic mystery ofexistence, then we could do a lot worse than pursue the implications of thepsilocybin experience. To consume the sacred mushroom is to launch oneselfwholeheartedly into the mystery of being, the mystery of our short existencewithin this big system we call Nature. Our lives are defined by our consciousexperience. We are led, prompted, and coaxed according to how we are informed.The remarkable feature of psilocybin mushrooms is that they can inform us inways profound and sublime. To ignore their effects is to ignore new perspectiveson reality.As it is, the nature of the Universe is defined by the prevailing conceptualsystems built into one’s culture. In our case, the predominately reductive andmaterialistic paradigm favored by most of the science community shapes our viewsabout reality. In the traditional scientific outlook that permeates Westerneducational institutions and the media, there is no real room for any kind oftranscendental aspect to Nature. Nature is there, Nature is eminentlyintelligible, we can learn how it works, and that’s really all there is to it.Suggesting that Nature has a spiritual dimension or an intentional quality isanathema to most scientists.The entheogen advocate will doubtless have a stereotypical image of a hardnosedreductive scientist. It will be a he, and he will be old, scary, and grim faced,always waving a dry finger of admonishment at any talk of a so-called sentientand intentional Other. If psilocybin visions cannot be empirically measured inthe lab, then forget it, he will say. And if one points to the few scientificexperiments that have attempted to quantify the psychedelic experience in someway, our gloomy specter will doubtless pick holes in the methodology and ask formore proof. He would maintain that these experiences are simply too subjectiveand too personal to base any objective claims about reality on.Still, as I hope I have demonstrated, psychedelic phenomenology flies in theface of claims that Nature lacks a spiritual side, or at least the psilocybinexperience offers what I believe to be the most compelling reason to grantNature an intent of some kind. This appears to be a neat and valid side stepwith which to bypass the bleak presence of the reductive materialist. Indeed,the real possibility that the reality process has a fantastically benign andpurposefully smart aspect becomes readily apparent through psilocybin. Such apossibility will become ever more clear in this chapter and those that follow.In short, psilocybin represents a catalytic agent of change in the domain ofperceived reality, and this is why we shall now pursue the implications raisedby the information-based propositions stated at the outset of this chapter. Weare now armed and ready to re-view the “bigger picture” in the light of thepsilocybin experience. This will prove to be astounding, so hold tight.Elucidating the Nature of InformationWhat does it really mean to say that consciousness is a form of information? Weseem to have merely replaced the intangibility of consciousness with anotherabstract entity. The question then arises as to what exactly information is. Buteven if we do succeed in adequately defining information, will we not then be indanger of trapping ourselves into one of those infinite regresses ofterminology? Hopefully not. What we really want is a conceptual notion ofinformation, not just another term. What I wish to develop is a broadunderstanding of what information is, and, in particular, whether it can be usedto describe the world of so-called “matter” as well as that of mind. If so, thenreality will have revealed itself to be made of different forms of information,almost as if . . . well, we shall see.Information is notoriously difficult to get a handle on. The “slippery eel” thatwas consciousness has now become the “slipperiest eel” that is information.Apart from my hopefully reasonable assertion that consciousness is a form ofinformation, it would also appear that much else besides consists ofinformation. It seems to be everywhere, all over the place in fact, yet itdefies a simple all-encompassing formulation. I am reminded here of the cult1960s British TV series The Prisoner in which protagonist Patrick McGoohan,number 6, asks his mysterious captors what they want of him. “We want . . .information . . . IN . . . FOR . . . MATION!” he is repeatedly told. Perhaps heshould have asked them to carefully define it. Anyhow, whatever it was, theynever got it. Let’s hope we fare better.Someone once compared the modern status of information to that of iron in theIron Age. The fashioning of iron lay at the heart of Iron Age material culture,yet no one knew of iron’s atomic structure, that its useful nature lay in itsatomic configuration relative to other matter. Similarly, we live in anInformation Age, yet, if pressed, we find it difficult to get at the nature ofinformation, at what exactly it is that links all forms of information, whetherthis information be in the form of consciousness, a bar code, a book, a weatherfront, or the current positions of the planets.There are, in fact, specific ways to measure specific types of information.These were developed in the 1940s and 1950s by communication engineers who wereconcerned with the efficient transmission of signals along media like telephonelines. But before we look at the way they conceived information, let’s firstexamine the commonsense view of what information means to us in its ordinarynontechnical sense. Since we use the term all the time, especially in ourpresent culture, this must signify that we do know something intrinsic about itsnature.Take the following three deliberately evocative examples in which information isinvolved. They are not as trivial as they might at first appear; rather, theyenable us to focus more clearly on the nature of information.Example number one: At the end of the esteemed gangster movie Miller’s Crossing,the main character shoots a fellow gangster but makes it look as though he wasshot by someone else. He does this by putting the gun involved in the hands ofyet another gangster, who lies shot and dead, so that it looks like the twogangsters shot each other dead at the same time. Now, when he plants his gun,our miscreant fails to wipe off his fingerprints. Why? Maybe he was unaware ofthe science of fingerprinting that was likely not as advanced and as pronouncedin the 1920s (when the film is set) as it is today. In any case, the man simplyplaces his gun in the other’s hand. We know, of course, that had a modernforensic expert been around at the time, they would only have had to test thegun for prints for the real villain to become apparent. And what is thesignificance of said fingerprints? No one would doubt me if I said that thefingerprints contained information.Example number two: A nervous student armed only with a fountain pen and a smallbottle of ink enters an examination hall and takes an exam. After completing theexam the relieved student leaves, carrying his pen and his ink bottle, which isnow empty. The ink he has left back in the examination hall is carefullydistributed over the various sheets of the exam paper, and the distributionalpattern of ink will, ultimately, decide whether he passes or fails the exam.Clearly, the pattern of ink set forth by the student contains a wealth ofinformation.Example number three: You crack open a boiled egg for breakfast. As you dip yourtoast into the yolk, you begin to reflect upon the nature of this tasty sourceof protein. In particular, you realize that if this egg were fertilized and hadnot been removed from beneath the warm body of the hen that laid it, then itwould eventually have developed into a full-grown chicken with wings, a visualsystem, an innate repertoire of behavior, a digestive system, and so on. Inother words, you become aware of the astonishing fact that somewhere within thesoft yellow substance of an egg there must reside an inconceivably large amountof information.Potential Information and Active InformationThe first point to make about these three examples is that the informationinferred is in a potential, or latent, state, which is to say that the unseenfingerprints remain as potential information until perceived; the distributionof ink across the exam paper remains potential information until the paper isread by an examiner; and an egg, before its untimely removal from beneath a hen,is also rich in potential information.The second point is that this potential information can become active providedthat it comes under the effects of an appropriate environment or appropriatecontext. As you will recall from chapter 5, I mentioned contextual environmentsin connection with their effect of providing meaning to individual neuronalpatterns. We can now use this concept of context in a more general sense inorder to understand how information can be made to actively flow or unfold froma potential state. As we shall see, context is an incredibly important word.In the fingerprint case, a forensic expert armed with the tools of the trade cancome to draw out the information embodied in the prints. The expert causes theinformation inherent in the fingerprint patterns to flow out into the largerenvironment, such that the information causes things to happen. The informationhas gone from a latent, passive state into an active state by virtue of thecontextual effect of the forensic expert’s psyche and equipment (that is, theexpert’s mind and equipment operate as a context). In other words, anappropriate contextual environment allows the meaning inherent in the prints tobecome manifest. To highlight the scope for causal effect that a transitionalflow of information can have, we should note that information in fingerprinttraces can penetrate a courtroom and induce a conviction. Information is apowerful thing, able to spread itself out into the greater environment.With the distributed ink example, its analysis by an exam grader causes thepotential information to flow out and be actively informative so that it comesto shape the grade awarded to the student. In the context of the psyche of anexaminer, the information inherent in the precisely patterned distribution ofink is significant enough to indicate the intellectual capacity andcommunicational intent of the student.As for the egg, its informational content similarly undergoes transition from apotential state to an active state when an appropriate environment draws theinformation out. In this case, a specific temperature acts as the initialbefitting contextual environment, serving to elicit a flow of information fromthe sequential DNA patterns in the yolk (within the nucleus to be precise). Denythe egg the appropriate temperature context (take it away from warmth) and theinformation remains potential and inactive; hence a chicken fails to develop.Subjective and Objective Patterns of InformationBesides the distinction between potential information and actively flowinginformation, there is also a distinction to be made between subjectiveinformation and objective information. In the case of the fingerprints and theink distribution, the information is activated by us. The appropriate context isthe subjective attention of human observers who come to channel the information.This means that the information is purely subjective in nature and depends onhuman observation to activate it. In fact, this subjective nature of informationholds for the majority of the things we usually conceive of as information inour culture, things like TV and radio broadcasts, books, memos, newspapers, andso forth. To the fly crawling over the TV screen or the pages of a book, thevisual or written information remains potential and dormant (unless of coursethe fly happens to be a cunningly designed electronic CIA bug), whereas in thecontext of the observing human psyche, the information actively flows out ofthese media and comes to be causally influential. It should be stressed howeverthat this subjective nature of the information does not lessen it in any way; itis still very much a real part of the Universe. Relatively speaking, all and anykind of information is real.The case is somewhat different with the egg, for human observers are notnecessary to elicit the (genetic) information that they carry. The informationin an egg is usually “read out” by the natural environment, and we can refer toan egg’s information as being objective in the sense that the objective naturalenvironment is involved as the appropriate context eliciting the process ofinformation flow. The same goes for seeds and spores. They are informationalentities that release their stored information when the natural environment isin a specific state. If the seeds or spores fall on “stony” ground (the wrongcontext), then their information remains unread, dormant perhaps for years.Indeed, a rather dramatic and apt example of this process occurred in the caseof a freeze-dried Neolithic hunter found in the Alps a few decades ago. When hisnondesigner straw footwear was thawed out, some fungal spores in the ancientstraw came to life and grew. Scientists were astonished, as it was the firsttime that such a turn of events had been observed. Cryogenically suspended forfive thousand years, the fungal spores went suddenly from a passive to an activestate due to the warm environmental context of the science lab. The informationin the spores began to actively flow, and this process manifested in theelaborate growth of the fungus.But in both subjective and objective information, what is it that comes to flow?What is actually happening when the fingerprints are analyzed, when the ink isread, and when eggs and spores begin to grow? It is obvious that some kind offlowing process occurs wherein potential information becomes active information.But what exactly does this flowing process involve?The Flow of InformationAbove all, when information flows, there appears to be movement and change, inparticular, a change in the state of at least one of the systems involved. Inanalyzing fingerprints, the information they contain initially affects theoverall state of the forensic expert’s psyche (the psyche being a system).Through analyzing the prints, the psyche of the forensic expert is provided withknowledge, a term often associated with information. Indeed, the concept ofknowledge is bound with the theory of information developed by communicationengineers, for information is conceived by them as representing a reduction inuncertainty. The richer the transfer of information, the less uncertain aboutsomething is the recipient of the information—hence more knowledge is gained. IfI ask you to think of some famous person, and I try to guess who you thought ofthrough the Twenty Questions game, then if my first question is whether theperson is male and you answer “yes,” then that single bit of information hashalved my uncertainty. For the communication engineer, information is correlatedwith knowledge and a reduction in uncertainty regarding a choice ofpossibilities. Actively flowing information therefore comes to reduce the numberin an ensemble of possibilities. It reduces uncertain possibilities and givesrise to the actual. The net result is a definite change, or resolution of manypossibilities into one certainty, in the receiving system involved in theinformation flow. An uncertain “open pattern” becomes a certain “closed pattern”as it were. In the fingerprint case the receiving system is the psyche of theforensic analyst that changes its state, or at least part of its pattern,according to how it is informed.Regarding the examiner case, before he or she comes to mark the paper, there iscomplete uncertainty about the ability of the student. As the exam paper isread, the information flow gradually causes a reduction in uncertainty, until aneventual mark is settled upon. So, akin to the previous example, we can see thatthe information contained in the patterned distribution of ink gradually changesthe state of the examiner’s mind or psyche. It is this sort of process thatwould appear to lie at the heart of subjective information transfer. A system ofinformation on one level, or in one domain, connects to another system ofinformation such that the state of the receiving system becomes altered. Or, toput it another way, one pattern of information is able to effect changes inanother pattern of information. The human psyche is precisely a type ofinformational system, or informational pattern, able to change its stateaccording to information coming from those other systems in which it issensorially embedded.It is apparent then that subjective information, when accessed through reading,hearing, smelling, tasting, seeing, or touching, comes to change the form of thereceiving system substantiated in the receiver’s brain. If we imagine thebrain’s neuronal system to be like clay, then as patterns of information impingeupon this clay, the shape of the clay is altered, and thus there has been a flowof information. The impact of the incoming flow of information leads to agradual change in the form, or formal state, of the clay. The actual system thatfunctions like clay is the neuronal system, or, to be more specific, the way inwhich billions of neurons are connected to one another. Indeed, learning, and bydefinition information access, is thought to be mediated through changes inneuronal connections. It is the overall network of connections that reflects theglobal form, or “shape,” of the neuronal system.The dictionary definition of information helps us here too, for it tells us thatinformation comes from the Latin word informare, which means “to give form to.”When information informs us, it alters the form, or pattern, of theinformational system that is our mind. The mind is therefore aninformation-based system constantly re-forming itself (changing its pattern)through the accessing of information deriving from other kinds ofinformation-based media, just as if it were clay being shaped by itsenvironment.For us, there is only information. Our minds are uniquely enduring patterns madeof it. Information from other patterns, or systems, is continually beingabsorbed, integrated, and given out again. In this process, the form of the mindchanges through alterations in the ways neurons are connected to one another.Consciousness emerges as a complex pattern of information whose form isconstantly undergoing dynamic change due to the integration and accessing ofother types of information through the senses. This is what I mean when I talkabout the flow of information.DNA InformationThe case of the egg is somewhat different. When environmental conditions areconducive, the objective information in the DNA becomes active and is expressedthrough biochemical activity. DNA is seemingly “tuned” to operate when aspecific environmental context surrounds it, just as our minds are tuned to ournative language. The precise molecular details of DNA need not concern us here;rather, we need only grasp the general principle of how information activelyflows out from DNA.In our discussions of the egg, DNA represents “matter in a significant state”such that given a certain environment complex, organic activity will unfold.From a single fertilized egg cell an entire organism will develop because theinformation in the egg cell’s DNA becomes activated. The DNA causes particularamino acids to form, which then cause various proteins to form, and hencevarious organs are assembled. Morphogenesis, the growth in form of an organism,is thus the reading out of DNA information, the expression of the meaninginherent in DNA (incidentally, if an egg is eaten, then another form of itsinformation is accessed; in this case its “nutritional information” is absorbedby the consumer).DNA information is read out through biochemical processes, and the resultingchange in the formal state of the overall system itself acts as a contextualenvironment that allows the growth, or information readout, to progress. We canview the immediate chemical environment of the DNA as being both on thereceiving end of the information transfer and able to feed back on, andinfluence, the information being accessed from the DNA. The form of the DNA, itsspecific information-rich pattern, comes to govern the form of the developingcells within which the DNA is embedded. In turn, the form of the cells (that is,their relative distribution as they multiply) will determine the formaldevelopment of the organs within which the cells are embedded as well asdetermine further DNA translation. In this way, DNA information comes to flowoutward and be expressed on a macroscopic scale.There is a strong suggestion here that informational systems (that is,meaningful patterns of form embodied within different media) are embedded withinone another as in a nested hierarchical continuum and that they are continuallyinfluencing one another’s form. This is rather dramatically illustrated in thefact that the reading out of DNA eventually leads to an organism moving about inthe world at large. If some mutated DNA has fortunately produced some newadvantageous behavior, then this eventually feeds back on the mutated DNA andfavors its chances of being preserved. In a similar fashion, the form of thehuman genome is a direct consequence of the form of the environment in which ourancestors evolved. Thus, organisms and environment represent one continuousdynamic fluidic system. Informational systems, such as DNA, cells, organs,organisms, minds, and environments, are like the nested layers of an onion,intimately embedded within one another and able to inform (put form into) oneanother. All are interrelated states, systems, and patterns of information.Information and LanguageSince DNA is clearly a form of information, we can dispense with calling it“matter in a significant state.” DNA is information in the same way that wordsare information or a string of Morse code is information. Both DNA and wordscontain meaning, potential or otherwise, which can be read and which can inform.DNA is thus a biological informational language that is expressed throughbiological growth and biological activity. I would go further and suggest thatthis language-like informational process is not merely a metaphor for spoken andwritten language, but that DNA really is linguistic in nature with its owngrammar and semantics, albeit of an organic kind. If the DNA is disorganized inany way, then this corresponds to faulty grammar, and the development of theorganism will proceed in a defective way. Consider the disease sickle-cellanemia, in which red blood cells are misshapen (they are shaped like a sickle).It is caused by just one faulty microscopic link in the DNA, yet this singleerror is enough to produce the disease. The faulty DNA link can be viewed as agrammatical error that interferes with the meaningful expression of the DNA.The language-like processes so far suggested lead us to another concept, that ofa dialogue. If we envision a dialogue as a communicatory process in whichinformation is transmitted, then subjective information like the written orspoken word flows according to a dialogue between the source of information andthe recipient. Imagine someone talking on a phone with no one on the receivingend. No dialogue and hence no communication of information takes place becausethere is no one to provide a receptive context—no one is there to be informed.However, if someone does take the call, then the information from the sendercomes to be absorbed by the recipient, that is, there is a definite informationflow between psyches. The form of the neuronal “clay” of the receiver is alteredby the patterns of information being conveyed through the phone. The subsequentdialogue might be a one-sided affair in which the receiver merely listens, or itmight be two-sided, in which case both parties are involved in the informationflow. In either case, the dialogue facilitates a flow of information that leadsto a qualitative change in the informational state, or formal state, of thereceiver’s mind.If we now consider biological systems once more, a similar kind of informationaldialogue takes place, this time between the organism (with its DNA) and thenatural environment. Think of any plant as it grows. At the very tip of theplant, the leading edge of the growth process so to speak, there will be newlyemerging cells. This unfolding growth will take place within the context of thenatural conditions encountered, such as luminosity, temperature, humidity,gravitational force, and so on. A whole host of influential factors both insideand outside the plant will play an interactive role in shaping the form of thegrowing tissue. I suggest that this interactive process represents a kind ofnatural dialogue (as opposed to a dialogue in conventional spoken language)whereby information embodied in the plant comes to be provoked and stimulatedinto action by the immediate environment.The resulting plant forms, in this view, are no less than natural, ongoing,organic “utterances,” or expressions, shaped in response to the surroundingenvironmental context. The key point is that the interaction of the plant withthe environment can be described in terms of a dialogue-like, language-likeprocess of information flow. There are no rigid boundaries at all; rather, thereexists a hierarchy of informational systems in which patterns and structuresconstantly flow and influence one another. Information is everywhere, residingin systems as diverse as biology and the human psyche. All systems can be viewedas patterns, or architectures, of information embedded within one another.Further, when one pattern influences the form of another, the process appears tobe remarkably language-like.Dissolving Matter into Forms of InformationBut what of inorganic matter? Can we stretch the language-like informationalparadigm to cover entities like physical elements? We should not forget thatatoms underlie the various informational systems we have been discussing. If wetake the most basic element, hydrogen, I see no reason why we should notconsider it to be akin, in computer terminology, to a localized “byte” ofinformation, divisible into even smaller “bits” (each byte in a computer’smemory consists of a string of eight elementary digital on-or-off bits). Whatmakes an element of hydrogen different from, say, an element of iron is itsatomic configuration. The structural form of hydrogen (its pattern) is such thatit bears specific systematic relations to other elements. Here again, we arriveat an informational and language-like conception of hydrogen. It is an atomicexpression, a “word unit” in the language of physics. Put hydrogen in thecontext of another element, like oxygen, and their relational properties causethe formation of water molecules. Or, put an atom of hydrogen in the context ofa star, and another aspect of its information becomes apparent, in this case itsability to undergo nuclear fusion. A star thus evokes one particular kind ofinformation embodied within hydrogen, a fact of no small import for theexistence of life on Earth.An atom of hydrogen can therefore be understood as being a localization of basicinformation, an element within the most primal language of the Universe. Withthis view, the basic “matter” of the Universe starts to dissolve, and instead wesee only information. All elements—from argon to gold to zinc—are here inferredto be units of information whose informational substance differs according tothe relational role they play in a language of elements. This is theinformational language of physics, as opposed to the informational language of,say, biochemistry, genetics, or psychology.To gain a perspective on the sheer expressive capacity of the language system ofelements, one has only to think of all the countless ways in which basicelements like hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, phosphorous, magnesium, and nitrogen cancombine, yielding such varied forms as DNA, methane, ammonia, psilocybin, sugar,chlorophyll, amino acids, proteins, and so on. This implies that the language ofphysics underlies the language of chemistry, which further underlies thelanguage of biology. Once more, one can divine that all these languages ofNature are part of an interconnected continuum wrought of information and withinwhich the various kinds of information are everywhere flowing.When we come to the various particles of which atoms themselves are made(protons, neutrons, and electrons), we are confronted by still more basic unitsof information, akin to on-off computer bits or the individual letters that makeup words. The following relevant quotation on the nature of elementary particlescomes from physicist and philosopher Fritjof Capra, who, through his examinationof quantum physics, has also concluded that the classical Newtonian view ofparticles as being “material stuff ” is no longer tenable. In The Tao ofPhysics, Capra writes:The high-energy scattering experiments of the past decades have shown us thedynamic and ever-changing nature of the particle world in the most striking way.Matter has appeared in these experiments as completely mutable. All particlescan be transmuted into other particles; they can be created from energy and canvanish into energy. In this world, classical concepts like ‘elementaryparticle’, ‘material substance’ or ‘isolated object’, have lost their meaning;the whole universe appears as a dynamic web of inseparable energy patterns.1[../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts34]Such a Universe of weblike energy patterns is entirely compatible with thelanguage-like informational model being developed here. As stated, a languagesystem like English consists of discrete informational elements (words) thatderive their meaning from their relationship to things in the world and, moreimportant perhaps, the specific functional role they play within a system of(words). If we take a French word like bon, we see that it plays the samefunctional role within the French language as does the word good in the Englishlanguage. The word good is the point where a set of informational relationsconverge, and since all languages contain similar informational relations, theycan be translated into one another.Words can therefore be understood as being formal units of information that,when joined together, create further patterns of information. This also holdstrue for units of information like particles and atoms. They derive theirmeaning from their relations with other particles and atoms and, like words,they can form together to create an endless amount of new patterns orexpressions.The same principle applies to the languages of chemistry, biochemistry, andgenetics. In each of these language-like systems, the elements involved beardefinite relations to one another, and the relations determine the nature andmeaning of each element. Although each particular language-like system operateson a different scale and uses a different kind of logic, all interpenetrate oneanother, and all foster the continual flow of information.The Universe can now be understood as a kind of ongoing dialogue, or story even,in which language-like patterns of information are forever in the process ofinforming one another. As this universal tide of information flows, merges,folds, knits, weaves, and feeds back on itself, novel patterns of informationare continually being stimulated and declared into existence. Particles, atoms,elements, molecules, cells, microorganisms, plants, animals, humans, minds,ideas, and so on—all are forms of information continually in process. Any“thing” or object is where a vast set of relations converge, and, ultimately,all these sets of relations form a coherent interconnected whole. Nothing isisolated; everything is relationally connected to, and defined by, everythingelse. Patterns within patterns within patterns. Whether potential or active,information is everywhere. Nature is made of it, fundamentally so.Regarding this informational approach to understanding Nature, George Johnsonintroduces the same paradigm as championed by the Santa Fe Institute in his bookFire in the Mind. The scientists at the Santa Fe Institute study complexity (inall of its incarnations), and some are convinced that information is afundamental property of Nature. Johnson reports on one of their typicalconferences:Most of us are used to thinking of information as secondary, not fundamental,something that is made from matter and energy. . . . But to many of those at theSanta Fe conference, the world just didn’t make sense unless information wasadmitted into the pantheon, on an equal footing with mass and energy. A few wentso far as to argue that information may be the most fundamental of all; thatmass and energy could somehow be derived from information.2[../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts35]A Contextual Web of InformationAs the reader can appreciate, a number of key words help elucidate the newinformational paradigm, words like context, system, web, and pattern. All thesewords infer interconnectivity, that all forms of information impinge upon oneanother such that no one thing can be fully understood in isolation.Consider the following phenomenon that precisely highlights the contextual webof information uniting all and sundry within Nature, namely the formation of asnowflake in the atmosphere. An individual snowflake’s particular developmentand form is dependent on a contextual web of informing relations (temperature,air pressure, and so forth) that ultimately extend out into the entire Universe.Because each snowflake bears a unique set of contextual relations to the rest ofthe world, each snowflake develops a unique form. This is amazing but true.Similarly, every structure, object, or “thing” is an informational entity thatachieves its meaning and significance according to its language-like role withinthe context of the rest of the Universe—language-like because, as with words,objects play a well-defined role within a language-like system.Consciousness as a particular form of information can now be discerned withstriking clarity. Any particular conscious state, as it flows, is determined byall the informing relations converging in the neuronal system at that moment.These relations will be the unconscious systems of the mind along with theenvironment that surrounds the individual. This contextual network of informingrelations determines what the neuronal activity means. The brain/mind systemexists in relation to the immediate surroundings, society, culture, the planet,and the rest of the Universe, and it is this network of relations converging inthe brain that determines the state of consciousness. Furthermore, to consumepsilocybin mushrooms is to allow a new set of informational relations toconverge within the neuronal brain. Thus, one may suddenly “mean” more inrelation to the rest of the reality process. Regarding consciousness, this isperhaps the most that can be gleaned from our informational model at this point.So far, I have deliberately avoided putting the term process before the terminformation. Instead, I have repeatedly spoken of a flow of information inprocess. Everything—the entire substance of Nature—consists of information, andeverywhere this information is in process—flowing, merging, coalescing, andinforming in a language-like way. If we switch the terms information and processaround, we unavoidably face yet another extraordinary idea, that in some sensethe Universe must be a kind of computation, for computation involves theprocessing of information. That the Universe is akin to a vast computation (oreven a simulation) is a notion currently voiced by a number of prominentscientists, and it is worth exploring in more detail as it might bolster theidea that reality is a system of self-organizing language-like information. Justwhen you thought it was safe to take a well-earned breather, we encounter yetmore profundity."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/9781594779374_002.jpg]E I G H TDoes the Universe Compute?Before we try on the Universe-as-a-computation notion for size, let us brieflyacquaint ourselves with the number-crunching background that provided us withcomputer systems in the first place. We are not so much interested in thedetails of computer hardware but rather the essential informational principlesgoverning the operation of computers. This will reveal more about informationand the way different forms of information can be processed. We will then beable to see if a computational description really is suitable for Nature (thisis not as offensive as it might at first seem to some). If Nature can indeed beunderstood in computational terms—and I hasten to add that I am not the first toput forward this idea—we would have to view ourselves as living programs writtenin an organic, biochemical language. More to the point, we would representprograms whose destiny is to be twice executed—first by way of geneticallydetermined growth and second by inexorable death.In the meantime, of course, before the latter eventuality, we can, through theconsumption of certain “access codes,” come to experience information pertainingto the point or purpose of the overall master plan governing the realityprocess. Once more, it sounds assuredly fantastic, yet if the computationalparadigm is in any way accurate in describing what Nature is about, then suchradical ideas as these will have to be accepted or at least be debated. Anyhow,to get you in the mood to swallow the idea of an information-processingUniverse, let us briefly look at the rise of computer culture, for, whateveryour opinion of computers, these “infomous” machines are guaranteed to run andrun. . . .The Computer RevolutionIt was the emergence of information-processing computers in the 1940s thatheralded the arrival of the Information Age. Before 1950 there were just fifteendigital computers in the world, probably because there was no room for any more,given their huge bulk in those days. Now, of course, computers have shrunk insize and are pretty much a compulsory possession. Indeed, our culture thrives oncomputers, which explains the exponential growth in computer technology, thatis, that computer science is evolving ever more rapidly. Trade and industry, themilitary, our education systems, financial institutions—all now depend on theconstant processing and manipulation of information carried out by versatilecomputers. Information is the supreme currency of modern culture; it iseverywhere being fed in and out of computer systems.As with information and information integration in general, the emergence ofcomputer systems and the proliferation of global computerized telecommunicationsystems like the Internet seem unstoppable. It is difficult to discern whetheranyone has any real control over this development. So fast is computertechnology racing that before we can assess the implications of one aspect ofit, another dramatic breakthrough is made. Nostalgically recall the chunkyportable digital calculators that suddenly appeared in the mid-1970s. At thetime, these computing devices seemed excitingly futuristic. Whether or not theywere understood, their various buttons and computational functions seemed toprovide an instant gateway to esoteric mathematical knowledge. Input a fewnumbers and commands, and the little machine instantly responded as if by magic.Log books and slide rules could at last be ceremoniously trashed. And yetsmaller mass-produced digital calculators are now given away in cereal packets.Similarly, those original home computers of the early 1980s, like the cuterubber-key Sinclair ZX Spectrum (with a whopping 48K memory!), are now all butworthless and primitive (in terms of capacity) in comparison with today’slightweight, high-resolution, portable touchscreen variety. And by tomorrow eventhese will have become passé. The digital computer revolution is happening sofast that it’s a blur.Formal SystemsComputers are popular because they are able to process information quickly andin so many different ways. Processing information, information in process—it’sthe same thing. At heart, information processing is all that computers do,whether the computer in question is used by the Pentagon, the Inland Revenue, orme to write this book. Computers might process musical forms of information,financial forms, meteorological forms, or even viral forms. Whatever the form,computers can be fed only with information, which they promptly process andreturn to the user.As it is the form, or “shape,” of the information that is processed bycomputers, a computer is an example of a formal system. When it comes down tothe nitty-gritty, all a computer does is take one formal set of symbols (aninformational pattern), which means nothing to it, and translates that set ofsymbols into another form according to specific rules. Likewise, the output ofsymbols (an informational pattern) means nothing to the computer either. Thecomputers we employ only slavishly manipulate symbols; they do not think, theyknow not what they do.In general, formal systems like a computer consist of a set of processableformulas such as strings of elements or symbols taken from some well-definedalphabet. In a computer the strings involved are sequences of binarynumbers—ones and zeros—which are known as machine language. Any information canin principle be coded into binary strings. Think about it. Recall in the lastchapter my contention that matter is informational. As we shall see, it isprecisely because physical systems can be transcribed into digital bit strings(that is, physical systems are informational) that has allowed computers tomodel aspects of the world. Add to these bit strings (whatever they mightrepresent) a set of transformation rules that govern the ways the binary stringscan be transformed, and you end up with a formal system able to processinformation. The more powerful the computer, the more rapidly it can deal withits binary manipulations.The transformation rules operating in a computer system are embodied in thecomputer’s software, which is run by the computer’s central processing unit (theCPU). The software instructs the CPU how to operate on its input information ina specified way. Built into the CPU are numerous logic gates (like AND, OR, andNOT gates) that transform sequential inputs of ones and zeros into furthersequences of ones and zeros according to how input is fed into the CPU. Millionsof such transformations occur each second, and the resulting output states(further strings of ones and zeros) can then be interpreted from outside thesystem. In other words, the context of human perception is needed to inject somemeaning into the computer’s output. For example, a computer system might takesome input from a keyboard, process it according to its program, and thendisplay the words Are you sure you want to exit this program? on the computer’smonitor. Although the pixel array might well say this, for the computer it ismerely a particular pattern of binary output absolutely determined by thelogical processing of the input.Other formal systems are things like dreaded algebra and heavy propositionallogic (input All sensible men hate propositional logic and Aristotle was asensible man, and according to the transformation rules of propositional logic,the output must read Aristotle hated propositional logic).Chess is a more common kind of formal system. In chess, the pieces are theindividual symbols and the strings are the possible positions of those pieces.The game proceeds according to transitions of the initial state, whereby theinitial configuration, or initial start pattern, changes into anotherconfiguration through the movements of the chess pieces. This is the sameprinciple involved with computers, as they too work by processing informationvia transitions of an initial input state. Thus, the rules of chess represent akind of software that dictates how state transitions are to proceed.The transition from one state of an ongoing chess game to another is discrete,as with the operation of any formal system. A bishop does not half move;instead, it “jumps” from one position to another. Also, since a formal systemlike chess depends solely on the form of the symbols and strings relative to oneanother, it is irrelevant what the pieces are made of. Indeed, they need noteven be “physical” at all, for most professional chess players are able to playthe game in their heads alone. Though that will not do much for avid spectatorsof chess, it does highlight the fact that a formal system can be realized inmany different types of medium. Indeed, a computer system can be made of old tincans and bits of string. The crucial aspect is the way the system’s symbolsrelate to one another, regardless of the medium.You could even take some people and use them to represent in binary code twonumbers that you would like to multiply. Roughly symbolizing genital structure,the women could represent the number zero and the men the number one. After thetwo numbers have been transformed into a binary queue of men and women, onecould multiply the two numbers by channeling the queue through a few logic gatesoperated by a couple of friends (instead of telling the binary people queue togo forth and multiply . . .). You could then take the output queue (the newpattern) and interpret the resulting encoded number, which, if you set up thesystem correctly, would correspond to the multiplication of the two originalnumbers. Agreed, a calculator app on a cell phone could have done the job moreefficiently and with much less hassle, yet the point is that the calculator appitself works on the same principle, only it uses memory bits to embody thebinary information. Formal systems like computers are therefore not tied to anyparticular substantiation.Formal Systems and LanguageBefore we alighted on the notion of formal systems, I argued that not only wasthe Universe made of information, but that this information moved or flowed in alanguage-like way. I claimed that the elements in informational systems like DNAuttered their informative content in response to specific contexts, as ifnatural dialogues were unfolding. We have now reached the point where we candefine language, in whatever mode, as a formal, and hence informational, system.Let me quote writer Paul Young, author of The Nature of Information:All languages are form dependent. In spoken language, arbitrarily selectedsymbols are manipulated as units that can be interconnected or arranged only inspecific relationships according to specific rules. It is the form (relations),whether semantic, syntactic, experiential, or contextual, of the elements oflanguage, and not the matter of which they are constructed, from which the mindgenerates meaning; the physical symbols themselves embody no linguistic meaning.. . . It is neither the mass nor the energy content of the letters, words,sentences, and so on, whether expressed via mouth, pen and ink, stylus and wax,or computer printout, that contains the information in language, but theirspecific form or arrangement.1 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts36]I have gone one theoretical leap farther, however. Young refers to the so-called“matter of which they are constructed” with regard to the symbols of language.This “matter,” in my view, is itself composed of language-like elements withinsome formal system or another. This implies that there is only information; theUniverse is built on formal informational systems like those of physics,chemistry, and biology, and all are embedded within one another to form anintegrated continuum. They are formal systems because it is the form (that is,the pattern) of the elements, whether they are particles, atoms, molecules, orwords, and their formal relations to one another that determine the role,meaning, and subsequent behavior of those elements.The language-like system of particles represents the Universe’s most basicinformational substrate. This system begets the language-like system of atomicelements. In turn, this system gives rise to the language-like system ofchemistry, which itself leads to the language-like system of DNA. And so onright up to the substantiation of the language system of consciousness withinour biological brains. Each language-like system of information utilizes its ownkind of logic to express itself, namely the logic of physics, the logic ofchemistry, molecular logic, the logic of genetics, bio-logic and, finally, thelogic that underpins cognition. Each kind of logic gives rise to patterns thatinfluence one another and that lead to more patterns, some of which produce, orcome to embody, new systems of logic. Descartes was wrong; the dualistic mind/body problem is an illusion. Formal systems consisting of language-likeinformation constitute reality. Information in process is everywhere andeverything.Some Inside Information: Are We Output?If the above reasoning is correct, the Universe must in a real sense be anongoing computation in which its information content is being continuallychurned and processed so as to yield new forms and/or patterns of information.At any one moment the Universe is in a specific state or form. This state isprocessed according to the “rules of the Universe,” and another universal stateis formed. And so on, from the moment of the alleged big bang to right now. Theentire Universe can thus be considered a progressive state transitionalcomputation, a kind of metaformal system continually expressing its creativepotential. And, more profoundly, we are inside the computation. Or so it seems.Is such speculation tenable? Could we really be locked inside a vast Matrix-likecomputation as though we were all but hapless subroutine prisoners, moving intime to some grand algorithmic dance? According to our foray into the nature ofinformation and computational procedures, the suggestion that the Universe is akind of computation would appear to be a spectacular probability, albeit atrifle claustrophobic, and an outrageous absurdity at the same time. We are soused to thinking of computers as neat boxes atop desks that we forget that theyare formal systems that can, in principle, be embodied in anything. But, if wedo take this fact into account, and if we also bear in mind that computers canmanipulate all sorts of information, even going as far as simulating things likethe solar system, then we might well be attracted to the idea of a computationalUniverse. Or am I merely resorting to the use of a convenient metaphor borrowedfrom our technological culture? If so, the metaphor might be useful but,ultimately, since it is temporal, its use will be limited until another, moreuseful metaphor becomes available.Whereas it is true to say that metaphors have often been taken from the latesttechnological advances in order to support some novel theoretical conjecture, Iwould reverse the argument. I hold that the principle of informationalcomputation reflects the actual way (or at least one way) in which Nature itselfoperates. What we have achieved in the digital computer revolution is amimicking of Nature. We have come to realize that the name of the Universe gameis information (everything is information) and its processing according tononarbitrary rules and commands. Indeed, one has only to consider the fact thatDNA, the very mainstay of life, is itself a form of digital information to beginsuspecting that Nature is computational in some fundamental way. Four nucleotidebases make up all DNA—guanine, cytosine, adenine, and thymine—and because anygiven unit of DNA must be one of these four possibilities, then this system isclearly digital (quaternary as opposed to binary).In his book A Devil’s Chaplain, evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins driveshome this point about DNA being digital as follows:Watson/Crick genetics is digital through and through, digital to its verybackbone, the double helix itself. A genome’s size can be measured in gigabaseswith exactly the same precision as a hard drive is sized up in gigabytes. . . .Genetics today is pure information technology. This, precisely, is why anantifreeze gene can be copied from an Arctic fish and [be] pasted into atomato.2 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts37]As if this digital quality of DNA was not striking enough, neuronal firingactivity is also likely to be based on similar digital principles becauseneurons do, or do not, fire. Patterns of neuronal firing differ according towhich neurons are firing and which are not firing (as well as the rate offiring). Thus, nervous systems (which include the brain) seem to employ anessentially digital form of information processing. As much as we like to thinkof ourselves as pioneering inventors and technological geniuses, Natureevidently beat us to it in terms of digital technology and digital computation.The Information Age is far older than we imagined.State TransitionsIf the reader is still not convinced that the essential fabric of the Universeis informational or if you still much prefer the safe and reassuring feel of“hard, tangible matter,” let me introduce more support for theUniverse-as-a-computation scenario. This comes from popular science writer PaulDavies. Davies is foremost a professor of theoretical physics, yet he is one ofthat rare breed of scientist who dares to ask the really intimidating questionsabout the fundamental nature of reality. He also attempts to answer suchquestions.In his award-winning book The Mind of God, Davies labors hard to get to theheart of reality. While discussing the ability of computer simulations to mimicaspects of the real world, Davies inevitably asks us if the Universe is itselfcomputational.Compare the activity of the computer with a natural physical system—for example,a planet going around the sun. The state of the system at any instant can bespecified by giving the position and velocity of the planet. These are the inputdata. The relevant numbers can be given in binary arithmetic, as a bit string ofones and zeros. At some later time the planet will have a new position andvelocity, which can be described by another bit string: these are the outputdata. The planet has succeeded in converting one bit string into another, and istherefore in a sense a computer.3 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts38]In the same vein, Davies goes on to discuss the various states within a systemof gas molecules. An incredibly long binary sequence could be used to specifythe velocity and position of all the gas molecules at one instant. After a setamount of time has passed, a new state will have been reached that can likewisebe specified in terms of a bit string. Input information has thus been convertedby Nature into output information, and this is clearly a computational process.It is precisely because different aspects of the world can be coded into abinary form that computers are able to model different facets of reality. Ofcourse, computers are not able to simulate the real world exactly, as that wouldrequire a calculation involving all the relevant information in the system to bemodeled. Any inaccuracy in the initial configuration of input data tends toincrease exponentially as the simulation progresses (if the simulated system isnonlinear). This is the so-called butterfly effect, in which the statetransition of the system is highly sensitive to initial conditions. Alter theinitial state of a computation in some minuscule way, and the alteration willinevitably have an increasing influence on the development of the computation,so much so that the end state might be radically different. This is why computersimulations of the weather are not accurate beyond a few days and why we shouldbe merciful in our judgment of erroneous weathercasters. It is simply impossibleto input all the information about the current state of the weather. Only thereal weather system itself contains all the relevant information. Weatherscientists simply simulate the weather as accurately as they can using as muchinput information as they can obtain. Computers merely model different aspectsof the world; they cannot recreate them 100%, for that would necessitateinputting absolutely all the relevant information. For sure, computers andcomputations made by people are smart, only the real world is far grander andricher in information. And we conscious humans are part of its output.The Original SoftwareIf we go along with the notion of the Universe at large as being an ongoingcomputation, at least of sorts, we are unavoidably led to ask ourselves whatprecisely governs the state transition of the Universe from one moment to thenext? In other words, what are the rules that control this vastinformation-processing system? After all, there must be some lawful control overthe progress of the “Universal Computation,” for we witness order and cohesivepatterns on all scales of reality, from simple cells to spiral galaxies. Whatthen is the basis of the meta-grammar or meta-software that runs the realityprocess?It would appear that the fundamental laws of physics represent the UniversalComputation. These laws constitute a kind of essential software governing theongoing computation of the Universe. There can be no denial of this, for thefour fundamental laws of physics (gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong andweak nuclear forces) reign supreme throughout the Universe and provide thebedrock upon which cosmological events unfold. However, these laws ofphysics—representing perhaps the ultimate contextual rubric—have generated newinformational systems, like those of chemistry, genetics, biology, and the mind,which I outlined in the previous chapter and which I described as beinginformational systems in this chapter. These informational systems havethemselves allowed new laws to emerge. This is also undeniable. Formal systemslike genetics or the English language can in no way be totally reduced tophysics. Nor can consciousness be reduced to physics. And yet physics and thefundamental laws that govern physics have somehow encouraged these subsequentsystems to emerge.Laws are essentially grammar-like because they govern the way information flowsand integrates within different language-like informational systems. Thus, oncenew forms of information arise within the Universe, new laws emerge that controlthe relations between them; that is, new grammars come into existence. This isan important point to bear in mind when we talk of the laws of physics, for onemight be suspicious that physical law alone is sufficient to cause, say, theevolution of life. It is rather that the laws of physics have allowed new lawsto emerge once new forms of information have come into being. In this sense, thelaws of physics are primary; they are the fundamental grammar, so to speak, orfundamental pattern that facilitates all else of interest. This is somewhatreminiscent of the fundamental role of the octave in music. The octave definesmusic since it holds all the major notes within it and specifies the vibrationalrelations between those notes. Once the fundamental octave system has beenspecified, then all music, all those compositions and melodies we love, can begenerated out of that basic system. The same principle applies to chess, ofcourse. Once the rules are created, then every chess game, whether a classic, anepic, or an embarrassment, can be generated from those basic rules.We should also bear in mind that simple physical systems governed by simple lawscan nonetheless generate novel behavior. Indeed, over the last few decades chaostheory has amply demonstrated the unpredictability and surprising behavior thatcertain seemingly simple physical systems can display. So even though the lawsof physics may be understood, the long-term effects of those laws can be utterlynovel. To suggest that the Universe is computational and controlled bysoftware-like laws does not imply that the future is determined. Indeed, chaostheory teaches us that novelty and unpredictable surprise are an inherentfeature of reality.Is Reality a Bit Fishy?The laws of physics, such as they are, require an initial input state in whichto manifest themselves. This initial state would appear to be the initialconditions at the time of the alleged big bang, conditions that manycosmologists have argued had to have been highly specific in order that theUniverse evolve in the way it has. Here we face a deep mystery. Why thatparticular set of initial conditions, and why those laws of physics?In many of his books, Paul Davies (whom I quoted earlier) concludes that theUniverse appears to be a bit fishy. Davies refuses to accept that the laws ofphysics and the initial conditions just happen to have been that way. It appearstoo good to be true, especially as we are around to speculate upon it. Eitherone accepts these fundamental properties of Nature as being unexplainable “brutefacts,” or one can try to account for them in some kind of metaphysical way.As we are once more entering unusual territory, let’s quickly recap. We havebeen trying to understand reality as an ongoing computation in which all of theUniverse’s information is being relentlessly processed via countless statetransitions. This informational process has led to the (novel) formation ofgalaxies, stars, planets, life, Homo sapiens, consciousness, and subsequentlyconscious reflection on the nature of galaxies, stars, planets, life, and so on.The existence of such patterning is astonishing enough. But we have alsoconcluded that these interesting and creative outputs are entirely dependent onthe laws of Nature and the initial input conditions, and that these are specialin some way, at least special in the sense that they have produced enduringforms of information like you and me.If this line of reasoning already suggests the presence of a God of some kind,then it is because our vocabulary is severely limited when it comes todiscussing these types of issue. This is a relatively new area of thought, foronly in the last few decades have scientists begun to seriously contend with whythings are the way they are, with why the Universe appears to be somewhat fishy.These are legitimate questions to ask, although they extend well beyond thelimited scope of science.I believe that since we are inextricably caught up in the unfolding Universe,wherever it might be leading, then it is surely in our interests to confront thesituation head on. In fact, we should demand to be enlightened as to what isreally going on here. As I have made clear, natural entheogens and their abilityto foster transcendental forms of cognition are perhaps the greatest tools athand for coming to terms with these questions about reality. Create the rightsort of neurochemical alchemy, bring the right sort of natural ingredients intoplace, and information seems to conveniently orchestrate itself into revelatorypatterns of understanding. This is the method, perhaps, whereby Nature resolvesan understanding of itself through the vehicle of consciousness.However, before we go on to form a conclusion from our informational view ofthings, it will be useful here to show in more detail how the computationalprocessing of information according to a few very basic rules can nonethelessyield organized forms and structures. In particular I would like to welcome tothis chapter the extraordinary world of the cellular automaton. This is not asdull as it sounds, and since such a system is very simple to grasp, it lendsitself well to our computational/informational paradigm.The Game of LifeA cellular automaton is a classic computational-cum-informational system able toyield lifelike phenomena, and it is therefore a model that captures, at least inpart, Nature’s life-making capacity. Oddly enough, the study of these systemshas its roots in a novel Mexican mushroom, only this time the mushroom inquestion is the malignant mushroom cloud of the atomic bomb.The atomic bomb was created in the army laboratories of Los Alamos in New Mexicoas part of America’s Manhattan Project. In fact, it was in response to thecautionary word of Einstein himself that the USA originally attempted to crackthe atom for weaponry purposes. In 1939, Einstein, who was then seeking asylumin the USA, wrote to President Roosevelt concerning Germany’s widespread andzealous search for uranium. It was painfully clear to Einstein that theimplications of his E=MCÂ² equation were being followed through to theirultimately explosive end and that the USA would do well to keep abreast of thisdisturbing development. On the strength of Einstein’s warning, Americanauthorities galvanized themselves into developing an atomic bomb before Germanymanaged it, and thus the Manhattan Project was born.After the end of World War II, the Manhattan Project built a prototypicalelectronic computer system called ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator andComputer). This was the first operational, general-purpose, electronic digitalcomputer, and it was initially used to solve various ballistic calculations. Thesuccess of this “giant brain,” as the press called it, stimulated thedevelopment of other computing machines and helped pave the way for the moderncomputer industry.Computations on ENIAC were supervised at Los Alamos in part by eminentmathematician John von Neumann. Although von Neumann was a mathematical wizard,his ethical stance was a little questionable. Not only was he an extremely vocaladvocate for the total nuclear destruction of Russia before that countrydeveloped a nuclear capability, and not only did he feel that it was safe tocarry out and closely observe nuclear test explosions (he was later to die ofbone cancer, probably caused by witnessing nuclear explosions at Bikini Atoll),he even devised plans to dye the polar ice caps in order to melt them. He alsohelped design the nuclear bombs that were detonated over Japan.Despite these cheery idiosyncrasies, it was von Neumann who first began to studythe computational properties of cellular automata on the bulky computers at LosAlamos. Von Neumann had always been fascinated by the idea of self-replicatingmachines, though he believed that ultimately this was not possible using onlyvacuum tubes, transistors, and the like. However, by utilizing the new computersthat were at hand, von Neumann was able to implement a computer program in whichsimulated life-forms were able to replicate themselves. The program was theoriginal cellular automaton. That these self-replicating, computer-generatedentities were not made of flesh or machine parts did not matter, as it was theirlogical and organizational structure that defined them. This was one of thefirst real insights into the simulational power of computers. They could createconvincing forms of life.Von Neumann’s work was given a whole new lease on life (literally) by Cambridgemathematician John Conway, who in 1970 invented a cellular automaton called theGame of Life. The game is deceptively simple, yet it is able to generate anendless amount of complexity and variation. It also mirrors the computationalquality of biological life.The Game of Life is referred to as a cellular automaton because it proceedswithin a grid of cells (like graph paper) and because the game’s progression isentirely automatic. The game progresses according to four rules. These fourrules are applied again and again to the current state of the cells in the grid.Cells are either occupied or not—which means the system holds binary values.Cells are digital, on or off, alive or dead. These are the four simple rules: 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by underpopulation. 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation. 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding. 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.An initial configuration of on/off (that is, live or dead) cells is provided asinput, and then the four seemingly vacuous rules are applied. The output fromthis process yields a new configuration of on/off cells. The rules are appliedrepeatedly, hundreds or even thousands of times. The results can be striking.Not only do slightly different start configurations yield wildly differentoutputs, various patterns can form that endure throughout the game. Ifsuccessive states of the cellular automaton are presented rapidly on a computerscreen as opposed to being drawn on numerous sheets of graph paper, a Life moviecan be watched as it progresses. Patterns emerge, move around, collide, mutate,oscillate, and some even seem able to replicate themselves.Conway’s Game of Life grabbed media attention in the early 1970s throughcoverage in Scientific American. The various Life objects began to acquirenames. Shuttles, beehives, and flotillas were born. Ships, boats, barges, andblocks were readily observed and documented as they meandered about thetwo-dimensional Life plain. (Animated examples of the Game of Life along withrelevant freeware can still be found on the Internet—indeed nowadays certaininteresting configurations can be iterated billions of times in just seconds.)The genelike pattern with the capacity to replicate that sometimes emerged inthe primordial Life soup was named the glider. Gliders were observed to collidewith one another, resulting in the formation of a glider gun that shot outfurther gliders as though they were its offspring. It was even discovered thatglider guns could be set up in such a way as to constitute a virtual computer.Conway proved that processions of gliders were able to code binary numbers, andthat logic gates could be formed by making glider streams collide with oneanother in a specific way. The result is startling. The Life computer can itselfembody yet another computer, and so on ad infinitum. A digital informationprocess within a process within a process (this, of course, is reminiscent ofpatterns within patterns within patterns).The fascinating feature of the lifelike patterns that evolved in the Game ofLife was their origin. From initial simplicity, complexity was born.Furthermore, cellular automata were clearly computational, whether they wereplayed out on a computer, a chessboard, or on graph paper. Through statetransitions, information was being processed throughout the game. There was anunavoidable implication that life itself might represent a similarinformation-processing system. If so, then the Universe could most definitely beunderstood in computational terms.We have now arrived back at the Universe-as-a-computation scenario. An ongoingcomputational system, the Game of Life vividly demonstrates how initialconditions and some basic state transition rules can give rise to organizedcomplexity and the emergent phenomenon of self-replication. The realcomputational game of life in which we have been born similarly depends upon awell-defined initial state at some distant moment in the past and a set ofrules. In this case the rules are the laws of physics and the constants ofNature (like the particular strengths of the various forces of Nature). Thisimplies that we are inside the Universal Computation, much as gliders are insideof cellular automata.A Discrete Look at TimeThe case is still not watertight. Cellular automata, and indeed all computationsproceeding within a computer, move in discrete steps. If the Universe is anongoing computation, then, strictly speaking, it ought to proceed in discretestate transitions, frame by frame as it were. The late mathematician MartinGardner, who originally introduced the Game of Life to readers of ScientificAmerican, was one of the first to speculate about this. He wrote: “There is eventhe possibility that space-time itself is granular, composed of discrete units,and that the universe . . . is a cellular automaton run by an enormouscomputer.”4 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts39]In other words, if the Universe is indeed a kind of computation, there is likelyto be a smallest unit of time (time is granular) that cannot be broken downfurther. Such a hypothetical smallest unit of time is known as a chronon. Achronon is an absolute moment, or quantum of time, in which the Universe is in aparticular state. This state will then proceed by a discrete “jump” to form thenext chronon according to whatever laws are operating on that state, much likethe movement of electrons, which are supposed to discretely jump from one orbitto another. There are believed to be no intermediary states between successive“jumps.”If time does indeed move in discrete jumps, one might well ask why we experiencetime as flowing. There is no surprise here, for to talk of discrete time is liketalking of the successive frames of a movie. If the frames are presented quicklyenough, the illusion of continuity becomes apparent. An illusion of continuityis also manifest in the Game of Life. The state transitions of Life automata canbe processed by a computer so quickly as to give rise to patterns, which, on thecomputer monitor, appear to flow across the two-dimensional playing field. Infact, all computer displays move in discrete stages, even in the most advancedprograms. Popular computer games and cell phone apps might look as if they areflowing smoothly, yet in actuality they are proceeding in rapid statetransitional jumps (hence a still frame, or “RAM slice,” can be observed if acomputer game is paused).The continuous flowing forms that seem to constitute the Universe must thereforebe due to the presence of stable patterns that endure from one moment to thenext. If one were to take one snapshot slice of reality, a single,all-encompassing chronon as it were, one would not be able to properly discernany patterns; rather, the patterns we observe, like planets and people, arepatterned structures that emerge over a multiple succession of such slices.Likewise, I would assume that consciousness seems to flow precisely because itis an informational pattern that endures across successive frames of granulartime.There have been attempts to quantify the hypothetical chronon. For what it’sworth, it is assumed to be the shortest conceivable length divided by thevelocity of light. For obvious reasons, I’ll take this definition on trust.Anyhow, this yields what is sometimes called the “Planck time,” and this mayrepresent the elusive chronon. Intuitively it seems there must be discrete time,for otherwise a second could be divided into an infinity of moments. If so, thenit is hard to see how time appears to flow at all. An echo of this “timelydilemma” is found in particle physics. Are there any smallest bits, or doesscale and size continue indefinitely? It makes more sense to think of a smallestunit of matter (or information) and a smallest unit of time. The case remainsopen, however, though it is doubtful that any measuring instrument could bebuilt to observe any discrete moves in time. Alternatively, it may still bepossible to hold the computational view of the Universe with non-discrete time.This is a task someone else can tackle.What Gave Our Universe Its Lucky Break?Once more assuming that reality is indeed a kind of ongoing computation in whichlanguage-like information is everywhere being processed, and in which the moment“now” is the leading edge of the computation, we can return to the question ofits software, that is, the laws of physics that determine how the Universedevelops and progresses. As previously noted, the nature of the Universe iscompletely tied up with the laws of physics and the initial conditionsprevailing at the beginning of time. Now, just how significant or arbitrary arethese two sets of variables?With the Game of Life, Conway’s four rules were specifically designed to ensurethat enduring and interesting forms of information could arise as the gameproceeded. The four rules were chosen from what is basically an infinite amountof possible rules. Indeed, it took Conway a great deal of time to discover thesefour rules. If you took just any old rules and applied them to the game, thennothing much of interest would happen. And if anything of interest did crop up,it would only be likely to vanish soon after. It is because Conway’s Life ruleswere so permanent, precise, and constraining that his game took off and wasultimately able to yield lifelike forms. Moreover, to obtain really interestingresults (like getting a virtual computer to emerge), one must carefully engineerthe initial state, set it all up in advance so to speak, to ensure that thesystem develops in the way you wish. Conway was clearly God of the Game of Life,or at least his intelligence was. For a glider speeding merrily about the Lifeplain, it could do a lot worse than worship the great and holy Conway ofCambridge as its creator.So, what about the laws of physics and the initial conditions in the real gameof life? Just how precise do they need to be to allow us to be here now toreflect upon them? This is somewhat hard to ascertain since we know of only thisUniverse. We can’t examine other Universes with slightly different laws andinitial states to see if they also bring forth life and consciousness. However,many scientists have concluded that for conscious life as we know it to haveevolved, the laws of physics and the initial conditions had to have been exactlythe way they are. Indeed, it seems that there are many “cosmic coincidences”that have “conspired” to elicit life. In The Mind of God, for instance, PaulDavies has commented upon the combined effects of hydrogen, subatomic neutrinos,and physical law in their impact upon the emergence of organic life.It is particularly striking how processes that occur on a microscopic scale—say,in nuclear physics—seem to be fine-tuned to produce interesting and variedeffects on a much larger scale—for example, in astrophysics. Thus we find thatthe force of gravity combined with the thermodynamical and mechanical propertiesof hydrogen gas are such as to create large numbers of balls of gas. These ballsare large enough to trigger nuclear reactions, but not so large as to collapserapidly into black holes. In this way, stable stars are born.5[../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts40]Davies goes on to describe how some stars eventually explode and how the remainsof supernovas (exploding stars) form the basis of planets like the Earth.Apparently, every heavy atom in our bodies had to go through many supernovacycles before ending up as an integral part of terrestrial life. The force of anexploding star derives, in part, from the presence of neutrinos, which Daviesrefers to as “ghostly entities.”In other words, the long and complex chain of state transitions of the Universethat eventually yielded life and consciousness was determined by the precisemanner (both microscopic and macroscopic) in which the universal dialogueunfolded. An appropriate set of grammatical rules/ physical laws that wouldeventually generate life and consciousness was seemingly “set up” at the verybeginning of time. Once the laws of physics and an initial input state had beenspecified, they eventually went on to facilitate the evolution of planets andpeople made of stardust. Even dour Mr. Skeptic must concur that this has been asomewhat fortuitous turn of events. One has to be near dead not to marvel atleast a little at our conscious existence at this stage of the Universe’sevolution.Consider also the so-called constants of Nature, like the mass of the electronand Newton’s gravitational constant. Their value is considered absolutelyprecise, and they determine how the language of physics is conducted. Theseconstants also seem to be fine-tuned to allow organic life to emerge. If theirvalue was but a fraction different, then life as we know it could not exist.Some scientists have introduced the strong anthropic principle to account forthis phenomenon. This principle holds that the fundamental constants of Naturehave the value they do precisely to allow life and consciousness to developsomewhere and somewhen in the Universe. It sounds like design. Needless to say,other scientists balk at such talk, preferring to seek a less astoundingexplanation.The “life-friendly” nature of Nature is seen elsewhere. The element carbon,which is so crucial for life on Earth, is generated inside stars by anextraordinary series of “lucky flukes.” It just so happens that normally rarehigh-speed collisions of three helium nuclei are favored to occur within starsdue to fortuitous quantum effects. The resulting carbon that is formedeventually gets blasted out into space when stars go supernova. Because carbonis the basis of all organic chemistry, we really can thank our “lucky stars” forits biologically constructive presence here on Earth.Even the expansion of the Universe is precision-based so as to allow time enoughfor galaxies, planets, and life to form. If the expansion of the Universe weretoo fast, then galaxies could not form, and if the expansion were too slow, itwould recollapse before anything interesting happened. According to someestimates, if the velocity of expansion in the first second of the big bang wasa mere trillionth slower, the Universe would have collapsed within fifty millionyears, during which time the temperature would have remained above ten thousanddegrees, clearly a state unfit to yield life as we know it.And let us not forget good old water. Water is indispensable for life. Thevarious unique physical and chemical properties of water—as utilized by life insuch processes as photosynthesis, nutrient transport, osmosis, heat reductionthrough sweat evaporation, and so on—make water a form of fluidic informationfundamental to the art of living.Then there is DNA. Not only is it remarkable that something like the geneticcode was always waiting to fall into place once certain precursor events hadunfolded here on Earth, but it is equally remarkable that DNA has the specifickind of variability and mutability that it does. If it were much more subject tomutability and change, then it would not be robust enough for life to take hold;and if it were too accurate in terms of replicational fidelity, then it couldnot become subject to natural selection. As with many other creative propertiesof Nature, it seems there are specific windows of opportunity present, and it“just so happens” that DNA has all the qualities necessary for it to work.These are but a handful of the countless examples that show how finely tuned theUniverse must be to bring forth organic life. This situation echoes the preciseconditions needed in the Game of Life for cellular automata to bring forthelaborately organized forms. In both cases, the real world and the model world,it is clear that specific fundamental laws in association with specificfundamental constants and precise initial conditions are needed to ensure thatinteresting organized patterns evolve.Now, Wait Just a Goddamn Chronon!We might protest here and argue that life has merely exploited the conditionsthat happen to prevail. In that case, life has just seized on whatever “chances”are on offer, where chances is the appropriate word. Life might thereforereflect what can be achieved in an essentially uncontrived Universe. But how canwe be positive that life and consciousness could have evolved in “any old kind”of Universe? Could one just throw some dice to determine, say, the mathematicalnature of the laws of physics, and then still expect to get life andconsciousness at some stage in the resulting reality? Could one think of anynumber between 1 and 1 million, add 5, randomly shuffle the decimal point,designate this number as the value of a constant, and then still expect to comeup trumps with the subsequent Universe? Come to think of it, why should there beany laws, energy, and dimensions at all?It appears impossible to conclusively prove that an evolutionary process inwhich consciousness is eventually formed depends on our particular type ofUniverse with its particular initial conditions, physical laws, constants, andso on. And yet it is easy to imagine stupid and very silly Universes in whichnothing of interest happens. Letting our imagination go, we can pictureUniverses in which the laws of physics stop complex structures from forming orin which the constants of Nature force the Universe to form into a bland andstagnant conglomeration in which nothing creative happens. More chaotically, wecan imagine Universes with little or no law and order at all, or with just acouple of unstable dimensions. Or, even more absurdly, we can imagine a Universein which life starts, only to be inevitably destroyed soon after by someimmutable principle of physical law. There are trillions and untold zillions ofpossible boring lifeless Universes, just as there are billions and untoldzillions of possible uncreative cellular automata. So, why is our Universe sovery, very interesting? And why us?One “fast-food” solution is to suppose that the Universe expands from a big bangonly to eventually contract into a “big crunch” at some later stage. Out of abig crunch a new Universe evolves and the cycle continues, only this time thesuccessive Universe has slightly different laws and initial conditions. This“pulsation of Universes” is presumed to have been going on forever without anyreason whatsoever—an infinite chain of Universes with no end and no beginning.One of these, ours, just happens to be one of the significant ones among aliteral infinity of boring ones.A similar scenario to this is the arch-cunning multiple-Universe theory toutedby a disturbing number of quantum physicists. They view the Universe dividingwhenever a quantum event takes place in which more than one outcome is possible.This happens more than a lot. Thus, the Universe is forever branching into anendless amount of Universes. Again, we merely happen to be in one of the moreinteresting ones.Finally, there is the “birthing Universe” theory, also of appeal to somecosmologists. This imaginatively fertile scenario views black holes giving birthto new Universes with slightly different laws and constants, one of which . . .well, you know the score by now.Are the above proposals tenable in explaining our very special Universe? Onreflection, these “you want it your way, you got it” schemes are a tadridiculous, for in them there must be, by definition, not only an infinity ofUniverses but an infinity of ones like our own, differing perhaps only in someminor detail like, say, your surname. In one of this infinity of Universes, orperhaps in 582 of them, each of my readers will be called Mr. or Mrs. Banana.But, since we can never observe or experience these other Universes (apart fromin Star Trek or The Twilight Zone), then what on earth is the point of invokingthem? In other words, is it really legitimate to speak about that which cannotin any way be verified by direct experience? I think not.The popular principle of Occam’s Razor (perhaps we should now call it Occam’sLaser) holds that one should always stick to the simplest theory possiblewhenever one has to choose among competing theories. This tenet has attained akind of hallowed status within science. If we introduce it here, we see thatthere could be no more blatant departure from the use of Occam’s Razor than inan inference that a literal infinity of unobservable Universes exist. And, asDavies has pointed out, even if you do endorse one of the cunningmultiple-Universe scenarios, they all fail to explain why an infinite chain ofUniverses exists in the first place! Basically, what all of these imaginativemultiple-Universe scenarios reveal is that physicists and cosmologists are inexpletively deep water when it comes to accounting for the “why” of our mostcreative Universe. In other words, it is becoming more and more apparent thatNature is extremely fine-tuned, yet no one really wants to invoke anintelligence to account for the fine-tuning.Alternatively, some people just shrug their shoulders at the presence of lifeand consciousness in the Universe, happy to heed the Beatles and just let it be,let it be. As long as dinner is on the table and there’s a good film on TV, whocares why the reality process is so organized, coherent, and conducive toconsciousness? And as for agnostics who deny that people can acquire knowledgeabout the ultimate nature of the Universe, unless they have explored allpossible approaches to the mystery, then they are merely being lethargic, happyto shrug and shrug again at unexplainable brute facts. Alas, we have no time forsuch shruggers here.I happen to think that it is a bit of an intellectual cop-out to dismiss thefine-tuning of our Universe as being no more than a brute fact to be mindlesslyswallowed and forgotten about. It is not just that a Universe with specificlaws, dimensions, and free-flowing energy should exist in the first place (whynot dimensionless nothingness—it seems a lot more simple), and it is not justthat a Universe should endure for so long. Why should the something that doesexist be so creative and reach a state where it can contemplate itself throughthe mind of Homo sapiens? How come we ourselves are so highly attuned to themystery?Ultimately, the choice about the significance one attaches to the Universe is apersonal one. One can only mull over the facts about reality, the rules of thegame as it were, and then interpret them in the light of contemplation. One’sunique life experiences will also help shape one’s conclusions about the natureof reality. If you tend to notice and be awed by beauty and purpose withinNature wherever you might care to look, you are perhaps more likely to bedissatisfied with brute-factual explanations. What I have tried to highlight isthe sheer fantastic nature of reality, for Nature deserves this at the veryleast. For my part, I side with Davies. There is most definitely something fishygoing on both in and around us. What is more, this fishiness is very subtle andmystifying. And an immense source of wonder.At the end of The Mind of God, Davies sticks his neck out and suggests that onecannot get at the ultimate meaning of reality by logical and rational thoughtalone. These are brave words coming from a respectable scientist with anaward-winning reputation to defend. And Davies knows that an appeal to otherforms of thought for ascertaining answers to the “why” of the Universe iscontroversial, to say the least. He writes:Although many metaphysical and theistic theories seem contrived or childish,they are not obviously more absurd than the belief that the universe exists, andexists in the form it does, reasonlessly. It seems at least worth trying toconstruct a metaphysical theory that reduces some of the arbitrariness of theworld. But in the end a rational explanation for the world in the sense of aclosed and complete system of logical truths is almost certainly impossible. . .. If we wish to progress beyond, we have to embrace a different concept of“understanding” from that of rational explanation. Possibly the mystical path isa way to such an understanding.6 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts41]There ends Davies’ exploration of God’s mind. Whatever one concludes about thefine-tuning of the Universe, there will always be some factor involved thatcannot be grasped by our normal conception since the factor in question isuncaused. If we side with the clumsy and arguably nutty multiple-Universescenario, we must admit that the infinite multitude of Universes were not causedby anything, that they just are, were, and always will be. And if, like me, youopt for just this one remarkable Universe, there is still the matter of theinitial setup, which also indicates some uncaused factor. In other words, theremust always have been a timeless and eternal “something” that existed. A chainof causes and effects cannot be extended back in time indefinitely because timeitself is believed to have had a beginning. Even if we smugly assume that theUniverse sprang out of “nothing,” a potential of some kind, quantum orotherwise, must have always existed. In fact, such a potential must be therichest and most powerful potential imaginable, as it gave rise to everything!Thus, however we look at things, we have no choice but to invoke an eternalsomething that cannot be explained in terms of something else. One cannot escapethis disturbing yet mildly innervating conclusion.A Return to Entheogenic WisdomIf we want answers to these most difficult questions, we need to be armed withnew forms of consciousness. Our normal frames of thought cannot cope withnotions of eternity and the like. And here we must once more face up to thepotential power of Nature’s entheogenic allies in elucidating the living mysteryof existence. The knowledge attained during the entheogenic experience as wellas the revelatory insights gained through superconscious perception of the worldarguably represent the most direct path to the kind of metaphysicalunderstanding alluded to by Davies. As far as I am aware, Davies is not clued into the epistemological virtues of visionary agents, for he explicitly statesthat he has never had a mystical experience. Open-minded scientists like himselfwould therefore do well to explore natural entheogens like the psilocybinmushroom, since their numinous effects are in the here and now and not limitedto the pages of mystical religious literature.Psilocybin can potentiate new and enhanced states of consciousness, and it isprecisely in such a state that one may glimpse an answer or two to the riddle ofreality. Of course, if you are happy with a simple god scenario in which anomnipotent being just sits around studying its creation and maybe dabbling withit now and again, then good for you. However, many of us will want to pursue themystery in more depth, hoping to attain some deeper and less supernaturalinsight into the nature of reality. Without doubt, psilocybin can be utilized inthis noble and justified pursuit. Entheogens work, just as mathematics works.And it is precisely because they do work and because they do allow one toconfront big truths that they elicit fear and mistrust in the West. Indeed, asMcKenna attested in his book The Archaic Revival, much of the New Agemovement—ostensibly a movement devoted to forging spiritual awareness—isactually a move away from Nature’s psychedelic dimension.People love seeking answers. If you were to suggest to people that the time ofseeking is over and that the chore is now to face the answer, that’s more of achallenge! Anyone can sweep up around the ashram for a dozen years whilecongratulating themselves that they are following Baba into enlightenment. Ittakes courage to take psychedelics—real courage. Your stomach clenches, yourpalms grow damp, because you realize this is real—this is going to work. Not intwelve years, not in twenty years, but in an hour! What I see in the wholespiritual enterprise is a great number of people supporting themselves in oneway or another on the basis of their lack of success. Were they ever to succeed,these enterprises would all be put out of business. But no one’s in a hurry forthat.7 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts42]A somewhat harsh evaluation, perhaps, but the point is taken. We are so immersedin the hypnotic spell of our material culture that we are unaccustomed to formsof perception and conception in which our normal frames of reference fade intoobscurity. In the innervating and inspirational glow of the psilocybinexperience, we suddenly find ourselves transported to a spiritually chargedrealm where metaphysical musing and theological speculation all but dissolve,giving way instead to a direct perception of the Other, an Overmind, orbiospherical mind, that somehow holds the keys to the purpose of life andconsciousness.With the continued emergence of information relating to the psilocybinexperience, we now have a raised platform upon which to stand to further ourunderstanding of the nature of reality and consciousness. Just as Newton claimedto have stood on the shoulders of giants to discern more clearly the nature ofthe Universe, we have reached the point in our culture where we can relaunch theshamanic spirit now vanishing from the rainforests of the Amazon and use it toblaze a trail into the depths of the mystery of our existence. Psychedelicagents, especially the fungal variety indigenous to most regions of thebiosphere, can yield knowledge otherwise unobtainable through traditional modesof perception and conception. Herein lies their greatest virtue. Until we makefull use of Nature’s ambient psychedelic resources, our understanding of realitywill remain incomplete.image [../Images/9781594779374_003.jpg]We have seen how the Universe is a kind of ongoing utterance, or self-writingstory, built upon the language-like integration of information; that informationis everywhere being organized; and that consciousness is itself a “finer” formof information arising from the web of informing relationships converging in theneuronal architecture of the brain. Thus we are like playing pieces in auniversal game of chess, pieces whose function, role, and meaning are determinedaccording to our relationship to all else. And, in our attempt to apprehend thiscomputational game, we have reached the point where we wonder at the ultimatesoftware whose rules govern the field of play.If, as seems highly probable, the major pattern-inducing properties of theUniverse are not accidental, then we might discern some will or intention lyingat the very heart of Nature. We might wish to shake hands with Nature and say“nice work” or “good game.” I have to employ a modicum of humor here as thesituation we are now in is somewhat bizarre. Because an accelerating flow ofself-organizing information appears to be focused upon our planet, it mustsurely be directed toward some culmination point. What then will be the finaloutput of this particular evolving part of the Universe? What on Earth is thepoint? Where are we being drawn? What pattern has yet to evolve or be resolved?A Vision SharedBefore we take a final look at the implications of the psilocybin experience foran understanding of “the meaning of it all,” let me summarize the heady ideasoutlined in the past few chapters in the form of a vivid visual metaphor. Thismetaphor embraces everything of significance in the computational/informationalparadigm, allowing us to view everything at once, in one great image. So, relaxand get your mind’s eye ready as I present to you the River of Life thoughtexperiment. (I should point out that I came up with this metaphor independentlyof Richard Dawkins, who uses a somewhat similar metaphor in his book River outof Eden.)Picture a big lake of still water. This is an informational void, endowed onlywith capacity and potential. All the myriad particles of the water can belikened to potential bits of information, though all are in the same uniformstate. There is just still water, no forms or patterns whatsoever, nothing ofinterest, no dialogue-like flow of information or anything. Still, it is aninitial state; the lake of formless water exists. You and I creatively imagineit and format it that way.Now, take a monstrously big stick and begin to stir the lake. The stirringaction corresponds to a law, or rule, or intent operating on the state of thelake water. Already, the stirring action begins to create currents, eddies, andvortices of turbulence. As you continue to stir the lake, ever more of theseforms and patterns emerge in the water. Notice that the ripples, patterns, andwaves that are forming and that flow across and beneath the surface of the lakeare all facets of one whole entity—the entire lake. No one part of the water isisolated; rather, there is just one system of water swirling and slopping about.This is the fluidic, interconnected “informational stuff” of the lake that hasbeen transformed from a featureless state to an informed state through thestirring action. The stirring action represents the rules or laws commanding thebehavior of the water. If you cannot picture the water in the lake as aninterconnected continuum, then scale the lake down to a bathtub of water. Whenyou slosh the water around in a bath, it is clear that there is just one fluidicentity lapping about; no single region is isolated.If we continue to stir the lake in a particular way, more and more complexpatterns emerge. Let us also allow the water in the lake to gradually flow outand form a river, the leading edge of which contains the most organized patternsso far generated within the water. Swirling vortices are created that persistindefinitely. Now imagine these forms meeting with one another in the frothyforefront of the rushing river. Somehow they replicate themselves according tothe precise manner in which we have done the stirring. So now we have a flowingriver containing replicating patterns of information bearing definitelanguage-like relations with one another. When these fluidic patterns meet, akind of dialogue ensues in which the patterns inform one another, creating yetmore diverse patterns.We can add to the laws inherent in our stirring by incorporating new laws in theform of precisely shaped rocks over which the river flows (akin to constants).These rocks will further determine what kinds of forms arise in the water. Asthe river progresses over the contrived rocks, perhaps different types of swirlsare generated, such that new patterns emerge even more complex than theirpredecessors. As the number of enduring patterns increase, so too will theamount of relations between them. And yet all forms remain part of the sameintegrated fluidic stuff. What one pattern of water does in one part of theriver will eventually be felt everywhere else, for there is but one singleinterconnected substance in which all these events unfold.Let a long span of time elapse. If we look to the leading edge of the river, wemight find that the patterns that have now emerged are truly lifelike. Patternsthat bear a specific and enduring role in relation to the rest of the waterbehave like organisms. It does not matter that these patterns consist only ofwater; what matters is their robust and self-sustaining structure and theirformal relations to the other patterns around them and to the rest of the water.Now we reach the climax of our metaphor. Picture the river cascading over arocky cliff face, creating a waterfall. Take a close slow-motion look at theleading splashes, the leading edge of the creative flow of water. Elaboratehumanoid life forms have now emerged, representative of the most evolvedpatterns of flowing information. Minds might eventually form within thesecreatures, minds being yet further patterns born out of the informational fluid,albeit of a highly evolved kind dependent on a huge amount of informationalconvergence. History foams into being across the face of rocks, cities flow inand out of existence, cultures come and go in the complex splashes emanatingfrom the turbulent onrush of water. And at the very edge of the torrential flowwe see informational entities like ourselves. And yes, such conscious beingsmight even come to wonder at the nature of the stuff around them. They mighteven conclude that it is all but one integrating confluential substance—that offluidic information in process.It is important to hold in mind that the eventually conscious property of thefluidic flow of information was determined by the precise way in which westirred the water and the precise form of the rocks over which the river flowed.It was not accidental; rather, the flow was deliberately organized andconfigured so as to eventually produce consciousness, the most evolved kindinformational pattern. In this way, the river of information has come to knowitself and its origins. The river literally woke up to its true nature. Areflection of some sort arose.Perhaps, then, the actual river of organic life that has spawned us has alreadyattained its ultimate purpose, for we are the means by which Nature has becomeself-aware. Does this mean that we should now sit back comfortably because allis complete? Is the goal of Nature self-awareness of the kind we have alreadyattained? Surely not. There must be more to it than that. I would surmise thatthe “climax” of reality has yet to become manifest, at least in our neck of thewoods. After all, complex computer programs often yield a final output, thisresult depending upon what the user wanted from the program. In our rivermetaphor, this would mean that there would be a climactic state emerging at thebottom of the waterfall, a kind of final solution verily propelled and coercedinto existence.Because the information-integration processes displayed by our culture in thewake of evolving computer technology and computerized telecommunication systemsshows no signs of abating and appears to be speeding up at an unprecedentedrate, and because of the type of information accessed during the psilocybinexperience, I believe that the destined output of the biosphere is somethingthat human culture will eventually usher in. In other words, the “intent” ofNature is now being conveyed through the evolutionary development of humanculture and human consciousness. If so, this implies that conscious humanculture with its attendant technology represents the fulfillment of some kind ofcosmic imperative. This is the sort of highly speculative idea taken up in thenext chapter."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/9781594779374_002.jpg]N I N EThe Fantastic HypothesisOur aim now is to discover more about the nature and intent of the intelligencethat would appear to underlie the reality process. This intelligence, whateverit is exactly, seems to be causally manifest through the specific law, order,and self-organizing properties of Nature. Hence we witness the inevitableprogressive emergence of phenomena like stars, molecular compounds, organisms,and even consciousness. In other words, because the laws of Nature force thereality process to give rise to stars, molecular compounds, organisms, andconsciousness (the means by which Nature can know itself), then this is stronglysuggestive that there is some sort of purposeful intelligence connected withthose laws. In any case, the patterns of information forced into existence byNature appear to behave according to various systems of logic that we canloosely refer to as physics, chemistry, genetics, biology, psychology, and soon.The forms of logic cited above are language-like, computation-like, and enfoldedwithin one another in a kind of nested hierarchy. The language-like logic ofphysics acts as a substrate from which the language-like logic of chemistryemerges. In turn, the language-like logic of chemistry gives rise to thelanguage-like logic of molecular biology. And so on. Eventually, highly advancedbio-logic leads to brains that embody patterns of information we call minds.Conscious minds are subsequently able to contemplate the intelligence thatlikely governs this astonishingly creative set of processes. All creativity, allorder, and all life must derive from a fundamental creative property of Nature,a property that is best explained by invoking a willful, ubiquitousintelligence, the very same intelligence that entheogens like the psilocybinmushroom can bring into sharp focus.We can boldly refer to this quixotic reasoning as being but one corollary of thefantastic hypothesis. The fantastic hypothesis views reality, or Nature, as adeliberate and intelligently behaving system. According to the fantastichypothesis, we are woven into a tide of self-organizing information,interconnected throughout, whose spectacular final purpose awaits us. For if thenatural tendency of the Universe is to foster the integration and cohesion ofmore and more information; then, as with gravity in the “physical” realm drawingtogether atoms and elements, the result of this integrative tendency in therealm of human consciousness might be to draw some kind of “truthful solution”into being, like an ultimate pattern falling into place.Such a fantastic hypothesis is waged against the prevailing null hypothesis. Thenull hypothesis decrees a morose state of affairs in which our Universe isaccidental, but one of an infinite number, devoid of reason and purpose, and inwhich the earthly psilocybin experience is no more than a trap, an aberrationdistracting us from more pressing concerns.However, it really does seem evident (sometimes obviously so) that somemysteriously intelligent presence pervades Nature. We have seen that life andconsciousness were poised to emerge out of the Universe right from the start,maybe in many locations throughout the cosmos. Now that we are here and now thatwe have realized the breathtaking situation in which we are so intimatelyinvolved, we can rightly demand that the mystery of the Other reveal itself tous in more detail. The momentum gathered by our inquiries is thus set to lead usinto yet more rarefied territory. There is no point in backing down now. If Iwere to stop before making a last leap into idea-space, I would be no more thana psychedelic homme fatale, withdrawing supposition before a climax worthy ofour subject matter had been attained.That we have already posited an intelligent Other made of information that canmanifest within an individual psyche through the medium of sacred plants andfungi is perhaps not so controversial at this point. Such an “intelligence ofsorts” has been a kind of soft, conceptual pillow upon which to rest ourstretched minds once the visionary effects of entheogenic compounds and theimplications thereof have been acknowledged. But whereas the religiously mindedmight well be firmly acquainted with the notion of a creative intelligence atwork in the Universe, those of us who eschew traditional religion might bewilling to entertain the idea of some kind of intelligence over and above thatof Homo sapiens only if the idea can be properly fleshed out. This is especiallytrue if one has not personally experienced the tremendous spiritual power ofpsilocybin.Anyone can suggest, or imagine, that some sort of distributed intelligenceinfuses reality. Many might intuit so. But to develop a coherent conceptualframework with which to understand the inferred intelligence and grasp itsagenda is another matter entirely. Indeed, the risk of heresy and banishmentfrom the scientific community can only escalate if one prosecutes suchspeculation to its furthest limits. However, since I have no scientific tenureto defend, no academic office to be summarily kicked out of, I am at liberty toset forth more radical ideas. These ideas will hopefully bind all that has gonebefore into an aesthetically pleasing whole, which is, after all, the wayreality looks to be—an integrated whole. So, keeping our minds open, let usponder the idea that Nature is blessed with a sophisticated intelligence aboveand beyond that of our species.Facing the OptionsShould We Go Whole Hog, Including the Postage?If we accept, even just for the duration of this chapter, that consciousness isthe preordained output of an immense computational system, then the futuresurprises in store for us might be great indeed. Since we are presumably thefirst species of earthly life to be able to fully confront the mystery of being(at least through science and art—although who knows what dolphins think about),then it seems likely that our conscious role within Nature’s informationalhierarchy must be of functional import. If some of the ideas that I will shortlybe introducing have any bearing on this issue, then our collective future willbe awesome, to say the least. If we consider for a moment the dramatic leap incomplexity and information integration that separates the primeval emergence ofa single-celled bacterium (in itself highly complex) three and a half billionyears ago from, say, the emergence of Tokyo, with its inconceivably vastconcatenation of informational activity, then what would a comparable leap inevolution produce? If reality is being driven by intelligence, then whatsurprises still lie in store?Before we can assess these questions, it makes sense to step back a little andlook in more general terms at the idea of a “higher intelligence” (let me addthat from here on, when I discuss such an intelligence, I mean it to besynonymous with the Other, or at least that the Other is an expression of it).As far as I can see, if we invoke some kind of higher intelligence in operationwithin the reality process, then there are three basic options concerning itsnature: the intelligence exists outside the dimensions of normal reality, justas a programmer lies outside a computer system; the intelligence isrepresentative of an extremely advanced form of life existing elsewhere in theUniverse; or the Universe is like an organism and the intelligence existsthroughout Nature.Already we appear to have gate-crashed the pulp storylines so beloved by sci-fiwriters. In defense of this move, we should bear in mind that, whatever thecase, reality is already like fiction. Why things should be the way they are inthis neck of the cosmos is decidedly strange, with or without psilocybineticspeculation. To suggest that reality is anything but remarkable and mysteriousis to be a victim of either tiredness or depression. In fact I am prepared to goso far as to say that there is nothing quite as strange as human history andhuman consciousness within the ongoing reality process. You don’t need cropcircles or ghosts or faces on Mars or convoluted notions of semi-reptilianilluminati controlling the world to be stimulated and awestruck. The Universe asit is, with conscious human observers, is more impressive and far more worthy ofour awe and attention. Indeed, it is only because we are so used to beingself-aware components of Nature that we do not continually marvel at the fact.Upon careful reflection, however, the ability of Nature to evoke the tree oflife and nourish its evolution to the point of conscious brains is trulyextraordinary and indicative that some sort of cosmic imperative is beingfulfilled. Curiously, we seem willing to accept plenty of other far more radicalnotions about Nature without as much as a murmur of disbelief. Not surprisingly,Terence McKenna repeatedly made the point that a belief in the big bang, inwhich the entire space-time continuum is considered to have sprung out of aminuscule dimensionless point, requires an inordinate stretching of credulity.Indeed, if you can believe this, then you can surely believe anything.If you still don’t see the strangeness to reality, then locate some pictures ofgalaxies and supernovas, study them closely, and then step into a packed trainduring rush hour. Do you not detect a curious twist to reality here? Is it not atrifle telling that the Universe should have yielded such organismicarrangements of information, that it should have engineered us sentient,bipedal, hominid creatures, who patter busily around the surface of a rockcircling a star? Above you lie billions of miles of space and billions of suns.So too below you and all around you. In fact, some estimates suggest that we aresurrounded by 125 billion galaxies, which means there are more stars in theheavens than grains of sand on the Earth. We are literally a suspended anomalywithin a twinkling, starry mystery whose solution remains suspended. And yet itapparently all sprang out of nothing and for no good reason!Given the astonishingly fictional quality of existence, I feel totally justifiedin outlining the possible nature of an inferred creative intelligence in moredetail. In the last analysis, it makes just as much sense to do this than itdoes to enthuse upon the null hypothesis, which asserts that all this“astonishingness” is without reason. Indeed, it is arguably nuts to suggest thatall and everything exists for no rhyme or reason. One even suspects that thiskind of mindless interpretation of life and consciousness stems from anego-obsessed psyche that is only prepared to describe our own abilities in termsof high intelligence. Hence, the tiresome popular sentiment that we are verysmart and purposeful while the rest of Nature is very dumb and pointless.Back to the chase. The aforementioned three options concerning the nature of ahigher intelligence (or Other, as we can also call it) have been explored in oneway or another by the well known sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick, who used fictionas an unbounded medium in which to put across some decidedly mystical ideasabout what he believed to be the true nature of reality. By looking at somefictional scenarios that he created, we shall be able to more clearly divine thefeasibility of at least one of the options open to us.Do Psychedelic Shamans Dream of VALIS?For most people, Philip K. Dick (hereafter known as PKD) is best known throughfilms like Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report, and A Scanner Darkly,which were all based on his writings. Classic movies like The Matrix and VanillaSky also owe a great debt to PKD’s work. What is not so well known is that PKDwas a bit of a latter-day mystic, a man who spent the last decade or so of hislife struggling to come to terms with a series of visionary experiences (notrelated to psychedelics) that befell him in the early 1970s. In theseexperiences, PKD felt as if some vast cosmic intelligence was communicating withhim, as if a deity was slipping him secret information. Such was the impact ofthese theophanies that he chose to incorporate their thematic content into anumber of novels as well as an eight-thousand-page exegesis. To theconsternation of his peers, PKD began to be not a little obsessed with ideas of“divine invasion” and the like, his last books testifying to his escalatinginterest in theology and theistic philosophy (interestingly, his last novel, TheTransmigration of Timothy Archer, partly concerns the search for a sacredmushroom).Since his death it has been speculated that PKD suffered from what is known astemporal lobe epilepsy—a brain disorder that can lead to hallucinatoryexperiences—and that this explains his mystical encounters. However, leavingaside the contentiousness of this claim, it does not deal with the burning issueof immediate mystical experience. To label an experience in order to explain itaway is to avoid the very real nature of the mystical experience, however itshould arise. In fact, as Huxley noted in The Doors of Perception, we should notbe surprised if there is always unusual neuronal activity concurrent with amystical experience, for, as we have seen, modified neuronal firing patterns arerelated to expanded forms of consciousness. Altered forms of awareness demandaltered brain processes, and such a change in brain state can be achieved inmany different ways, whether through psilocybin mushrooms, endogenous DMT, yoga,meditation, fasting, or spontaneous epileptic disturbances. Mystical experienceis therefore not to be conveniently disposed of with a diagnostic label.Even before his visionary experiences, PKD had long fought to discover the truenature of reality. It was his pet fascination. In a talk he delivered in thelate 1970s, he admitted that for all the years he had thought about the question“what is reality?” he had gotten no further than concluding that reality wasthat which remained even if you stopped believing in it. Admittedly a thindefinition, it is nonetheless indicative that the true nature of reality is notso easily pinned down.PKD juggled with countless explanations for his mystical experiences. Someinvolved a Judeo-Christian God, others involved the Logos outlined in some ofthe Gnostic gospels (these are the “alternative” gospels dug up at Nag Hammadi,Egypt, in 1945), while others even opted for an advanced extraterrestrialintelligence. Whatever the case, PKD was certain that he had been “contacted” bysome form of advanced transcendental intelligence-cum-Other.One of his more enduring theories concerned VALIS, which is an acronym for “vastactive living intelligence system,” a notion that accords well with ourintelligent Other. In the semiautobiographical novel of the same name, VALIS isa hidden entity of immense power and sentience that is in the process ofinfiltrating our reality by establishing communication with certain individuals.These disclosures are experienced as theophany. For our purposes, the key pointis that VALIS is essentially outside of our dimension, but able to penetrate ourworld. The question arises as to the feasibility that a superior intelligenceexists in another dimension with the capacity to move across into ours. This isone of our fanciful options concerning the Other.To more fully understand what PKD was suggesting, consider the plot of hisacclaimed novel Ubik. In this story, the main characters are seriously blown upin an explosion at the start of the story and then placed in a kind ofcollective suspended animation machine that keeps a portion of their brainprocesses functioning. In this way the characters enjoy what PKD calls a“half-life.” What is more, the collective nature of their half-lives ensuresthat they experience a simulated reality, a reality so real that the half-lifersfail to realize that they are no longer in the real world. In other words, theydon’t realize that they are actually wired up in the half-life unit of theBeloved Brethren Moratorium. Indeed, they falsely believe that they survived theexplosion with just a few scratches (you can now see why The Matrix is adecidedly Philipdickish movie).Our interest grows when we see what happens when someone outside of theirsimulated reality system attempts to communicate with them (using the standardelectrode headphones of course). At one stage in the tale, the protagonist, JoeChip, who is unaware that he now exists inside a simulated reality, is contactedby someone from the “outside.” This communication is experienced by Chip as aneerie sequence of synchronistic events in his simulated world. For instance, hebegins finding significant messages everywhere—scrawled upon washroom mirrorsand turning up on matchbook labels and in bits of consumer junk. Personalmessages even begin interrupting TV shows (this idea was borrowed to good effectin the Emmy-award winning BBC sci-fi drama series Life on Mars). In short, thecommunicator has invaded Chip’s world in such a way that the communication getsdistributed across different media, turning up in the most unlikely of placesrather than manifesting as a big booming voice coming out of the sky.I think it is this cunning idea, which PKD used on many fictional occasions,that captures his views on the nature of VALIS. VALIS was an “outside”intelligence able to penetrate our world, revealing itself through mysticalexperience and through the unlikely juxtaposition of meaningfully relatedevents. Can we possibly utilize this notion and map it onto our idea of theOther?If we were to do this, then it would be tantamount to suggesting that the“programmer” of the Universal Computation is able to “jump into” the program,reaching in as it were to influence the state transition of the computation. Orperhaps this transcendental influence can only be felt in the psyche, in whichcase all theophanies would represent the manifestation of the Other as itpenetrates our reality.But what does it mean to be outside the system, outside the UniversalComputation process? Can there really be an outside? It is possible to imaginethat in the future we will be able to create a kind of simulated universe or anelaborate virtual-reality world that we can enter for years, if not a lifetime.And yet despite the fact that there will indeed be an outside to a simulatedreality, we cannot say with certainty that there is also an outside to ourpresent reality. If we do entertain the notion of a dimension outside of ourworld, we run up against the old infinite regress pit of despair, for surely the“outsides” could be continued indefinitely. In other words, if the intelligentOther exists outside our (simulated) reality, then what lies outside the Other’sdimension?It is these dilemmas, which would appear to be insurmountable, that lead me tothink that the solution to the Other cannot be found by appealing to asupernatural “outside the system” option. Indeed, we have already seen that theOther appears to represent a creative process conveyed by the mind wherebyinformation organizes itself and takes on lifelike properties. The Other,therefore, is surely more likely to be found firmly entwined within the Universealong with ourselves (even if only as a mysterious potential expressed undercertain circumstances). If we once more restrict ourselves to this one Universe,then at least our theoretical model will be somewhat constrained and moreamenable to a single holistic explanation. This does not deny the existence ofPKD’s VALIS; rather, it locates VALIS within our reality. Somewhere.Sophisticated ET’sCould the Other somehow be connected to a highly advanced extraterrestrialintelligence? I don’t know about you, but I have a strong dislike of talk ofprecocious ET civilizations. Perhaps this is due in part to the often-ridiculousdepictions of aliens in sci-fi movies (the film Contact, based on a novel by thelate Carl Sagan, is a rare exception). Be that as it may, the notion that highlyadvanced life forms exist elsewhere in the Universe is far from an unacceptableidea. Indeed, NASA has spent millions of dollars funding SETI, the search for ETintelligence.This use of the term intelligence is interesting. It is not the search for ETlife, ET art, or ET real estate, but the search for the communicatory signals ofsome other intelligence apart from our own. The assumption is that intelligenceis a universal phenomenon, a mental capacity if you like, that will be similarwherever it should arise. Furthermore, such an intelligence is presumed, likeourselves, to have a strong urge to communicate its presence across the vastdepths of space in order to search for another intelligence. This is why theSETI program has sent out radio signals bearing mathematical formulas (likechemical formulas and atomic numbers). These signals are assumed to embody thesort of universal significance that an advanced ET intelligence wouldappreciate. If the Earth were to detect signals from some other star system, itwould indicate beings similar to us. Alas, no such signals have been detectedthus far.Our assumptions about ET intelligence determine how we go about trying toestablish interstellar communication. We know only of human intelligence andhuman thinking; it is by no means certain that an alien intelligence would beexactly like our own. If intelligence is a capacity—moreover a capacity toexhibit purposeful behavior and intentional-ity—then as intelligence evolves, sotoo might the intent of intelligence evolve. The intelligence of an advanced ETcivilization, should one or many exist elsewhere in the Universe, might haveevolved way beyond our ken, so much so that we would not recognize its presenceshould it be upon us already. Alternatively, an ET intelligence might be so faraway as to make it a practical impossibility to establish effectivecommunication. Although there are estimated to be untold millions of planetspotentially hospitable to life in the Universe, most are millions of light yearsaway. Should intelligent life forms on one of these planets have sent out aradio message, by the time it is received elsewhere the senders might well havebecome extinct.If we put aside notions of radio broadcasts, it may still be possible toconceive of other types of communication involving radically different means.Here, I can once more look to McKenna, who suggested various alien scenarios toaccount for the psilocybin experience. Before I lay his ET ideas on you, Ishould stress that McKenna liked to oscillate in his psychedelic speculation. Onthe one hand, he consistently pushed for an earthbound biospherical explanationfor the Other (which I will deal with later), while on the other hand, heinvoked the idea of an alien intelligence as lying at the heart of the visionarystate. He was led to entertain extreme speculation because of the equallyextreme nature of psychedelic phenomenology. This I understand and I completelysupport his claim that the Other often appears distinctly alien in nature,though I am less enthusiastic about attributing this alien quality of visions toan actual ET presence.In True Hallucinations, McKenna speculates that alien probes might have oncevisited our planet in the distant past and injected “seeded genes” into theprevailing ecology. These “seeded genes” are the DNA portions of plants thatcode for tryptamine alkaloids like psilocybin and DMT. These alien genes arecarried along in the terrestrial flow of evolutionary events until they areencountered by a species open to the information that is broadcasted from theprobes. The precise communication issuing from the alien probes depends on theintelligence of the particular species that encounters and consumes the “loaded”plants.The first point to make about this controversial suggestion is that interstellarautomated probes with the ability to transmit information is not a new or crassidea. A number of SETI scientists, in thinking about ET communication and themajor problem of galactic distance, have concluded that one solution would be todesign self-replicating probes that are able to multiply at an exponential rateduring their voyages through space. Through such replication over aeons of time,the network of probes would eventually cover entire galaxies. This is anintriguing idea that has its origin in the work of Von Neumann, who, you willrecall, proved that it was possible in principle to design self-replicatingmachines. If machines like this could be built by an advanced ET intelligence,it would offer a way to eventually make contact with other life forms in distantstar systems.McKenna has taken this idea a step further and argued that once probes of thissort locate a life-bearing planet, they do not send out binary radio broadcastsor “How do you do?” signals, but carry out a much more subtle and long-term formof communication. In McKenna’s view, the probes have engineered specificmessage-conducting genes whose signal becomes active after ingestion of thoseplants and fungi carrying the alien genes. In his final analysis, McKenna claimsthat once a species like our own has reached a certain point in its culturaldevelopment, then the probes will yield information on how to complete thecontact.Well, these are truly quixotic claims. I also detect the spirit of PKD in themas well, for in the book VALIS an ancient ET satellite (somehow connected withan “outside” intelligence) circles the Earth, selectively firing informationinto people’s brains. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with alien probescenarios. On the contrary, they serve to remind us that an advanced alienintelligence might well have radical technologies at its disposal—after all, wegrant that they are alien and advanced—and that we should maybe think againabout how we go about sending out signals and looking for signals.The biggest problem I have with such an ET scenario is that it fails to accountfor the significance of the software-like laws of Nature that, as we now know,are bound with our very existence and all forms of informational patterning.Furthermore, we are left without an explanation for how the alien species itselfcame to be. It is also not clear why the alien intelligence would want to useseeded genes to conduct communication. Though they are potentially long-lasting,it still remains a rather haphazard and totally unpredictable method ofinformation transfer, and it runs the very real risk of total failure throughplant extinctions. If an ET intelligence were indeed able to build sophisticatedprobes with which to scour the Universe, then surely when the probes haveencountered an intelligence worth contacting they would use some direct andunambiguous method of communication rather than having to construct“tailor-made” genes. And then there is the problem with the age of the probesand the distance of the probe senders. If such an intelligence were a millionlight years away, is it really feasible that a useful contact could be made?Unless faster-than-light technology has been developed (which immediatelyintroduces paradoxes), then any hope of interstellar communication across reallyvast distances is all but futile. And if the ETs had telepathy or some kind ofadvanced capacity like that, then why bother with cumbersome probes in the firstplace?On other occasions, McKenna concedes that the alien is merely the Other in oneof its many symbolic guises, and I think that this is more likely to be thecase. As I discussed earlier, the alien or the advanced ET is a major symbolpeculiar to the modern era. Perhaps this is one of the Other’s “favorite”metaphors with which to express its nature. If this is so, we can dispense withall notions of ET civilizations millions of light years away and concentrateupon our final option, namely that the Other is somehow built into reality likeourselves and that its intelligence is not far away but all around us. Whatfollows is a prelude to the final option.Is the Reality Process Intelligent?One scientist who believed the Universe to be home to a vast and highly evolvedintelligence was the late unconventional British astronomer Sir Fred Hoyle.However, the intelligence conceived by Hoyle and outlined in his little-knownbook The Intelligent Universe does not belong to some ET species existingelsewhere, nor does it refer to God, for Hoyle was at heart an atheist. Rather,Hoyle believed that a non-omnipotent intelligence preceded us in existence andhelped to create life on Earth. Let me explain.Hoyle suggested that life did not start in the turmoil of the soupy primevaloceans of the Earth as is commonly accepted. Hoyle argued instead that pre-lifemolecules and simple microorganisms might exist throughout the Universe amidinterstellar dust clouds and within the interior of comets and meteors. Cometsoften contain the same proportion of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen asthe Earth’s biosphere and are therefore potentially capable of giving birth toprimitive replicating microorganisms. Through their “free lift,” suchmicroorganisms could be dispersed onto the planets that lie in the path of theircometary hosts. Because the Earth and indeed any planetary body is continuouslybombarded by cosmic bodies, it would only be a matter of time before themicroorganisms and molecules surviving their trip found themselves in asustainable environment in which to further evolve. Hoyle reckoned this is howlife started on Earth—that the Earth has been seeded by simple life forms andorganic molecules.To bolster his theory, Hoyle pointed out that what appear to be fossilizedmicroorganisms have been found inside some of the various meteorite fragmentsthat have been recovered here on Earth. In addition, many microorganisms haveevolved such a hard protective layer that they are able to withstand massivedoses of radiation (some bacteria have even been found living contentedly withinnuclear reactors!). This form of protection is an essential requirement shouldmicroorganisms have formed in interstellar space but an inexplicable adaptationaccording to the conditions here on Earth. It has also been found thatmicroorganisms exist up to forty-five miles above the Earth’s surface, which isconsistent with the theory that the Earth is being continually bombarded withlife-bearing cosmic debris.Hoyle went further. He claimed that not only did life originate from space, butthat the evolutionary process on our planet has since been “directed” throughthe continuous arrival here of microorganisms. Hoyle suggested that some ofthese “invading” microorganisms are able to attach their own DNA to the hostorganisms that they encounter, much as viruses function by incorporating theirown DNA into the host’s genome. While some of these viruslike interstellarmicroorganisms might be harmful, some would be sure to confer an advantageshould their DNA successfully incorporate itself into the DNA of a compatiblehost organism. (Think of mitochondria, the energy-producing organelles insideanimal cells that have their own DNA and are thought to have once beenfree-living bacterial organisms that developed a symbiotic relationship withanimal cells.) In this way more and more genetic information is integrated fromthe basically unending source of DNA reaching the Earth from space.Hoyle did not give up there either. In accounting for the unbelievable series ofcosmic coincidences that have facilitated the emergence of organic life, Hoylespeculated that the microorganisms in interstellar clouds also serve toinfluence the formation of stars and planets (by means of physical processes).In other words, the creative cosmic processes we observe are the result of anactive intelligence that is forever striving to survive—with the addeddifficulty, according to Hoyle, that the physical laws of the Universe arealways changing. In The Intelligent Universe, he writes:The apparent coincidences which allow carbon-based life to exist throughout ourgalaxy and in other galaxies might well be temporary possibilities in a Universewhere the applications of the physical laws are changing all the time. Thispoint of view . . . suggests that in the future the Universe may evolve so thatcarbon-based life becomes impossible, which in turn suggests that throughout theUniverse intelligence is struggling to survive against changing physical laws,and that the history of life on Earth has only been a minor skirmish in thiscontest.1 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts43]Are we to believe then that the laws of Nature gradually change and that at somedistant time in the past a powerful intelligence engineered things so that inthe future, carbon-based life would utilize the newly prevailing cosmicconditions? This is indeed what Hoyle asked us to believe. He summed up histhinking in the following singularly profound sentence in which he states thisabout our species: “We are the intelligence that preceded us in its new materialrepresentation—or rather, we are the re-emergence of that intelligence, thelatest embodiment of its struggle for survival.”2[../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts44]When I first encountered Hoyle’s radical panspermia theory (the notion that lifeis being seeded throughout the cosmos), I was naturally curious. Shortly afterthis, new scientific evidence coincidentally emerged that seemed to support atleast part of his theory. A news flash in New Scientist declared that “moleculesof life” had been detected in space. Hawk-eyed American radio astronomers hadspied glycine—an amino acid and a potential building block of organic life—in adense interstellar dust cloud near the center of our galaxy. This kind offinding is totally in line with Hoyle’s speculations. Indeed, a few years later,the comet Hale-Bopp was analyzed as it passed near the Earth, and it too wasfound to contain the molecules of which amino acids are made. Therefore, wecannot rule out all of Hoyle’s theory, and we must consider his assertions moreclosely.The compelling aspect of Hoyle’s proposal is that it is assuredly grand,employing as it does a mix of science and near-mystical speculation. Hoyleattempted to account for the fortuitous nature of the Universe by arguing thatthe initial widespread presence of microorganisms somehow influences star andplanet formation. Everything was engineered by some previous intelligence.However, we are still left without an explanation as to how this previousintelligence emerged. In fact, Hoyle appealed to the so-called steady statetheory of the Universe that he himself helped to develop in the late 1940s as analternative to the big bang scenario (it was, in fact, Hoyle who originallycoined the term big bang in order to make light of such anexplosion-from-nothingtheory). The steady state theory holds that there was nobig bang at all (only “little bangs”), and that the Universe has existedindefinitely. Within this eternal Universe an intelligence has been forevermodifying itself in order to survive the subtly changing laws of physics. Hoyleeven concluded that the religious impulse of our species arises because we areborn with an instinct that leads us to remember our origins, an instinct writteninto our DNA by the intelligence that preceded us.It all seems very neat and tidy, and I am sure that there is some grain of truthin Hoyle’s “eternal intelligence” theory. However, the element that is lackingis the role and effect of entheogenic agents, unless of course they were alsoengineered by the intelligence that preceded us. If they were, then Hoyle’stheory might well offer us the ultimate truth about reality. Then again, we mustaccept that the Universe has been in existence forever with the caveat that thelaws of physics continually change and force the intelligence to re-createitself. To my mind, this is not an aesthetically “clean” solution. As I said,how did the intelligence develop such sophistication and creative power in thefirst place? Moreover, how come the Universe has bits and parts conducive tocreative manipulation? And how and why should the laws of Nature change? If thelaws were to continually change, the Universe might surely run the risk oflosing its existence completely at some stage due to destructive physical laws.And Hoyle did not convincingly show how microorganisms are able to mastermindthe formation of stars and planets, nor was he able to deal a deathly blow tothe big bang scenario currently accepted by most cosmologists.As we have seen, it seems much more likely that all of the cosmic coincidencesnecessary for life and consciousness to arise are connected with the way theUniverse was originally configured at the time of the big bang. If this is thecase, we are again left with this one significant Universe fine-tuned from thestart. Or, to put it another way, we are left with Nature, a system in which thecapacity for ever-more-exquisite forms of self-organization reflects some kindof intelligence and intention.Still, Hoyle’s intelligent Universe is certainly one of the most cogentscenarios I have yet come across that attempts to explain the mystery of realityin essentially scientific terms, even despite its failure to specificallyaddress altered states of consciousness. I think it is possible to utilize someof Hoyle’s ideas and rework them. The prelude to the final option is over. Armedwith the fantastic hypothesis outlined at the start of this chapter, we are nowready to focus on what I consider its most likely and most brilliantimplications.Recalling the Biospherical MindOn a previous occasion I referred to the Other as a biospherical mind, a termthat, although doubtless too far-fetched for some, nonetheless captures theplanetary character of entheogenic flora and the rather spectacular organicvisions they often induce. Sacred plants and fungi appear like carefullydistributed “access codes” that create a different set of informationalrelations to converge within the brain/mind system, allowing one’s meaning inthe context of the rest of Nature to shift up a notch. In this way, as if tuningin to the otherwise occluded “higher frequencies” of Nature, one can come tobehold the numinous and intentional presence of the Other. Can we thereforelocate the Other here upon the Earth, somehow woven into the evolving fabric ofthe biosphere?Contemplating EvolutionThe fine-tuning of the Universe really comes into effect through theevolutionary process that has dominated the Earth’s surface regardless ofwhether this process originally began on Earth or in space (we can concede thatHoyle may have been correct with his panspermia theory). Either way, organicevolution can be looked on as an information-gaining process, for life has gonefrom simplicity to astounding complexity, from relatively simple arrangements oforganic information to highly organized arrangements, from simple proto-genes tohugely elaborate genomes, from primitive sensing to five fully fledged senses,and all because the fabric of the Universe encourages the evolution ofcarbon-based life. That evolution is essentially an information-gaining processis an important concept to bear in mind for what follows, forinformation-gaining is strongly associated with intelligently behaving systems,and I am from here on arguing that the biosphere is just such an intelligentsystem. Once again, information is a key factor in the ideas under discussion.In its broadest sense, the evolutionary process is currently being channeledthrough human culture. The knowledge acquired by our predecessors can be storedin computer networks like the Internet, books, folklore, music, dance, spokenlanguage, and so on, and this information accumulation—the growth inadvantageous wisdom if you like—can be passed on directly to successivegenerations. In this way, accurate information about the world grows asuncertainty decreases, and this process of information accretion allows ourspecies to dominate and understand the planet in next to no time compared withthe otherwise slow rates of (biological) evolutionary development that precededour species.With computerized telecommunication swiftly evolving and connecting the Earth’sstore of information, the biosphere looks to be wiring itself up into abioelectronic superorganism. Our physical bodies may no longer be evolving, butour culture and our technology are, especially our digital-communicationstechnology. Just as the neurons in our brains are able to transmit informationto one another at astounding speed, so too are we now able to electronicallysynapse with one other across the globe.This leads me to think that the assertion that the human brain is the mostcomplex “device” we know of is in fact a fallacy and that the biosphericalsystem in its interconnected totality is far and away more complex than a singlehuman brain. It must be. A brain cannot be understood properly unless thecontext in which it exists is taken into account. This context is theenvironment, with its vast network of language-like relations. Nothing remainsisolated within the environment. All organisms derive their meaning and theirfunction according to the role they play and the relations they have within theentire biospherical system. The biosphere is thus unimaginably more complex thanthe parts of which it is composed.Since the human brain is complex enough to embody intentional intelligence andsince much of its firing activity can only be understood in the light of itsintentional intelligence, I believe it tenable that, in an analogous way,evolution itself represents the ongoing intent of an intelligence somehowdistributed throughout Nature, and brought into focus through the biosphere (orany biosphere for that matter). In other words, somewhat like Hoyle suggested,the evolutionary process that has dominated the surface of the Earth is thearticulation of an intelligence of some kind.Returning to purely biological evolution, the idea that this process representsan intelligence in action is not to deny the reality of natural selection. Farfrom it. After all, to argue against natural selection (the process wherebycertain genetic variations and mutations are favored due to their ability tobetter replicate themselves) is to commit perhaps the cardinal sin against thelife sciences. I would not dare embarrass myself like that. No, I am simplysuggesting that evolution through lengthy sequential instances of naturalselection represents a natural intelligence in action as opposed to, say, humanintelligence in action.If we selectively breed dogs or cats, then we are carrying out a process ofartificial selection whereby we select those animal features that we would liketo see strengthened. In the case of selective breeding, therefore, humanintelligence governs the process. In the biosphere at large, natural selectiongoverns the process of evolution over longer stretches of time than artificialselection. Biological evolution is slow—exceedingly slow. So slow in fact thatwe can’t really see evolution happening. Whereas this is taken to mean thatNature is essentially dumb and mindless, I believe that we can view Nature inits entirety as a form of active intelligence, though of an order of magnitudewell above that displayed by our species. And by “Nature in its entirety,” Imean that we can view the biosphere as a continuum within which individualorganisms are in fluidic connection with each other and their surroundings.Influences pass in all directions. There is but one interconnected system inwhich evolution occurs. Remember our River of Life metaphor, in which all formsof the water were part of a coherent, interconnected whole? This is how we canthink of the biosphere, as representing a single sensible system in whichinformation is continuously being churned and integrated into greater andgreater patterns of coherence and complexity. Moreover, natural selection can beinterpreted as natural intelligence at work, quite literally a response ofNature to its own significant contextual configuration. In other words, theenvironment, as a context, always serves to highlight the sensibleness ofcertain genetic variations and thence sustain them—rather like the way our mindswill spot and highlight a word amongst a scattering of random letters. Thisbeing so, genetic changes that lead to some kind of sensible life-enhancingbehavior will tend to persist and have the opportunity to further evolve withinany gene pool. Because Nature represents a meaningful and ordered contextualsystem (in other words, it is intelligently configured), evolutionary events canunfold in response to that meaningful context. Indeed, the very tree of lifegerminated in accordance with this significantly configured context.The Importance of ContextTo get a firm handle on this highly salient notion concerning intelligentcontexts, consider that well-worn story of the monkey at the typewriter. We areasked to imagine this monkey typing feverishly away at random for ages and ages,most of the time producing gibberish. Eventually we can see how, by pure chance,the monkey manages to type some words or even a short meaningful sentence (inwhich case any grinning on the monkey’s part becomes suddenly apt). Now,although this story is meant to show how meaning can be generated from anonmeaningful system by pure chance (meaning coming out of nothing and forfree), this is patently not true. Indeed, if one can grasp why such reasoning isfalse, one will simultaneously grasp the point I have been driving at—namelythat Nature is an intelligently configured contextual system guaranteed to growthe tree of life by highlighting its sensibleness.In the monkey yarn, we do not get meaning out of nonmeaning. Far from it. First,we have two meaningful systems from the outset: the monkey and the typewriter.Second, and more important, it is the context of the human psyche that givesmeaning to the typed responses of the monkey. This means that one is not gettingmeaning out of thin air, but that there was a priori meaning present in thesystem of monkey, typewriter, and us-as-observer. It is precisely this a priorimeaning—in the form of an intelligent and patient observer—that serves tohighlight that tiny fraction of the monkey’s typed responses that make sense. Ifthere is no meaningful context surrounding the monkey and its typed output (thatis, no intelligent observer is present), then no meaning can be highlighted andthus nothing that the monkey types will ever make any sense.The same holds true for evolution. If Nature were not already a sensiblyconfigured system, if Nature were not highly organized in terms of its laws andits lawful logical relations, then organisms and DNA-writ structures would notmake any sense. That they do make such good sense and that more and more sensecan be made through organic evolution reveals the a priori intelligentlyconfigured context provided by Nature. As an all-surrounding context, Naturenotices and minds, as it were, what happens within it, in the same way we wouldnotice if a monkey typed something sensible. In this way, Nature selectssensible changes to genomes, those variations and modifications of DNA thatyield life-affirming behavior. If the reader can grasp this, the notion ofnatural intelligence—the ultra-smart quality of Nature—becomes self-evident, andeverything that we take for granted changes.Environmental AwarenessIt is apparent that Nature has an unfailing contextual capacity to continuallyselect smarter and smarter biological forms. Look at the evolution of thehominid brain, for instance. The remarkable evolution from cortex version 1.0to, say, cortex version 7.0 happened only because the environment continuallyand invariably selects genetic changes that enhance a brain’s ability to makesense of the intelligible information that the environment provides. Thus,environment and evolving organ (or evolving organism) are part of oneinterconnected fluidic system. This role of environmental context in cultivatingthe evolution of complex living things is unfortunately taken for granted bymost evolutionary thinkers. In other words, it is not usually remarked upon justhow much a role Nature, as an environment, plays in the evolutionary process. Itsurely did not have to be that way, for we can imagine a state of affairs inwhich Nature would not continually foster the evolution of complexity—in thesame way that we can imagine a monkey typing away at a typewriter for eternityand never ever making written sense because there is no context available withwhich to highlight any sense.It seems though that Nature is arranged in a way that literally demands that areal kind of self-stimulation occurs in which information—in the form ofgenotypes in this instance—continues to organize itself due to continualcontextual feedback from the environment, that is, the combined system oforganisms and the environment feeds back upon itself and provokes ever-moreevolutionary progress. In this way organisms can continually evolve and becomesmarter, because the environment surrounding them acts as the context thathighlights and sustains newly sensible structures and newly sensible behaviors.By making biological and behavioral sense within the larger context in whichthey are embedded, organisms can be selectively evolved. The point to bear inmind is that sense and meaning of one kind are clearly required in order toelicit further forms of sense and meaning. Only meaning can beget meaning; onlyintelligence can beget intelligence; only something smart can constructsomething else that is smart. The fabric of Nature is therefore smart throughout(some of these smart qualities were discussed in previous chapters and werereferred to as the Universal Computation).As a good example that demonstrates the role of the environment in elicitingsensible and ingenious biological structures, think of the shape of dolphins andsharks. Each species has evolved a similarly sleek body shape along withmusculature that affords swift movement underwater. Such creatures can moveextremely efficiently in water. What their bodies, musculature, and behavioralpatterns have done (through evolution) is to home in on, or gravitate toward,the lawful and sensible properties of water, these lawful and sensibleproperties acting as a sensible context. Because water is replete with varioussensible properties, these can be made sense of, or be reflected. The sleek bodyshape of dolphins and sharks and their precise techniques of swimming thereforereflect the presence of a sensibly ordered environment. If we concede thatdolphins and sharks embody impressive natural design, this is only becauseNature itself, serving as a context that invokes the design, also embodiesimpressive natural design. Order and intelligence are everywhere, inherent inboth the lawful behavior of the environment and in the organisms and biologicalbehaviors that evolve therein.Let’s return to the rapid evolution of the hominid brain from version 1.0 toversion 7.0. Each incremental increase in size and capacity (presumably derivedthrough mutation and variation) must have met with specific environmentalcircumstances with which to immediately highlight those improvements such that areproductive advantage was achieved. Each mutation in hominid brain size wastherefore nourished by a contextual set of environmental conditions to ensurethat its new capacity had an edge over nonmutated hominid brains. In otherwords, Nature was able to make sense, or highlight the sensibility, of thesemutational, variational changes in the hominid brain. If this were not so thenit is difficult to imagine why so many small changes in brain size were sorapidly selected for by the environment.One assumes that the cerebral capacity we humans have is a highly neatadaptation to living in the world. Indeed, if more and more refined methods ofsense-making are the stock and trade of natural selection, consciousness andlanguage are capacities that almost certainly had to evolve somewhere andsomewhen, as they are capacities that enable good sense to be made of theenvironment on a moment-by-moment basis (consciousness and language allow us to“swim” well through the world just as a fusiform shape allows dolphins to swimwell through water). And the only reason consciousness and language were able toevolve, the only way they manage to make sense of the world, is because Natureis already sensible and can be made sense of. This is most apparent whenthinking of language. Nouns, adjectives, and verbs exist in Nature—old leavesfall gracefully to the ground, for example. Even before we had language to speakabout old leaves falling to the ground, they still did. The language we possessmerely reflects the language-like property of Nature itself. This means, ineffect, that Nature is, and always has been, eminently sensible, and this isreflected within organisms through the “mirror” of bio-logic.What I am really driving at is that Nature can be viewed as a single system ofself-organizing intelligence. That’s the gist of it. Through the evolution oflife, Nature feeds back on itself and generates an ever-more refined reflectionof its inherent intelligence. In particular, this intelligence is reflectedthrough the language of DNA, which Nature edits so as to express precisely thosestructures, organs, and behaviors that make good sense in the larger context inwhich they are embedded (think of eyes, ears, lungs, livers, fur, seasonalmigration, bone structure, wing structure, light sensitivity, semipermeablemembranes, metabolic pathways, hibernation, and so forth). Not only are genomevariations and genetic mutations crucial for evolution, but the intelligentconfiguration of Nature must also play a key role—if not the main role—inhighlighting and nourishing the advantageous potential of a tiny fraction of themutants and variants whose altered genes are not deleterious. Eventually,nervous systems and brains endowed with consciousness were destined to emergesomewhere along the evolutionary line. This line happens to be the primate lineand our species, Homo sapiens. Although this creative capacity of Nature iscommonly considered to be a simple brute fact and not worth a second thought, itcan also be interpreted as evidence for the presence of natural intelligencethroughout the contextual fabric of the Universe.An Exquisite Unfolding PotentialThat some form of highly organized carbon-based life was always poised to emergeout of the Universe is a remarkable fact that seems to be peculiarly downplayedby mainstream science. I once remarked on this immanent aspect of life to auniversity philosopher. “Look,” I said eagerly. “Here’s this nucleic acid stuff,which, when put together in precise digital strings, codes for precise stringsof amino acids. And these cause precise proteins to form. And the proteinsintegrate to form fully functional organs more complex than computers. Why isthat? From whence cometh this astonishingly inventive capacity of Nature, thisremarkable computational precision? Why should Nature be endowed with such aninordinate amount of latent creative power?”Well, this academic chap thought little of it, declaring that the things humansinvent are just as much latent within “matter” as is life and that we do notmarvel at that. At the time I was unable to come up with a rejoinder to hiscareless dismissal. Now, however, it seems clear that his university salary wasundeserved in that moment, for most of our inventions are based on principlesalready expressed by natural intelligence. Airplanes were preceded by naturalbird and insect flight. Our electrical telecommunication systems were precededby the natural electrochemical communication occurring in nervous systems. Oursolar energy technology was preceded by natural photosynthesis. Our sonartechnology was preceded by natural echolocation in bats. Our nanotechnologymimics the nanotechnology first invented billions of years ago when life began.Our prototypical nuclear-fusion generators were preceded by natural stars. Ourinformation-processing computers were preceded by natural information-processingsystems of which the Universe is made. The list goes on. In fact, had Nature notprovided us with the above examples, we might never have been prompted todevelop our own technological equivalents (surely no one would ever haveconceived of flying were it not for the tangible presence of birds or wingedinsects). Not only has natural intelligence in one form or another taught us allwe know, but the evolutionary process is itself a manifestation of thisintelligence at work. What we are witness to here on Earth is the unfoldinggenius of Nature. The evolution of life is no less than a wondrous promise woveninto Nature and, over time, coordinated and delivered by Nature.Are We Smarter Than Nature?Despite the above reasoning, the notion that Nature represents a self-organizingintelligence working over immense time scales is an idea that, I am sure, manyof us will probably find hard to swallow (unless swallowed with a dose ofpsilocybin mushrooms!). And yet to assert that evolution is not an intelligentprocess is to rate the process that allowed this assertion to arise to be lesssmart than we are. In other words, over the course of three and a half billionyears the evolutionary process has managed to forge conscious human intelligence(the capacity of the human cortex) that is then able, if it so chooses, to denythat the evolutionary process is itself intelligent. Think about it. Can anonintelligent process really yield profound intelligence? Can we expect acomputer simulation of evolution to produce a smart virtual organism withoutfirst ensuring that the computer software is itself smartly designed? Or couldone of Conway’s Life games have yielded a virtual computer able to exhibitartificial intelligence without having first been set up in an extremelyintelligent way? Can we really explain all and everything without recourse toinvoking intelligently configured contexts?Clearly, the average neo-Darwinist alleges that the evolutionary process is notintelligent. Yet life is undeniably more complex, organized, integrated, andsmart than we can possibly grasp. Indeed, science, especially biological andgenetic science, is still coming to grips with the elaborate complexity ofliving systems. It seems that the more closely science examines life, the moreingenious life turns out to be, as if there is little that evolution cannotachieve. Evolution through natural selection undoubtedly happens, yet how weinterpret the meaning of natural is not necessarily a foregone conclusion. Tosuggest that natural selection represents a manifestation of naturalintelligence is merely a new way of evaluating the reality of evolution in thelight of contextual considerations. No new supernatural mechanism is beinginvoked—rather we are reinterpreting and reappraising the facts at hand.Have We Stolen Nature’s Glory?Scientific discoveries, whether in biology, chemistry, neuropsychology, orphysics, invariably point to the ingenuity of Nature. Every university sciencedepartment in the world owes its existence to the smartness of Nature—asmartness that science merely reflects. Almost every scientific researcher,almost every doctoral student is sailing on a sea of sensible knowledge providedby Nature. Whether a geneticist marveling over replicating mile-long, compactstrands of DNA, a botanist spellbound by bee-mimicking orchids, or anentomologist fascinated by fungus-cultivating ant colonies—all are caught up inthe engineering finesse wrought by Nature over billions of years.Similarly, almost every science book available owes its existence to Nature’sintelligent manipulations. Science is therefore to be understood as an attemptto mirror or reflect the intelligence of Nature in a worded form. And yetwhatever facet of Nature we care to investigate, whether this be the intricatestructure of a single cell, the elaborate grip of the Venus flytrap, or thedelicate balancing mechanism of the inner ear, science is always committed toaccounting for such phenomena as being no more than the end products of anatural but purposeless process, a process that just happens to be extremelyconstructive and that just happens to arise because the contextual laws ofNature just happen to allow interesting evolutionary events to unfold at sometime and in some place. Things just tend to happen that way. And a lucky thingit is, too, for if Nature did not possess intelligible and sensible contextualqualities, then the scientists would be out of work and out of life.However, it does not matter what science comes across in its pursuits, for nomatter how smart some animal, plant, or biological process is, it can always bereduced to a “mere” aspect of natural selection, where natural means only “theway things tend to happen.” If we were to discover, say, some new plant thatyielded a massive fruit out of which popped an organic flying machine completewith a steering wheel and a comfy seat, then two things would probably happen.First, scientists would immediately account for the machine in terms of “mere”natural selection by inferring that the fruit was a potentially advantageousadaptation. Second, the machines would be seized upon by people and exploited tothe hilt without a second thought as to the nature of the process that led tothem. In no time at all, both scientists and the lay community would becompletely used to this useful new production of Nature. It would have becomeyet another “mere” incident of the natural world.The imagined state of affairs above parodies the often-blithe attitude of thescience community toward the nifty creative processes exhibited by Nature. Allorganisms, no matter how intricate, no matter how refined and sophisticated, nomatter how well adapted, are “merely” the products of a blind process that justhappens to produce smart and enduring structures over vast spans of time. Brainscertainly convey intelligently driven processes, but not so Nature, we are told.Yet natural selection is itself a process, and since it is the most stunning andsuccessful information-gaining process we know of, then it can justifiably bedeemed an intelligent process.Perhaps Nature should be awarded Nobel Prizes and not the scientists whodiscover Nature’s smart mechanisms and pathways. If a scientist begins a learneddiscussion about the double-helix structure of DNA and the genetic code, wemight well be taken aback by his or her grasp of the subject matter. We wouldsay that someone who understands the complexities of DNA is very intelligent anddeserving perhaps of prestige, respect, and admiration. Yet he or she is inactuality merely reflecting the creative ingenuity of Nature. Thus, it is thediscoveries of science that should be described with a liberal sprinkling of thepopular adjective mere and not the actual processes that science documents.Nature is ultrasmart, and it is we who “merely” reflect that fact.Similarly, terribly thick textbooks detail the physical and mathematicalprocesses underlying cosmological phenomena like star formation and supernovae.Again, the neat equations and so on that govern precisely these phenomena are ina real sense written by Nature. Consider also the text in a leather-bound bookabout the highly organized microstructure of paper and leather—the integratedand mathematically precise atomic configurations of carbon and other organicelements of which leather and paper consist. You would certainly require a fairdegree of intelligence to really understand such a book. But surely the bookitself (the actual paper and leather) is more representative of intelligentlyconstructed units of information than the text it carries? Science serves onlyto reflect the intelligent structures already “out there” in reality.The living proof of natural intelligence is everywhere around us and inside us.Our bodies are spun from it. The text found in a biology book detailing thefantastic inner wisdom of, say, the immune system, is merely a reflection in theformal system of words of the formal system that we call biology. Both areintelligible, and a hallmark of intelligent systems is precisely theirintelligibility. This means that biological systems and their evolution can beregarded as a manifestation of natural intelligence. Thus, NASA’s hubristic SETIprogram in which communicatory cries are broadcast out into space reveals adistinct failure to look closer to home, for it is Nature in its totality thatis the highly advanced intelligence we are so keenly interested in locating.Ah, but Can Nature Pass an IQ Test?If we find it difficult to accept that Nature is intelligent, then perhaps thisrepresents a too-limited view of what constitutes intelligence. Or maybe weconfuse intelligence with consciousness. In any case, don’t be fooled intothinking that intelligence is something to be measured solely by IQ tests. Theseare mere inventions of the psychologist, designed to tap specific aspects ofintelligence. In its strictest sense, intelligence means “the ability to learnand to understand.” This definition implies the capacity to increase informationsuch that sense is made and uncertainty is reduced. If you use intelligence, youcan work things out, make sense of things, and thereby increase your internalstate of knowledge. Intelligent processes foster the integration of moreinformation. In my book Darwin’s Unfinished Business, I discuss this at length.The absorption of information, the storing of information, and the ability tolearn from that information are, I contend, the principal ingredients ofintelligence. Indeed, they are precisely the sort of thing that we do so welland that the robots of AI engineers attempt to do. Our senses continually takein information about the environment, our brains store this information, andthen we use the information to learn more and more about the environment. Theseare all processes, not static things. Bearing this in mind, it should beapparent that the end result of these three processes working in combination isintelligence. Intelligence is all these processes combined into one, the termintelligence being a convenient way of explaining their combined action. Sointelligence is definitely not a thing like a table is a thing. Nor is it merelyan attribute. It’s more of a process, moreover a process concerned withinformation and the constructive manipulation of information. The science of AIis all about substantiating this process in robotic form, or “in silico,” assome AI scientists call it.3 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts45]Evolution is precisely an information-gaining process and can be considered aform of natural learning. As information is built up within the biosphere andits gene pools, uncertainty is reduced, the result being specific organisms withspecific behaviors and specific relations to the environment. The naturalintelligence that is life has learned to express itself through the language ofDNA, has learned to utilize the sun’s energy through photosynthesis, has learnedto fly through wings, has learned to breathe, sleep, dream, think, communicate,reproduce, recycle, and so on. The evolution of the tree of life thereforerepresents a natural learning process that is inscribed in DNA and that emergesin response to an environmental context that serves to elicit the learning.Natural Intelligence Is EverywhereAlthough natural intelligence becomes apparent everywhere we care to look in thenatural world, the modern version of Homo sapiens seems to miss it. If, say, wewere to venture into a desert and stumble across some strange, whirring,solar-powered machine that transforms sand into circuit boards so that it canreplicate itself, repair itself, and even reproduce, then we would certainlytake notice and infer that the machine embodies some measure of artificialintelligence. Yet if we later stumble across a hardy cactus quietly convertingsunlight into usable energy and constructing reproductive organs that cunninglylure insects into transferring its pollen, then we immediately infer it to be“merely” the result of natural selection and not of intelligence. No doubt wewould pass over the cactus and return to the ostensibly more interestingmanufactured machine. To date, most scientists stubbornly refuse to equate theprocess of evolution with intelligent information processing, despite the factthat the most complex things we know of are living organisms.Recall Mr. von Neumann. He was considered a highly intelligent man because,among other things, he showed that in principle, self-replicating machines couldbe built. Von Neumann was himself a replicating machine, albeit of the organickind. Why should he be considered intelligent while the process that generatedhim is not? Given the fact that, like us, von Neumann was built of a hundredtrillion cells tightly woven into a triumph of organic engineering, the case fornatural intelligence becomes even more conspicuous. Nothing von Neumann did cameanywhere near matching the genius of evolution itself. Only the human ego candeny this. And yet the human ego is itself dependent in some way on the humancortex for its existence. And we already know how brilliantly Nature hasdesigned the cortex.Let us also consider photosynthesis a tad more closely, embodied as it is in thegreen film covering the Earth. Without this downplayed biomolecular wizardry(which has yet to be technologically mirrored in a globally viablecost-effective way) there would be little life at all, for almost all life isbased on this ultrasmart process. Because photons (of which light consists)behave sensibly and have sensible energetic properties, biologicalphotosynthesis can evolve in response to this (just as dolphin biology and sharkbiology have evolved in response to the sensible properties of water). Yet it iseasy to play the imagination game and hypothesize a reality in which organicchemicals could not in any way form themselves into neat, energy-utilizingorganisms. For life to flourish it had to reside as an immanent potential withinorganic chemistry, and the context of the Universe at large had to be conduciveto eliciting such a potential right down to the formation of suns thateventually go supernova. In short, I would argue that it is valid for us towonder why reality is so amenable to the process of biological evolution, justas it is valid to ask why the Universe is intelligible.Traditional Darwinism cannot adequately answer these questions. It can onlyshrug and state with nonchalance that Nature just happens to be that way, thatNature has been, well, lucky—lucky in the sense that it eventually brought forthconscious brains able to grasp the processes that led to conscious brains.However, if we conceive of evolution as the ongoing expression of a naturalintelligence, we can connect it to those other fortunate aspects of the realityprocess that have allowed interesting things to happen in the Universe.Eventually we can discern that Nature is, at heart, a creatively intelligentsystem. Don’t forget, I am not implying some new phenomenon here or introducingsomething supernatural; rather, I am suggesting that overall, in its entirety,Nature is a smart system and that biological evolution is a direct consequenceof this. Such a view, such a new angle through which to conceive reality, is notmerely a case of words, but an attempt to redefine our place within Nature andto reappraise the significance and meaning of our conscious existence.Unnatural BiasI think there are three principal reasons why evolution is not generally viewedas an intelligent process. First, intelligence often has connotations ofconsciousness, and many of us would doubtless find it hard to attributeconsciousness to Nature (at least akin to the kind of consciousness we have).Second, evolution happens over lengthy time spans, as opposed to the relativelyshort time spans over which human intelligence operates. Third, we are aterribly proud and arrogant species that likes to imagine that we ourselves arethe smartest thing on two legs. Intelligence belongs primarily to us and not tothe more abstract systems of which we are a part (I presume that this outlook isconnected to the human ego, as alluded to earlier).However, intelligence, when understood as a process, does not necessarily entailconsciousness (intelligence can also be unconscious), nor does it have to belimited in its method or time span, nor should it necessarily be confined tobrains alone. If intelligence is tied up with information-gaining processes andlearning, then clearly evolution is natural intelligence at work. Life on Earth,in all its manifold organismic glory, has ably learned how to live, cope, andbehave sensibly—that is, life has mastered the subtle art of sustainability. Theonly real difference between this kind of natural acumen and human acumen is inmagnitude and success.Reductive science does not recognize natural intelligence because reductivescience looks to isolated entities and attempts to seek explanations for theirexistence on lower levels. To glimpse natural intelligence is to view the largersystem of which the components are a part. This larger system is, ultimately,the entire Universe, a specifically configured backdrop that provides theessential conditions necessary to promote the digital computational procedurethat is evolution. These essential conditions are things like the sensible flowof energy throughout the Universe; the convenient formation and enduringpresence of suns; the facilitated formation of DNA, with its convenientlyplastic and linguistic nature; the continual presence of factors thatconveniently induce DNA to vary and mutate; and, most important of all perhaps,the instructive nature of the environment that ensures DNA can be expressed inever-more sophisticated ways. If we contemplate in large-scale holistic terms,then natural intelligence emerges. Darwin’s groundbreaking legacy thereforeresides in his discovery of the methodology of natural intelligence.Superfluous Icing on the Darwinian Cake?Some might object here and claim that to infer that evolution represents anintelligent process is to introduce superfluous and scurrilous gossip-makingbaggage into what is already a sufficient theory. In other words, why infernatural intelligence when it is not absolutely necessary to use such terminologyfor our understanding of the mechanisms by which evolution proceeds? Well, thismight be true, yet to refuse to elaborate on evolutionary theory is to imposelimitations on our understanding, especially if we desire a holistic andmetaphysically satisfying view of Nature. Perhaps this is why there have been somany attempts to do away with Darwin’s theory, not because it is wrong butbecause there is some conceptual element missing, an element that can moreproperly capture and appreciate the amazing power of evolution.As far as I can see, if we don’t infer that Nature is smart, we can’t explainwhy exactly Nature should allow, and indeed encourage, biological evolution.Why, for instance, should the emergence of self-replicating, self-repairing DNAbe an inevitable consequence of the laws of Nature? Why does DNA havelanguage-like properties that can be expressed through proteins? Why aremillions of proteins able to effortlessly fold into exquisite organismicpatterns? Why, through genetic variation, is life continually able to forgesolutions to various problems? How come there is a biological way forward mostof the time? Why are DNA and genes so plastic and flexible? Why, indeed, isNature made of such elegantly versatile, Lego-like components? And why shouldsomething as amazing as consciousness eventually be facilitated by life? Thequestions go on. The fortuitously creative brute facts mount up. The smartself-organizational properties of Nature abound. Something important is clearlyhappening everywhere.The Ultrasmart Complexity of OrganismsAllow me to reiterate a previous reiteration: your own self-repairing body, yourvisual system processing these words, your autonomic breathing system andautonomic digestive system—all are far more smart than any manufactured computeror fabricated device currently in existence (especially when one considers howthe body’s various functions are integrated into a coherent and enduring unity).Perhaps you are familiar with some latest piece of computer software, somebrand-new nifty program embodied in computer code. You will certainly concedethat this code is smart. Yet reflect on the huge store of digital DNA codingetched into almost every one of your many trillions of body cells and you willrealize that human-derived programs pale in the face of those written by Nature.This becomes more apparent if we bear in mind that the DNA is essentially thesame in all our cells, whether liver cells, lung cells, skin cells, or braincells. Yet somehow that self-same information can be expressed in many differentways. The final orchestrated result—a living organism—is so wonderfully complexas to defy a complete understanding.Somewhat paradoxically, I would suggest that it is precisely because Nature isso very, very smart that we do not acknowledge it. Biological processes, in themain, are so perfected in their natural execution that we fail to comprehendjust how much complexity is involved (recall my detailed discussion of neuronalevents, for instance). It is only when biology goes wrong that we suddenlybecome aware of just how ingenious it usually is in its operation. And yet, moreoften than not, we do not awake in the morning with a broken eye, a crashedmemory module, a faulty connection in our ear, or an intermittent lung. Unlikeour machines, our nervous systems do not tend to blow a fuse or sufferincongruous shutdowns. Thus, for the most part we may take life for granted andfail to grasp the very real miracle of our conscious organic existence.Similarly, if computers were so perfectly designed that people were able toutilize them for a thousand years without one single breakdown, we would soonlose sight of just how smartly they were designed. We would become completelyaccustomed to computers and take them for granted without a thought as to theirintelligently designed infrastructure. However, should malfunctions begin tooccur, we would suddenly wake up to their underlying contrived functionality.Returning to human biological processes, they are generally so impeccable thatthey take care of themselves, which is to say that Nature is a pretty smoothoperator. For most of us, we grow from babies to adults faultlessly, yet themyriad steps in this morphological feat are absurdly sophisticated. Think of acouple of identical twins and the amount of steps involved in turning them frommicroscopic single-celled entities into macroscopic trillion-celled entities.Yet after all that incomprehensibly complicated development, they both lookexactly the same!Such fine biological precision is a creative manifestation of what I am callingnatural intelligence—a naturally smart process that has yielded as part of itsoutput we beings endowed with consciousness, a process moreover that has beenoperating over an immense stretch of time. Yet just because theinformation-gaining evolutionary process that led to you and I took billions ofyears does not mean that it is nonintelligent, as we have been led to believe.To surmise that high intelligence exists only in our species is to be blind toboth the natural intelligence that facilitated evolution and the naturalintelligence embodied in all biological systems.We have arrived back at the idea of the Universal Computation (or cosmic seedeven), for it would appear that all the information necessary to construct suns,planets, molecules, amino acids, cells, microorganisms, plants, animals, andconscious brains was somehow written into primeval Nature, lying dormant as itwere until the right conditions had developed somewhere and somewhen in whichthis information could be “read out.” This is a breathtaking idea, and if itshould generate a small gasp of wonder, this is but nothing compared to the awegenerated by entheogens like the psilocybin mushroom, an awe that is intimatelyconnected to realizations of our potential significance, as conscious agents, inthe reality process.Nature thus emerges as being incredibly smart as well as deadly, and I can closethis chapter with an apt quote by Einstein, this time pertaining to thereverence felt by at least some scientists toward the Universe with which weinterface. Einstein openly notes that this emotion “takes the form of arapturous amazement at the harmony of natural law, which reveals an intelligenceof such superiority that, compared with it, all the systematic thinking andacting of human beings is an utterly insignificant reflection.”4[../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts46]I almost second that emotion. Human thinking might not be an “insignificantreflection” at all. Far from it. Indeed, I presume that if we divine naturalintelligence, acknowledge it, and really feel it, then this represents a highlyrefined reflection of that intelligence. Which implies that such acortex-embodied reflection is of functional import, facilitating a sort ofself-realization factor of natural intelligence as it were. We explore theseissues in the next chapter."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/9781594779374_002.jpg]T E NA Neo-Shamanic ClimaxAs we have seen, the impressive fine-tuning of Nature is most clearly indicatedin the evolutionary process that Nature has facilitated here upon the Earth.Over some three and a half billion years, our planet has transformed itself froma lifeless mass of rock into a veritable metabolizing organic matrix in whichcountless elegantly patterned organisms swarm about the Earth’s surface, eachorganism an informational expression of natural intelligence. Yet, like the hourhand of a clock, scientists have failed to discern the context-drivenintelligence of evolution, claiming instead that evolution is essentially a dumband mindless process. But this can only be a subjective inference likely drawnaccording to the perceived duration over which evolution manifests, a durationso great that the intelligence operating over such a span remains all butinvisible. If we instead imagine viewing a time-lapse film of the biospherewherein three and a half billion years of information-gaining evolution arecompressed into but one intense second, then modern electronic human culture andhuman consciousness explode instantaneously into existence, bursting forth outof the Earth’s ocean of elemental constituents. This awesome pattern ofself-organization can be no mere accident. To those who would still scoff atthis assertion, I can only ask them this: If the aforementioned capacity of theUniverse does not suggest a great intelligence at work, then what sort ofUniverse would?Notwithstanding sullen detractors, if we embrace our River of Life metaphor, thetotality of life represents the thrust of an intelligent process of informationintegration, and I argue that this is the essence of reality, the essence of theprocess that bred and killed Einstein and that controls our destiny also.Because all the information needed to support confluential patterning is etchedinto the “software” of the Universe, life and the emergence of consciousness canbe viewed as a kind of translation whereby the code or meaning inherent inreality is read out over time. Somewhere within the reality process a biospherehad to form, since it was coded for in the lawful contextual fabric of theUniverse. And within such a biosphere—of which there may be countless millionsin the Universe—evolution was destined at some time to produce nervous systemsand, eventually, brains capable of embodying consciousness. Patterns foreverfalling naturally into place like some cosmic jigsaw.The conscious aspect of Homo sapiens thus resolves itself as a potent expressionof the latest and most reflective form of information integration to emerge outof Nature—reflective because our kind is able to reflect upon how we came to be.In a real way, the human cortex is a biologically wrought mirror able to catchthe true face of Nature upon its refined surface.As with all other fluidic patterns of information, consciousness really waspoised to materialize, its emergence dependent, like everything else, on thelaws and forces of Nature along with prevailing contextual conditions. And sohere we stand, atop the jungle and atop the technology we have created, our gazenow set on the expanding intelligible cosmos. Each human psyche, imbued withmeaning from the larger context in which it has arisen, is able to wonder at themystery of it all and even to glimpse the orchestrating intelligence in whosehands we are like transformed clay. In an instant of cosmic time, consciousnesshas arisen out of physics, chemistry, and biology, a living mirror able toreflect the intelligent forces that so engendered it.Forecasting the FutureThe evolution of life on Earth, the gradual elaboration of the biosphere, andthe emergence of conscious human culture strongly suggest that we are inside amost interesting and creative part of the Universe. It is as if one of themightiest currents within the River of Life were flowing around us right hereand right now, focused within our modern electronic culture. Indeed, if thecreative center of the Universe is the place where the most elaborate kinds ofinformation integration are taking hold, then we are surely in or near thecenter. Or at least we are amid one of the focal points of natural intelligence.The amount of information being organized in one way or another all around us isso dense that one can feel it. Actively flowing information bombards us at everyturn as it seeks resolution. Early twenty-first century culture with its globalcyberspatial network is like some effervescent protoplasm exuded by thebiosphere as it seeks to attain cohesion and stability at some higher level oforganization.Those scientists who diligently propound the myth that we are mere bystanders ona speck of dust remote from the heart of the Universe clearly do the phenomenaof life and consciousness a major disservice. As far as we know, in terms ofinformational activity, the existence of humanity (seven billion potentiallyinterconnected minds) is far and away more complex and intriguing than anythingelse in the known Universe. The Earth’s biosphere, in its totality including allof human culture, is surely the place to be.If reality is indeed a rushing river of integrating information, it might wellbe destined to meet some final organized form or pattern. Actually, this wouldappear to be an inescapable implication if my reasoning so far is correct. Forif the evolution of organic life and human consciousness represents theinexorable unfolding of a potential woven into the fabric of Nature, then whatfurther potential is yet to be expressed? If natural intelligence is as powerfulas I suspect, there absolutely must be some final point or solution to itsprodigious endeavors.To give the reader a taste of such a scenario, consider the following thoughtexperiment. Geneticists tell us that a fair proportion of the DNA found in allorganisms serves some as yet unknown function. On a worldwide scale, the totalamount of this so-called junk DNA must be immense. But what if it were a form oflatent information that was set to go into action only when environmentalcircumstances were in a particular state? What if the biosphere suddenly assumeda context to which this globally distributed DNA was tuned? Anything mighthappen. All organisms might suddenly mutate and forge themselves anew. Thepossibilities are endless since DNA is so rich in its capacity to organizechemical and biological processes. Perhaps the reader can think of somealternative possibility.I offer such wild speculation not because I believe it to be true, but becauseit highlights, in principle, how reality as we know it might well be coded toproduce some climactic output at some latter stage of its evolutionaryprogression. Equally plausible is the idea that our interconnected computertechnology might spawn some new level of informational cohesion—a kind ofvirtual dimension into which the agency of human consciousness can betransferred. In point of fact, as I previously remarked, through the rise oftelecommunications and computing technology, the Earth does seems to be wiringitself up into an integrated digital network, a bioelectronic entity in whichwidely dispersed informational systems like the human psyche can instantlycommunicate with one another across the globe. This magical technology, similaras it is to the communicational activity of the synapsing neuronal brain, isclearly evolving at an unprecedented rate, and the eventual emergence of a more“tangible” cyberspatial dimension of some kind seems assured. Indeed, judging bythe boom in media speculation about the near future of computing systems alongwith the escalating popularity of Internet-enabled Wi-Fi phones, it would appearthat a fully immersive cyberspace of one sort or another is within reach.What this kind of rife pop divination reveals is just how forcibly the futurenow looms upon us. It is as if we were moving ever more rapidly toward some newtechnological breakthrough involving information integration that will transformour culture, a transformation not only inevitable but whose shadow is alreadyupon us, stirring us into prophetic thinking. For when else in our history hasthere been so much concentrated speculation about the very near future? More tothe point, if some unimaginable fully integrated state were soon to be reached,whether mediated through networked computers or some other orchestrationalmedium, then clearly Nature has always been poised to deliver such an output.Maybe this could be considered the ultimate purpose of natural intelligence (orat least part of it), for it would represent the translated rebirth of theOther, the blossoming of the biosphere, a final planetary condition that Naturehas determined in some way to achieve.Most of us, however, are content to allow ourselves to be drawn almost passivelyalong within the River of Life. We build sturdy rafts made of material goods andsocial status. We surround ourselves with items that our culture injects withvalue, and these are what keep us afloat. And yet our rafts, no matter howrobustly they may be constructed and no matter how much wealth they contain,will eventually be destroyed, eaten up by the process in which they are sweptalong. No matter how long we try to prolong it, the time allotted to our DNA isfinite. We are digitally programmed by natural intelligence to grow old and die,just as surely as we are built to grow through puberty and reproduce. We arepatterns of information that swirl into ordered existence, only to break up inthe wink of a cosmic eye. It’s a good reason to think more carefully about ourpersonal relationship with the river and where it is headed, for then we mightdiscern our proper place within the integrative flow.Near the River’s EndWe are a conscious species riding on the crest of an intelligent wave, and ourcollective knowledge represents a kind of growing certainty about the Universe.As this certainty (or information) continues to increase, we will graduallyrealize exactly why we have evolved. The intelligence of Nature is thus becomingfully reflected through human consciousness and in the knowledge systems of ourculture. This really is suggestive of a kind of birth. The creative intelligence“running” the Universe is in the process of radically transforming itself intohuman culture and into human consciousness, just as a caterpillar radicallytransforms itself into a butterfly. Natural intelligence is therefore undergoingprotean metamorphosis through the process of evolution. As information continuesto build up and self-organize within the biosphere, the biospherical systembecomes more informed by the natural intelligence that constructed it. If thisis so, then the purpose of life and mind might well be to embody a new form ofthe natural intelligence that commanded life and mind to arise in the firstplace.Such a possibility is clearly similar to Fred Hoyle’s speculations. However, Ido not believe that natural intelligence is itself descended from some previousform of intelligence. What I suspect is that the entire Universe—Nature and allits information—is a kind of Will (what the spiritual teacher G. I. Gurdjieffcalled the Will of the Absolute) or Mind. After all, we know for sure that thehuman brain embodies both mind and will. So if the brain can have twoaspects—physical and mindful—then why can’t the Universe? In any case, I amcertain that intelligence is a fundamental property of Nature, just asfundamental as the forces of Nature. Indeed, the various forces of Nature can beunderstood as a primary expression of natural intelligence, its most basicmanifestation as it were. And so after fourteen billion years of reality inwhich the intent of natural intelligence has been steadily realized,consciousness has now emerged that can grasp the curiously profound source ofits arising.It is as if information, like energy, cannot be destroyed, and that theinformation content of reality, which remains constant, is in the process ofreforming itself from moment to moment. If we think of a computer program ableto take as input an image and smoothly morph that image into another image (ortranslate text from one language into another), then the reality process aroundus can similarly be viewed as a fourteen-billion-year-long translation of theOther from one language-like form into another. That translation will becomplete at some point in the future. The felt experience of the Other maytherefore represent the process whereby consciousness serves to become theOther. Again, this suggests a kind of birth, albeit of an awesome kind. Itsounds unbelievable, yet if we are pressed to provide a metaphysical explanationfor our ultrasmart Universe, then I believe that ideas such as these must benear to the mark.The Omega PointOne mystic who anticipated such ideas was the eminent Jesuit priest andpalaeontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, who was born in 1881 and died in1955. Unlike many other Christian thinkers, knowledge of the evolutionaryprocess actually increased Teilhard’s faith. Indeed, this explains hisscientific interest in fossils and evolution (and, I might add, hisexcommunication by his religious superiors).Teilhard believed that evolution was a purposeful process that would reach aclimax at some time in the future, this point representing a kind of totallyintegrated state of life. He called it the Omega Point. This perfect futurestate was also thought by Teilhard to somehow send influences back in time, asthough the Omega Point is an eternal sun able to shine its light upon thefour-dimensional surface of human history.Although Teilhard’s thinking was deeply mystical, some of his work was respectedby a number of traditional evolutionary theorists, most notably the biologistJulian Huxley. However, for most hard-nosed scientists who chance uponTeilhard’s work, he remains no more than a mystic dreamer, a refined P. K.Dicksian soul whose ideology is basically unfit for serious consideration.Unless, that is, one has repeatedly experienced the numinous presence of theOther, in which case his ideas become rather alluring.In The Future of Man, Teilhard writes about the Omega Point in the followingrather poetical way:Let us suppose that from this universal centre, this Omega point, thereconstantly emanate radiations hitherto only perceptible to those persons whom wecall ‘mystics’. Let us further imagine that, as the sensibility or response tomysticism of the human race increases with planetisation [the unification ofhumanity], the awareness of Omega becomes so widespread as to warm the earthpsychically while physically it is growing cold. Is it not conceivable thatMankind, at the end of its totalisation, its folding-in upon itself, may reach acritical level of maturity where, leaving Earth and stars to lapse slowly backinto the dwindling mass of primordial energy, it will detach itself from thisplanet and join the one true, irreversible essence of things, the Omega point? Aphenomenon perhaps outwardly akin to death: but in reality a simplemetamorphosis and arrival at the supreme synthesis.1[../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts47]Teilhard’s mention of a cooling Earth was probably a response to the growingrealization at the time he wrote the book that the Universe appeared to be“running down” due to the dreaded second law of thermodynamics. This revered lawstates, in no uncertain terms, that the Universe is “wilting” and faces aheat-death extinction. All of the Universe’s energy, it is said, will eventuallybe converted into a meaningless expanse of useless heat. Now, that’s a gloomythought for sure and a dangerous weapon in the hands of our archetypal reductivescientist, who might begin to prod us with it even now. However, according toour reasoning, the Universe must have surely required such dynamics in order tofunction in the way it has. In any case, evolution circumvents this running-downtendency by building dissipative structures—metabolizing organisms—to convertenergy into a usable form. Although closed systems do run down and do eventuallyreach equilibrium (a boring state in which nothing of interest happens), opensystems like the biosphere are able to build up order (courtesy of our generoussun, which radiates energy as it runs down) by giving off disorder (likeinfrared heat radiation) into space. In this way, natural intelligence hasbypassed the specter of the second law of thermodynamics, and informationintegration through evolution has taken hold. Or perhaps it would be moreaccurate to say that naturally intelligent laws have engineered a specificenergy flow, or energy current, to the Universe that life must continually“swim” against in order to develop and strengthen itself as it “returns to thesource.”When Teilhard wrote about the Omega Point, he was probably less aware than weare today that the laws of Nature are highly specific and conducive to life.Hence he saw the second law of thermodynamics as a threat to life (which itisn’t, because life taps into, and makes use of, the “downward” flow of energy),but foresaw that life would reach the Omega Point, just in the nick of time asit were, before the Universe ran down, or at least our poor sun ran down. Inother words, he located the Omega Point far, far ahead in time. But, as we haveseen, science has now reached the stage where it can appreciate not only thecomputational quality of reality, but also its fine-tuning. In my mind, this isstrong evidence that we are in the “good hands” of the Other, and, moresignificant, that the Omega Point might be nearer than Teilhard supposed. Ofcourse, it is preferable to think of such an event as being near as opposed tofar away. In any event, with the growth in psychedelic epistemology initiated inthe 1950s and 1960s, and with the current burgeoning interest in organicentheogens like the psilocybin mushroom and ayahuasca, it is conceivable thatthe illuminations caused by the Omega Point are on the increase. This suggeststhat we are indeed moving ever nearer to this climactic point.The End of the World as We Know ItNot surprisingly, Terence McKenna echoed the mystical claims made by Teilhard.In the 1990s, McKenna assumed the unenviable role of psilocybinetic prophet byconsistently claiming that human history will be utterly transformed in lateDecember 2012. This date derived from his mathematical “fractal theory of time,”which views time as a cyclical patterning process involving a continual“ingression of novelty” and which also implies a definite culmination point. Thedate also coincides with the mysterious end date of the Mayan calendar,according to which a life cycle of some new kind will commence (this Mayanend-of-time prophesy was apparently not known to McKenna when he first developedhis theory).At this time, so said McKenna, the full purpose of reality will become manifestas information integration, or the ingression of novelty as he called it,reaches its zenith. There lies the “transcendental object,” the eschaton, which,like Teilhard’s Omega Point, casts reflections of itself into the past,reflections that inspire and illuminate saints, mystics, and the minds ofvisionary shamans. Also in line with Teilhard’s Omega Point, McKenna suggestedthat this future state of transcendence somehow exists now, or in eternity, andthat it is toward this state that we and the reality process are beinginexorably drawn. One can imagine the future state to be like a magnet, that theemergence of life and consciousness is akin to the process whereby iron filingsassume structural alignment according to the nearness of a magnetizinginfluence. Indeed, all of Nature’s fortuitous self-organizationalproperties—like the emergence of the genetic code, for example—can been be seenas deriving from some future “magnetically charged” state that “pulls” theseproperties into being.In terms of the Universal Computation idea we have been entertaining, the OmegaPoint (whenever it might occur) would represent the final output state or fullrebirth of the Other within the biospherical system. The willed metamorphosiswould be complete. The universal code will be fully expressed, with allinformation, all knowledge, achieving a state of coalescence. The Other, naturalintelligence, will have completed its translation from one unified state ofbeing into another.McKenna also used the term attractor to describe this final eschatological statethat life is eventually destined to reach. An attractor is a kind of abstractfinal state toward which physical systems are drawn. In the case of a swingingpendulum encountering friction, the attractor is the state of the system inwhich the pendulum is at rest. Regardless of the starting position, the pendulumalways ends up in the attractor state. Likewise, in the case of chess, theattractor is the state of checkmate toward which the game invariably progresses.Attractors are thus inherent in various systems and are akin to the metaphoricalmagnet I previously described.In terms of the Universe at large, it could be argued that the attractor towardwhich it is being inexorably drawn is a kind of “big crunch,” whereby theUniverse collapses into an almighty singularity due to the effects of gravity.However, we can also view the attractor not as a super-concentration of“matter,” but as an integrated state of information or meaning. When humanconsciousness has succeeded in realizing its true role within reality, and whenthe Other has fully transformed itself within the collective psyche, then thiswill represent an attractor of the reality process. At this point, Nature willhave made maximum sense of itself.If we posit an attractor, we should also bear in mind that the nearer it is, themore marked and pronounced will the processes of self-organization be. Thissituation might explain recent and unusually rapid forms of evolution like thatof the hominid cortex, as well as the subsequent speedy evolution of humanculture and the more recent yearly evolution of digital technology. Dwelling onthis, one automatically thinks of a spiral process, or self-tightening gyre, inwhich Nature is frantically assuming a state through which more and moreinformation integration can take hold. Perhaps the end point of any biosphere isa kind of “local singularity,” alike in nature to the assumed singularity fromwhich the Universe sprung, a state of informational unification, although thistime embodied in a planetwide shared experience.If such a fantastic phenomenon were to actually realize itself sometime in thenear future, it would surely have to be preceded by a tremendous surge ofinformation heralding the event. I do not mean angels blowing trumpets, butrather that scientists ought to make new discoveries that indicate the smartnessof Nature. Or, if the paradigm of a naturally intelligent reality process wereto be favored and explored in more depth, it would mean a reinterpretation ofthe data already amassed through science, and this might further highlight ourunique position within the evolution of the cosmos. Alternatively, some newtechnological innovation or natural phenomenon might serve to make everyone moreconscious of the interconnectedness of the biosphere, particularly the billionsof minds that operate therein. This could then set the stage for synchronizedglobal behavior and the dawn of a new value system and a new humanity. Eitherway, if the evolutionary process is indeed smart and destined to “conclude” insome way according to an inherent code, then it will simply have to proceed inthe same way that an organism grows. Natural intelligence cannot be stopped; itcan only be observed and appreciated while in action.That we can experience the Other by ingesting psilocybin or by contemplating theintelligent properties of Nature indicates that something is indeed emergingwithin the collective human psyche, that some profoundly significant coherencylies beyond the chaos of secular fragmented reality. Or perhaps the Other hasbeen dormant, as though asleep, hibernating as it were, only to gradually awakenthrough the vehicle of consciousness, which it has prepared for in advance.I am the first to concede that much, if not more, mystery remains. But at leastthe mystery of our being has been more clearly defined. And at least we knowwhere to look should we want to explore Nature more deeply than a casual glanceallows. When one has encountered the Other through the visionary effects of astrong dose of psilocybin mushrooms, it becomes quite evident that, whatever theOther’s ultimate intent, consciousness is an essential part of the plan.Our Role on the Earth RockCultural conditions are ripe for a fresh look at Nature, which I consider to bean ultrasmart system. By so doing, the context in which we act out our livesbecomes somewhat altered (another feedback effect). If we conceive of reality asa mindless material accident, then we will not think twice about ruthlesslyexploiting Nature for short-term gain and short-term profit. Similarly, if webelieve Nature can only be understood by tearing it to pieces and examining thesmallest fragments, then we shall not divine the greater picture.If, on the other hand, we embrace the ideas outlined in this book, our view ofNature might change and we might come to cherish Nature in the same way asaboriginal peoples. Of course, it is not necessary to entertain all the ideas inthis book in order to be environmentally conscientious. Rather, should naturalintelligence be deemed real, then we would do well to refrain from breakingharmony with its flow. If we veer too far from the ways of natural intelligence,we will run the risk of being abandoned by the great system that birthed us. Orworse, we might even jeopardize the future of all life on Earth.Not that I really think such a thing could come to pass. One should notunderestimate the cohesive power natural intelligence. It is not like life is anold car that could splutter and give out all of a sudden. If evolving life werethat frail, it would surely have faded away long ago. The same applies to humanculture. Despite evincing ecological insensitivity that might instigate itsdownfall, culture embodies tremendous cohesion and resilience, which gives ustime to mature and change. And if we bring to mind the notion that the Universeis like a self-writing story, I would hope the human race is too significant aprotagonist to simply eliminate.It might be that the severe environmental crises our species has set in motionof late are a kind of violent prelude to the changes in culture and scientificworldview that lie ahead. Indeed, our global disruptions of the biosphereobviously serve to make us reflect on our important causal role within the webof life. When weather systems run riot around us, when otherwise unchanging icecaps begin to melt, when vast tracts of land are trashed in the quest for fossilfuel, when entire lakes and oceans become spoiled by pollution, when anestimated one hundred species of organism become extinct every day due to ourbelligerent presence, when acid rain ruins forests and crops, when fires burnuncontrollably in tropical areas where land has been decimated by farmerspandering to beef addiction, and when primarily profit-motivated biotechconglomerates cause unforeseen ecological disruptions with geneticallyengineered crops, then it is evident that our species is not a passive spectatorof Nature. Rather we actively influence its constitution at every moment.Shifting PerspectivesAs Fritjof Capra remarks in The Turning Point, the Chinese written word forcrisis contains two characters—danger and opportunity (or at least this is onelinguistic interpretation). This implies that we now have an opportunity to makea change for the better. We can learn from our ecological perturbations andrespond to them, as if ecological crises were parts of a biospherical enzymecoded into the historical process (enzymes facilitate reactions). Acknowledgingour devastating impact on Nature allows us to reappraise our relationship to theEarth. In so doing we dimly perceive that we are bound to the biosphere as muchas the biosphere is bound to us. Moreover, until we fully realize our purpose atthe hands of natural intelligence, it seems doubtful that we will be fulfillingour allotted role within its magnificent orchestrations.I would like to believe that as we move through the third millennium, therealization of our true purpose will become increasingly apparent. In otherwords, it is my hope that the proverbial old chestnut “what is the meaning oflife?” will be answered as the elusive meaning continues to unfold. In fact, ifwhat I have written bears any truth, such a realization is inevitable. Perhapsothers will explore Nature’s wild entheogenic fungi and reach the sameconclusions. Or perhaps scientists will begin to discuss those aspects ofreality that have conspired to facilitate a self-conscious Universe and concludethat our Universe really is of profound significance. And if scientists shouldcome to accept that everything is made of information, including consciousness,then perhaps they would also see that this information is becoming ever moreintegrated according to the intent of natural intelligence.image [../Images/9781594779374_003.jpg]Our unusual quest is over. We set out to uncover the essential face of Natureand discovered that, as a naturally evolved species, we are caught up in arapidly accelerating flow of information integration whose leading edge ispartly focused here on Earth, particularly within our conscious perception andour digital culture. This unfolding process would appear to be impressivelysmart and directed toward some culmination point. Only the future can reveal thetruth of these bold assertions. In the anticipatory meantime we can do no morethan contemplate the issues and ideas raised and hope for the best. May thesacred wisdom of Great Nature be with you always and everywhere."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/9781594779374_002.jpg]E P I L O G U ETrick or Treat?I provided the reader with a model of consciousness that views it as a flowingpattern of information generated within an intelligent, self-organizingUniverse. Once one has accepted that we and all other patterns of informationare natural expressions of a self-writing language-based Universe, that Natureis everywhere smart and contextually significant, then one is compelled to go onto examine the “meaning of it all.” Only when the bigger picture has begun to beglimpsed will we realize more fully our function and responsibilities withinNature and what integrative global events to expect in the near future. Isuggested that one route to ascertaining the bigger picture is to alter theinformation converging in the psyche by utilizing Nature’s ambient entheogenicagents. To do so is to suddenly change one’s relationship with the rest of thereality process such that one comes to be informed by the transcendental Other,the will, or intention, or intelligence that permeates Nature.It is my firm hope that others will be able to bring back some of the profoundinsights to be gained from the psilocybin mushroom experience in order that acomprehensive knowledge base develop. In fact, you might recall that in chapter4, I detailed the second wave of human-based psychedelic research. After asociopolitically engendered empirical hiatus of some thirty years or more,scientists are once more exploring the healing potential of entheogens. Withregard to the Johns Hopkins University of Medicine experiment I alluded to inchapter 4 in which psilocybin provoked positive mystical experiences in healthyvolunteers, here is a summary of the findings of a 14-month follow-up study. Theresults are encouraging and speak for themselves:At the 14-month follow-up, 58% and 67%, respectively, of volunteers rated thepsilocybin-occasioned experience as being among the five most personallymeaningful and among the five most spiritually significant experiences of theirlives; 64% indicated that the experience increased well-being or lifesatisfaction; 58% met criteria for having had a ‘complete’ mystical experience.1[../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts48]It remains for me only to give some more information as to the particulars ofthe psilocybin mushroom. After all, without verifying my claims, you will notknow whether I fabricated the principal subject matter of this book. Indeed,perhaps the themes outlined herein have been a kind of fake, nothing more than afew wild and woolly tales built upon the fertile imagination of my mind duringperiods when it was too wet to venture outside. Maybe at heart I am really oneof the archetypal “merelyist” reductionists of the bleak “null hypothesis”persuasion, but one who felt like writing an entertaining yarn in which theUniverse could be conceived as being meaningful instead of a mindless accident.The message, of course, is that one must always think for oneself and never takeanything for granted. That, surely, is indisputable. This leaves the psilocybinmushroom experience itself as the chief substance of my unusual claims. Butreaders must make up their own minds as to this claim of mine that the mushroomaffords useful knowledge. Let no one accuse me of reckless pointing. This bookhas been my pointer. You choose. You decide.As stated elsewhere, psilocybin mushrooms of one sort or another grow throughoutthe world—all over Europe, North and South America, Australia, New Zealand,Indonesia, Thailand, and Africa, for example. It seems that new psilocybinspecies are continually being discovered. But what is more astonishing than thisbiospherical bounty is the commercial availability of psilocybin mushroom sporesas well as growing kits. In many European countries it is now possible topurchase such equipment. However, the various legal issues involved incultivating the mushroom are far from clear at this time.Under some European laws the fresh psilocybin mushroom is not controlled (atleast at the time of writing). This means that the wild mushroom is not listedas a controlled substance, and personal mushroom use is allowed (but not theirsale). In the United Kingdom, until recently only the isolated activeingredients psilocybin and psilocin were controlled by law (their classificationas highly dangerous is questionable and may well be challenged in the comingyears). Thus, as long as the mushroom remained in its raw, unprocessed state, itwas deemed legal by the United Kingdom authorities. However, 2005 saw the UnitedKingdom government illegalize the actual wild mushroom itself. This wasunprecedented, as it was the first time that a natural part of the UnitedKingdom countryside had been deemed illegal.It remains to be seen what becomes of this unwarranted draconian measure that,by condemning a natural and long-revered environmental resource, can serve onlyto further alienate us from Nature. Indeed, one might think that notice boardsought to be placed throughout all the parks and wilderness areas of the UnitedKingdom warning citizens of the extreme dangers of naturally occurringpsilocybin mushrooms (simple possession of the mushroom could entail a jailsentence). Having personally observed prolific numbers of Psilocybe semilanceatagrowing in most of the United Kingdom’s countryside areas during the autumnmonths (this includes the whole of the Lake District; the whole of Snowdonia;the whole of Dartmoor; the Devonshire coast; the Welsh coast; as well asLondon’s Richmond Park, Streatham Common, and Hampstead Heath), there would needto be thousands of such notice boards. Unless, that is, the government proposesdrenching all wild, green areas with millions of gallons of eco-unfriendlyfungicide. Or create a vast group of Rangers (with a tactical airborne division)to scour and police every inch of the countryside. Or simply seal off thecountryside and people’s gardens (including land owned by the Queen) untilfurther notice.Of course, I am being deliberately provocative here—but only to highlight theabsurdity of making a natural part of the environment illegal. In any case,these laws have not prevented the sale of psilocybin mushroom spores (Psilocybespores do not contain psilocybin) nor the growth media in which to cultivatethem. The only feasible way to prevent this kind of activity would be to ban theair itself, as fungal spores of one kind or another are omnipresent.If the more cautious reader is concerned with the health risks associated withconsumption of the mushroom, we should note that a 2000 report from a Dutch RiskAssessment Team (copies of the report, by CAM—the Coordination Centre for theAssessment and Monitoring of New Drugs—can be located on the Internet) foundthat psilocybin mushroom use does not present a significant public health risk(at the time of the report, the mushroom had been commercially available in theNetherlands for many years).2 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts49] Similarly, arigorous scientific study by Hasler and others published in 2004 showed thatpsilocybin was not hazardous to health when administered to healthy persons(although the study recommended that those with high blood pressure shouldabstain from psilocybin use).3 [../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts50] A UnitedKingdom Home Office report of 2000 also stated that mushroom use was notconsidered problematic.*1 [../Text/9781594779374_ftn.htm#ftn1] 4[../Text/9781594779374_nts.htm#nts51] And this is despite the fact that anestimated 1.5 million adult people in the United Kingdom had taken the mushroom.In the last analysis, if the powers that be are truly concerned about thepossible public health hazards associated with psilocybin mushroom use, thenthey are obliged to investigate the matter professionally by consultingscientific experts in the field. Simply illegalizing the natural, nonaddictivemushroom by categorizing it alongside addictive manufactured heroin and crackcocaine (which is the case in many countries) is, it must be said, a tadhysterical. The inordinately oppressive nature of this kind of legislationagainst a sacred substance speaks for itself. On the other hand, maybe TerenceMcKenna was right when he suggested that psilocybin fungi had a sort ofmysterious defense mechanism around them so as to prevent mass profane use. Whoknows?Putting aside the various legal issues, the question still remains as to thesignificance of the mushroom’s growing popularity (along with Amazonianayahuasca). It is possible that psilocybin’s potential is coming of age (atleast in those parts of the world where the mushroom remains legal or where itgrows in abundance). After all, the capacity of psilocybin to forge a newrelationship between humanity and Nature is probably more important now than atany other time in history. Given our relentless despoiling of the biosphere andour unending obsession with material consumption, it is evident that we havealienated ourselves from the larger systems of Nature of which we are a part.Cities are like cocoons that sever us from the rest of the biosphere. We liveand breathe without a second thought about the life-support system that is allof Nature. Naturally occurring entheogens can be viewed as a latent biosphericalhomeostatic control mechanism whereby our species can be brought back intobalance. Indeed, it may be our last chance before we push the biosphere intototal decline. As I intimated in the preliminary note at the very start of thisbook, the mushroom can be considered a kind of antidote in that the knowledge itcan yield can help heal our currently misguided relations with the rest of theweb of life. In fact, I would liken psilocybin to a kind of psychologicalpenicillin. Whereas penicillin is a fungal product with valuable antibiotichealing properties, psilocybin is a fungal product with valuableeco-psychological healing properties. Unlike penicillin however, psilocybin has,unfortunately, yet to find a global audience wise to its virtues.Regarding the issue of dosage, stronger doses of the mushroom—those trulyentheogenic doses that can change one’s attitude toward life and that alsogalvanized me into writing this book—should only be employed with plenty ofexperience. Most important are one’s state of mind prior to consumption andone’s surroundings. One should be in a positive and balanced frame of mindbefore consuming the mushroom (people suffering from mental health problems likeschizophrenia or chronic depression should absolutely avoid the mushroom). Oneshould also be in a friendly and safe environment that is free of distraction.The mushroom is not some frivolous party drug to be washed down with a beer insome noisy club. I would also suggest a period of sexual abstinence prior toingestion, as one will then be in a more “pure” state befitting a potentiallysacred experience. And unless one is particularly competent in the ancient artof self-knowledge, it is advisable to have a non-bemushroomed close friendaround to act as a kind of anchor should any feelings of panic arise. It isimportant that this “sitter” remain as unobtrusive as possible. If all theconditions are right and enough heartfelt preparation has been made, anexperience in which one’s perception is fantastically enhanced is almost certainto follow.To experience the mushroom’s visionary effect, one should lie down in silencewith eyes closed during the period when the mushroom’s influence is most active.Although this is a decidedly daunting venture, the colorful splendor ofpsilocybinetic visions and their unmistakable revelational quality make it verymuch worthwhile.If psilocybin mushrooms are consumed on an empty stomach, their effects may befelt within as little as twenty minutes. (Taking them on an empty stomach ispreferable because they are stronger that way and the act of fasting prior toingestion becomes, like sexual abstinence, somewhat ritually symbolic.) Ifmushrooms are consumed after a meal, the effects can take up to an hour and ahalf to emerge. In either case, the first changes that one notices are likely tobe somatic, in that one might feel a little restless and edgy. This would appearto be the initial reaction of the body and the psyche to the mushroom’s exoticinfluence, a sort of “retuning” process. These mild uneasy feelings generallysubside as one’s perception gradually begins to open up and expand. One is thenbathed in a decidedly warm and numinous presence.I find it curiously apt that an adventure into the nature of reality shouldgravitate around a wild fungus native to most parts of the Earth’s surface. Itreally is the case that we can turn to Nature if we wish to fully comprehend thesense and significance of our lives. This is like the plot of some elaborateadult fairy tale. If we genuinely wish to gain self-knowledge and realize ourplace within Nature’s endlessly creative transmutations, we can deliberatelyseek out and consume the “truth.” Like cosmic actors, by performing an age-oldritual act in time and space, we can perceive the world afresh and anew. Throughpsilocybinetic gnosis we may even glimpse the full majesty of this astoundingUniverse in which we are so privileged to find ourselves.And so I end my enthusiastic tale. The sacred mushroom now beckons, affording uscommunion with the natural intelligence of which we are a part. Astonishingly,such a communion may be nearer than ever. The choice is wholly yours. Born inthe 1950s and 1960s, the sacred endeavor in which the doors of perception arethrust wide apart is set to blossom in the coming years. Be there."},{"pageContent":"Footnote*1.
